Once you get into the actual building you wander through a hallway of shops that reminds you of a bad mall that is about to close for good.  First impressions mean a lot.  Clearly not a lot of thought was put into this.

Once you are off the escalator and into the lobby it gets much better.  The lobby area is huge and it looks good.  The elevators to the guest rooms are actually close to the lobby.  More casinos should be set up that way.

The rooms look nice.  They are good sized.  The bed is very comfotable.  The bathroom is quite nice.

My issue with the rooms is the television.  You can be operating a serious hotel of any kind with 27"" tube televisions.  This needs to be fixed.  Even the Tropicana now has 42"" hi def flat screens in most rooms if not all rooms.

I liked that there was a 24 hour shop right by the elevators.  It made it easy to get a cola or a snack any time of day since there was not a minibar in the room.

There are a lot of options for food.  From fast food to the only five star place for hundreds of miles.  It is a great idea to have multiple Starbucks.

The pool are is quite a walk from the hotel rooms.  It is a very nice complex.  It was nice to have at least one pool off to the side for adults only.  The service at the pool was good and there are a lot of lounge chairs.

The gaming area is nice and quite large.  There is a nice spread of minimums to fit most budgets.  Most of the dealers are friendly and helpful.

The MGM Grand will now be an option for me when I visit Las Vegas.  The rates are competitive with casinos that offer far less.",2,0,0

If you want action, MGM is hopping 24\/7 with action. The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says ""The City of Entertainment,"" you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. 

From a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. 

Of all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.

I can't think of a better place if you've never been to Vegas and want the experience without laying down a boatload of cash to get it. I will always rotate MGM into my stays in Vegas. It was my first and will always hold a special place in my heart.",1,1,1

I'm surprised it took me this long to stay at the MGM Grand. I've always said I was going to, I made sure this time I did, and I'm very happy I did.

We stayed on the 25th floor. The room was excellent. Very spacious. I was very impressed with the amount of space in the room. From the pictures online, I didn't think it would be as much space as it was. I'm happy that it was. The bed was ultra comfortable, once you laid down, you didn't want to get back up! The views of outside were great, especially at night when all the other hotels on the strip are lit up. 

The casino has tons or table games to partake in. I'm not much of a slot person, but if you enjoy those there's plenty here to play on. The sports book is one of the better looking ones I've been too. Tons of televisions for you to catch all the action.

The staff here was very good. It was a long line to check in, but that was expected with it being on a Friday and a big UFC match happening that next day, so it wasn't a big deal to me. The front desk staff was working hard to get everyone checked in quickly. The line move pretty quick based on the amount of people in line. We also had a problem with our iron in our room. We called the front desk and someone brought a new one up immediately. I was also greeted with a lot of hello and hi's from the staff when walking around the hotel. 

The MGM Grand is a great hotel. I love the location of it, tons of cool and fun things in pretty close walking distance. Once I complete my quest of staying in all the nice hotels on the strip, MGM Grand will probably be my go to hotel to stay at when visiting Las Vegas.",3,2,3

The service was top notch from the moment we arrived. When we pulled up to the valet, he welcomed us and told us to take as long as we needed ""since we are now on vacation."" Most of the times these car monkeys spend longer holding their hand out for a tip then they do talking to you. 

Check in had long lines but after spending about three minutes in the line, a service agent with a handheld ""ipad"" device checked me in. WOW I'm in my room in less then 15 mins and ready to gamble. 

Too my surprise all the bars, including their main bar, had .25 video blackjack and the free drinks started flowing at .25 a hand. No attitude just smiles. 

Since I was with my child, I took an upgrade to a much larger room so I'm biased regarding the room quality. Our room was spacious, clean and fabulous.

The rooms are clean and remodeled - could use a DVD player though. Our 2 queen suite had a sectional sitting area with flat screen. 2nd flat screen in front of beds.. About 700 sq ft pretty nice (not the ritz but not bad at all).

$56 to check out @ 6pm. Room service was reasonably priced and faster service than dining in the restaurants.

Plenty of towels (ask any housekeeping member for towels when you see them walking down the halls.)

Never had any complaints, played our beats all day and night (of course we self monitored) you best believe we got rowdy with guests in and out the room 24\/7...ALL GOOD!

Upon walking up to the check-in desk, we were greeted by a friendly employee. She checked us in and even called over a manager (Jeremy DaSilva) who made sure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as quick as Andre N. and didn't think to ask for an upgrade. Luckily, we didn't really need one because our renovated room (a Grand King room) was pretty sweet. Apparently, the people of MGM have been hard at work on this renovation...and their hard work paid off.

Our room was great. Some of the highlights? Definitely the electric blinds...I love a dark room and these made everything so dark and perfect for sleeping. The bed helped too. I have serious sleeping issues and my back is always sore after sleeping in a new bed. This was not the case in the new Grand King room. The pillow-top mattress wasn't too soft or too hard and it wasn't alcohol that helped me pass out so easily. I do have to agree with Jacob H. that there wasn't quite enough water pressure in the shower, but that's not a big deal to me. My husband and I definitely took advantage of the media hub they installed that included places to charge all your electronics. What a clever idea!

The main reason I'm not bumping MGM up to five stars is because of their wifi. It really struggled to connect all weekend long and that was in both our room and the rest of the hotel. We were lucky to get one bar on our iphone and ipad. Kind of annoying...especially when you can walk into other hotels and immediately have a stronger connection. 

The best part of our stay was by far the complimentary champagne, waters, and sweets that the Director of Hotel Operations, Shadi Omeish, had sent up on Friday night. What a great welcome! We also loved the special discount the hotel gave us upon checking out. The MGM had already provided Yelp Spring Break discounts, but this discount really went above and beyond!

We stayed at MGM during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, so it was way crowded.  This is to be expected.  However, what was not expected was MGM doing work on the 24 hour coffee shop, which is typically the best (and at least most reliable) place to get breakfast in a casino.  It was poor planning to have this construction going on during one of the busiest Vegas weekends.  So, that was annoying.

The rooms are solid but not spectacular.  One thing that's nice about MGM Grand is there is a broad spectrum of things to eat, from a food court to Joel Robuchon.  Craftsteak is always a winner in my experience.  You have a good amount of dining options here.

I've been to several concerts at the Grand Garden Arena.  They do a great job of getting you in and out quickly.

We stayed on the 8 th floor with a wonderful view of the maintenance area\/service area after we were told the view was nice.  The room would not cool down, the room had a smell that would not go away and a safe that wouldn't work.   
The casino wasn't much better.  Waitresses didn't come by often at all, so playing craps and plus paying $8 for a beer sucked, the casino itself was hotter than the other casinos we went into. 
The grounds were not clean as well.  After walking around on our trip and then coming back to the mgm we noticed how dirty and trash filled the property was.  
I'll be back in December but will not be staying at the MGM. 
While I appreciate the partial acknowledgment of my review Lori, (only the cleanliness part was acknowledged), the dishonesty about the rooms  view by hotel staff and condition of the west wing room was not acknowledged.

The beds at MGM are, as always, really comfy! The living space was great with a lounger sofa, coffee table, side chair, table with 2 chairs, and a wet bar with a small fridge. The washroom was massive with 2 sinks, a side shower, and a lovely whirlpool spa. The whirlpool spa was definitely a bonus after a long day of exploring the strip!

We asked for a complimentary upgrade from the grand tower to something better.  The girl at the front desk said they do not offer it, but when we got to our rooms we found out that she did in fact upgraded it for us.  AWESOME!!

The decor is very modernized like what everybody else said, until we start discovering more and more negatives.  Yes the pillow and blanket is made out of down, which also explains why there's a lot of stuff that pokes at you.  The sheets had makeup stains on them and I even found some sort of bug shell in it, GROSS! Maybe I was just being self-conscious, but I couldn't stop scratching my legs either.  

This room doesn't really have anything; I guess hotels don't  come with a fridge and a coffee maker these days either.  The shower stalls were poorly designed.  After showering, you'd have to step all the way out just to retrieve your towel.  they had a poor draining system, too! When i opened the doors, there was a pool of water right in front of the stalls.  I had to use 3 towels to soak up the water -_-  Cleaning up the water mess took longer than cleaning myself up in the showers.  

The room only looks cool.  Avoid at all costs even if it's a complimentary upgrade.  This room is best for couples because as other yelpers have described, the bathroom is just enclosed with frosted glasses, lol, and you can pretty much hear everything that goes on in there.",3,3,2

You cannot call it complimentary if you are charging for it.  Last time I checked, complimentary means ""given free as a courtesy or favor.""  Furthermore,  we reserved a room in the west wing that was advertised to have the amenities of a flat screen tv and high speed internet access.  Damn MGM! There you go again with your misleading advertisement and failing to provide said promise.  This room did not have a flat screen tv as advertised. It looked like an 18 inch old school tv.

Well it was newer so we took that. Got into the room and realized it was not newer! Ha called front desk who sent us to a newer king room. Needless to say the room was nicer and newer but was still left much to be desired.

Want breakfast? That will be $19-$30 for some eggs, a McDonald's style hashbrown, and toast. A basic premade salad? $15.75. A drink? $10-$20. And that's just in the cheapest parts of the hotel. 

Let's look at our room. First, when we got to registration, we waited in line half an hour only to be told that we were in the wrong place, they sent us to another part of the hotel. We lugged all our luggage and the baby, across the hotel. They tell us we need to go back to normal registration... So we lug it all back where we get to stand in line again, this time for 45 minutes. We finally get back to the desk where we find the last attendant had deleted our registration. Since we had booked this trip through a booking agent, the money we paid was not refunded, and we were without a place to sleep. We pulled out an emergency credit card and bought a room. Meanwhile, the baby is hungry and crying, and everything we had booked for that day is one by one being canceled. We get to our room only to be hit with the overwhelming smell of mildew and the sight of other peoples hair in the bed sheets. The baby starts coughing and soon we all are. 

We call our booking agent and find that they did everything they were supposed to and it was the hotel that had messed up. So we spend the next two hours on the phone trying to not only get our money back but get a new room as well. We have to stay the night in the room. We move the offending sheets to a corner of the room and try to put the crib in the least smelling part of the tiny room. But the baby coughed and cried all night anyway. They moved us to a new, slightly bigger room the next day. 

I was impressed with the size of the shampoo and conditioner bottles until it took the entire bottle to cover my relatively short hair. The pool was the best part of the hotel, by far. With a bunch of different pools and a lazy river, it was nice. Their times have a lot to answer for, however. They open late in the morning and close early in the evening.

Tip: check-in online through the email they send you; it allows you to skip past waiting in the general line!

The room was pretty small but had a comfy king size bed.  I thought the room design was outdated and no irrational.  The bathroom was open, literally a glass door that encloses the toilet and the shower. There isn't a fan at all which allowed for mold to grow in the shower! The room itself is pretty dim, only one window above the bed which got no direct sunlight whatsoever.  Also I kept waking up in the night from what I thought was vibrations of slamming doors of the showers in the hotel...turned out there was construction happening next door! 
My recommendation is upgrade to the next room up! My friends upgraded to the two queen beds (at additional cost) and it was spacious and the bathroom at least is enclosed for privacy! 

I really don't understand why the fitness room is located all the way across the casino.  I understand the marketing strategy but from the point of the view of the guest, it's convenient for them to have it located in the same hotel tower. Although, the fitness center is larger than some I've been to on the strip and has a nice view overlooking the pool! 

I've been to Vegas almost every year since I was little and parking was always free! As of late, MGM and its partnering casinos (Mirage, MonteCarlo, Luxor,etc) charge parking per hour.

After I checked in on Friday, I informed bell desk how good their dry cleaning service is because I have a very expensive sweater and I don't trust many places cleaning it.

The staff informed me it will be in good hands and great care will be taken care of it. After mailing it over for about 10-15 minutes, I decide to go ahead and trust these guys with my item. (Surely a hotel of this stature is on top of things like this). 

The employees give me a confusing piece of paper to fill out, and after 10 hours of traveling to get to Vegas I wasn't thinking clearly and checked off my sweater under ""laundry"". 

I get my sweater back two days later, and find out it is two sizes too small and fuzzy. My $1000 sweater is now unwearable. 

I confront the bell desk, and the manager informs me that they do not know what happened because the MGM does not dry clean their clothes, they send everything to a separate company to handle it. (Never was explained this before). 

I explained to manager how my sweater was clearly not dry cleaned but washed in a harsh cycle and it is ruined. Upon further inspection of my receipt, the manager points out that I had checked my sweater off under ""laundry"" tab. I explain to manager that their paperwork is BS and I specially asked for dry cleaning not laundry and how did their 2 employees assisting me not catch my mistake or volunteer to fill out the form. The answer was, ""well I'm sorry about that, would you like me to send it to out to get it washed again and maybe stretched"" 

Thank you MGM for costing me $1000 and not being transparent. I will be filing a civil lawsuit.",0,2,0

Upon check in after a long flight from NY, I waited in line to check in for ONE HOUR to check in. As I tried to find my room, I was tripping over children (yes, children sleeping in the floor and sitting at slots in the casino), and that was an experience. All of the elevators to get to your room are in the middle, that's right, the middle, of the casino.  

Upon entering the elevator (which anyone from the street can access as there is no security or any measures to keep people outside of the hotel from wandering around to your door), I was greeted with a stink of garbage, marijuana and old spilled beer--ugh. 

Upon entering my room, it appeared near, UNTIL I noticed something on the portrait in my room---a SEMEN STAIN from God known when.  I called
The desk, who sent me to the concierge, who did nothing. That was Sunday. 

Monday, stain still there even though cleaning person was in room (the who hotel is filthy, so who knows what's going on), so again, why she didn't see it, I don't  know. Inwas told by Hotel Manager 1 that it would be taken care of.  It wasn't.

Tuesday morning:!went to concierge who directed, and personally walked my husband and I to her.  She didn't believe us (we had photos, unfortunately) and suggested that maybe someone was paining a mounding and it dropped on the paining.  Umm, no!  She refused to take any responsibility or to make it right and said it would be taken care of immediately.  Since the room hadn't been clean yet, I figured ""okay"".  Nothing was done seven hours later. 

Tuesday afternoon, my husband went to complain (after I was left on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak to a manager) and was told it would be taken care of. 

Tuesday evening: we return from a great night and find that the stain is now smeared on the painting, but there's 8 extra towels in the bathroom.  WHAT????  I decided to go down to the front desk at 9:15 (less than an hour ago) and clear this up.  I was told by WOODY (how apropos to my situation) that he will send someone up to clean it right then (at 9:30 pm, no!). I told him of how I spent a lot money in his hotel and could have stayed somewhere else better for less: example the ""Delano""). I told him how grossed out I was and he shrugged and said he and his girlfriend where in the same position last month and they were ""powerless"" too.  First of all: I don't care; secondly: then do better than what you had.  

It left off with him saying his hotel is too large to help everyone and that he has no control over house keeping.   I suggest that Woody read the want ads to find a job where he can pass the buck and be proud of the anarchy and jungle he is helping to build.  (Hey, he may be good for the DNC---kidding, sort of). 

Anyway, the real gem was his last statement to me "" You're leaving tomorrow anyway, so what difference does it make if you stay in the room one more?"". I'm sure Hooters and Motel 6 accords the street are cleaner and run better.

We get to the room and it is any standard motel room.  No coffee pot, fridge, minibar, ipod dock.....really a crappy tv and radio is all you offer?  The bed is super comfy, the towels are stained (yes stained!)
We went to the pool one day and by 9:30a the chairs were all taken, so we got a cabana.  Nice but not worth 400 bucks, the waiter was good though.  The floating river was filthy - empty cups, straws, bottles.  What idiot thought it was a good idea to let a lot of hos and bros trapsy around with their drinks in the water.

The hallways are always freezing but the hotel rooms AC doesn't work so great.  
The lions are depressing.
Apparently a very common switch is to say the main tower if full so they send you to the ""upgraded"" West Wing.  What a dump!  The elevators look like beat up old freight elevators.  The poor people on the first floor are in a hallway that leads to the elevators - I'd be pissed if I was them.  And the rooms - you can put in all the leather and all the mirrors you want it won't hide the fact that the room is soooo small the bed blocks the window.  Don't fall for the ""upgrade"".

I stayed in a single room and it was pretty nice.  MGM has definitely upgraded since I stayed here a few years ago.  I remember that the blinds and curtains had to be opened\/closed manually so I was happy to see this change.  

I was happy with everything about the room except for two things:

1.  It took me a while to find the light switch.  There is a switch for the small hallway when you enter, and then you have to turn on each of the 3 lamps around the room.  I wish there was just one switch on the wall to turn on\/off the lights.  

2.  The cable connection kept getting disconnected!!  I stayed up until about 4am watching tv and the cable turned off at least 4 times!  The cable was off for just a couple of minutes but it was pretty annoying.  I usually don't watch tv while I'm in Vegas, but the one time I do it sucked, haha.

Price wise it was cheaper than the other hotels on the strip.  Like the other Yelpers stated, the line to check in was soo long, I must have stood there for about 45 minutes.  

Ok, so I got a non-smoking room.  I walked into my room and it reeked of smoke.  Called the front desk and asked what kind of room was I given? It was confirmed that it was non-smoking.  I can just imagine how the smoking rooms must stink!

Walls are paper thin.  One night there was a party next door, sounded like a bachelorette party.  The following night I figured it might be somewhat less noisy, and what did I get on the other side? a couple that must have been making a porno movie.  Granted, it's Vegas, the city that never sleeps..but damn after gambling, drinking and dancing you want to catch a couple of zzzz's to have the energy to do it again for the next couple of days.

It's been just about one week since we've been back from Las Vegas, and I'm still bothered by our experience at MGM. Thankfully we only had one night there. Admittidly we booked the room to be able to use the lazy river. I wish I had known we'd be paying $30 for one drink at the bar outside. 

First, check-in was extremely long. Their mobile check in was 'down' so everyone had to wait in line. It was only 12pm, but the line wrapped back and forth a few times. When we got to the desk, there was a hard sell on an upgrade. We ended up doing it when we were told it was 'a nicer tower with a much better view, especially of the pool'. That was a total lie. We had a low floor view of the building. The rooms, and elevators, were all extremely dark.

We spent what was left of the day at the pool, and then the casino at night. We got to our room at about midnight, and went to bed. We were awoken at 2:30am by an extremely loud crash into our door. Being woken out of a dead sleep by what sounded like someone breaking into the room was not pleasant. My boyfriend looked out the peephole to see what was going on, only to see a hooker and a John fighting in the hallway. While I understand you can't control how guests act, it was how security acted that really upset me. I called security and we waited in our room for them to arrive while listening to the screaming and fighting. My boyfriend met the security guards in the hallway, and pointed them to the room a few doors down where the guy was. The woman came back at him, still screaming, while security looked on. They allowed them to continue to yell and stomp down the hallway and throw items. A few times my boyfriend asked the guard that was by our door if he could please remove them from our floor because I was still visibly bothered by the fighting, as I was trying to come down from the adrenaline rush from being woken up. Instead of separating the hooker and the John to sort out the issue, he told my boyfriend to be quiet as if he were the problem. When they eventually calmed down after about 15 minutes, security walked the female away, and the man went back to his room. When we left in the morning, they were taking off his bloodied hotel room door as he watched on.

We waited in the long check-out line to bring up the issue. They basically said 'sorry' and took off the resort fee. $35 compensation for a horrendous nights sleep. They took no responsibility for being unable or unwilling to take control of a bad situation and make their guests feel safe. We were also assured that he was removed from the property, which was a lie, seeing as we saw him twice that next morning. Once outside his room, and once in the lobby.

The hallway does indeed go on forever. Once you finally get to your room, be prepared to see a nice modern little space. There is enough seating for perhaps 4 people to be comfortable...or perhaps 10 very drunk and happy people who don't mind standing on the bed or in the closet and in other various places in the room. The beds are very comfortable and the blackout curtains are among the best I've come across in Vegas hotels. Not an ounce of light leaks into the room. Room service will cost you your first born.

MGM has recently done renovations, and the rooms and hallways look great. They are very much up to ""Vegas standards"". 

However, MGM was originally opened in 1993, so some items that aren't cosmetic haven't been upgraded:

1) Such as the ventilation in the casino and rooms. MGM is very smokey and you will notice it in your hair\/clothing. Also, the AC in our room took a LONG time to cool the room down. 

2) The shower was a little wonky as well. The faucet would run while the shower was running, and the water had the potential to get extremely hot.  

PMGM is cheaper than other hotels, so it's a good choice for someone on a budget who would still like to be on the strip. 

What I did like: 

 1) Having an M Life card. It's free to sign up and allowed us to get a discount on Zumanity tickets. (The price dropped from $115 to $75\/person!) 
A lot of hotels don't offer discounts to their guests when booking through the concierge, so that was great. 
This card also gives you a discount at the small convenient store in the lobby. 

2) The pool area is very nice. There is more than one pool available and extras like a volleyball net and inner tubes are available for free. The chairs are comfortable and there are lots available. 

3) The cafeteria. Dining on a budget? McDonald's and Nathans are some of the fast food available. They also have a Starbucks in the casino. 

4) MGM is located on a busy part of the strip. There are lots of shops and other hotels to walk to from MGM.

This review is just of the casino's staff treatment:

I was walking through the casino with my parents to get back to their sister property, the Signature. My parents stopped by one of the machines and my mom wanted to show me something. One of the employees stopped me and this I didn't mind because ,granted, I do look young for my age and do look underage compared to others. But his attitude and the way he handled the situation appalled me. He was incredibly rude towards me and was basically accusing me of underage gambling even though we were just standing by one of the machines. He didn't even ask me for ID at first. He just kept questioning me about my age and when he finally asked for my ID, he didn't do so very nicely. When he finally verified my age by slowly calculating the difference between 2017 and my birth year, he just looked angry (probably because he was so excited to try and kick someone out of the casino). All he could say was ""Oh....you look really young..."" and then tried to leave hurriedly and threw a quick and angry ""sorry about that"" before running off quickly.

Look, I get it... minors try to gamble all the time and you're just trying to do your job. But you're in the customer services industry, at least try to be friendly. I was in Vegas for two full days and I was carded at multiple other establishments, but none of the other casinos handled the situation as poorly as MGM Grand. Rather, at other casinos, I actually struck up a friendly and fun conversation with the attendants who carded me and had a lovely time speaking with them. Honestly speaking, you should learn from your sister properties. They know how to do customer service right and well at their casinos!",0,0,0

Nothing worth to take home (shampoo, soap bar, and face wash). The thing I like about this place is that on the first floor, there is a water fountain in the middle. It is gorgeous. 

The hotel has a buffet inside and the food is pretty decent. I think any brunch buffet is good. Why? Cuz they have scrambled eggs and toast! Other than that, everything was mediocre.

Casino is sorta big and pretty crowded. That craps table is a ripped off lol. But that black jack machine...whooooo!

Price is expensive in general to me. it doesnt matter if it is during an event or not, just too much moola for muah.",3,1,3

It felt very ""Spring-Break"", and this is after Labor Day. Summer is over. My wife and I were having a nice dinner at Tom Colicchio Craftsteak. Beautiful establishment and fine food. And there was a table with ten young adults in front of us loud, breaking glassware, falling asleep and getting each separate checks.

I requested a room close to the elevator after reading other suggestions to do so and they were accommodating. They had just finished cleaning my room so I was able to check in early and they didn't even charge me the early check in fee!

I don't travel often so maybe my 5 star rating would be different than yours. The room was clean, big bathroom, somewhat comfortable bed, I had a window to look out of. I don't require a lot of perks while traveling as I'm not in the room much. 

Minibar is censored so they know when you take something out of it. I was too tired to walk down to the store one night and spent the $4.50 on a can of soda. 

My only negative was the second day the air coming in from the AC smelled like cigarette smoke. It was disgusting. 

Like everything else on the strip the food here is so expensive. And don't even think about ordering room service. $13 for oatmeal? Don't forget to read the fine print of the $4.95 service charge. My feet hurt so bad one night after walking 15 miles that I wanted to order in but after seeing $22 for a burger + $4.95 service charge I sucked it up and walked down the strip for some cheaper food

The main issue was that the first person who checked us in did not ask if we wanted a smoking room or not (which was a pretty big issue for my group). We called down to see if they could switch us from a nonsmoking to a smoking room to be told that it wasn't possible since they only have 2 floors throughout the hotel that allow smoking ( besides the lobby) , second issue was the promotion we booked 'guaranteed' us a strip view the view we were given was of a dirt lot .. not cool. Jessica told us that she could switch our rooms to smoking rooms the next day, but if we wanted a smoking room that day she could put us into a skyline marquee suite for $600 extra for our whole stay plus a $600 deposit. The price was a little much for us so we asked if she could maybe take 300 off .. about ten minutes later she came back and to our surprise she was able to give us the price we wanted ! SCORE! we also got a free bottle of champagne and 6 buffet passes to use on any day we pleased. The suite was marvelous ; 2 bedroom, 2 bath, a pool table, wet bar, full living room, and a dining area. Our trip started out a little rough but it was a blast after we got into our suite !

Everyone has their own taste and that's what makes Vegas so great: choices.

- Modern Style
- Great Location On-Strip
- Free Parking
- Various In-Hotel Entertainment
- Award Winning Restaurants
- Average Price
- Stay Classy

I however, prefer to stay in modern, comfortable and somewhat pricier hotels. Not because I am a snob, but because I deserve it. The MGM Grand has had many awards in the past for a reason, see for yourself: http:\/\/www.mgmgrand.com\/press_room\/press_room_awards.aspx

From dusk until dawn the MGM Grand has the ideal location on the strip, putting you within walking distance of some of the hottest clubs. If you're not much for walking, you can always hitch a cab out front. If that doesn't sounds ideal, you can always stay-in. My wife and I do all of the above on our trip to experience all that Vegas has to offer.

Sticking to the subject, MGM houses a variety of dining options such as  the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, and Emeril's New Orleans Fish House. For those on a budget the McDonalds is open for most of the day, though the lines get PACKED.

If you love Cirque du Soleil as much as I do, you'll be excited to know that MGM hosts KÀ which is a very crowd revolving movie-like experience. If you're into the clubs, ladies get in free while guys pay a small fee. Drop into Tabú ""ultra lounge"" or Studio 54 nightclub. Like most places in Vegas, the people get crazier (and more drunk) as the night goes on.

As far as the rooms go, they can be pretty tiny, although modern and comfortable. With just enough room to stick your suitcase in the bathroom shower, you'll be encouraged to stay in the Celebrity Spa Suite like my wife and I did.

The extra space of an oversized bedroom leaves room for an extended living area (that I never used) and a large dresser. This room can be great for a romantic extravaganza with it's whirlpool spa in the bathroom. Let the bubbles runneth over!

All-in-all you can stay fancy, sleep well and eat well without ever having to leave your own hotel. If you decide to leave, you are near all of the places on-strip you'd want to visit. I love the MGM Grand and continue to come back year after year.",0,1,0

For this stay, I decided the MGM Grand would be more suitable since we would be with friends. The MGM Grand has easier access to the casino and restaurants which is always convenient. I received an email offer, made our room reservation, and also requested away from the lazy river. 

The morning of our cabana request, I called the front desk as there was a message on the room phone. I was informed that we had been waitlisted for the cabana. I asked to speak to someone at the pool. I spoke to Brandon and asked if there was any possibility of us being accommodated with a cabana since my sister has a medical condition that restricts her from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. I was pleased when he informed me that we indeed have a cabana at the Producer's Pool. 

Upon arrival to the line for the cabana, I spoke to Kim Davidson. She informed me that Brandon should not have told me we had a cabana and that there was not one available to me. I was very displeased and explained to her that we exclusively stay at MLife hotels because of the great service. I also explained to her the importance of the cabana due to my sister's medical condition. Her demeanor was not what I am accustomed to as she was not welcoming, never smiled or greeted us. Instead, she made me and my guests feel as if we were somehow an inconvenience to her for the error that had been made. 

While I understand the error that was made on the part of the pool staff, there should have been a solution before we arrived to the cabana check-in. A guest should have not have to initiate a discussion about how the hotel will accommodate us for the error. Her initial response was that we were on the waitlist and did not have a cabana. I asked if there was something she could do to resolve the problem. She offered us a daybed for what normal rate. I explained to her that it would not be enough shade and my sister needed more coverage. While I did not expect any type of empathy on her part, I do always expect a pleasant demeanor as most MGM\/Signature employees display. She said there was another option...a cabana at Tower One or Two at The Signature. The rate was significantly less than that of the Producer Pool cabana. I was pleased as I assumed she was accommodating us with a lower than normal rate due to their error. Upon arrival to the cabana at The Signature, I was surprised that we were being charged their usual rate. Needless to say, I was not pleased with her lack of attention to attend guests and her stoic demeanor. This was a disappointing experience to our weekend getaway.",1,2,0

I freakin LOVE the pool area @ MGM Grand. Let me start with their lazy river.... AWESOME! It's a good sized river, fun w\/ or w\/out tubes. There are people hanging out and having fun. Once you've had your fill of the lazy river, which could take a while, there are about 3 other pools to choose from, one specificially banning the kiddies, which is nice if you're looking for a relatively quiet and splash-free zone.

The ROOM:
We had the Grand Executive King Suite and it was PHENOMENAL. Grand King suite room was spacious and well decorated. Super romantic and chic feel. However, I felt like the bathroom didn't match the room itself. The toilet was not enclosed in it's own room and the bathtub was only big enough for a teenager to lay in. The bathrooms at Caesar's Palace are MUCH better.

PROS:
- Checked in exactly at 3 and only waited less than 10 minutes
- Newly rennovated rooms- lobby area had a unique flowerly scent
- FREE WIFI
- Affordable for the room we got during a holiday

CONS:
-$30 per night ""resort fee"" which all hotels in vegas have. Complete BS if you ask me. It was way too cold to even use the pool.
-Charging $7 for champagne\/wine glasses and a $3 delivery fee to our room...just for glasses? No thanks. 
- Walls are thin. We could hear our hotel neighbors speaking in Chinese next door. Thankfully, they weren't loud.

QUICK MENTION: The $20 sandwich trick didn't work for us. At least the concierge guy returned the tip and said he could only accept if he did a good job. I should have just snagged it back but honestly, I felt bad. He tried to help us but since it was a holiday weekend, all the rooms were booked. He was able to give us the Strip View, so I guess it was worth it.

There is an adult only pool,  no children allowed, (no, not the clothing optional pool, just an adult only pool)  3 other pools for everyone and the Lazy River pool.  There are plenty of palm trees to be lazy in the shade under by the Lazy River.  The cocktail service is very impressive.  The gals in the casino should take lessons from these gals out in the hot sun, but then again, you pay for the drinks at the pool, not while gambling.  

We haven been to concerts in the Grand Arena here.  They know how to keep the traffic flowing in and out of the arena.  

Rooms have been redone recently and are very nice.  There are numerous types of suites for an upgraded price, or use your casino host to get an upgrade for a more spacious room.  It also helps to be nice to the desk staff.  We happened to score a suite in the east wing this summer.  It's accessed by an obscure door off the casino thru which you gain access with your room key so there is no masses of people fighting for elevators and roaming the halls.

The rooms are pretty standard. We got 2 queen beds. Bathroom was decent, nothing special... but no complaints about the room either. Room had decent space.

Casino floor is pretty big. The MGM has a poker room so my friends like it. Across the street, NYNY does not and they would come to the MGM to play poker when we've stayed at NYNY...

Lots of places to eat here. From fine dining to casual... even your everyday fast food. The food court is pretty good but McDonald's is the only option after about 3am... Long lines. Pass. Tom Collicchio's 'Wichcraft makes good artisanal sandwiches. I had the bacon\/fried egg on ciabatta bread. Good stuff. Only problem with 'Wichcraft is that they're closed by early evening so it's definitely a lunchtime\/daytime type of sandwich place.

First off, MGM reached out to me via email and asked if I wanted to upgrade me room for more money. Thinking it would be awesome, we did it. We were out on the fifth floor with only a view of the casino roof.

I looked for a refrigerator and coffee pot, and saw nothing. I called the front desk and asked if there was a room with the refrigerator and coffee pot. I was told that this was a hotel and motels have refrigerators in the rooms. I was completely turned off by that response and knew I was going to get anywhere.

The bathroom was nothing special at all, probably the worst bathroom I've ever stayed at in Vegas. Maybe I've been lucky, but I've never seen a shower curtain in Vegas hotel room.

The pool area was nice, and the lifeguards and staff were great. However the endless river opens at 10 AM, and closes at 6 PM. If you go to Vegas with kids, for everybody's sake, going to the pool early is the best bet.

We arrived in the morning and check in had a long line.  We requested to have a room near the other two members of our group (who had arrived the night before).  The check-in person was pleasant and said we would receive a phone call around 3 when the room was ready.  No call, so we waited in line again, and got a room on the same floor (20th) at opposite ends.  Would have been nice to have rooms closer together.

Double Q room was nice, clean and good size.  The beds were comfortable and everything in the room worked.  It wasn't excessively noisy, could hear some talking in the hallway, but we did not experience noise like some other reviewers described.  Generally pleased with the room and the housekeeping staff were great!

Our complaints have to do with the costs and fees for everything.  We asked for a bottle opener for wine and they said it would be $1 for the opener and $4.50 to bring it to the room - really?   There was a charge for using the refrigerator in the room, even if you wanted to chill your own bottle of water.   There is no coffee maker in the room, so you either have to order room service or get ready and go down to the cake shoppe or starbucks and wait in long lines.  In addition to that, there is a resort fee charged!!  

I have been to Las Vegas several times and stayed at several of the casino hotels and a couple of the motels, though it has been several years since the last time I was there.  No more of those good deals for flight & hotel, no more good deals for meals.  There are some fabulous restaurants there, but they are expensive.

You'd think they'd at least give free parking to guests.  Most (if not all)  other Vegas casino hotel properties do not charge for parking, as it seems counter intuitive to attract both locals and visitors.  Your first impression upon having to pay to park is a negative experience.  Whomever was the business analyst that came up with this concept should have consulted with their marketing, public relations and customer service departments to discuss the pros (more company revenue and profits) and cons (greedy evil empire stigma) of that decision.

They already force a ""resort fee"" which whether you use those amenities or not, you're charged the fee as a mandatory cost, which is odd in that if that's the case, why don't they just roll that price into the room rate (I know why 'tho, it's for marketing and perception of a lower rate that ends up increasing).

This hotel had a long like of customers trying to get in early for early check in around 1pm, when standard check-in is at 3pm.  The line took an hour to get through.  Part of the problem is when you go up to the desk to check in, the folks at the desk then try to continually ""upsell"" you with upgrades for as little as $20\/night more.  It feels like a bait\/switch hustle of sort.  It's part of the reason why the line was so slow (but then again, I'm sure they're not only trying to increase revenue, but also buying time to let the chambermaids get the rooms ready for occupancy and check in these early arrivals).  

I'm not sure if I like the MGM, I know I don't love it, and I know I can tolerate it (I'd not deny ever staying here again, if the rate was right).  I can recommend it to the degree that if you get a good rate, the rooms are nice enough, not suites (unless you pay for a suite), but worth roughly $100\/night on weekdays, as the ""all in"" total (including resort fees, parking fees, taxes, etc.) if you can get that rate and the peer competitors aren't much higher or lower.

Only downsides:
Valet parking is a bit slow when picking up, especially in the mornings. Plan on 15-20 minutes of waiting after handing in your ticket at the counter to be safe.

West Tower rooms are small and are really best for solo travelers or couples who are going to spend almost no time in the room. My understanding is that this was the original hotel tower from the 1970s (although 100% updated now) and the rest of the complex was built around it.",0,0,0

When we booked, we were getting a promotion deal which included 2 complimentary buffets. We also booked a King room. No one told us if it was a request, or anything like that.

When we go to check in, we are told they only have Queen rooms  available. I said, I booked a King, they told me unless I paid a $30 fee that room size isn't guaranteed. I push a bit, then the lady checks with a manager, and then magically they have a King room available. I think it's a very stupid Hotel Policy of  ""first come, first serve"" when it comes to room size. If all the Kings become booked, then stop booking ppl for king sized rooms, tell them only queens are available. it will solve your issue. 

We were told by the front desk that we just need to charge the buffet to our room # and it will be comp'ed off. We went to go to the buffet, got our ticket, but then decided to take a quick nap. They were closed when they come back. didn't know a buffet in a hotel in vegas would close at 10. Oh well, I was afraid that they wouldn't comp the buffet off (and we didn't even get to use our ticket), so I didn't do the express check out, and waited in line. Good thing I did because they were going to charge me for the buffet! The front desk told me it was a booking error. Stupid.

Check-in was pleasant and my wait was minimal.  Granted I was checking in around 1030 at night, but there were still a good amount of people there checking in.

My room was one of the newly renovated ones, so I was able to see what had been done.  The decor has definitely been updated and the it looks really nice.  The beds were fine, and the wall controlled window shades were great.  I have two nits about the room.  First, there is a AV plug in station for all your gadgets, which is great.  But I kind of wish it were connected to the TV.  That way I could listen to my iPod\/iPhone through the TV speakers.  But, they did have a radio clock that had an adapter to play your iPod on.  Just not great quality of speakers.

The second nit is the counter space in the bathroom.  There was barely any.  But... I also had a wheelchair accessible room, so I am not sure if that is part of the reason due to the extra safety bars on the walls in the bathroom.  So, this may be just the way this particular room is laid out.  But I am girl and travel with an excessive amount of crap and need the room to lay it all out.

The cardio room that comes with the resort fee was not bad.  (FYI... pretty much every hotel in Vegas comes with a resort fee now and it says it everywhere when purchasing online, so I am not sure how people miss this).  It had an adequate amount of ellipticals, treadmills, and bikes, all of which were equipped with TV's.  Not to mention  it was staffed and they were cleaning the equipment in between uses.  In addition, there were snacks and drinks available for purchase.  Not sure if they have one for every set of floors that are divided by elevator banks, but I was able to get right on a machine.

I also paid the $25 to use the Grand Spa facilities and the fitness center one day.  I will review that separately.  

The pool complex is fine.  The one problem I had is I came in the afternoon, and at that point there were towels everywhere.  So you aren't sure if a chair is taken or not.  And more than likely it wasn't .  So I wish they had someone being more vigilant about picking up towels when people leave.  But overall, it was good.

The show and the arena itself were wonderful with  great acoustics, very special, etc.  The hotel is absolutely huge, a very nice and convenient place to stay when attending an event at the aforementioned venue.  We had reserved a West Wing King room, which itself was very nice, conveniently located to everything.

And we notified the wonderful housekeeper, who had been cleaning the room next door to us on the 10th floor.  Everyone was very helpful, and the problem was repaired to our satisfaction....Or so we thought.  As of the next morning, when I took my shower, the tub\/shower drain again drained slowly, although the problem was nowhere near as bad as the day before.

Although I was given a discount for booking the air\/hotel package via Southwest Airlines, I still paid good money, plus resort fees, for the room and both of us found this experience with the plumbing problems to be very disappointing.  We have enjoyed stays at other area hotels, including the Vdara (just over Thanksgiving), as well as at Harrah's and the Golden Nugget downtown, and none of these hotels ever had a plumbing issue like this.  For this reason I would not likely return to MGM Grand for any other occasion, unless I were to attend another concert event at the Grand Garden Arena (which I would like to do).",0,0,0

This was our first time staying here and we were pleasantly surprised! Usually when we come to Vegas we stay at Caesars properties but wanting to try something different I booked through MLife. We got such a great rate on our grand king room. When we checked in I asked if we could have a higher floor and the fd agent was more than accommodating. He got us a room on the 27th floor which was perfect! The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable! We never had any issues with extra charges and they even waived the late check out fee for us!

One of the nice things is  that even though people smoke in the casinos, you don't notice it.  They must have really good ventilation systems.  We checked in around 9pm, and the wait was about 15 minutes, but the line moved along pretty efficiently.  

The hotel room was HUGE.  It was awesome.  The room also had an option of the shade curtain or the dark curtain, which are both controlled by buttons on the wall.  Let me tell you, the dark curtain will completely black out the room and you will sleep for forever.  The bathroom is really large as well, but not too fancy.  The hotel also had wi-fi included with the $25\/DAY resort fee.

The 4 pools and lazy river are pretty awesome, but fill quickly.  And if you go during the summer, there will be children EVERYWHERE, which is really annoying.  They do have 1 tiny adults only pool, but it's the farthest away from the resort.  The lazy river is great, but kind of dirty with leaves, and you have to pay for an inner tube, unless you want to rent a cabana for a ridiculous amount of money.  The prices of the pool drinks and food are ridiculous, however if you walk up to the bar yourself, you instantly get up to $5 off.  Just walk to Fat Tuesday on the 1st level by the parking garage and get a cheaper drink and take it with you.

Since we are both on a bit of a budget we shopped around for the best rates\/promos we could find. It came down to Treasure Island or the MGM. We settled on the MGM because we had not stayed there before and the rates (with promo) were reasonable. Upon check-in, we were asked for our airline ID and informed that the promo was for airline employees only. Now this was never mentioned at any point in the promo or on the MGM website when we booked. The staff informed us that they could not honor the promotion and would have to charge us the regular rates. Needless to say we were shocked. I told them it wasn't our fault that the hotel wasn't able to manage their own promotions. The clerk then proceeded to tell me to calm down or he would call security. At this point I walked away. After several minutes of the manager explaining the situation to my boyfriend, she ""graciously"" offered to honor two nights at the promo rate but told him they would have to charge us full value for the second night, AT A COST OF $450. That's more than the entire trip was supposed to cost. In the end they finally agreed to give us the room at a slightly higher rate than what was booked. And that they had upgraded us to a strip view room (strip view meaning the back of the hotel with a slight view of the corner of the strip) to compensate for the misunderstanding.

With the check-in ordeal out of the way we made our way up to the room. The room was large and clean but slightly outdated. The first thing we noticed was that even though we had a non-smoking room, on a non-smoking floor, it was filled the smell of marijuana coming in from the adjoining room. We had to sleep with a towel at the base of the door just to sleep at night. Yes, we know that Vegas is a party town... but go smoke on the smoking floor.

As for cleanliness, it took housekeeping two days to finally clean our room and bring us fresh towels, after 6 hours of exhausting walking we were shocked to find our room wasn't cleaned by 4pm. Maybe it took a while to clean up the pot room next door. Another shocking find in the room was that the shower would flood the bathroom every time it was used. And by flood I don't mean a little bit of water. The entire floor would be covered with water. We had to use some of our towels to mop up the water.

As for the rest of the hotel, it was nice and clean although quite large and confusing in comparison to some of the others on the strip. We ended up walking in circles trying to get out. 

We are quite disappointed in the way the trip went because Vegas has special meaning for us and we were hoping for a nice getaway. Unfortunately, the MGM saw to it that that was not the case. In the end, we both agree that we will never stay here again.",2,1,0

We always went back b\/c of location, price and the lazy river. The past two visits, however, have permanently turned us off. Both times we had problems at check in (one visit we had to move rooms three times) and this last time they didn't have the type of room we had reserved. The woman helping us had no problem telling us we weren't very important to them b\/c we don't gamble enough. She offered us two ""upgrades"". One was in the Grand, but had two queen beds (we were there on our honeymoon) and the other was in the Signature (which is about a 10 minute walk to the strip). Eventually we were put into a ""nonsmoking"" suite with a king size bed. When we got in, the room absolutely reeked of cigarettes. Didn't see much point is trying to change since it had taken us over an hour to get into that room.

The casino floor was crowded and louder than it normally is. Hard to find a table or machine to play on. We left after two nights and moved to the Venetian. The difference was night and day (but I'll talk about that in my Venetian review!)

We saw KA there (which was fantastic!), but otherwise spend most of our time outside of MGM. I could just say that it was a busy weekend in Vegas and that's why everything was so crowded, but the other casinos weren't bad at all. It seems like MGM had lowered their prices so much that they are over capacity most of the time. That's good for them, I suppose, but not good as one of their guests.

If you're looking for a relatively cheap place to stay and don't care much about service, check out MGM. Unless it's so crowded you can't move, the lazy river is still pretty fun. Otherwise, move on....",0,0,0

Pros:
You can check in at the airport! This is a HUGE pro on a busy day. Bypass the front desk and go right to your room upon arrival. They will call your cell when it is ready if you are too early.
Location is close to everything.
Great pools and lazy river. It's loud on the weekends though. 
Lots of dining options. 
Studio 54 is pretty cool, good crowd, great music.
My impression of the staff is good, they seem to be very friendly and accommodating.
It's not the Ritz-Carlton. Knowing that, you will enjoy this place, even more after the remodel. 
Free wifi (but you pay for it in the resort fee). So that's really a con.

Cons:
The resort fee. It's $22 but includes wifi. Shouldn't have to pay that. 
Don't underestimate how much $8 beer and $15 cocktails can add up!
Go to Walgreens or ABC Stores down the street to stock up.
Rooms are needing a refresh, especially the grand tower rooms. The remodel process has apparently started in Fall '11.
Long walks everywhere. Ask for a room by the elevator. Plan 15-20 min from your room to the conference center.
Cab lines can be long in the evenings, especially during an event.",1,0,1

Two guys had to help the girl out of the pool and she falls, slamming her ribs onto the side of the pool and lands back in the water, again having to be helped\/carried out of the water.   The entire time the female life guard just sits in her chair and somebody finally yells, ""lifeguard, for God's sake do your job and get help"".    

MGM - Step up and be responsible.   If you see somebody is totally intoxicated, refuse to sell them alcohol.  Time to tighten up your security, and hold lifeguards accountable to do their job!

It's this teeny tiny bar that has jello shots, and about 3 years ago my girlfriends and I stumbled across this. I hear a woman's voice booming from the other side of the bar; ""Whadda you ladies want?"" She is abrupt but welcoming, seems very no nonsense, and you feel strangely drawn to her. Then it dawned on me ~ ""Oh my God, you have got to be from Chicago, huh?"" She screams back in that nasal accent, ""Yeah! Hey! Are you girls from Chicago too?"" I fell in love with this woman! She comes over with a TRAY of different colored jello shots like she's selling car stereos. She gives a description of each flavor and the ingredient list, and she speaks of each of them with such passion. I never knew there was a connoisseur of jello shots, until that day. 

So each time I go to Vegas I make a special trip to see Lisa and have one of her famous jello shots. She comes and hugs me each time, and even remembers my name! I feel like I'm at Cheers or something (please keep in mind I only visit Vegas every 3 to 6 months!) 

So I took a special trip to see Lisa last night, and instantly heard her voice when the sliding door opened coming off the foot bridge. I almost started crying, I was so happy to see her! So, 3 jello shots, a beer, and two new friends later, I went on my merry way ....

I can't imagine what rooms some of the other reviewers have stayed in.  We have never had a substandard room. They have several different types of rooms to choose from.  We are frequent visitors so we always get some nice free upgrades and very nice rooms.  We have only stayed in a West Tower room on a couple of occasions. They are small rooms, but extremely modern and contemporary. They have flatscreen tv's as well as a tv built in behind the mirror in the bathroom. We typically get a suite and find them to always be extremely clean and updated and comfortable.  Most of the mattresses in the nicer rooms are Serta Perfect Day units.  These are about 4k mattresses and are very good quality, and most people find them very comfortable. After staying several times we ended up buying one for our home.

The MGM is fairly large, but easy to navigate once you know the layout.  Compared to many other strip properties the walkways are very wide.  The Studio Walk is where some of the fine dining restaurants are located, as well as some of the more casual dining choices.  The array of dining choices is one of the reasons we really enjoy the MGM.  From fine dining to a quick bite or snack there are ample choices.

We have always found the elevators to be very fast, and haven't even noticed the music.  Check in is always fast and efficient, and they offer express in-room checkout, which is nice.  The concierge's have always been very helpful with getting show tickets and making suggestions.

The poker room is very nice, as is the sports book.  The casino is vibrant and clean.  I have never been in any bathroom that wasn't spotlessly clean, even when the property is extremely busy.  All of the staff that we have interacted with have been great.

Kinda wish it was larger but I liked that the blinds hid the sunlight enough when I was trying to sleep in from a late night out on the town. Down bedding - not a good thing. I could feel my skin getting poked by down feathers. Not a large TV, not even a flat screen. Bose radio but wish it was iPod compatible and not just by auxiliary cord.

Late night eats - Wolfgang puck's is open until 6am. Kinda expensive for my liking but the food was awesome. Who knows, you might just find 2 girls passed out at the bar there at 4am and you can hella laugh at them. And McDonalds is open til around 4am if you want something cheaper than a $10 chicken soup.

Overall, not as pretentious as the north-center end of the strip (Wynn-Encore\/Venetian-Palazzo\/Mirage\/TI). Pretty chill. Lots of kids so watch out if they might cramp your style.

I've stopped by Centrifuge and the West Wing bar last time and both are good place to grab a drink.  Centrifuge is a bit hip and filled with some good crowd to chill and drink.  Since I'm not a fan of clubs, this bar was right up my alley.  West Wing bar is more chill and quiet, but since I had some free drink coupons courtesy of MGM, I had to check it out.  Strong drinks, but good at the same thing.

Only complain I guess I have about MGM is that it's not located in the middle of the strip, but when you're in Vegas, you're most likely to walk around anyways right??  Fun times and I'll definitely be back.",2,0,1

Having been to Vegas MANY times, I have stayed at the best, brightest and flashiest hotels on the strip but had never gotten around to MGM - so I decided to give it a try.

As we neared the front desk for check-in I already began to regret this decision. There was a line so long you would think they're giving away the freakin' rooms. After spending 30 min to get only halfway through the line, I remembered the mobile check-in option. I have used this option at many hotels and all I have to do is pick up my key cards from guest services rather than stand in a long line. I guess that's just not how it works at MGM. We were told to wait for 3-4 hours because now that we had registered on the mobile check-in we ""had to wait for a clean room which is not available at this time"". Mind you, it was 8pm at a hotel that guarantees 3pm check-in. Further we were told we can no longer use the regular line. It took another 35 min of unpleasant reasoning with rude staff to get us checked in, which brings me to travesty #2.

ROOM TYPE SOLD OUT. Yes, we made a reservation well in advance but rooms were sold out. Are these people aware of how many rooms they have? Luckily we were ""upgraded"". The upgrade included hall entry through what looks like a broom closet or janitorial staff entryway. We also had been upgraded to a room with a view of generators, dirty stained bathroom fixtures, a broken shower head and the undeniable smell of weed. CLAAAAAASSSSYYYYY. It was also a handicap accessible room with a bench in the tub. 

Parking was luxurious as well. The front desk had failed to inquire about whether we were parking a car in the lot. Consequently, we ended up spending 20 min getting our car out of the parking structure. We were lectures about how valet is a separate entity from self-parking (we had not requested valet) and were treated like it was our fault parking had not been added to our room key.

To round out our glamorous stay, my sister was almost smashed in the parking lot elevator while trying to get me (trapped in the elevator) out. There isn't one thing this hotel did right. For my money, this sad establishment that banks on its past fame is no real option.",2,1,0

We took a shuttle from the airport and were the first hotel stop which was nice. Upon arrival, we waited on the check in line for about 20 minutes but were able to check in early which was nice. We stayed on the 18th floor at the very end of the hallway which was peaceful until the last 2 nights where we had awful guests above us loud and obnoxious starting at 530am and throughout the last day.

The room was okay, I've stayed at better in Atlantic City believe it or not. Bathroom was nice, beds were super comfortable. The charging station provided was very slow to use so we just used our own. We did not even step foot near the mini bar due to the outrageous prices. It would have been nice to have a fridge, we did not want to pay $20+ per night for one. I had no problem with the wifi other than having to sign back in a few times. In comparison, the other hotels were insanely expensive to use wifi. The pool was also nice and even with people there it was enjoyable and you had your own space.

A huge drawback for us were the food options. It's great to have higher end options, but there menus were not at all appealing. We found ourselves crossing over to NYNY for most of our meals. The casino was big and got quite crowded by late afternoon. The smoke wasn't nearly as bad as i expected.

One of my biggest gripes was the noise on the last day and every day and night with the sirens and helicopters. This I expected from Vegas, but still annoying. The cleaning service was also widely inconsistent, we wound up only have our room cleaned twice the entire time and towels were only replaced once.

Overall, it was just alright. For the money paid for one of the nicer hotels I expected more.",0,0,0

 I will say that it is slightly more expensive than the nearby Tropicana, New York New York, and Excalibur but I think it is worth the few extra bucks. The resort is a little self-sustaining city with plenty to do...be careful not to get lost and spend too much time just there.

As we were pulling into the hotel we were surprised to find that there is no car lane for dropping off guests of the hotel. We tried to stop for a moment just so I can hop out of the car and get us checked in but out of no where we were screamed at by the parking attendants to move elsewhere so we did. As soon as we got to the place were instructed to move to, we were being screamed at by the valet parking staff. It was incredibly rude and insulting be yelled at by the staff of the hotel we were about to stay with on our most special time.

Eventually, I walked in to check in and stood in line for about 30 minutes. The check in lady was very nice and explained that the hotel was overbooked and that she is going to upgrade us to a better room, great!

My husband and I go to the airport to return the car, get a taxi and bring ourselves and our bags back. We find our way to the elevator and as we get closer to the room we hear voices coming from that direction and the door was slightly ajar. A child runs out and a mother right after him as we hear ""I'm naked!"" screams coming from within our room. We realized that someone was already staying in that room...

We came down to the lobby and as we are waiting for a manager to come we chatted with the couple that also came down to talk to the manager. They also had a naked person in their room...

The manager finally came to talk to us and was very apologetic and did his best to correct the situation by upgrading us to the ""Stay well"" floor and a very nice suit. This was great until the next day we received a torn towel in our room...

Another thing that was very bothersome was the terrible smoke smell everywhere in the hotel!! It was hard to breath at times.

Overall, the experience sucked and even though the hotel staff did their very best to correct the situation we still left with a very bitter taste in our mouths.

Ok, now that you understand the degree of awfulness, where to begin:

I booked and paid online reservation which includes early check in and late check out (for $60-80 extra) because I knew our plane arrived at noon. We waited in an hour long line to be told that rooms weren't available until 2pm and that she ""couldn't see"" our early check in reservation. We dropped off luggage with bell desk and went to pub for lunch and a drink and to waste the first 2 hours of our vacation. 

At 2pm, I called and was rudely informed that check in time was 3pm actually so I still needed to wait some more.

At 3:05pm, they finally called to give us our room number. If every single room needed to be available by 3pm, why were we the last to get a room if we had already waited for 3 freaking hours!?!?!

We get to room at 3:15 and I call for luggage. Told it will take 5-15 minutes and not to leave the room while we wait for it. After 45 minutes, I call back to be told ""oops, our ticket must not have printed so your luggage is still sitting here. It will right up"". No apology.

Luggage finally arrives around 4:15 (another hour wasted) and the main handle on the large piece of luggage is broken off!! The bell man doesn't mention this but when I see it and ask him he tells me that it was already like that. Um, NO it was NOT.

We have finally had enough and call hotel management. Joey, the customer service rep, tells me that she CAN SEE my early check in and out payments, doesn't know why the front desk lady couldn't. SCREAM!. She then offers to refund the resort fees (about $25\/day) and 2 free breakfast meals (about $50 value). That is clearly not enough to make up this mess but at this point we are just wanting to get down to the pool and start the vacation.

After relaxing and partying for two days, we verify we have late check out so that we can sleep in and catch later flight. We do. Yay! Since we got in about 5am, we needed to sleep past the normal 11am-noon check out. Except apparently the housekeeping staff didn't get this memo, or didn't even bother to check because TWICE that afternoon while we were still trying to sleep, they knocked loudly and entered our room. Yes, entered. The MGM rooms did not have a door lock or deadbolt so without jamming a door under the handle, there is NO way to keep unwanted people from just opening your door and looking inside! They did not apologize, just closed the door and walked off. We tried to go back to sleep. And then they did it a 2nd time. Are you freaking kidding me?!?

We go to check out and guess what has NOT been applied to our bill. The refunds. And the front desk tells me that the offer was for 2 free breakfast buffets, not room service, so she will only credit one of them. Again, at this point, I was so ready to get out of there that I didn't care. 

I will NEVER EVER stay at MGM again and recommend you don't either.",17,1,1

Honestly, it's one of the best properties on the strip.  It mixes more casual fare like buffets and chain restaurants with ultra high end fare like Joel Robuchon.  The largest and hottest nightclub in Las Vegas, Hakkasan, is here as well.  You can pair that up with Wet Republic in the day time .... One of the hottest pools.

And, of course, there's the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where major fight nights and concerts get held on a regular basis.

There really is something for everyone here.

If there's one thing missing, it's quality shopping like you can get at Crystals or the Forum Shops.  Luckily, the location of the MGM Grand is also quite good ... It's on a very central area of the strip, which makes it about as easy as it can be in Vegas to hop over to other properties.

If you are looking for an entirely upscale experience, then this might not be the place for you.  WynnCore might be more up your alley.  But there are some undisputed bests here (like Robuchon and Hakkasan) and, you know what?  Sometimes I want to eat Chicken McNuggets and not have to walk 30 min to another casino to do it.

Eating:  If you are into restaurants by top chefs this place is for you.  There is also a food court, but like any restaurant in a casino, the prices are high.  Ate at the buffet and was disappointed.  Selection was basic at best, although it did have crab legs and prime rib.  Based on other buffets\/price I would look to either the bellagio or the mirage.  I am glad that when I booked the room 2 complimentary buffets were included and didn't have to pay for a buffet equivalent to Old Country Buffet.

-MGM Garden Arena
-Ka by Cirque du Soleil
-Hakkasan- club that always has a huge line, and pulls in big name DJ's like Calvin Harris(who I have actually heard of)

Great restaurants, including where I dined Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, which is fantastic.

""First thing first Go for the Grand Tower""

  I actually came back from the Vegas today on June 7  ,2010 and stayed here  at the M.G.M Grand  Casino and Hotel over the weekend. This was a last minute trip and went with the best price hotel that I thought  that it would be nice in a certain price range. First of all the self parking lot is a pain to me not that well thought out many  part's are closed off to vehicular traffic.After finding a parking spot you will then have to navigate thru a miniature Hollywood theme mall to either get to the Escalator or either the elevator that will take you to the out side of the building. Check in was slow arriving around 4 p.m but was understandable and the associate Ann was nice and set me up in a nice room.

 My room was located on the 15th floor in the Grand tower with a view of Caesar Palace, Planet Hollywood, City Center and Monte Carlo. Over all a nice,clean and spacious room with a king size bed ,desk ,couch, full tub and shower  and two chair's. No Hd tv but hey it's Vegas will you really be in your room watching tv?

  The Casino was nice big and clean and the perfume air that is let out of the vent's eliminate sent  or smoking thru out the hotel. The hotel casino offered a variety of food from Asian inspired to Mc Donald's and Starbucks which where all pricey. The pool area had a lot to offer and space but is very crowded so get there early especially on the 100 degree days.

  Last but not least Wet republic  lets see kinda overrated and It didn't grab me but it was $50 even If you were a guest.(MGM is trying to get every penny ).Also you need to have swim wear or they have to like you because it was mixed from people entering and we were denied because we had tennis shoes while others got away with it with even chuck Taylor on.

  Last and not least Studio 54 ............. pure Garbage unless you like old old hip hop and  old techno.DJ Skribble  disappointing to me, $30 cover way too much should be $5 or actually fee. Cramp dance floor , small bar's just not worth it.

 Overall nice casino, hotel room was nice but get the grand tower not the west wing(thank me later). Wont compare to Aria , Caesar Palace, Mandalay bay but other wise a very nice hotel for the right price. I would stay here again.",4,0,0

I'm sure there are certain aspects of other hotels and casinos that are better, but MGM is my go-to whenever I'm in Vegas. On this most recent trip, we were able to book an Executive King Suite. The room was large and had a fantastic bathroom with double sinks, a tub and separate shower. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. One of my favorite things about the MGM is the smell in the hallways. I wish I could have a bottle of whatever they pump through the vents for my own house!

The casino floor was fun as usual. There are plenty of slots to choose from and the smoke smell wasn't too bad. We had a couple of meals at Stage Deli, as it's a quick and fairly inexpensive breakfast option if you just grab bagels. We also ate in the food court which has options like McDonalds, Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs and a pizza place. Again, fast options, but kind of expensive for what you get.

The best part of MGM is the pool complex. I love grabbing a bucket of beer (or two) and floating the day away in the lazy river. We were lucky enough to have a few days of sunshine and high 80s temperatures to enjoy.

I can't wait for my next Vegas trip and another stay at MGM. We spent our last two days at Planet Hollywood because we extended our trip and it just didn't stack up. I plan on sticking with what works in the future!",0,0,1

The bathroom is a little fancier than usual but besides an extra painting on the wall of the room, it's pretty much the same thing as any cheap hotel in Vegas, except, you know, MGM isn't that cheap.

Ok, will do next time I am booking at a different resort chain that doesn't charge me to park my car! On to the room...When did they switch out the beds for giant bricks?!

Came to town for a bachelor party in late August. I frequent Vegas at least twice a year, but until recently was a Total Rewards guy. Their program went downhill and they screwed me out of being rated on my table play, so I decided to give Mlife a shot, and what better place to begin than the MGM?

Thanks to the Mlife Mastercard, checking in was a breeze. Bypassed the atrocious check in line for express check in, where I was greeted by Marni. (If she hasn't gotten a raise by now, it should be a criminal offense). Mentioning that it was my first time with Mlife, she immediately got me checked in, despite being a few hours early. Complimentary fridge? Sure. Move the groom and best man up to my floor? No problem. Honestly, a lot of front desk employees at Strip casinos frequently seem harried and rushed. Not so with Marni. Took the time and effort to check in periodically to make sure our stay was a pleasant one, and it was, thanks in no small part to her.

I stayed in a tower spa suite on the 20th floor, and I'm sure I had one of the few decent views from MGM that doesn't cost $800 a night. The room was good, spacious and clean. Housekeeping did an excellent job. The ""spa"" tub was excellent as well, made a little disappointing only in the weird gurgling noise that could be heard even from the room as it drained. A minor detail, but one that should probably be addressed.

My only gripe came when it was time to checkout. I had paid for late checkout with my reservation, booked months in advance, and when I called the reservation line I was told it was 3 pm. Lol and behold, I had my door loudly knocked on at 11 am by housekeeping, telling me I had to leave immediately or I would be charged another day. Turns out late checkout is actually at 1 pm. Not 3 pm as the phone operator assured me. Again, a minor detail, but housekeeping not being in sync with room details and waking me up when I had gotten into bed 5 hours prior sucked. 

I would have knocked this review down to 3 stars for waking a guy up like that, but the pristine service provided by Marni kept it at a solid 4. All in all, the MGM provides great service, a city's worth of things to do, and fantastic food (looking at you, Craftsteak!)

Check in was easy and they also have an M-rewards card that gives you points for spending money within the hotel that you can use towards purchases. I think this is a great hotel if you're only staying with adults. There isn't really anything for kids, if you have any. There's a food court with McDonald's, Pan Asian, and other types of foods if you're on a budget or need a late night snack, but they also have Craft Steak, Emeril's, Hecho, and other nicer restaurants in case you wanted a romantic or higher end dinner. They have 3 shows, David Copperfield, Ka, and Jabbowockees. We saw Ka and Jabbowockees (both amazing) so we saw the David Copperfield show, which was one of the greatest illusionist shows I've ever seen. Plenty of places to gamble and nice interior, lots of bars, and great service. Our room was gorgeous, with a view of the strip. We didn't get to use the pool (it was closed in November when we went), but their Signature Towers hotel that's associated with M-life hotels had one open that we visited for an afternoon. The only drawback was the last day when cigarette smoke was coming into the ventilation that we told the front desk about to ensure we didn't get charged and that they could fix.

Our room was nice & spacious.  Upon our first arrival to our room, we noticed that our bedding was clean & comfy but the white sheets had old blood stains.   We called room service to replace our sheets.  The sheets were replaced later at the time when the cleaning crew was scheduled to clean our room.

On day two, our room wasn't cleaned.  We called room service & again they forgot about us.  We had to call for status several times.   Finally, by 10 pmish, our replacement towels were brought in. 
The room was cleaned on the following day at their scheduled cleaning time.

Our bathroom had really poor water pressure in the sink and in the shower.  The pipe holding the shower head was coming undone --off the wall.   The sink water stopper was broken.

There was a $25 daily fee to store items in our room's refrigerator.  

The waterpark is very nice with five pools, a lazy river, waterfalls, plenty of drink bars & food concessions.   Unfortunately,  the lazy river gets crowded & many people are not considerate of their surroundings & bump into one another a lot.   The on site lifeguards did nothing to help mediate the lazy river crowding situation.

The waterpark restrooms are not easily accessible & the women's restrooms were dark inside and stinky.

The hotel & casino is grand with a lot of shops, Starbucks on almost every corner & a lot of choices to eat & drink.

My husband enjoyed the blackjack tables & the dealers were great.

For a fee, we had the opportunity to meet baseball legend Pete Rose at the MGM's sports memorabilia shop & he signed our commemorative baseball bat.

Overall, we made the best of our stay here.  Our room had awesome views & our kids enjoyed the waterpark.

However, based on our experience,  we wouldn't consider staying here again.",7,0,2

I've stayed in Cosmo and Encore previously and both blow MGM out of the water. I seriously should've saved my money and stayed at the airport Travelodge. 

The casino smells like a weird combo of smoke (standard) and The Victoria's Secret Vanilla Lace scent that all 7th graders used in 2002 (kinda weird\/gave me painful pubescent flashbacks). 

Our room on the first floor of the West Wing was like a dungeon. Tiny, gray, and dingy with low ceilings. The one window in the room looked out into a barren area between buildings, with a single cactus growing. The view was so bad that it actually became a joke on our trip. The lighting was dim and cheap-- it was impossible for 2 girls to get ready comfortably. The bathroom area has no door so have fun getting extra comfortable with your roommate's bodily functions. There are doors to the toilet and shower area, but they don't go from floor to ceiling and they slam shut every time. 

No robes.
No iPod dock. 
Crappy toiletries that you won't want to take home 
Tiny and fuzzy TV screen in the bathroom mirror-- try again MGM
Heard absolutely everything in the halls like there wasn't a wall

There was absolutely nothing luxurious about this hotel, and my friend and I paid more for it than any other hotel we've stayed at in Vegas. There are Best Westerns in Minnesota with more modern fixtures.

My boyfriend discovered that the toilet did not work whatsoever. Something was stuck in it. When he took off the lid, he discovered a chilled can of beer resting inside!

When we called for maintenance, they suggested to get another room, explaining that ""whatever is in the toilet is REALLY stuck in there.""

I had been starving for hours and felt like crap. So we had to stand in the line again, and told the lady at the front desk what happened. She moved us to another room and we asked if we could be compensated. She did give us each one free buffet meal worth $60.

After our visit is over though and I've had time to ponder the full gamut of errors, I almost have difficulty with two stars.

Check in was fabulous! We waited in a very long line and it took quite awhile but the gal that checked us in was so funny and kind that we totally forgot the wait and just enjoyed her company.  The room was beautifully furnished and clean with a great view. Room service was timely and the food was delivered piping hot.  And yeah... that's about it! So when you think about it, those are all things that are to be expected when you're checking into a place like the MGM Grand.

Here's the two star review:  Just as I sit down to enjoy my room service meal, I hear dripping. I investigate and find the ceiling is leaking in three different places. Within minutes it really starts pouring in! I try to call the front desk and housekeeping and maintenance and one other button only to be put on hold!  For quite awhile!  Eugene, the maintenance man, was a God send! He helped me move rooms and made me call room service back to get a replacement meal since mine was getting wet by the fourth leak! Mind you my meal was already ""free"" due to comps received during check in, they kindly told me they would comp my meal for all my troubles!  Gee, how kind and generous of them after me having to move rooms in my jammies!  Oh, and they comped the $45 upgrade fee for the one night!  Again, gee, how kind and generous!

During this fiasco, my husband was at the UFC fights and had his own tale of MGM failures! He paid $750 for a seat that they failed to install! Yep, no seat!  Now, Bob was great and friendly and apologetic but basically, they couldn't do much because it was a sold out event. So they thought moving him from chair to chair was a good fix! They put him in a great seat on the floor but when whoever the seat belonged to would show up he'd have to move. No other solution or compensation was offered.

Basically, in my mind, a place like the MGM Grand should be five stars in all areas. I have certain expectations when I stay at a place like the MGM Grand and pay the price for a suite. To have to move rooms at 9:30 at night, by myself, have my meal interrupted and my husband to not have a seat when paying $750 for one, and only be comped $45, is outrageous. 

MGM Grand obviously does not care about loyalty and customer satisfaction. We'll be back for UFC events but we definitely will not be staying at the MGM Grand.",2,1,0

But the biggest issue was this: we had two rooms booked and both cardholders had mysterious ~$5 charges on our cards due to ""drink orders"".  However, none of us ordered drinks thru our room.  They reversed the charges AFTER we waited 45 minutes in line to get to the checkout desk and all they said was, ""we'll remove it for you.""

Honestly, of all the casino-hotels that I've stayed in, MGM is at the top so far (although I will be staying at the Venetian and Mandalay Bay later this year...so we'll see how it compares).  My standards are different than other people's since I'm NOT there do get wasted and go crazy at clubs.  I'm always there for work.

Here are the pros for MGM:
1) The elevators to the Grand\/West towers are RIGHT by the lobby check-in.  There is nothing I hate more than dragging my suitcase through the casino for 10 minutes, or having to walk through the casino every time I want to leave the hotel.  It was really nice that the elevators were convenient and quick to get to.
2) The casino didn't seem as smokey as other casinos, such as Caesars or the Mirage.  My eyes didn't get irritated in the walk from my room to the conference area, which was nice. 
3) There is a good mix of restaurants -- cheap places to eat like McDonalds (where I'd get my morning coffee for cheap) and really expensive restaurants like Shibuya sushi or Knob Hill.
4) My room was QUIET!  Normally I'm woken up once a night while staying in Vegas -- either by outside noise, noise from the room next door, or from the hallway.  I wasn't woken up even once during my 4 nights\/5 days at the MGM.  Be aware, the rooms are basic if you're staying in the Grand Tower.  (But black-out blinds are the best.)
5) The resort rate includes the use of the 4th floor cardio room.  If you stay at Caesar's, it's $25 PER DAY to use their fitness center, which is the only place you can exercise.  The cardio room is VERY VERY SMALL for the size of the hotel, however--just 12 or so machines.  Luckily, I had free access to the spa fitness center thanks to the conference I was attending.
6) I was able to get a 1pm late checkout and the folks at the check-in area were very nice.

Cons:
1) If you're there for a conference, the conference area + ballroom is pretty far away from the Grand tower hotel rooms.  You walk through the casino, through The District (the area of restaurants\/shops), down an escalator, through a hallway (past the outdoor pool area), and then outside and to the ballroom which is a separate building.  It's a little odd, but luckily the weather was nice and didn't affect our walks outside.  
2) The District area closes pretty early by Vegas standards.  I really wanted froyo one evening after a business dinner, and they were closed!  It was kind of a bummer for someone like me who doesn't get wasted and gamble a ton in Vegas.
3) My bed was squeaky, which would only have been really annoying if my boyfriend had come with me on the trip.  :-)",4,3,0

The MGM is a pretty great place to stay - always clean with a great casino and decent cafe.  Our shower broke this past time around (constantly flowing, almost OVERflowing) and we placed a call to maintenance.  They were there in about 20 minutes and fixed our problem in about 10.  Pretty efficient, and nice to boot.

The rooms are perfect for 4, but pretty packed at 6 (tried both scenarios).  The pool is a reason to stay here alone - the lazy river just doesn't get old.  It doesn't really matter how hot it is (try 109 this past weekend), the lazy river is a perfect way to cool down.  The other pools kinda suck, but it's okay.  The River will never fail you.

BUT DO NOTE:  If you're checking out at 11 (especially on a Sunday) TRY TRY TRY to leave earlier.  There will be a line and you'll end up on an elevator going up just so you can go down.  It took us about 15 minutes to get on an elevator and I'm pretty positive that wasn't a bad wait compared to some.

The MGM Grand is a sprawling behemoth whose 5,000 hotel rooms feature atrocious, inconsistent cleaning service, weak shower pressure, worn furniture, anemic sound proofing, and paltry amenities (most rooms do not even have refrigerators). But, the room service is reasonably priced and remarkably prompt, with food that is better seasoned than expected (the chicken quesadillas are redolent of cinnamon, cocoa, and ground peppers). And, the fainting couches in the rooms are nicely situated and comfortable, while the pools are irresistible. However, there is nothing special about a stay at the MGM except the plethora of excessively expensive restaurants and the moody black and white photos of classic Hollywood stars who stare eerily at you in the middle of the night. And, while saying that you're sweet, the front desk will blame you because you checked into a rumpled, uncleaned room that still isn't clean later that evening.

I am writing this review not for the hotel overall, which I am satisfied with (it is clean, modern, great location), but for the customer service resolution.

It was a rough weekend to say the least. A friend lost her purse on the first night. She used the hotel phone to call her family to recover money, etc (a lot more than I knew about). She could not participate in 'Vegas' activities without an ID. We were not told that calling out of the Vegas area code would result in long distance charges. My card happened to be on the room for deposit. I checked out over the phone and was not notified of any charges until I specifically asked. I found out they automatically charged ~$500 in fees for the calls, which I would not have known had I not asked. I was incredibly mad to say the least. Even if my friend had not lost all of her money, paying me back $500 for phone calls is ridiculous.

I went down to the customer service desk and spoke to a wonderful agent (I think named Melissa). I explained the entire situation, that I was charged for calls I didn't make. That those calls were made because my friend lost everything. That we did not know to avoid the calls because we were not told about the fee. She empathized with me and told me that she was going to take all of the charges off. She also assured me that my deposit would come off of my card. I was so relieved and grateful and practically moved to tears with he kindness.

I followed up on my bank account and did not notice any of the charges refunded. I called MGM Grand and they assured me they would look into it. The following day instead of refunding the fee charges they were taken out again. At that point I was charged $500 twice and the deposit was still withdrawn. It was ridiculous and frustrating. I called back again and was told that the situation would be resolved. At this point I lost hope. Finally, a week later they removed the double charge and the deposit from my card.

I appreciate MGM Grand for being responsive and understanding over the phone, for owning their mistake and following through with a solution.

I also have a friend who works in Vegas hospitality and managed to finagle an upgrade for husband and me to a 26th floor, Strip-view, ""Celebrity Spa"" suite which was enormous, nicely appointed, had a fantastic whirlpool tub b-room and perfectly comfortable bed, and a night view that dazzled like a fully lit Christmas tree.  So again, I'm not gonna complain about the room.  As others have mentioned, water pressure might be better, shower head a little higher, and the furniture could use some sprucing.  All in all just fine, tho.

The casino itself, however, is one of the more uninspired on the Strip and finding your way around is like getting dropped off in the Sierras without a topo map and being told to orienteer your way out.  Ridiculously and unnecessarily confusing.  And check-in is a gigantic, frustratingly long cluster.   I find MGM's casino a bit boring and ""low key"" for the Strip, too -- if your theme is Hollywood, let's play it up a bit shall we?  I don't think anyone visiting Vegas is going to poo-poo an over-the-top, themed casino.  I will say the lion habitat is entertaining, though I always worry about quality of life for caged animals.  I was much relieved to learn that many different lions are rotated in and out on a regular basis, so they're never in the enclosure longer than 5 hours daily, aren't there every day, and live on a free-range ranch outside the city when they're not at MGM.

Dealers and croupiers (for the most part) are great here, though.  Funny, charming, and personable well-oiled machines throwing out cards and spinning roulette wheels with panache.",8,5,8

I saw room pictures online, so I knew they newly remodelled the rooms and they looked nice:  Modern with clean lines.  I booked the room through Priceline and stayed during the last week of Dec.  For $87\/night & getting a $75 dining credit, I was very satisfied.  Sure, there's newer, swankier hotels, but I stayed here because the price was good & I knew it would be like new due to the recent remodeling of the rooms.

My boyfriend and I stayed in the Grand King room on the 27th floor and it's definitely roomy enough for two people.  The bed was nice and your head really sinks into the pillow.  They have 37' or 42' inch flat screen Samsung TVs.  The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom had great chrome fixtures.  They sure do have very, very hot water, which is good.

I saw the Cirque du Solilel KA show here and it was fabulous!  The theatre is quite huge.  I ate at the MGM Grand buffet one night and it was nice and no wait.  We were there at about 9:20pm.

Check-in was a bit of a wait since I was there very close to the 3pm check-in time, but check-out was much quicker since I was there about 2 hours before the 11am check-out time.  The procedures themselves were simple.  I was asked if I wanted a lower or higher floor.  The view from the room was OK.  We faced the back of the strip, but that's alright.

(We stayed in the main tower on the 9th floor)  The rooms have nothing to wow you, but they're mostly clean and quiet. Unlike many reviews I read, the elevators were seriously some of the fastest elevators I've ever used.  WAAAY faster then the place I work or any apartment building I've ever lived in.

There's a bunch of celebrity chef restaurants as well as the standard Cirque du Soleil show.  We tried a few places in the casino, but my personal favorite was Diego's in the Studio Walk.

The casino itself is safe, open and clean with only the occasional stinky smoker cloud hanging about.  The cocktail waitresses are few and far between, so drinks at the slots come SLOW.  Don't expect to be catered to even when leaving a good tip, they've just got too much ground to cover.

The room rates are a bit more reasonable then some other spots on the strip.  Check in was a breeze and all the staff I dealt with were great.

Negatives: the rooms are all marked sell-by 1989. 

The television is a big honkin tube with about five worthwhile channels and an unexplained assortment of Asian-language selections. The furniture is fine, but is certainly late 1980's. There are some shoddy linens here and there, our bedspread had what looked like pizza stains on the outside and our sheets were shredded up in one part.  Also noticed some crust on a few towels.  To me, it looked like someone left gunks of self-tanner on a sheet that didn't come out in the wash (so I wouldn't expect that to be common).

Our shower head was busted up and it wouldn't work without also dumping a bathtub full of water into the tub at the same time. The main light in the bathroom was out and the second light periodically failed to work.  We called the front desk and it was fixed very quickly while we went to dinner.  

After staying in a total dump (the Imperial Palace), I can appreciate a quiet and clean hotel, but for the money I'd really want a bit more luxury.

It was the prize of the 90's that has withstood the test of time and the slew of newer more high-end casino's that have popped up around it. As dingy as the lions look and how not attractive it looks from the outside it's a world class casino even at its age and that it's out of its glory days. How many countless prize fights were held there?, when the heavyweights ruled the world. I can't even name the buffet or the club that is there, and yes it's been a while since I've stayed there. The floorplan is what keeps it from looking too dated, but the rooms were so cutting edge back then they aren't nearly as bad as NYNY today. Some minor upgrades are what makes this more of the Stratosphere of the south strip. There were no games or tables that I can remember as if I wanted to come check out next time.

I booked the room through the YSB link on the Las Vegas Elite Events page which was triply convenient: Yelp had secured a group rate, booking with the link guaranteed YEE admission & MGM was only a short walk from the 1st YSB YEE.

In addition to all the the Yelp-y convenience, the MGM Grand was an overall nice to place to stay on the Strip for a few days. The highlights were the room & all the amenities available in & around this vast & cavernous building. The not-so-greats were the resort fee & a labyrinthine layout seemingly designed to make exits hard to find.

Our room had smart, modern decor, flat-panel TV & was spotlessly clean. Lowering the blackout shade over the wall-to-wall window could turn the room totally pitch black in the middle of the blazing bright day, which was much appreciated since we were keeping vampires' hours. The bed was comfortable enough to induce coma.

There were miscues to the room, however. There was no coffee maker or microwave or mini-fridge in the room. There was a refrigerated mini-bar in the room, but don't touch anything inside of it unless you want to pay for it. That also goes for just moving stuff around in there. Apparently, MGM will charge some kind of $ fine to your hotel bill if you move the contents of the mini-bar to refrigerate your own stuff.

As far as amenities go, the sprawling MGM Grand property has: nearly 2 dozen eateries, bars & clubs, cardio room, a gigantic multi-level parking garage, a monorail station, the Grand Pool, the Grand Garden Arena & of course, the huge gaming areas of the casino. I don't gamble at all, so no comment on that last feature. The Grand Pool is cool, definitely worth checking out during any stay here.

All of this stuff on premises contributes to the aforementioned labyrinthine layout. There are no signs anywhere with directions to any exit. Even on our 3rd day there, the girlfriend & I were finding new, unplanned & unintended ways to get from our room to outside of the building & vice versa. I guess it's not in the best interest of MGM's profits to make it easy to leave.

Then there's the resort fee. A minor complaint, really. It's $25\/ day for parking, Wi-Fi in the room & use of the cardio room + access to the Grand Pool could be considered something ""resort."" I got a good enough basic rate on the room that an added $25 was still a good deal for the level of the amenities. Just be aware when booking here that what you really pay is the room rate + the resort fee.

The MGM Grand was home away from home for the girlfriend & I during Yelp Spring Break. Using the Yelp arranged group rate, it was a comfortable & convenient home away from home for not a whole lot of $. Thank you MGM Grand & Yelp for the hospitality.",4,2,1

MGM was my choice as I'd stayed their in the past and love the amenities. When I got here I upgraded my room to the ""strip view"" (Biggest waste of money ever). As I've stayed at the Cosmopolitan before I had a different expectation of what strip view was. Needless to say I get a nice view of the highway and some buildings woo! (Not worth an extra $35\/night).

Anyways I sucked up the room, didn't want to complain as well I opt'ed in for it. Just like eating at a restaurant if you eat all your food it's too late to tell them you didn't enjoy it.

July 18 is where the trip went from good to not so good. I had a TD Bank envelope with about $400 sitting in my room which was STOLEN. (didn't know there was a safe in here til I spoke to security, it's apparently in a drawer). Now I know the maids leave the door open when they clean our room so this may have led to the theft or they themselves decided to help themselves to my money but somehow the money had gone missing.

In an attempt to speak with security I was told in a nice way that there wasn't much that they could do and that I would have to file a police report. I went ahead and filled out a police report however after reading the reviews of many other people I'd say it's a lost cause.

The frustrating part is not the loss of the money but it's the response by the hotel, although friendly the nonchalant there is nothing we can do attitude is one that is frustrating. 

Two Important Notes:

1) Don't upgrade to their strip view in the ""Grand Tower"". Save your money and see the pictures below, you'll get a nice view of some buildings thats about it.

2) Look for the safe, and if there isn't request one. If all else fails hide your money but don't leave it lying out. Learn from my experience this happened on the last day of my trip and it's only $400 but it's still money and when staying in a hotel your stuff should be safe.

The sad part is it ruined the trip for my girlfriend. She doesn't even feel comfortable leaving our stuff in the room now because of this situation.",0,0,0

Though this is only a guess, I believe that MGM staggers its penthouse assignments for as long as it can. That way you don't have people to the left and right or on top of each other until it's absolutely necessary. Regardless, whatever MGM is doing, I hope it continues. And this tip: when you get a penthouse suite, try to get a corner. Makes the experience even better. 

As for the rooms, they are spacious and nice. The amenities, accessories, etc., of the room, though, do not live up to what I expect from a true penthouse suite. The place that does have accessories and amenities that are penthouse quality is the Aria hotel. Top notch.

Anyhow, if you're looking for a very nice penthouse to stay in, be sure to check out the MGM.

The deposit is refunded at the end of your stay if you don't ruin the room you stayed in. They have mobile check in and it's faster than waiting in the regular line. I also went to the wet republic pool and it was amazing. The tickets were cheap as well. I also went to the regular pool to get a tan.

Check-In:
I was definitely disappointed in my stay. Check in took forever. Guest services advised this wasn't normal; however, with now reading other customers comments, I see this is a common theme. We were definitely in line over 30 minutes after a very long commute. 

The room:
We were moved to a king bed room, in the Grand Tower, it wasn't far from the lobby. It was very dim in the room, terrible visibility, so at first glance it looked fine. The next morning, it was pretty apparent that the room wasn't well taken care of. The bathroom door was broken, the shower knob was extremely temperamental (scolding hot or cold). There was a patched hole in the wall, the toilet paper holder was broken. Several areas of the room weren't clean (the desk, the bathroom vanity, stuff was missing from the mini bar).

The Bed:
There were stains on the decor pillow placed in the middle of my bed. Stains all over the mattress itself including a very large yellow stain right smack dab in the middle of the bed under this mattress protector they had on top of the mattress covering it up. I was mortified after seeing that, I couldn't believe I slept a night in the bed. 

Service:
I asked for house keeping to resolve the mattress issue, while we were at a convention, we got back 10 hours later, House keeping had came in attempted to clean the visible stains on the edges of the mattress and remade the bed (putting the nasty decor pillow right back on top). I had been assured that it would have be taken care of that someone would call my cell phone since I was at a convention. No one called me, they called my hotel room and left a message. I had to end up calling 3-4 times to get the mattress removed. Guest services didn't seem to care and stated it was a house keeping concern. She also said there were no notes indicating House keeping was going to try and clean the mattress, and that I was mistaken. When we checked to see if maybe they flipped the mattress,since the original stains we saw were gone, that's when we encountered the huge stain on the middle of the bed. It took house keeping another 30 minutes from the last call to replace the bed. 

Casino:
Was very outdated, looked old and dirty. During our stay we walked around quite a bit and the MGM was not grand in comparison to the other nearby hotels. If I had to do it all over again, I would definitely not stay there. 

Pros:
The ladies at the concierge desk were super nice and welcoming. 
The location, is within walking distance of everything including the monorail.

I did get annoyed of the green light. But it wasn't a big deal. i think I got use to it after the second night we stayed...

Asked 4 security guards where the north tower was, it was only the last guard who actually knew where the tower was. How do your guards not know where the tower is?!

There were even rooms on the 1st floor. We got to our room which was decent. Pretty small, but was decorated and taken pretty well care of. We opened the blinds to see our view and our ""view"" was ventilation systems and extra tables that they probably use for their venues. We never opened our blinds again as there was literally nothing to look at. After coming back to our room on Saturday, we noticed a heap of gum stuck to the top of one of our beds - which was not there before we left (the maids had come and cleaned up).

The room itself was good, but the airconditioning vent was small and not strong enough.  There was some long black slab on the window you slide to let the air in.  And ifcourse, there was no refrigerator nor microwave... major bummer.

The casino is smoke filled; I guess America's smokers converged on MGM for a last puff as youngsters have turned to vaping.  I prefer a non-smoking casino so I could keep the Angel of Death from me for 50 years.

MGM seemed like it wants to be all things to all people; clubers, families, oldsters, sports fans, gamers, etc.  Add to that the fancy restaurants like Hakkasan, which is strictly for white yuppies and girls in high heels, black dresses with half their breasts exposed...  which I am hoping will be gone by next year. 

Oh, and their lion habitat is gone.  I guess free shows are too much for Vegas these days as they are moving away from family entertainment and back to gambling and adult themes not friendly for kids.  That is why the Brazil shows in Rio and TI's pirate shows are gone as well.

Their buffet voucher system was confusing.  We used it for dinner, and then we had bathroom time for some 2 hours to expel the horrible food.  Thankfuly, I came well stocked with Alka-Seltzer.  However, MGM's breakfast buffet was good.

- no iHome, or something you can plug your blackberry\/ipod into via an auxillary cord
- no mirror outside the bathroom

+ simple yet not bland decor
+ being guests wet republic was free...
- wet republic was kinda weak, especially the hot pool

The casino has that typical fun Vegas feel and I enjoyed playing some video roulette.  I'm not much of a gambler, but I do a little for fun sometimes and made a whopping $8 by the end of this trip.  Woo hoo!

My room was nice, there are good restaurants, fun bars, entertainment, shopping, etc. and most folks seemed to be enjoying themselves.

However, I was not there on vacation or a getaway.  I was there on business, attending a convention at the hotel, so while I can write about what enjoyed about the trip, this is only a 3 star review because of one negative that put a downer on the convention for many of us attendees who were also staying at the hotel.  The convention areas is simply too far from all of the rooms.

It may seem petty to someone who has not been to a convention at a hotel before; but there can be a lot of walking and you usually have things to carry, be it a briefcase or maybe much more if you are an exhibitor or speaker.

There are a lot of rooms, many floors and long hallways.  Once you leave the area where your room is located and get into the public area, you will have to trek through the casino, the mall (including the food court), downstairs into another long hallway for another long walk to the convention area.  How much longer the walk is will then depend on which floor(s) and which hall(s) the event you are attending is located.

One or 2 long walks like this might not be so bad, but having to make multiple walks like this back and forth to your room, other parts of the hotel, the strip, etc. is just too much and can also cost you time at your event.

The hotel has a great pool area, but it is located on the outside of that last long hallway I mentioned, which means people were having to make most of the same walk I just described, through the casino, mall, etc., just to get between their rooms and the pool.

This a great and classic Vegas hotel that I plan to visit and maybe even stay at again sometime, but I hope I never get stuck at another convention there and I understand that the convention host got enough similar complaints from the other attendees that this particular event is not likely to be held there again.",0,0,0

My friend and I were being upgraded for free so I was happy. Until, we fount the North Tower. The moment we walked in it had a horrible smell, since we were on the first floor and only the second room from the entrance, it was smelly when we opened our doors as well. First night, we discovered our air conditioner wasn't working, but it magically started working the next day. The next morning, I realized our shower was clogged, called for maintenance to fix it, maintenance came and claimed they fixed it-- my next shower was less clogged but water still pooled up my leg. Ppl are allowed to smoke in the casino, so you will smell like smoke just walking throughout the casino to get where you're are going. Now on to the positive, the pool!! Mgm has 5 pools which includes a lazy river and 3 jacuzzis. Which is the ONLY reason they get 3 stars. I would probably book here again just for the pools. Just a heads up, unless you have your own tube, it's going to cost you $26 to buy one. There are several bars in the pool area as well, delicious drinks as well. They have some great, although a lil pricey, restaurants. I would recommend you avoid the food court with Jonny rockets, pizza, etc unless you're on a real low budget because your tastebuds and stomach will hate you.

 I'll do this by bullet points:
- The wait to check in on Saturday was unreal. They had three large crystal water dispensers on line...guess waiting for a room here is expected.

- Once at the desk, we had to split our rooms because my mom is a smoker and I am not. I ordered two rooms the way I wanted, but he said that ""These online reservation places do that"" (yes he's talking about Orbitz or any others he can toss under the bus). So we had 2 non-smoking rooms. He told me that the smoking rooms were in another tower....and were $25 more. Bait and switch and he threw it at Orbitz' feet!

- The walk to our room was about a mile or so. No, I'm not kidding. We were in the West tower at THE END of the hallway. See what happens when you are not happy at the front desk?

- Distance from events to restaurants to casino....amazing. As he said at the front desk, ""We are the largest hotel in the Western United States"". Don't care about trivia facts that make my stay worse.

- We ate at an overpriced restaurant after the show we attended. Great food, great service, but very pricey unless you are getting main course food. $18 lobster bisque soup...ouch.

Overall, if this place truly cared about me, they would have been responsive. When I complained about things at the front, they would have made it right. I even said we were not going to spend our gaming dollars at this place, and he acted as if he did not hear me. Guess he was too busy giving me a North strip room in their South strip hotel.

The pool is pretty fantastic.  Lazy river where you can float around with your drink and look at people.  Tons of recliners to lay in and soak up that beautiful Las Vegas sun.  Free towels.  A few bars around the edge so that I could keep myself nice and hydrated (with Vodka).  As I don't drink beer, I can't have beer goggles, and with my lovely vodka goggles I was pretty impressed with the overall crowd.

The casino was amazing.  I might be saying that only because I won money.  Of the three of us that gambled, Kat broke even, Mandy was only down a few dollars, and I paid for a few of my drinks later that night lol... And within about 5 minutes of sitting at a machine, a waitress came over and asked me for my order and brought me a drink within 15 minutes.  Loves it!

We scoped the nightclub early in the day and got wristbands which got us in free all night.  The doorman was fantastic, and remembered our names and let us cut the line when we came back.  We partied until 4ish in the morning... I have no clue when\/if it ever closed.  The music was great, the alcohol was strong.  The scene was fun.

While I don't approve of you bringing your kids to Vegas, there was a pretty awesome arcade downstairs, and the lion habitat was one of the coolest things.  The lions were like standing on my head.  How cool is that? 

Ultimately this was one of the best times I've had underneath one roof in my life.  I can't wait to come back!",3,2,3

It seemed more of a gamers hotel than anything else. Luckily, when we got to our room we found it to be newly remodeled in a very tasteful manner.  We had just spent two night at the Monte Carlo and the room was definitely a step up from what we had just stayed in.  Unfortunately, in many other ways, the Monte Carlo outclasses the MGM.  

The 10 minute walk to the pool area was a pain in the ass.  And considering that we checked in at 5:00 and were leaving in the morning, it rubs me the wrong way that I had to pay the ""resort fee"" when we weren't even able to use the pool for more than 20 minutes (pools close at 6:00 - except for the lazy river, was closed at 5:00.)

The room was alright, it was decently sized, clean, and had all the amenities you'll need in a room in Vegas (hot shower and warm bed). 

I stayed in a king-bed room. The bathroom area is connected to your living area so don't expect a door separating where you're sleeping and where you're washing your face. The toilet and shower doors are clouded glass doors without any locks. So make sure to stay with someone you're comfortable with or tell'em you're using the bathroom because there isn't a lock or a closed room when using a bathroom. 

The customer service could use a little improvement. I arrived at the hotel at 2a.m and the front desk couldn't find my reservation because the system thought I was a no-show even though I paid for the hotel room already. There is a ~$30 resort fee at the MGM in addition to a $100 deposit, in case you trash your room, on top of where you booked your hotel room. 

For those afraid of the cold, make sure to ask for an extra blanket at the front desk. I was freezing in my bed during my first night in my room. I asked housekeeping for an extra blanket and it took 3 tries before getting a blanket to the room. Don't know what kind of red-tape is going on with housekeeping but blankets shouldn't be that hard to get. Additionally, housekeeping comes knocking on your door super early so before calling it a night, make sure to put the do not disturb sign on your door knob. Super early means 9a.m, so normal work hours for normal people. 

For me, walking around the MGM is an adventure, in a bad way. The hallway was like a dungeon and definitely hard to navigate through the entire hotel; maybe it was designed that way so you stay longer on the casino floors. It was hella hard to find the west wing the first time walking through the casino. This place is a maze. Getting from one end of the casino to another was a tragedy. The biggest landmark in the hotel is Hakkasan so telling people to meet in front of the club is easiest. 

For the price I paid for the hotel, it was a decent stay. It's on the south end of the strip so walking to the center takes 10-15 minutes. That walk seem especially long when stumbling back home 5a.m.",6,2,1

Rooms are decent... could be decorated a little better, but they were clean.... beds comfy.... and the bathroom was huge with amazing water pressure in the shower. 

The highlight at the MGM is their pools. LAZY RIVER. That's it. Get an inner tube (we waited til the later hours and just found one floating by begging us to take it) and let the people watching begin. The drinks are good and the jello shots are strong :)

Rooms were by far the biggest for vegas standards. central air, adjustable beds, comfy pillows, robes, free wifi, awesome strip views, marble bathroom, double sinks, tub, and seperate shower, spa toiletries. Overall an amazing hotel for a standard price. they can actually charge more for the size of the rooms. free addmission to pool sundays for wet-republic.

CON's- at night the hotel is popping in the casinos and bars so it can take a while to get through to the elevators to get to the rooms, and to get seated at a restaurant.  Valet was terrible.

They have a wonderful selection of high end restaurants, and there are acres of casino, but I just can't give it 4 stars, and well, it's not a 5 star place.  The rooms are nice, but you can tell that it's been there a while.  The cleaning service was really varied, as sometimes they folded the towels well, and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes the beds were made well, and sometimes not.  The shower had mediocre water pressure, and the elevators had 1 shaft in each tower that made me edgy to get into.  I actually ended up in 1 in each area visiting friends that proved this theory true, but the one in my section would have all of the buttons just turn off if pressed in an odd sequence, so people kept missing their floors.  Very frustrating.  The buffet is mediocre, giving some variety, but not really impressing me.  I also have issues with a place that doesn't have at least $10 tables, but maybe I'm just cheap.

Those were the reasons it isn't a 5 star hotel.  Here are the pros...
The casino has really clean bathrooms.  The selection of restaurants and celebrity chefs is staggering.  The Joel Robuchon restaurants are my favorite places anywhere, so that has to elevate it to begin with.  The Cirque du Soleil show, KA is stunning.  I highly recommend it.  Studio 54 is only so-so, but it's open every night, so you always have a place to dance, even if it isn't the hottest place to go.  The bedding is really nice at this hotel. It keeps up with the amazing bed idea.  I like the roundness of different bars they have. All of them are very inviting, and make you feel conected to the casinos.",4,0,0

Check-in was quick. The receptionist was nice and upgraded us to 2 beds for no extra charge. The lobby had strawberry and pineapple infused water

We had the standard room with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was spacious with bright lights around the mirror. The automatic shades consisted of ""sheer"" as well as ""black-out"", which is a must if you want good quality sleep well into the afternoon after a long, fun, wild night. The TV remote was horrible. The signal lagged or something. 

The casino itself is huge. The elevators are fairly easy to find though. It's a pain when you have to walk deep into the casino from the lobby just to get to the elevator (like Mirage and Planet Hollywood)

The food court is not bad. You can find some cheap, quick food to eat and avoid the high end restaurants. They need to add a Jamba Juice though

The pool is a bit of a walk to the back of the hotel, but it's nice. They have some regular pools as well as a lazy river

Wifi is free IF you have a hotel room. They deactivate it soon after you check out

I had stayed at the MGM years ago as a kid and expected the rooms to be outdated, but on the contrary the rooms, gaming floors, and restaurants were very contemporary and exceeded expectations. 

MGM has a large pool facility including a lazy river for only guests to use. The pools are  adjacent to the Wet Republic Day Club and while I was using the pool, Steve Aoki was at Wet Republic spinning away. The music could be heard but at a distant level, providing background music to to the area. Once I got up to leave, I walked around the facility which was when I discovered the lazy river. If I did not have dinner plans, I would have definitely tried it out!

Hakkasan for my favorite dutch duo, W&W. My bf and I were both on the guestlist but were told that we had to be at the venue by 10PM when the club opens at 10:30PM. We decided to just get tickets which were $20 for female and $30 for male - and these tickets guaranteed our entrance without having to deal with a rowdy crowd to get in. After arriving at around 1:30AM, there was no line at the door and we were in within 2 minutes. The club and decor is pretty standard, the sound system was average, but definitely still a great time. 

MGM also has a large gaming space comparatively to newer hotels, which is perhaps one of the aspects to how they maintain their competitive advantage. With a wide variety of gaming tables and slots, I would not hesitate to recommend this place to a friend who enjoyed a good round of blackjack or craps.

The only con about this hotel is that the location is a bit further from the center of the strip and would require more walking which I am normally fine with. But in 100 degree weather, walking in the heat may become tiresome and exhausting.

Here are the REAL charges that stack up and were greater than the advertised price I paid for the room.  Fortunately I did read the fine print about the resort fee beforehand so I was expecting that BUT did not know about the ridiculous 12% tax added above that and the deceptive ""free"" buffet per ""stay.""  They should simply clarify to say two total buffetsor hand out vouchers. They were able to steal $75 from me but what's worse was the horrible food. Had I known it was not free, I would never even pay $1 for their buffet. 

Add insult to injury are the incredibly rude and obnoxious behavior of two employees. My check in clerk Jerry was sarcastic and made inappropriate comments.   The bell boy who checked my luggage for holding actually said to me ""You know, I won't be here when you pick up your luggage,"" and hesitated as if expecting something to happen.  Umm Yeah and why does he feel the need to tell me that? Ohh are you trying to remind me to tip you because you hauled one small carry on luggage onto your wheeled cart? Seriously?! I get it that any employee working on the strip whether it's a hotel, store or restaurant has to deal with thousands of people from all over the world and after a while they may become numb or rude!   But Disneyland has the same issue and you don't see employees behave so atrociously! I know I'm comparing Disneyland with Sin City, just because the contents are different doesn't mean the service has to be. 

Some tourists' first experience in United States is in Vegas, and I cringe at the idea that if they experience the poor service I received at MGM Grand is any indication of American hospitality, I would be ashamed! 

The only saving grace to this truly one star hotel is Rosa my housekeeper who I happened to chat with on my way out and as she was entering my room to clean.  She worked there 20 years she said. She was friendly and you could tell she still has pride in what she does after all that time.  

It's obvious they don't want to spend any money to update or clean their carpets to the west wing rooms.  Most of the hallway carpets were disgustingly stained while it hides behind the facade of the beautiful polished look of their lobby. The small rooms are outdated from the 80s\/90s era.  They know this and will try to upsell you to their more recently built\/updated grand rooms for an additional $25 more per day or suites for just another $1000 more per day. 

MGM resorts owns 6 hotels on the strip. I won't give any of them one penny of my future business because there were too many misses by too many employees who simply didn't care about my experience.

*My response to MGM's feedback about my review: This only confirms their incompetence and poor customer service by completely ignoring all my other complaints and only saying they're sorry ""I was confused"" about the buffet stipulation is a back handed apology.

I've always stayed at planet hollywood which is the center of the strip and a nice view of the fountain and always loved it they even upgraded us to one of the presidential suite without me even asking. here at MGM they don't seem to care. I wouldn't probably stay here again unless they give me a complimentary room.",0,0,0

The hotel has gone under some renovations but still lacks many of the nice amenities you would find at the Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian, etc.  We stayed in the Celebrity Suite which is a good size.  The bathroom was very aged and it showed.  The shower was decent but you can see all the rust on the tile and shower head.

The crowd that coms here is college age so expect to see a lot of drunks roaming around but hey, it's vegas.  Although there are many elevators, it could take you a while to get to your room during peak hours.  Check-in is a nightmare so I suggest you check in at the airport where they have a little stand.  The staff there isn't as friendly but it is very quick.

The pool was nice.  During the summer days it is sweltering hot having a cabana helps a bit.  Amenities are just alright.  No misting and limited snacks and drinks.",0,0,0

ROOM RATE: perfectly priced. Around $220\/night (shared 4 girls to each room) so it was perfectly priced for us. 

POOL: Famous Lazy river was so fun! And downstairs from our room! Drinks & Food are pricey. But music is fun (Right across from WetRepublic) and vibes are energetic! Get there early to save chairs if you want some. 

FOOD: we didn't really do any of the formal sit down places. We stuck to quick and easy. (Food by the pool, are across the Street at Shake Shack etc.) although we heard many of the places are great. We had drinks at a few of the lobby bars. We had a blast at one of the middle lobby bars who had a great DJ! (SANTOS www.DJSantosLive.com) literally loved him! 

ROOMS: clean, updated, nice marble bathrooms. Provide you the essential typical shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion:) timely housekeeping. Overall happy with the rooms!

SHOPS: if you forgot something...no fear! There were plenty of places to grab something you need (deodorant, bottle opener, bathing suit, floaties, ibuprofen) etc. 

VALET: we came in on a Thursday and left on a Saturday. Therefore, this process was prob faster than most weekend days. Relatively speaking this process was super quick and efficient. I believe it was $20\/per car per day if you stayed at the hotel. (Bummed bc it used to be free with a hotel stay).

My company got me a room here a few months ago for a biz trip. I had never stayed here before and did not know what to expect. Walking around MGM all I could think is that this thing is huge! (That's what she said!) This place is one giant maze that I got lost in a few times. Lots of walking.  

The restaurants range from celebrity chef endeavors to the standard cafe and even a small food court. The shops are a bit basic and not on the scale of the Venetian and other high end casino resorts. There seems to be about three or four Starbucks locations throughout, and each one could have their own zip code!

Some cool bars and clubs here to party in. Brings in a hot looking 20-30 something crowd that offers some sexy eye candy for both men and women. Their pool is a hot spot that's well laid out and offers more terrific views. Uber club Hakkasan Nightclub
and KA by Cirque Du Soleil are a must when staying here.

Was a breeze checking in at 8pm. My Grand Tower room was super nice, modern, spacious, clean, with a comfortable bed. I was placed in a newly renovated Grand King room and it was the bomb! 

After unloading my luggage I went down and goofed around a bit on the $1 slots. Immediately hit a $300 winner and used it to go party!

Close to the center of the strip, lots of great restaurants for anything from quick to fine dining, TWO Starbucks' locations, fairly generous craps and blackjack tables haha.

The lady who helped me check in for our stay this past weekend was exceptionally cheerful and helpful. She asked what in particular brought me to Vegas for that weekend. I let her know that it was a reunion of sorts and that we were all staying in 3 or so different suites at the MGM. Long story short she was nice enough to upgrade our suite and even send up a comp'd bottle of champagne for free!! The hotel employee who brought up the champagne even addressed me by name and specifically asked ""I hope this weekend has been to your special expectations"" with a smile. WoW. Talk about great customer service.

The pools and day club, the restaurants, suite amenities, and most importantly the supreme customer service. What a great value at a reasonable price. 

It's always nice to go to Vegas with friends and\/or someone special (wherever you stay, on the strip or downtown), get more than you pay for in the area of suite upgrade accommodations and free bottles, have the time of your life, get treated like a king, and then come up huge at the tables to equate it to a free trip!

If that's what you're looking for then stay here!

We booked a 4 night stay over Labor Day weekend. With that said I understand it wasn't gong to be cheap but we booked this hotel for the promotion they advertised, 2 free tickets to their day and night club. We called the night before we arrived to make sure our tickets would be available upon arrival and the lady in customer service assured me that we would have no issues.
Surprise Surprise at check in they would not honor the tickets because of the holiday. WTF?!?
So I asked if we could at least get something else in exchange for the miscommunication and they said no. For what we paid I'm sure they could have at least comped a free drink or something but management rudely told us no because it would cost to much to give us anything free and walked away. So we paid for the rooms with a heavy heart and decided not to let it ruin the weekend.

Needless to say we tried not to do anything extra at the hotel as they charge for everything.
Can't use the fridge or they charge $50.00 a day.
Parking even for hotel guests wasn't free. $10.00 a day.
I'm surprised they don't charge for taking selfies with the MGM Lion in the lobby.

Then as we are walking to the elevator I notice a promoter offering free admission to other guests for entrance to their night club. As I am walking by I hoped to receive the same offer but was rudely ignored, even though he made full eye contact with me and even gave me a nasty look.
My sister in law walking behind me was offered and not me. Why? 

Room was very standard. Hot water took forever to work. All the towels had fuzz balls that would stick to you after you stepped out of the shower. 

One of the other reasons for booking here was the Lazy River. There are no rules or regulations at this place. There is a blockage of people just standing ruining the flow. Lifeguards don't even tell people to keep moving. I got stuck in spots so many times because people literally were partying in the middle of the river. When you pay $18.00 a day for a tube I expect it to move with the flow of the river.

So after some research we were able to attend the night club which wasn't cheap.
Hakkassan is so over hyped! No space and over crowded. There is no capacity limit in place.
Apparently the only way to enjoy this place is to pay for thousands of dollars in bottle service.
You will get stepped on and pushed and even kicked out. Yes my group was kicked out for pushing. Less than an hour and $200.00 dollars worth of drinks later. Um everyone was pushing and walking by there was no room. We didn't even get a chance to see the main DJ. 
A guy outside of the club told us they do this every night they are open. They randomly throw people out for ""pushing and fighting"" so they can bring new bodies in.

Thank god we decided against buying Wet Republic tickets. We could see the pool from our window and it was like sardines.

Go to OMNIA at Caesar's Palace or XS\/SURRENDER at the Wynn instead those clubs were awesome and worth the price!

I called today about my security deposit that had not been returned. First person said it takes 5-7 business days. Second person I had the unfortunate chance to speak too was rude and said 7-10 business. He kept taking unnecessarily long pauses during our conversation.
He said I never paid a deposit. I gave him credit card information to prove I used two different cards. Then after another long drawn out pause says oh it has been released. Later I call my credit card company to find out they haven't released it.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!

I can go on and on about how horrible this place was. 
My in laws that stayed at the hotel with us had the same opinions of this place as well. They stayed in another room and paid a pretty penny as well. MGM can stop the horse crap about not making any money if they comped us anything for the weekend.

Long Story Short we will not be returning.

Thanks for the bad experience. Now we know to stay elsewhere next time.

It has terrible feng shui with nothing making sense. Being the largest hotel in the world, I guess they forgot to put in the outside greenery for guests who might like to sit away from the smoke.
BTW, the ventilation system is so bad, the restaurants, including CraftSteak and other high end have open windows that let in the smoke, so virtually there's no place to enjoy that isn't invaded with nicotine.
The non-smoking room was okay but go stay at a hotel without a casino and then go gamble when you want. If you stay at a hotel that has a casino attached, you have the smoking otherwise you don't.
I guess you could say I hated my experience. The food at the MGM and all the casinos is extremely expensive unless you eat at MGM's crappy food court, which looks like any shopping center food court but 3x the price. 
Las Vegas along the strip is the most expensive area I've been to in the States. it makes Manhattan look like a deal. If they don't take your money at the craps table, they'll take it in airport transportation, food, water, drinks or any way they can.

BUT...this place is huge, and not necessarily in a good way. The distance from our room to almost anything is considerable. We never used the pool in part due to the distance, but also due to the very short open hours, and the fact we didn't want to pay $18\/person for the privilege of using the lazy river. Not sure if they charge for towels.

The best thing was wonderful water pressure in the shower. The most annoying thing was the lack of a coffee maker in the room. There are multiple Starbucks on the property, but we weren't in the mood to get dressed and descend into the masses for our morning cup.

Check-in was pretty easy and Earl went to great lengths to try to move rooms around to accommodate my guests and I ensuring as best as he could to place our rooms as close to each other as possible. He also comped us tickets to Hakkasan Nightclub, which I asked for - so don't be shy, worst they could say is no.

MGM offers a good selection of low end eateries to high end fine dining, which by the way is home to my favorite steakhouse: Craft Steakhouse. If you want to splurge, be sure to check it out! Also important, they do have a Starbucks centrally located on the casino floor in case you need that pick-me-up. There are also a few bars  (I really liked Centrifuge) located throughout the casino which makes a good escape to people watch and take a break from the casino floor (which by the way has a good variety of gaming selections).

As for entertainment, you can dance the night away at Hakkasan Nightclub or watch Cirque's KA (I saw it a few years ago and admittedly it wasn't for me, but I really enjoyed O and Mystere).

Our executive queen suite was amazing. I really liked the decor and fell in love with the living room. Some nights I was tempted to just stay in and watch TV, lol! The bed was very comfortable, temperature set was consistent and had good circulation, plenty of closet\/storage space as well as electrical outlets to charge phones\/laptops, etc., water pressure was great, and the entire room was clean. The desk space was also generous and the area by the huge window was spacious. I definitely recommend this room if you are planning to entertain a few guests prior to hitting the town.

The only reason why I can't give it a full 5 stars is because their WIFI is terrible! Actually, it's just shit, shitty, shit. When I called to inquire about it they said at an additional $15 I could upgrade to ""faster"" WIFI, but the ""increase"" in speed would have barely made a dent. Luckily, I was able to use my phone as a hot spot and got some mandatory work done. If you don't have that option, you can always make your way to their business center, but I can't comment on whether or not it's sufficient as I didn't go myself.

Check out was easy peazy through the TV and our bill was correct.

All in all, I really like MGM Grand and will consider this as one of my go-to hotels, unless I want to splurge on something more upscale for a special occasion or if I hit the jackpot. And of course, booking earlier than later will always save you some money. To give you an idea on rates, we booked our room second week of November:

Room Rates:
1\/16\/2014: $94.50 (Thurs)

I had a west wing King. No view at all, windows behind the bed, looking out on to other windows. 
It was part of a deal so I wasn't investing in the room but there were a couple things worth mentioning. 
I had a hand soap open and they provided a new one while leaving my old one behind. That's normal. 
The second to last day, both soaps disappeared all of a sudden. I was still on my original one from when I arrived for my 5 night stay. I was a little confused. 
I just used the shower soap bar instead. 
The water was also mostly all HOT and warm water. To access cold water, I would have to barely open the faucet. 
I had read some previous reviews on yelp that mentioned people not having any hot water at all, so maybe overcompensated by almost killing the cold water from the sink. 
The bathroom counter was also very tiny and awkward. If you didn't have the bath mat down on the floor after a shower, even the smallest amount of water makes the marble floor extremely slippery.

Also nitpicking here: the shower has a door jam\/pad that prevents the glass banging on the title. The bathroom door didn't have this so shutting the door in the middle of the night it would clang loudly, and I would recognize that sound from other rooms too. 

Noise: mostly pretty quiet, though at times it would seem like somebody was in my room talking, and I would hear random pockets of noise (sometimes what sounded like hammering) then it would stop. 

The concierge was very helpful, and easy to talk to and get recommendations from. (J.Hendrix was great). 
The front desk was also accommodating and very professional. 
It's 3.5\/5 for me because there are a lot of restaurant options, there is a direct stop from the monorail (it ends at MGM), and there's some decent night life too.",0,0,0

The AC didn't seem to work too well as we woke up sweating every night even though we had it set in the upper 60s. We were given free parking due to having a pearl rewards card which was nice. When you put the ticket in, you are supposed to be able to also put the rewards card in as well and it wipes the balance of the parking ticket.  However, this did not work a single time for us. Each time we had to call the parking attendant and report that it was not working. It was never fixed and at times would create a line behind us.

The room was great. Clean, spacious and had a nice big flat screen TV. The room view was awesome (25th floor view of the pool). They only have two small pillows on each bed and the comforters weren't as luxurious as I expected them to be. (Paid $900 for 3 nights so I expected to have a nice comfy bed at that price)

Checkout was easy.. Did it through an email I received on my phone. 

My biggest complaint would be that they didn't warn me at check in that if you move anything in the mini fridge you would be charged for it. I didn't read the small writing on the outside of the drive and moved a couple sodas out so I could put my own drinks in there... When I checked out I noticed I was charged for EVERY drink that I simply moved and put back shortly after. Thank god I actually looked at my bill before leaving! I called the front desk and she told me the warning was posted outside the fridge and she will take off the charge but I could be fined an extra $50 if the beverage department went and checked my room's fridge to determine if the beverages (that were basically untouched) were able to be resold. 
Still waiting to hear if I'm going to be charged again or not....

A large modern bathroom with marble flooring and shower tiles. Semi-private commode. The shower has a raindrop shower head which isn't my favorite but the water was hot enough. Just wish there was handheld shower head with more power.

In the bathroom plenty of towels and wash clothes. I was not at all impressed with the soaps however. The soaps and shampoos provided were not luxurious and had virtually no smell. And speaking of soaps once you used them the housekeeping staff did not refill them. Odd. I spotted a house keeper in the hall and asked for more. She loaded me up with them. 

One of the most genius things was the open ended toilet paper holder. Why didn't they think of this sooner? One end of the toilet paper dispenser is left free so the refilling is a snap. I have got to look for one those for my bathroom.

The bed was very comfortable with few exceptions. The pillows were large and surprising heavy. I've never encountered that in a pillow before. They were cumbersome to move around. Concerning the sheets I was reminded of a Seinfeld episode in which George did not want the corners tucked. The sheets were tucked so tightly I could not move my feet. A serving tray sits on the foot of bed and makes a great snack table for drunken feasts in the middle of the night.

Yes of course there is free wifi available on up to 4 devices (i think). There are two options of wifi available. One being free and the other a turbo charged version is I believe $50 per day so be very careful to select the free option. Once connected wifi is available through out the hotel.

A very nice work station sits in front of a mirrored wall. A large picture window includes two type of powered shades. Light diffusing and black out. Took me a minute to figure out how to use that but it was a nice feature. I opted for light diffusing. You can still see out but it blocks harsh light. Blackout, well you know what that is.

There is a mini bar in the room and naturally it consists of overpriced items. I'm not sure if certain rooms come with more mini bar options but there was a list of items on the menu that i did not see in my room. Perhaps you had to call up for them. Who knows?

Be forewarned. Don't think you can eat some $8 pringles and then replace them with a 99 cent version from the local Walmart or whatever the equivalent is in Vegas. As soon as you pick an item up off the tray you will be charged. Even if you just pick it up and replace it.

What is there to do at MGM Grand? So, so much. Eat of course. There is a food court and if you go you'll want to stop at the place that makes the crepes. there's also a McDonalds if you want to watch your budget.

For finer dining check out Emeril's, Joel Rubochon, Tom Collichio's or Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. I've heard tell there is a buffet at the Grand. In fact I was there years before but this time around I did not see\/find it. So i'm not sure if it's still there.

You may also want to check out Wet Republic the pool\/night club. And speaking of nightclubs do stop into Rouge it's fantastic! If you are bored you can also do the CSI game\/tour where you try and solve a crime CSI style.

Naturally there is gaming and lots of it. There's a pretty large casino and while smoking is allowed there is a lovely fragrance piped in which does nicely to drown out the smell of cigarettes unless of course you happen to be near someone smoking.

The hotel is very large but surprisingly easy to navigate. I didn't get lost once.

The Grand is a bit far down the strip within walking distance is Excalibur which has an indoor walkway that will take you the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. To venture further down the strip you may want to purchase a daily pass for the Deuce. The Vegas Strip Bus. An all day pass is only $8 and it runs approximately every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.

There is a system for hailing a car or taxi but much like check-in there is often a long line. I caught a taxi several times before I wised up and learned of the bus. It seems there is no such thing as a taxi ride under $20 in Vegas.",13,4,5

The walk from the parking garage to the hotel is sort of far, especially when you've been walking around a lot.

The check-in area was really nice & filled with fresh flowers. The walls & ceiling looked fabulous.  The casino was big and didn't smell like a cigarette box.

We went to see KA here and then puttered around for a few hours after, so I have nothing to report on the rooms. But a few things did strike me enough to write up a 4-star for the ol' MGM Grand. 

This place is HUGE. Like, get lost as hell huge. Rows and rows and rows of slot machines, a crapton of table games and just people milling around EVERYWHERE. The vibe here was really energetic and fun, and it was just a Tuesday night, so nothing special was going on  (I don't think.)

BUMMED I missed the Lion Habitat. We meant to go back the next day but ended up heading to Old Vegas and then we never made it back. That's totally on my list of to-dos for next time. 

Two Words: Blackjack Switch. New favorite game EVER (see my review of Casino Royale for the full-on love affair)! They also had $5 minimum video blackjack, (real blackjack with a virtual dealer, not the video poker kind) which was kind of strange, but for $5 a pop, a good way to kill some time if you're tired of slots. 

It seemed like the entertainment here we pretty great. We saw KA (separate review) and then they have the Lion Habitat, David Copperfield (although I think that's a limited engagement), and a ton of yummy-looking restaurants. I think there were some other exhibits as well.

I am subtracting 4 stars because our two rooms were dirty.  In our room, I found long black hairs all over the bathroom and the top of our tv cabinet had trash on it.  It probably hadn't been cleaned since it was installed.  Honestly though, the only way we were able to see it is that my husband is 6'6"".  The maids probably can't even reach.  It is still gross though and our friends' room was even worse.  They had a condom box on the top of the tv cabinet with empty wrappers along with trash and dirt.

I booked the room through Expedia as a package with my flights. Apparently, the room booked was the most basic - a Standard King in the West Wing. I did not really have an issue with the size of the room but the hotel has really needs to make an effort in keeping the room and surrounding areas clean. 

1) Light bulb in shower was not working
2) Handle on toilet's glass door was loose
3) Floor in elevator (west wing) was sticky for a whole day - the elevators came quickly but they were not clean
4) Light bulbs in the elevator lobby were flashing and needed to be replaced. We saw it on the day we arrived and they were still flashing when we checked out. It seems like a small thing but it's all in the little things that make a guest feel like an effort was made.
5) I saw a dead cockroach on the escalator coming up from the subway area.

We were up on the 11th floor but where our room was situated, we could hear the garbage trucks reversing loud and clear. 

The checkout option on the TV is great but the lines at check-in were really long. 

The walkway in the West wing to the elevators could probably use some wall hangings or art along the way. The dark grey plastic-looking walls are not attractive. It just felt like we were walking through the basements. It really was the ""back of the house"", not what a paying guest should experience.

I enjoyed my newly remodeled room. It provided the right amount of space and was more comfortable than it needed to be. I enjoyed the some of the restaurants. Sure I only went there during happy because I'm not foolish enough to over spend on over priced food. I enjoyed the shopping amenities as well. Only shopping for things that I normally wouldn't be able to get back home. I enjoyed the pool, the jacuzzi, and working on my tan. All 3 things were free.

It was all down hill after the first night. We decided to go back to the Lobby lounge and was completely ignored by the new servers, who BTW knew we was sitting in the side lounge BECAUSE I asked if it was open. We ordered the same drinks but it was made completely  different. Didn't even have same color, so you knew something was missing. All I knew was the night before it was so freaking good and tonight - like we was at a different bar.  Took 15 min to get 1st drink, and 50 min later I was at the bar asking to cash out for it seemed we had been forgot.

The standard rooms are newly renovated and they're nice, but they are still kinda cramped. Glad they updated the furniture in the executive king suites. I've never stayed in the West Wing so I can't review on that part.

The Marquee suite is cool, but it's the room with the double doors at the VERY end of the hallway which is a pain if you're in heels. Also, the room doesn't even come with a fridge which is strange considering there's a bar area. What I did like about the Marquee suite was that it's a fun space to entertain when you're pregaming. The dining table is perfect for a game of flip cup, the TVs have a connection for your mp3 device, and we even plugged in a Magic Mic for some karaokeing. I also liked that these rooms came with Blvgari bath amenities. I will never forget the memories from ""Club"" 28341 haha.

The plus to staying here is that you can party extra hard at Hakkasan and then stumble on back to your room.

Positive:
The stay was very nice with no noise complaints despite our often group rendezvous being our room before going out.
Plenty of space with a fold out sofa.  
Friendly service when we received it.
Excellent deal on the suite via email from MGM.

Negatives:
Booking was a hassle as I had to spend an hour+ correcting an error in the system that tried to put me in a standard room instead of the suite I booked.
Check in line was at least 45 minutes long.
We did not receive any towels although we asked for them several times.  We had to find a cart in the hall and swipe towels.
Terrible room service (breakfast) that cost $45+ and barely fed two.

Room rates at our usual place were a tad bit too pricey plus with our reservation we got two free buffets a day.  Can't be that bad right?!?  After a quick taxi ride from the airport we were at the MGM lobby and in the long check in line.  I suppose I might have been spoiled at my usual hotel but they offer online check in to people who book through their website and not through a third party website.  You get a nice email, let them know when you will be arriving and they will email you when your room is ready.  When you arrive at the hotel they have a special online check in desk, just show them the email and bam...done in under 10 minutes.  Oh well...so after waiting in line for about 45 minutes we were off to our rooms.  

We were in the West Wing of the hotel and from the elevator closest to the lobby it's a nice stroll to the room.  So the west wing rooms are definitely small but what I found really weird was if you latched the security door stopper if someone opened the door they could see directly into the shower and probably the toilet from the crack.  It's literally like 5 feet away.  So you better put up that ""do not disturb"" hanger and hope it doesn't go missing just so housekeeping can open the door and peek in while you've just gotten out of the shower.  Overall the room was ok for being a room.  There is a West Wing Elevator which is close to the Hakkasan and a Starbucks.  There's also an exit door which leads out to the strip.

The Buffet was ok, we mainly used our free buffet's for breakfast.  I can't imagine the lunch and dinner buffet being all the good.  Breakfast isn't too hard to screw up anyways.  Eggs, omelets,  bacon, hash...can't go wrong.

I've stayed in the grand tower rooms before and thought they were pretty nice but I decided to check these rooms out this time.  Although, they are more modern, they are way smaller and the bathrooms lack any privacy.  I also hurt my toe on the stupid ""modern"" door that closes off the toilet.

I was napping one afternoon and the minibar refill guy busted into my room and proceeded to go through the minibar for 3 minutes insisting I ate the peanut M and M's even though they were still in the minibar.  Then he validated the expiration date on every item.  Thanks for that.

One of my co-workers was sleeping (in the middle of the night) and Security let a drunk guy into her room because drunk guy insisted it was his room (he was in the wrong hotel, right room number).  She had to run out of the room and chase down the security guard because he opened the door and took off.

This hotel tries to be all things to all people - it houses a Cirque show (Ka), a venue for concerts, a venue for fights, a lounge (Tabu), a club (Studio 54), a spa, what seems like a dozen restaurants, a lion habitat, and, of course, a massive casino. The only thing it lacks is decent shopping. The rooms and service generally are fine. It does get crowded, but that's like all of Vegas. It's not the Bellagio, but it's not Excalibur either - it's an affordable yet relatively hip place to rest your head when you're living it up in Vegas.",0,0,0

My boyfriend decided to book a room here for his 23rd birthday and wanted to do it big so he got a Skyline Terrace Suite for the weekend which cost about $2,000. 

Upon arrival, the front desk receptionist told him that he couldn't come into the room because the air conditioning was broken. First of all, it is the middle of November so we wouldn't have even used the air conditioning. And second of all, why exactly would we NOT be allowed into the room for something as simple as that? When we stayed at the Bellagio our AC was also broken in the summer and they let us check in and come into our room with no problem. Kind of surprising but whatever, we complied and we were told to come back an hour later. 

An hour goes by and my boyfriend decides to go check in on the room and the receptionist makes him wait and places a call, saying that she has to check if housekeeping is finished. Um, check-in is at 3pm and it was 4:30pm when we came back. Shouldn't housekeeping be finished BEFORE check-in? What kind of lame excuse was that? Not impressed. 

When we finally get into the room we quickly realized that we actually booked the wrong one. We thought we had booked a 2-bedroom suite but we only had one. So he calls and asks if they have any rollaway beds available and the woman on the phone says that there aren't any available and they don't do that at this hotel. Uh, since when did hotels NOT have rollaway beds...? Luckily there were a lot of couches in the suite so his best friend just decided he would sleep on that instead. Why ruin a trip when everything else was going on, right?

So the skyline terrace suite is absolutely gorgeous. It's got two stories and a beautiful terrace with a breathtaking view. One of the things I loved most about it was the patio speaker which also played indoors. Not really going to comment on the outdated electronics in the room but let's just say we got lucky cuz I had my auxiliary cord on me. 

Now with a room like that we're bound to go and host a party of our own. So we invited a couple of friends over to pre-game before heading over to the nightclubs for the evening. I go and give housekeeping a call and ask for 4 toilet paper rolls because we have a lot of friends coming over and let's be honest, when you've got a bunch of drunk people over they're gonna pee every five minutes so we knew we would need a few rolls. The person on the phone, I think her name was Maria, rudely said that she could only provide the room with the exact number of guests that were in there and then hung up. I mean, I understand that there's a policy about how many amenities guests can ask for but did she really have to be rude about it? 

We also decided to call for extra pillows and blankets since my boyfriend's best friend had to sleep on the couch and though the guy was really nice about it, it took over an hour and a half before we even received our things. 

I can't say that we didn't have an amazing time because despite the terrible things that happened our group made the most of our trip. But I will not sugarcoat it when I say that I am so beyond disappointed by the customer service at MGM grand that I do not plan on EVER staying at this hotel again. At $2,000 dollars for one of their best rooms, to have been treated with such rude behavior is such an insult and disappointment and whenever I look back at this experience I will always remember MGM grand at having the worst customer service compared to other hotels on the strip at significantly lower prices.",7,1,1

Overall I do like the hotel but the location is too far south on the strip. It's somewhat far from the middle of the strip where there is more to do IMO. It's a long trek to get to some of the hotels where a lot of fun clubs and restaurants are so that is one of my main issues with the MGM. In 100 degree heat or in the winter, all that walking is no fun. 

The prices are reasonable IMO. For my three stays at MGM which were all for 3 days each, the average total for a basic room was between around $250-$280.

The front desk clerks are nice, no issues with checking in or out, my rooms have always been clean, etc. My parents on their last two trips to the MGM had problems, one being  that there toilet overflowed for which they were moved to another room nearby, given a free upgrade on their next trip as well as  free buffets passes. The 2nd issue was something with plumbing and they could hear the pipes making noise all night so after mentioning it to the front desk they got free buffet passes. So overall the guest services have been pretty on point. They also have the business center where you can print out your boarding passes for free. At check in, the clerk was nice enough not to charge us those ridiculous resort fees, which I appreciated.

The hotel is very large and it's easy to get a bit lost but once you've been there awhile you get used to it. I like that the monorail is located in the hotel so it's nice to be able to have that alternative to taking taxi's or walking. Also there are a lot of dining options, from low end McDonald's to higher end restaurants like Joel Rubuchon.

If MGM was in the middle of the strip, it would be perfect.",1,0,0

I come here for conferences and always dread the half our trek it takes to get anywhere within the hotel (especially from room to conference center). Most of the hotel feels outdate, I'm not sure they're doing anything to restore the rooms and hotel. A better slogan for MGM would be ""There's a charge for thtat"". Charge for storing your personal belongings in the mini-fridge, charge for using the pool, resort fees. Customer support and their mobile site are also pretty useless.

We could hear everything our neighbors did and said. The mattresses were very firm and the piloows were goose down rocks. The decor was lovely, though. No shower cap. Very, very long walk from the elevators to our room. They really need to install a few more elevators because that walk from room 200 to room 335 was ridiculous. They need more shade by the pools, otherwise you will burn like hell in 117+ degree weather, which is what it was this past weekend. The buffet was $40 for lunch and dinner, $30 for breakfast and brunch, and it wasnt the best, but it wasnt horrible. Crab legs were water logged. Good dessert bar though. But what really makes me never want to return was the $28\/night resort fee they charge you upon check out.  Add that to the room tax of $15.25, and there is an additional $43\/night on top of your room fee. Oh, and you couldnt use the in-room fridge without paying and using a combination to unlock it.

We stayed on the MGM Grand the weekend before Thanksgiving. Really good rates that weekend. Tip: sign up for the MGM resorts promo emails and you can check their calendars for special weekends that are cheaper then normal. I usually find a cheap weekend, then do an online search on hotels.com or priceline and book the deals. Often times you might find a cheaper rate online. But MGM often offers food and beverage credits if you book through them. 

I got the executive queen suite in one of their newly renovated towers. It was $88 for a Sunday night off of priceline. Not too shabby! The check in process was pretty quick. The line looked long but moved quickly and the lady that checked us in was super nice. 

The renovated rooms are very modern. It feels high end. The queen suite (675 sq ft) was just big enough for 4 people. I was very spoiled by the MGM Signature suite I stayed in earlier this year. It was 980 sq ft. =P
The beds were comfy, it was nice to have two flat panel TVs in the suite and a generous sitting area. The bathroom was also nice, it had a tub and a shower. The towels were a tad rough, but they gave us tons, which was nice. The floor was nice and quiet.

No real complaints, except for the fact that the wifi was a bit slow and even with a $28 dollar resort fee, we didn't have access to the gym! It us an additional $15 more. We only had access to a small cardio room that held maybe about 10 tread mills and 10 ellipticals. My cousin said that it was very packed in the morning. As a paying guest, I was expecting more. Considering the MGM Grand are also advertising ""wellness"" rooms. Well, why not let us exercise too! 

Anyways, aside from my wellness rant, the MGM is located in a fairly good location. Even though it is one of the older hotels on the strip, they have made strides in upgrading. Oh and the KA theater is right down stairs. Great show! =)",3,1,1

They consider the three buildings of The Signature at MGM Grand and The Mansion at MGM Grand to be apart of the resort as well.....but I am only reviewing the main hotel.

Now, I booked MGM Grand for four days in September of 2009 and I believe I can give a solid un-biased review.

The Room: I was booked into room 18-124.  Which is room 124 on the 18th floor.  Our room was facing the pool and towards Boulder Highway.  The first thing I noticed is that the room was quite nice considering the negative reviews I've read on Yelp and TripAdvisor.  The queen bed I had was VERY comfortable and each day I woke up I didn't want to get out of the bed.  The bed was far superior to the one at Mandalay Bay where I stayed in June.....and that was hard to beat.

The room had a nice flat screen LCD TV......but it was in what I refer to as a TV coffin.  Armoires are tacky in my opinion and especially when you jam a very nice flat screen in it.  It would have been better served mounted on the wall.  No biggie, it was nice considering the basic rooms at the Bellagio still contain the older CRT Tube Televisions.  

The bathroom was smaller than I had anticipated but that was no issue really.  The sink had a crack in it, but did not effect the use of it.  I kept in mind this resort was built in 1993 and even after remodeling things are bound to have some flaws.  I personally feel that the room was worth what I paid.  ($55 per night)

The Food: Now the offer I got with my room included 3 free buffets per day, per person.  I will review the buffet separately, but lets just say the buffet is average.  On the final day I had booked a separate promo which gave me a $50 resort credit.  Since I wasn't interested in seeing any shows or going to the Spa or retail stores, I used this at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant.  I feel that Wolfgang Puck's was delicious, albeit the servings were VERY small.  I had the Maine Crab cakes which are no longer served on their menu.  The price was $20 for 4 silver dollar sized crab cakes.  Not a good value, but very delicious.   I would come here again even with the prices I don't like because it meal was delightful.

Gambling:  Here is where MGM Grand and I differ in our views.  I am a low roller.  I have plenty of cash, but when I gamble or play in a casino I don't like to throw all my money on the table.  I am in Vegas for the food, the sights and the shows.  The gambling part is another factor.  MGM Grand has average limits at most times, but if you want good odds the price goes up on the minimums.  

Not once did I see a $5 blackjack table..........and I can understand that because if you put out a $5 BJ Table that pays 3:2 with 6-deck shoe,H17, Late Surrender, and Resplitting Aces......the house edge of 0.46%.  Which is a theoretical\/expected loss of 46 cents per $100 played.  Now, if they had $5 tables with such rules on the strip at MGM Grand........it would not be very profitable for them.  That's why the limits jingle from $10-25 at the Pit Boss's digression. So, no blackjack here for Brian.

I was able to find a $5 craps table which maintains a house edge of 1.41% and offered the strip usual x3-4-5 odds.  Not too bad, but after 6pm the minimum went up to $10-15.  Understandable.  The dealers were lukewarm and decent I suppose.  I didn't make any money playing here and had an average time.  I have more fun playing craps at the Excalibur and Tropicana though......which may shock some people.  The dealers are more energetic and funny to be around and talk to.  (See my Tropicana Review). 

I suppose if you have a decent bankroll the MGM Grand could be a nice place to play.........but it's a large casino floor and there are so many people here that you're just another number to the employees of the casino.  The size of the casino causes the feeling that there is a lack of personal touch or personality. 

Design: This place is huge.  They did an walking survey that from the main entrance on the strip all the way to your hotel room on the middle of the tower is about one mile long.  The hallways of the hotel where the rooms are located bring that feeling from the movie Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock.  It seems like the end never comes no matter how far you walk.  It takes a long time to go from the front end to the monorail entrance or from the rooms to the buffet.

Conclusion: The MGM Grand is great if you get promotion codes online.....like from Slickdeals.net or FatWallet.  MGM Grand is a nice hotel\/casino.  It's size and popularity is a positive thing in my opinion.  The overall vibe of this place is positive and in a good location in my view.  I am returning for one night in February for $55 with a $100 fine dining credit at Aria in CityCenter.  SCORE!",3,0,1

The rooms are priced right. Not too expensive for what you get. I've always recieved a super clean room and the staff make you feel important. 
The casino is super large with high ceilings so if smoke bothers you, this is one of the more open hotels so chainsmoking grandma won't make you gag as you walk by.

 So this was my first time in Vegas since being 13. Came here with my PIC and told him this was the place I knew I wanted to go to since they have a TON of spots to eat within the hotel. Sadly I only ate at two of them LOL. My ass slept most of my Vegas trip actually. 

  Anyway we arrive and go to the front desk. Check in seemed easy breezy. We were on the westside so there wasn't this crazy walk to the elevators.  I wasn't used to the hustle and bustle of getting to it . Anywho we get to the 17th floor and man our  walk to the room was a fuckin long walk! Well the bigger rooms are in the back because when we opened the door it was a nice suite!!!! I loved the large couch with that spot you can stretch your legs and sleep on. We had the his and hers sinks and a jacuzzi! Not the best view (Hooters hotel across the street lol) So it would have been niceto get the view on the side with all the other hotels. No worries, The room was off the hook and the bed was so comfortable. So comfortable, my ass slept more than anything in Vegas. I shit you not I got my rest FOOOOOO SHOOOO! 

I didn't care for any of the gambling. I gambled 6 bucks. I don't get off pressin buttons gettin nothin. Tables scare the shit out of me way to intimidating.  But I enjoyed going to Fat tuesdays about 5 times :D 

I was very comfortable here. I just think next time I need to stay in the middle of the strip because I refused to walk around. I felt like MGM was back of the bus of all the good stuff on the strip.  Oh well I still slept good and I enjoyed that Jacuzzi tub!",3,7,1

They all booked rooms here based on the pool, so I went on hotwire and booked a room for my boyfriend and myself.  While hotwire is all about not telling you what the hotel is they give you a map and its pretty easy to tell which hotel you will be in.  So that was all pretty easy.  I called them and specifically asked for a smoke free room with a king bed.  That was all pretty easy and nice.

Our room was in the West Wing, which is pretty reviled on yelp and I understand why.  While nothing was super bad about our stay, some things made it not a place I would pay to stay in again:
-the valet, there are like 5 entrances to the MGM by car, but only one of them takes you to the valet. WTF
-the west wing hallways are seriously dark and kinda skeevy looking
-no mini fridges in the room
-horrible cable, they have like 7 channels and 5 of them not in english
-security came and scolded my friend for leaving the door to her room open while we were in it
-the rooms have absolutely no sound proofing at all. you can hear everything in the hallway and in the rooms next to you.  
-$15 a day for wifi.  
-no robes
-i tried to move the side table closer to the bed and it was super sticky, since we had just gotten there, that was pretty gross

MGM is supposed to be nice, but they obviously put all the people who purchase rooms on the internet in lame rooms with absolutely no amenities.  If I were to ever stay here again I would have to make sure it would not be in one of these rooms.",0,0,0

We chose to stay here for a wedding and blocked a cluster of rooms (10+) about 4 months in advance. When we arrived, our rooms weren't ready. We arranged for early check-in and had several members of our party waiting for hours to get checked in. I personally did not get into my room until after 5:00pm even though standard check-in time is 3:00. I booked a suite and they kept telling me to come back to the desk to see if it was ready. Mind you we arrived at 10:00am. I suggested they call me when it was ready since I had to keep waiting for hours. They said they didn't usually do that. They called me 3 times to tell me my check-in was being delayed because the current occupant kept requesting a later check out. The customer service to handle the matter was not accommodating. One of the people staying with us even found bed bugs in their room!!! This was highly upsetting considering the status of the hotel. We brought a lot of business to the hotel for a wedding and our guests rooms were not ready upon arrival. 

Once we got to our suite it stunk! We had to call someone to come spray a deodorizing spray. We called down to the front desk and someone came up within 45 minutes to fix it. That worked!  The wall plugs did not work to charge our phones, they kept ""spitting"" them out. The convenience USB portals on the TV stand didn't work either. 
Wi-fi connection was very weak. We couldn't stay connected even while sitting in our room. 

Forever Grand Chapel - The wedding ceremony was nice but, a lot of what we discussed with the coordinator leading up to the event did not flow correctly. It felt rushed behind the scenes. 

The pool was cold but, staff was friendly and we enjoyed our time there!

Christophe Salon staff was awesome! They exceeded our expectations with the services we received. The staff was friendly and exceeded our expectations with makeup and hair services as we prepared for my sister's wedding. They got us in and out and we looked awesome!

Fiamma - The staff handled our huge party with ease and class. The food was amazing!! We enjoyed everything that was brought out!

Avenue Café - Staff was accommodating and friendly! Food was delicious and exceeded what I thought it would be. This was our last meal in the hotel and it was great!

The only issues we had was the rooms overall and customer service handling that. We prepared months in advance so and our wedding guests would have a smooth stay. Our issues weren't the hotels issues. They were more concerned about how they looked rather than accommodating us.",0,0,0

I booked a room at the MGM Grand because I had previously stayed there and it seemed pretty decent for what we could afford and they had this promotion going on where we get all these great credits like 25 slot credit, 2 for 1 at the spa, and free drinks at the pool.

The front desk lady was so rude. When I presented my debit card, she told me there would be a $200 charge if I wanted to charge things to the room since it wasn't a credit card. When I was looked confused about it and asked her to explain, she told me they would CHARGE me 200 so I could charge to my room. MY friend and I were even more confused after that, then the girl looks at us and says,""Do you want it, or not?"" Of course we say no. Remember those great resort credits? Can't use them cuz we can't charge to the room! And she FAILED to mention that.

We get into our room and it is ok...til we get into the bathroom and realize that the toilet is leaking. We got a room on the 4th floor....so our view was really craptacular. I also requested a smoking room, and we got placed in a non smoking room. When we called to complain, they said they were at full capacity and would send up ashtrays. Vegas was fun, but MGM was not. I will definitely stay somewhere else next time.",2,1,0

  My wife and I just stayed here for 6 nights for a business trip checked in to the hotel on behalf of our retail store the room was paid for and all incidentals were included with the credit authorization form the hotel provided. which I also had a copy of just in case. Immediately they told us we needed another form of payment so I provided them the credit authorization form. ""Alright you guys are all good, you'll be able to charge to the room no problem enjoy your stay"" if you have been to Las Vegas you know everything is double to triple the price it should be. so after 3 days we had charged a few items to the room. And there's a wonderful blinking message light on the phone in our room. I call to see what the message is. I get the run around by 3 different ppl ending the call with ""there's no message on your account please disregard"" okay.... 
The next night we order room service. ""Sorry you are not set up to charge to your room"" alright time to take a trip to the front desk. 
    The guy at the front desk calls the cashier "" sorry about that you guys are all set, I just had the clear something up with the cashier enjoy the rest of your stay"" I knew this was not the end of it because I could clearly see on the itemized bill they were only allowing our credit card to be charge for the cost of the room but apparently this was far to much for the staff to grasp. 
 Our last day arrives, 530 am there's the message light on the phone again this time guest services says your card was declined..infuriated but calm, I work customer service and know all to well getting mad generally doesn't help any situation. I head to the front desk level headed, where the manager insists the card is declining. Not the case there was plenty of room on the card the hotel Is just declining to use my card for reasons I cannot understand, they want another form of payment. So I provide them my other card which DOES decline because my Michigan credit union does not know I'm traveling. Sweet..he takes my card to the cashier and say ""we can try the emergency line"" comes back to tell me the emergency services line does not open until later. Which was a flat out lie. It's a 24hr line and I called it immediately after they did just to insure I was not about to pay them twice. the manager proceeds to tell me that he is going to have security escort my wife and I out of the room and we will not be able to take our luggage, since we cannot pay our bill. We are talking about $300 and they're are going to steal our personally belongings rather than just sending us a bill after we fly home. seriously. I will just pay you cash, the last bit of cash I have to make it home....luckily I did not gamble away all my cash and did have enough to cover the room charge balance. 
 Bottom line this place had such a complete lack of respect and willingness to help a customer that paid hard earned money to be there. We were lied to multiple times and threatened at 530 in the morning the day of check out. I have never been part of such a completely terrible hotel experience and with never again be staying at the MGM grand.",0,0,0

I'm glad I decided to hop hotels this vacation or I would've been miserable the whole time. First, upon checking in, the pretentious desk clerk was rude right from the start, with his nose high-in-the-sky the whole time. He assigns me my room after I told him it was my first time staying here and he gave me keys without pointing me in the right direction. The rooms are so far away from everything. So after about an hour of trying to find my room, I finally find the general hallway and it's disgusting! He put me in the west wing which is totally gross! I put up with it since it was only for one night and at a great rate. The halls look like skid row. The walls and carpets are very dark, gloomy, and have funky smells.

When I walk into my room, it is worst. Again it's very dark and gloomy, even with every light on. The entire room is smaller than your standard hotel room, the bathroom is terrible for getting ready in (if you're a girl), and at about 3am I found cockroaches!! IIICK! I ended up switching rooms but same scenario in the new room. Once again, the desk clerks could care less.

The only plus of staying in the West Wing at MGM is that you can get the hell out of there.

The pools were ok; the lazy river was small, nothing like Casino Morongo's in San Bernardino. Wet Republic was cool but you still had to pay a cover even if you're a guest at MGM. LAME. Hard Rock doesn't make you pay a cover if you go to Rehab. The limits on the gambling floor were also pretty high so I didn't gamble here as much.

This was the first and last time I'll ever stay at MGM. It blows.",6,1,1

I stayed in a suite on the 10th floor for three nights. There are a lot of great things about the hotel\/casino and a few things that could use improvements. My group had two other rooms booked as well, a deluxe room on the 10th floor and another on the 21st.

We were promptly whisked away from the airport by their limo service which was fantastic. The valet\/taxi\/driver service is impeccable at the hotel. The front desk staff were hit or miss depending on the time of day\/level of hotel activity. Some were outstanding some were just okay. 

The rooms were very clean, the 21st floor is a little less modern than the 10th. No iPhone dock\/ stereo in the rooms was frustrating and their TVs had no premium channels making downtime and pre-gaming in the rooms less than thrilling. The decor of the suite was kinda all over the place. Beds were great, although I spent very little time sleeping in mine. Room service options were also less than desirable. 

Their pool area was huge, although the water was a little cold for swimming. We spent some time in the sun and hot tubs. A lovely server brought us buckets of beer. Check-out was easy with no surprises on the bill and the limo service back to the airport was on par with the pickup. 

The hotel is on my preferred side of the strip. Hooters (is a dump) but has cheap fare. New York New York is right across the way, Excalibur and Luxor aren't too far. You really can't go wrong with the MGM. I remember when it first opened and the improvements they have made over the years have always been in the right direction.

Check In:

We arrived in Vegas Thursday but our room wasn't booked till Friday so we stayed at the Luxor our first night in vegas.  This is an important detail cause it tempered my expectations of MGM the next day.  We were in no real rush to check in since my car was already parked in the garage and I had stuff to do Friday night.  When we checked in some time around 8pm Friday line wasn't bad and staff was courteous enough.  One thing that caught my attention was, the lady checking us in informed me that we checked in late and because of that we had a room on the first floor and a 'long walk'.  In other words, had we not been busy spending money on their casino floor and drinking in their bars we could have had a better room.  I doubt she knew where were spending our money aside from the room but it's worth noting.  

Room: 

The room we got was on the first floor down a pretty long hallway.  It was literally the LAST room in the hall all the way at the end (1558).  There were no windows, and it was sweltering hot.  Again, had I not wasted all that time spending money in their casino, I could have gotten a better $350\/night room.  When the time came to go to bed on night one, our room was pretty hot.  I had the AC and thermostat set to 65, after about an hour the temp in the room was 85 with the fan on high.  I called the front desk and after about a 15 minute hold was able to request some assistance.  Maintenance was nice and arrived about 10 minutes after my call.  They replaced an air filter and the temp was better but not great.  With the AC on at all times, I never got the temp below 77 degrees.  I didn't sleep well both nights... too hot.  On a positive note, the room setup and decor were actually very nice, I just had a shitty location.

Casino: 

The casino was pretty sweet.  I did notice while playing slots (I know, dumb) for a very long time, not once was I offered a drink of any kind, a phenomena I didn't not encounter in any of the other casinos I wasted my money in all weekend.  I gambled in their for a few hours.  Half the time I went to a bar and ordered a bourbon and coke I got Jack Daniels.  It's a bartender's job to know their craft and they can't make the distinction between bourbon and tennessee whiskey... shameful.  Aside from that staff was very nice, and food was good.

Overall:

I don't know if it was me or they had an off weekend but this was not a good experience by any stretch.  I spent over a thousand dollars at this casino and left feeling duped.  Again, the service itself was friendly and good for the most part.  I don't think I'll be staying here again.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Weird thing is, I spent a night in the much cheaper Luxor and my experience was superior in almost every way.  If this is the modus operandi at most casinos in Vegas, my inclination is too go cheap next time.  At least then I'll feel like I got what I paid for.  Hope this helps.",1,1,0

For one, it's location is not ideal unless you want to spend most of your time walking back and forth between Caesars \/ Bellagio area, and the fact that the Casino is confusing AS ALL HELL to navigate, my friends and I literally got lost every night.

I like the MGM Grand because there are a ton of things to do here for adults as well as kids.  A big BONUS, is that this hotel does a pretty good job at getting rid of the cigarette smoke that dominates the air space of many hotels.

The sixteen course starts at $425 a person and let me tell up it will rock your world. This is my favorite place about the MGM. 

I don't really like anything else here. The casino is very large and you just can't get personal service unless you are playing in the high limit areas.

I booked it anyways and was pleasantly surprised that they had honor the reservation. 
Not only that, I got to shake the hand of the manager on duty. If I had any concerns, I could just phone in. I was placed in their newer rooms, a Grand Queen room
http:\/\/www.mgmgrand.com\/hotel\/new-grand-queen.aspx

Now, I have stayed here before in the same type room. So I know exactly how it was before. It wasn't bad but it was dull, lacked color. Well, there is now an abundance of color splashed on the walls with art. I noticed the walls were actually the same (look closely, they are actually a little dirty) , they just remodeled pretty much everything else, including all the cabinetry and the fixtures. It had lots of energy and vibrance to it. Not bad for a remodel. 

The cons of this room was that they had that mini electronic fridge bar. The one that is really sensitive. So when my bill came upon checkout, I had to make an extra call to let them know nothing was taken. 

Something also really strange was that when we came back after dinner, the TV was on. Huh? Someone came inside the room and dropped off robes and slippers. Oh, a night turndown perhaps? Or someone just got bored and watched TV because the beds weren't made. 

But there were plenty of positives. The Yelp rate, like my elite friends who stayed here, got a bottle of Veuve Clicquot.

Yes, it is crisp and refreshing, one of the better brands I've tasted. 
Yes, I did get chocolate and Fuji water too. 
I was given a late checkout considering the Billboard awards was the next day.

My only gripe for this trip was the pool here could use a little help. From the last time I was here, it has changed quite a bit. It is now louder, more people, and the theme of the pools doesn't help the guests navigating through it. I have no idea how to get to the pool I wanted and help was non existent. It was just a clusterf*ck of people drinking and fighting. I'm not condoning it, it was just way too many people and by the time I got there, the lazy river was closing even though the pool is supposed to be closed at 7pm. 

Another gripe is that the Lion exhibit is closed currently. Why????

My past stay here have consisted of getaways with friends and roommates. 
I have also booked a group of rooms here before and had a really horrific experience, including lack of hot water and being forced to prepay for all the room for all the days. 

This stay, by comparison, was terrific for the most part. If it can be like this everytime, I would be coming back for sure. Until then, I will wait for the renovations be over. I somehow always stay at MGM when they're doing some sort of renovations, maybe I just have bad timing. Either that or they are always doing these Renos. I will make sure I checked the calendar from their website next time.",1,1,1

Luckily, missed the line for check in. So got checked in fairly quickly. Started our trek to the room and we got to the hallway and our room was all the way at the end. My mom has a bad knee currently and I went back down to ask for a new room. Got a room right next to the elevator on a different floor very quickly.

Liked the layout of MGM. Rooms were nice and hotel hallways were less smoky than New York New York.

Didn't have hot water for our shower and we said something about it. A work order got put in and they said nothing was wrong...still no hot water. I decided to leave it running for a half an hour and it finally started to get warm. Shouldn't have to wait that long...what a waste of water. Told the hotel desk about this upon checkout and she waived the resort fees which was nice.

Overall, will stay here again. Just hope they have the hot water on!",0,1,0

Early in the morning of November 21, 1980, a fire started in the wall of one of the restaurants. It burned for hours without anyone knowing, which is basically what happened in The Towering Inferno. By the time it was noticed it was out of control, and 85 people were killed. The building was repaired and sold (it's now Ballys) and MGM built a new 5,000-room hotel on the next block south, which remains the largest hotel in the United States to this day.

I kind of like the MGM Grand, partly because of this crazy history, and partly because it's such a weird, humungous, strangely colored green monstrosity. It's not really themed (the one that burned down had a seriously in-your-face Wizard of Oz thing happening) but it still has touches that reference its old Hollywood Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer roots. My nana worked for Metro-Goldwyn in the '30s and was David O'Selznick's secretary when he made Gone With the Wind; one day she took Vivien Leigh shopping in Manhattan and Ms. Leigh bought her a cocktail glass with a seagull on it. 

But it's not a perfect hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, but when we upgraded to a strip view  for sixty bucks I was disappointed to find that the windows had a dark screen built into them which takes away from the vista. 

The casino smells like a cougar's perfume. It's also a very long walk to get anywhere -- God forbid you get to the pool and forget your copy of Bonfire of the Vanities. It's also the only Vegas pool I've ever been to where you don't have to fight to the death for a lounge chair. The sound system is very high quality, which is one of those things you don't think is a big deal until you get stuck with one that isn't.

A spin down the lazy river is like floating through It's a Small World After All except it's 11 a.m., everyone's hammered and the dolls all wax their chests.

If ever there was a three-star hotel, this is it. It is absolutely a step above Luxor, Excalibur, and Monte Carlo -- and an unmistakable step down from Caesar's, Mandalay Bay and the Venetian. The MGM Grand is the hotel version of your middle-aged, middle-class brother-in-law who works as a regional manager for a decent-sized company and earns a high-five-figure salary. Which is to say, he's doing just fine, he's comfortable, he drives a car with a sunroof and his wife is a solid six. But at the end of the day, would you really want to be him?",7,11,1

The valet guys, housekeeping, the employees at all the restaurants, the check-in process and everyone in between... were INCREDIBLE! The customer service was stellar from the minute we walked in the door, to the minute we left. I felt pampered, appreciated and truly satisfied with the entire experience. 

We arrived around noon and there were multiple people in line for check-in.  However, they had a full staff of about 10 people checking people in, so it went very quick.  The young lady at the desk was extremely pleasant and helpful with all of our quesitons.  We booked and paid for our reservation in full through United Vacations.  Upon check-in, we were offered a suite upgrade for a total of $140 for our a 4 night stay. I jumped on that chance.

For the amount of people in and out of the hotel daily, it was always clean enough to eat off the floor. The suite was superior, very spacious and the bed was super comfy!  The bathroom featured a separate tub and glass enclosed shower (see photos).  The water pressure was good and the water was actually HOT!  I am most of the time dissatisfied with water temperature, but I was pleasantly surprised this time around.

I personally won quite a bit in the casino and didn't spend much, so I was pretty stoked about that. I liked the selection of 1 cent through $5 slot machines and the video roulette was pretty cool.  

We had free WiFi, which hasn't been offered at any other hotel on the strip. There is faster WiFi available for a fee, but the free one suited my needs (to upload pictures and view the airline website) just fine.

I had one issue (brought on by myself) on the last day here.  I received an email with my receipt for the hotel charges. I viewed it and pressed the button to ""accept.""  I didn't realize until a minute later, I had just checked myself out of the hotel at 5am.  Grr.  The room keys were no longer working (that was a quick and easy process, I must say!)  A trip down to the lobby fixed the issue very quickly.  We had two new keys in under 5 minutes and the customer service was great!  We called down to check out when we were really leaving later that afternoon.  

I can't say enough about this place..the food, the drinks, the casino and the atmosphere..I never expected it would be so good. I felt they had a good amount of people on staff for everything, to suit my every need. Whether it was to park my car, get help\/directions, keeping the bathrooms clean (never once did I see one that wasn't) or housekeeping for our room, the service was stellar. Everyone went above and beyond to make sure my stay was great. 

I hope if you decide to stay here, you'll have the same experience.",2,0,0

I visited MGM Grand years ago and remember having a horrible experience - leaking water pipes, huge water beattles in the room, ugh.  So this visit initially was a pleasant surprise.  Nice rooms, really comfy bed, decent room service.  So far, so good.  Then we start to take a little tail spin:

- Shower and tub were draining slow.  By the second night, they wouldnt drain at all. I don't want to ""gore"" you with the details - maintenance had to be called and we weren't happy.  They comp'ed one night stay for the inconvenience, which was a nice gesture

- The elevators, oh the elevators!  Half the time they weren't working or would take too long.  i would try and re-route myself by going to another floor and trying to catch and elevator there.  Or riding the elevator up just to get down.  Ugh, what a debacle.  Seriously, it was annoying knowing that I had to give myself a 15 minute lead time just to get to the lobby.  Then the thought crossed my mind - fire.  Hmmm... thanks for making it blantantly obvious that I'm screwed if there is an emergency.  That comfy bed didn't seem to make me sleep so well after that revelation

The best part about the MGM was the fact that everything that I wanted to do was right there - pool, concerts, casino, shows... But I am sure that is true of any of the hotel\/casinos in Vegas.  Its average.  I would consider staying there again if all the attractions\/concerts that I want to see are there... otherwise, I think I'm gonna cruise the strip.  Maybe I'll get lucky somewhere else ;)",1,0,0

For gambling, their tables are decent ($25 minimum at just about everything after 10pm), but why is there no kiosk to check your comps anywhere in the building? I had to ask like 3 people where the machine was (standard in every other casino and there's one seemingly around every corner), and found out at the end that I had to pick up a courtesy phone to speak to a customer service rep who gave me my comp total over the phone...seems terribly antiquated for a supposedly high-end casino.

The beds are also very comfy, as well as the pillows. I hardly noticed my fiance moving around during the night. So its pretty easy to get a good nights sleep here. 

Another awesome bonus, walking in from the parking structure up to the lobby, you pass a Fat Tuesdays! Yum! Dont forget to keep your glass and save a couple bucks on refills!

One drawback, the casino floor is very large so you can definitely get lost. But there are alot of employees around that are helpful.

They actually did nothing and we took cold showers and had to bath our 6 month old son in a cold sink bath.

There were towels spread on the sink, someone's Starbucks cup was still sitting on the bathroom counter, the toilet seat was up and there was no shampoo, etc.   I called both housekeeping and the front desk.  Front desk offered to change my room, but I had already unpacked and didn't want to move.  I also had a nice room location (thanks to a $20 tip at check-in) and they stated they wouldn't upgrade me, only change to a different room.  Fearing they would stick me in an undesirable location, I just asked them to clean the bathroom.  Simple, and makes sense, right? Again, that was about 3:45pm.  8:30pm and the bathroom is still not cleaned.  Finally at 9:30, someone comes up to clean.  For that poor service, I give 2 stars.  Rooms are outdated with old school furniture, warn out chairs, electrical plugs which are too loose to hold a plug and a (very tiny) wetbar for which I never got the combo.  And the iron is so old that it left white lyme\/calcium (or similar) marks on my dark pants.  This resort \/ property is not a very convenient.  The gym and pool are a long walk, which I don't mind so much, but one has to trek through the casino, past restaurants and among the crowds just to go for a dip.  This resort is huge with tons of restaurants for all walks of life, shows, activities (Top Golf), and a nice casino.  They even have $10 tables!! (Which is why I give two instead of 1 star). However, I'm very disappointed in this place and will most likely never stay here, or recommend this to others.  Update:  My neighbors are pot smokers.

This review is mainly for the show.  

We got to take a picture before the show and we actually ended up buying them at the end $45 for 3 5 x 7 photos.  

The show had a nice staging and it will be hard to explaining it to someone who have not watch the show before.  I give them 5 stars for costume\/staging.  I was a little disappointed with music choice because it got so repetitive and it kinda drag.  Also, there are no stories involve so I keep hoping for betting ending but it never happen.  Talks were gibberish........no dialog what so ever and no plot.  If there was, it was not clear.

I do have positive to say however,  the staging is excellent.  The transition is amazing and all the stunts are unbelievable.  I can't imagine how the stage moved and design to see all angles and sides.  Nice part on the actors and stunt men.

There were moments that I found couple of my friends dozing off.  I thought it was just me.  For the amount if money spent.....I should of invested more on LeReve and be satisfied, I heard good reviews.

We had tickets that evening for a show at the Mirage, stayed to eat, and shop, and gamble.  $18 to park!  Just read that it is only the MGM owned hotels that are charging.

The check-in process was painless, and the front desk is just around the corner from the elevators to our room. My first time in the room was to just put my stuff down and head back to the conference area. I was able to more closely inspect the room later that night :)

The bedroom area of the room (2 queen room) was pretty nice. The beds and pillows were comfortable, enough plugs to plug in all of my chargers. The tv doesn't really match the caliber of the hotel in my opinion, but it worked and did the job. The decor of the bathroom was also a little disjunct, but it was big and nice. 

The one thing that really grinded my gears though is that I had some leftover pizza from Wolfgang Puck's that I was planning to eat the next evening. Since there are no fridges in the rooms, I left it on my desk and came back that afternoon to find it gone. Major disappointment. Either way, my standards for Vegas hotels are pretty basic since I mainly need them to sleep and shower, and the MGM did the job.",2,1,0

My primary beef is with all of the incidental charges and the lack of basic amenities. $15 per night extra to get a king instead of two queens and I sort of had to twist arms to find one at all. I wasn't even bothered by the charge until later. 

Forgot to get cash on the long drive here so had to use the ATM so I could tip the bellman, $8 ATM fee. 

Room service: a $20 sandwich and the guy asks me if I wanted to ""upgrade to fries"" for an extra $5. Seriously? Then the sandwich arrived, it was a basic club with cheap cold cuts on white bread. The quesadilla was inedible. I will post a picture. $60 for a crappy sandwich and an inedible quesadilla.

Look, I don't mind paying for a great experience, but I have had better stays in a holiday inn express. 

Let's get to the room. Despite the fact that it looks out onto what appears to be the exhaust vents of restaurants, the room is just ok. Again, just as nice as a holiday inn and express. The holiday inn at least knows what I is. 

The mattress is hard and lumpy. I always look forward to hotel beds, but this one sucks. 

In the bathroom there was one shampoo, one bar of soap, one conditioner and one lotion. No shower gel or extra bar of soap, meaning if you take the soap into the shower then there is nothing at the sink to wash your hands. You are left with a Sophie's choice of ""do I leave a soap so he can wash his hands and use up the one bottle of shampoo on my body? Or do I bring the soap into the shower and risk him being stuck within toilet hands? 

Like I said, I don't mind at all paying a premium for a premium experience, this however is far from ideal let alone premium. The room is meh, the mattress sucks, the food is horrible and there isn't enough soap for two adults to have a shower. I don't see myself ever staying here again. Just two nights. I can make it.

OK ANYWAY

I loved the MGM! Maybe I am going easy on them because we had a comped room, but I thought it was a super nice hotel, with tons of food and club options.

Lots of convenience here for sure! 

Minus one star because the vanilla smell they pump through the hotel was disgusting. I don't have a sensitive nose at all but it was seriously awful!! I couldn't imagine working there and smelling that all day! I would have to take Aleve daily to prevent a headache Lol

It is a long walk and we were hosting a couple with a room next to us.  The general upkeep and appearance of that section is old, dark, rundown and dirty.  Our room keys actually worked after several attempts.  The room was old, carpets and walls dirty.  Our guests room which was next door failed to open with the room cards.  We phoned the front desk and were put on hold.  One of the cleaners said they would call security but they failed to arrive.  Our guest ended up walking all the way back to check in after waiting 45 minutes.  Security arrived and basically the lock was broken.  They told us to come back in an hour and out cards would work.  We returned in 3 hours and nothing worked again.  We then had to walk again all  they way to check in and wait another 45 minutes only to be told they would have to move to another room which  was worse than ours.

Called every day for someone to clean the room and fresh towels. Everyday I called no one showed up to even clean the room. One day we got clean glasses. Then next day we got 2 towels. It was a joke.

Then they gave me a free room which I can use at a later time but every time I call the number to book the room for a future stay it just rings and rings for like 5 minutes and no one ever picks up. This hotel has the worst service, maid service and customer service ever. I expected a little more for the price I paid to stay at this hotel. 

Also when I was at the pool I wanted to order drinks and food but the waitress just ignored me every time I tried to ask her or wave her down. I just got up and got my own food.

I made a big mistake; a huge mistake to picked MGM.  On 2\/1, I reserved the room (they named it Skyline Marquee Suite), paid a fairly high price.  On 2\/3, I sent an email to reserve 4 tickets for the show ""KA"" in the hotel.  On 2\/5, I called in and confirmed that the tickets will be ready at the time we check in.
Finally, the day arrived and we drove to MGM with a great happy holiday mood.  We arrive at 4pm and the room was not ready.  When asked, ""Please wait around, we don't know when will it be ready but I will call you.""  Of course, there were no show tickets.  2 adults and 2 kids, we were walking around the hotel (with our bags and cases) from front desk to concierge desk to box office (each of them following a line), still no show tickets.
Finally we got into our suites.  I need some robe.  I called the housekeeping requesting 4 pairs of sleepers.  The housekeeping told me there are sleepers in the bathroom.  After seriously searching around all the 2 bathrooms while talking on the phone, I still find no sleepers.  After a lot of conversation finally I have to yell ""could you please bring us 4 pairs of sleepers anyways? 30 minutes later, the sleepers were delivered.  The sleepers are inside the robe inside the closet, not in the bathroom.

MGM has always been like a second home to me because I'm here a least once every 4 months.  This weekend however, has been one of the most horrible experiences of my Las Vegas life.  
1.  They downgraded my two bedroom suite to two connecting rooms.  I asked to speak to a manager, they no longer have supervisors or managers on site.  When you ask to speak to management they pick up the phone and have you speak with them.  Ok, you guys want to act more balsy over the phone since you don't have to face your customers? Ok, that's fine.  I've had downgrades about 3 times in my whole Las Vegas experiences, why was I ok with it then and not now? Well, each inconvenience I've been awarded food and beverage credit towards the room, free buffet, free spa, and was even awarded complimentary stay for the whole weekend without having to ask for a thing!  It was all done just to keep me, the customer, happy.  What was I offered this time?  A complimentary cancellation of my whole weekend.  The woman who I spoke with said she would grant us food and beverage credit which was never added to our room credit but even getting that credit was like pulling teeth, getting responses like ""don't let a room dictate your experience here, if I had to give food and beverage to everyone who had an inconvenience we would be broke"".  That was probably the most ignorant response from a manager I have ever heard.  Not even a 5 year old would believe that.  Or how about ""ma'am we can't control high rollers who want to stay another night we can't kick them out"" *facepalm.  What am I chopped liver?  Should I have came with my dad? Would he get more respect than I do?  Apparently so, someone at the casino even told us what really goes down at the MGM.  I wish I'd known before.  
2.  We arrived to our room and it's not even clean.  We had to call someone to come and finish the job.   
3.  The elevators.  It's not an elevator it's a moving sauna.  The hallway to the elevators was a sneak peak into how hot the elevators really were.  They were moving saunas.  No joke, EVERYONE in the elevator complained.  We joked that we were all struggling to share the air.  The whole weekend stay it was like this and we brought it up to the staff 3 times.  The bathroom of our room was also extremely stuffy, no ventilation whatsoever.  I was sweating while trying to put my makeup on.  
4.  Taxi\/valet service.  The first guy was awesome, complimented how gorgeous our group was and because I'm a platinum card holder I'm able to get priority in the taxi line, so they were able to get a limo the first night and 4 cabs the following night to dinner.  When we went out again that night after dinner everyone was excited because we didn't have to stand in that huge hour long line.  Here come mister sour puss, ""we gettin a limo?"" I tell him the girls just wanna do cabs this time and he says ""it's only 1 cab per Mlife card"".  Out of allllllllll the years I have been coming here, not once has this been an issue.  Ever.  I explained this to him and he says he would do it ""just this time"".  What it was is he was too lazy to call 4 cabs which takes you less than 5 min to do. 
5.  Went to top golf Saturday night because my husband was also in LV golfing at all the different golf courses and decided to check this place out because it's more of like a cosmic bowling experience and he didn't want to bring his golf clubs.  Coincidentally, we were at the bar talking about how horrible MGM has been and I accidentally dropped a drink on my lap.  Not much but I needed a napkin, I asked the bartender for a napkin to which he replies ""we don't have napkins"" and walks away.  I laughed, my husband laughed, we thought he was joking.  Nope, he looks at us like we are stupid for THINKING the bar would have napkins.  I see another bartender a young lady and I called her over and asked her for a napkin.  ""Sure, here ya go"" hands me a handful of napkins from the bar where I was told there were none.  I know people who read this will be like ""it's just napkins"" to me this was the last straw.  The perfect ending to a horrible weekend.
6.  Oh and we paid 60 dollars for parking.  First time ever having to pay for parking.

We were very very pleased with our stay.... We were long time Caesars guests and players, but with the decline of their properties we opted to try the MGM properties out. We are glad we did! I have always noticed that the MGM hotels and casinos kept a higher standard so we were hoping to find this true for our first stay. We were celebrating our 12th anniversary and selected a Tower Spa Suite several months in advance and booked it. I had a little correspondence with the concierge Veronica Cruz in advance as I was somewhat nervous about getting the type of room we reserved... Ms. Cruz responded quickly, kindly and professionally and took care of my concerns. I was so impressed with her punctuality and especially since I was to be a first time guest with no real gaming track record with MGM! What a great ambassador for MGM she is!  Thank you again Veronica Cruz. Once we got to he hotel there was an enormous line Sunday morning...many guests checking out. But there was cold fruit infused water stations for the guests, and staff checking with people in line and directing them to the next available desk clerk... this all looked to me like MGM actually cares about their guest...we appreciated it, and the line moved quite quickly. Once we approached the desk receptionist Marie... her bright smile and cheery demeanor immediately welcomed us. She called me by name, recognized our anniversary and had us checked in in moments...and even made sure we had just the view we wanted...she was another shining ambassador for MGM...Thanks again to Marie at the front desk!!  When we arrived to our room we found champagne waiting for us courtesy Marie and MGM !! The suite was delightful... large and light. Clean as a whistle too! All lamps and electronics worked fine as did the A\/C. Bed was exceptionally comfortable and I wanted to steal the down pillows.... they were PERFECT. I seriously want those pillows... The spa bathroom was wonderful. The bath products good as were the quantity and quality of the towels. Housekeeping came daily and did a fine job and we tipped them daily. Wifi worked fine. TV was nice with enough channels. The halls and all common areas were always clean. The common areas had a nice scent to them which I like when hotels do that.  The pool was fantastic. Plenty of seats..and yes the earlier you get there the better the selection. Loved the lazy river and variation of different pools. The drink service was fine.  The MGM features plenty of food options ranging from food court to high end more haute cuisne. We patronized the whole range believe me! There is also a nice little selection of gift, convienience shops which we also enjoyed. The location of the MGM is fine and close to NYNY, Aria, Excaliber etc...and we used the Monorail for further destinations. We enjoyed every single day of our stay... and as if the bottle of champagne we received from Marie at the the front desk wasnt kind enough... toward the end of our stay we received another anniversary gift bottle from concierge Veronica Cruz!!  I am sorry that this is so long.... I usually am not this wordy...

I was disappointed by the hotels service at every turn of my experience. My husband and I arrived on Valentine's Day to check into our hotel at 6:30pm. After waiting 20 minutes in line and then another 10 minutes for the rep to go talk to the manager, she finally informed us that our room (a celebrity spa suite) was not available. She offered to put us in a bungalow suite (TBD on whether this room was of equal or better value than what we booked and paid for), but that it wouldn't be ready for at least an hour. To her credit, she did offer us $100 credit in food\/beverage at the hotel but since I was there for a conference, most of my food was already covered either by conference meals or expensable by work. But whatever... Since we didn't have a room to change, we were forced to change in the bathroom and check our bags with the bell hop in order to get to our dinner reservation on time (which also couldn't be cancelled since it was Valentine's Day). She rep promised that they would call me once our room was ready, but 4 hours later, we still hadn't received any call, so I called them only to be told that it still wasn't ready. It was 10:30pm at that point, and I had an early morning conference to get to. After some arguing it was discovered (after being on hold for 15 min and having to wait another 10 minutes for them to call me back) that the room was ready, it just wasn't showing as ready in their system. 

So we finally get into our room at 11pm. We decide to order room service in advance for breakfast the next morning, but the phone in our room doesn't work, so I call the hotel on my cell. But they refuse to take my order since I haven't called them on an in-hotel phone. We sit on hold for several minutes while we argue with the manager (again) that all we want to do is order breakfast for the next morning and go to bed. Finally, they're able to accommodate  us, but only after they put us on hold 3 times and disconnected us twice.

Luckily in the morning the food arrived on time (15 min early, actually) and they replaced our phone. Great to finally have something go right! 

That night, we decide to order breakfast in advance again. We wait on hold for room service for 5 minutes and then the man who takes our order is rude and insists that the Grand Breakfast only comes with your choice of pork or chicken sausage OR bacon OR ham -- despite the fact that the menu states (quoting word-for-word), ""pork or chicken sausage, bacon or grilled ham"" and the night before we'd ordered pork sausage and bacon. After 15 minutes of arguing, they finally consented but insisted we were wrong and the in-room dining captain we'd ordered from the night before was wrong in giving us that. At this point, we're arguing on principle. If you only get the choice of one meat instead of two, maybe they should change the wording on the menu? 

What's the most frustrating is that throughout the entire process, I think we only heard one single apology. At every other encounter with a an employee we heard arguing and disdain. I work in customer service and know full well what a difficult job it is, but I've also learned that a sincere apology will go a long way. 

Needless to say that we'll never be staying here again an will actively recommend that our friends and co-workers (I work for an airline) stay far, far away.",11,2,0

The carpet is dirty, some slot machines were not working...the food was horrible(Except the pizza place in the Underground).

Houses many high quality restaurants and entertainment\/stores namely the Cirque du Soleil ""KA"" production, Hakkasan night club, Wet Republic and a Michelin Star(Joel Robuchon) restaurant-so there is much to do without leaving the hotel which is great and extremely convenient. Many of the top DJs also play at Hakkasan and Wet Republic so this is a very attractive perk to those interested! They also had a very nice pool with multiple pools, lazy river, lane swimming, bar and many areas where you can relax in the sunshine listening to music. Rooms were clean and well styled with a modern feel. The negatives of this hotel is that this hotel is located near the end of the strip, which meant spending money on cabs if you don't want to walk in the heat for over 10 min to the centre of the main strip. Another interesting point is that they turned off the running water right at 12pm (check out time) which meant no running faucets\/toilets-not sure if this was the hotel encouraging us to leave or if it was accidental!

My boyfriend and I were in town for Yelp Spring Break and decided to stay at the MGM one night and at another M Life partner the other two nights. What were we thinking?!? The lavishness of the rooms and VIP treatment made us feel like so special it made me wonder ""Who IS this guy (my bf)?"" We arrived at the MGM 3 hours prior to check in and were initially told a room was reserved for us but not ready yet. Shortly after a quick call and a click of a button we were told a room was available and we could head on up! Score! The room was very free and clean (without any weird scents) nicely designed and the bed and pillows were super comfy. We spent a couple hours at the pool. There were a lot of people there so it took a while to find two open seats but it was prime pool time. Staff was friendly and available if you had any questions or wanted to buy drinks. Later that night when my boyfriend and I returned to the room we were surprised to find a welcome card on a tray with a bottle of complimentary champagne, desserts and Figi water. Wow! Neither of us had ever gotten this kind of treatment before. As we stared at the tray wondering why we were delivered such an awesome welcome package we heard a knock at the door and looked at each other wondering who it could be. Housekeeping had come to deliver robes and fuzzy slippers! We felt so VIP we didn't know what to do! We've stayed at at least 5 different hotels in Vegas in the past 2 years and MGM has now become one of our favorites.

We didn't use the room much anyway, but I would have no problem paying for the accommodation again.  Hotel and casino are quite large, takes a day to find your way around but you eventually get the hang on it.  It's easy to connect to the hotels right next door and across the street (Trop, NY NY, Luxor).

We went to the pool and lazy river on two of the days we were there.  Pool was well kept and very scenic.  I'm not even much of a pool person anyway, as I don't like laying around but I even enjoyed this.  Tubes cost $16 dollars to rent. Save your money.  You can just walk the lazy river, or most of the time when people leave the pool for the day they will give their tubes away.  You can take food and drink into the pool, just no glass bottles.  We bought some sandwiches and frozen drinks and took them down to the pool as pool prices were more expensive.  There is a frozen drink stand on the walk to the pool.  You can buy the yardstick drink and take it in with you, and then take it back later for $11 refills.  Just requires a bit of extra walking.

Casino is average.  It's a casino, so it does what it is supposed to do. Entertain you and collect your money.  If you like vintage things, there is a Sigma Derby (one of only two that I think are in the city) buried in the slot machines near the sports book.  It's an old horse racing game where plastic horses race around the track and you bet quarters (yes, real quarters) on which horses will come in first and second.  It's a goofy way to spend an hour with $20 bucks if you are looking for something different or something cheap and entertaining to pass the time.

Most of the food is pricy for what it actually is.  I'm not a high end foodie, but even some of the regular sandwich shops had just average food for what they charged. Nothing that blew my socks off.  Out the back doors (red doors) of the west wing bar, there is a little market store where you can but drinks, booze to go, and snacks for your room pretty cheap.

Overall, if I ever land in Vegas again I would not hesitate at all to head back to the MGM.",1,0,0

FIRST when we checked in and went into our room there was CRUSTED BLOOD on our freakinh sheets...so the cleaning people obviously do not change sheets in between the guests which is beyond disgusting. Not to mention they failed to tell me when i booked our room that we also had to have an extra 100 bucks for the depostot along with the 25 dollar charge which i figured out.

Second it took me contacting not only the frot desk to have our nasty sheets changed and waiting about an hour, but i had to go downstairs and track down a manager to comp me for their mistake. Then checkout was a nightmare because i had to wait in line for an hour to make sure they used the $75 credit she gave me and sure enough they did not and i had to fight with the guy to removed what she had promised.

Finally the day after checkout, i checked my bank statement and an extra $50 is missing from my account on the card i only used for my deposit. I got my full deposit back and at the time the money was taken we were in a friends room getting ready for a wedding..i talked to 3 different people over the past few days and none know where this charge came from and the hotel has no record. One tried to tell me if i went to a bar or resteraunt (which not only did i not go anywhere but what do you buythat is $50 flat..) then the accounting lady which i had to wait 3 days to talk to due to the holiday, had no idea what the description even meant. Then of course, the system went down and she couldnt tell me more. So now i have to go back to the hotel and fight to get my money back!

My First time in Vegas last June, we stayed in MGM. when we arrived there, one of the check-in clerks was pretty rude ( maybe she was on her period) she made some comment and my friend ( who needs to learn to keep that NY ""IDGAF"" attitude back home) my friend started going off! way to start a vacation right, smh.

you will see why i gave it 4 stars.

after going out the first night, we come back to the hotel room and realized the there was a leak in the shower that came onto the carpet that is between the wall and the bed closest to the bathroom. called front desk and they had a bell hop come grab our luggage and take us to another room. (mind you its like 5 am) we go through employee elevators and into a room that was FILTHY! bed was made, garbage everywhere! we were pissed. so we call again, and they bring us into room #3! it seemed fine. i was wrong. the shower had a leakage and our floor was all wet in the bathroom. i went to the front desk and they told us an engineer would go fix it. and gave us 1 night off! woot woot! 

then, we went out the next night, and guess what . the faucet was leaking! and ruined all our makeup! we were beyond upset!

i went down to the manager and had a big talk about our entire experience. i didnt yell , but he can tell i was upset and it was really just RIDICULOUS. he was like ""oh im from NY too! imma hook u guys up since its your last night here"" he gave us 100 dollars room service and upgraded us to a BEAUTIFUL 2 BEDROOM SUITE WITH PANORAMIC VIEWS OF THE STRIP.

I had read on-line that this was a possibility for a fee and a long wait.  We waited about 15-20 at the concierge desk to be helped and while in line another hotel employee approached the growing crowd waiting for the concierge and asked if we had a question she could answer.  I asked about having our daughter's picture taken with a lion cub and she said that they used to do that, but that the cubs were too big now.  Disappointed we walked away and decided to go check out the adult lion exhibit.

This was my second stay at the MGM grand and I'll definitely keep coming back. This hotel has got it ALL! Amazing pool and lazy river, various dining & shopping options, entertainment, gambling, spas, easy access to the monorail, right next to the airport, clean rooms, friendly service... What more could you ask for?

THE POOLS - I think they have 4 or 5 pools (including wet republic), the main pool\/river being their best. Not too many kids around which is nice. If you plan to stay for a few days, buy the 24 oz plastic cup at the pool for cheaper refills. The cup and your first drink is $25 and refills are $18. YES, it expensive... but you're in Vegas at a legit pool, so get over it and enjoy yourself! 

THE ROOMS - Get a tower room! Easy in and out and the elevators are quick, you rarely have to wait even a minute. The rooms themselves are large, clean and the beds are heavenly. My husband had to pry me out of bed each day. TIP: Even if you get in early on your arrival day, be sure to check in when you get there. If its not a Saturday, they are likely to have your room ready early. We got there at 10am and was able to check in and head to our room! If your room isnt ready, you can still check in and your key will be activated as soon as your room is ready. There is an area to check your bags (free) and you'll get pool access too :) They make it easy for ya!

DINING\/SHOPPING - MGM Grand offers everything you need. From a quick slice of pizza to Michelin dining, they have it all! Pub food, mexican, italian, asian, buffet, seafood, etc. You wont be disappointed. I especially love Wolfgang Puck B&G which is open till 6am. Gnocchi at 4am post clubbing?!? ugh yes please! 

MONORAIL - If you haven't been to vegas you'll learn very quickly that walking places (such as from hotel to hotel) is not favorable or comfortable when its 105 degrees out. This is where the monorail comes in. MGM conveniently has a stop in the hotel (in the underground area). You can buy a one way pass, daily pass or multi day pass. I recommend getting a pass for the number of days you'll be staying. Say you want to go to Caesar's Palace... its over a mile away (25\/30 minute walk) and by cab would cost you approx. $10-13 each way. You can get an unlimited day pass for $12 on the monorail and the trains come every 7 minutes ( it runs till 2am). Granted, it doesn't take you directly to each hotel, but it gets you close enough. 

P.S. If you're there on a Thursday night you can likely get in free to Hakkasan (the night club). There are promoters offering tickets in the main lobby area.",3,1,2

they casino it's self is so enormous you really never have to leave if you don't want to....i guess that was their point. there are so many restaurants, activities, shows, bars, clubs, casino machines, lions, buffet, pools....you could make it a city on it's own! 

the rooms are so\/so, but who really cares when you're there to do stuff. on the last day of our trip i was so tired i just watched the lions for a long time. it was a nice way to detach from the loud casino noises and smoke.

Updated: Check in was easy, and the staff is courteous. You can tell that this hotel is getting older (peeling wall paper, etc.). We stayed in the Grand tower which was fine, but dark, so I can't imagine how dingy the West Wing must be.

VERY BAD DECISION!!!!!!Before arriving I was told that I had to pay $280.00 as a deposit for the hotel but I would get that back when I checked out. When arriving I was told that was just part of the fee and I would have to pay the remaining balance. Which was like 500 and something. So I paid that amount no problem. When I got off the elevator my impression of this hotel was a total disaster. The carpet was horrible and that was only the beginning. I opened the door which was filthy only to enter the room and it looked gross. The carpet was dirty, it was dark, the sink was dirty and I was totally upset. I called the front desk and they gave me another room. Only this was on a different floor. This one was even worse. The room number was slanted and it stunk in the room. At this point I was furious and wanted my money bk but was told that I couldn't get a refund because I had already checked in. So I talked to 2 different managers all which told me there was nothing they could do about it because the west wing is what I reserved. I had no idea it looked like I was staying at a motel 6. This is not what I was expecting from the mgm. So finally I just went to the front desk with all of my stuff one of the managers told me I could upgrade for an additional $30 per night for the grand towers. Reminding you that over the phone they told me it was nothing they could do. At this point I'm really still just wanting my money back. I've stayed at treasure island before and it was 10x better than this. I'm very disappointed that I spent a total of $906 dollars on my entire stay. Oh and the manager laughed at me when I told them the room looked like shit. His response was yeah it is the oldest and it was last updated in 2008. Well I was not impressed at all and I'm glad he thought it was funny. I was next to another family and they were pissed as well and they were told that there were no more rooms available but clearly that was a lie and the managers seem to like playing games with people and their money. I will never stay here again. This was the worst experience I've ever had here.

I don't regret staying here at all, but there are a few things that bugged me that will lead me to shell out some more money for a newer hotel next time I go to Vegas.

- They ran out of the room I requested, so I had to negotiate for a cheap upgrade to a suite.  I know this happens all the time, but it still pisses me off.  
- Casino is pretty smoky, not necessarily because people are actively smoking but probably because it's an older casino.  It definitely isn't as bad as others. 
- No thermostat in the room.  You could adjust the fan to ""on or off"" and ""heat or cold"".  Basically you were either hot or it was painfully dry in the room.  
- The showers in my room can't vary the level of water pressure.  Not everyone likes their water to shoot out at full speed!  I had no problem, however, with getting hot water. 
- Last, but not least, the walls are VERY VERY thin.  I could hear my neighbor's conversations.

One tip -- because the Grand is on one end of the Strip, I'd recommend buying a Monorail pass for a day w\/ unlimited rides if you know you're going to be going back and forth from the Grand to other parts of the strip.

I found American service left much to be desired in many places but every place I visited in the MGM the service was friendly and much faster!

It's at the far end of the strip but it does have a monorail stop so you can pretty easily get around if you need to.  The casino is huge and you're probably going to get lost in it the first few times you visit.  The crowd here is mixed but during summer when we stayed here it was a lot of college age kids.  It's a fun place to stay.  But it's loud.  All the time.  

We stayed in one of the suites and we had a huge room (comparable to some of The Venetian suites) and a huge bathroom.  The room had a king bed and huge windows with views of McCarren airport and the desert.  The living room area was nice enough but the only weird thing is that there was one tube tv that simply swiveled around so you could have it face the bedroom area or the living room area.  That's kind of ridiculous in this day and age and for the price you'll pay for a suite.  

The bathroom was large with lots of mirrors, a stand alone shower, and a jacuzzi tub.  We didn't have any noise complaints but our room was at the far end of the hallway away from the elevators so that could be why.  

We stayed here in July of 2010 and the pool area was so much fun.  Lots of different pools, and a lazy river.  They want you to pay to rent inner tubes or buy them but if you go down to the pool in the afternoon you can always snatch one that drunk people have left behind.  The lazy river is fun but gets kinda gross as the day goes on and starts getting littered with Bud Light lime cans.  It's kinda like being at a big frat party which is fine because you're in Vegas.

We stayed last time at the Venetian, but I chose the MGM Grand as other reviews said the pool scene was great.  Yuck.  Check in was a snarl of desks with a crowd in front of each one - no order or lines.   Rooms are a few miles away from the front desk - no problem, but the room was not right, which necessitated another trip down to the front desk crowd (to be fair I did have the option of waiting 35 minutes for a bellman)  Room rates on the website are comparable to other hotels - but when you get there, EVERYTHING but the air is $25 extra.   Add all of the charges and you not only feel ripped off but poorer.

We booked a cabana at the pool - Cabana is an optimistic idea for a little curtain and some stained furniture.  My quoted rate was a $400 minimum of food and drink - the posted rate was $600, going up to $800 on weekends.  Lackluster ordinary food was delivered by a nice waiter who also brought towels (gee, no $25 charge for those), but 7 of us found it tough to drink that much in the middle of the day.  

Breakfast was a mall style food court where we had the choice of Nathans, McDonalds, or Starbucks -  On Friday, a group of conventioneers arrived, and the hotel did not provide a separate room for their breakfast -- so they were all in line at the various breakfast venues - making the wait from 30 - 45 minutes.  

UNBELIEVABLY LOUD AND HORRIBLE MUSIC PLAYED ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE BUT IN OUR ROOMS - IN THE FOOD COURT, THE RESTAURANTS, THE POOL.    TWO DAYS LATER I AM STILL KIND OF DEAF.

Check in was fairly smooth because we have the Mlife Gold Card and had a much shorter line.  The regular line was extremely long.

Check in was very unmemorable except when we asked for a complimentary upgrade, which comes with the Gold Card, and she quickly responded with ""not for 3 nights"".  She didn't even look.   We wrote it off as she already checked before.  She also didn't really give directions to our room so we had to ask someone as we got closer to the elevators.  Even then we had to work to flag someone down as the 3 people behind the counter seemed more interested in whatever conversation they were having than helping us.  This place is HUGE so it's easy to get turned around.  Finally figured out there's only one major bank of elevators for the main towers.

Our room was a different story.  After just settling in, I notice the carpet was dirty and didn't look like it was vacuumed.  Next, the bed had hair under the pillow!  When we called to complain, they only offered to change the sheets for us.  We then noticed it didn't appear to have been dusted either.  After that, we decided to go down to the desk and ask for a different room.   

Well, we got our different room, and it was an upgraded room.  WAIT A MINUTE?!?  There wasn't any upgraded rooms available an hour ago.  Hmmmm.   This particular front desk employee was super nice and extremely apologetic.  Much better than the first one.

The new room was clean.  The upgrade was a strip view which was nice.  Turns out it's right next to the housekeeping prep room so we heard them setting up in the AM and also occasionally using the room at night.  

The USB charger port in the room was broken.  You couldn't even plug anything to charge.  Luckily I had my own power strip \/charger.  

On day 2, when we returned from a day on the strip and the thermostat was set to 85!  That's a little warm.  We tried to turn it down, but even 68 was still blowing hot air.  Another call to the front desk.  

Well they fixed it all right, this time only cool air came out.  It wasn't A\/C cool, more like the heat was turned off and just the air was coming through.  Luckily the beds kept up warm as it was down to the low 40's\/upper 30's that night.  

From a gambling perspective, if you like table games, min bet at night goes up to $25 for blackjack, $15 for others like 3 Card Poker.  The food court is nice but busy.  McD's and the Pizza place are open later.  Note these places are more like airport prices.  The pizza place was $9 for a slice and drink.   It was nice to have choices like this though.  A lot of the nicer hotels don't have 24 hour quick service restaurants.  

We did see KA which was amazing!  We also purchased a multi-day monorail pass for easy access to the center strip.  It was nice to walk across the bridge to New York, New York, and catch the tram to Mandalay Bay from the Excalibur.

It's actually one of the better mid-level properties despite some minor frustrations you might encounter.  You will get a nice comfortable room on a property where something is always happening, but with year-round specials at the premier resorts, I'd explore options before making a decision.

Pros:
Nice room, clean and comfortable
Events and attractions
Cocktail waitresses
Pool area

Cons:
Inefficient check-in system
Unsympathetic floor manager

My last MGM experience began with a sour taste, but once I got past the horribly inefficient check-in, I settled down and enjoyed some of the amenities on the property.  It would be an understatement to call the registration process chaotic - they really need to create a system that doesn't stress out the folks waiting in line.  To make things worse, the floor manager was unsympathetic and totally useless.  When they couldn't find my reservation, she told me to go to the pay-internet station and search for the reservation, myself.  She did everything to avoid offering any customer service, and did everything to redirect the blame onto me.  If a person waits in the registration line for 30-45 minutes, the least you can offer is fake sympathy.  After being unable to retrieve the reservation, she ""offered"" me the walkup non-discounted rate...not even the internet rate or any manager's special.  

The rooms are actually nice: large enough, comfortable, clean - comparable to a nice Marriott or a simpler version of the regular guest rooms at the Bellagio.  The Pool area is large and provides multiple ways to enjoy the water and plenty of spaces to layout under the sun - I'm a sucker for a lazy river.  The waitresses around the pools ignore people they assume won't be ordering, but they were good about coming by once I started a tab.  I can't speak for all of them, but the cocktail waitresses (casino floor) that served me were some of the best in Vegas - friendly, came by often, remembered drinks, and attractive.  

The MGM is a good destination for any Vegas traveler except for those expecting a little more luxury or Vegas pizzazz.  In my opinion, the MGM fits somewhere right below the premier resorts (like the Wynn) and definitely above the likes of the Monte Carlo or Luxor.  Fortunately for Vegas travelers, the premier resorts run specials that bring their price point in line with the MGM's.  Don't forget, the MGM does offer some nice alternatives with the Signature and Skylofts - both offering a better check-in experience and level of service that is missing at the MGM.  If you do end up at the MGM, don't forget to walk around and take in the sites.

A very solid Vegas resort with plenty of attractions - if you can handle the initial chaos, you can expect a nice stay.  3.5 stars for the room and property, but 1.5 stars for the service.",2,0,0

ROOM: Had a standard king room that was very large and comfy! Great value for the price.  LOVED the Jasmine scented toiletries! I can't take those that smell too strong but these were just perfect!  I had a nice strip view and at night, since the whole hotel is lighted green, it gave my room a nice green shade.  I have to agree with other reviews that the photos of dead celebrities on the wall were kinda creepy.

SERVICE:  Front desk was good (I'm in the service industry so I can be  biased).  Concierge was amazing!  I went twice and both associates were very friendly, efficient, patient and knowledgeable!  My housekeeper was great.  I left her a note along with a tip and she not only fulfilled my request but surprised me with more!

CONFERENCE CENTER: It was quite a walk from the hotel side, but hey, I guess that's just Vegas size.  All the meeting rooms I went into were in good condition (we were freezing in some, but I guess that's controllable ).  Food was decent.

ENTERTAINMENT & DINING: I liked the variety of show options available: KA by Cirque Du Soleil, a David Copperfield magic show and Crazy Horse (adult show).  I also liked the dining options: from Fancy Dandy Joel Robuchon to the typical Vegas buffet (and all in between: Starbucks, Tom Colicchio's craftsteak, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, lounges such as Tabu and Rouge, etc)

The employees at the check in and check out desk were really friendly. I arrived 30min before check in time and they told me that they were going to rush for my room to be cleaned. By the time I made it to the Grand Tower entrance I called and my room was ready.

The room was very clean and neat for having to be rushed for a cleaning. Beautiful view and at night it was pretty to leave the curtains open while the green illuminated through the room.The curtains are operated by switches. FYI the couch turns into a sleeper sofa which helps if you have extra guests. The room is dim but not terrible to where you cant stand it. The bathroom has a jet tub and a single shower.

We are here attending a convention and the convention center itself has been wonderful. It is sparkling clean, with great meeting rooms and halls. Our time at the convention is enjoyable without a doubt. But then.....

Something is incredibly amiss at the hotel. The MGM is undergoing construction and that is part of the problem This is a BIG reason to avoid this place for now. Their website attempts to gloss over this fact. It says that the MGM is getting a ""grand renovation"" and then proceeds to tell you to check out what is new. Oh how exciting!  However, it isn't the kind of excitement you want; a letter placed on your bed, informing you to expect construction noise as well as the water supply being shut off on certain days. Why are guests paying $200 a night and being checked onto a floor where the water is being shut off? This is truly a first for me. For this incredible inconvenience (which you pay for) you receive a letter thanking you in advance for understanding the difficulties of renovating this hotel. They offer you a 15% discount on a future stay....WHAT!  After checking in and being encouraged to spend an additional $15 per day to experience the ""grand renovation' experience, you get your water shut off and construction noise during the day! When I called guest services to ask for my 15% discount today, I was lectured on how unemployment is a problem and I should be glad that the hotel did not close to renovate. Can it get any more bizarre? Is there a Wizard behind a curtain spinning politically correct excuses in this Emerald City? Is this mega-million dollar corporation so greedy that it cannot absorb a few empty rooms?   How about closing one wing? How about honestly updating future guests on your website like other hotels do that there is construction going on and it may be noisy, and for this inconvenience we are offering a sale?  Is it because there is deeply planted nickel and dime antics going on? The strict mini fridge ""touch it and you own it"" rule, charging $50 per day if any personal items are found in this fridge(I guess rental fee added to $200?) , $10 fee for $80 ATM withdrawal, lack of in-room coffee maker, and mandatory resort fee of $25 per day, even though the ""resort"" pools and grounds are closed for the season, are all signs of a grand hotel where the customer comes last. Any good things about my stay? The hotel is clean and the staff is exceptionally pleasant, but one can hardly notice these things when one is staying in a hell of a renovation resort. We have 4 more days here. We will update you on whether the MGM Grand is Grand enough to discount our stay for this inconvenience of renovation,  or instead,  will be passing out complimentary construction hats.  Stay tuned, and stay away!",24,5,3

I was given a code for 2 complimentary buffets, i had to contact the hotel to figure out why they hadnt added them to my itinerary. I had to email 4 different times because everyone would just give me a run around. I show up to check in, they say theres no note of it so theres nothing they could do. 

I called to ask if they have early check in they said no. We decided to play while we make time till check in and when we arrive what do you know - people are checking in early. 

We stayed in a grand king. To a view of some type of ac system i dont really know what it was but it was ugly. Atleast we got a tiny little glimpse of the monte carlo. We were stayin in the 12th floor room 125.

The room was eh no fridge no safe no coffee machine. I dont understand how a motel has more then this place...  Then you turned on the tv watch tv for about 15 min and you'd be hit with a message ""signal lost"" try again later or wait about 5 min for the signal to come back. 

At&t carriers you might as well have been stayin in a mine there was no signal at all. 

FREE WIFI!!!! (Ya right) Make sure you read the fine print they give you 3mgps free after that, they charged you. 

Parking was one of the worst ive ever had to deal with in vegas. Definately need valet at this place cuz its horrible. Monte carlo has by far the best one. 

Tv tells you how great they are with their fast check out. you can check out from your tv just press a button. Didnt work of course. 

Bottom line. I will NEVER stay in this place again.",12,2,0

I had booked a room over the phone some time in advanced and specifically requested for a smoking room after the concierge offered a choice. When I arrived to check in I was asked if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking again, just to be told all the smoking rooms were booked but ""to make up for it"" the concierge told me he would put us close to an elevator so we could get back to the lobby to smoke. Got to the room which was indeed close to an elevator but had an unsightly view of rocks on a rooftop and green lights. 
I asked the concierge at the information desk if at any point I could switch to a smoking room and she recommended that I call during checkout the next morning to see if anything became available. 

My fiancé and I are chain smokers so we didn't spend much time in our room. At one point my fiancé forgot the card to the room and was locked out for an hour as I was asleep because he needed to go to the lobby to smoke. One staff member was kind enough to give him his phone so he could call me but I was out cold.

I called at 11 AM and nothing had opened up. I called again about an hour later and the gentleman was kind enough to offer to call as soon as a room became available. I called again a little over an hour later because we needed to meet with family and I had no intentions of spending my vacation playing the waiting game. The concierge told me there was nothing she could do for me and from what she was saying it appeared there was no note about giving me a call as soon as a room became available.

After spending time with family and touring the strip I came back to the information desk  hoping a miracle could happen and a room became available. The was a glimmer of hope as I saw her write down another room number, but after speaking with the housekeeping manager she told me nothing was available. 

I don't understand why an establishment would even offer a smoking or non-smoking option while booking the room if nothing is gonna be available. When I book a smoking room, I would hope a smoking room has been saved for me when I check in. Are those rooms just on a first come first serve basis? If so, why even tease the guest by offering it while booking the room? I also find it hard to believe that out of the several hundred people that checked out, no smoking rooms became available at any of the times I called.",0,0,0

The rooms are tiny and you can hear every little noise the neighbor makes. The hallways are weird and the placement of the rooms is odd. When we checked in one of the lights in the room was out and they had to come fix it.

The only thing I really liked about the room was the stand up shower with the dual shower heads, and the frosted glass. It's the right environment for the kinkier couples ;)

The room feels dated and biggest let down of all NO REFRIGERATOR!!!! That alone has me never coming back.

MGM Grand is definitely a place that I'll come back to in the future. Hotel staff was very friendly, lag time is short when you're waiting for the cocktail waitress (unlike at the Luxor). Rooms were very nice, comfy bed and just enough space for 2 people (petite king room). Kind of odd that for the standard room, it lacks a refrigerator. But then again I heard you get ridiculously charged for moving the in room goodies in the fridge so maybe it's better that I didn't have to worry about tampering with anything. 

Champagne brunch buffet was awesome. Great food and all the champagne or mimosa that you want. Breakfast buffet was decent, nothing too special for the price. Speaking of food, there's a ton of options here at the hotel. Sushi, fine or casual dining, quick eats and of course Starbucks. I didn't have a chance to check out the clubs, but all of the bars seem really chill and have a good vibe.

On a side note, I recommend seeing KA by Cirque de soleil while staying here. Great storytelling and the stunts and visuals were amazing. It was my first time seeing anything by Cirque de soleil so I was very impressed. Also, you can usually get complimentary tickets depending on your package deal. Doing some research while planning a vegas trip can save you a lot of money and you can get some pretty sweet deals. FYI, there's a $25 per night resort fee that's usually not included in hotel and flight packages.

Overall this was a great hotel. Only cons for me was that fat Tuesdays was closed for remodeling, the lion habitat is either gone or is also being remodeled (construction on the west wing), and for some reason the tv in the room constantly loses signal. It's not like I'm in vegas just to watch tv anyways, but I enjoy seeing national and sports news while getting ready in the morning. Other than that, I would highly recommend staying here.

Of course, when I tell people about my experience here and yes I have been talking they are all shocked that its the MGM & thats what I thought too. The world famous MGM Grand where boxing legends and celebs hang out, where the experience should be amazing. WRONG! 

I had two agendas on a recent trip to vegas. One, view meeting space for an upcoming conference that I am planning and attend an engagement dinner. The couple was planning to marry in Vegas so hey I could refer them to MGM Grand after my tour. 

I checked in on my phone so when I got to the hotel it was a breeze. However, once I got in the hotel discovered there was no remote (go back to my agenda, I planned to relax) I called they couldn't believe there wasnt a remote, came to check themselves, then broke back a remote. 

Day two, we are still on Ohio time woke up at 5am to watch the soccer match TV isn't working, tech came, couldnt fix the issue so we don't have tv for hours. In this case I wish I had brought a book. 

So, we decide to dress and hit the strip. Well, the hot water isn't working. I call the tech comes and he tells us the trick to the hot water. At the world famous MGM Grand there is a trick to the hot water??? He shows us the trick and walah we have hot water. 

The hot water trick, if anyone is interested is to turn the sink water on hot 1st for 60 seconds then the tub water let them both run then hot water!! 

Day Three, I figure the hot water trick out all by myself and we hit the strip for shopping. When we get back the room the isn't clean!! No fresh towels & the bed isn't made. I call, they send someone she asks us to leave while she cleans, I decline. During the evening of day three we cant figure out the hot water trick for awhile, finally we leave the faucet sink on by it self, cut it off then try the tub & walah. We are magicians at this point. 

Day four, we cant figure the hot trick out but its check out so we decide to just cold shower, because clearly we lost our magic touch. I have a great tour of the property with Aram, he is very nice and treats me to breakfast. I learned about his family and it was a great experience. He had gave me new hope for MGM. 

I checked out on the TV, which was pretty cool. Check my credit card & notice I have a weird charge it says something like ""mail order purchase"" I assume its MGM but call amex to double check, they say its MGM but the charge is larger than should be so I go to front desk and ask for a manger she says its not MGM, call amex again they say it is. Are you dizzy because I was. Finally, I say forget because at this point I am back over MGM (sorry Aram) 

I am in Vegas quite often, I was just there in October and came back November and plan to be back in the next month or so because I am still planning a conference. It is terrible as famous as this hotel is and highly recommended it is I had such a terrible experience. The manager offered no empathy she was total blah to my concerns as if this happens all the time. I expected more but got less than anyone deserves. 

So, you guessed you not recommended this hotel to anyone...",4,2,2

We typically like mid-strip so this was a bit far down for us but ok for the 2 nights we stayed. The only downfall is the size of the hotel, it is huge so you have to walk a long way to get anywhere although Grand tower wasn't bad. Cable went out a few times but not for long. Also, be prepared as Valet takes a LONG time to get your car. Bell desk was amazing and prompt.

1. Room: Our room was on the 3rd floor. The halls of the West Wing were the longest, thinnest hallways I have ever seen. This is the oldest part of the hotel and are part of the original that MGM was built around and it definatly showed. You could see NOTHING out our window and the room was 350 square feet. After 1am the shower in the room would NOT run hot water. The sink was so small you could not even run it enough to splash your face. There was hair in the shower stall and the phone was covered in grime. There was a gigantic splash of something on the roman blind which I try not to think about to much. There were burn holes in the carpet. The Bed was the saving grace of the room - very comfortable and there was an extra pillow.
2. Buffet: Vegas is known for their Buffets. MGM was 30\/person for Dinner and it was very disappointing. The food was no better than a Golden Corral - In fact the food at Golden Corral is BETTER and HOT! There were supposed to be crab legs but all they ever had was the pot of water to put them in. we were there over an hour and they didn't even cook any until we were leaving. Waste of Money - the food in general was overpriced at every restaraunt and better was found at other hotels [Circus Circus for Steak and New York New York for 800 degree Pizza]
The best parts were as followed: I will probably review seperately....
3. Grand Spa - 25\/day or 60 3-day pass....Jacuzi, hot sauna, dry sauna - wonderful locker and shower rooms with everything provided... this was the BEST part of my stay [see other review]
4. TopGolf - Driving Range at the far end of the hotel - Shuttle provided [see other review]

Ka did not preform while we were there - apparently they do not perform Thursday or Friday [WHAT]

Calling the front desk for assistance was a bust. I called about the best way to get to TopGolf and they told be to find a bus or attempt the walk. FYI: TopGolf has a Lounge - Right in the LOBBY!!!! A shuttle leave every hour on the hour and every 20 minutes.

While a lot in the Hotel was Expensive - $5 water, No coffee pot in room etc. There was a shop right outside the hotel that said Grand Canyon - Souveniers were Cheap [Hats 2\/9.98 Shot glasses 2\/2.98 etc] and Water 2\/1.00]

We walked over here from Bally's, which wasn't really that far.  I didn't really read much about the MGM before we came and had no idea how big the hotel\/casino were!  My goodness, it was really overwhelming!  We actually got lost trying to get out of the casino back to the strip.  

We checked into a Celebrity Spa Suite for our one night at the hotel.  The room was very spacious and decorated well. The Gustav Klimt prints and the bronze wallpaper were sophisticated embellishments. Our view of the East and the airport was magnificent, night and day.  

I'm going to be honest, we got the room for the hot tub and we were not disappointed.  However, I was worried about slipping while getting in and out of the tub.  We didn't, but I wish there were steps or a better railing to help get into the tub.  

For the price, we got a great room.  The MGM is a really neat hotel.  I was not really impressed with the lion habitat and I liked the location of Bally's better (because it was located in the middle of the strip).  But I would come back because the hotel is truly grand and I love Vegas!",1,0,0

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of ""#1 Nightclub in the World"" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas\/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

.  
1. Pool- We floated the lazy river.  My husband and I are twenty somethings and expected a ""normal""  (adult) vegas pool.  The lazy river  felt identical to a KIDS WATER PARK.  They shuffle you through like cattle (kids), and send you on your way.  The only restaurant at the lazy river is kiddie park style... you wait in a line of metal aisles, place your order at the window and wait for your number.  The ""pool bar"" is the same way.  Next come the pool lockers!  I'll admit, they were very handy when you get to the river and realize, ""why did I bring my purse, I'm floating a river and won't be in the pool right next to my belongings that I can keep an eye on all day"".  Thank God for the lockers.  They are in broad daylight- not in the back of some wet room, so they were in great view of everyone and I trusted no one would break in.  Next come the TUBES!  Tube rental to float the river was a ridiculous $16.00\/each.  I will say there was AMPLE seating- no one wants to hunt for a layout chair or place to eat!  Especially when you're walking around in wedge heels and a bikini trying to suck in and look good.  Lots of seating (+)!  The river itself is pretty narrow.  This wouldn't be a problem if 3\/4 of the crowd weren't using it as a pool and parked on the sides.  We just bumped into everyone, but we didn't care.  What we did care about were the kids.... I've never seen so many kids at a Vegas pool in my life... with their mom... on an apparent girls weekend and didn't care if her 7 year old intentionally kicked and splashed everyone.  Bummer :(.  Babies in floats coming by you, kids diving for rings... I. Am. Not. Kidding.  In Vegas in September, I expect to spent majority of my time at the pool, and I will definitely not be back to this one.  

PROS:
1.Poolside drink service was AWESOME!! They have servers all over and get your drinks quickly.
2. You can drink in the pool!! Some hotels these days (ahem, ARIA!) won't even let you get 2 feet near the pool with a drink.  They provided clear plastic cups and we were set.  

CONS
1. Kids :(
2. Felt like we were at disney world, but I guess MGM never claimed to be a high end luxory hotel
3. Someone pooped in the pool... or vomitted...r so we heard- first came the life guards yelling, then came everyone rushing out of the pool, which was closed for the rest of the day.  Is it weird that this is not the first time I've witnessed this in Vegas??

2. Shopping-Do not expect to find anything nicer than Forever 21 clothes in MGM.  Cheap glitter dresses and plastic heels are about all you'll find.  Oh and Ed Hardy hats :)

3. Sports Book- we were in the sports book are for about 4 hours watching football.  Seating is a 4 on my scale, it was packed, you had to fight for a seat.  Cocktail servers were BEYOND terrible- that's why we ended up leaving.  $2,000 bet and you get 2 free drink tickets.  Not right if you ask me, but that's the rules.  SO here we are PAYING for drinks, and the service was awful. End of story.

3. Restaurants- MGM's only saving grace!!  PLENTY of dining options and they are all beautiful appointed.  We ate a Craftsteak which is awesome.  Also, dine at Diego which is HIGHLY underrated! The best Tex-Mex i've ever had. Really wish we could have tried out Shibuya sushi!

Point being- I will only revisit MGM for a meal.",1,0,0

I did not go to fancy hotels growing up. But when I moved to Richardson\/Dallas TX with a swank job I developed an obsession with the MGM Grand. At least 40 visits here. Because it always stays miles ahead of the competition. Correction....no competition.

The 360 Degree remodel in 2013 was an overwhelming success! This resort has had a few minor sprucing up remodels, but this was tearing every inch of the US largest hotel to the rafters and re-inventing opulence, excitement and TRUE luxury! They highest paid architects kept the great stuff and replaced everything else.

The guest rooms and suites already looked new but with an MGM Grand Studio slant such as movie photos. The rooms and suites were rebuilt with an eye towards, comfort, style, efficiency and modern design.

The modern artwork throughout the resort slows down any trip to your room. Thousands and thousands of large designer prints and posters.

New restaurants such as TAP are phenomenal and less expensive than leaving the resort. Why bother when everything is already at the ""City Of Entertainment""? at a fraction of the cost of off strip options?

The planners did an incredible job of maximizing room space! Just right sized closets. Wildly beautiful and cosseting bathrooms with customer comfort and space in mind.

The beds!

Monorail access is the most convenient on the strip. No walking miles. Two entrances and deep discounts!

Adult libations so vast you could indulge in one every week and never visit the same one twice. I especially love Centrifuge!

Good looking staff! Don't laugh! Everyone enjoys a hot looking young man delivering your luggage.

The largest abundance of dining options under one roof in the world! Even the food-court was refurbished. Clean, multiple options and terrific lighting effects. No one in Vegas gets this right. The MGM Grand does.

Great slot payout! I won $1,000 my first night recently! Wheel Of Fortune.

Stellar cocktail service! Be sure to tip GENEROUSLY all staff members. It is how they earn an income.

WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

My fault but lost my wallet and spent hours talking to over a dozen staff members. I was so humiliated and embarrassed I took a shuttle back to the airport to leave the same day after all the angst. The Players Club even printed my Photo Drivers License. I was going to be sleeping on a park bench, but a kind lady at SupperShuttle had the safe opened and I was able to check in. But again - I was crying and humiliated and just wanted to go home after the MGM policies but it turned out well. Resort fees were comped, and I even booked an additional night and now a stay in June.

Room Tip: Book through VIP Marketing. Be specific.",21,13,17

Came back this year with the BF with a VIP Host--everything was AWESOME. They know your name when you call for room service. They tell you room service will take 45 minutes--you tell them you're heading out to dinner in an hour. 10 minutes later--champagne in hand = a happy girl. They gave us a Terrace Suites - two-story vaulted ceilings and outdoor patio overlooking the strip. Its like staying in mini condo but better! The dining area, living room, a bathroom, and the outdoor patio is downstairs then you go up this big spiral stair case that takes you up to the master bedroom with a huge master bathroom that is way bigger than the actual bedroom. I could live here forever and you would never hear a complaint from me! : ) The VIP host did an awesome job bc she got us the best seats in the house for all the shows--right smack in the middle up front (close enough to get a view of the entire stage but not too close where your neck will hurt from looking up).

For our purposes, it was really just as good as Caesar's and it's much cheaper.  The only really undesirable thing is the location, but that can be mitigated by using the monorail.  It's also not a big deal if you've been to Vegas and don't feel the need to walk up and down and see all the hotels on the strip, because there's more than enough to do in the hotel between the attractions on StudioWalk and the pool complex.   

MGM is really awesome in terms of having things to actually DO in the hotel.  I didn't realize how important this in until staying in Caesar's, which is a beautiful hotel but really has nothing to do in it.   MGM has both the lion habitat and Television City, which are both fun for kids or families (or even for adults who don't really drink or gamble).    There's also tons of cheaper food options, including a whole food court with fast food (Haagen Dazs, McDonalds, Nathans, etc), 'Wichcraft, Rainforest Cafe, Studio Cafe, etc, which is really nice because you don't have to leave the hotel every time you don't feel like dropping $25+ for a meal.",2,0,1

Maybe I'm weird, but I loved their hotel linens; they didn't make me wake up in the middle of the night sweating, even with the pillowtops.

+ $35 credit on each room for the food court, not applicable at Emeril's restaurant, etc. But it WAS valid at Wolfgang Puck's, and their burgers were amaaazing. I think we devoured 3 in total. 
+ The staff, specifically the guards, were so nice. So nice, in fact, they were borderline baby-talking to me. This is referring to when I fainted waiting for food at Wolfgang's from possible shock of the heat outside and cold inside. Who knows.
- Wet Republic: maybe it's fun when it's sunny and there are actual DJs spinning, but I would have no idea bc the weekend I went was rainy and the pools were closed for a good while due to lightning. Literally rained on our parade.
? Casino: like any other.
+ (Multiple) Pools: plenty of lounge chairs, and you can bring in your own booze provided the cans are emptied into cups. Tip: buy plastic sports bottles and fill it up before you get to the pool for additional alcohol.

My favorites are Fiamma's Italian restaurant and Original Chicken Tender in their food court. Feels like every time i come there is a different show, but currently its Jabbawokeez, David Copperfield, Brad Garrett's Comedy Club, and KA Cirque du Soleil. During the warm season they have Wet Republic, which is an outdoor day club. Pretty fun but you have to be in the water to survive the heat.

Each time one of our friends checked in, I would have to go downstairs to correct the billing which took close to an hour.

ROOMS

We were in the west wing. Out of the 6 days we were here, we never had our room cleaned once, despite asking for it to be cleaned several times. I called down to tell them that our room had never been cleaned and to send up 5 towels. The lady responded with - the maximum is 4. That's great, but there's 5 of us, who all paid to be in this 6 person suite so we need 5. I argued with her for 5 mins to be able to get one extra towel. ON top of that when they brought up towels there was a manager in the hall and I told her that our room had not been cleaned ONCE and we had been there 3 days. She made a note and did nothing, still for the remaining 3 days they never cleaned it once. The hotel overall is nice, but compared to Aria and hardrock which I have also stayed at I do prefer the cleanliness of their hotels better. Our showers were both practically broken, our mirrors were rusted, and we had to throw our garbage and dirty towels into the hall for them to be actually removed from our room and someone to clean it up. Final remarks: go anywhere else where you will actually get the service you deserve for your money. 

POOLS

The pools had a nice vibe however the pool chairs are made out of a dark brown almost black rubber. Obviously they are very old because this concept is idiotic, we all literally burned our asses on these chairs. Not joking, like I had to put aloe on my ass. 

RESTAURANTS

I'm not a fast food person and that's mostly what they had. Yes they had a few restaurants, italian, asian, steak, none of them had really healthy options and I felt sick the whole week from the lack of better food options. 

CASINO\/LOUNGES

The casino isn't as fancy as other casinos in Vegas and the lounges were OK. Overall there was a good vibe going around, the crowd is mostly younger. I would say 20s to 30s.

My dad usually gets a skyline marquee suite for us as a family and it's a pretty big suite that gives a family of 6 decent room to run around and have our own space (except bedtime then it gets crowded). The dinner table was huge and the seating area was decent. We could clearly see outside as the windows were huge and lit up the place during daytime. The lighting is great at night and isn't too bright and has that perfect light especially if you're drunk. You can have the lights as bright as day but who the heck does that in Vegas. You're not supposed to be reading books while in Vegas, you know what I mean? It was pretty great staying here and we all felt like VIPs as we lounged around.

The suite has two rooms, each across the suite. My parents and the youngest shared the bigger one and the rest of us three shared the other. My sister and I were on the bed and the other one had to have a bed ordered for herself.

We stayed here for three nights and my younger siblings enjoyed exploring around the hotel. We had to pay for the internet connection by the day and I think it was $14 per day. The service everywhere was good. Valet was decent, checking in was fast enough, bellman did his job, cleaning ladies were good, and the room service was pretty quick to get us our food. Everything was pricey but hey, it's Vegas.

The restaurants we tried downstairs in the hotel had very good sushi and drinks. Pricey again and we all dressed up with cocktail dresses and suits. Great service and attentive staff. The restaurants looked very upscale and most everyone was dressed up at dinner.

After dinner, we tried the clubs in the hotel. There were people around handing out free ""passes"" to women who look like they're dressed up for clubbing. The clubs were decent with good tunes and good fun vibes mostly. We went to a club that was kinda lame but the crowd was just a tad bit younger but who knows, it was pretty dark in there. We went to another club that seemed more fun and had good tunes to dance to. There were a lot of middle aged guys clearly trying to get laid but most were failing miserably. There were some middle aged women who were also trying to get laid and had a good possibility despite acting like nasty skanks. It was fun except my dad made it awkward by getting us a table service and dancing with my parents isn't exactly what I had in mind when I think Vegas. He bought a cheap tequila bottle and it really sucked to drink it. I don't remember what tequila it was but it was like drinking rubbing alcohol (probably was). I felt that I had to be drunk to drink it if you know what I mean.

I've also checked out Crazy Horse Paris here, which was decent. See my review ;-)  Otherwise, like others have said, the hotel is pretty standard with its casinos and restaurants.

Check in was quick and painless (service overall in the hotel was very good), and the room was ready when we arrived at 2:30PM. Room itself was pretty nice. The recent renovations certainly give an air of newness to the room, and nothing looked run down or gross. One of the towels did have a yellow stain on them. That towel went straight to the floor.

Casino is decent, and I was asked if I wanted a drink consistently whenever I decided to start losing money, so that's good.

However, being awoken from 6-8am in the morning by trucks beeping and dumping things is no bueno. I mentioned it at check out and they comped me the resort fee, which was nice, but bad sleep is one of my big pet peeves, so I'm actually being nice by not giving them 1 star, haha.

Their pool facilities are actually pretty grand. The lazy river is cool, but the opposite of lazy. Lots of young 20s something getting drunk and rowdy. Definitely a younger place. They do have other pools, some designated for family, for water volleyball, and for lounging. Definitely something for everybody.

I appreciated that it was both dark and quiet... these are very important qualities for hotel rooms in Las Vegas as you'll want to be able to sleep at any hour of the day or night.

We also had a nice view up on the 23rd floor... it was kind of a pain waiting for the elevator every time we wanted to go up and down, but once there the view was nice.

The decor was Old Hollywood themed... pictures of old stars, etc. The theme was not over the top though.

The pool, as you'll read in a separate review, is AWESOME.

The only reason this place is not getting five stars is that the casino is an absolute MAZE... it drove me crazy to try to walk from my room to the pool and back. I mean, like, *CRAZY.*",1,0,0

I loved the room, we got the spa king, very spacious with excellent views of New York New York, Monte Carlo and City Center. The restaurants were awesome, food was excellent. Now lets get to the bad part. Prices for bottled water and other things at the small shops by the elevators are insane. $9 for a smart water, even after the MLife discount, which is a joke. Bring a case of water up to your room or visit one of the local CVS stores on the strip to buy water, don't waste your money. Souvenirs were expensive as well, $20 for a plastic gold painted lion that probably cost them 50 cents to make in China. Look, I know they have to make money but c'mon, that's crazy expensive. Gambling in the casino was just okay, as with all casinos it was a smokers paradise. The MGM seems to have a bad ventilation system because out of all the casinos we visited, the MGM seemed to smell the worst. If you're a non smoker, be prepared. You'll be coughing for weeks after visiting the MGM. The roulette and black jack dealers were okay, most were nice however I did run into a couple that were rude. Didn't smile, didn't make eye contact, sort of makes you feel like you're forcing them to make you have a good time or something....my assumption was if you work in entertainment, whether that's being a dealer or a actual entertainer, you're supposed to put on a happy face and make the customer feel welcomed. These dealers seemed like they hated life and just wanted to leave. I didn't bother tipping any of them. I'm glad I walked over to the New York, New York, the dealers there were very friendly, talkative, really had a great time there. A couple days into my stay we visited the pool, it was just okay. Most of the places where you could sit and relax were covered in bird poop. I had to turn over the cushions on the metal chairs just to sit down. Even still I couldn't lean back because bird poop was all over the chair. I was irritated that the lazy river opens at 10am rather then 8am like the rest of the pool. We had to stand in a huge line of about 50 people waiting to get into the lazy river before it opened. Then burst into the complex like a black Friday sale just to get a good chair. Absolutely insane. This isn't vacation to me, that's stressful. The drinks at the pool bars were reasonably priced and discounts given after your first drink. Our pool experience was ruined when someone first threw up in the lazy river which resulted in the life guards forcing everyone out and closing it down for two hours and then thirty minutes later someone pooping in the river, again closing it for two hours. There has got to be a way to prevent this. Maybe like not serving food at the pool? Duh. When we were allowed to get back in the water it reeked of chlorine and when I undressed in my room later that day, I found out my swim trunks had changed color. GROSS. Lastly, there are way too many people allowed into the river at once, you basically cannot swim comfortably. Fights were breaking out, a guy pushed me and my raft for no reason. It wasn't fun. On my last night at the MGM, upon walking to my room, as soon as I entered the hallway, I was bombarded with the smell of Marijuana. Now it was my understanding that my floor was non smoking, which it was and that consuming illegal substances in public hotels was not allowed? I guess not. I called security, they never came and I had to put up with the bad small all night which I thought was unfair. Thankfully I don't have any job interviews or drug tests to do, because THC is probably still in my system thanks to the second hand exposer. My thoughts about the MGM are its simply a party paradise for young, reckless, alcoholic kids. Its not for respectable, people with manners and relaxation in mind. Ya know. A vacation.....I won't be staying here again.",0,1,0

A big heads up when parking in their structure is to remember exactly where you parked. It could get kind of confusing and you may get lost. Checking in was really quick and rooms are pretty spacious. One of the biggest downers was that when we made room reservations online the website said we would have free buffet tickets. When my husband went to check in the girl at the front desk said she had no indication of that special on the system. She stated that if there was something on the confirmation email or if we have proof she could give it to us. I was totally bummed even though my husband screenshot it on his ipad from the website we didn't decide to pursue it. We kind of forgot about it. Still a big let down though.

The room was pretty spacious but the television was a little dated. One of the big things I look for in a hotel room is a flat screen and this television was a little old school. The room was fairly clean minus the pillow with ""stains"" on it. Yes, I know. I have watched all those little news specials about how disgustingly dirty 5 star hotel rooms are and how many stains are on the walls and comforters using a blacklight. The only thing is I didn't have a blacklight and the stains were just there. Mind you it was only the decoration pillow but it was pressed up against the pillows we were supposed to sleep on. I threw it on the side of the room and opted to not have the room service clean so they don't put it back on the bed. Aside from that the bed was amazing and I had the best sleep there on my vacation.

The hotel is location is pretty good too especially if you are driving since its more toward the beginning of the strip. There's lots of restaurants and lounges in the hotel that you can choose from but the hotel is currently under some renovation. You can also walk next door to New York New York or to the other nearby hotels. Great thing is that it is located at the beginning of the monorail if you want to blow $15 bucks for an all day pass to use the monorail on the strip. Overall good experience for the price.",0,0,0

I was attending a conference at the hotel. From my room to the conference center walking at a pretty brisk pace took 9 minutes. There is a soda machine and an ice machine on each floor. Sodas (or water) is $3.00 a bottle, but don't worry, the machine takes credit cards!

I left about 3 years ago to stay at other hotels for a lot of reasons. We are gamblers and have never had to pay for our room or meals. So this review is to help management and those who have never stayed there. The rooms have been remodeled and new bedding. 
Even though the temperature out side never got above 100 before memorial day. The room never cooled off enough to sleep under the covers. We had to keep the black out down to keep out some of the heat. 
The provided refrigerator was full of things that were way over priced. and had a $50.00 restocking charge? I wondered if I took a bottle of water if it was going to cost me $58.00?. 
I ran my hand over the top of the mirror in the bath and dust poured down. I let it hang for a week and it never went away. Not a lot of attention to detail for a high end resort. The ceiling above to sink had stains and  built up grime. 
    The pillows were very big and hard. We called and received smaller pillows that were low quality foam. 
    Everything at the hotel is way overpriced for what you get. It was a holiday weekend so I expected a crowd. The problem is the layout of the hotel and surrounding area cannot handle the traffic. The valet was a really long wait, as much as twenty minutes  as was the taxis.  Bringing our car back from an outing we had to wait to just get to the valet drop off. 
Lines to all of the food service was really long. Lines to everything was to long. When the foot traffic was slower, there were less people to serve you. So if you wait for off peak hours you don't save a lot of time because the staff has been cut down. We had a lot of room service so we didn't have to stand in line for 45 minutes to an hour. Room service was faster and pretty good for the price by comparison. 
We had VIP passes that allowed us to go to the head of the lines and that earned us a lot of stares that were not friendly. We chose not to use the passes because it made us feel uncomfortable. I really don't think I will stay there again even though I have made friends over the years with a lot of the staff in the gaming area. 5034 rooms plus convention and concerts are to much for the floor plan. I was knocked down in the restroom. Bumped into countless time by drunks. Stepped on in the crush of the people running . 
     Cost is not a factor for us, but I come from humble roots and even though I have the means to pay for anything I want. I will not be robbed in the name of a resort. I don't see MGM lowering their prices because they have a line waiting to pay.

The check in line was extremely long, however, my mother is wheelchair bound and the concierge immediately approached us to come to another window to be assisted for check in.  Although, we wouldn't mind to have waited with everyone else, we appreciated the extra help.

When we got to our room, we were pleased with the size of the room.  There were two televisions, two telephones, automatic window shades, a nice huge big bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub, two sinks, marble bathroom floors.  The part of the room that was carpet was disappointing.  The carpet needed to be cleaned, as it was dirty.

We decided to get ready and hit the city...we proceeded to the lobby and w-a-l-k-e-d all around the hotel to find our spot to gamble. Although, we didn't win millions, we had a good time. With many people smoking, it wasn't apparent. The fresh\/scent in the air made the gambling area pleasant. 

The kids decided to hit ""The Lazy River"" and immediately were disappointed, as there is a fee for getting an inner tube.  

Since there is a daily Resort fee ($25.00), this fee should cover the inner tube cost. Oh, you do get a ""free"" inner tube when you pay for a cabana...for a ridiculous fee!

When we got up and out of the room for the day at 9:00 AM,  we made sure to take the ""Recharging IN Progress"" off the door, so the maid could clean our room.  When we returned at 4:00 PM, to get ready for the evening our room still wasn't cleaned.  I'm not sure what time the room was cleaned, as we didn't return until 12:30AM.  When I woke up in the middle of the night, I could not see the clock from the bed, as it is on top of the telephone facing towards the ceiling.

We were really disappointed upon our return to the room, as we had left overs and when we opened the refrigerator, there was no place to put the food.  The refrigerator was already stocked by the hotel with drinks.  If one of us moved any items, there would be a re-stock fee!

We had to use the pull out couch and it was apparent that since the couch was placed there, it has not been vacuumed underneath.  There was enough trash, if or when cleaned it would take up a trash can.

The next day, we stopped by Starbucks for our morning coffee, as there is not a coffee pot in the room.  I saw one of the hotel employees and asked if there was a comment card.  I was told ""we don't have those, and I could speak to a manager.""  This is why I am leaving my comments on Yelp. 

CONS:
No coffee pot
No inner tube, should be part of ""Resort fee""
Too long to service room
Carpet needs to be cleaned
Carpet under pull out bed extremely dirty with trash
No additional refrigerator for personal use
Clock unable to see when in bed
Lion  Exhibit closed and lions moved to an offsite, where you have to pay a fee to see them.)

Everyone knows when you come to Vegas you're going to ingest far more calories and bad-for-you food & drinks than you would ever intend to. So its probably a good idea to have a plan to at least control the damage. For me, that means I need a gym.

When I booked my stay at MGM Grand they told me there was a gym. That is not completely true. There is a CARDIO ROOM. That means a couple of treadmills and bikes. NO WEIGHTS. NO MACHINES. Nothing to get an actual weight lifting style workout.

So I went to the front desk when I realized this and asked if there was a ""real gym"". There is - unfortunately its part of the grand spa. Which means you have to pay extra. $10 per day. What the heck? Seriously? Oh yes - after all the room costs, crazy food & drink prices, resort fees, etc. - they want more. They want more money for you to use a gym like just about every other hotel offers for free. Hope you're listening MGM - your fitness center should be free!

I won't get further into it, but I'll definitely say that I'm totally upset about this and will never stay here again simply because they don't have a free (""real"") gym or fitness center to use. If I want cardio I'll go swim in one of the 4 pools.",0,1,0

As a gift, my mother was going to add a $200 credit to our room, and since the room was paid for already, would be given back to us as cash. The MGM has you fill out a credit authorization form, fax it to their offices, then wait for an hour to see if the credit has been applied. We went through this literally 4 TIMES! each time there was some issue with the fax.. they NEVER called to let us know of an issue, we always had to call and check the status of our credit. Each time we called, we spoke with someone new.. had to remain on hold while they tried to figure out what we were talking about, etc.. it was just too much going on. On the 2nd day of our trip, my husband and I decided to go down to the business center and get this straight. My poor mother was trying to give us a gift, and was getting frustrated! it literally took them 5 minutes to issue the credit, but we couldn't get cash! We had to spend the credit in their hotel on a MGM gift card! WOW... 
This place is beautiful, however it may be TOO big. For such a small thing as a credit to your hotel room that took 5 minutes to do.. there were too many hands in the pot. No reason for that to take 24 hours.

Will never stay here again......i dont think.

Positive:
- Large Suite with nice spa. Great layout, looked amazing,
- Great vibe, so much to do and see.
- Great price on room.
- Customer Service was willing to remove charges, add credits to try and make up for wrongs.


Negative: ( I really am sad i had so many problems, i wanted to love this place)

- TV didnt work at all for two days. Day three it kind of worked after we changed rooms.
- Drain fulled room with the smell of RAW SEWAGE.
- Sink water leaked straight threw onto our feet in bathroom, like a major leak, not just drips. 
- Room 5-140 is right over the loading dock and trash compactor. 24 hours of 18 wheeler beeping, honking, dumpsters being compressed and taken out. So so loud all day, all night.

- Had to change rooms, but had to wait half a day just to be downgraded from our spa suite since NOTHING WORKED!

- NOTHING WORKED, I mean, nothing. looked good but drains don't drain, TV doesn't work, sinks leak, noise is loud, phone was broken........and its a resort!

THE STORY: (its a great bad story.)

Of course we are suckers and already had a major delay with our one hour Spirit Airline. (don't ever use them)
 
First night no TV, trash compactors and Dumpster and 18 wheeler's unloading\/ loading all night, honk, honk!

Second day: Sewage smell coming out of the upgraded spa suite. Sink water leaks straight onto your feet threw the huge hole in the sink fittings. TV hasn't worked in 48 hours, even after changing rooms to a lower grade suite. Dumpster and 18 wheeler's unloading\/ loading all night. LOUD 

Third day: couldn't take the trucks, TV and fear to use anything with water we needed a different room. Took about 4 hours and a lot of phone calls but we did move into another suite, but it has no spa upgrade. which was fine since we didn't have a great time in the other one since it smelled like RAW SEWAGE!

In my second room at the hotel mid day trying to relax and watch a movie with my wife and we can't because they can't make the TV work.......and they call this a resort? Bullshit, this place really ruined the idea of the possibility of a relaxing vacations.

Oh and I must type this on my phone because they can't get there internet working either. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!

They waived the ridiculous resort fees for the whole stay and gave us a $75 room credit which was a good attempt to right the wrongs but it was far from enough because when you have the limited time like we do and spend such a long time saving up for those few days you get to go on vacation issues like the ones we had are just simply unacceptable and none repairable.

The sofa was a big sectional and was SO comfortable with tons of pillows and situated in front of a giant flatscreen and music docks, etc. The pool table was an awesome addition, as well. There was a seating area around a table for about 6 people, very nice furnishings with white leather seats. Also, there was a desk area with another chair to do some ""business"" but we didn't need to use it. Our kitchenette\/bar had plenty of storage on the counter, with well-appointment glassware, a jigger, martini shaker, bottle opener, and another giant flatscreen above it. Only complaint was that they locked the mini fridge because we didn't want to use their food\/drinks (since we brought so much of our own) but that meant we had to keep replenishing our coolers with ice from the far away ice maker. We saw a mini fridge being delivered to another room, but I guess there was miscommunication and we didn't order one...but next time we know!

Our two bathrooms had amazing products from Bulgari, plenty of fluffy towels, and we found comfy robes and slippers in the nicely sized closet. The room that I shared with a friend had a corner view and amazing blackout curtains for those hangover kind of mornings, a nice wardrobe of drawers for folded clothes, a giant flatscreen tv, and a king-size bed was SO comfortable we didn't want to get out of it! we were provided with tons of pillows and extra towels with no problem! Many hotels I've stayed at before were cheap with linens, but MGM has very nice towels and linens- I was impressed. The room was a generous size and very clean. The bathroom adjoined to our room also had a door to the living room. It was HUGE with a full bath\/shower combo, another walk in shower with a glass door, and a HUGE vanity with two sinks and PLENTY of room and storage for all of our girly products. The lighting was also perfect. 

I drunkenly ordered room service at 3am on Thursday night of our stay (make sure to eat dinner before you go clubbing and have bottle service- whoops) and the burger I got was worth every penny, although it was huge and I only ate half. It came with fries which were delicious, too! I ordered ranch which was $5 extra (yikes!) but even that was so good, too!

During the day, we went to Wet Republic which is always so much fun. Our second day we spent at the lazy river which was packed, but definitely fun to people watch and relax. Again, everything was just perfect. 

I had never stayed here before but I would definitely return! Thanks everyone at MGM for making our stay memorable!",1,1,1

I remember this place from back in the day when we thought that a big emerald green building with a massive gold lion's head outside was just about the most impressive thing you'd ever see. Fast forward 10 years later and you have the Bellaigo, followed by Paris, followed by the Venetian, and the MGM is not so impressive. However, after a massive facelift about 6 - 7 years ago the MGM really stands out. They have a GREAT assortment of restaurants to choose from, the KA theater that hosts one of the many Cirque du Soliel shows in Vegas, the Lion Habitat, and of course, hotel rooms. I have stayed here before and the rooms were fairly standard. I'm sure the suites are much more impressive, but rating the hotel based on the facility as a whole I am going with four stars. The greatest part about this hotel? The lazy river pool (s) and the fact that you can catch the monorail here and take it up and down the strip as far at the Stratosphere Hotel. That's a HUGE bonus in my book.",12,8,13

I have stayed in the towers and the hotel part, both times sharing a room with my friends.  The rooms are nice and spacious and the beds are comfortable.

They always have issues with billing, this time around they overcharged me $80 for using a drink from my room fridge which I did not even open during my whole stay. I know the whole bullshit behind even if you touch anything that is attached to the magnetic stand you get charged. Then the lines for checking in and out are RIDICULOUS! There are maybe 400 people waiting to get checked in and only 3 people working behind the check in desks.

I was sentenced, yes sentenced to a room in the West Wing. They should have escalators to get you there since the walk to the room was so far from the check in area that you were exhausted by time you arrived in your room. The hallways had low ceilings and were dark. Honestly a bit scary.

The room reminded me of an inside cabin on a cruise ship. It has the smallest window with barely any light that was located above the bed. The bathroom area looked just like the bathroom on a cruise ship. No privacy at all! The room was dirty with hair in the shower from the last guests. The shower itself had chunks out of the floor pan. 

I felt dirty staying in the room. I tried calling the front desk to complain or at least have someone come clean the nasty room, guess what the phone didn't work.

Because the service is terrible and the hotel has just horrible policies and whatever their management is does not know how to run a hotel. 

My previous company contracted this place for a few years in a row to do their sales convention, so you would think they have spent enough money to keep MGM happy, but for some reason that's just not enough to get their people to break out a smile.

Their systems were down once, and hundreds, and hundreds of people going to the conference tried to check in, and the check in took 10 hours. Let me tell you how agonizing it is to wait for 10 hours in line because you want to gnaw your eyes out from having to wake up early to catch the flight to begin with.

So you would think, with this epic mess up, that they would comp. They turned people away, people who had reservations were turned away because they couldn't find any paper trails. What?? Are you kidding me?

I think a few people got a $25 restaurant credit. For waiting in line for 8 hours? I think I can pay for that $25 myself.

The pools were nice, but the cocktail service was extremely slow.  I only saw one cocktail waitress working, so I did not hold that against them.

I reminded Dude to put me on the hotel room check in since he was going to be working so he did and we preregistered for check in and the hotel responded that he would get an email to say the room would be available.  Resort fee only includes free internet, phone calls and fitness center.

So I arrived at the hotel and checked in my bag at the bell desk.  As check in was at 3 pm, I texted Dude to find out if he received an email about the check in but he never responded.  So I went into the check in line after 3 pm and it was long but went rather quickly as every reservation station was being utilized.  Check in was smooth; however, Dude had reserved a room in the West Wing and I got rather confused on where to find it because I went to the elevators for The Grand Tower and West Wings floors 4 and up, but couldn't find the West Wing, Floor 3, Room 528.  Finally I asked a person from the concierge, who happened to be walking around when I was bewildered, where the West Wing, floor 3 was.  She walked me to where it was located.  It is a narrow hallway between The Crush Bar and the high roller area.  From there, you use your room key to go through a door, through a long dingy low ceiling hallway, which goes on forever.  Then you find the elevator to the 3rd floor.  Once I got to the 3rd floor, I had to walk another long hallway to get to my room.  The hallways and low ceilings reminded me of a dormitory.  

Once I got to my room, I was surprised there were no windows, like I was underwater on a cruise ship with no portals to look out of.  Then I realized that this room in the West Wing was far far away from the casino and the things I enjoy doing, like working out at the Fitness Center or going to the pool.  

Speaking of the fitness center which is located in the spa and salon, it is fabulous for us gym rats on vacay!  It is huge, with a variety of machines, has a water fill up station, towels, free weights area and a stretch area with stability and medicine balls as well as free weights!  

Later that evening, when Dude and I returned to the hotel, he went to a separate line at the front desk for checked in guests and asked them if we could change rooms because of the room being far away and me not being happy.  We were lucky that the manager was sympathetic to his request as Dude said ""he would be in the dog house with me"".  We were quickly changed to a older room in the Grand Tower with a view of the roof and Mandalay Bay, my favorite hotel.

I have stayed in the MGM before the lion was removed at the entrance, many years ago and haven't stayed here since.  It still is a huge hotel to walk through and I'm glad we were able to get a room in the Grand Tower, that wasn't guaranteed so good customer service at the front desk and smooth check in.  However, the MGM needs to update their rooms in the Grand Tower to keep up with other hotels.  They have a sign in the bathroom about conserving water by hanging up your towels to reuse; however, there is a fridge which has drinks inside but you have to pay for them. The safe is hidden in one of the drawers of the nightstand which is totally unexpected

If you don't mind walking or having no view no window,  ""West Wing"" between The Crush and high roller area is your spot to reserve.  I, however, have other hotels to compare with and I prefer to stay elsewhere on future trips.  We only stayed here to be close to our friends, who are staying here.",9,4,9

My favorite part of the whole place is the new pool.  The main pool is nice because it's so big you can definitely find a spot somewhere.  If you want something much better, try Wet Republic, the MGM's new ""ultra pool"".  We were able to go on Friday morning and get in for free...not sure what the regular price is, but it's probably worth it.  There are really nice lounge chairs around the pool AND these great chairs that are actually in the pool.  Good drinks and an ok food menu.  They could have a couple more choices on the menu, because there were only 4 things (including $14 chips and salsa...what?!?).  I loved it though.

The monorail stop was a nice plus as well. 

It wouldn't be my first choice for hotel in Vegas, but the room was comfortable and the shows and food at this property are great. Looking forward to seeing it again in the future after the renovations.",1,0,0

I had originally booked the very basic room, but at check in I was upgraded for free to the West Wing. (FYI - you can check in at the airport. Look for the MGM desk behind baggage claim.) The West Wing rooms were modern but small, reminding me of rooms in cities like NY and SF. The bathroom was especially cramped - no tub, little vanity space, toilet and shower separated by an opaque glass divider. We couldn't find room for the trash can without blocking the door of either the shower or the toilet closet. The room also featured a scale. Note to MGM - I don't want to weigh myself in Vegas. 

But I will say the West Wing is conveniently located with good signage directing you to it throughout the casino. One concern I had with MGM is that it would be too, too big, and the West Wing took you away from the monstrosity of the main hotel tower. 

I think MGM has one of the best sports books in Vegas, and I like the Stage Deli that is immediately next to it. The buffet was yummy (my surprising favorite selection? brussel sprouts!) and the food court had a Nathan's Hot Dogs! The pedestrian bridge between MGM and NYNY is a handy way to get to the other side of the strip. 

I'm convinced the lions on display are drugged, but interestingly the motorized alligator at the Rainforest Cafe seemed to be a more popular attraction. 

As far as fine dining, the selection there is growing. I've eaten at Emeril's place there and enjoyed it, but it was ten years ago so I don't feel I'm qualified to give a thorough review. The resident Cirque show, KA, is excellent. 

In a nutshell - MGM is a solid, albeit nothing special, choice.",1,2,1

From the moment we stepped onto the MGM grounds it was HELL, the long lines and the rude customer service was very disappointing. I was aware that I would have to pay resort fees, but wasn't aware that I would have to pay a daily fee of over $100 for incidentals.
I didn't budget that into our trip and was pissed when the ""lady"" at the desk had no remorse or care. She continued to say that because I booked the reservation with a third party (Southwest Vacations) that's why I was being charged the additional fees. I book through Southwest Vacations every time I travel to Vegas and have never had a problem like this.

I was hoping things would get better once we finally got to our room, I was wrong. The vacation package folks are placed in what looked like the dungeon, it's called West Wing. This section is the worst, it was on the complete opposite side of the hotel. The West Wing carpet is disgusting,floors smell bad, there's no security on that end. They have a sign asking you to swipe your room key to enter, but it's broken. I couldn't sleep well at night knowing that anyone could just walk onto our floor. I also couldn't sleep well because house keeping banged on my door at 8am, wanting to clean the room. If, I could've changed hotels, I truly would've. This was the worst hotel experience EVER.

Cons: Food court is far, and poor offering of choices. Elevators are positioned way away from rooms, and we had to walk far to and from the elevator. Smaller, cluttered room.

Now, I was aware that we'd saved a bit of money by booking their lower-end option. However, I don't think that justifies the lousy hotel quality.

Maid service was terrible. Regardless of the ""Privacy Please"" sign that we hung on the door, they knocked on our door repeatedly, and would open our door if we didn't answer the knocks. Sometimes they'd stop by early enough that this woke us up or interrupted us while getting ready for brunch. To top it off, they called us on our super-loud room phone in the afternoon to confirm that we didn't want our room tidied that day.

Maybe we were the ones being weird by not wanting them to come into our room for days at a time, but I think a hotel needs to be able to accommodate that. I know that you want our daily tips, but we paid for the room; let us stay in it!

Finally, the elevator smelled really, really bad. When your elevator smells vaguely of sewage for one afternoon, maybe it's a bad coincidence with smelly food or some frequent farters who are staying there on the same night. When the poovator stinks up the hallway up to 20 feet away, every single night of a 5-night stay, that is no coincidence; that's negligent building maintenance.

It's not as ""chi chi"" and pricey as some others on the strip, nor anywhere near as ghetto as some others (which shall not be named).  The rooms are always clean, spacious, and comfy!  Our kind sized bed was phenomenal on this last trip - I could stay in bed for days!
This recent trip consisted of a group of 17 of us (for a cousin reunion) and the reservations were able to get us all in our rooms quickly and ALL ON THE SAME FLOOR!  This was incredible since it was much easier to corral the group together in the central area of our shared floor and visit each others' rooms instead of picking a meeting place in the casino or lobby.  One cousin has a baby and the hotel brought them a mini fridge for them to store milk and baby foods.  
The pool area and lazy pool has long been my favorite thing about MGM.  There are plenty of pools to choose from - from a family and kid friendly pool to the raging pool party\/club at Wet Republic!  For $10 you can rent an inner tube to float along the lazy river for half the day.  That's really my fave place to hang out.  
On the way to the pool, there's a food court and several great eating options from the casual to the fancy.  It was easy for everyone to find something they wanted and come out to the pool to hang out afterwards.
After a looong night out on Sat. - we were pleased that the hotel offered us a 1\/2 day option with checkout at 6pm at a half-day rate!

WTF MGM? It is 2017 and you STILL have rooms that haven't been updated since I am assuming at least the late 1990's?? The West Wing King was listed for $125, but I got it for $80 with my M Life membership. It should have been listed for $50 and I should have gotten it for free!

You walk into the bathroom. I really should have taken pictures of this disaster. The sink and ""counter"" - more like ledge - are a shitty blue green glass. The paint\/glue\/whatever is under the glass was peeling or deteriorating somehow so there were black splotches everywhere. THERE IS NO COUNTER. We couldn't leave anything out in the bathroom cause there was no room. The toilet area had a door made of glass that didn't provide one ounce of privacy. The shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor. The towels felt like sandpaper. 

The room was TINY, just enough room for the king bed and a small desk and chair. My room at home is bigger than this one. The lighting was AWFUL. Super dark in the bedroom, and nasty, bright fluorescent in the bathroom. MIRRORS EVERYWHERE. Two mirrored walls in the bedroom, the walls next to and behind the bed were mirrors. 

The bed was like sleeping on a piece of wood. You are given two awful pillows, with one extra pillow in the closet that was somewhat better. Thankfully I brought muscle relaxers and was able to sleep, cause I could not get comfortable to save my life.

(Monday and Tuesday) Before coming, I read plenty of reviews on Yelp and Expedia and knew that check in and check out COULD have been a nightmare! You have to expect this from a hotel that has over 6,000 rooms! We went with a plan. Instead of arriving at the usual check out time of 3, we arrived around 1:00. The line was not very long to check in during this time because we beat the check out crowd at 11 and check in crowd at 3. We bit the bullet and paid the $20 extra fee for early check in. Our whole check in time took about 20 minutes. Not very long compared to the 45 minutes that I've read on here! We were surprised by the $100 deposit fee for each night's stay, but once again it seems to be the norm here if you are staying on the Vegas strip. 

We arrived at our room and loved the layout and all the features it offered. We're not a fan of hotel pillows (too soft) so we brought our own. We loved our very comfortable king size bed. I especially loved the lamps on the nightstands because they had electric plug access. It made our phones easy to charge each night. Our view was looking towards the foothills and pool area. Still very pretty at night. The bathroom was spacious with a beautiful mirror. It served it's purpose for us. In my opinion, the BEST part of this hotel room was the blackout shades. With these down the first night there, my husband and I slept in till 11:00! We didn't even realize it was that late because the room was pitch black! We were exhausted from our ride there. 

Our room was cleaned and restocked with fresh towels on the day that we we were there. They also changed the linens and redid the bed. Loved how clean and fresh the room was. 

On check-out day, we opted to check out early at 9:00. Once again, we wanted to beat the crowd. We called the bellhop to come get our luggage and it literally only took them 10 minutes to get up to our room and collect our belongings. Our check out time didn't take long at all. 10 minutes max! When we went out to valet to pick up our car, the bellhop was already out there waiting for us. 

Overall, we had a GREAT experience at the MGM. It is called the MGM GRAND for a reason, it's MASSIVE, so be prepared to walk! 

PROS:

*great rooms at a fair price (we got a king for 75\/night)
*modern decor was aesthetically pleasing
*room shades
*clean
*good location (at the beginning of strip making it easy to get in and out of)
*you can call valet ahead of time if you are guest at the hotel and when you get down to pick up your car, you will be placed ahead of other guests - this was extremely helpful! 
*very attentive staff
*many restaurants to choose from 


CONS:

*pools are crowded and offers little shade
*it can get really crowded and busy because it is such a huge hotel 
*layout of hotel (most restaurants and pool is on the other side of hotel)
*weak WI-FI signal, if you want stronger, you have to pay an extra $15
*$25 resort fee to use the ""cardio center"" (we never saw this as we didn't care about working out on our vacation!), a daily newspaper, incoming and outgoing calls (big BOO for this)",1,0,0

I had made reservations online and secured the reservation with a credit card because I knew I would be arriving late. It turned out that I arrived even later than normal due to my flight in San Francisco being delayed. Anyways, I finally got to the MGM and must have looked exhausted. The front desk clerk asked about my flight and I told him I had been delayed and hadn't eaten because I was saving my appitite for my favorite LV restaurant. The clerk excused himeself to the back and came back and offered me an upgrade! THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE! I was so thrilled! 

The room was amazing. It was like a tiny apartment with a living room, seperate bedroom, and huge marble bathroom. So nice and the perfect spot to land after a hell'ish flight in. 

I spent the next day at the pool. The pool is really why I fell in love with the MGM. It is huge and has a current that you can ride around on all day going from water fall to water fall. They also have pool side cocktail service and allow drinks in the pool! 

This most recent time we happened to see a conecert there also.

If you are flying into Vegas, take advantage of this service because the lines at the hotel front desk are crazy long!

The MGM is huge, but contrary to other reviews on here, I believe it is well designed and easy to navigate. I use a wheelchair and it never takes me more than a few minutes to get anywhere on the property.  Just a reminder to all my Yelp friends out there...ALL casinos are designed to make you walk by those pretty little Slot Machines as much as possible. That's how they make their money. Don't expect anything different.

Our room didn't have all the bells and whistles of some Casinos, but at $49 a night, I am not complaining. It was well designed for a wheelchair user, except for the Shower, which had the bench, hand held unit and the controls all jammed into one corner, which would've made things a little difficult if I'd been alone.  Luckily, my Girlfriend and I turned it into a positive (wink, wink!). Ok, sorry if that was Too Much Information.

Every time I've stayed here the staff has been friendly and helpful. This trip was no different.  When we had problems with our Rental Car (no fault of MGM), the Concierge we spoke with went out of her way to help us!

While standing in line, I noticed an area for M Life members and wondered why that line was shorter than the one I was standing in. If you've never been to MGM Grand, they have huge screens behind the check-in desk that flash various attractions in the hotel. A ""commercial"" for M Life just happened to show and said check out Mlife.com. I figured I should check it out right then and there on my phone.

In the span of 5 minutes, I became a member of M Life and secured a lower hotel room rate for my stay! The best part was the front desk employee who honored my new reservation. I saved $100 just by joining M Life.

My hotel room was decent (view totally sucked, but who cares since I saved $100). The beds were comfortable and clean. I thoroughly enjoyed the pool area (stayed out there for four hours and was probably in the lazy river for an hour). The tube rental price, however, should be a little less ($16 for the day, but it goes down to $10 after 1 p.m.)

My only negative is the shower. The water temperature was fine the first day; the second day it took a few before it warmed up. On the third day, however, it never warmed up. We called maintenance and within a few minutes, the water began warming up. I'm not sure if they control the water temperature remotely, but a maintenance person did show up to fix a problem that seemed to correct itself.

I absolutely LOVE the toiletries! They have the best smelling lotion out of any hotel I've ever stayed in. I also enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner.

Breakfast buffet is fabulous. If you go right before they are about to switch over for lunch, you'll get to taste some great food as well. I almost forgot about Fat Tuesdays downstairs.

One huge reason.

We came from LA for a wedding at the hotel and decided to stay here for the weekend. It was convenient and we thought that it would be nice to try a different hotel on the Strip. We usually do the Monte Carlo which has always been fun. Everything was going fairly well until.....

We woke up at 3am to a HORRIBLE and NOXIOUS smell emanating from the hallway. It was soooo bad, there really are no words. When we called downstairs to find out what was going on, the front desk said that they would take care of it. 

As we were both, at this point, wide awake, tossing and turning in bed and fighting back nausea, we decided to leave the room and go down to the casino, giving the odor a chance to go away. So we trekked down the quarter mile hallway to the elevators where we could STILL smell it. Aaaahh! When we got down to the first floor (from th 11th) we could STILL smell it. I can only describe it as the funk of forty-thousand years, but this was no Thriller. 

Finally, we realized that there was no escape from the horror of this experience, so we decided to just go home. At 4:00am, we started the 4 hour drive back to Los Angeles.

Upon checking out, I informed the nice lady at the front desk that we were leaving due to the bad bad smell that had infiltrated our room. She then proceeded to tell us that a lot of other guests had  checked out that same night because of the same smell. When we asked what could possibly be causing such a bad smell, she said......wait for it.....wait for it.... THAT THEY WERE CLEANING THE RESTAURANT. NO! Say it aint so. That such a smell could be coming from a place where people eat. What's worse, that such a smell could travel up 11 floors to our room, wake us up, and force us to cut our trip short to drive back to Los Angeles before the sun came up. 

Unfortunately our two night stay was over $400, and we only got our resort fee comped which was $22. Wrong, just wrong.

There were 3,000 people from my company at the first event in June and virtually none of the coworkers that I know liked the hotel; like me, almost none of them wanted to come back to the place at our most recent company event in September.

For starters, the hotel rooms on both visits were extremely bland, if not outdated. They have worn carpet, ugly wallpaper and limited wall power outlets. There were so many other things plugged into the outlet by the room's only desk that I had to unplug one of the room lamps in order to charge my laptop and\/or cell phone.

The bathroom on my second visit was absolutely gross. While ""clean,"" there were long, black hairs EVERYWHERE...on the floor...on the counter...even on the hand towels. On two of the three nights I was there I had to use a towel to mop the hairs off the floor. I finally realized that they must be coming from the cleaning staff.

The other thing that everyone in our company hated was that you have to walk for at least 10-15 minutes in order to get anywhere in the hotel complex (except the casino floor of course). To get to any of the meeting rooms or exhibition hall is nearly 15 minutes from your room. The pool area isn't much closer.

The shops are hideously over-priced with thin, cheap ""party"" shirts made in China selling for as much as $190. I forgot a couple of personal health products at home and paid $15 for a box of Rolaids (3 x tablets) and a box of Tylenol (2 x tablets). So definitely don't forget any items that you can buy at home or it will cost you through the nose.

There is a food court with fast food options, but be warned, you get what you pay for; there are lots of young, loud-mouth punks posturing and trying to show off. In general, the MGM Grand seems to have a lot of young ""party people"" trying to vacation on a budget. The food court is okay for breakfast, but avoid it for lunch or dinner. Unfortunately, the other restaurants are mostly high-end places where you can easily drop a C-Note per person on dinner.

The casino floor is actually the nicest part of the entire complex. It is clean, well-lit and I can smoke cigars at most of the tables. The only complaint I have is that there aren't enough $5 tables, and then, they only open around 10pm or so. I like to gamble, but am no high-roller by any means.

All in all, I don't care much for the MGM Grand. It is large (6,000 rooms), too spread out, over-priced and appears to cater to the young, unsophisticated travelers who equate ""quality"" with spending a lot of money. Our company has taken us to the Venetian in the past and I would much, much rather go back there.

Well, after staying there for five nights and experiencing all the bullshit we went through, it got dropped down to two stars. And that's ONLY because the staff there was friendly.

So we lock in the rate of $50 per night in February to travel in May. We book a king bed. When we get there--""we're all out of king beds, we can upgrade you into the west wing for no charge. But a lot of people don't like the west wing, so if you don't like it, we can move you guys tomorrow."" Okay fine, we go to the west wing..even though I've been told by many people the West Wing rooms are shitty. So we get to the room, it's a dingy piece of crap. You walk in and literally walk right into the bathroom. Plus the room is SMALL!  

So the next day, we call the front desk. They say we can move between 2 and 4pm. So I check back at 2 they tell me to check back at 3:30. I call back at 3:30, ""okay we can move you to a king room (WHICH IS WHAT WE ORIGINALLY RESERVED!)--however it will be an hour before a bellhop can get your bags."" Are you f'ing kidding me!??! An hour!!?? Christ, I know the hotel is big, but still! We wound up carrying our bags from the West Wing to the front desk. Anyone who has stayed there knows that's a long freaking walk!  We complained to the front desk and told them at this point, we'd rather be staying at South Point (where we usually stay.) They got a manager and upgraded us to a suite.

So we get to the new room, turn the A\/C on full blast and head out for our anniversary dinner at the fabulous T-Bones Steak House in Red Rock (read my review for that!)  We get back to the room around 11:00pm and it feels like we walked into a goddamn sauna! I call the front desk to let them know our A\/C is not working. Okay,  we'll have someone right up. Couldn't give me a time frame. So now it's midnight, we're both tired so we call back and tell them to forget about it. Unbelievable. The A\/C works, but it worked half-assed. The TV sucked as well, they're not HD TV's and the picture was very fuzzy. Also, our room safe was competely useless since the battery on it was low, so we couldn't use it. We also had no Do Not Disturb thing for the door, so I made one myself. If I called the front desk to ask for any of these things to be fixed, I'd probably be still waiting.

Oh it gets better. The kicker was the next night when we get into the elevator. There are like four people on the elevator, we are on the 11th floor. The four other people get off at 6. The elevator goes to 10 and then DROPS two floors. My wife and I had our lives flashing before our eyes. The elevator made a creaking noise and just dropped! Reminded me of the old Edge at Six Flags Great America.

We went to the Rainforest Cafe here one night, it was ok, nothing special. The lines for the breakfast and dinner buffets were absolutely ridiculous. We waited over 30 minutes for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and over 45 minutes for dinner on a Monday night. On Friday, we went to the Rio Buffet (The best I've ever had, again read my review for that) and waited all of 2 MINUTES. Take that! 

Again, I only gave this place two stars because the employees are very friendly especially the dealers in the poker room. Stay away from here. Go to South Point instead.",1,2,1

Very disappointing with this trip as it started with the check in. 2 hour wait to check in is ridiculous. We checked our bags and came back later only to find the line was longer than before. 

They set up cheap rates but then you get hit with resort fees (about $30\/per night). Seems like everything is nickel and dime to the consumer now. They now charge for parking plus charge for a late check out. Everything comes with a price. 

It wouldn't be all that bad if the rooms were nice, but the West Wing is not something I'd stay in again. 7ft tall ceilings and endless hallways make you feel like you are stuck in a maze. The rooms are small, and bathrooms barely have any counter top space for any type of bag and it's right by the room entry door and no door to the bathroom.  

Casino is nice, but the table limits just keep raising the bar. Didn't gamble here much as Downtown had the $5 tables and MGM was starting at $10-15.

1. Front desk was fast and efficient. Husband and I got to Vegas Friday around 10:30 pm and there was a long-ass line for check in, (maybe 3 or 4 rows deep) but it probably took around 15 - 20 minutes. Once we got to the front, it was one of the fastest check-in process we've ever gone through.
2. Front desk lady was so nice and helpful, also upgraded us to a grand tower for free since they ran out of non-smoking rooms. (We were supposed to be in a west wing room which is smaller) Wish I got her name! 
3. The hotel itself is clean and easily navigated. Clear signs and directions. 
4. A lot of options for food ($$$$ to $) and most of them open late or 24 hours. There's a Project Pie here - easily one of the best deals on the Strip.

The bad:
1. The buffet was so bad. $40 for a Saturday dinner - not worth it at all. Most of the items are either too salty, too dry, or too sweet. Towards the end of my meal I felt queasy and it wasn't from eating too much; something in the food gave me mild food poisoning. 
2. I'm still a little pissed as I'm writing this. This hotel has possibly the thinnest walls out of all I've ever stayed at. The first night I thought, hmm they put us on a floor with the loudest most obnoxious people it seems. The second night, it became clear that I could hear ANY kind of noise outside my room, whether it's right outside the door or at the end of the hallway. While I understand it's not the hotel's fault that people are loud, I feel that they should keep in mind this is VEGAS. People party and come back drunk; some of them get loud and obnoxious. Why can't they make the walls and door a little more soundproof? 
We were put on the 9th floor, in a room with a connecting door. Around 5:45 a.m on Sunday, a couple hours before we had to wake up and drive back to LA, someone in the room next to us took a shower, then proceeded to use the blowdryer. I could hear the WHOLE fucking thing. The shower noise woke me up and I seriously thought someone went into our room and took a shower; it was that loud. I could also hear a guy moaning, and talking, appreciating his wife\/ girlfriend\/ booty call's body as she came out of the shower. Disturbing.

Bottom line, if you're not planning on sleeping during your Vegas trip, MGM Grand is for you. If you're an old fart like me who goes to Vegas for relaxation, find another hotel.",2,1,0

Previously, I have stayed Downtown at the Cal. The MGM is HUGE, first of all. If you are old or traveling with someone old, or with a child, or have physical problems walking, you should probably request a room closest to the elevator as the hallways are really long. We stayed in the Grand Tower and were there with our 2 month old and were able to upgrade to a room about 5 rooms away from the elevator area.
Overall, our experience was just ok. The only real good thing was that all of the staff we encountered were really nice and the lion in the lobby was cool.
Our room, although supposedly non-smoking, reeked of cigarette smoked. Which was really shitty being that we were with our 2 month old baby. The air conditioner just circulated the stink around the room so that sucked. We didn't have hot water in our shower until the last day we were there. We paid $100 to have a small fridge brought into our room so we could refrigerate the baby's formula, and even at the lowest setting all the bottles froze. 
Just a warning to people who have never stayed here before. Your mini fridge will be stocked with all kinds of goodies (soda, Jack Daniels, champagne, even a can of ""love"" goodies) but don't pick anything up! The mini fridge is computerized, and everything you lift up they will charge you for. We didn't realize this at first, we were going to use the fridge to store the baby formula and we were kind of in awe of all the stuff in the fridge so we were lifting everything out to look at it and see what we could move. Well we came across the tag on the door that said anything removed from fridge will be automatically added to your bill. We called the front desk and they were able to reset the fridge for us and did not charge us thankfully. Just be warned.
The casino is massive. Just when you think you've seen the gaming area in its entirety, I guarantee you you have not...And the odds are awful. The slots are not forgiving, and there were no winners while I was there. Maybe some small fry wins (100-200) but nothing big. Terrible place to gamble, IMO.
There are lots of good restaurants. I had my two year old and my husband along, so they had to stay in the room while I got takeout. My favorite was the Grand Wok. Lots of options throughout the hotel though, from casual food court stuff to fine dining (Morimoto, etc.)

I was getting worried because of all the negative reviews on here, but as usually that was all in vain.  No worries here, we LOVED it!!!  However, we did get off to a bumpy start, but it was soon rectified.  My husband and I went to Vegas with another couple, so we had booked 2 rooms, (1 smoking, 1 non-smoking).  Upon arrival at the hotel (about  11am) we checked our bags with a bell hop, which we actually didn't have to do because we paid $20 extra for early check in, so we went right to our room.  But the bell hop was free, we just tipped him and then they brought the bags to the room in about 5 minutes.  So we didn't have to schlep them, which was kind of nice.  We got a room on the 8th floor.  Our friends got a room on the 20th floor.  I kind of thought to myself that they would probably have a better view, but I was trying to be positive.  Well, I was right!  We get to our room and open the curtain and it's a giant stucco wall!  Our friends immediately call us and tell us how freakin'  awesome his room was.  I was LIVID!  I booked this entire trip, made all the reservations and paid the same price they did for a ""City View"" room!!!!  I called the front desk and they told me to call back around 3.  I wasn't happy, but we got changed and went down to the pool. 
The pool complex at the MGM is amazing.  They have about 5 pools, including a lazy river.  Music is playing, tons of chairs and plenty of bars!  But drinks are EXPENSIVE!  We paid $34 for 2 drinks.  Ridiculous!  I didn't even get a slight buzz.  This was the only time all week we made it to the pool.  I wish I had 3 more days just to lay by the pool.
After the pool I went back down to the front desk.  I told them my story and we got a room on the 20th floor.  I had already unpacked a little in the old room, so I threw everything back in the suitcases.  I felt like criminal running form the police!  So we ended up schlepping our bags anyway, our friends helped us move to our new room.   The 20th floor was a smoking floor, but you would never know.  We never smelled any cigarettes.   They must have a super deluxe exhaust fan that was probably the incessant humming I heard.  The beds were so amazingly comfortable I fell asleep in moments and didn't hear the humming anymore.  I was very happy with our new room.  However, our friends' view was still slightly better than ours!
It's really far to walk anywhere and you have to walk about  1\/2 mile just to get out of the hotel.  We didn't mind though.  The room was nice.  Our maid was awesome.  The bed was heavenly.  I would stay here again.",1,0,0

Vegas is weird in that you don't know where you are, what day it is, much less what time of day. The MGM hasn't changed in years, but it manages to feel familiar and welcoming rather than aged.

On our latest visit, we came here only to go to Hakkasan, and I was very impressed with the customer service. We were allowed to check bags even though we weren't officially guests of the hotel. I was skeptical about this before coming, still skeptical when a guy took our bags and gave us a ticket, and stunned when, at 5am, we got our bags back in the same condition as we dropped them off.

The POOL AREA IS WHERE TO BE!!!! Lazy river, waterfalls, like 5 different pools, jacuzzi areas, and WET REPUBLIC. This is one of the best places to cool off in Vegas. only downside is the ridiculous drink prices, $9-11 beers to $13-$18 cocktails. But this is to be expected. 

I gave this 4 stars merely for the pool. The casino is about average, the clubs are OK, definitely not the ""IT"" places, and the restaurants are mediocre, and the rooms are nice but not amazing. I would stay here again for sure to get a nice room for cheap and have a great pool!",0,1,0

My room was clean with good temperature control which is a big deal in LV. To all those yelpers who complain that the west wing is a dump, yeah it is so just don't stay there - spend a few extra bucks and you won't be disappointed 
If you are a gambler and play table games you will love the casino. I played at 5 or 6 different casinos while here and no other place has dealers or bosses who are as friendly as those here. I tried my hand at craps for the first time and was a little unsure so one of the dealers had me stand near him and helped me with placing each wager correctly

We always stayed at the Golden Nugget but for the past two years, we have been staying on the strip.  This year we started at the Monte Carlo and ended up at the MGM before it was time to go back home.
The most important part of our trip is not gambling but relaxation and with that comes the expectation of laying out by a wonderful pool and having lunch, reading, sleeping, swimming oh and drinking (not too much but a bit) frozen Pink Lemonade with Absolute Citroën Vodka, YUM! 
We loved our stay at the MGM.  It is such a large property with so much to do and so close to other popular properties like New York New York.  The guestroom was very modern and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  The swimming pool area was FABULOUS!  Although it is quite a trek from the guestroom to the pool, it is worth every step.  I love the layout, theirs an adult area, the music is just the right decimal, and they have a friendly and accessible wait staff.  The food was reasonably priced and acceptable.  I say reasonably because remember we are in Vegas, lying by the pool and someone is waiting on us and the only work we have to do is chew and swallow our food and drink.
The Lazy River is fun and you can even take your drink with you!  This is not the case in many other hotel pools.  We chatted with some guests but I was not in the mood to socialize but rather really relax.  The impression I got though was if you were interested in socializing, you could.
We received two free buffet tickets one for my husband and I each and we did try the main buffet for breakfast.  I am not a fan of buffets but I was quite surprised at the quality of the food as well as the broad selection offered.  I would definitely eat at the main buffet if we were ever to stay at the MGM again.
This property is huge so if you have an aversion to walking do not stay at the MGM.  The guestroom elevators are far from the main entrance.

Boxing fights are usually here and so beware of how booked and crowded this hotel will be. The monorail begins here to.

There used to be many poker tables but it was reduced and now, there is always a long wait list to play. Part of that section is now taken over by the night club called Hakkasan. It's always packed with bodies. One of the nights we were here, the place was packed because Tiesto was appearing. There is a lot of slot machines to play. My favorite is the wheel of fortune! ;-)

I stayed in the West Wing room and I must say, walking through the halls was weird because I felt like I wasn't even staying at MGM. according to the sweet maintenance guy, MGM remodeled the West Wing so it looks TOTALLY different and extremely modern. the hallways were a dark grey color-- the walls, carpet and doors (overkill much?) made it kinda creepy and look unfinished. the room was definitely modernized, it looked nice but I don't think it was very effective. the space was small and the PANASONIC TV BOX was not impressive. the sink area was tiny and had little space for me to put out all my stuff on the counter. the shower and restroom glass doors were HEAVY and would annoyingly slam every time we were in and out of it. the mirror...okay the little tv in the mirror is cool but there's also this vertical strip of light down the middle of the mirror, I didn't have much mirror area to look at -_-. nice efforts but I don't think it was effective. roomy casino and I believe the older rooms would have been more do-able. I would stay here if I'm not looking to stay anywhere too fancy.",2,0,1

What I really liked were the suites; the beds were very comfortable, the showers were large and the mirror was gigantic. The view was also very nice--you can see the entire strip from the top floors. The only thing was the construction going on with the news condos (it kinda kills the nice view). This hotel is also right next to Mandalay Bay, meaning it's on the edge of the strip so get ready for a long walk or an expensive taxi ride to get to where you need to go. The casino was average, and the shopping\/dining options here are not the best (compared to other places like The Venetian or Planet Hollywood). I would definitely come back here if I got another suite, otherwise, go somewhere else.",0,0,0

After partying at Club Rain all night at the Palms with some friends, my boy and I decided to go back to their hotel room since they were staying there. It was 5 A.M. and me, my boy, and a friend decided to go downstairs to do a lil gambling even though we were pretty exhausted. Being that I was the only one with like 15 bucks I gambled and lost immediately. I had to go to the bathroom so I told them I would be right back.

Upon entering the bathroom the cleaning guy told me to go to the back as he was cleaning the front area which I was going to anyway. While I walking towards the back it smells like weed which I could care less cause I dont smoke, and it didnt bother me. 

After about 40 seconds of being in the stall security comes in and says outloud ""This is MGM security and we have the sheriff outside, anyone smoking marijuana better stop right now"". Ummm ok, I didnt really pay attention because it wasnt me. So I get a knock on the door saying sir was it you, and I just replied no man I am not smoking.

So when I get out of the stall here is the bozo security guards waiting for me to get out. He starts to accuse me of smoking the week, and then after I told him didnt i tell you it wasnt me and told him not only do I not smell like weed I dont have anything on me. He says ""you flushed it"", so by this time I am already aggrivated so I shun him off to go wash my hands. As soon as I reach the sink the bathroom is bumrushed with security, supervisors, and a sheriff. Now I am surrounding by staff accusuing me of smoking in the bathroom off of a few allegations. Now I am beyond mad, and start to really please my case in the most vulgar way possible. My boy comes in to see what was going on and hes upset at well. They take both of out ID's and write down our information, and I am shaking I am so pissed. One of the 10$ an hour security guards proceeds to tell me ""for future reference next time you walk in a bathroom and it smells like weed, you should go to another.""

After telling us we need to leave the premise, I go back and ask on what basis do you have to kick us out. The guy says we have a guy who saw you go into the stall (ok), we have a guy who knocked on your door (ok), so I said basically nothing. He then tells me it boild down to ""WE DONT WANT YOUR BUSINESS"",  you are 86'd from MGM and all casinos affiliated with MGM. I pretty much tell him to fuck off.

I still plan to write a letter, I have never been so offended. Not only do I feel it was defamation of character, I felt like not one person used procedure to fully get all the details.

I dont have any respect for MGM, and plan to never come back here my entire life.",12,8,4

Things that I liked:

- Super friendly staff. Every morning, there would be several people in the hallway and each would greet us with a ""Hello\/Good morning\/Have a nice day!"" Love it!

- Great location. I walked everywhere. Right across from New York, New York. A 10 minute walk to Planet Hollywood. Definitely manageable.

Things I'm on the fence about:

- The pool. It's a huge, sprawling complex but it gets crowded very early (like by 11 AM) and it's difficult to find a pool chair. Everyone seems to just lay their towel down and walk away. Very frustrating! The lazy river was nice and quite entertaining at 5 PM with all the drunk guys trying to hit on us while not being able to talk or walk. :)

- The buffet. The food was good and there was a nice selection but the dinner buffet is severely overpriced at $36\/person. You can see my buffet review for more info.

Things I disliked:

- The resort fee. It's very annoying to have to pay $25\/day for things that I largely didn't use. Gym? Ha! Not in Vegas. Paper? Does anyone read the newspaper anymore? And this is coming from a journalism graduate. The only amenity included in the resort fee that I used was the internet and there's no way that should cost $25\/day when I pay a total of $45\/month at home. Ridiculous!

- Drink prices at the pool. $22 for a pina colada!?! Eeks! No way!",4,2,2

We are on the 8th floor with a view of a black wall. There is no refrigerator in the room. The bathroom isnt a real batgroom, it is a glass door with a toilet behind it, it's open on top so you can hear every movement coming from whomever is using the toilet lol..the shower floor is old old and falling apart, it smells like mildew.

My best girl friend turned 26 on the 4th and neither of us had ever been to Vegas so we took the trip to celebrate. MGM Grand is at the north end of The Strip across the street from New York New York. We had an early flight so we arrived in Vegas around 11am and after taking a Lyft (they're awesome by the way; we used them the entire weekend for less than $8 each trip because they had $5 off coupons) from the airport, we arrived at MGM Grand around noon. They allowed us to check in early (check in is usually at 4pm) free of charge and we did it via mobile to avoid the long lines. Via the mobile app or site (can't remember which my bestie used), we were assigned a room on the 3rd floor. However, we were able to quickly switch our room to the 13th floor with the help of an attendant and we gained a semi view of The Strip. Our room with two queens was spotless and so was the bathroom although the bathroom vent up on the wall could've used a dusting. There was no presence of any bugs\/insects\/spiders all weekend. The bed was super comfy, the pillows were a little flimsy but clean and comfy as well, and the air conditioner worked really well and really fast. However, the one decorative pillow on each bed, the two love seats, and the desk chair were dated but we didn't utilize them anyway. All in all, cleanliness and no presence of bugs\/insects\/spiders was what mattered to us and our expectations were met! I would definitely return and stay again and I know that my bestie would do the same. Also, the walls weren't the thickest but neither me nor my bestie were awakened by any noise. During the day, we could hear the doors to the rooms near us opening and closing if we were sitting in the room quietly with no music or tv and we could hear slight conversation. Oh and the casino was nice but the cigarette smoke irritated my eyes and nose all weekend. That's to be expected though at any hotel casino. Lastly, we were able to check out via mobile as well to avoid the long lines and we simply dropped our room keys in the key drop. They also charged us an additional $100 for security purposes that will be returned in a  few business days. Other than that, room service was expensive (to be expected) but delicious and the store inside the hotel was convenient but exremely expensive. Then again, everything on The Strip was expensive. Yet, to get water, smacks, etc. was more reasonable at the 24 hour Walgreens just up the street. I also must admit that not having a microwave or a refrigerator (the one in the room was fully stocked with items for purchase and couldn't be utilized to store leftovers or anything of the sort) was inconvenient. No real complaints though. We enjoyed our stay and weekend!",0,0,0

We step in to get our key to the room, Ryan was a very nice guy behind the counter check everything and told us that the room we order on line is not available so he will upgrade us to a bigger room the only difference is that we will have a queen bed instead of king , we sad OK took the keys and went up to the room, once we stem in we notice that the room was not clean at all and the bad Cover was on the bad, half on the bad and half on the floor. Besides that we didn't like the very SMALL queen bad. we go down to the desk to Ryan again and told him about the room wasn't ready for new guests and that we like to get a king bed just like we order at the beginning, Ryan went to his manager and come back to us says that the manager didn't confirm him to give us a king bed unless we pay additional price of $20 a night!!!!!!!! We order from the beginning a king bed and they can't supply it so we need to pay additional  $20..
We ask to speak with the manager his name is Dominique, SUPER RUDE AND VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL FOR A MANAGER!!
after going back and forth with him about us getting the room we order with no additional price he finally agree to give us a king size room BUT, WE WENT IN TO THE ROOM STEPPING IN TO THE ROOM AND GUESS WHAT!?!?!?! THERE IS A COUPLE HAVING SEX ON THE BAD ASKING US ""WHAT'S GOING ON""
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THING ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD???
we went down to Dominique asking him to cancel our deal with Them and give us our money back, he said he can't do it since we don't give him a chance to fix the issue, DOMINIQUE YOU ARE VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL MANAGER AND ALL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN FROM FIRST PLACE IF YOU WERE JUST GIVING US THE ROOM ORDER!!

The rooms were clean roomy and good smelling and since my friends spoke spanish they were able to get a few extra towels, pillows, ice bucket, toiletries from the maids (we tipped of course).

The place was crowded, yet the staff was almost anticipating every single question you had for them, well except a snotty, blondish filipina looking cocktail waitress who totally ignored me a few times after I asked her to please grab me some beers on a quiet 5am morning while I play some slots.

I still give this place 4 stars even though I totally showed them a lot of love(wasted money) on their slots.

If you want to be on the plus side when gambling on slots. Or wanna play roulette with only a 5 dollar minimum you HAVE TO GO TO THE OLD CASINOS in DOWNTOWN(6 miles north on I-15, exit downtown sign to exit at casino city center. People have mentioned this over and over but not a lot of tourist when they get to Vegas ever make it off the strip. That's where my friends and I spent and Won the only money we gambled.

The self parking at MGM is a nightmare if you don't take the basement escalator from the main lobby. The ""roll away"" bed is very comfortable. The open bottle\/open container while on the strip outside is LEGAL. So I ended up walking the strip or on the casino floors with plenty whole bottles of Moet champagne in hand and the cops or casino secuirty could care less.

Tabu nightclub and Studio 54 nightclub both located at MGM are free to get into as long as you have your MGM room key, have an I.D. +21 and at least get in from 10p-12p. Once you have your stamp you can go in and out. (Easier to get free liquor on the casino floor) these clubs have standard very pricey drinks.",3,0,0

MGM Grand hotel pluses: 
Checking in was great, we were able to do early check in. (Even if there's a line they have million stations the line goes quick) 
variety of restaurants shops, if you decide not to explore the strip, the hotel has plenty! 
Hakkasan club: it's popping! Calvin Harris! VIP private party area has a cool elevator to the 3rd floor and booths are awesome! It gets packed! Women outnumber men
Cafe for breakfast: they sat us facing the open casino! (cool points) breakfast was suburb! (banana bread french toast) waitress was a sweetheart 
POOL: Lazy river, drinks poolside, Wet Republic, towels and shop that has everything you need (it's pricey though- as with any hotel shop) 

Things that make me smile in Grand Tower room: 
Rooms are nice, modern furniture, outlets for phone on lamps and USB hub on dresser! (Yay for charging all our tech stuff!) 
Bathroom ! love the mirror! shelving perfect for toiletries and makeup! 
There good cable channels on the flat screen TV so if you decide to take it easy you won't be stuck with watching infomercials. 
WIFI: works and I was able to get work done. 
Staff: everyone I saw greeted me and had a genuine smile, that's awesome! 
Housekeeping was super sweet and patient
Checkout was a breeze

*One thing checkout is 11am, if you choose late checkout I believe there is a fee. So keep in mind if you plan on partying the night before!

I recently stayed for a full week as I was in town for a conference that was taking place at the MGM. Check in was annoying, I got in late (midnight) because my flight was delayed. I was very tired once I got to the front desk. There was about 4-5 employees standing behind the desk talking as only 2 employees actually checked people in. I waited about 10 mins before checking in. When checking in the girl told me my total and I gave her my CC. I get to the room and get a notification on my phone that the charge was $400 more then I was told. I called down to the front desk and was told that was the deposit they hold for incidentals. Shouldn't they have told me that? Thankfully it wasn't an issue, but still. Also the room was very lackluster. I stayed in the Grand Tower. It was no nicer then any Holiday Inn\/Hampton Inn room I've stayed in. The bathroom was very basic and the tub was small. The conference center was also super far from the rooms. Very annoying if your forgot something and wanted to run back up. The pool was extremely crowded every day and there wasn't enough room in any of the pools. Also, one of the hot tubs was broken for the duration of my stay. I also wasn't impressed by the selection of slot machines. Very few true penny slots. One bonus star for the buffet though!

We had booked a King sized bed in a non smoking room but when we arrived they did not have any available and they offered either a smoking room (Yuck!!) or a room with two beds.  This was for our wedding anniversary trip!!  

When we complained to the manager, according to her reservation was just a request and not a guarantee.  We had already paid for these rooms.  When we mentioned that to her, she said that we did not pay the hotel, but paid Travelocity.  As if that money does not go to hotel!  If they don't want to honor reservations through third parties they need to get out of those agreements.

At no point did they try to make any concessions.  

The next day we went back to see if we could get our original sized room for the next night. One was available and they gave us the new keys. We packed all our luggage and went to the new room, only to find that the keys didn't work. Back we went to the reception and they said they'd send someone up to help. So, we were sitting in the corridor with all our luggage and no room. The staff came up and opened the room for us with a skeleton key and told us he'd be back with another set of keys. We unpack and wait.

He came back with another set of keys and they don't work either. So, they said we have to move to yet another room! We packed up and moved to room number 3, and found the bed had been used, garbage on the table etc - basically it had not been cleaned after the previous guest.

However, this is now my favorite hotel on the strip. The hotel has so much to offer. It is also a very family-friendly hotel. Most other hotels on the strip have nightlife inside the casino you must pass to get to your room, but this one seemed to be contained inside a club, which was very nice to see. 
When we booked the hotel, we got $25 dining credit per night. I called concierge the day I checked in and was told I could use the credit all at once and they would cover the $75 ($25 for 3 nights) at the end of my stay. The person I talked to didn't sound confident in the answer so I called back on my 2nd night before I used the credit. I called concierge again, but the ENTIRE system was down so when they tried calling the front desk to get the answer for me they told me to go down to a specific desk. Since the system was down, that line was ridiculously long so we went to the bell desk to ask. They didn't know so they called the front desk and told me he was unsure if we would get the credit in full or if it reset every night, but he assumed so. So we went to use the credit at Cabana Grill, and after waiting 15 minutes in line, learned that we couldn't charge to the room because the system was still down. No one could check in or charge to the room. We had specific plans so this was the last time we had time to use it. Luckily we didn't, because we went down that night to see what we could do about the credit we couldn't use and learned it didn't rollover so it was only $25 a night, for 3 nights, not $75 total. We were not offered any credit, they told us it was over with and basically ""oh well, too bad.""
Tip: The credit does not rollover!!!! There is not very good customer service when it comes to these kind of comps. 
We were checked in within minutes. Almost every window, if not every window, was open. While the system was down, the line was incredibly long, but they were taking care of people. They were handing out waters on trays, etc. 
There was a walk from the parking structure to the lobby and rooms, but it wasn't bad. 
They have an amazing pool area. There are several pools to choose from, including a lazy river, which leads off to a mini pool with a waterfall. The lazy river was a hangout spot, but it didn't really make a difference. There is also a food court with an amazing chicken place, casual restaurants, and multiple specialty restaurants. They also have a good buffet.
The housekeeping and customer care was amazing! We called for extra towels and got it almost immediately. We then got a call from someone making sure we got our towels and seeing if we needed anything else. Usually it takes hours to get towels or we have to call again. The staff was also friendly when we had a question and directed us to the right people, calling them from their desk and allowing us to talk to them, rather than asking for us or giving us a long number to call.
The hotel grounds are very nice. The room was clean, the casino didn't smell like smoke, and it looked nice overall. They also had a variety of sports in a large sports area that offered food and drinks. There were some kids in this area, so I'm assuming it was a family-friendly area, which was nice. They didn't limit their televisions to one or two sports, which was fantastic to see!
The security in the hotel is also better than other hotels. They had a main lobby and then two separate areas. Those two towers had secured doors you needed to open with a key to access elevators and rooms. 
The wifi was actually free and it worked at NYNY, as well. As a guest, you get 4 devices for 48 hours. 
Overall, the rooms were nice, the staff was friendly (except when dealing with comps) and I enjoyed being on resort property. 
As a warning, they do charge the ""hold"" for the room and then say they will reverse the charge 3 days after check-out. Most just hold it and then release the hold upon checkout, so I found that a little strange.
The hotel is also very wheelchair friendly. The beds are a little high in the accessible rooms, but that was the only complaint when it came to the rooms.",2,0,0

I also ask the housekeeping why our items of food, drinks and fruits are missing and the housekeeping was HONEST THAT she took them so we didn't give her hard time because atleast she was honest enough to admit that was her fault and didn't;t know that we were staying.

We got there late on a Saturday night and the airport check in was already closed so when we got to the hotel they gave us a West Wing room on the first floor.  It was a looong walk like others said it would be.  Being on the first floor of the West Wing had its pros and cons.  

Pros:
- We didnt have to wait for the elevators and the room was relatively close to the West Wing entrance so we didn't have to walk down the long  hallway.  
- The room was small but cozy and comfy.
- Close to the exit that takes you to the stores and the strip.
- Close to the poker tables, Starbucks, Rainforest Cafe, and a lounge
- Roomy shower
- You can deadbolt and do that other lock where if someone opens your door they can't open it all the way.
- You can control the lights by the bed with a switch on the bed...niiice

Cons:
- Right outside our window were the trashcans and a small alley so we would occasionally hear cars, the trash being collected, and on the day we switched rooms there was a guy skateboarding back there and making a lot of noise.  
- Had to walk through the lounge to get to the West Wing

I couldn't take the noise anymore so I talked with someone down at the front desk and they offered me some options.  I took the Celebrity Suite on the 15th floor of the Grand Tower for $30 each night.  The location of the room was closer to the front desk, but it felt like it was as long a walk as the West Wing because it was next to the last room in the hallway on the opposite side of the elevators.  

Pros:
- Has a small fridge
- Much bigger than the other room
- Had a luxury bath tub with jets
- Better view
- More furniture

Cons:
- The bed wasn't as comfy as the other one
- We could hear our neighbors
- Creepy wall art (I don't like art with people...I feel like they're staring at me lol.  It would have been nice if they were florals or something modern though)
- Long walk to go back to strip (where the Deuce bus stop is)
- Doors slams and you can hear other people's doors slam.  Sometimes when that happens it sounds like someone is trying to open your door.  There were no extra locks like the other room had.

Overall, I think I should have just kept our previous room or at least requested one on a higher floor.  The location of our West Wing room was much more convenient to getting to the bus, the tix 4 tonight location, and other places on the strip.  Next time I go to Vegas, I will probably try staying at another hotel, but MGM was good for a first timer like myself :)",2,1,1

I had to come here for a work conference.  I knew nothing about Vegas, so I had no idea where this hotel was situated.  I learned that this is the place to be.  It is at the beginning of the Strip around a ton of other hotels\/shops\/restaurants.  The major club, Hakkasan is where people want to go.  My sister stayed in Trump Towers and ubered to the MGM when she came with friends to start her night.  5 stars for location.

It will take you forever to check in.  They have one long line that snakes back and forth for seemingly forever.  However, the check in people are very efficient and they have all hands on deck during the busy times.  What makes the wait less long is the huge screens constantly playing music videos.  If you have to wait in line, this is it.

The room itself was nice.  I'm sad you have to pay $25 if you want a refrigerator.  Don't touch the stuff in the mini fridge unless you want to pay obscene amounts.  The walls are a little thin.  I could hear the people in the room next to me, but luckily when I wanted to sleep they were no longer partying.

The conference center was super far from my room.  It was about a 10 minute walk and I walk fast.  I definitely got my steps in.

I heard the pools are fantastic, but I never had a chance to check them out.  However, whenever I gazed longingly at them from the conference, I noticed that there always seemed to be open lounge chairs.

Overall, I think this place is a pretty good place to stay.  I'd recommend it.",3,0,0

It followed me all the way through the hotel, into the attraction, and in fact, was still on my clothes hours later.

You either have to blow $100 for two on every meal unless you want a hot dog or Mcdonalds...there are not really many middle price options.

The hotel is huge with over 5000 rooms so be prepared for the crowds.  The staff was friendly for the most part (more on that later).  The room was nice and had a very large bathroom.  Also we had a cool view of New York New York which was neat to see especially at night (of course this will depend on where your room is located).  The hotel has a good location towards one end of the strip so you were able to walk down the strip pretty easily.  Also there is a raised walkway that leads from MGM to New York New York which was nice because you could easily visit both  properties if you wanted too.  The pool is pretty darn big but also packed with party goers all seemingly drinking by 9am in the pool but then again it is Vegas.  Too crowded for my tastes though.  Plenty of shopping inside the hotel and many restaurants to chose from as well but be prepared to pay top dollar for food (we ate at the burger pub and it was $20 for a regular cheese burger... Ouch!).  The only drawback to my experience was trying to check out.....  

 I called the bell desk and didn't get an answer for several minutes so I tried the operator with the same result.    No big deal as I figured the phone lines were just down for a minute.  So I walked down to the lobby and informed a lady at the front desk of the issue.  Where she proceeded to explain to me how I was doing it wrong (with quite a bit of attitude).  I didn't quite know how to take this as I was simply pushing the button in the phone in my room assigned to the departments I wanted.  Anyway she said she would send a bell  person to my room but not even a good morning or apology for the inconvenience  and a bell person didn't show up.  So, I called the manager.  This time I got an operator fairly quickly who was very friendly and wanted to make sure I was connected to the right manager for my specific problem.  Alicia (the manager) quickly got on the phone and was very apologetic for my concerns.  She reassured me that the problem would be resolved immediately and did have a bell person at our room within minutes.  She also made sure valet put us on a priority (which I wasn't expecting).  Also she said she would have a conversation with the lady at the front desk so this wouldn't happen again.  So, I'm not going to let one person at the front desk ruin my experience, especially when Alicia was able to rectify the problem so quickly and graciously.  Thanks Alicia.  

So, I would recommend staying here if you're in town.  The staff is friendly (mostly).  The shops are nice.  Lots of food choices but a little pricy.  The pool is large and basically an all day party (if that's your thing). The rooms are nice and it had a good location.",3,0,0

Instead, we were given a queen size with a view of the airport but not informed of this at check in, so disappointed from the start. When I called the front desk I was told the hotel was crowded and that was all that was available. Oh well!

The room was decent but there was a sewer gas odor in the bathroom sink. Facing the airport in the Grand Tower is like having someone with a leaf blower outside your room. Forget about sleeping in or bring earplugs if you want to stay in bed past 6:00 AM. At $245.00 a night, we will spend our money elsewhere.

Staff at this hotel is very friendly and courteous. We were always being talked to and felt very welcome. The place was ""Super"" crowded when we were there. I am not sure if this is the norm or what, but damn. We had to wait in line about 30 minutes to check in which is crazy to me. Once checked in, we had to go check our bags at bell desk because there were no rooms ready and would not be until about 3 hrs from when we checked in. Once our room was finally ready, we picked up our bags and went up to the room.

The rooms are nice and have been updated recently. They have all the amenities needed including desk, chairs, flat screen, nice carpet and a very comfortable bed which is big in my book. The pillows were not very good though in my opinion. I think they were feather pillows and offered no support. You just sunk into them and ended up laying flat. Housekeeping was very nice and they did a good job cleaning and restocking our room. For the price we paid I thought we got a nice room.

The only issue I have with this hotel is how crowded it was and also how big it is. From our room to the front of the hotel to go out on the strip was easy 1\/2 mile walk. 
Add to that the throngs of people and it made it very difficult to go out and do anything.
You had to face the giant walk and also fight the crowds to get through. We went to many other hotels and casinos while in town and this was by far the most crowded and hardest to move around we visited. Next time we come, I may try to find something a little less packed and better laid out than this location. But, they have everything you need and are close to airport which saves on cab fare.

The location is more toward the South strip (by New York New York, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay) which is great because I find it to have more of a nightlife for the younger crowd. The hotel itself has amazing entertainment choices. I checked in at 2:30 in the morning and there were so many people enjoying the night at lounges and bars and restaurants. 

The staff was super friendly and nice. I got there and checked in within five minutes. He showed exactly where to go to get to the elevator and provided a map of the strip.

The green neon just stands out in the nightline of the city. The lobby itself is just to die for. How awesome is this lobby? I would pay rent there and set up a bed and live there, thats how great it is.

What I love about this place is that I came out of my room, took the elevator down, and when I got out I saw Rick Springfield in the lobby. RICK SPRINGFIELD!!!!!! Dr Noah Drake on ""General Hospital""!!!  the dude who sang ""Jessie's Girl"" was in the damn lobby of my hotel!!!!!

it is just a great, great place thats as close to heaven on earth. I do, however, deduct one star because the MGM Grand Buffet wasn't anything great. But wait!

Over the years this place has evolved just like Vegas itself. It isn't most posh, or the newest, or the coolest place in Sin City, but I have loved staying here from the time I was a broke college student to now. Always a good time and plenty of adventures, some of which have to be permanently erased from the camera ;-)

ROOMS: I have mostly stayed in the suites, and on my last visit it was a pleasant surprise, since most of them have been recently remodeled. Spacious rooms with a large bathroom, full size closet and a separate sitting area. Bathroom has double sinks, glass stand in shower and a tub with shower. Beds are fairly comfortable, and now you can plug in your iPods (just bring the auxiliary cord), phones, cameras, etc.

POOL: You gotta love the Lazy River. Yes, sometimes it's packed with d-bags, but hey, it's Vegas, everyone is here to party, so just relax and make new friends if you want, or just have fun with your own crew. MGM also has an adults only pool, a quite area pool and of course the Wet Republic, which is awesome to rent cabanas at!

DINNING: From Starbucks and Crepes to Craft Steak and L'Atelier MGM has 20+ eating establishments on its grounds. Sushi, gourmet Chinese, Italian, French, Tex-Mex, pretty much anything your heart and stomach desire. I love Diego's for a quick and inexpensive bite. Craft Steak is fantastic, but be prepared to drop some cash, honestly I am not sure it's worth it. Wolfgang Puck Grill has great breakfast\/brunch options. Many restaurants offer a prix fixe menu, which is a good way to save $$.

CIRQUE DU SOLEIL - KA: State of the art and technology rotating stage, acrobatics, martial arts, beautiful story line and music. Every Cirque show is so different and I love it! Do not miss this one, you will not be disappointed!

SPA: MGM Spa facilities are pretty small in comparison to other resorts, but they still have all the services you would want and need. Every Vegas trip, my girls and I do SPA treatments on our last day, and if we spent all the $$, then you can just get a day pass for $25 and enjoy refreshments, saunas, whirlpool and a comfy lounge. A great way to unwind a relax before the flight home.

I have gambled away hundreds of dollars at MGM Grand but have never stayed. We thought we'd give it a try since the poker room was one of the best (was...not in its current state.)

It was easy to check in and I actually got a room around noon instead of waiting until 3pm. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with which room we got but it was in the North Tower. Albeit it was modern, looked completely new\/renovated, but it was small and far from the main elevators. The way the bathroom was laid out, made me feel like I was on a cruise or airplane. The bed was comfy but the way the TV was positioned with the porthole they called a window, really made me think I was on a ship.

Unfortunately, after my latest trip out to Paradise, I'm sad to say that the MGM will no longer be my first choice. I recently convinced a friend to pick a suite at the MGM for his birthday. The suite was cool, though a bit dated compared to it's counterparts elsewhere, but it was a great deal for so much space. Everything went well until I was on my way back home. I realized that I'd left a swimsuit behind in the hotel - I'd left it to dry and was about to pack it in before getting sidetracked - so I called the hotel up letting them know. What I did not expect was them to say that the housekeepers had not turned anything in from the room.. Mind you, this was maybe 1 hour after we'd left and I'd distinctly pinpointed it before leaving so there was no way it could've ""fallen in the trash"" or been left somewhere else. It was hooked onto the faucet so it could only be removed deliberately and it was impossible to miss (bright orange). Now it's only $40 so I didn't bother filing a complaint, but it's the principle of the matter. If you can't trust hotel staff to keep their hands off a $40 swimsuit, can you trust them with anything else? That's my main problem. A friend once left an iPad at the Venetian and a called was placed to HIM as soon as it was found. Speaks volumes when hotel staff might feel the need to steal something as petty as a $40 swimsuit. 

I've already had to advise my coworkers to move an upcoming event in Vegas to another hotel after this experience, and I'm sorry to have to let the MGM go. It's heartbreaking to see a once great hotel get overshadowed by all the newcomers, but there's a reason this is so. Still, thanks for all the memories MGM!",4,0,0

I've been using this hotel since mid-90's when they tried to make everything downstairs ""family"" friendly, until they figured out that they can not make money out of people who cut-coupons so junior can someday go to college. Then it became boxing mecca. I think I like it just the way it is. The second largest hotel in the world and largest hotel resort complex in the US. 

The MGM includes five outdoor pools, rivers, and waterfalls that cover several acres, a huge convention center, the MGM Grand Garden Arena, CBS Television City, and the Grand Spa. Lots of shops and night clubs, more than a dozen restaurants, and probably one of the largest casino areas in the county. 

I just hope that LVFD has long enough fire ladders to reach the nooks and crannies of this big building. Located on the Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection, there are even pedestrian bridges to keep the crowds from getting mauled by LV traffic.

This place used to be great and has gone so far down hill I'm not sure if I'll ever come back.  

In the past couple years staying here I've experienced several times in which the hot water has not worked.  The last time I stayed here I was in one of the coveted sky loft suites and the water was shut off while two of us were using the shower and all soaped up.  We called maintenance and they never showed up.  We only knew the water was back on later in the day when the showers started on their own.

On my current trip we had the emergency alarm go off and had to walk down 29 floors.  To our shocking surprise security had no idea the alarm went off stating ""we saw so many people in their pajamas we though there was a pajama party"" wow that makes me feel safe the staff had no idea an emergency alarm went off.  

I'm not a crazy gambler but I spend decent money at MGM properties and am platinum with Mlife.  I'm strongly considering moving to cesars.

As a local, booking Friday night before Saturday arrival, I would expect room prices to be good, but this is not the case. $324 ++. Really??? No room anywhere is worth that much, especially a standard. 

I gambled some slots Sat night for about 2 hours. Not once did I see a cocktail waitress 

Pool is nice - really enjoyed my stay there. Except again, service was horrible. Our first day near the Lazy River, the waitress never looked at us, asked if we needed anything, nothing. When you pay high prices, you expect and deserve the best service. At the very least decent service. Sunday we chose the adult only pool and were at least asked if we needed anything, although well after I went and got drinks from the bar.

The rooms are nice and clean, with newer linens, mattresses, decoration. Beds very comfortable, pillows a little too hard. Bathroom electrical outlet didn't work, and yes I pushed the breaker! 

It's a big casino, and lots of walking. I actually enjoyed the elevator set up with the West Tower.....easy to get to, fast elevator service. I had a $5 cup of coffee at the Cupcake place. $5 for a protein drink at the little store there too.

When you compare it (or any on that list) against the newer hotels, it's just not going to hold up.  The new hotels all learned from the previous ones as time went along, so of course the Bellagio, Venetian, Aria, Wynn, etc. are better than the MGM Grand.  It's easy to improve upon things once you've seen them play out elsewhere.  For that reason, it's admittedly a little unfair to downgrade the MGM Grand for opening near the beginning of The Strip's modernization.

With that said though, as you're deciding where to stay, the comparison has to be current day against current day, and the MGM Grand is one of my least favorite hotels on The Strip.  The walls in the rooms seemed paper thin, the room itself felt dark and uninviting, and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale.

The room was spacious and very clean but the bathroom was pretty basic. 

The best part of our stay here was the being a short walk away from the KA show they show in their theater. WOW, no words to describe this circus de soleil- it's a MUST. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for your trip to the strip - but I wouldn't personally pay for it. It is a bit pricey.",1,0,0

There was 3 times they did not abide by our door sign. Two times we had knocking. Once was management pounding on our door, waking us up from a nap. I yelled ""What !"" the lady responded management, just checking to see if things are ok!?!  I'm looking out the peep hole this lady was going around knocking. I cracked open the door to see if the sign was handing and it was. Another time it was housekeeping. And what really disturbs me. Is on our way back I notice the Do not disturb sign on our door was taken off when we were coming back. We open the door. My bra and dress laid out on the bed (weird) and yes the room was clean. But WHAT PART OF DO NOT DISTURB DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND!  That doesn't mean you take it off the door and come into the room or knock and pound on the door either.  
We also were downgraded a room. I'm not sure if that was an Expedia thing or MGM. We will not stay there again.",2,1,1

Maybe my expectations were too high for such an established hotel and casino.  Overall they do a great job with the hotel, just not sure I found the value in it.

Positives:
*Fast Check-In (Saturday afternoon, less than 10 minutes total)
*Friendly Staff
*Large Casino - One of the bigger casinos on the strip and a ton of tables and machines.
*Clean Facility
*Sportsbook - I won't go into a long story here, but I will say I had an issue with a lost betting slip.  I expected I'd get a lot of shit from the supervisor in the sportsbook, but the guy was super nice and understanding and took care of me very quickly.

Not So Positives:
*Location - Southern part of the strip so you aren't dead center.  NY NY is the closest, everything else is a bit of a trek.  The lobby is a good distance from the strip, so you want to exit out of the casino if you want to be anywhere close to the strip.
*Taxi's - HOLY CRAP why is the taxi line always long at this hotel, seems they could do a better job at facilitating their guests.  Waiting 10-20 minutes for a taxi all the time is ridiculous.
*Layout - not a fan of the layout of the hotel.  Getting from one end to the other is a pain and even after spending 3 days here I found myself heading in the wrong direction multiple times.
*Casino games - Expensive, newest stuff, but also the most expensive stuff, larger casinos typically don't have the best payout and MGM is no different.  Minimums are high on everything, so bring your $$$.

I'm not sure if I'll stay at the MGM again.  I think there are better values on the strip.  The rooms here are nice, but not any nicer than a lot of the other hotels.  I would prefer Treasure Island or NY NY over MGM at a lower price.",2,0,0

She kept stating and insisting that there were only $400.00 tickets available when another employee and was able to find tickets for $200.00. Then she lied again stating that her computer was not refreshed. We understand that is a business but there is no reason to make a dishonest business. I imagine that the MGM did not build their great reputation in this matter and it is unfortunate that they have such a dishonest employee working for them. I hope that the administration is able to address this issue and she is delegated to a more suitable position for her. We were lucky that an honest man came around and we were able to buy the lower price ticket.,0,0,0

ROOM: clean, 14th floor, every thing was working & in good order, we had a beautiful view of the strip, especially at night. 

KING SIZE BED: extremely comfortable, pillows every where, soft like cotton balls.

GRAND SPA: My husband and I both got body massages & It was awesome, the service was well above & beyond, totally worth the price which wasn't bad at all considering we got 15% off. They were very professional & treated us really good. I also had a deep hot oil scalp massage, I got the hot oil but she lacked on the scalp massage. The Spa is awesome, every thing from slippers to robes, to unlimited drinks & snacks were included. The whirlpool, sauna & steam room was awesome.
We also had a great work out in their gym. The machines are great, work out while watching TV, bottled water was unlimited & free, towels included.


GRAND POOL: Very crowded, barely any space to swim, only got a chance to dip in to the pool for a bit. We had a hard time finding a spot under the shade to lay out. Filled with drunk people & again; a lot of kids around them too. With all this happening, it was hard to enjoy the pool.",2,0,1

Comfortable bed, but thats about all i can say. The rest of the room is all for looks. There was no refrigerator and no microwave and we ended up wasting a lot of food. The ice bucket was waaaay too small and we ended up filling the sink with ice making it useless. There was a bright green light coming in the window all night and it was annoying. At one point the tv wouldnt turn off and i call to call the main desk and have them send someone up to fix it. When he got there it only took a press of a button to fix it. Why didnt they tell me to do that on the phone? Sorry buddy no tip. I hated the bathroom set up. Theres no tub, and theres jut a glass door for the bathroom which was a little uncomfortable because the whole room can hear you. There is a stupid pointless tv screen in the dead center of the mirror in the bathroom. It makes no sense, we didnt use it, and it just got in the way when my girlfriend needed the mirror. Im only giving this room 3 stars because it was very convenient for getting to the the places i needed to go. The UFC fights i was seeing and KA were both in the hotel and it was a very short walk to both. It was July so i didnt want to go outside much. The casino itself was ok. Decent restaurants and a good food court if you dont want to spend a lot of money. I recommend the Studio Cafe.Also, a big downside is theres no more lions and the place was under renovations so it was a little confusing getting places. If your planning on doing a lot of things in the other casinos i would just stay there, but if your seeing a UFC fight or seeing KA it might be be kind of worth it.",0,0,0

Pros
1) Good location
2) Stayed in the most economic room in the West wing, it was cute, modern, and had a good view
3) Food court with several options 
4) Very friendly staff, especially the cleaning crew! 
5) The hotel was packed but no noise issue from neighbors 
6) Nice pool 
7) Good size parking lot
8) Didn't use the casino but when walked by, the ventilation seemed good compared to others on the strip

Cons
1) Long wait for check in
2) Mobile check out didn't work 
3) TV didn't properly work. We were in the middle of a movie when it suddenly went blank. Flipped through all channels and they either said ""no signal"" or would play for 5-10 seconds and go blank. Called the front desk and we were told it happens all the time since they switched to digital. She offered to send someone up to our room to repair but it was already late in the evening and we didn't want people to be walking in and out of our room, so we declined. We didn't go to Vegas to gamble...went to see a show and to relax, so it was disappointing.
4) Room was clean but shower was dirty. 
5) Shower water pressure was a bit on the weaker side 
6) Mattress and pillows were stiff and uncomfortable. We both woke up with sore neck and headache 

For $125 (+Resort fee) per night, I'd say it was fair. Not sure if I would go back though.",0,0,0

Management upgraded us to a suite free of extra charge, which was a little more spacious with an extra TV.  They were friendly enough, but my friend said they didn't seem surprised AT ALL about it.  The next day I thought I had left my iPod behind, and when I realized and we called down to see if we could search for it, we were told that the old room already had new occupants.  Uhhh.

1. Check in.  Yes there was a line, it moved quickly , room was ready and charges were explained up front and check out was quick and accurate as well
2. West Wing.  Yes it not luxury , but it suited our needs just fine, exits right onto the strip, comfy bed, room service was amazing.  Agreed that the bathroom set up is awkward and I would not recommend it if it's your first trip together as a couple or you are shy about your bowel habits (lol) but we will be back next year. We did not once smell cigarette smoke or the elevators which we were right beside
3. Size of hotel.  Compared to our casinos in Connecticut, all the casinos here were small , so no... Did not feel that the walk to anything was an inconvenience
4. Dinning:  we only ate at The Avenue... Breakfast was amazing .  Pricey... But it's vegas and I was on vacation.... So not an issue for me.  Otherwise there are several places we grabbed coffee and snacks( the crepes... To die for ) but if we wanted, there were plenty if choices and price ranges to choose from
5. WiFi.  Perfect connection the entire stay
6. Stolen items.  There is a safe in the room.  The hotel has them for a reason and you should always use them. Period.

Couple of things:
We arrived around 5pm on 12\/24, and it took close to 1 hour for the check in.  (By the way, every time I walk by the lobby there is a huge line for check in, so I don't think it is an isolated event).   I just hope that the hotel managers know that for ever minute the customers waiting on line, the hotel is losing $$ because the customers can't go ""donate $$"" on the gambling tables and eating the two pieces sushi for $50.   Fix the check-in issue MGM...!
On our 2nd day, we came back at night around 10pm only to find that our room has not been cleaned.  I called housekeeping, and the lady told me that there were too many rooms to clean today so they couldn't get to all of it.  When I told her that I expect my room to be cleaned her attitude basically said ""you need to suck it up, we just don't have the staff"".  She then just transferred me to the front desk while I was talking to her in a middle of a sentence..... After explaining the situation to the front desk AGAIN, they offered me a 2 day resort fee credit, and move to another room.  For MGM - I don't really care about your 2 day resort fee or a new room. I just wanted a no drama vacation, and you did a good job making sure that didn't happen....  Fix your customer service level and house keeping department!!

Overall, my recommendation is to keep your expectation LOW.  They are not as good as they say they are.  And maybe go during a slower season, hopefully they are put more attention on you.  The room is not bad for a regular hotel room, but try to stay in the newly renovated ones if you can.  The in room wi-fi is not good, sometimes you can't pick up signal.",0,0,0

I love the Signature and I would recommend their suites over the MGM but if you do decide to stay at the MGM Grand here's a little warning I wish somebody would have told me. We booked a Jack Pot deal through Southwest. We got a West Wing King. So we arrive at the hotel and check in and begin walking to our room and about 10 minutes later we finally reach the doors entering the west wing. All of a sudden we felt like we were in a college dorm. The carpet was grimy the walls gray concrete The rooms have no view and they're extremely hot. Apparently the air-conditioning doesn't work in the dungeon.  Not ideal for sure but we could have made it work if it didn't take what felt like 30 minutes to get from the lobby to our room!! This place is HUGE so from our room to the pool would have been like half a days journey. We paid some ridiculous upgrade rate to move our room to the Grand Tower just so we wouldn't spend the whole weekend walking back and forth. This is one of those hikes where if your left your phone in the room you'd just say screw it.

2nd issue for me was the staff. There were at least two pit bosses and 4 dealers that literally made me want to leave tables.  I've never had so many people scold me for my hand placement or talking loudly with my friends. Apparently being a little rowdy in Vegas is now illegal? There were some dealers that were a lot of fun but overall I would rate the staff at MGM at a 6 out of 10

There are much better places to stay in Vegas and for sure better places to gamble.

One positive thing I want to make sure to throw in. We rented a cabana on the pool and was very reasonably priced. 800 min food and drink spend. Our waiter Joey was the best. Plus once Calvin Harris came on at Wet Republic they played it over their sound system. We had the best seat in the house. One of my top 5 pool days in Vegas",2,0,0

During my stay in September, I was staying by myself and booked a West Wing room for 2 nights. It's just me so the west wing room was decent for one person. I must admit, the hallways and doorways were creepy. Dark and gloomy. Anyhoo, the king bed was so comfortable! Love the black out shade and flat screen tv. The only negative was the sink and shower water pressure. It doesn't drain well at all. I actually like how the West Wing section is near an exit\/entrance to the Strip. I don't have to walk far to walk outside. 

My recent stay was in May, which was last week. My husband and I stayed in a Grand King room for 3 nights. It actually is nicer than the West Wing section. Elevators, hallways and doorways are nicely decorated and well lit. Grand king room is bigger than the West Wing king. Big windows overlooking the pool and mountains. We were in Floor 25 so thank goodness, we're not facing the roof. The only 2 negatives is the King bed and the shades. Bed is old and on the firm side. Luckily we were able to sleep due to tiredness from walking all day and night. I prefer the bed in the West Wing instead. The shades were not black out. When the sun comes out around 5-6am, it's bright in the room. So make sure you bring your eye mask to sleep! Bathroom was good. Water pressure was ok and works.

For the MyVEGAS rewards, I was able to use my room comp rewards for both of my stay. For September, I used the comp one night stay and paid for the other night to make it 2 nights. For May, I was able to use the comp 2 night stay and paid for the other night to make it a 3 night stay. The front desk clerk was very nice and was able to upgrade me from a West Wing to a Grand King for $20 per night which I didn't mind paying for the upgrade. Luckily, they had rooms to do the upgrade. 

Housekeeping were awesome. They cleaned the room daily. Gave a good tip. The Grand pool was great. Chill vibe with awesome staff. Lazy pool was fun and great area to relax. The cabana grill was very good. Was able to munch on chicken & waffles and salmon entree. Both were delicious. The frozen cocktails were so so. One was strong and other was weak. 

Overall, I would definitely stay at MGM again. Just wish the check in lines weren't so long. Love the MyVEGAS comps. It makes my day and save money.",3,2,1

We booked the simplest room which was a West Wing King and I was able to score an upgrade. We were given a $900\/night Marquee Suite on the 15th floor as well as complimentary wrist bands to Wet Republic- $115\/day for 2 and Hakkasan-$75\/night for 1, for the entire 4 nights of our stay!  Doing the math that was a grand total of $7,660 in free amenities! Couldn't believe it! I initially asked for the Forbes List Skyloft one bedroom suite but none were available and that was entirely ok with me bc we got the next best thing! 

A long walk down the hallway to the Marquee Suite with a mini foyer before the entry way and personal security cameras we were nearly jumping for joy when we opened the doors! Marble floors, massive dining room table, two living rooms with massive screen tv's, mini bar\/ wet bar area, two decorative bedrooms with sofas, one bathroom, a master wrap around bathroom, for a total of 1 bathtub two standing showers, 1 jacuzzi, and the best part was the bedazzling wrap around views of the airport, mountains, Tropicana St, the Strip including; Mabdalay Bay, Delano, Excalibur, and New York in sight! In the mornings a line of helicopters would zoom right past our window while giving tours! 

I love the MGM district! It was simple and modern and not overly themed like Paris or New York. I would order crepes and freshly squeezed fruit juices and tea in the mornings from Blitz. On weekends starting Friday morning don't even think about getting Starbucks bc that line is a block long. Having the monorail so easily accessible was a major perk as we frequently rode. Mornings at the Grand Pool Complex became routine. I tried sneeking into the Mansion and got kicked out! Lol it was worth a shot! A plain water will cost $9 at the bar and 2 bottles of water from the store $13! Welcome to Vegas. 

I ordered 6 jumbo cookies and a pot of Earl Grey on Saturday night for room service! $36! The delivery guy said, ""Ms. Torres this is an unusual order. Tea & Cookies? I'm usually delivering buckets of beer!"" I said, ""The night life is fun and all but sometimes you just gotta chill and get cookie wasted!"" 

There is a plethora of food options from cheap to fine dinning as well as shows and entertainment! Skip the Pizza in the food court it's no good! Bad poker room. Cool Sports Book Lounge.

my friend got a free room here and how could i say no to something free?!? that's like turning down free air or water, and w\/o that i don't know how long i'd survive for... maybe like 4 mins tops?
the room was ordinary... our view included the roof of the casino.  OH!!  the creepiest thing of the hotel is that when you put the shades down in your room at night time, the whole room turns green.  its very eerie.
another thing i found annoying is the water shower head.  i could not adjust it.  
besides that, the beds and room are plain jane.  nothing to really rave about here.

they did away with the lion cage\/den, but i think they said that they will put it back soon?  when it was there, i believe it housed 2 lions and you could walk under them and watch the trainers teach and or command them to do tricks. 

they have decent eateries and a food court for cheap people on the go.  
they also have arcades for young kids to play at.

There are about 30 million people in the hotel at any given time, so your odds of experiencing hospitality are 1:30,000,00 - which are better odds than getting an even break.

The lobby at the MGM Grand is an acre of bare marble, with a big golden lion standing in a flower pot at the center of it.  It's a Beverly Hillbillies bus station without the benches  - you'll sit in the casino porcupine. 

I tried standing in the lobby, leaning up against the lion and reading the daily news, but tourists kept bothering me with request to take their picture with the lion.  I tried sitting on the floor in the lotus position, but a guy with a mop arrived immediately to mop exactly where I was sitting.  If you like sitting in hotel lobbies like I do, I recommend you bring some camp chairs with you.        

The casino stretches from Tropicana on one corner of the hotel, to Las Vegas Bl. on the opposite corner. It's a king hell big money pit.  It's noisy, smoke filled, and it took my money - I hate it.  I played the penny machines.  After loosing $6 in transaction fees to the ATM, I lost the rest to that heartless mechanical one-armed bastard.

The rooms were basic Wall Street meets the Poster Shop - a vending machine full of overpriced drinks and lousy mass produced hotel art.  I worked in the hotel art industry for a few years, and let me tell you, there's a boatload of money to be had selling these pathetic finger paintings to hotels, but in the end, some poor bastard from Hoboken has to sleep with the damn things - or maybe watch pay-per-view while sipping a $7 bottle of vendo-matic water.   The bed was comfortable though, and the electric blackout curtain kept the room nice and dark.

The Grand Buffett was $35 but a hell of a spread.  They had breakfast and lunch going simultaneously.  I usually shopped the breakfast aisle for eggs and home-fries, then hit the lunch aisle for some salmon to make salmon hash and eggs.  The price really isn't too bad considering all of the orange juice I ordered. 

There is a constant pounding drone of high-energy, up-tempo, techno-electronica, bass-thumping, overly mixed music being extruded from strategically placed stealth speakers to create an ambient, universal, ubiquitous, umbrella of sound no matter where you go.  It's in the casino, the restrooms, the lobby, the sidewalk, and at the pool - they really crank it at the pool.         

The Lazy Rivers pool is the best thing at the MGM Grand.  I flipped onto my back, let my ears fill with water - ahhh... the racket is gone - and float away in the current.",4,12,5

You stumble to the bathroom in your hotel room and drag a toothbrush across your face by rote.  Oh, how good a shower would feel on your pillow-marked face!  You step to the shower and reach down to the controls.  You turn the lever counter clockwise and it goes on briefly.  But you reach the end of the lever's range of motion and it turns off.  Huh?  You squint at the lever and surroundings which bear no demarcation at all.  Your oxygen-deprived brain is unable to comprehend how to use this absurdly complicated shower mechanism.  Both ends turn the water off?  You put the lever in the middle and the shower starts spewing water again, but it's cold.  You look up, and a bizarre, futuristic looking faucet made of copper is shooting out a single jet that looks like a high powered super soaker.  You play with the temperature gauge for a long two minutes, finally acquiring the proper temperature.  You resign yourself to a shower jet that is far too forceful to be comfortable and step into the tub.  What?!  The tub is filling rapidly and the drain is closed, with absolutely no visible open\/close control.

Yeah, the shower is a confusing device.  Other than that, MGM has a decent hotel, a decent casino, a mediocre location.  For simplicity and brevity:

Pros:
-Ample supply of table games ($10 craps)
-Reasonably priced hotel
-Friendly service
-Large selection of restaurants on the grounds
-Monorail access

Cons:
-Ever seen the cross-shape of the hotel?  Hotel rooms at the end of the hallways are astonishingly far away from the elevators
-Questionable organization of the casino floor.  Somewhat harder to get your bearings than in other casinos
-Weak location.  Other than the monorail, it takes a crazy long time to get to neighboring casinos

The casino part sucks because they didn't appear to have any updated games or at least a wider variety. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.

I stayed here several years ago in their ""West Wing"" and came back a few weeks ago for the Madonna concert. I had gotten the Madonna tickets two days before the Sunday concert and managed to find a great deal on a room here for Saturday and Sunday night.

Pros
Can be reasonable room rates
Rooms in the regular hotel (not West Wing) look very modern and are recently renovated 
Once the cocktail waitresses know that you tip they are pretty good about coming around regularly. They are also very friendly.
Convenient if you are seeing a concert at the MGM - and I actually like the concert venue.

Cons
Awful Check In - not one line, just a cluster-f*ck of people walking up to an agent with no since of order
Not great customer service - I called the concierge for help with a dinner recommendation and was on hold for 20 minutes before i finally hung up.
No robes
Restaurants are very hit and miss - see my other reviews

I don't recommend staying in the West Wing unless you only plan on hanging out at the Sports Book. It is VERY far away from everything. When I stayed here a few years ago it looked really cool and modern until a fuse blew and I had to call 3 times to get it fixed. Finally they moved me to another room after promising me multiple times that someone was on their way to take care of it. The West Wing was just so far from everything that it takes forever to do anything. It is close to the Sports Book though so if that is all you want to do than maybe you would like it.

Like I said, I may be back here, but not unless it is for a concert.",2,0,2

Come here to get a reasonable price, along with a reasonable room. The customer service is pretty good, they are usually friendly at the front desk.

This is the only hotel though I get confused walking around through, I can NEVER find my way out. 

MGM grand hosts many events, ranging from UFC fights, to concerts, to award shows. Try to take in at least one even while you are there. The grand arena is huge!

CSI Crime Scene is fun, kinda small. I noticed my kids had a hard time paying attention - but I had a blast. 

Hakkasan is AMAZING. GO. Seriously. I'm not even going to bother writing anything else about it - GO!

The staff has always been friendly and helpful to us and efficient in checking us in, even earlier than the usual check in time if the room is available sooner.

Nothing really specially about the hotel 
Not a high end hotel to have luxury good times.

I finished the class and wanted to hang out on the strip and see some friends. Sounds like fun right? So I made reservations with Travelocity back in August for this trip and then changed the room to accommodate some friends. 

So when I checked in, I had to deal with Stuart, no last name. He was an older man with gray hair and a comb over. He asked for my name and I proceeded to give it to him. He asked for my ID to which I gave it to him and he looked at the picture. He then asked for my credit card to swipe for the room in case I charge or use anything in the room. AFTER he swipes the card, he checks the card and sees my name. He then asks how I am related to ""Paul"". EXCUSE ME? Paul? Who the f--- is Paul? I told him I'm not Paul and told him he should know that as he checked my ID. Turns out, he only looked at the photo, not the name. Well it turns out that for some odd reason my change with Travelocity somehow didn't register on the MGM computers. Rather than being helpful, Stuart banished me from the front of the line so I would have to take care of it myself. 

After an hour of being on the phone and waiting for Travelocity to clarify things with MGM, I got my room. The room WASN'T the suite that I made a reservation for, and it was smaller than expected. It was a short trip and I was going to be on the strip more than I was going to be in the room so whatever. 

Well, I went home to settle my receipts and check my bills and it turns out that I had a $250 charge on my credit card to MGM when I already paid for the room back in August. I thought it was odd that I have the charge so I called and they told me it was charged to ""Paul"" who was staying there at the same time. I told the woman that I have no idea who ""Paul"" is other than he had the same last name and was scheduled to stay there the same time I was. Well she stated she would remove the charge. I thought it was the end of it. 

So what happens? I get a message today that because my card was swiped, she couldn't remove the charge. So I have to call her back tomorrow to find out what happened because she was out of the office by 4pm (lucky). I'm not mad at ""LaDonna"". Based on her message, the credit card was swiped for ""Paul"" and therefore links me to him. What sucks is I'm paying for ""Paul's"" stay in Vegas and the fault lies on Stuart, the old deaf guy who didn't hear my correct name and somehow came up with the name ""Paul"" instead of my actual name! I'm upset with Stuart because he asked for my ID, proceeded to look for it, yet he didn't bother to see if my name matched what he heard. Instead, he did it after he swiped my credit card, so I now have a charge for a room that I didn't stay in for a person I don't even know. I'm upset that Stuart was lazy and rude and in no way polite to me whatsoever! Yes, there was a mix up with Travelocity, but Stuart was rude. Stuart ended up charging me for a room to which I didn't stay. He is wrong because he identified me as ""Paul"" and NEVER apologized for it! I am left with this stupid charge that I have to fight against tomorrow morning, wasting my time when I don't need to! Stuart is the epitome of bad service! This was the first time I decided to stay at MGM. I've enjoyed playing in the casino so I thought I would stay there and see what it's like. Instead, because of Stuart, I have NO intention of staying there again. I am also likely to go elsewhere to gamble and eat. I'm not made of a lot of money, but I still think I deserve common courtesy where ever I go. Stuart clearly messed up and in no way apologized for it and that is wrong! 

I will update this with whatever happens with the false credit card charges, but Stuart ruined my short stay at MGM and never apologized! I expect better from this hotel. What a jackass!

UPDATE: I was told that because the card was swiped, they will not remove the charge! Lame! Someone else stayed for free on my dime! I don't think that's fair.  So I was told I have to call my credit card to dispute the charge and they are graciously investigating it.  All in all, I think Stuart did a horrible job.  To take someone's ID and not check the name with the face?!?! What's the point in taking it from me to check then? That's sloppy work and because of that, I have to spend my time cleaning up HIS mess! Inexcusable! I am thoroughly disappointed with MGM.  I liked the casino prior to all of this and that made me decide to stay, but this experience with inefficiency and me having to clean up THEIR mess makes me NEVER want to stay here again and deal with the hassle.  I appreciate my credit card for being so helpful, but MGM dropped the ball BIG TIME in my eyes! Don't waste your effort staying here, there are PLENTY of better hotels on the strip!",6,2,1

Ummmmmm.....NO. We booked a Bungalo Suite with two queen beds. The room was MAD DIRTY. Toe nails on the floor, weed stems and bottle caps is what we were greeted with. Wallpaper peeling off the walls and dirty ass towels. 

When we pulled up to the valet the first guy was courteous then the bell hop came along. He didnt take our bags out of the car we loaded them onto the cart. Then he stood there and told us that they all work separately. Which meant ""you need to tip me not just the other guy"" then he stood there and waited. He would not move until we gave him a tip he thought was satisfactory....jackass. I mean we were going to tip him anyway. That was just rude.

Other issues: the showers suck. Ran out of hot water half way through my shower and it's basically just water being shot out of a pipe. 
We got ""vip"" treatment at Studio 54 and they had an open bar untill 11. The drinks were suuuuper weak and the people were lame as hell. They were fun to watch...but lame as hell. So we left..

Most recently I stated here for the Lady Gaga concert and it was just about the perfect place for our Supermodel Documentary Hour before the show. 

The next morning we ran into a bit of a hiccup when the housekeeping barged in at 9am with no real wait after knocking. At $200\/night with a discount, needless to say I was pissed. I called down to the front desk, where they took off the resort fee. $25 back in my pocket...thanks MGM! 

Another complaint is the fact that for seven full days after the stay, a $128 pending charge was on my credit card. I had paid in advance and the waived resort fee was only supposed to be $25, so $128 was not looking pretty every time I logged in. Eventually it was dropped, but why hold so much money for so long?

THE GOOD:
1. New remodeled rooms are large and super nice for the price...that rhymed. Even without the Yelp deal its still a good value. 
2. The room across from ours had a Bachelor Party going on. It was loud whenever their door opened, then immediately silent once the door closed. EXCELLENT sound insulation in these rooms! 
3. Free comfy bathrobe, free Veuve Clicquot champagne(reg $47retail\/$120 room service!), and free dessert waiting for us in the room on the 2nd night...did the Yelp discount code have something to do with this? ;-)

THE BAD:
1. TV reception was spotty and they couldn't fix it, but did offer to switch us to a different room.

Here are some useful tips for thrifty tourist! lol

1. I brought my own coffee and coffee maker since they don't have them at the room. There are Starbucks at the hotel but I normally wants coffee first thing in the morning without leaving my room so this was better for me. No fridge, no microwave. I also brought cup noodle thing for late night snack. Bring a water bottle and always carry them. I always get mine filled at restaurant every time. I drink a lot of water! At night I fill bottle with ice so I have cold water to drink in the morning. Hotel has store but they are sold at high price of course.

2. Carry a plastic bag on you on the way to your hotel room when you first get there, stop at ice machine and get ice then. The walk to our room was pretty long from ice machine.


3.Our check out time was 11am, our flight didn't leave until 5pm so we hang out at the pool area.We checked out using their TV in the room, Keep your room key card bacause you need it to get into pool area, they  have a place to store your luggage at the lobby so just carry minimum of what you need for the pool. They have towel and shower you can rinse but it's one of those outside shower so you need to dry and change in bathroom. Shower is located right next to bathroom! We did find seats for us by shower area, there are enough trees that gave us good shade. Those are free but Cabana or umbrella cost. They check your bag at the pool entry, I didn't bring in food just my water bottle it was ok. I don't know if it's allowed or not but he didn't say anything. Worst case just dump it out :)   There were a lot of people but me and friend just wanted to stay there and didn't leave so no need to use lockers for valuables. Locker costs $10 not so big either. So just remember what's important to bring :)  They have food, just know it's hotel price. But Nacho was good size so price wasn't bad I thought. We had nacho ( Big enough size to share maybe 3 or 4 people? ) and chicken tender with fries. ( A few strips and came with fries? Not too sure ) 

4. Get UBER and LYFT app. Get sign up bonus credit!! We each for both apps for the first time and used free credit so ended up paying like $4 my money during this trip! Not bad at all!! Make sure to tip the driver! It was our first time with these driving service and I was pleased! Hotel has spots for those services for convenience. ( Basement ? B1? When you are at the lobby you will see signs directing to UBER, kinda thing ) 

5. Breakfast buffet is high price, went to Denny's around the corner ( 5 min walking or less? ) Good steak and eggs I loved!!  They have Ross or Marshall , ABC store where I bought something cheaper than Hotel of course

6. We bought show tickets beforehand on some website. Turns out ( Cirque Du Soleil we watched ) they had plenty left and were sold at the hotel and it was like $30 cheaper per ticket. But I don't know it could be sold out fast so you decide! Show was great and that was my favorite.

7. Casino was open 24hrs I think? I went there after midnight and it was so much fun!  I mean you have to try it when you are in Vegas. I did slot machine and Roulette. For slot machine Just put bill in the machine which I didn't know and then start playing. When you are done just hit cash out and it spits out a piece of paper with amount of money you have, take it to kiosk kinda spot and get your money!

Well.. can you just credit the rooms instead? 

No.. just the $100 credit for both rooms each night so you have a total $400.

I called front desk several times about it as it affects breathing and they sent me a service man at 1:00 in the morning. Really? You said right away at 9:00 and he shows up banging on my door atv v1:00 am only to tell me the thermostat cant go below 65.  I'm so undecided if I would go back here or not.

We got to our room on the 22nd floor without any hassle. The room itself was gorgeous. The view was incredible. We had two queen sized beds full of fluffy pillows and amazing comforters. After nights spent gambling and partying it was very refreshing to be able to come back to a comfortable beds.

The hotel is huge. It's easy to get lost, but there are signs throughout the hotel to help you on your way, plus the staff is really friendly. This hotel has a great selection of restaurants and nightlife from clubs to lounges and they have cute shops too. They have a few different pools, but they can get pretty crowded. I recommend getting there before noon if you plan on swimming, before it gets too crowded.

We visit Las Vegas yearly for our anniversary. For our 17th we returned to MGM Grand (where we spent our honeymoon). We have stayed at MGM Grand 15-20 times and various MGM Grand properties perhaps 40 times. Fabulous trip other than morose clerk & buffet.

MGM has a beautiful grand pool complex, several pools,lazy river, whirlpools, waterfalls, beach shops, 5 bars & outdoor restaurant + 2 additional adult pools (The Wet Republic (PRICEY, long lines, loud, impolite staff & questionable practices), and a private pool which requires a fee (the fee is for the padded chairs, nice quite beautiful area). I recommend all of the pools, (including rental of pod, cabanas, day bed, most pod, Cabana, day bed rates are a food and beverage minimum that you may spend anyway and on busy days spend a half hour of more looking for a chair crammed in with a bunch of other people) With the EXCEPTION of The Wet Republic, NEVER The Wet Republic.

Our planes were delayed, thus arrived several hours late & our room of choice was gone but the reservation desk promised that we could move to a Wellness room or Suite in the morning after 11:00 am. At 11:00 am there were tremendous lines. We were guided to the Wellness office to check in for VIP. The pompous snippy clerk at the Wellness office said even though we are M Life Gold Members with an M Life Credit card they no longer honor room upgrades, we received a lower level strip view room NOT a wellness room or suite. 

MGM has an outstanding huge casino, beautiful pools, inviting spa (pricey) and salon, outstanding sports book (we bet on & watched the Predators game), convenient essentials (pricy) shops, excellent concierge service (you may purchase tickets for any of the MGM properties), descent shopping, fine, casual, buffet and in room dining, Starbucks and other quick bites, & uber, cab and limo's available.

We were staying for several days, and planned on being able to keep drinks and possibly leftovers to reheat later, since we planned to do a ""foodie tour"" of Vegas. (We're not rich people and planned on doing very little gambling.) Upon check-in, we learned that there were no refrigerators (except the ones stocked with egregiously priced ""amenities"") or microwaves in our room, despite the upgrade we paid for. On top of that, we were charged a $400 ""deposit fee"", despite the fact that we had already paid for our room in full, AND a ""resort fee"" despite the fact that we didn't use the resort. So basically, they took half of our trip money. The Staywell room was just a typical room, I've stayed in other towns for WAY less money and had FAR more amenities. (Seriously, what kind of greedy establishment charges $25\/day for a refrigerator?!) We thought about getting room service, but the prices were absolutely offensive...($18 for chips and salsa that cost like $5 at the store and then they add on a $4.99 ""fee"" for God knows what per person AND a gratuity?!) The hotel offered a lot of really great restaurants that weren't so desperate for money, but I would NEVER stay here again.

This hotel was dated and sad on the interior.
This was my 1st time in Vegas and came recommended due to its history of events. 

Check-in was sufficient but the clerk was not overly friendly. My husband told him it was my birthday weekend and what could he offer. Well the clerks response was we USED to give a bottle of champagne and chocolates but we don't anymore. He gave us a $20 voucher to the onsite bakery. Well it's Vegas so $20 didn't cover anything.
 
The room was clean but had strange wiring near the TV that looked like maybe a VCR sat there at one time or another. 

The fridge was supposed to be fully stocked with alcohol l however my husband noticed 5 bottles missing. He called the front desk and they acknowledged the missing items. Well guess what they put it on our bill the next day. We had to dispute it and I informed them they need to have better hiring practices since I am pretty sure the maid staff may have taken it.
They eventually took it off the bill but not a fun part to our stay.

I was not impressed and think the hotel needs a MAJOR update ASAP.

this place is huge!; the story about getting lost in the casino rings true here; I actually got locked out of the place during my exploring, but luckily an employee rescued me and let me into the adjacent convention center (which is quite grand as well); there is a walkway to the 3 Signature Towers of high-end condos; the outdoor\/pool areas are extensive & top notch; love the massive hotel lobby with the classic MGM lion sculpture; many scenic high end eateries, including 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants; the West End bar is kind of dark & sexy and tucked away, but not always open; armies of hotties headed to Hakkasan nightclub - wowza!; best craft beer bet = Michael Mina's Pub 1842 for sure, but you will pay to play!; Tap Sports Bar also has a few, but prices aren't much better there",2,0,1

At check-in, I asked for a higher floor or nicer view because we're celebrating a birthday but the rep didn't even crack a smile and said there's nothing available. She put us in the West Wing where the rooms are updated to a more modern\/hip design. But the work was pretty poorly done and room was not well maintained at all. There were at least 3 light bulbs that were out, the sink didn't drain well, bathroom fixture was falling apart, the ironing board was broken, and so was the wall hook for our towel\/clothes. Plus side is that I have a really high cleanliness standard for hotel, and everything seems to be alright.

The front desk was RUDE and the ""package deal"" only happens if you charge things to your room... which costs 200$. Silly lady wouldn't even explain properly even though there was no line behind us (was it was 1am). Rude people should not be at the front desk. Maybe scrubbing floors... 

My friend and I reserved a smoking room (not for me...) but we were given a non-smoking room. When asked about this they said they would just send up ash-trays. Interesting, but atleast they were given the okay to smoke. 

When I called to ask the name of the person who said it was okay to smoke so we wouldn't be charged they rushed into saying we wouldn't be charged and wouldn't give me a name. For hospitality ""specialists"" they were not hospitable.

The bathroom toilet leaked. We had requested a higher floor but were given a 4th floor room with a view of the A\/C and rock roof. Nice for LV I guess... if you like rocks.

I knew what things to expect: no fridge, no coffee maker, resort fees, long walks to parking garage, and small rooms in West Wing.  So - my review is not based on these things.  I stayed for 4 nights and wished I would have asked for some sort of upgrade.  
The line to check in was quite long.  I believe longer than usual because of a large group of college kids.  The staff was very nice.  
After the long walk from front desk to our room... walked in and noticed that someone had urinated in ""our clean bathroom"" and left it unflushed.  I am assuming that housekeeping just overlooked this.  The shower floor was slimy.  The water never got hot.  We called and they told us to run it for 10 minutes.  Okay - it got lukewarm.  
The bathroom counter is more of a ledge.  There is no room to put anything.  There is the crazy design of glass doors to the shower and toilet beside each other.  Basically you can hear any and everything going on in the bathroom.  Why is there a phone in the bathroom? 
Bed was pretty comfortable but had a stained comforter.  
Nice flat screen tv but for some reason, some channels lost a signal.  
There are mirrors everywhere.  Not a complaint - just strange.  
Would I stay here again? Probably not.  I enjoyed the casino.  And I enjoyed the location.  I liked the access to the monorail.

As guests we park our car in the hotel's self parking and were told at check-in the fee is $12 per day. We had to pay for the parking upfront to get unlimited in\/out or every time we left we had to pay $12.

It was only for their  mini bar items, but for $25 a day we could rent a refrigerator from housekeeping. I called room service and asked for coffee. The carafe was $18 and I was told it would be an additional $6.85 to deliver it to our room. Really!!! $24.85 for a carafe of coffee! As for the TV in the room, it continues to turn off and have a message ""no signal.""  Maintenance checked it out for us and said this is normal. He blamed it on a modem not functioning properly.

The only negative would be that there is supposed to be a staff member directing you to the next available check in station but there was not anyone there. So, I walk up to what looks like an available station only to be told by the employee that they were not ready yet and was directed to rejoin the line. If you're not going to have someone telling guests where to go to check in, at least have a sign saying to wait for assistance.

Our booking included 2 free buffets that in order to redeem you must charge to your room. The buffet charges were not removed from my bill and my credit card was promptly charged for about $65. I was on hold with their customer service line for 15 minutes with no answer. I sent an email to customer service asking for my refund and upon submission of the form was advised I'd get a response in 7-10 days. Wow. 

I would skip the buffet if I ever come here again as it was very hit and miss -- not worth the price. There are plenty of other dining options in this hotel to try in lieu of the buffet.

Our room was clean and comfortable. The only downside is that there is no refrigerator for personal use so forget about any leftovers or snacks that you over pay for to eat later unless you'd like to rent a fridge for $25\/day. 

We had a red eye flight and checked out about 10 hours before we had to be at the airport. The hotel does offer luggage storage so that was nice. However, we didn't have enough things planned to fill up 10 hours so we found ourselves looking for a place to relax.. which does not exist. The lobby is huge with no place to sit. We were stuck in the food court or in one of the many bars. Keep in mind people are allowed to smoke in the casino and bars, so for non smokers, it was pretty awful to spend several hours in the bar because there was no other option.

MGM has some amazing food though. Went to Nob Hill and had some of the best fries ever, accompanied by a Dark 'n Stormy.

Also visited The Grand Wok and had an amazing cocktail. Was tart and tasty for sure.

Since I was a hotel guest, I'll speak to that first. Our grand queen comfortably fit four ladies and our stuff. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean and the décor was stylish but basic. I really liked the remote control blinds that had varying levels of darkness. 

We did have two issues with the room though.  The handle of the shower that controls the temperature fell off during my first shower. I had to jam it back on while trying to not freeze or burn myself. Maintenance was called to handle the issue and it was fine after that. We also had to call maintenance because the AC just didn't seem to cool down the room. It got better, but it was never really perfect. 

In terms of entertainment, MGM was excellent. Wet Republic and Hakkasan on one property? Yes, please! Although we never made it to Wet Republic, I wish we did since Calvin Harris was there during the visit. Our group left the property a little too much considering all that was going on at ""home."" I wandered through the MGM Grand pool area at one point and wish I carved out a little time to just hang out there. I also visited an array of the other bars\/lounges on the property. They all kind of looked the same but served the purpose. 

As for food, I only ate at Fiamma and Hecho en Vegas. While neither were my favorite, I appreciate the convenience and variety of options for casual to fine dining. I struggled a bit in the late night and quick bite category. McDonald's and a pizzeria toting itself as New York style don't quite cut it for late night in my personal opinion. I also struggled to find a healthier breakfast option and ended up at Starbucks. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't travel across the country to eat at a chain with 20 locations near my home. 

I'm being a little nitpicky, but overall I really enjoyed my stay at the MGM Grand. It was a nice hotel with a lot to offer. You wouldn't need to twist my arm to get me to stay there again.",5,1,3

The room had no hot water the whole duration of my stay. I called the front desk twice and service technicians came in to fix the problem however it was never fixed. The water was ice cold no matter what time of day we turned on the shower. My friends were taking sponge baths in the sink and we were also using a friends shower whose room was on another floor. Inconvenient to say the least. The resort fees totaling $119 were removed from my final bill for the trouble but I feel like they could've done more. I had paid extra to upgrade the room and I expect to have hot water when I turn on the shower. Also no coffee makers in the room either. I will stay somewhere else on my next trip to Vegas.,0,0,0

For posterity's sake, his gaffe goes on the official ledger here. Luckily, there wasn't a major convention in town and the fine young lady at reception was nice enough to help us out and get us properly situated.

The MGM looks a lot different since I'd been here last, and I still remember the now-defunct MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park that we hit up as kids. Rest in peace, yo.

Bullets? Bullets.

- The location at the south side of the strip makes it convenient for airport arrival\/departure, but puts the MGM a 20-30 min walk to the central area.
- The casino floor is huge, and just walking from the lobby to the book is a hike. Dealers were nice, plenty of tables.
- The book is sizable but is placed in a narrow corridor making standing room or backseat viewing quite difficult to virtually impossible. Enclosed space also makes it smokier than other books.
- Close proximity to casual mall-style dining, as well as fine-dining, including the dual Robuchon restaurants. L'Atelier did not disappoint but that goes in another review.
- Saw both families and adults migrating to the pool area and ""lazy river."" Didn't go, but it's supposed to be nice and has generally favorable reviews on Yelp.
- No trendy nightclub, but the terribly named Hakkasan is set to open in 2013.
- Overall service was solid to above-average with the exception of a curiously strange lost & found guy that was almost thoroughly unhelpful.
- Renovations look nice, no complaints about the room.
- Trying to throw in in-room movie charges was sneaky but doesn't fly with our Asian bookkeeping, son.
- $25 resort fee. Whatever. Hoped you liked that WatchESPN streaming.",4,2,2

Sure it's newer, has a more modern design, but what they forget to mention is that it's about a mile away from the elevators.  Also for a 'modern room', you can't hide a 20"" CRT style tv inside a box and trick people into believing it's a flat screen tv.  it's like putting lipstick on a pig.

With that aside, the MGM isn't all bad.  good restaurants, solid strip location and when they have some specials, it's a pretty solid deal.  we had an offer for 129 for sat night and it came with a $100 dining credit at Aria.

However on this last trip we felt let down. The hotel facilities are still impressive but the room we got given wasn't. We were placed at the end of a corridor beneath one of the terrace suites where there was a party nightly which we could clearly hear from our room. Now we know we are in vegas and are happy for people to party but we felt the hotel could have done something to lessen the noise. We were offered the first three nights of our five night stay for free but as yet have still not been credited. On top of this the maids never came to clean our room for the first couple of days despite asking housekeeping to have it done, in turn we had no toilet roll and dirty towels.
To top it off the room felt tatty and dirty (marks on bed linen, filthy windows and blown bulbs in the bathroom).
When we received our PDF bill we had cabana charges added to our bill, yet we never charge to our room and didn't rent a cabana!

The room was a one king bed deluxe room.  The room itself was fairly ordinary, though spacious.  There is neither a microwave nor refrigerator (other that the one stocked with expensive drinks) available in the room.  The channel selection available on the TV was rather limited and features no premium channels.  Though, we did not spend a great deal of time in our room watching TV, so that was not a deal breaker.  

The view from our 15th floor room was good will a window that ran the full width of the room.  The window featured a drop down blackout curtain that did an excellent job of blocking out outside light.  The biggest weakness of the room was the front door.  It featured no latchable lock on the inside and it also blocked no sound from the hallway.  We were often awoken in the middle of the night by people returning to their rooms after late shows or parties.  The doors really need to be replaced with one that insulate better.

As for the hotel itself, the property is huge.  This was both a plus and minus.  On the plus side, the property featured an extensive gaming floor, lots of restaurants, shops and an extensive pool  complex.  However, the price for this is a lot of walking to get around.  The walk to the convention area is particularly remote from the rooms.  If you are there for a convention, you should count on at least a 10 minute walk from the central elevators to the convention area.

The casino area is central to the hotel, which means you have to walk through it to go just about anywhere in the hotel or even to enter and leave the hotel.  The smoke in the casino area is oppressively bad and we spent very little time gaming before giving up.  Even just walking through the casino area to get to different parts is an unpleasant experience.  The MGM isn't the worst on the strip, but it's certainly not good.

Overall, as a conference hosting hotel, it has a lot to offer with a large convention space and conference rooms (the conference I attended was on the order of 3500 people).  It also has a decent location surrounded by other MGM properties with lots of entertainment options within close walking distance.

However, if I were staying on my own for a pure recreational trip, I would probably book one of the other properties on the strip first.",0,0,0

Our credit card didn't go through and the agent in her rush to process us she said we should just leave it open. Not knowing that doing so would mean that we could not use the internet.  Our room was really far away from the elevator and it was apparent that the hotel had undergone renovations and the side of the hotel that we were on had obviously not been apart of the upgrade.

I have been twice before this year alone staying at MGM related hotels (Mandalay Bay and Caesar's) and I simply cannot believe the service this time.  First of all, I bought a package deal with hotel and ticket to the closed circuit viewing party for the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight.  I go to pick up my tickets and they have done a bait and switch on me and put me in a different viewing location at the Monte Carlo.  The purpose of me staying at MGM and getting the package was so that I wouldn't have to leave the hotel.  I waited 20 minutes for someone to finally give me the tickets that I received which were absolutely horrible.  My seats were all the way to the left side; you could not see the picture head on from any projector (there were three).  This section should not have even been sold as viable. In a concert, this section would have been closed. I am disappointed that they would treat their guests like this who bought in advance.  Don't even get me started on our room.  Wallpaper peeling from the walls, we got a room in the section that obviously wasn't renovated, no hot water for the shower (luckily it was 109 degrees so I didn't necessarily want a steamy shower), the AC even at 65 degrees never got cold enough.  It was just a disaster.  I have other choices in Vegas and from now on, I'll be using them.  And no, I didn't have time to complain because I was making the best of my trip and didn't want to spend time talking to MGM staff, switching rooms, asking for better tickets, etc.  We spent over $1300 in two days with rooms, meals, etc. at MGM.

The one thing MGM has going for them as relief for the summer heat is Wet Republic, their pool\/daytime club. I think the drinks and admission during peak season is probably absurd for me. Bummer. Reasonably cute ladies tend to get drinks and extra perks here for free.

First and foremost I need to point out something I thoroughly enjoyed about the casino here: it actually smelled good! It wasn't that smoky and it didn't have that nasty cleaning solution smell that the others did. The size of this place did not bother me at all, to be honest I did so much walking in and out of random casinos that I couldn't even tell MGM was any bigger. A huge plus for me was the food court with Del Taco and Weinerschnitzel next door. Greeeeat drunk food. The casino does not disappoint, and there are quite a few restaurant choices inside (the buffet, Shibuya, and Seablue are recommended). Studio 54 is also a fun place to go clubbing, although I would steer clear of Tabu. Overall, the fun factor of the MGM Grand was pretty solid. 

On to the room: The room was a good size and I got a pretty good deal, but one thing I was disappointed with is that they put me on the 4th floor. No view at all. I asked to be moved up and with a strip view, but was told I would have to try to switch rooms the next day after 11AM. I made my reservation 3 months prior, but I guess when you stay here you should tack on another 3 months to get a good view. The room was only a couple rooms away from the elevators which later proved to be beneficial for the drunken nights\/mornings we had, so I ended up keeping it even though the view lacked. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The room was quiet and the curtains were thick enough to block all outside light so when I did get a few hours of sleep they were uninterrupted.

But I'm actually pretty shocked at our experience at the hotel.  The hotel casino & lobby area was pretty and glitzed up for Christmas \/ Boxing.  But our experience was marred by a failure of the customer service apparatus at every level even for a Gold+ member from beginning to end.

We came here as a family with 4 rooms during the slow time before Christmas.  So when we booked via my Gold status on the MLife site, I even called in to make sure they were nearby or connected.  When we arrived, the line for the Gold+ level members only had 1 person while the regular line was really long.  The request was lost (go figures) so our kind receptionist tried her best to find rooms closer together.  But after 30 minutes (and by that time the regular line already cleared out :-( ), she had to downgrade one of my rooms to make it work.  She even mentioned that she had to deal with many very irate people pissed that Hakkasan was closed but nobody let them know when they booked.  I'm not a clubber but who's running the MGM ship? That grueling check-in gave a bad omen on the stay already...

So our rooms smelled like light smoke but we were so tired from check-in, we didn't want to go through that ordeal again.  Let me list what went sideways instead of writing it out.
1) Our bathroom light was broken.  We called but it never got fixed
2) Our Shower temperature handle was broken.  It either got super hot or cold.  Never got fixed
3) On our second night, my wife wanted to have a bubble bath.  Black water came out of the tub spout.  I had a black-humor laugh at my wife's expense. 
4) Asked for housekeeping to spray the room to clean out the smoke smell.  Since they didn't do #1 or #2, just a guess they didn't do this as well.  They told me to call sooner if we smell smoke to catch smokers in the act in the hallway.  It felt like my old days playing Bad-Cop RA.  I don't want to be a snitch to get a smoke-free room!

Also, Avoid the 4th floor.  You're at the roof level and its a little awkward greeting workmen through your window in the morning in your nighties.  Needless to say, we had the shades down the whole time after that.

Needless to say, I'm giving low ratings not for the broken things in the room since I understand Vegas.  I'm giving it for the customer service promising service but never delivering.  If a MLife Tier member had to deal with this, I wonder how the regular peasantry feel...",17,3,1

First of all, the service here is second to none - from the front desk peeps to management to audio\/visual guys to wait staff. I had a chance to talk to some of them and learned that many had worked here forever because they're treated so well. Not something you hear too much of nowadays.

As for the hotel rooms, I can't say enough about the beds. They are like big fluffy clouds and one of the few places where I can sleep like the baby I am. Apparently, they've renovated all their rooms so I'll have to go back soon to check them out.

The first time I coordinated a corporate event here, they offered two free tix to KÀ by Cirque du Soleil!! Sweet deal! And it turned out to be one of the best ones I've ever seen so if you get a chance to go, GO!!",1,1,1

The highlight of the room was the quality bedding, the only disappointment was an old and non-elegant shower head which sprayed too little water too hard.  So really, I have nothing to complain about.

The location is central on the strip and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel.  For late night entertainment you have Tabu (an ""ultra lounge"") which looked promising.  Then there is the classic Studio 54 which offers good dancing to a wide variety of music (as long as you don't mind a circle of older lechy looking gentlemen ringing around the dance floor).

Usually we stay at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. We drove all around the huge complex until we stumbled across an employee who directed us to the front of the hotel. We pulled in and had our luggage loaded up and checked in to the bell station. I felt the bell man pressured me into tipping him because he kept saying ""I won't see you again"". He wasn't the person who takes your luggage to your room, that's another person. Ok, so now we have to check in, the line took about 45 minutes (at 5pm, check in at 3), but was at least moving and good music videos on huge screens kept us entertained. On to the room, pretty nice and easy to find. Clean and cool with a decent strip view. Could never figure out the mini fridge, but the blackout shade was awesome. The room smelled smoky from time to time which was gross and although the rooms were straightened up and decent each day, housekeeping must not have a vacuum because anything that fell on the floor or was there when we got there, stayed there all week. The pool, sadly, was a disappointment. The check in at the entrance was just a flash of the room card and then we made a beeline to the lazy river. We rented tubes that were HUGE and $10 each for the day, only credit or room charge, no cash. We ended up getting one tube taken from us when we went into another pool, but because of the size we were actually relieved. The lazy river was not all that was promised. It reeked of chlorine, our eyes burned all night. Drunk adults lined the entire mile blocking the fun of a pool that carries you through. Me and my kids were pushed hard at different times by adults who were walking through the river like they were rushing to get somewhere. The entire pool was lined with empty beer cans and bottles that fell into the pool! There were also lots of folks walking through the lazy river holding their cans and bottles just above the water. We enjoyed the regular pools better but those were lined with beer cans and bottles too. I don't care that folks are drinking, it's Vegas, but they should have at least one person on staff to scoop that mess up all day. A lightening storm cut our pool time short and we never returned to the pools again. We tried to eat at the Rainforest Cafe but the wait was 2.5 hours. So, we drove south of the strip to a variety of other casual dining spots all week. The Avenue Cafe in the MGM was ok. $60 for an omelette, kid's waffle and a BLT. Clean. Nothing but eggs after noon, no other breakfast items available. Best meal was Bucca de Beppo at the Excalibur (yucky hotel and people, but great food and server named David). Must buy\/try are cupcakes from the Corner Cakes in the MGM Grand Tower. All in all, not bad, but we'll be sticking with Mandalay Bay for our family-friendly Vegas jaunts.",0,0,0

My wife and I usually stay at The Cosmopolitan, but we decided to stay somewhere cheaper this trip because the Cosmo was pushing $1000 for two nights.

Here are a few reasons why I'll never go back to the MGM:

Paper-thin walls: My wife and I had the pleasure of listening to our neighbors puking.

Starbucks: My wife had a free ""birthday drink"" loaded to her Starbucks card. After waiting in line for quite a long time, she scanned her card and it took money off of her gift card and didn't honor the free drink because they are not a ""corporate"" location (not sure how we were supposed to know this). We had to wait in the long line AGAIN, and then wait for someone to be called up that could issue a refund. Ridiculous.

Tiny rooms: Our room was clean, but was very small (tower room). We did have somewhat of a ""strip view"", but there's not much to look at south of the MGM, which is where our room faced. The room was also clean which was a plus.

Fees: Parking fees, resort fees, $8 6-pack of Oreos, etc. This is pretty common in Vegas, but it still bothers me. We stayed two nights and owed close to $100 on top of what we already paid for the room.

The people: Nice mixture of classy and trashy.

Walking: This place is HUGE, so walking from the parking garage to the room can be quite a feat. If you're going to charge me for parking, at least make it convenient! You could probably park at the Tropicana at no cost and have a shorter walk.",4,2,1

The surprising $200 security deposit was ridiculous, but hopefully they give us our money back tomorrow when we check out, and payed a $28 a day resort fee. The resort fee we knew about, and security deposit we didn't know was going to be so high. The hotel room was nice, modern. I didn't enjoy the bathroom too much because it's see through hazy green glass walls with little privacy, which isn't a big deal to couples. The wifi and cell reception is TERRIBLE. Couldn't log in wifi with any device. I made phone calls and had to stay in one little corner of the room  because if I wal ked any where else my call would drop. The hotel itself just too big.

I actually considered giving it 4 stars, but the pool issues forced me to only up it to 3 stars..more on that later.

We booked through Vegas.com and had some issues with them (mainly that we booked 2 double queens, but they wrote it down as a double queen and a king and told us we basically had to wait until we got to the hotel to ask them to fix it). Fast forward--we arrived at the hotel right around 3pm on Friday and the line to check in was LONG, but it moved REALLY FAST this time because they had ""line helpers"" directing traffic, etc. For some reason, probably because we're so beautiful (lol jk) we were taken into the fancy diamond check in room from the regular line. Whisked away from all the riff-raff ;-) we were offered waters and apples and told stories of the celeb. check ins of the day (it was Billboard Music Award weekend). We explained our room reservation issues to the guy and he immediately said he could switch the rooms to queens, but then we told him that we really wanted adjoining rooms and he explained that the only adjoining rooms they have are a double queen room connected to a king room. We decided that adjoining for our party of 6 was more important than double queens, so we went with that (but we were charged an extra $15 a day for the king). 

Once at the rooms we discovered they were large, clean (unlike in my previous review when I found hairs everywhere), and in good shape. It was clear their rooms has been recently upgraded as gone were the chipped furniture, stained carpet, and cracked tile--KUDOS!

The A\/C worked well in the room and the bed itself was fine, but OMG THE PILLOWS ARE STILL HORRIBLE!! We all woke up with neck aches! Boooo

While staying there we ate at 2 of their restaurants- Avenue Cafe and Hecho En Vegas. Hecho in Vegas continues to be one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas and Avenue continues to be an easy option to eat breakfast at while staying at the MGM--food ok, service a little worse than ok. 

On to the reason for 3 stars instead of 4 stars--the pool! Okay, so our issues: at noon on Saturday there was not ONE CHAIR AVAILABLE for our party of 6 to even put our stuff on. They charge $15 for a TINY LOCKER, and..the worst offender of all...$24 for a .99 cent inner tube for the lazy river!!!! SERIOUSLY?! TWENTY-FOUR DOLLARS ARE YOU SH*TING ME?!?!???!??! After paying hundreds of dollars to STAY at the hotel?! Honestly, out of control!

I can forgive the no chairs thing (I guess). If you want to get a chair on a Saturday apparently you have to line up at like 8:30am to enter the pool area at 9am. I cannot, however, forgive the locker and inner tube fees, they are simply astronomical.

It is far from many activities happening in the middle of the strip though you can take a shuttle train - however good thing about staying at MGM is that you don't need to go outside MGM - it is self contained. Which is good for a repeat visitor to LV or anyone  who wants to avoid walking the strip or sightseeing  - and just wants to chill within the MGM parameters. It has it's own shows - I loved KA which was spectacularr. It has it's own nightclubs and famous chef good restaurants. 
BEST are the window vents which allow fresh outside air into the room. 
Bathroom was updated modern. Quality body lotion and shampoo\/conditioner. Don't like the shower water trickle. Makes it difficult to wash long hair.

Also, the prices for the rooms seem to be consistently mid range despite it being so popular. They must attract a lot of high rollers. 

The plethora of Michelin rated eateries is very impressive. Even the non-Michelin rated restaurants are pretty impressive. I have been to Pearl, Emeril's, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, and Wolfgang Puck's. I have just scratched the surface and will try more in the future for sure. 

The rooms were pretty nice when I stayed here a few years ago. Moderately sized and clean. 

The only thing that really bugs about this casino is the extremely long hikes from the front of the hotel to the back where all the restaurants are. Even from the valet station, it's pretty far. Everything is so far apart. I guess that's how they get you to play. You get tired from walking, sit down at a machine, and say, what the heck and play a $100 while you rest. Good strategy.

Basic King room is super modern and clean (thus the 3 stars), but tiny. Toilet and shower are separate glass doors that both step right into the main room entrance. No privacy and no sound insulation! Worked for me and my husband, but I'm glad the days I spent with my girlfriends were with a different hotel. Also, the hotel is enormous, so you have to walk through what feels like miles of narrow and dark corridor to reach your room.

The main issue, however, is the service. The taxi line is 20-30 minutes on a crowded sidewalk, and not just during peak hours - always! Our best technique was walking across the street to Hooters and catching a cab there, with no wait! The bell desk line is also ridiculous at checkout, and when we came to pick up our bags later that afternoon it took 30 minutes to get them back and the staff kept forgetting who we were or that we had already given them our bag ticket. Maybe if you looked up when we talk it would be easier?

The room I got this last time was much smaller and although there was a complete renovation of all the rooms done, this room felt cramped and fragile. The glass doors were not lined up exactly, so if you closed the door to the toilet, it would rub the contact area with the hinge, which was also glass. I understand modern design, but it just seemed really cramped. In addition, you would think with the room renovations done, they would have thought to upgrade the cardio room to an actual fitness center.

The key machine at the airport site was down so we had a short wait again at the hotel to get our keys, but they do have an ample number of check-in people always available (who were also helpful with questions throughout our stay as well).

We found the hotel to be quiet and very clean. TV was small & outdated, but we didn't watch much television anyway. Housekeeping staff was friendly and accommodating, as was the desk personnel when we checked out.

Downside to the MGM is it's size....gigantic. You get plenty of exercise walking to shops, restaurants, walkways to other casinos, and the monorail. But it's ALL there!
I do not like having to pay $20 a day for wifi we didn't use even once, but that's typical of all the resorts.

The club was alright, albeit too crowded with posers with Affliction shirts and hootie mamas with bell-shaped dresses and forever 21 dresses. The drinks were moderately priced and too strong for me. I ordered an Incredible Hulk and the drink was really strong. I'm guessing they added weed to the drinks to kept you buying.

The hotel itself was okay, with nice airy, clean rooms. There were pictures of long dead actors hanging on the walls and the bathrooms have ample towels. The drawback was that the elevators would take a long time on peak days. It would take several hours sometimes just to get an elevator without some dude with a boner standing behind you. The pool was nice, except the 3 feet depth and water that tasted like pee and bad body order. On several occasions, I swallowed some water while attempting a breast stroke. You have to watch out for little kids running around the place and fat people that have a size too small bathing suits. 

The restaurants inside the hotel is top notch, with restaurants catering to every price. Top tier restaurants to a McDonalds if you're on a budget.

Other than the not-so-tip-top-shape of the rooms, our stay here was better than satisfactory. We came here to stay for 3 nights for my sister's birthday, and we all had a good time. The rooms were decent, the beds were comfortable, and the rates we paid were fair.

The front desk check-in staff was really nice and accommodating, and allowed us to upgrade to suites for a minimal fee once the rooms became available.

We spent some time lazing around the Lazy River; which had waterfalls and a pretty decent current. Rent an inner tube, buy one of those huge daquiri drinks, and just lay back, allowing the current to carry you along the river's path. Make sure to watch out for the random places where water shoots out at you though...and the curtain of water at some point that you just can't avoid, no matter what you do.

Many of the dealers here are nice too; there was only one grouch at a roulette table, but then again, it was 4 in the morning, so oh well. Learned how to play craps finally, and the dealers were all very patient and helpful dealing with us newbies at the table. 

The only complaint I have is that the casino doesn't have any 25 cent Wheel of Fortune machines! Why?!?!

This was my first time in Vegas. We went to Vegas for a combined celebration of my wife's birthday and a belated Honeymoon. When we arrived, the girl checking us in said she could give us an upgrade in the room, but the room we had reserved had all the latest technology. Flat screen TV, Blu Ray, ETC.. the room she would move us into didn't have any of that. I didn't care, we took the upgrade. I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV, and to be honest I never turned it on. The room was nice enough; I didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room, just change clothes and sleep. I will say the huge king sized bed we had was very comfortable! Plus it had free WIFI. 

The shower was weird. I'm not a tall man, but I could not stand under the shower head. My wife is 5'4 and even she had issues with the height of the shower head location. It could have stood to be about a foot higher. Other than that, the bathroom was nice enough in the room. 

So why the low rating? The rest of the resort. 

This place is huge. After we checked in, we went to our room, unpacked, changed and went to hit the strip! We wanted to get onto Las Vegas Blvd... there where no signs or directions on how to get there. I walked around the casino, hotel, resort, going in circles when I finally found the concierge desk, I was annoyed, but I tried to make a joke of it by making fun of myself, I actually asked the concierge, ""How do I get out of this hotel?!"" They gave me a map and directions for me to get onto Las Vegas Blvd. After that I really didn't have too many problems, I was able to find my way in and out. This was another thing I didn't like After walking down the strip, especially at the end of the night, you are relieved to get to the hotel, only to have to walk what seems like a mile through crowds to get to the elevator bank. 

I didn't care for the atmosphere of the casino itself. It seems so stuffy and pretentious. I don't know, maybe I've seen too many movies, but it's not at all how I pictured a casino would look in Vegas. The staff was friendly when you could find one. A lot of times they would come around and ask if we wanted drinks only for us to never see them again. Or we would be playing for long periods of time before someone would ask if wanted a drink. 

And what is with all of the kids?! There were a ton of kids there. Who the heck brings kids to Vegas? I'm sorry, it only takes about a minute of walking up and down the strip to realize Vegas isn't exactly ""family friendly"". I'm not holding that against the hotel, it just has been bothering me. 

We had pre-paid for our rooms when we booked them, and then where surprised with an $18 (we booked and paid before they raised it, so we got the price at the time we booked) a night resort fee... and then they charged tax on top of it. Sure the $80 dollars is not going to break us, but still... that is like 3 drinks on the strip!

There are some really nice restaurants and bars in MGM now (see my reviews for Shibuya and Craftsteak) but again, this casino is so big it always takes forever to get through the hotel and crowds to get outside.

There was a TV with a lot of channels with some MGM-related information, and I liked the AC\/heater control. It was neat that there was a little mirror on the side of the bathroom whose position is adjustable; I found it very useful when I was putting contacts in my eyes. I also liked that they had power outlets on desks. In addition, a safe is in one of the drawers, which I put my valuables in whenever I left the room. Towels, a hair dryer, an iron, soap, and travel-sized lotion, shampoo, body wash, and conditioner were provided.

Self-parking was good in that there was a moderate amount of parking spaces available. There are a lot of restaurants near the parking structure, including a Haagen Dazs shop. The more expensive restaurants are in the hotel itself. The fountain by the elevators is beautiful. At night, there's a security guard by the elevators who may ask to see your room key, which makes me feel more secure.",0,0,0

I was only staying for two nights so I didn't throw a fit about them over booking my room however the room they gave me was terrible. The carpet was filthy and it was right next to an air conditioning unit. I called the front desk and asked if they could move me or if they could at least give me a better room since they were the ones who over booked my suite. I was told they couldn't do anything. At this point I was upset because not only did I lose my suite but I was in a noisy dirty room. Again, I tried not to let it bug me because I was only staying for two nights, however it was extremely disappointing. The room service was great though and so was the food. I am not sure I'd stay here again after the terrible service I received and over booking my suite.

I also wished the bathroom counters weren't so terribly small.

The hotel casino itself had all the amenities you can expect from a big LV hotel.  Plenty of restaurants of all price ranges, nice pool, and plenty of bars to enjoy your nights.  We went to see Ka while there, and being hotel guests we got a substantial discount on our show tickets.

First,    everything you could want in a destination location is found in the MGM. 
The hotel boasts great places to eat, a supurb pool, large poker room, huge casino ( maybe even a bit to huge ) and excellent entertainment. The Ka experience is totally amazing as are the night club experiences beginning with Studio 54.

Second,    the location of the hotel and casino on the corner of Tropicana gives tyou access to all the hotels at this end of the strip. The variety of activities around this corner intersection with the NYNY is just amazing.

Finally ...... The rooms are very nice and there is a variety of styles that should please everyone.
I enjoy the standard tower room, but got upgraded through a super front desk clerk to a west wing room on one weekend visit. 
West wing rooms are smaller than the tower room, but the decor is very modern and the cozyness of the room with all the ambiance makes for  an outstanding weekend experience.
I stayed in the Hollywood suites with the family and found them to be nice, but nothing special other than the size and the fact that you have your own seperate entrance to the hotel area. The suites are located opposite the grand tower elevators.

I think the MGM grand is exemplified by the grandeaur of the lobby area. It truely is amazing in size and scope.
I have always found the desk people to be super nice and willing to meet all your needs.

In all aspects of casino action, quality dining experiences, late evening entertainment, quality spa and swimming pool and spectacular shows you can not do better in one location in Las Vegas.

In all ways the MGM is ............ grand.",0,1,1

One of the top two worst Vegas hotel experiences.

I'm here right now on a vacay. 
Last year I came for the same event, stayed at the Palms for the same price and the room was a sweet, suite and around THREE times as big!!! 

I was so upset, so I called for a room upgrade.  
Upgrade fee .. okay. I leave my room on the 8th floor and to my new room which I have to go down to 1st and up another elevator to the 16th floor.

I enter....

TV on some random channel...
Closet open with lights on...
Seats moved around...
One of the bathroom lights on...

There is an empty pizza box... 
couple empty beers...
iron and board set up...
messy sheets... 
spot lamp lighting pointing at the bed.... 

and a f ing open ""LOVE BOX""....
MULTIPLE USED CONDOMS and their open wrappers littering the room

... uh... 

I call pissed and request another room and to waive the fee... nope. 

You kidding me?! Apparently there are no similar rooms available on the floor or any near floors which use the same elevator so we have to go back down and up again and return to the 8th floor. 

I enter the new room upset and unsatisfied by the choice I made for which resort to stay in.
Oh and now the remote doesn't work in the new suite. Now I'm watching a continuous commercial looping and telling me how MGM is supposed to make my stay great.

We rest for 30 minutes and head over to the Ling Ling Lounge in Hakkasan which was reserved for our own private party.
After everyone waited for 40 minutes PAST our reserved time they THEN mention the ""dress code"" issue which was never previously mentioned, or expected due to the lounge being reserved and private party.
We return back to our rooms to change and return to the event.

For starters: when I called to book the hotel I asked about joining rooms because I was bringing 2 children with me to visit family who were in town visiting Vegas. The lady on the phone said she could not reserve two rooms next to each other but that it shouldn't be an issue when we arrived to request it. 

When we did arrive the lady that was helping us asked if we had ""blocked"" rooms next to each other- I had explained that I called and requested it, but the lady on the phone said she couldn't do it. The lady helping check us in said that was not true, she could have helped us. 

So we didn't get a room next to family which was really important for the children for when they were sleeping to be right next door in the next room. So that sucked! Secondly, our room was filled with smoke from cigarettes and weed! It was so heavy that I called around 4\/5am and told the front desk. They said they could bring an air purifier and help with the smoke. I thought that was at least something since my kids are breathing it in. THEN I received a call from the person delivering the air purifier and he said they would need to come back and pick it up after 30min.... which would mean we would need to be up again to give it back and so they wouldn't wake the kids after not sleeping alllll night.

OTHER LITTLE THINGS:
1. The remote didn't work
2. I took cans of beer out of the fridge to put Breast milk and they charged us and my husband had to spend our post dinner time explaining what happened because we didn't know that you can't even take anything out because it's censored...

1. The act of reserving; a keeping back or withholding.
     a. An arrangement by which accommodations are secured in advance, as in a hotel or on an airplane.
     b. The accommodations so secured.
     c. The record or promise of such an arrangement.

I don't know about you, but for me the entire point of a reservation is to ensure that you get what you want when you expect to get it.  To further secure such a reservation, PAYING IN ADVANCE should by all known laws of commerce guarantee that you receive the service or item in question.  Apparently at the MGM, that only applies if you are a celebrity and\/or ""make it rain"" on everyone with a gold name tag.  

I reserved and pre-paid for my suite two whole months before my stay.  But alas, upon check-in they were somehow out of suites.  Could it have been the highrollers in town for the boxing title bout that weekend at the MGM?  The hotel's only solution was to give me a regular ""Deluxe"" room and some free buffet vouchers.  I didn't want to make a scene and start my mini-vacation off with a bad vibe so the wife and I reluctantly decided to at least check out the Deluxe room offered.  The room sucked.  Plain and simple.  I had a lovely view of rooftop air conditioning units and wonderful green alien-esque MGM trademark spotlights aimed right at my window.  The room was less than half the size of the suite I paid for, and there was a broken lamp and water damage stains on the ceiling (at least I hope it was water).  Further investigation also showed that the food vouchers they gave us didn't make up for the price difference in the downgraded room. 

I called the manager to complain.  She was less than apologetic and actually acted like she was doing me the favor by comping the buffet.  After 3 rounds of increasingly angry calls, my wife was finally able to get them to magically make the suite we paid for appear on the second night of our stay and upgraded the buffet credits to full resort credits which we were able to use at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant.

Customer service is key, especially when you have such strong competition, so needless to say I will never stay at the MGM again.  I didn't roll up in a green and gold Lambo, but I expect to be treated with respect and fairness.",8,3,2

I must say the biggest plus of the Stay Well experience is the separate registration area which is located between the massive general registration area and the bell desk. There must have been 200 people in line for general registration when I arrived, so this was worth every penny to check-in behind a closed door away from the masses. Upon entering the Stay Well Registration area, I was greeted warmly and offered a bottle of tasty blackberry infused bottled water. It was a nice start. Little touches can add a lot to the experience. As for the room, pretty much a standard room with some bonus items such as: an air purifier, a scent machine which made the room smell like green tea (fresh and clean), an outrageously comfortable bed, vitamin C infused shower water (reminded of non-vitamin C infused shower water), a night time clock designed to put you gently to sleep (zero patience to figure out how to work this device), wellness lighting in the bathroom which appeared to be nothing more than settings of really bright and not as bright,  and some other stuff that has already been forgotten. I enjoyed the Stay Well experience, but primarily for the ease of check-in.

As for the rest, I always enjoy the MGM. It smells fantastic throughout, a combination of jasmine and rose, I've read. The pools are comfortable and spacious.

This experience was less than comfortable and the amenities aren't close to what they once were in my opinion.

I stayed here two nights in the west tower during a business trip so the entertainment, casino and restaurants was not the attraction it was about comfort, location and proximity to the airport. Apparently this was my first time parking a rental car in their garage and it may be my last, the walk from the garage to the west tower rooms had got to be approaching a mile once you consider the route. I certainly understand the business model and by design they make sure you pass by every shop, restaurant in the hotel and finally you must wind through the casino with your luggage in hand to get to the most ridiculous elevator location one can imagine it's located at the furtherest point from the main lobby (from the car to the room was no less than a twenty minute walk carrying luggage).

West Tower Room 3-503 very simple room - semi private bathroom, no counter space so plan on leaving all all your toiletries in your luggage, the lavatory sink was a miniature with very slow drainage, a small glass desk, surprisingly comfortable bed and two chairs.

My issues - NO HOT WATER -  it doesn't matter how early you wake up and turn the shower on the water will barely get lukewarm the same issue for the lavatory so expect a cold shave ugh! I don't want to hear did I contact the front desk the walk wouldn't be worth the trouble and there is nothing the maintenance department can do by coming up to the room this is a infrastructure issue that they know about it and further makes my point about this aging giant. Changing rooms you say - well we had multiple rooms and all had similar issues.

The lighting is good for sleeping not for reading, working or using the mirror above the lavatory.

The electrical outlets be warned your apple charger for your iPhone or IPad will fall out the socket. 

Check in process - Although there are an ample number of stations for the hotel representatives to check in customers only 25% of them were being used we arrived late evening it still required about a 20 minute waiting in a slow moving line even though we had advance reservations, of course it's the up selling and marketing that's a priority here no regard for the customer needs apparently. 

It pains me to write these kind of reviews especially for a place that once was so on top of their game. I will really have to consider other options in the future.",19,6,5

And to be honest it was for the most part amazing with heaps of activities for the holidays and the kids to enjoy. What I found ridiculous was the lack of ability to deal with families traveling with children. I have five rooms this stay and checking out tomorrow after a 4 night stay. Everyday since we arrived in some way or form we were addressed rudely by staff because we had kids. Even when just in strollers while trying to buy 10 tickets to KA at the M-Life Players club. I'm not upset about the rules at all but the delivery of their message and attitude of majority of the staff we came across during our stay. I have stayed at the Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, BlueGreen and Pallazo and they have all been amazing with us and our kids.  And we will return to these places instead of returning here.  We ran into three other families traveling with children and I was not surprised at all that they were having the same reaction to staying at the MGM. As a Gold MLife member I will not be bringing my family here again nor will I be returning on my own.

The price and size of the rooms are definitely not worth it, but you really can't beat the location, and the room was clean and every employee we dealt with during our stay was super sweet.  We paid for two queen beds in a room for two nights: Friday-Sunday morning.  The room was TINY- we could barely have people over in our room (there were 8 in our party, spread out over Vegas), which surprised me as I would think two queen beds would include some actual living space.  Or a coffee maker.  Or a fridge.  I would trade our TV for either item in a heartbeat.  Apparently, in Vegas, a coffee maker is worth it's weight in gold, or whatever MGM charges you to rent one for your room!

That being said, the MGM is right on the strip, close to the airport, and contains what I think is the best club and the best buffet in Vegas.  There's something to be said for being able to return to your room in a drunken stupor 10min after leaving the club.  I was also surprised by how quiet the hotel was, for  being in Vegas during the weekend.  We only heard one noise complaint, something about someone barrel-racing through the hallways... I'm just said I missed that one.  I have mixed feelings about recommending the MGM to anyone else looking for a room in Vegas, but if you have money to spend, it is clean and convenient!",4,2,1

The room was nice and clean and reasonably priced.
The casino is huge and beautiful. A lot of good places to eat and drink. The pools are great especially the lazy river.
There is a monorail stop right behind so that is very convenient since its at the end of the strip. You can get a 3 day unlimited pass for, I think, $28. So worth it to save on some of the walking.

I work out of the gym, we frequent the spa and get spa services, we see shows, and we gamble at the casino. We contribute to keeping this place alive. We have stayed at the MGM signature, also Mandalay Bay, and others of MGM's affiliates. The thing that I will say is that it's not the cleanest hotel, because it is so much older than the others.

When a trip to Vegas became a reality, I remembered about this email and went back to look at it because I remembered the expire date was mid august and there were no block out dates for the month that I had planned for. But when I opened the email, the photos were all broken, but they still had the words there that linked to the offer.

Turns out, they took all the photos down, changed the offer to just 70$ credit total and made it expire sooner. So I called MGM and after 30 minutes on the phone they said no such offer existed. I thought maybe I was wrong and made a mistake, BUT I went searching for another code and found proof that I was correct about the deal, because retailmenot had posted it as well.

Ok, since my last review, i have stayed at this hotel 9 times. I end up in Vegas a lot for both work and fun. I want to make something clear to people booking this hotel. When you make a reservation, specifically for a suite, you are not guarranteed the room type you booked. And if you booked a suite on a busy weekend, forget about getting that room unless you are some fancy high roller! Labor day weekend i was supposed to have an executive suite room with 2 queen beds and a connecting grand king room. Plenty of room for 5 people! Instead, i ended up with a regular room with 2 queen beds. Yes, that is right, 1 room only! The hotel also doesn't use ""rollaway"" beds anymore.  Upon checkin when i found out about all this, it was too late to book at another hotel. Also, the front desk staff checking me in was rude about it. The front desk woman,( who's name i referenced in a letter to the executive office this week) told me that it wasn't her problem that i had 5 people to fit into 2 queen size beds. 

I like everything about this hotel except for that policy. I would love to have a catered event over the holidays in one of their suites, but i'm afraid that if i plan something, then go to check in, i won't get the room i requested.(Why wouldn't i be hesitant? The last 5 stays i haven't received the room type that i requested.) I have expressed my concerns many times, sent emails to executive offices, talked to Mlife representatives, etc. No one ever calls me back.


Summary: You aren't guarranteed your specific room that you booked. It doesn't matter when you booked it. The early check in fee doesn't guarrantee that you will get your specific room either! The hotel overbooks all of the rooms and suites. It is first come, first serve, checkin for the rooms. Unless of course you are a high roller, then you get whatever you want. ( I'm just a gold mlife member that is supposed to get complimentary room upgrades-what a joke-never happens!)

The quality of the West Wing (5 star) far exceeds the Grand (3 star), which is understandable as the West Wing has been recently remodeled, but there was a big gap in the cleanliness of the rooms. My room at the West Wing was immaculate, but there was a lack of attention to detail during my stay in the Grand suites. There was long and short hairs sticking  to the ceiling of the bathroom, there was a band aid sticking to the bed headboard, and there was a large red stain that hadn't quite washed out of the sheets.

I have stayed here three times (twice against my wishes ... work trips) and it seems to get worse every time I visit.  On one occasion the non-smoking room reeked as if a gang of chain-smoking gypsies had lived in that room a month.

I absolutely HATE that they make you walk through their mall from the parking to the hotel \/ casino (I don't go to timeshare presentations, why should they force me to ""timeshare"" and walk past those lame magnet stores, the bluescreen photo studio, and other various substandard and uninteresting retail outlets).  I know it's marketing, but the mall is just sad.  I hate that Aladdin makes me do the same thing, but at least the stores there are fresh and worthy of perusing.  I felt like I was in one of those old Flintstones cartoons where the same building \/ tree goes by in the background a dozen times while Fred chases Barney ... ""Didn't I just see a magnet store?""  But I digress ...

The eateries are all fine ... nothing stupendous (but I never ate at any of the ""upper scale"" ones as I'd rather just go over to Bellagio or Mandalay Bay to spend my money).  I do remember one bar having bottles of Chimay which was nice.  They also do have a Davidoff cigar store which was a pleasant surprise.  The casino seemed acceptable ... but sprawling.  I stopped gambling when I go to Vegas, but it seemed fairly well layed out, but not as cozy or friendly as others.   The MGM Grand is also the end of the line for the Las Vegas monorail which is an added benefit if you happen to stay here (but plan on walking through that annoying mall to get to the station).

Generally, the atmosphere is lackluster.  Also, everytime I've been there over the span of a few years, it's the only casino that has had portions under construction in the casino area.  I've stayed at over a dozen of on and off-the strip hotels and this is almost at the bottom (the Motel 6 is lower, by the way) in terms of overall experience.

I was extremely pleased with this hotel. It was well designed to entertain you while you wait in the long lines to check in, and there are lots of elevators that only serve about 7 or so floors each so you can get to your room quickly. Once on your floor the wagon wheel design means that you don't have to walk a hundred miles and this design makes it very easy for you get where you need to down at the casino level.

There was a good food court and easy access to the monorail which makes it easy to avoid renting a car or catching a cab to get around town - this is a huge value which can't be understated.

We ate at Shibuya which was fantastic! Sure it was very expensive, but the quality matched the price (for Vegas) and the environment was WOW. Price was about $450 for 5 people, so bring a fat wallet.

We saw Ka and really enjoyed it -  no complaints other than it was more than we paid for O which I thought was a better show. There also was a segment that was all video instead of people due to the accidental death of a member last year, so that was rather disappointing. Honestly I think they would have been better off just skipping that part rather than showing a video as I wouldn't have known I missed it and wouldn't have felt short changed. I understand why it wasn't real people and agree with their decision, but I'd say just fill the time doing something else less risky with real people and that would have been just as good. I think we paid about $350 for two people plus fees, but we had front and center seats on row P (which is is as close as I'd want to be for this show - don't get much closer)

The rooms were very modern, super clean (way better than Bellagio and as good as Four Seasons). Loved the room and the well thought out bathroom. There's also very convenient access to charge your gadgets so I'd call this the best hotel room I've enjoyed in Vegas.

We stayed on the 25th floor which had the downside of being behind the David Copperfield sign which meant there was this screen pattern which made it hard to enjoy the strip view that we paid extra for. Definitely ask to NOT be on these floors when you check in and all will be well. 

The food court was good and the Casino was excellent. Cigar smokers will enjoy the Davidoff store as well.

Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel and I'd call it my favorite place I've stayed in Vegas.

I called the technicians and after waiting 20 minutes, I called the front desk explaining them the problem and that I am in a hurry since I have a dinner appointment. The lady just says hold on a moment and transfers me back to the technician department. That's really great service.

I decided to book a room in this West Wing of the hotel during this visit. The West Wing rooms are located closer to the front entrance near the Rainforest Cafe. This afforded us to have closer access to the Strip and so not to have to walk all the way through the Casino. The rooms were smaller, but were not recently renovated as the rooms at the Grand Tower. I selected this hotel only because of the Backlot Lazy River and the other pools in which we had an excellent time!

The elevators leading to the West Wing rooms where very dirty, beaten up and looked like elevators which had graffiti and were from the 'ghetto'. The elevators were working, but so bad that you could not tell which floor you were at. The West Wing lounge, carpet & entrance area looked 'cheap & filthy'! The front desk personnel did not inform us until we inquired that we can reach our room via the elevators close to the Front Desk and near the Grand Tower so we didn't have to walk to & from the Casino to reach our rooms in the West Wing. The resort fee we were charged included a $15 Bar Credit which we could not use in the Pool area and most of the inside Bars did not have a blender for 'frozen' type of drinks. Also, we could not bring our own floatation to use in the Backlot Lazy River and had to purchase use the Tubes which cost $16 each.

Stayed here over the weekend in a Grand Tower Suite.

We had a king bed that was not as soft as I thought it should be. But the the pillows and blankets were really nice. 

Nice flat screen TV, glass desk, couch, coffee table and mirrored walls.

It was lame that they only have a mini fridge filled with drinks you have to buy and no room for our personal drinks.

Our view was pretty nice, but most of it was the roof of the parking structure below.

My favorite thing about the room is probably the bathroom because it was very modern, clean, and bright. They had many towels of all sizes and was enough for at least four people. 

Although the hot water was always too hot or not hot enough. I had difficulty getting it to the right temperature. The shower curtains were two layers of cloth, which I would of preferred one layer to be plastic so that water does not get out.

I would highly recommend parking your car with valet because it's a lot shorter walk. There was a point where Valet was full so we ha to park our car in the parking structure and it was sooooo far away and you have to walk through tunnels, elevators, and stairs just to get back.

The check in\/check out lobby also has pineapple fused water and watermelon fused water if you have trouble finding or buying expensive water!

Our hotel room even looks as neat when we leave as when we check in. That is, in most respects we are the antithesis of the Vegas strip target audience. So how do we have fun here? With ease.

MGM Grand, like many of the big Vegas hotel\/casino properties, is a city unto itself: shopping, restaurants, and even clean entertainment are easily found. There are two distinct experiences and I love them both. In the afternoon and evenings there is an electric feeling, excitement all around with over-the-top visual and aural saturation. But I also enjoy breakfast and the quiet walks around the MGM city in the mornings when everyone is still crashed after a late night of entertainment.

All the times we've stayed at MGM Grand, we've never been disappointed in the room or service. Even the regular rooms are nicely appointed and the higher end rooms are luxurious to normal people (not that I'm accused very often of being normal).
 
If you qualify with your reservation, get a VIP pass and go to the front of the line at the buffet-- the humongous buffet that offers seemingly miles of excellent food selections.

One evening after a thoroughly enjoyable family experience at KÀ (we love the Cirque du Soleil shows), we dropped in at the Studio Café restaurant for a 1:00am light dinner. There I had my first experience with lettuce wraps. Loved them. I've made it a point since to order them when we go to a restaurant where they are available. My wife and I were very impressed with the restaurant staff, always very friendly and helpful. Where do they get all that energy at 1:00am?

A family favorite is The Lion Habitat. We especially enjoy it at feeding time when the animal handler walks around inside the habitat throwing raw meat onto the glass walls right in front of the children. The lions leap up and attack the meat to the nervous delight of the children who stand a few inches away with just an invisible barrier between them and the lion.

Our 800 square foot room was furnished modernly with a muted color palette and lots of dark wood. What made this girl super giggly was the bathroom! His and hers sinks, a whole wall of mirrors, a bathtub that would easily support a 8 person orgy, a sit down shower, and his and hers bathrobes and slippers (or hers and hers, his and his, etc. whatever your flavor).

 I love the poker room here, the casino is always packed with party people and drunks 24\/7 and there's always something going on. It's connected to a few other hotels and it really isn't to far to get to like 5 other casinos. 

 On fight nights this place is absolutely bananas and the sports book goes off the hook as well . 

 Did I mention this is ground zero for the high end hookers as well? EVERY night from around 10pm to 4am there are whore walking through this place. TONS of em. HOT ones. GUARANTEED every night they flock to this place like buzzards to a carcass.

 If you have a room here getting some entertainment up to that room is as easy as having a bankroll and being able to talk. That's it. 

 Bottom line is there are more whore hanging out here than any other casino. You might find cheaper rates from some breezies hanging out at Gold Coast or Palace Station but if your looking for a 10, look no further.",1,1,1

We brought our family with us this time, my parents, and my grandmother whom we flew in from Mexico. I noticed there was tons of hookers siting at the slot machines right by the elevator (super obvious).  The hotel brooms smelled musty which should have been our first clue something was wrong. After the first night my wife and I started feeling itchy and noticing little red bumps all over our bodies especially on our legs. My parents and grandmother who was staying across the hallway in another room complained of the same thing. After the second night it got worse and  and the rashes spread, a quick lift of the mattress revealed yellow stains and hair all over the place, it looked like it never been cleaned in years.   

We notified the hotel management and they switched us to different rooms.  They had us fill out report and then sent security up to take pictures of the bumps and rashes on our bodies.  We were told they would follow up with us in a few days but they never did. This absolutely ruined our vacation and we are grossed out the rest of the time we were there.  I called the hotel and spoke to someone that deals with these cases, a woman I didn't catch her name, she was extremely rude and condescending, almost 2 weeks after leaving we still had the bumps and I had to go to my doctor who told me I was definitely bit by bed bugs. The woman I spoke to denied the claim made by my doctor and said there was nothing she was going to do for us.

I chopped up my mlife card, I'll never set foot in another MGM resort, I should have stuck to the Palazzo like we ussually do.",6,1,0

There are a lot of food options (Highly recommend Pieology) There are two showers so it's convenient when you have a group of 4+ people. THE CRAB LEG BUFFET IS AMAZING. Worth every penny. The beds are amazing and the tower rooms are incredibly spacious. 

Cons: Do not he fooled. MGM does not book the rooms that you select and are expecting when you book. Your rooms are actually picked out when you check in. That is why so many people who expect to be next to each other are duped when they end up being seperated. The smoke isn't ""horrible"" but if you hate smoke like me....it can be quite nauseating going through the lobby. Just be prepared. It sketched me out that there were not any locks on the doors. One of our girls was mistakenly charge $1600 for the room on her card when the hold fee was only supposed to be $400. If you raise enough hell for poor customer service they will take care of you. We got our rooms upgraded and she got 3 free buffets. Do NOT take no for an answer, people. It is Vegas and Vegas will try to seperate tourists from their money if you let them. Be smart and assertive.

Tips: If you acknowledge the staff with kindness and sobrierty you get MUCH farther with your requests. I was with a group of 6 and was the only sober one so when we needed something I would do the talking. The non-sober people were literally overlooked and ignored.",0,0,0

This last trip was more than a little disappointing, however.  The check-in\/check-out process took a combined 45 mins, which is just ridiculous.  Instead of having one line that feeds the several clerks (like every other business on earth), at the MGM you literally gamble and pick a line that you think will go fast.  30 tellers, 30 lines.  Stupid.  Inevitably someone who just showed up will get in line next to you and be done before you're even started.  Very frustrating.

MGM was also hosting the fight so it was a busy weekend! We arrived Friday night around 11 pm and valet was still open. I've stayed at other hotels on the strip with a late arrival and valet was closed. So kudos to you MGM.

Check in was pretty easy considering all that was going on. I think we waited a total of like 30 minutes roughly. Our bellhop was extremely nice and asked if we needed anything else after he brought our luggage to us. We actually only left the hotel itself once because we enjoyed it so much.

The hotel offers wifi, but don't get too excited the service was horrible whether I was on wifi or using my own data. Don't plan on sending too many text messages or using social media while there, lol.

We decided to eat by the pool. It was a nice view, but a little hot. The menu didn't have a wide selection of food. In my opinion it was pretty limited. I had just a burger and fries it was about $17. The burger was pretty good and the portion was large. 

We spent Saturday at the lazy river and that was tons of fun. A lot of people, but everyone was super friendly and there to have a good time. They have different drink options you can pretty much get anything you want in what I call a to go cup. They cost about $26 with your drink of choice and refills are $17. Also jello shots are $3 which is even better.

We had a great view of New York New York and Excalibur.  One thing I did not know is that rooms do not have a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerator.  No coffee maker means that you are stuck buying over-priced coffee from Starbucks (but everything is expensive in Vegas).  The daily refrigerator fee is $25... so it's cheaper to buy food than to keep leftovers.  There is a large convenience store near the west entrance and this can save you A LOT of money on snacks and beer (beer cans are 2 for $3).  The room rate is reasonable compared to other hotels, although we did not know that there is an additional $30 ""resort"" fee plus tax.  However, I think every hotel has this additional fee per night.  I personally liked this area of the Strip more because it was closer to the airport and was much less dense with people.  MGM also has a monorail station.  I recommend getting a 3-day monorail pass and planning accordingly.

The layout of the hotel is a bit annoying though.  We were there for a week and still had trouble finding our way around the casino.  It can be a SLOW walk to go through the casino from the elevators to the west entrance, and the bars and restaurants are at the opposite end.  I guess that's the point though.

Really enjoyed staying at MGM! Went with the boyfriend during the week.. got a great deal on Expedia--only $5 more per night for the Grand King over the Petite King... definitely get the Grand King room if you get a similar deal.. totally worth it. 

Pros:
- Push a button on the wall and blackout shades come down over the window. Amazing. Felt like a rich person for sure. And made sleeping in 293472398 times better. 
- Very spacious room, really comfortable bed
- Updated and chic decor
- Gorgeous bathroom, huge mirror that lit up, spacious shower\/tub
- Nice big flat screen with plenty of channels
- Although the hallway seemed noisy, couldn't hear any noise from inside our room
- Easiest check out ever!!  Go down to the lobby, fill out a card with your name and room number, drop it in a box, and you're done. I hear they have an app you can download so you can check out on your phone as well. No waiting in lines!

Cons:
- Had to do A LOT of walking...took a long time to get from the parking garage to the lobby, then to get to the room, and once you get in the casino it seems like it takes forever to get anywhere. The place is HUGE. 
- Even though it was a Wednesday, had to wait a little while at check in.

Seriously, the MGM is past its prime and offers no ""signature attraction"".  The ""Crazy Horse"" Revue is a waste of money, and if you have epilepsy, the light changes could send you into a seizure!  

The Lion Habitat is more saddening than interesting.  The lions appear sedated--but then, so do most of the people looking at them.  

The rooms have seen better days, and if you have a Corner Suite (located at the ends of the halls), the walk from the elevator to the Suite is 10-12 minutes!  That's a long walk if you're hammered!

THE BAD: 
This place is FREEZING inside. So cold can't believe it. I was playing blackjack and started shaking from the heat exposure outside and alcohol I had to go up to my room and turn on the heater. My husband was freezing too so it's not just me.

Our room was very outdated. The bedside tables were worn down and peeling from water damage. The carpet was ehhhh and the TV was small. Nice view though...If I ever come back I am going to stay in the West wing or one of their newer suites. 

Unfortunately Las Vegas cleans out their sewer system once a month and makes the whole town smell like ass. We were here on a Monday night when they did this and it made you feel like you were breathing, bathing and ingesting..CACA!!! On the 19th floor!!! Since it was 3AM when I got in on our last night, I didn't have the sobriety or energy to move rooms. My husband called up and they at least comped the room that night and a few other things.

Our friends went to the Cirque du Soleil show there and did not like it very much.

THE GOOD:
First they were very nice about our smelly experience which is why they have 3 stars.

The food was good. I wish I could remember what restaurants we went to but I did enjoy it. 

The pool is FUN! Lots of people watching, lots of super hot people and everyone loved the river running around it. Good service from pool personnel.

Even though the room was outdated the bed was very comfortable. My husband loved the very large body pillow and we slept like babies. 

I don't like the idea of Lions in captivity but I did enjoy seeing them. They are so beautiful I wish I could go in there... :)

I enjoy trying a new hotel to get a new experience from the strip. So, I read other reviews and gave the West Wing a try. Good news is the elevators were near a side exit to the strip.  The next building over is the Grand Canyon Experience where you can buy water 2 for $1 which is great, since there is no water in your room (or coffee).  Sadly, the resort fee doesn't give you much. Recently I stayed at the Monte Carlo, the resort fee there covered 2 bottles of water and coffee...daily.

Now, good luck finding the elevator. If you are coming from the casino, the elevators are hidden.  First option, walk to the back of the West Wing bar and look around the corner. When it seems like you found the employee entrance, turn another corner and there it is. Weird! Second option, follow the signs around the high roller area and just past the spa. Keep walking down the narrow and long hallway. The hall has a correctional facility feel to it. Dark gray walls with low forboding ceilings. Oh by the way, that hallway is the first floor of the West Wing. Should you stay here, refuse a room on this floor. Every time we were coming or going, crazy loud drunks abound...I mean falling into the walls and barely making it up the hallway drunk. Most of them seem to be coming from the beach area.  Frat house loud drunks.  

Luckily, our room was on the 12th floor across from housekeeping and the elevators which is nice until about 5:30 am.....when the garbage trucks come in.  Daily!  I get the feeling this wing should have been a parking garage.",6,2,1

The arena is a great place for concerts; not a bad seat in the house. My initial impression of the hotel was that it was too big for my taste as I usually like smaller, boutique hotels. But I decided to stay there after having been to concert at the area earlier in the year and the convenience factor weighed heavily on my decision this time. Glad it did ! I was pleasantly surprised! The room, although small, was beautiful and utilized the space in an amazingly efficient way, making it very comfortable; contemporary and tasteful. Quiet. The pillow top bed, down comforter and down pillows made sleeping heavenly. The rates were very reasonable; look for their ""specials""...well worth it. Large flat screen TV and nice big closet with a safe...the use of lots of mirrors made the room seem bigger than it was and well lit. There was even a small TV screen (what looked like a black 6 x 6 square as part of the mirror) that was awesome! I wondered what that tiny remote was for on the bathroom vanity shelf! How clever! The shower was huge and the fixtures beautifully contemporary and worked well; hot, hot, hot water! Perfect! The room was very clean (although the carpet did show some wear). Overall service by hotel employees was excellent. As for food, there were choices for everyone at every price (check out the food court if you are traveling with kids for lots of choices at reasonable prices). You didn't have to leave the hotel if you didn't want to. Everything was right there and the casino was lots of fun; even won a few bucks at the slots; very active and lots of people were winning. The airport shuttle was only $7, a bargain if you have ever taken a cab for the first time and got hit for $18 for the 5 minute trip! I loved the MGM Grand and will return again.  Great experience overall and highly recommend. MLife card for comps is great and can be used at other hotels in Vegas. Get one as soon as you arrive and start using it. Things add up fast.",0,0,0

It was my first time to Vegas and this hotel was okay. It being a larger scale hotel, you feel a bit overlooked at both check-in and check-out and not to valued. We did have a nice room on a top floor with a great view of the strip. One night i asked for turn down service, and that never came. One day we asked for our room to be cleaned around 12pm, and it was cleaned at 6pm. When i called to ask to be upgraded to a suite, i was told it was not available (however the suite was viewable on there website). I paid for a resort fee, but was not able to utilize any of the perks of that because the pool\/gym were closed, no newspaper was delivered, and horrible WiFi. We self parked as well.

The room size was fine, not spacious but not cramped. Everything was old and dated, the bathroom mirror was literally falling off the wall and the wiring in the wall was perfectly visible. Also there was a light literally protruding from the middle of the mirror right at eye level. Weird and very inconvenient, had to move from one side to the other while putting my makeup on because the lighting was so off. The hall carpet was worn and dirty, as was the wallpaper. Inquired about late check out when we checked and was told to just call the front desk same day. Well we called just before going to sleep around 3 and they said they couldn't let us check out late. I work the night shift and was trying to stay on schedule and this just totally wrecked it.

New casinos & hotels have sprouted up like multi-colored weeds up & down the strip, but many of the old pillars are still around.  Even the MGM lion has changed!  Lots of new celebrity chef restaurants have opened in MGM as well as many new shops.  The lobby check-in area is the same ol' same ol', as crowded and slow as it once was, but we got through it.  They did have peach & watermelon water right by the line though, which was a nice touch.

I had us upgraded to an Executive room in the Grand Tower and it was a pretty big space with a large sitting area and 2 queen beds.  Nice!  The bathroom even had separate shower and tub\/shower and 2 sinks which allowed us to get ready in the morning a lot faster.  We were on a low floor (4th) and didn't have a view of the strip, but we'll live.

We were on the same floor as the Cardio room, which was a bonus to stroll down the hall for workouts.  It was all treadmills, ellipticals & steppers; no weight machines and had a great view of Tropicana Ave.  It was exercise in itself if you were at the end of one of the mile long hallways just walking to the elevator!  I pitied the people I saw that had end rooms after a night of partying and drinking to find their room down one of these halls.  Good luck with that!  The walk to the parking garage is also pretty long, but at least it's air conditioned walking through the underground connecting tunnel with all its shops.

As a bonus for booking our stay, we got discounted tickets to KA, which was a great show! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/k%C3%A0-by-cirque-du-soleil-las-vegas-2?hrid=7GDHljpDpD4DP36IJ3r8iA#src:self

-electrical outlets sucked, some won't work and some other were all loose, things would not stay plugged!!!

-TV was pretty old...and by old...I mean OLLLLD!

-Main lamp in the room was not even plugged....

-What?! No coffee maker!??!?! WTH! even at Motel 6 they have one!

-Shower head....terrible..simply terrible...hey MGM!..Costco has really nice ones for 30 dlls!

-No fan in the bathroom?...ugh...

-One of the pictures of the wall was missing and the other one had a really messed up frame and no glass??!?!

This was the third trip to Vegas and second time on the strip, my first stay was at Circus Circus, which I considered decent (outstanding for the vacation price Southwest gave me) but this time I wanted to try something nicer.  Everything was very nice, I checked in around 7 pm so the line was short, very friendly staff and I'm including everyone that I dealt with not just the front desk employees.  For me, finding my room on the 9th floor of the West Wing was difficult and I'm not above using my map or asking for help.  I must have looked like I knew where I was going because four or five other people asked me for directions, so I would guess this isn't an uncommon complaint.  I really liked the fact that you could get to the gym easily, the elevator marked it on the 4th floor but I wasn't able to check it out due to forgetting my teeshirt and I didn't want to spend 30 bucks on a shirt at the gift shop just to sweat in it.  I tried out the buffet, always an awkward experience when eating alone but I couldn't decide on which restaurant in the hotel I wanted to eat at and I regretted the decision. The food was decent and at (what I assume is) the correct warm\/cold temp, good price so I'm not complaining but last time I had lunch at the Luxor and I feel like it was much better food and selection.    My main complaint is the hotel fee of 24.95, I understand it's for internet and other services and that ALL the other hotels charge a price as well (this is the most expensive one so far) but then I feel that the internet service should be up to par.  In my room, I got two bars it was slow enough that I ended up just using my hotspot from my phone, that's right my 3G connection to my tablet was faster than the 24.95 I paid for, basically, internet at the hotel.  The next morning I figured I would just go to the Starbucks to use the WiFi there and yet again, no service.  This time I was able to pick up on another hotels connection and it was stronger than the hotel's that I was actually staying\/sitting at. Problem, oh heck yes. 

Pros:
Clean hotel
Friendly staff
Easy check in
Won 40 bucks in penny slots (lost same 40 bucks at gift shop)
On the Strip
By Monorail (I didn't use it though)
Large food\/activity selection

Cons:
The creepy long mirrored hallways, really am I the only one creeped out by those?
horrid internet service
Hard to find anything at the hotel, I'm pretty sure I missed about 75% of the whole place.



The main question, would I stay here again? Answer In the future yes, if the price was right I would, I don't have that many complaints about it but I am planning my next trip to Vegas and I am certainly finding a different hotel for this next stay.",3,1,0

I booked the hotel months in advance due to the fantastic rates they were offering. I originally booked for 7\/8- 7\/11. I then decided to take the family to the KA show on 7\/7 and booked a separate reservation for the night of 7\/7.  I had to do this because they didn't have our preferred room available on 7\/7 so we couldn't just change the check in date. 

I started to get nervous before the trip as the UFC event was scheduled to be held on 7\/7 after I'd already booked and I was concerned about over booking, crowds, etc. We decided to just go ahead and give it a shot.

Check in took FOREVER on 7\/7, but I wasn't terribly put off due to knowing the UFC event was that evening. Our room was immediately available and our bags were delivered promptly. The renovated queen room looked alright, but was very small. The bathroom was dirty, there was hair everywhere, and the shower had a moldy, musty smell. It didn't look like a renovated bath to me, but maybe I'm being picky.

KA was absolutely fantastic and worth the exorbitant price! No complaints there. We ate at the Grand Wok afterwards and the food was beyond delicious. The service was really slow, but again the hotel appeared to be at capacity with the special event. I didn't take exception to the long wait for food. The staff was really nice.

The next day is when the problems began. I went down to check into our new room, which should've been an executive suite. The lady at the desk, Bri, was very nice but explained there were no executive suites available. I asked if there were any other suites available, even if I had to pay the difference. She informed me that a Marquee suite was available and I agreed to the upgrade, which was more than triple the rate I would've paid. It was worth it to me in order to transition to the new room before having to pick up family from the airport and take them to their hotel. I trekked up to the new room and lo and behold there are people already in the room. WTF?! The gentleman was very nice, but stated they weren't leaving until that afternoon and hadn't checked out so he didn't know why they reassigned the room, and that their experience\/room situation was all screwed up as well. As I was leaving, the cleaning lady advised that she had gone into the room prior to me getting there and realized someone was still there. She states her sheet showed the room empty and she was preparing the room for my arrival. It would've been nice if she had told me that before I barged into the room on these folks. How does a hotel this large and of this caliber not have an accurate accounting of the status of their rooms? I was already checked out of my previous room so this caused some stress. I went back downstairs and stood in line for another 30 minutes before I could speak with someone. The lady at the desk, not Bri, apologized and rechecked me into my room. She advised to call back in 2 hours. When I called back, the lady on the phone stated no Marquee suites were avail nor my original executive suite I reserved and to try back in another hour. I called back twice more hourly and got the same response. I went downstairs after the late checkout expired for my current room, which was now the normal check in time for the hotel, and was told no rooms were available. Asked how this was possible as it is now check in time. The lady at the desk advised that the Marquee suite that they checked me into early would no longer be available as they are letting the occupants stay another night and my original booked suite wouldn't be available either. She then states I could stay in the regular queen room for the same price. Yeah right, I guess I look like a fool if she thought I would pay the same amount for just a regular room vs a suite. It wasn't worth what I paid to begin with. She then states I could check back around 6-7pm. After much back and forth and her speaking with managers, I just advised that I wouldn't be staying at their property and to refund all the money that I had prepaid for 7\/8-7\/11. I then had to scramble and make same day, last minute reservation for a different resort. The ladies at the desk were all nice, never rude, but this was just ridiculous.

I did the on-line survey and received a response from the director of hotel operations stating that hotel makes every effort to satisfy guest preferences, the rooms are ultimately subject to availability during your stay. This doesn't translate to me getting keys to a room that is already occupied when I've already upgraded to a suite more than triple the initial reservation. Sorry, this is crazy and it was really embarrassing. 

I understand that there was a major event held there that weekend and knew that there would be some delays and lags, but the indifference was ridiculous. There are too many other hotels on the strip that are capable of managing their rooms efficiently.",1,0,0

In terms of the location, the MGM is a bit south of the happenin' part of the Vegas strip.  But then again, it really depends on what your itinerary is to decide on where it's happenin'. 

Room prices are decent when compared to the quality and type of room.  The rooms were renovated not too long ago and has some new furniture and decor to make it appear more contemporary.  However, compared to some of the newer hotels on the strip, you can definitely tell that this hotel is dated.

If you don't plan on staying in your room a lot, the price is about right.  Of course there are exceptions during the busy season when all the rooms in Vegas are all expensive, but other than that -- MGM is decently priced for the type of room you're getting.

Expect to wait in long lines during check in, especially if it's between 3pm to 6pm.  Also, if you have a bad back, don't stay at this hotel.  The mattresses are SOOOO uncomfortable.  I've stayed at this hotel multiple times and every time I come back, I remember why I never get a good night's sleep here.  It's not because I'm partying or staying up late gambling -- nope.  I can't sleep because the mattresses are way too soft and offer no back support.

I called the front desk on the first night of my recent stay and they were of no help.  They said that (1) all the rooms have the same beds and (2) that they were completed committed so they couldn't move my room.  Bleh. Whatevs... I just drank a lot to fall asleep. 

Other than that. Large casino, well-kept, and if you have Hakkasan (nightclub) , KA (cirque show), or Craftsteak (see my review on this restaurant) on your evening itinerary, it's worth staying here on your next trip to Vegas.",3,1,1

This probably would have been a 4 or 5 star review until I went to check out.  I discovered that they charged me $40 a day for something called a ""tech kit"".  Apparently the completely unmarked unremarkable plugs that were under the TV were special plugs that you get charged $40 a day to use.  I had no idea - these plugs were out just like every other plug, they had no special features that I could see, there was no warning that said use these and get charged $40 a day.

We went in the middle of the week, and when we got there and checked in I noticed that this place from the outside is huge and when you're inside.....it's even bigger!  

Now, I'm really bad with directions as it is, soooo with that being said, dropping me in the middle of this hotel and telling me to get to my room was almost cause for panic.  To say that this hotel is huge, is a total understatement.  I was almost afraid we wouldn't get to see all of our hotel, but.....

the nite we got there, hubby got sick, pretty  bad too.  Of course, I was bummed out, but what could I do right?  

hmmm.....hubby sick, too cold for him to go outside.  Weeelll off to Plan B......

eat at every single restaurant in the damn hotel.  

And we did.  

The buffet, the 24 hr cafe, Seablue, Shibuya, Craftsteak, Emeril's, Wolfgang Puck....and we may have missed one restaurant, but we pretty much did 'em all!  And with the exception of the buffet, every single restaurant there is damn good.  Craftsteak and Shibuya being amongst my faves....

We also did the show there, KA, and even though I reviewed the show a long time ago, I still rave about it to everybody I know!  It was an excellent show, and I would love to go back and see it, I'm sure there are things that I missed the first time around.......

The rooms are decent, bathrooms also decently sized.  The little sofa they have in the room is kinda stiff, but the bed was super comfy!  Housekeeping was great, room was always clean and extra towels were always brought up promptly as per our request :)

It's classy, but not overly ""museum pretentious"" like some of the newer places, the restaurants are EXCELLENT, their entertainment venue (Grand Garden Arena) has played host to several excellent shows, and honestly, I rate casinos here based off memories built and fun experiences.

They have a nice amount of entertainment here.  54 is a fun club.  ""Ka"" is a highly enjoyable Cirque show.  they have live lions here in their personal habitat.  I've heard of and seen pictures that they had a full theme park here, but that was before my time in Vegas, and I can only wonder now what that was like.  There are still tiny hints and remnants around the place, and I do remember it semi mid-transition.  It still has some ""theme"" elements left, like the recent ""CSI"" attraction that they added not too long ago.  It took the arcade's place, though there is a Gameworks right next door.

It's also in a good spot on the Strip, where you can easily walk to a lot of other casinos and venues, without feeling completely out of the way here.  that said, this place is huge.  If you've been walking around, and your feet are tired, this casino is not your friend.  I once made the mistake of trying to talk the outside of it to get to my car, thinking it really wasn't all that big.  Let my experience save you from making a similar lapse in common sense: Don't try that.

It's a middle road between ""expensive"" and ""all access"" depending on what you want to do at the place.  But it's still very nice, and the staff, right down to the people who valet your car, have always been pleasant in my experiences.

(3) the customer service at registration, 
(4) how comfortable the bed is, and

MGM gets my 5 stars. 
(1) we have an MLIFE players card and it ROCKS. 30% off shows, comp'd rooms, just for signing up (free). We use this every time we come to Vegas and this particular time, we got two nights for free (no resort fee or nothin'). Two thumbs up!
(2) Honestly- parking is a bit confusing, and the walkway forces everyone who doesn't valet it to go through this mild maze to get to the registration desk. Since we weren't elderly folk\/heavy packers, this wasn't a big deal.

Upon entering, there is a fragrance that is throughout the lobby ... couldn't quite place it, but pleasant nonetheless.  They also have videos behind the check in desk, I imagine in an effort to keep you occupied since the process of checking in takes an act of congress at any hotel in Vegas.

Contrary to what my associates said when they checked in, my little check in lady was very pleasant.  Perhaps she had just started her shift and hadn't had time to be beat down by people.  LOL.

I think my one complaint about this place was that I stayed in the main hotel and there was no coffee pot, yet the Signature has coffee pots in the rooms.  I get it, you want me to pay for coffee, like everything else, but can't a gal have one cup after rolling out of bed?!

As with all Vegas hotels, they pump oxygen into them which by Day #2, has completely made my nasal passages raw.  MGM was nowhere near as bad as over at Mandalay Bay, about doing this, but still enough to be annoying each morning.  

Lots of decent restaurants and bars.  I did not go to Tabu because I had read the reviews and opted not to waste my time.

All in all, it was a decent stay ... but had I had a coffee pot in my room, they might have earned an extra star!!",2,0,1

I had recent occasion to stay here and I was pleasantly surprised.  Check-in line looked like it had 400 people but I don't know how many were separate rooms.Still, checked in in 45 minutes and got a fine room in the tower-like the good old days.

Casino seems more orderly too.

They still have to watch screamers, beer parties in the rooms, and rough-necks but that was improved. These types are much less frequent at other 4-star properties in Vegas.

Good value for money. Everything ran like clockwork and staff, as usual, were very polite.

Whiskey Down: Cool looking old-style place that had about 5 customers and 4 wait staff and bartenders.  Took 15 minutes to get a drink and would have taken longer if not for excellent waitress, Lora.

The negative is for anyone who is parking here, it's a long walk! Always valet! If valet is full which happens on the weekends & with concerts you won't have an option and have to walk far.

The MGM Grand is a little over a 3.5 hotel in my book.

It's fairly priced, nice restaurants, lounges, stores, venues, and a wide range of casino games from high end bets to low end bets.

I think this hotel has a nice room, not great but nice.  The service for housekeeping needs improvement but for the most part its a good place to stay for the average traveler.  Its location is great for moving around to other casinos and they even keep Caged Lions in a man made den for all to see

Under the roof is one of the biggest casinos, a bazillion guest rooms, huge lobby with glittery gold stars on the ceiling, some restaurants and stores all around. 

Zoom in to one of the guest rooms and you will find nothing out of the ordinary. It was a decent enough room, but it wasn't as glitzy as the presentation space surrounding it. 

We had a bumpy beginning. We had to change rooms as the room they had given us had some sort of Hollywood search\/spotlights right outside and I was concerned that they might light up our room at night. We then waited for security at one point to open our door because the keycard was not programmed properly. Annoying but we got through it.

In another strange Hollywood moment:
we were having a nap and the privacy tag was on the doorknob. 
Someone's knocking. 
Before I even barely get something on, the door opens and this guy is walking in with champagne\/water\/and some sort of little dessert samples. 
Hubby is still in bed and is not happy and tells him so.  
The bellman tells us that the hotel wanted to thank us for choosing their hotel and was comping the bubbly for us. 
Not done with finesse I tell you that. 
OY! (Definitely a star loser)

So the pros:
Decent sized room, mostly clean.
Awesome king sized comfy bed.
A\/C worked fine and was not noisy.
Cool blackout shades that you push a button to raise up and down. 
Quiet even though right outside were lots of partiers.
Nice views of the hills.
Good sized tv.
Incredible pools! I mean incredible - including the lazy river pool!!! That was awesome.. floating down a river, that topped the review back out to a 3 star.
Servers were right there to serve you at the pool.
Cardio room was big enough and had adequate machines.
(Water bottles are not free though, unless you want to use the fountain there)
Free drinks at the MGM casino.
Tons of gambling machines and other gambling, and always open (that could be a con or a pro ;))
A decent enough buffet on the premises. (I loaded up on smoked salmon and smoked trout for breakfast).
Lots of elevators and not a lot of waiting.
You can actually check in at the airport though I never saw too bad of a line in the lobby.
In fact there are a few people that help you before you even get to the counter at the lobby.
The maids are very friendly.
In fact, most of the people working there were amiable.

Cons:
No fridge to put some of my own wine in. 
Fridge was full of their stuff that they wanted me to purchase. 
Even the water was 7.00 though down the street I could get same water for 2.29. I know, I know so what else is new in Vegas right? Well no reason to ignore the obvious nonetheless. Maybe they could change?
Um.. long red hairs in the bathtub.. not mine or hubbys.. 
No coffee machine to make 1st cup before going out the door. Guess why?? Starbucks all over the hotel.
Resort fee for: pool\/cardio room\/wifi
If I wanted to pay 15.00 more a day I could get the ""special"" spa cardio room. 
Nonsmoking not enforceable so you are smelling smoke in the halls (though the room did not smell at all)
You have to walk through the casino to get anywhere.
ATM in the casino wants 4.99 even though you will be taking that money and putting it right back into their machines. Slap!


Location is a little off the main strip but that might just be a good thing. It's a madhouse out there. We took their buses that run up and down the strip and they are clean and have a\/c of course. The stop is very close to the hotel.

When we got to the counter there were resort fees which we were aware of but the desk clerk asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an additional $25\/night.  Of course since we are on vacation we said okay.  The upgrade was supposed to be a bigger room (still average), access to place that really didnt interest us and free access to the spa (why i agreed). Well you still have to pay for services so in all actuality this upgrade was pointless. We still have the mentality tho we are in vegas lets have a good time. Well we go to the buffet and that was great then we got the casino which is where our problems begin. The first machine we got on broke and in took forever to someone to come look at it so we decided we would get someone. She said just sit there someone will see the light and come. We then said well lets get something to drink since no came i stopped a waitress who also said when you sit down and play someone will come. I have been playing and do you not see the light on top of my machine? I think it was rude of her, i didnt pick your job for you. Not soon after we called it a quit and when to our room. Only to say again we are in vegas our night can't end like this. So we went down to the bar.  Its called something bar and its going towards the north towers (im giving you directions so you can stay away). Either way someone finally came to take our order. We ordered 2 drinks. She asked if we wanted to start a tab or pay in cash. We said we will pay in cash she then said well you have to pay now. We did then asked for another set of drinks. She brought them back, we paid and it took forever for her to bring our change. We should have learned from this  but we order another set of drinks. She never brought our drinks nor did we see the money again. When i stopped her to ask her about it she said she was off and to deal with another waitress. The other waitress did bring our drinks but at this point where is the money you took from us. The manager got involved for nothing and said they are going to look at the camera and see what happened. I guess she thought that was going to scare us but I knew what i gave the waitress therefore i said please do. She never left, i watch as her and the waitress (who by the way is supposed to be off) laugh and giggle while security comes. They say they want to get an understanding and take our stories and then say they are going to look at the camera as well. The manager then comes back and says here are your receipts. I dont know who receipts they had or what they tried to doctor up. She says i gave her $100 bill the first time. I tell her i didnt give her a $100 bill until the 3rd transaction. She then says okay and comes back with some more receipts and this time no $100 is anywhere. How in the world can you say i have different receipts and to make matters worst your stories are the ones that are changing and why havent you looked at this camera yet? She then stated to the security guard i think they need to leave. If I didnt have a job that I need and an image as a member of the armed forces that i like to uphold this could have went alot differently, they basically stole $100 dollars from us. I have two more days here but i will not shop, gamble, or do anything else that involves them getting my money.

OK, so the guy banging on the wall for a half hour at 4 am wasn't the hotel's fault,but they could have corrected the problem faster. 

Seeing that we were already up at 4am decided to go to the Grand Canyon  (cold in January) but when we finally made it home at 8:30 PM the room still hasn't  been made up.  Trash cans full, bed not made, no clean towels.

An hour later and TWO call to the desk and still no one has come to clean the room. This is unacceptable even in a two star motor lodge, let alone in a Mega casino facility.  Maybe I should make it one star?  On top.of that we had my nephew's wedding and reception here and spent plenty.  Never again.

Definitely would NOT recommend.

Dropped the rating to 1 star. The front desk manager kept insisting the room had been cleaned. (No one had been here fot 2 days) Five calls to two different managers,, two and a half hours; 11:15 PM before our room is finally cleaned.   The Bates Motel would have done better...

I see no reason to not give 5 stars to the lovely and huge MGM Grand. The only thing people could really complain about is the location because it is so far down on the strip but I came to Vegas prepared to walk my butt off and that's just want I did! 

MGM has every slot machine you could possibly ask for, a good amount of gaming tables, the most awesome computerized roulette table, and is seriously a large enough casino that you could play at al day. The slots and roulette treated me very well (but not my boyfriend & friends!) so i was very lucky. I won over a thousand in roulette when only starting out with $50 and a good amount on the slots.

We ate at a few of the restaurants and the food court (all of which i'll review) and we were always pleased. 

The room was very nice and plenty large for my boyfriend and I. The bed was comfy and the mirrors in the bathroom were great for getting ready. Our view was not fabulous, we could only see the Tropicana, but still, quite a good room.

WIN) But after all of these years, I had never stayed there and darn it, I wanted to go to the pool and lazy river I'd been hearing about.  So, we used some MyVegas points to get a free night in the middle of our week stay in Vegas. Of course, we did have to pay a $35 resort fee, so not really free, but essentially, we paid $35 to hang out at the pool all day and just head up to our lovely room when we were done instead of going back to our regular digs next door at the Marriott Grand Chateau.  We also had our family who were in town come spend the day with us.

The pool:  All the things I wanted to know.  If you are staying at the hotel, you get to use the pool area, including the lazy river.  You can bring people in with you... I mean, I guess if you tried to bring 20 people, they may not allow it, but we brought four along with us and it was fine.  You can get as many towels as you need.  There are lots of chairs, but honestly, not much shade.  There are multiple pools and I think they all have cabanas and daybeds for rent, but we spent our day at the lazy river.  The SELL branded round inner tube style floats as well as a few other styles, all round for $25.  No renting, just buying.  However, you can bring your own with you as long as its round.  My fam brought regular small rafts with them, not knowing about the round rule at the time and so we tied them into a circle and made them round!  It worked!  But, be prepared, just bring your own...  that ticket is CRAZY for a piece of plastic!  They have bars where you can buy beverages, you can order food at the grill and they have servers that walk around and will get your food and beverage for you.   We had two orders of chicken tenders and fries and they were huge, so the two of us only ended up eating about one. the bar also has a water station, so you can get cups of water.  Overall, we enjoyed the day at the pool.  A little more shade would be nice, though.

The room:  The room was actually very nice.  It was your standard hotel room, king bed, non-smoking with a view of the airport and the Tropicana Hotel and south Strip.  Check in was a breeze because we currently have Gold status in MLife from a credit card offer... looks like that offer has changed, though, so I won't go into details on that.  If you have Gold status or hire, you don't have to wait in the long line to check in... and the line IS long because this place is massive and popular.  Our bed was comfy and the shower was okay, but not cleaned properly as there was hair in the shower.  Ew.  I enjoyed the bath products they provided, they were nice.  I don't often use the provided products, but I thought I'd try them and, the shampoo and conditioner were nice.

I actually gambled just a little and had some moderate success which was fun, the husband not so much success, OR fun.

There are so many food choices here which is awesome.  We ate at the Casual Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill which was yummy and no reservation was needed.  There are also several shows that take place and a nightclub (at least one), so you can actually stay at the MGM for a couple days easily without leaving!  Its very self contained.

Overall, it was a really nice experience and I would totally stay here again, I mean if I didn't have to pay for it.  I already have a home at my time share in Vegas, so staying at the other properties is fun, but I'm too cheap to actually pay for them!  But, of the places I have stayed on the Las Vegas strip over the years: Venetian, Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, & MGM, I'd say they all have really great options to them and any would be fabulous for a second stay.",4,1,3

We were married there 10 years prior in 2005. We purchased a wedding vow renewal package through the Forever Grand Chapel. After the ceremony the Forever Grand Photographer took us to various locations in the hotel to take pictures as part of our purchased package. When we began to take pictures in front of a fountain located in the west wing, Officer Whitson, abruptly and aggressively told us that we could not take pictures in front of the fountain. When he first approached us he referred to us several times as ""you people"" and automatically assumed we were there illegally. He was immediately abrasive towards us. We explained to him that we were just married in the Forever Grand Chapel and he still said we did not belong there. I asked for his manager, who he immediately radioed after my request.He then asked for ID from the Photographer and the photographer told him that he forgot his ID at the Chapel (because he was standing in for someone else) but could show him the pictures we just took in the Chapel to verify that he was hired by them. My husband showed him our room key to prove that we were staying in the hotel but he ignored him completely. His anger was not appropriate for the situation at hand.He was rude and disrespectful to us for no reason at all. I was in my wedding dress with my husband and our two children (6 and 8 years old) all dressed in wedding attire. The four of us along with the Forever Grand Chapel photographer were not threatening, loud, or disruptive towards other guests and in no way deserved to be treated in such a deplorable manner by this security guard. Officer Whitson at one point brazenly jumped in front of the camera after the Photographer explained to him that we are on a time schedule from the Chapel and had to continue as part of our package while he verified his affiliation with the Chapel. After his manager arrived and assessed the situation, he asked Whitson to leave because he was escalating the situation and was behaving erratically. 
We went to two other locations to take pictures and it was difficult because my children were traumatized by this security guards behavior. We had to field questions about the ""mean police man"" for the entire afternoon.  I was crushed that the event ended so poorly.  After we went back to our room, I took off my wedding dress, changed and returned to the same water fountain to find the main security office.  I spoke with another security officer and explained the situation to him and he was so shocked at how we were treated. He immediately escorted me to the main security office where I spoke to the manager on duty. She stated she had been briefed on the situation and was expecting me. She told me that the Chapel should have gotten clearance from the PR department and to me made several excuses for why the incident happened. I explained to her, that I have no idea how the MGM operates behind doors and regardless, if their PR department was notified or not that we were taking pictures, we should not have been treated so badly by one of her officers. Very unsatisfied with my interaction with her, I was instructed to fill out a complaint and I left. We were celebrating our love in the same facility where we were married ten years prior and it was completely ruined by employees of MGM Grand Security.

When we finally arrived to check in, one of the receptionist, Claris (Claris, we didn't get your last name) went out of her way to take care of us, and even gave us several complimentaries  that we totally didn't expect and made sure we were fully accomodated.  More than that though, we were impressed with her complete professionalism and her comforting and welcoming words to four very tired, very disheveled people who could surely use them!  The night ( ? - don't know the proper title) manager also came by and made everything go smooooooooth.  They were awsome!

My husband was in town for a conference which was being held at the MGM Conference Center, so that is why we stayed here. We stayed in a standard room with two queen beds (we had friends who came up for a night) that was more than adequately sized. The bathroom is pretty average for a hotel - I must prefer the bathrooms at Aria and Palazzo.

The hotel is still a maze to get around and you will walk...a lot! The trek from the room elevators to the conference center is long; the walk from the elevators to the pool is long; and the walk to the sports book (especially if you are going from the pool) is long. But it's a good chance to work off all the food and booze! 

The MGM pool complex remains one of my favorite pool areas in Vegas, even if cocktail service is sporadic and slow. At the end of September at 10:30 am it was not hard for me to snag a chair mere steps from the pool. We did not dine at any of the MGM restaurants, but we did have drinks more than once at Whiskey Down (I had several very friendly waitresses there), watched Sunday football at Centrifuge (buckets of beer for $25 and much more comfy than the sports book), and watched several sporting events at the sports book (again I had several nice waitresses there). Taxi lines were non-existent so you walked out the door and into a cab. Plus getting to and from the airport is super easy and around $10-13 depending on traffic. 

As a tip, if you are heading out to walk the Strip or just want to buy cheap beer without paying $8+ for it or gambling, walk to the sports book, make a right, and go out the doors in that area. There is a convenience store when you walk out where you can get $3.50 24 oz cans of beer to take with you while walking. Also it's a good shortcut to get directly onto the Strip.",1,0,0

It's so deceiving, you think you're getting a good deal then you're hit with a $25 or sometimes even more resort fee. Why can't they just do a straight forward price? That's why I like booking with Harrahs properties.

The other bad thing? Our room keys stopped working after a housekeeper walked in at 10pm. Okay, first of all, if I wasn't so tired from walking around and not having slept the night before, I would have flipped out and called management on her. She had no business in our room and didn't even do a courtesy knock, just slipped her key in and let herself in our room. WTF?!

This is also the first hotel I've stayed at where they don't have a double lock on the door that will let you prevent such housekeepers from disturbing your privacy even though you already have the do not disturb sign hanging on the door knob.

Now that that's out of the way, here's what I liked:

- Newly renovated rooms! Comfy bed, oh my! Flat screen and rather beautiful decor. Love the shades, we left it open so when I woke up at the crack of dawn, I enjoyed the view.

- Grand Pool: wow, wow, and another wow. Considering that this is the first time I've ever been to a Vegas pool, I was rather impressed. Multiple pools and a lazy river? Yes, please!!! We took a lap at the lazy river and it was really fun. We didn't even have floaters, just walked and sometimes swam and floated. All their pools are 3 1\/2 feet deep from what I saw.

- Take the customer survey. Not only do they give you a 20% off on your next stay, you might even get a reply addressing your concerns from their management. 

Right now, they are undergoing renovations and are pushing reservations by offering 15% off and free buffets with two night minimum stays.

Sorry MGM, can't say I'm a fan of your resort fees!",15,11,12

Las Vegas;MGM Grand Hotel 
Went to Vegas for a conference and stayed at the MGM grand. The room was modern, clean and well designed. The best part of this hotel room is the view of the airport! I get to see airplane coming in and landing at McCarran every 3 minutes. I think this is the best show in Vegas. Despite being so close to the airport, the room is surprisingly quiet. Not a sound or vibration was heard. This room was advertise for 79.99 on hot wire. Remember they charge resort fees per room. 

It was good for the money. If you rate the room only, I would have given MGM grand 5+ stars, given the view of the airport and the technology in room and the decor with the ample sunlight. but then I just remembered I had to put up with a lot of crap on my stay there. You got a feeling that they just don't care about an average costumer like us. So we'll put this hotel on the ""could use improvement"" category. 

I started the review giving this hotel 5 stars, but kept taking stars off as I write the ""Con"" section...

Con: check in line took an hour and fifteen minutes. (not kidding) I was already *not in the mood* after a long day of budget air travel, by the time I got to the front desk I was totally pissed off. They have like 25 check in counters but only 3 of them were staffed. Clearly they don't care about the long line of dying people. There were mangers around but they just stood around and done nothing to help the situation. Check luggage on my way out was impossible given the mid day line and a mid day schedule, I waited 20 minutes and said ""fu*k this*. Front desk was well mannered but not helpful. Like they took a class on how to decline all your request without being offensive. Unless you are a whale you are nobody here. Early morning window cleaning (from the outside) could had been intrusive for the people who likes to stay in their hotel room nude. A cable guy showed up in the middle of the day and spent 45 minutes working on my TV set. The guy was polite, but what if I was trying to get lucky?",0,0,0

Some of the rooms are themed by actors from hollywood's golden era which give it alot more character than the average hotel on the strip.  The beds are extremely comfortable and might even be the best i've slept on in vegas.  The gym\/spa facility downstairs is $20 a day per person to use but can't compare to the one at Mandalay Bay for the same price.  It's located next to the pool level which I give 4.5 stars for its cleanliness, cabanas, and layout.  Very tasteful.  Only complaint about the pool is that they close it down if there's even the slightest chance of a thunder\/lightning storm.  I always end up eating at the Rainforest Cafe since its the only place open at 3:00am.  The menu there is sandwiches, burgers, etc. and the food is so-so.   When I need coffee there's starbucks, when I want a quick bite there's 'wichcraft, and if you want upscale japanese there's shibuya downstairs.

btw - if you're in need of a limo, mgm is where treasure island, new york new york, bellagio, and mirage dispatch their drivers from.  ask for a driver by the name of cedric cuz he's funny as hell and knows what's going on in vegas : )",4,0,4

A staffer informed me that if I signed up for the MLife rewards card, that would enable me to check in at the faster check in line. She also told me the parking fee would be covered. So I stood in the MLife rewards line for 40 minutes, only to discover that the entry Sapphire level entitled me to none of those things. I went back to the main check in line and waited for 1 1\/2 hours to check in. I expressed my displeasure to the clerk, and she said she would ""take care of me.""

She assigned me a room in the West Wing, and when I entered, I discovered the hard way that it was OCCUPIED. Imagine if that had been your room!

I went back to the front desk, expressed my displeasure, and they ""upgraded"" me to a regular room in the Grand Tower. They also informed me that although I experienced an inconvenience, they could not comp my parking fee.

We like the location because it has a Monorail station, plus it is easy to get to from the airport.  This was our first time staying at MGM Grand, though we have dined here several times before.

Check in was easy, and it was easy to find our room - the atria is clearly labeled with what floors each elevator goes to, and once you arrive on your floor each hallway is clearly labeled with what room numbers are on each hall. 

We upgraded to a remodeled room and it was great. King bed, beautiful bathroom with waterfall shower pressure, hair dryer and makeup mirror. The bed was comfortable, the blackout shades made it perfectly dark, and the shower was hot and relaxing.

I only gave it 4\/5 for two reasons: 1. Our room had a door to the adjoining room. There was a group of men in the next room who spoke VERY loudly each night and we could hear every word (in a different language, but nevertheless it was loud and annoying) 2. One day our towels weren't replaced during room servicing. We were able to get them the following morning from the housekeeping cart, and it was only a minor inconvenience. 

Staff was pleasant, the hotel smelled fresh, and the signs made it easy for us to find whatever we needed. We will definitely consider staying here again, though we do like to try new places (this is our 6 hotel we've stayed at in Vegas thus far).",1,0,0

First thing I noticed in MGM Grand was that there's no one organizing the crowds for check-in\/out, everyone just had to find a lucky line to get in, like the supermarket style. Our check-in process was smooth except that we found out our rooms were hundreds of numbers apart, so we went back in line to ask for a closer distance, and the CSR replaced another room right next to each other - so why didn't he just do that the first place? Obviously that room wasn't taken. Than we bumped into a huge disappointment after we entered our rooms - bulky TV, no fridge, no blow dryer. Later I found out that my sink (not sure about the other room's) couldn't drain properly, I had pause washing my face so the water wouldn't over float... Pillows weren't comfortable either. The next morning we were waiting for elevators for over 15min (not kidding) with other 20+ ppl on the 10th floor and noticed that only 2 out of 6 elevators would open, but both were full every time they opened. Finally a janitor offered us staff elevators so we could leave but the security guard just had to ruin it. He let us in, but had to tell us how the janitors weren't supposed to offer us staff elevators because we weren't staff. We complained to the CSR when we checked out and they only wanted the security's name, but our concern was the 4 broken elevators that wouldn't open, and wanted them to deliver the msg to every staff, including securities, that guests are being trapped so pls open the staff elevators.

We stayed in a Marquee suite. The suite is spacious; it has two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a large living room area with a pool table. One of the benefits of staying in a suite is you don't stand in the general check-in line, which is usually really long because there are thousands of room at this property. The check-in line for guests staying in suites is much shorter. The only reason why I'm not giving them five stars is because the suite did NOT come with a refrigerator or microwave. I've stayed at cheap hotels before and their rooms come with microwaves and refrigerators. So for a hotel like MGM to not provide that is unacceptable.

This is by far my favorite casino in Vegas. I love the layout, the crowd, the variety, the dealers and even if you find yourself short on luck at the tables, you can always just go stare at some lions.

I have only eaten at one restaurant in the resort - Seablue. I wasn't too hungry upon entering it, but I recall coming out fully satisfied. It is a little pricey - especially the seafood appetizer that charges per person at the table. 

I would avoid the CBS Television City attraction as it's really just a ploy for CBS is show you a bunch of commercials and ask you what you do and don't like about them. Your time could be much better spent.

The pool is the best on the strip, in my opinion. Great crowd, fun crowd, tons of pools - each with its own flavor.

You know, the one star reviews you read because someone had some specifically odd situation that led to problems and an eventual ranting on their Yelp business page, but it's probably something that wouldn't necessarily apply to you ""moments."" Want to know more? Read on. Otherwise, just know the MGM Grand is a pretty decent Vegas hotel.

Still with me? Okay, maybe the MGM Grand is relatively prestigious. They sure emanate that feeling throughout the casino, bars, hotel rooms, and restaurants. It's not pretentious, but rather contemporarily classy. This was partly why MGM was chosen as a place of residency for a quick Vegas trip I took with my family. 

Throughout the stay, we encountered mostly-friendly employees and no big dilemmas (except the one). Well, we did have to ask a few times to get extra towels, but the place is huge so I'll cut them a little slack on that. It's big enough to be a stop on the Vegas monorail which worked out wonderfully for me in leisurely getting down to the Stratosphere. Oh and the pool? Woah. Massively-sized with multiple spots to chill (including a formidable lazy river). Don't forget the clubs (Wet Republic by day and Hakkasan by night) which might just add to the fact that you'll never want to sleep in Vegas (in a good way, I think).

All that is fine and dandy, and would've resulted in a four star review, had it not been for the following mishap. We booked our stay through a travel site and chose to take a red eye flight home, but instead of checking out in the morning on that final day, we wanted to pay for that last night (even though we'd be out of the room by 10PM) just so we would have a place to go to rest up and relax until it was time to depart to the airport. 

When we checked in, everything was under my name and we reexplained the situation to the friendly employee at the front desk. She noted it and didn't say we needed to do anything else...only problem was that last day, around the late afternoon, my family was locked out of our room. None of the keys worked and they called me unsure what to do. I was several hotels away from MGM so I called up only to hit a roadblock of a person on the phone that stated there was nothing she could do to help me over the phone and I needed to be there in person to update the info so they could be let in. At this point I was calmly furious and explained how nothing was said to us about any of this possibly happening and someone should've informed us at the front desk or to at least have someone else's name on the room so there wasn't a problem. Somehow, after going through this all a few times, the woman was miraculously allowed to let my family in as long as I answered a few security questions. Wow. Really? 

I finally headed back and went to the front desk to explain how this was a ridiculous way to end a vacation and the woman who helped me was incredibly empathetic and understanding. She was able to get her manager to knock off some money for that final night and lower the room rate (I mean, we weren't actually staying over so that made some sense). But the damage had still been done and it left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth for MGM.

Overall, like I said, this isn't an instance or situation that usually (or maybe ever) happens to people, but it happened and from that, MGM Grand loses a star. I may be back in Vegas in a year or so for a bachelor's party, and despite a mostly positive stay, MGM Grand might not be my first choice. Then again, if we book things normally, perhaps we'll get lucky (Vegas joke) and things will go smoothly.",17,10,13

Favorite casino on the strip, and the pool can keep you from losing your money so easily as it is a blast! I also appreciated no pushy sales people unlike other casinos.

It smells clean, the details are lovely, and if you book at the right times you can get an amazing rate. We paid $100 a night during the middle of the week! They held our luggage until check in time, and the process in doing so was easy and professional. We were checked in promptly, and the worker helping us said our rate was simply amazing. Though, my only complaint was that the room we booked online looked modern and upgraded. He informed us that the room they'd be giving us would not be. I'm assuming because of the low rate we paid. Therefore, he asked if we wanted to upgrade for $30 a night for their ""Stay Well Suite."" We opted to do so and it was the best choice ever. We then pushed a little for something complimentary. Why not try the luck? After informing him that it was my birthday, he gave us free tickets to the MGM Buffet. He told me Happy Birthday and suggested some places for us to go on the Strip. The entire check-in experience was wonderful and we were treated like valued customers. I couldn't have asked for more.

On the way to our room, we were constantly surprised by just how gorgeous this hotel is. The casino leaves something to be desired, but it's a lot cleaner and less smoky than many of the ones we visited. It's on par with the Bellagio and Cesar's Palace, minus the beautiful sky scene. The Stay Well Suites have their own tower in the hotel, and a fountain in the middle that divides the sections. The fountain is breathtaking, as well as the elevator hallway. It's really something you just have to see for yourself. When we arrived to our room, we realized we had a semi-strip view. We didn't know we'd get a great view, so you can imagine the excitement there. The upgrade was completely worth it. The shower is infused with a Vitamin-C diffuser so that it streams through the water while you shower. There's a sound cube that plays sounds for you in case you have trouble sleeping. The bathroom had different lighting options for the mirror, which was a great touch. All the sheets and pillows are hypoallergenic, and extremely comfortable. The room felt clean and crisp, and smelled fantastic when we arrived.

We ate at the MGM buffet, and it was a decent little spot to catch a quick bite. A bit pricey for those who pay to eat, though. The service was good, and afterwards, we headed to concierge to find out about our Cirque Du Soleil show in the hotel. We had questions about when the show started, and the staff working were amazing when it came to answering our questions and offering suggestions on where to eat and places to go. They treated us like extremely valued guests, and I was genuinely surprised at how kind all of the staff are. We saw Ka in the MGM Theater, and I highly suggest this show. We weren't staying on a peak night, so the theater was about half full and we moved a little closer to be nearer to the action. It was absolutely wonderful. I was worried from reviews that it wouldn't be as thrilling as higher-ticket shows such as ""O"", but it left both my girlfriend and I feeling really satisfied with our choice.

The hotel is the largest on the strip, so sometimes getting from place to place can be quite a hike. We took the LV monorail system quite a lot, and it was a bit of a walk to get there from our Wing of the hotel. The pool area is also a fair bit away, so keep that in mind while booking. It is definitely worth the walk, however. The pool at the MGM was actually the reason we chose this hotel over several others. The lazy river is amazing and includes a waterfall area that we thought was just beautiful. Within the lazy river, there are areas that are quite fun, such as a wall of water that beats down on you like heavy rain. Details like this make this pool area top notch compared to a lot of other hotels on the strip. There are other pools you can visit, though some of them were closed during certain hours. They opened them up eventually, and you could escape to these low populated areas when the others got a little too busy. There are lifeguards on duty and located sporadically around the pool area, so if you have kids, they're likely to be safe and well looked after. Even during week days, the pool was booming with action. I assume during weekends and peak periods it would be extremely busy and crowded. However, it's simply too great of an amenity to miss out on. 

Checking out was also a breeze. We received the same wonderful service as we did arriving. The hotel once again held our baggage while we walked around the Strip for a few more hours. There was fruit infused water located in the lobby, as it was a high heat day. It was delicious and the kind of gesture we got used to staying here. The workers simply know how to treat their customers. It may have just been our experience, but I hope you all receive the kind of stay we did.",4,1,1

I haven't stayed here since I was a kid so I was semi-excited to come back. The hotel itself doesn't have very many eye-catching restaurants or decorations. I'd say the only thing to look forward to is Hakkasan. They have plenty of casinos and a fair amount of restaurants in their food court. There's also a Fat Tuesday near the parking garage! 

I visited with my friends and we booked two hotel rooms, but they ended up upgrading us to one of their biggest suites because there was a convention going on.

We stayed in the West Wing and since I hadn't read the reviews, wasn't concerned about what I would find. It was a small, cozy but updated room...with small window to see part of the strip.

Being in Vegas, I didn't think we would get nickel & dimed, but this was softly the case. No fridge (unless you want to pay $50\/night), no coffee (after spending nights in Vegas??), and the monopoly of paying for parking even when we're staying multiple nights in the hotel. The cable went out occasionally and the WiFi didn't work one of the mornings.
 
We didn't have hot water some days which was infuriating, after traveling during the day and coming back to go out at night. Very disappointing, I was happy to get home to a hot shower.

We had a winter special with the room, so we had buffets comped for every day we stayed. I'll be honest with you -- if it wasn't free, it's not worth it, especially at $25-$35 per meal. Thankfully, it was a slow crescendo in terms of quality from the dinner, brunch to Christmas dinner (granted -- only once a year), but over-all, it wasn't better than dining hall food at any college. I'd much rather spend $30 per meal for small portions of higher quality. Props for the bottomless Mimosas at brunch though!

Also, the all-you-can-drink for $18 is a steal! Tony working the bar is so nice and amazing. Apparently, he usually works summers at Wet Republic only.

In the end, I'll probably stay here again because it's centrally located, affordable, and has many things to do in the Casino -- but with better room and more exploration of its unique restaurants.",6,1,1

First of all, it is so convenient that they allow you to check in at the terminal in the airport. If you mistakenly wait until you arrive at the hotel to check in, you will understand why. I even left a tip. PLEASE do yourself a favor and check in at the airport.
I had to wait a bit to check in to my room because my room was not available until about 3:30pm. I wasn't very happy about it, but they did me a huge favor and brought a mini fridge to my room for free as a nice gesture (the room did not come with one).
The resort is huge, and although I could have passed the time walking through the mall, I didn't want to carry my luggage around with me because it was heavy. In the meantime, by friend and I went to eat in the Rainforest Cafe. Came back, checked in to our room, and all was well. I would like to assume most rooms have really good views, and they are pretty spacious. Another poster said that she could smell\/hear the people near here, I did not have that experience. I actually didn't hear anything from those near me and they must not have carried about my best friend and I having late night laughing sessions after getting in from the club at 4am.
The lazy river was really amazing! There is a good mix of people- older people who are spending money frivolously and younger people who are ready to party. Bieber was performing at the arena the day I arrived, so of course there were a few teenagers but apparently that is not the norm.

MGM is so ridiculously big! We checked in and had no idea where our room was and we didn't know which tower to go to. Aimlessly walking around the Casino, we had to stop and ask three workers how to get to our room and which tower to take. We finally find the tower (the signs confused us more which was why we asked the staff there) and proceeded to take the elevator to our room. Tell me why our room was on the freaking 13th floor?  Like there was the number 13 on the elevator! I thought the number 13 is superstitious, hence buildings skip the 13th floor, using it as storage or whatnot right?! Anyway, we settle into our room and I remember it being just ok. It wasn't breath taking, but then again it wasn't gross like Imperial Palace! It was comfortable so I was happy! So the rooms check out in my book!

The casino is nice! Lots of slot machines, tables, great bars, café\/restaurants and of course the cool Lion! I've only seen the Lion once but I would love to see him\/her again.  

I like that I can sit at the bar, stick in a $20, play $.50 and order a few drinks without getting hassled by  the bartender that I have to play max credit and to hold off on ordering another drink because I JUST ordered one. The bartender at MGM was cool and served us drinks and chatted with us. That's what I like!

Downside is that it's at the end of the strip!

The reason it is my favorite hotel is simply because of the Terrace Suites.  If you are going to get a suite in Vegas, I don't think you can find a better suite for the price.

The Terrace Suites are two-story, 1,300sq ft suites that are nice -- nothing special -- until you step out onto the 700 sq ft terrace over-looking the strip, with a private jacuzzi.  Now THAT'S Vegas.  The suites are basically on those large steps you see going down the exterior of the MGM.  For me, it doesn't get better than that starting at $900\/night.

My business partner and I threw our ""we just sold our little internet company"" party here -- and it was excellent.  The worst part about the suite was that you didn't want to leave because hanging out on the terrace was just too cool.  But, you should leave, because the casino at the MGM is also fun.

Friendly dealers, lots of blackjack tables with reasonable minimums, and a younger, unpretentious crowd.  That really sums up the casino.  So many casinos in Vegas make me feel defensive and intimidated -- dealers telling me what to do (despite my knowing how to play), and lots of people who are sure they are really important.  I just don't get that vibe at MGM and it makes me a happy gambler.

Lastly, the pool.  It's nothing too special, but honestly, floating around the tube-river is a pretty good hangover remedy.  On a side-note, I witnessed a balloon-off at the pool (two people -- one with ballons -- who knew how to make balloon animals, competing to make an animal the fastest).  Totally impromptu and coincidental.  That can't happen often.  Too bad I didn't have that same kinda luck at the tables.",4,2,4

I explained that I am 6' 3"" and that the upgrade was actually a downgrade for me since I am longer than the bed. I asked if she could please switch me to a King bed. She said I would have to go up to the 7th floor and wait for security to open the room for me and then call the bellman who would bring me the keys since she was unable to successfully transfer the keys to the new room. I asked if she could just send me the bellman with the keys to the room I was in so I did not have to carry all my stuff to the room and wait for security but she actually told me no! I said ""wait, I am trying to understand why you cannot just send him here"". After some lame excuse, I went to the 7th floor, gained access to my room and was very amused to find a room with two full beds...Again, same issue I relocated to correct. It would have been hilarious except I was late for a dinner meeting and very much irritated. I kept the room because I had to get to my business dinner meeting but had a very rough night with my feet hanging way off the end of the bed. The room was not very clean either with long hair in my bed and used toilet paper on the floor in the bathroom. I wonder if someone had transferred out of the room prior to it being cleaned. The room also smelled stale.

P.S.
My colleague traveling with me also ordered a King bed and received a ""free upgrade"" as well. When he walked into his room there was someone actually occupying the room with suitcases and trash everywhere. He was transferred to another room but did not receive the King bed either.

Unfortunately that wasn't going to be for another 8 hours & my fiance and I needed to get home. We decided to wait. In the mean time we were able to buy ourselves new clothes, underwear & shoes. We also had lunch & the MGM was nice enough to cover the cost with no issues as long as we presented them with receipts. 

    The end of the day came & our belonging were nowhere near ready. Risk management offered to send it via Fed-Ex so that we could start our journey home. We left and stayed in contact with them. Once our stuff arrived we sent a list back to Risk management of all our belongings that got damaged & was unrepairable. They didn't hesitate to offer to pay for the things as long as we sent receipts & pictures.

I think it was wedding luck hehe. The cocktail waitresses were kind of rude, but at least we were getting free cocktails for gambling. All the dealers at the tables were very nice also.

One thing to note for anyone planning to stay here- DO NOT by bottles of alcohol at the hotel. Go a little ways down the sidewalk to the Grand Canyon Experience store and get it there. You'll save a ton of money that way!",0,0,0

There were scuffs on the walls and blisters on the furniture. (See photo)

There were holes in the bath room wall from where an old mirror use to be. ( See photo)

The walls were pretty thin as we were able to hear the noisy folks next door.

Earlier in the week, I was staying at the Encore. And I was planning to stay the whole week there.  But I had received a marketing offer from MGM Grand to stay at a special rate in one of their suites.  The marketing photos on their web site looked nice enough.  So I decided to stay 2 days out of the week there.    

The decor and ambiance at the Encore was so much better and well worth the extra price.  Compared to the Encore, the MGM Grand was a big step down.",0,0,1

I had a thought...do I need to go downstairs to order room service? To request a late checkout? To request a rollaway bed? Any of these things? Because that could certainly pose a security threat as well...ludicrous logic.

The supervisor I spoke to was named Yvette for the record, in case management happens to view this.

They have a new pool that's similar to what Tao Beach is, but we just chose to hang out at one of their many pools, which has bars and music too.  I love hanging out at the pool and being lazy with a drink.  My idea of a great vacation! For dinner we wanted to eat at Shibuya but they were closed, so we ate the Grand Wok and Sushi Bar. We also got 2 free drink tickets for the bar, which was another plus.  After dinner we went back to our room and I found flower petals all over the room and champagne.

However, we recently stayed here for a staycation and we had the best ""vegas hotel"" experience out of every place we have been on the strip, and that includes all of the 5-star resorts such as Venetian\/Palazzo, Wynn, Mandalay\/TheHotel, etc.  

I had booked a suite at this property because they have some of the most affordable suites on the strip, at about $100 a night on a weekday.  However, when we got there and found out we were celebrating a special occasion, they bumped us up to a Terrace Suite for free, which goes for probably $1500 - $3000 a night depending on the day.  This was literally the best room we have stayed in, anywhere in this town.   It was spectacular, and I have new respect for the MGM Grand.  So much that I'm not sure I will ever stay anywhere else but here.

Here's some photos of the room itself:

The rates are hard to beat and the pool is the best on the strip.  While in Vegas, we walked in and out of a bunch of the other hotels and none of them had the fun and exciting atmosphere quite like the MGM.  The hotel is huge and you will walk; A LOT.  There's so much to do for everyone at this hotel; you will never be bored.  (If so, it's Vegas, there's plenty more to do).  The rooms have recently been updated and the beds are super comfortable.  The staff at the front desk was incredibly helpful and kind at check-in and the gentleman who checked us in, Jacob, really hooked us up with a great view of the pool and the strip.  I've never had a problem with the cleanliness at the hotel.  The only problem (and this is not just the MGM) is the fact that smoking is still allowed in all casinos.

The rooms were to be discounted 30% because we were coming in with a group, only to find out that we were charged the regular rate.  Please, this was no regular hotel room, it was a glorified motel room and when I inquired about the state of the room, I was informed that the rooms had simply been remodeled from the old Marina Motel\/Hotel from many years ago and linked to the rest of the hotel.  If you are not clusterphobic, you will become one.  You walk in to the bathroom first and then get to your room.  The A\/C unit is your nightstand.  The drawers for your clothes are old but painted, looks like something out of the fifties.  There is no room on the sink counter for you to put your brush let alone your make-up bag or anything else.  There are no hooks to hang anything.  After taking a shower, you need to walk into the bathroom stahl to grab a fresh towel, since there is no where to put it.  Why is the shelving for the fresh towels over the toilet seats, I couldn't begin to explain....  The chairs in the roms will give you vericose veins.  They are very uncomfortable. 
Here is the great part, there is nothing that divides the bathroom from the bedroom really but a unsealed glass door.  So, watch out!  Should you have a bowel movement, expect to relish in the aroma for your entire stay since there is no aspirator or anything else to help vent the room.  The room is dark, the window is a 3'x3' opening.  It is a coffin.  Now for the bed.  Since it is impossible to sleep next to the air conditioning unit, everyone must sleep on the other side and therefore, the mattress is lumpy.  I went to management to express my disappointment and they really don't care....It is all about their bottom line and not about the guest experience and this guest will NEVER go back to the MGM or any of its affiliates.  Spare yourself the agony and go somewhere else.  Keep your dignity.

I went to play at the MGM Grand two different times during my stay in Vegas and got two different experiences each time. Note: I did not stay at the MGM, so this does not include any rating for the hotel - just the casino and the food.

On my first visit, it seemed that all the tables were, at a bare minimum $15 for blackjack and craps. I asked one of the pit bosses if there was anything cheaper and he said if I went to the back pit, far from the front doors, I could find a $5 table. I didn't see one back there, so I asked that pit boss, and she permitted to me to play for $5\/hand at a table that was just starting up. It was a little odd though because she made other people who joined later play $15\/hand but kept letting me play for $5 because I was ""grandfathered in"" - I can't complain but I felt bad for the other players that weren't necessarily getting a fair deal.

The second visit was a poorer one. I went to go redeem a ticket at the sports book and there were 3 windows open. All of the guys working the windows were taking their good old time chatting up the young ladies that were placing bets. I waited, the only person in line, for over 5 minutes before finally one woman finished and left the window. I walk up to the window and the supervisor comes over and says ""sir, they'll get you at the other two windows"" and changes this employee's sign to ""closed."" Good customer relations would mean letting me cash in my ticket real quick instead of directing me to another window that was still busy with the same people as before.

For this reason, I probably won't be gaming at MGM on future Vegas trips. Their loss.

The food was ""meh."" At the two cafes there, the coffee at each of them was horrible. Go to Starbucks instead.",0,0,0

Everywhere we went we were treated to smiling faces and courteous help from various staff--at the pool, the concierge, M-Life desk, Ka box office, and many others! We got a free fridge when I mentioned I accidentally moved one of the priced items in the mini bar to make room for leftovers. And it was nice to get birthday wishes from almost everyone who checked my ID; they genuinely seemed to care!  I'm not used to this exceptional customer service at most Vegas hotels I have stayed at. 

I picked the MGM Grand first and foremost because of their  MASSIVE and DIVERSIFIED POOL area.  I'm content to lounge like a lioness in the sun all day, taking a dip once in awhile to cool off, while my husband likes to PLAY! Here he can go join the pool-wide volleyball game while I relax poolside or go to one of several other pools on the property if I want to get away from the noise (except when Wet Republic is on; there's no escaping those boots and pants! and boots and pants!).  Then we can meet up at the lazy river (and he can push me around in a tube, of course).   

The MGM also has COMFORTABLE and REASONABLY PRICED rooms and the rates are comparable to other strip hotels of the same star rating that don't offer nearly the space, styling, or amenities that the MGM has.  

We also like the relative close PROXIMITY to the CENTER of the STRIP because we love to visit other hotels and enjoy all the touristy stuff Vegas offers (still gotta see the Bellagio fountains and the Mirage volcano each trip).  I've also really come to favorite the Grand Spa after trying other spas at various hotels. 

My hubby and I are a big arts and entertainment fans and we always see at least one show when we're in Vegas.  This trip we wanted to see Ka which is at the MGM so that was a bonus to staying there. 

I didn't give the full five star rating because of two moderate inconveniences: the media center and Internet devices had multiple bright lights that lit up our otherwise  darkened room. We had to use clothing, towels, and furniture to make a little fort to shield us from the light so we could get to sleep! And yes, we thought of unplugging everything but the outlet was unreachable. 
Also, sometime around 3 am on the last night of our stay, I was awakened by the sound of some kind machine outside--it was like a leaf blower on roids! I think they were performing maintenance to the roof of the shopping and restaurant wing below our tower.  It was obnoxious and and I needed to pop in my earbuds and watch some Netflix to drown it out and fall back asleep.",1,0,0

We had originally booked a non-smoking premier king with a view of the strip and arrived at the hotel at 5pm. Apparently checking in begins at 3pm and if you do not arrive in time (and wait in the extremely long line that begins way before 3pm) you are not guaranteed a room. 

This would have been very helpful to know when we had reserved the room initially, we could have planned out trip to arrive before check in but since this fact was never mentioned they gave our room to someone else. We ended up getting a staywell king room with a view of another building. What was the point of making a reservation anyway? We have stayed on the Las Vegas strip before (at Wynn, a very satisfying experience you get what you pay for) and we had never heard of this practice anywhere else. 

We were very tired that night since we had an early day hiking in the Grand Canyon then driving from there to Vegas and catching a late night show. We tried to go to sleep around 1AM when the occupant of the room adjacent to us came back around 2AM. She began slamming her door, screaming on her phone outside in the hallway, and throwing things in her room. She also called several of her friends to come to her room to listen to her scream about a girl she hated. Her friends were also loud, laughing and screaming with her. We called hotel security about 5 times that night, they came up 3\/5 times we called. The racket lasted until 4:30AM. The only thing security did was knock on their door and ask them nicely to be quiet. Weakest security team I've ever seen, super passive aggressive. Of course as soon as they left the racket started again. 

When we complained and requested a room change, they said they could not do anything for us. They offered two free breakfast buffets at their hotel, fuck that. We talked to customer service again the following morning, requesting a room change and they said they could move us to the room we originally requested but that we would have to call back between 2-4pm. So we called at 2pm, they said they didn't have any rooms available to move us so we pressed harder until they said they had a room but it needed to be cleaned. They gave us the run around for an additional 2 hours before we finally got the room changed back to what we had originally reserved. 

All the pools are also packed were you can't even attempt to swim unless you come between 9:00-10:15AM. 10AM is when the lazy river opens so that's when the crowd arrives. The lazy river is the only redeeming quality this hotel has got going for it. 

Overall horrible experience, terrible customer service, would not recommend coming here unless you don't care what room you get and  you weren't planning on sleeping or relaxing in your hotel room anyway. We will not be coming back to stay at this hotel, get what your money's worth and actually stay at a nice hotel that cares about its customers.

It will give you spa access every day to use the fitness, steam, sauna and jacuzzi. My favorite thing about staying at the MGM is the pool. They have a lazy river and it's fun to float about and read a book and people watch. 
 I am not a big fan of the decor of the rooms at the MGM. The stay well rooms have air purifiers, scent cubes, black out curtains and Vitamin C infused showers and upgraded beds. The beds are super comfortable. I don't like black out curtains because I like to see sunlight to help wake up in the morning. The green glow from the MGM lights at night in my room made it hard to sleep. My eyes were blood shot every day and night and I think it's due to all the cigarette smoke in the casino. I was going to bed early, getting lots of rest, exercise and used the cucumbers on my eyes every day in the spa and still had red eyes.
The casino is pretty smokey and not a place I want to hang out. MGM is my least favorite place to stay over the other hotels I've stayed at. I prefer the newer tower at Caesars Palace, the Bellagio and the Palazzo and Venetian because the rooms are huge and beautiful.

Under NO circumstances should a guest stay at this hotel. To start off: the check in service was horrible with no attention to friendliness and customer service.  The check in person did not listen to our needs of getting a room in the desired location. They assigned us on the West Tower in room 5- 555 which is about one mile from the parking garage. Rude service at check out as well. The hotel room was small with cheap amenities. No microwave no fridge. The room had a funky smell of cigarettes and marijuana even though we requested a non smoking room. The escalators and some of the elevator did not work most of the days. We stayed for 5 days and the service was horrible. The grand buffet was like eating from a garbage can. The same food everyday with no attention to freshness. The lines to the buffet was about 30-40 minutes and costing $32.00 per person. They charge a mandatory $25.00 per night for no useful amenities. The gym was small and did not even have a shower. The spa was horrible. If the check in person states that they can waive the $25.00 do not listen. The hotel price was also not reasonable.

BUFFET: I liked the Cajun selection since I'm a big seafood fan but I highly disliked the fact that they didn't tell us they were going to close the buffet 30 minutes after we had entered.

I originally booked my room through a third party travel site ( don't do it!!!) and they put us in the WEST WING--- which has NO VIEW and is super compact. Also, MGM charges a $30.00\/day resort fee for slow wifi service and the pool. It adds up quickly!!! We ended up 'upgrading' for $40.00 so we could have a good view. Our upgrade included bath hooks that were falling off the walls, a shower that wouldn't drain, and writing all over the wall from kiddos. I called the front desk-- who never noted the phone call about the walls ( I just didn't want to be charged for it)! When I checked out today... No-one really cared or could confirm that I had called ... And I didn't wanna be stuck with a bill for damages. Just felt like it was a rip off. I don't mind paying for something nice ... But I want what I pay for. However, the housekeeping staff was super friendly and did a nice job!",0,0,0

Check-in was normal - but upon arriving at my room, housekeeping was still in it - and told me that they had only just started to clean it.  Subsequently, the front desk told me that the room had been marked in its inventory system as not being ready, but the agent who checked me in ignored that information and issued keys any way.

Obviously, that should not be possible.  And this is now the second time that an MGM property has pulled this stunt - last time, the Mirage did much the same thing to me, except in that case the room was actually still occupied by another guest!

We also discovered on day 3 that my spouse's key had not been re-encoded for the new room - which suggests that we may have still had access to the originally-assigned room - even though it presumably was later assigned to another guest.

This sloppiness is absolutely unacceptable.  It isn't just ""bad show"" but endangers visitors, since it suggests that keys can be issued willy-niilly.  And the fact that it's happened to me twice in a row suggests that it happens a lot.

The hotel facilities are fine, but I strongly urge anyone who values their safety not to stay at a property owned\/managed by MGM.  Unless you want to take a risk on the next intruder being someone less nice than me.",1,0,0

My girlfriend and I stayed at the MGM from a Friday to a Tuesday.  I had stayed at the MGM once or twice before, and been to Vegas many times, but this was her first trip and her birthday weekend.

We had read in reviews that if you ask for upgrades, you can usually get them.  And seeing as how this was my girlfriend's first trip and her birthday, we thought we'd have no issues.  However, to play it safe, I attempted to use myvegas credits from Facebook on a room upgrade, only to discover they had none available (so much for 6 weeks of constantly playing fake video slots).  Nevertheless, I figured we'd be able to get something. 

Unfortunately, upon arrival, we were told they had no upgrades available.  The best they could do was a strip view and a $30 beverage credit.  Firstly, our strip view room was right at the elevator, which was nice because it saved us long walks to our room, but if you know the MGM Grand Tower, that also meant that our strip view was partially obstructed by a giant green wall.  As for the $30 beverage credit - outside of beer, you can't get a drink at the MGM for less than $15.  If you want one of those large frozen drinks or the yards, which is what we got, it was more like 1.5 drinks.  So MGM did a pretty poor job of making us feel pampered or making my girlfriend's first trip and birthday something special.

That said, the reason why this was somewhat our fault was because we chose a weekend that was the grand opening of the West Republic season (their Ultra Pool party) and the grand opening of their new nightclub\/lounge\/restaurant, Hakassan.  So, they were booked, and the lack of upgrades was mostly due to that.  That said, I think they could have come up with something besides 1.5 drinks.  Maybe passes to wet republic so we wouldn't have to spend $50 to get in, or passes to Hakassan so we wouldn't have to spend $75 - and Vegas, when you're starting to charge $75 just to get into your nightclubs, you've officially stopped caring about everyone but the wealthy.

Okay, complaints aside, the MGM itself is a great place to stay.  Rooms were moderately priced and very comfortable.  The walls are paper thin, so that is a drawback.  But they are spacious and well kept.  The casino floor is huge, with plenty of games.  I was a bit surprised that on a Monday night, with lots of open tables, we couldn't find a $5 min craps table, but that wasn't the end of the world.  The pool (the main pool, not wet republic) is spacious, relaxing, and a good time.  We had problems with service at the pool - the server seemed to only come around every 15 minutes, which doesn't sound like a lot, but we asked for a drink menu and didn't get it for 15 minutes, and then when we ordered, it was another 15.  Its one thing to only circle your station every 15 minutes, but you should really bring your customers what they asked for a bit faster.

We didn't eat inside the MGM except for one morning at the breakfast buffet, which is mediocre and actually made my girlfriend sick.  There are better buffets.  That said, we didn't eat at the MGM only because we did a lot of research and found other restaurants we wanted to check out, so that isn't a knock on the MGM restaurants.  They could be awesome, we just wanted to check some of the best ones reviewed here and on tripadvisor.

So all of this said, why am I giving it 4 stars?  It looks like I have a lot of complaints.  The thing is though, when I think about my stay, we had a fantastic time.  We liked the room, we liked the casino, we liked the resort, and I would repeat the trip in a second.  So while I want to give a complete picture, in the end, the things that went wrong were really minor in the gran scheme of things.  The staff at the MGM is really friendly.  Checking in and out was easy.  It was just a tremendous amount of fun, and the issues at MGM didn't detract all that much from the experience.  Like I said above, I would like to give it 3.5, but I can't, and my experience was better than a 3.  Without these issues, it would have gotten a 5.",2,0,0

We stayed in the West Wing, which is ""hipper"" and cheaper than the standard rooms. It's smaller and better suited for couples and\/or young adults. There is a bar area on the floor (unused at the time) and in the lobby! A TV in the bathroom is both really cool and disgusting at the same time. I'll pass on the remote, thanks...

There's lots to see for both kids and adults. The pool is huge and really nice with a lazy river, lots of bridges, tents for groups, and watertoys. Sadly, it was raining the day we were there so I didn't actually get to go in. MGM wouldn't be MGM without the lions. You can walk under their glass floor and see more of their glory than you ever wanted to. 

We ate at The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar, an Asian restaurant (duh), and 'Wichcraft, the sandwich place on the corner. Though I was really surprised by the authenticity and great taste, we probably wouldn't have eaten at Grand Wok had we not been provided meal vouchers (""not without coups, baby..."" ahhaha, Dane Cook is hilarious*...). The cool folks at 'Wichcraft gave us a free cookie as a consolation for selling-out on a sandwich. Prices at both of these places aren't life-threatening. Also, Emeril has a restaurant here... and he is freaking awesome. They fly their fresh fish in via plane everyday, and you will pay the price. Rainforest Cafe is great for kids.

Check-in pissed me off. They have no formal line, so people kept cutting in front of me. If ever I felt compelled to kick an old granny in the groin, it was then. Express check-out was as easy as filling out a card (actually, it was exactly ""filling out a card""). I would gladly stay here again.

We checked out of MGM yesterday and moved to Excalibur for the remainder of our stay.  My boyfriend checked his bank account today and noticed MGM had charged him $350!!!  When he spoke with them they told him it was because there was evidence of smoking in the room.   Let me just say we don't even smoke so we were shocked that they just charge these large amounts for random reasons.  When we asked for proof of evidence they said they can't provide it.  Since they were no help over the phone we stopped our day and drove back to MGM to speak with the Manager in person.   

First the front desk employee didn't even know how the Manager was and told us there is no one by that name.  After asking another employee we were able to get the manager to come out and speak with us.  The Manager obviously didn't want to reverse the charge as he kept saying to take it up wit the bank and dispute the charge which should take a couple weeks.   I'm sorry did you realize you took $350 for no reason,  no I'm not waiting a couple weeks, we are not rich.   After repeatedly stating our point to the Manager and him reviewing the charges and ""evidence"", he ends up telling us that there is no evidence of smoking except the word of housekeeping saying it smelt like smoke.  So now you are saying you charge hotel guests for smelling like smoke.  I'm sorry but every casino you go in smells like smoke.  

We had to explain to the Manager that the rooms next to us were partying and we could smell smoke the night before, we just thought that it was our clothes or the ventilation.  He then says he thought it was odd that we were getting charged for the particular floor we were on.  He also stated that the other rooms around us had also got charged.   So first you thought the charge was odd and because the rooms around us got charged it was okay to charge random rooms next to it.   This is ridiculous.  

After telling us that you weren't able to do the refund and the bank had to do it, you come back after discussing with other Managers (hiding in the back rooms) that you are going to refund us because you feel bad.  I'm glad we were able to get that unnecessary refund but it's still going to take a couple days to reflect on the back account.   We still have a few more days in Vegas and now the money we thought we had to do shows and shop is gone for no reason.  I'm sure if we had left for home and weren't able to speak face to face we wouldn't have gotten our money back.

4 of us all pulled together and decided to splash out and stay in one of the large sky view suites, (had 2 large bedrooms, 4 HD televisions and a billiard table. An awesome room and well worth the money) I don't think we would have enjoyed our stay as much if we didn't have this haven to retreat back to.

The main issue we encountered was when we checked in. 
The man at the counter did not run through any of the expenses with us. And never had us sign any papers, which we found kind of weird as every other normal hotel does.
He told us the cost of the room and charged my friends card, but when we checked the transaction history on the card account it had actually been charged an additional $300, so we're thinking he's overcharged us without realizing. 
Also, due to the limit on the credit card, this unexpected additional cost caused an overdrawn fee on my friends account.

When we explained this to management, they did not care at all about how their staff had not communicated with us properly and how this had affected my friends funds.

Their response,

""That $300 is a bond fee for the room, it will be returned at the end if your stay and is always included in the room you booked, it was on the paper you signed""
We didn't sign ANY papers and even when booking over the phone no one told us of this. 

After again, trying to explain that if we had known this we would have then split the costs over two cards we got a blank stare and an additional ""well what do you want us to do about it"" 
In the end they offered a petty $75 voucher. We didn't want a voucher, we just wanted an apology. And not once did they apologize for the lack of service and communication.

I would have left MGM with a 5 star rating if the manager assigned to us  had actually listened to our concerns, acknowledged them and apologized.

I arrived around 1:00 ish on a Sunday....( Never Ever arrive on a Sunday, )
The line was similar to the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland on a Summer Weekend.......the line snaked back and forth in the lobby for around 1 hour. ( WHY IS THIS SO CUMBERSOME..
I BOOKED A ROOM , HERE IS MY CREDIT CARD, MOVE IT ALONG ! )

Somebody had a smart idea to hand out water and cocktails to the folks in line waiting to register. Good thinking.

Ok, I am finally registered. Head to room, walk in......the room is kind of warm. ( Maybe I have to be in the room for the air conditioning to kick in. NO. About an hour into this, I call downstairs, they said a repair person would be up, but we can not give you a time.

Two hours later, I call back, where is the repair Dude or Dudette. The voice on the phone says, "" That request has just been assigned to a person and they will be up shortly. They were up shortly. Open up the AC and huzzah, the air filter is very dirty, which makes the AC sucks poorly. It did suck poorly. New filter and 30 minutes later all good.

Head to the bathroom. No hand towels\/ No wash clothes ?
Forget it, go gamble.

The next day, I politely ask the maid for those towels. She said "" there aren't hand towels or wash clothes........I should call down to the front desk and request them. Since by her demeanor  and comments , this was more normal of an occurrence.

The prices are not cheap.

Firstly the huge line at checkin, with no help around to explain where the line actually starts. Management didn't do anything to help out. After a long wait, when we finally got to the counter, we ask for any possible good rooms or a change, which I can understand due to season won't be available readily. Then when I swipe the card for incidentals and deposits, the machine crashes, and charges me anyway. The rep asks me to swipe again and again, this after an hour long wait and a tiring 3 hour flight. Thanks for not keeping your machine updated. 
Finally when we get the key, we start towards our room which felt like forever. Rooms are small, and I guess this is because of the fact that I booked through hotels.com. The iron in the room doesn't work, when called to replace, was told will be done immediately, but I m still waiting for one. 
Next day early morning, I get knocked on the door asking when am I leaving today, and my reservation is for 3 more days, don't know how they have no idea about that?
On top of all the inconvenience, the hotel has added an extra charge of $235? Really I m in Vegas trying to balance my credit cards looking for extra charges? Thankfully they did manage to take the charge off, after me running down and standing in their checkin line, wasting my valuable vacation time. Never going here again.",3,1,1

The room was in a great location. We had a view of New York New York directly in front of us, and the mountains were very visible in the background, which made for a nice view when we woke up in the morning. 

The hotel's pool is amazing. It's like a flowing stream that goes around an island. The temperature of the water was not too cold. Walking to the pool was a little cumbersome. We had to walk through the casino to get to the pool area, which seemed a mile away. 

Another cool thing about this hotel is the lion area. It's cool walking in an area where the lions are literally above your head in a glass encasing.

Our visit started with a very, very helpful desk agent who went out of her way to make sure we were happy with our check-in experience.    There was an issue with our dining credit and she corrected it quickly with no argument.      We had a ""Hollywood"" suite on a remodelled floor.    Really nice room, so-so view as we looked out at the monorail station but we've had far worse in Vegas (and elsewhere) so no big deal.

The room was at the end of the hall so it was a bit of a walk but if you've ever stayed at a Disney hotel, you won't think this is very far at all.   

Housekeeping was great - none of the issues that others have complained about in prior reviews.

What makes MGM Grand so GRAND?!?!
Is it because the building and all it's splendor is emerald green?
Is it because the gold gigantic lion out front can be spotted a mile away?
Is it because there is some connection to the Wizard of Oz?
Is it because they hold boxing matches here? 
Is it because they are the head company that pretty much owns a couple other casinos down the Las Vegas Strip?!

I remember staying at the MGM when I was younger and had some fam bam trips to Vegas. The rooms were decent and filled with your typical amenities of a hotel room. I think the rooms are much better in quality compared to Luxor & Excalibur. When I stayed at the MGM, the Skylofts & The Signature (luxury boutique hotel rooms) were not built yet. But nonetheless, a decent stay at the regular rooms.

The food catered at the conference center was quite upscale and top notch! Consider it 100x better than what the Holiday Inn would serve you in a banquet!

Everything looked fine from the outside, but when I went to turn it on the live view screen didn't work and the view through the viewfinder was distorted. My heart sank. The interior glass components of the lens and camera were completely shattered. $3,000 in damages that I only noticed once I was at the airport headed home.

Everything else about my stay was wonderful, so I would have definitely booked my future visits here if it were not for the bag check experience. Lesson learned not to check in valuables.

We like to hop around and stay at different hotels in LV so I don't know that we'll be back necessarily, but it was a really nice casino and hotel. We went to the pool every day, not Wet Republic - we saw the kind of people walking in there and knew it wasn't for us (""ladies"" in thong bikinis with high heels, no thanks). The drinks were great and priced appropriately, good music at a good volume, clean - no complaints. We gambled everyday as well and really liked the casino - it's enormous with different minimums at different tables, so good for all budgets. Buy bottled waters at the little pastry store next to the elevators - it's like 2 for $5 and much less expensive than in the rooms or even the shops downstairs on the casino level, although I ended up needing to buy a pair of sunglasses at a shop across from the front desk and they were cute and at a decent price. Our room was on the 24th or 25th floor and at the end of the hallway, which was no big deal except I think we had a larger suite next to us on the end and they had large groups in their room until 2-3AM and were very loud. We'll just make sure we're not near a suite next time. The room was great - very clean, nicely decorated, great bathroom. Lots of dining options - we ate at a bar\/grill near the pool one day, breakfast in the food court once and a pizza place downstairs. They just opened a Top Golf there as well. We live in Dallas and have several in the area -it's so fun! This one has pools and huge screens along the back net, definitely an upgrade from other locations. The best part about this hotel though was the lady who checked us in for our stay at the front desk. I wish I could remember her name - older woman, perhaps 55-65, and had worked there for 17 years (I think that's what she said). She took quite a while explaining everything to us, giving us all sorts of information, and even found us in the lobby 10-15 minutes after we checked in to give us our M Life cards. She gave us a small refrigerator for our room at no charge, too. She started our experience at MGM on a great note and really set the tone for the weekend.",0,0,0

On the day of check in, we knew we were going to be late so we called in to let the hotel know at around 10:30. After giving our name, we let her know we were going to be late (2\/3am) and made sure it will be ok. After asking a third time she rudely told us it will be fine and hung up. We werent happy but we let it slide. 
After arriving at the hotel at about 3am, we were told our room was taken. We explained that we had called in and that someone here told us that coming in at that time didnt matter. So the hotel offered us a stay well room which is less value than the room we paid for! They even claimed at first that it was a $175 value compared to the $99 we paid! Well duh... Its more expensive the day of vs. booking and paying 2 weeks ahead! After asking she then told us that the current value of our queen was $200 and tried to rip us off! 
After asking for reinbursement of some sort she offered us two tickets to the lunch buffet.... As long as we ate it before we checked out 11am that day! The buffet starts at 10:30! How do they expect us to eat at 10:30 then go back to our room and check out by 11? She showed no sign of remorse or respect for that matter and kept saying it was our fault for coming in late. After reminding her that we did call she went back and then finally offered us a better room. She had previously told us that all the rooms were filled and checked out and all of a sudden this room is available after we complain??? All we wanted was an apology and maybe some extra hours for checkout (at that point it was 4:30am). There was no apology and she kept telling us it was our fault that someone in yhat hotel made a mistake.
FinLly we get to our room and the room was so dirty! There was dirt\/dust in the bath tub, the outlets werent working and the door would shut properly!!! I mean what an awful hotel room! The stay well suite was no different than a normal room (only thing we actually liked was the buy one get one free donut coupon at the bakery shop). Some of the lights werent even working when we turned them on!

I've given my reviews in categories...hope this helps!

Location

Location isn't so bad here considering though it's a bit a stretch away from the strip.  If you're flying into Vegas, it's awesome...whether you're renting a car or taking a cab, it's only 5 minutes away so you do save that time and money from sitting in traffic from the strip.  The monorail station allows free-flowing movement along the strip without the use of the car.

Check-In

Checking into the hotel can be a drag if you arrive at the peak hour.  I didn't have to face this issue due to being a regular--checked in through the VIP line.  

Rooms

The rooms are fairly standard.  My friends and I stayed in the standard rooms...nothing fancy but had what it needed...2 beds, bathroom, a TV, and a fridge (pre-requested).  If you're coming here to vacation with friends, you don't need a fancy room...just a place to pass out and sleep a few hours.  The hallways weren't too noisy...sure, would've loved to stay somewhere more fancy but hell, 3 days isn't much...just suck it up...

Amenities

The gaming area is large...and you can easily get lost.  The good side is that you don't need to leave the area so fast b\/c you can spend a lot of time in there and have fun without leaving the hotel.  

Pool

The pool's pretty nice here...it's large and surprisingly, it wasn't crowded when we were out...

Overall

I would stay at the MGM again.  It's a nice hotel, nothing fancy but it does have a lot to offer for the money you pay.  If it's for a few days and you could care less about sleeping and using all the fancy crap in the room, MGM is where you should book your place of stay.  Like I said, it's far from the center of the strip, but I would suggest to go to the strip for the day (play\/eat\/shop) and at night, come back and rest.",1,0,0

Finally, the 4th person took my name and number and said some one would call me back.  Well, you know how that goes...No one ever called back.  I called the Nevada Health Department to investigate.

Coffee maker in your room? Forget it.  It's a ""fire hazard"" according to the staff and therefore, not allowed anymore.  The in-room iron and hair dryer still remain, and it will cost you over $20 for a pot of coffee from room service.

The door handles in our supposed suite were broken and non-functional, and the areas behind the bedroom night stands were disgusting and had obviously never been cleaned before.  

The air conditioning would blow ice cold for an hour then switch to heat by itself and we would wake up sweating in our bed and barely able to breathe from the stifling heat.  

The automatic window shades did not work and we could not raise or lower them.

The management staff could literally care less and their attitude was basically ""take it or leave it, plenty of people who want your room so leave.""  Unbelievable.

Nothin' wrong with eating Cheetos, but it would be nice if bedding was swapped out when a new guest arrives. The bedding was wrinkled too, which made it obvious that all they did was make the bed when the last guest left, instead of putting new bedding in its place. Another indicator was that there were random hairs (that were not mine) all over the sheets. Gross.

There were several of us in town for work and every single person said their bedding was dirty, and had other cleanliness issues. Dust and grime everywhere in the room itself. One of my co-workers found a long pubic hair in his tub the day we arrived. Another co-worker went to take a shower and noticed the drain was clogged, and suddenly (WARNING: THIS IS GROSS), a big glob of semen came out of the drain and then the water suddenly flowed again.

And even though I never spilled any water, I was walking across the room one morning with socks on and suddenly my feet got wet. The carpet was soaked. Again, I didn't spill any water before. 

Obviously, I won't be staying here again.",4,1,0

So MGM spent millions change the entrance and replace the open lion mouth with a regular bronze lion statue. 

  The rooms are nicely decorated and fairly modern looking. I am minusing a star for not having a plasma.A 42 inch plasma is a requisite in my estimation. The views of the strip were outstanding.The beds are the most comfortable from all the hotel casinos I have stayed at - Venetian, Luxor, Treasure Island, Hilton and Aladdin.  I must have slept for over 7 hours and I usually do not sleep for more than 5 hrs in Vegas. The bed definitely had something to do with that. 

  MGM is one of the nicer casinos to play at and they have some of the better restaurants - Fiamma, Shibuya, NobHill, Wolfgang Puck and L'Atelier Joel Robuchon. I ate at Wolfgang Pucks bar and grill since I was not in the mood for French(L'Atelier), Italian ( Fiamma) or Japanese. But I hear they are all very good restaurants.

Let's start with check in.. we upgraded our reservation to to the SleepWell floor or experience. We were told they didn't have a room ready, but would text us in a shortly, once it was ready. We were happy with our experience and loved the fact that they could text us. We took all our luggage to breakfast at the Avenue Cafe. Our thoughts were that it was going to be a short time. The front agent spoke to them and let them know we were waiting for a room. We were given a number to call with our key packet to verify or check the status. After brunch we called and it was not ready. An hour later still not ready. Two hours later, still not ready. Almost three and a half plus hours... I lost track, multiple phone calls , the original room assigned is still not ready!!! Only then we ask if there is another room do they offer to move us to one that had been ready the entire time!!!! 

We get into our room and it's great! Relaxing and comfortable. That is until 2:45am!!! When doors start being knocked and slammed waking me up. Then from there banging starts and continues all morning off and on with slamming of the doors until around 8:30 am. So being on absolutely no sleep on the ""SleepWell"" floor is not working well for me currently!!! Then after being out all day we come into our freshly maintenances room and are immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of marijuana!!!! Not just a bit, which I get it's Vegas. No this was coming through our bathroom vents and our entire room was covered in it!!  Currently I am furious!!  I looked for a place to contact customer service online and nothing!

The pool area was definitely my favourite part of the hotel! So beautiful! They have a huge winding lazy river that was great to relax on :) 

I stayed on the west wing and the rooms are very modern with comfortable beds. 

The hotel is also in a great location - very close to many restaurants and attractions! 

My only complaint is that people could smoke indoors (but I guess that's like every hotel in Vegas?) and the extra hotel fees were kind of ridiculous when you still had to pay for tube rentals, etc.",3,0,1

For the price you pay and the few issues i come across, we will never stay here again. Here we are checking in at midnight we would think, no line for checking in. Boy were we wrong!! Not only was it long, it took over an hour to check in!! With the crazy line, no one bothered to open a few more check-in employees?! Then get to the front and after all this they tell me, I'm sorry, we no longer have a king size bed but only 2 queens. So why would you rent out rooms that you don't have? This is over 1am now and we were just tired and sleepy to argue so we just took it. I even tried to check in with the app which doesn't even work. Such a long process with tons of questions just to get no email back when my room was ready. Useless app. 

Next, she then says we now charge $10 for parking. In my mind, so what does the resort fee cover? The internet that barely works? The pool that is not opened? The fitness club that we wont be using as we are only staying practically by now less than 9hours? Does this make any sense to anyone? Anyway, so she asked if i would like to have to charged together now with the room or pay the $10 separate when we exit the lot. We charged it together which was good for 24hrs and guess what? As we exit, the ticket for parking was invalid and we had to pay again as we exit the lot. By this time, i am just so done with this. So now, i have to call the Hotel and request for a refund for one of the $10 charged twice now. If all this isn't enough, it took 4 employee reps passing me around. From ""oh good question"" then pass me to another which somehow ended me to a mandalay bay hotel rep then back which end up to wrong dpt to i am so done and yelled and this person to better not pass me around again and fix the problem. Which finally did about 25 minutes later! Guess I'm never parking here either!

Getting into the room, the rooms AC\/fridge or whatever the noise is that goes on through the night was annoying.  Ceiling above us was cracked with water\/pipe stains on it. This is what the price you pay gives you?

So from long phone call wait for room rsvp, to horrific long checkin wait time, to horrible issues that come along the way to a horrible mediocre room for the price you have to pay + resort fee + parking fee etc etc. Enough said.

 Not a bad place to hang out but to stay, no thank you.

MGM: If your going to charge for resort (which most are not used but forced to pay) + parking (even for staying guests) + more costly rooms then some other surrounding hotels, then people would expect better upgrades in some of the rooms, more employees to pick up phones without long wait times, more employees at the check in desk and train employees better so I wouldn't be passed around to someone else because they don't have the answer.",11,1,3

I checked in around 6pm and was told they had given away the Bungalow Suite I reserved (although I wonder if this is true now that I read some of the other reviews here?) and instead of offering an upgrade they decided to downgrade me instead to a standard room (and it wasn't just me, at least 2 other people had the same problem; front desk said they oversold for Valentines day...why is it so hard to only sell the amount of suites they actually have?).  To make matters worse they didn't even offer me anything to make up the difference (the suite I paid for was $20 more than a standard room), so I had to ask if I would be refunded the difference and the front desk said ""well you already have the $65 dining credit"" ....which was part of their current promo that everyone gets, whether they purchase a suite or not.  They did eventually offer to waive my resort fees and they gave me a mini fridge for free as well (which was old and came on this ugly cart, it was such an eye sore), but the fact that they didn't offer it up front shows how little they value their customers.

The room was newly renovated and I did like the decor and colors in the room; they at least attempted to make it look a bit more ""swanky"" than your average hotel decor. But when I go there was no remote for the TV, so they brought one up and that didn't work, so they brought up another one and that one didn't work either...and it turned out that the TV just didn't work at all, even though it was a brand new flat screen (the rooms were only renovated 3 weeks ago).  They said 3 other TVs had done the same that day offered to send up an engineer, but it was almost 9:00 and my show was ending anyways, so I didn't want someone in my room that late.

The second day of my stay I was set to move to the suite I paid for, they told me it would be ready between 11 and 3, which of course turned into a ""wait until 3"".  So I wait until 3, go to the front desk to get my key, they already KNOW that I've left my things in the room and will be moving them over, so what do they do?  They lock the room.  So I call security (twice) and it takes them 20ish minutes to come up and unlock the room for me so I can get my stuff out.

And there was no apology from security, or anyone else that I spoke with except the guy at the front desk when  I checked out.  In general, most of the staff I spoke with on the phone (security, operator, in room dining, etc) had bad attitudes and just sounded bored.

The suite was nice enough, it didn't have a kitchenette unfortunately, and the decor was blah (it didn't even have a flat screen tv), but at least it was spacious and came with a robe and slippers.  

Things I did like -- the easy access to the monorail and the food court.  Their rates are great too; but it's not worth the hassle.",3,0,0

When we arrived in the room, we found that the door to the bathroom was broken - no matter how it was shut, it sounded like someone was slamming to door!! We also were near some sort of dumpster area, and we were constantly woken up by the noises of them at all hours of the night.  
On our third day there, after being at a work conference all day and a work dinner all evening, we headed back to our room around 12:30 am to find our room keys were not working (again - this had happened 2x before and we had to have them re-keyed).  When we went to the front desk, we were informed our room was changed and that the manager had checked us out of our room.  Our belongings were still in this room, and we were very tired and frustrated.  We were told the room was no longer available because there would be ""drilling"" on that floor happening at 6:00 am that morning.  After much back and forth with the manager, we were given an ""access key"" that would work only one time to get our belongings so we could move to the opposite tower.  At this point, it was 1:30 am and we were exhausted.  We decided to sleep in the room that night and risk the morning sounds of the drilling; we decided we would get up the next morning and change rooms at that time.  There was no drilling.  When we changed rooms, we called the Bell Hop who was extremely helpful.  She gathered our things and escorted us to our new room.  When she used our keys to open the door, there was someone in the room!! We had been assigned an occupied room - thank goodness we did not barge in at 1:30 in the morning, it would have been very rude to the man in the room.  The Bell Hop then called down to the front desk and had to get us another room at this point which was now on another floor.  About 30-45 minutes later we finally were checked into our new room.  What is frustrating, is how we had to be uprooted from our room, which took a total of about 3 hours (finding out this information, gathering our belongings, going to the next room, getting assigned a third room, and finally getting into the room and getting unpacked again).  It was a terrible stay, and the customer service was terrible from everyone except the Bell Hop - she was amazing!

First, the spectacle that is Wet Republic is worth the trip. Eye candy central with lots of craziness. $17.50 for a mid-grade 6 oz call-cocktail and near $100 buckets of Bud Light left me feeling REALLY violated. The security staff and entry routine at Wet Republic is absolutely rediculous. I think MGM grand rounded up every mall cop reject with a petty power trip they could find. Two gates + a VERY aggressive frisk and bag check routine left me pretty sour on the place from the start. I've had much better treatment from TSA officers, much more often. Optimism prevailed and a decent time was had. I'm an urban professional in my mid-40's (i.e. not a suspicious looking person). Yet, this tone within the security department was felt in most places throughout the property. The security people at the MGM just need some additional interpersonal training.

You exit the elevator and go down the hallway, beautiful patterned carpet, textured walls, art on the walls, attractive light fixtures...then you reach the West Wing, or as my boyfriend called it ""crossing the train tracks"". The carpet changes patterns, as well as cleanliness. It was very dirty. Stained & old. Plain walls, overhead lighting only, and grey. Welcome to the West Wing Clinic. Once you enter the room, the bathroom is immediately on your right. The floor of the shower is cement. Painted cement. i was shocked. The tv cabinet\/dresser had large chunks taken out of it, I assume from previous guests. The headboard was so faded i thought it was a pattern, it wasnt. The shade had multiple holes in it and was stained.

A little four year old was lost around my slot machine crying at 2:30 am. Finally his idiot mother found him and guess what, she started yelling at HIM. I could not believe it. Where is casino security?!! 

The other turn off are the number of women parading around the casino in their bathing suits drunk around all these ""little kids"". I witnessed one of these drunks literally messing with one of the ""little kids"" behind her and her parent's back. One of her huge nasty butt cheeks was hanging out. She was barefoot, staggering and spilling her drink everywhere. Two...yes two MGM security guys walked by her, one of them actually turned around to check out her butt. 

I am not a prude, and I understand that is a long hall to the pools from anyone's hotel room. But I think that the other guests in the hotel are allowed a certain amount of respect. It seems like the MGM is attracting a much lower class of people. Geez!",1,1,0

Book it! 

I read a few reviews about the MGM and just decided to try it since it is the biggest resort in Vegas. I don't mind the walking and all that since I'm not that old. 

The checkin process was pretty annoying since there were only 5 agents open. They had at least 10 stalls available. Anyways, it was pretty painless once we were helped. We asked for an upgrade, but since we requested smoking rooms, there were only 2 floor that they could put us on. No problem.

We got a room on the 24th floor if I remember correctly. And yes, there was Indo smoke filling the hallways. Damn it smelled good!

The rooms are typical for Vegas. Very clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated. I'm not one to take pictures of every nook and cranny and scratch so I was very satisfied.

The green monstrosity on the strip that seems like it's been there for ages has spruced up their little West Wing and I for one, am a fan.

Parking: $12\/day to park?! I am already paying a lot to stay at the hotel not to mention ill be charged a lot in resort fees on top of everything, and now i have to also pay to park? That was extremely frustrating.

Arrival: we checked in using he mobile check in app and were able to walk right up and get our room keys! It was a great start to our stay at the MGM. We took our time to get to our room because we were taking in all of the beautiful sights and sounds. 

Our first room: first impression, ""what is that smell?"" The room certainly had a smell but we pressed on and explored the room. At first glance it's a very cool looking room, a bit small but cool. When I started to pay closer attention I noticed a horribly chipped sink, broken outlets, a non functioning window shade, and a broken door lock.... we tried to stay optimistic and not let those little things ruin our trip, but what is that smell?!  We decided to explore the hotel and have some fun and upon our return the smell had completely consumed the room. It smelled like a dead animal in the ventilation. (No I am not kidding). We called the front desk and they sent a man up who seriously sprayed our floor with some mystery solution and left. It did a great job of temporarily masking what we are now almost certain was a dead mouse somewhere... I finally decided to speak to someone at the front desk and they were AMAZING! i wish i would have gotten his name. He was very apologetic and switched our room immediately. He even upgraded us for the inconvenience for free! We couldn't wait to get out that smelly room. 

Room # 2: Are we in the same Hotel?! WOW! We literally felt that way. From the elevators, the carpet, the staff, and the room were literally night and day. It seriously felt like we had switched to a different, more luxurious hotel. Our new room was BEAUTIFUL! Working locks, twice the space, an amazing view of the mountains! We were so thrilled about our new room. It gave us the ability to not worry about our room and enjoy everything else! I cant express how grateful i am for them being so helpful! 

The Casino: If you've been to one vegas casino you've been to them all. We walked through almost every single casino on the strip and i cannot picture a single discernible difference from one to the next. They are all smoky, loud and have lots of slots and tables. MGM Grand was no different. 

The Food: We thoroughly enjoyed every single dining experience we had at the MGM Grand! Sit down, fast food, late night, buffet, breakfast, etc! They had it all!! We did not have a single meal that wasn't absolutely delicious. The prices of course are high, but they were mostly competitive compared to other Casinos and very convenient for us as MGM Grand Guests. There is literally something for everyone. I was very impressed by their food selections.

Top Golf: We had never been to a Top gold previously but were with a group that had. We had an absolute blast! The two hours went by very fast and our entire party seemed to really enjoy themselves. The food and Drink prices were outrageous so please be mindful of that. 

Final Thoughts: What had started off as a very disappointing stay, ended up being a very fulfilling experience.This hotel had everything imaginable. We could have just as easily stayed anywhere else and experienced the MGM Grand as visitors but we were glad we stayed there to see how it was. When we ultimately Return to LV we will most likely not be staying at the MGM grand as there are so many other places to try. Plus there are several Hotels and Condos that don't charge for parking and also exclude Resort Fees which can save you 100s of $$. 

My Personal Recommendation: A group of my friends Stayed at a Condominium basically on the strip. They had twice the room space, lots of amenities, and free valet parking. They were still able to experience everything We did but without all of the costly fees. You don't have to stay at a casino to enjoy them.",1,0,1

When I called the police and security to press charges on the girl who assaulted me they thought the right thing to do was to kick the both of us out of the hotel. I have never been so miss treated by a hotel I spent thousands of dollars in. When I asked the security why was I being kicked out and why they did not go over the cameras there answer to me was that they didn't care it's not there problem. As me and the other guest who I was sharing a room with gathered our stuff ft he security guards were saying very awful things to us such as get the f*** out, Go F*** your mother.

Accessing the front of the hotel, where the main valet is located, was a mission. We finally learned that you need to enter from Tropicana, by staying right before getting to Las Vegas Blvd.

The hotel rooms have been newly renovated, but I still wasn't a big fan. The mattresses could have been better, but overall the room is fine. I think I have just been spoiled by hotels like Venetian, which are much better, but much more expensive. The rates at MGM are reasonable and you get what you pay for, maybe even more than what you pay for here.

The hotel and casino are very large, so it takes some navigating to figure it all out, but once you do, it's not bad. 

The food court has a McDonalds which was cool, but the Big Mac did not taste the same as the McDonalds that I have had in LA.

My brother wanted to go to Vegas this weekend for his birthday, so I made it happen.  Called Casino Marketing to book a room. Got a great rate.. So that was the easy part. 


Parking:

Parking is not too bad, but just know that you have to go to the street level (from where ever you park) and then take the escalator up to the main level (where check -in and all of the other action is)

Check-In: (arrival 11:30pm, lines and wait were not that long)

I have stayed here about  a hundred times (I come to Vegas often) and by far, this was the worse check-in service. The guy barely said hello and welcomed us to the resort. He took my ID, CC and Players Card, left it on the desk and walked away for 10 minutes and went to the back room. No ""I'll be right back, one moment please or anything.""

When he get's back, the clerk looks at my players card (see's that I'm a gold member) and then gives better service. Apologizes for the delay.. Says there was a ""system error"" and then proceeds with the rest of my check-in. There was no interaction nor eye contact. (I still have to call my\/a Casino Host about this)

The only thing I felt good about was the room that he assigned to us. Double beds, high floor and a prime view of the strip. 


Room:

MGM's tower deluxe rooms are simple but yet comfortable at the same time. Comfortable beds, great pressure on the showerhead, approx 450 square feet, comes with a 27 inch tv (which they are in the process of upgrading from what I hear), business desk and a lounge chair. One cool feature about their rooms is that there is a ledge that you can sit and stare off into the strip while enjoying a drink of your choice. 


Pools:

Amazing!! And tons of them! A lazy river, few Olympic sized pools and Wet Republic for the Adults.


Casino:

The Casino is huge. Any game you want they pretty much have. For us Baccarat players, they took Baccarat off of the floor about a year or so ago and made all Baccarat play get played from the Salon.  :) 

Tons of Blackjack tables with all different minimums and millions of slot machines. 

The sportsbook was pretty cool too. Just one of the smaller sportsbooks that I have been to.


Bars\/Lounge Areas:

When we rolled up to the strip we started calling hotels to get a room. The mgm sounded great because it was right on the strip and only $65\/night in the middle of the week. So we valeted the car got our stuff and strolled up to the checkin desk. We asked for the BEST room they had available because we were only staying one night and we wanted to go big! The woman at the desk said if we wanted a room we would have to pay for last night and tonight because it was 3am. we were so exhausted we agreed. she also informed us that we would be charged a $40 resort fee. So we were like okay fine!
 
When we got to our room it was a normal room with 2 queen beds on the 5th floor... HAHA that was the best? nooo! so we went back to the desk. We were already a little frustrated. Then on top of that there was absolutely no one in line and we stood there for 10 mins to get the front desk attendants attention was annoying! We finally got into a more desirable room on the 28th floor over looking the strip. 

After a few hours of sleep we woke up ready to go! As everyone knows its way more fun to pregame to music so we called the front desk for ipod speakers.  They told us it would be $110 to RENT a iHome for 24hours! What a joke! Ive stayed plenty of places on the strip and its always complementary especially if you pay a resort fee!! Mmmmokay so we passed on the iHome. Soon after we realized there was no mini fridge in the room. So we called the front again asking why our room didnt have one.Apparently our room hadn't been remodeled yet. OF FREAKING COURSE NOT! we only asked for the best room right?  So we asked them to bring a mini fridge to our room.
 
ME:          ""alllllllright.. thats a going to be an additional $30 to rent a mini fridge. So your telling me the fridge is less then the iHome""
MGM:      ""...yes.""
ME:          ""mmmh ok!? and your telling me all the other rooms that are up to date get a fridge complementary and we need to pay for one""
MGM:       ""...yes.""

We had a wonderful stay at the MGM for my bosses bachelorette party and since we were on a little vacation a few girls treated ourselves to a day of pampering at the Grand Spa. The spa is like a place of its own located in the lower level of the hotel. Note that the massage prices are high, but they are definitely worth it. After checking in, you're shown the dressing room and given bath robes to change into. Then off to the relaxation room where you await your masseuse and hour and a half of pure bliss. Their spa facilities include spacious steam rooms, saunas, whirlpools and of course the relaxation lounge. My massage was wonderful and my messause made sure to focus on my lower back which has always been a problematic area for me. After all of our massages, the rest of the girls and I met back up and  relaxed in the whirlpools for a bit and had some snacks that were available to us. In the locker room, I noticed they had some pretty cool amenities for their patrons such as perfumes, hairsprays, and disposable toothbrushes made with ready to use toothpaste. We were at the spa for a good 3 full hours and it was such a relaxing experience. I wished we could have stayed the entire day!",0,0,0

When you come to places like this you expect top notch service, and it was just a rinky dink room for me. I stayed here January 2 to the 4th this year so it was a little busy but we were accommodated very smoothly at customer service and in room service. My disappointment comes with the room itself, (king standard) room 4-525. The cable did not work in our room, we could not get a hold of front desk for hours so just said forget it. Our room in particular faced a wall, so if you are particular about where you want to be placed then be sure to ask for something that has a view of the strip. In addition, this room was just a bed and TV, no refrigerator or any other amenities that you would expect. Then we get charged a resort fee which seemed like a rip off because nothing was accessible the pool and all outdoor areas were closed for the year. Maybe it was my lack of reading the terms or just not willing to pay an arm and leg for better rooms but I have been at lower hotels with way more amenities than that. Any how, the term you get what you pay for is very accurate in this case. Ask a lot of questions prior to booking for a more preferred experience.",1,0,0

So, I figured MGM would be a decent choice. I have always heard mixed reviews, but most people agree that it's at least a ""party hotel"". Knowing this, I booked a room for me and a few friends, so we could enjoy a fun weekend. 

The reservation got off to a rocky start. We had booked via ""Hotels.com"", but I guess this was a mistake. We had called a week before to confirm our reservations (2 rooms next to each other), and they person on the phone confirmed our request. However; when we got there they seemed to have no idea what we were talking about. We got to the hotel a little early, and asked if we could have early check-in. Confused, our clerk agreed. He told us to come back in about an hour to check-in officially. So, we checked out bags and returned an hour later. Between the time we asked for early check-in, and when we came back to the front desk they ""lost"" our reservation. They checked us into complete different rooms, on different floors. And didn't activate our cards. We had to stand in line a second time (hour long wait), just to have them activate the cards correctly. Thank goodness they took our ""early check in fee"" off, since it was almost ""check in"" time by the time we officially got to our rooms. Having such a difficult time to check in really didn't help our ""party vibe"". 

Once we got to the suites, we found them to be pretty blah. Nothing special, nothing fancy, just a boring room. Being that we came to party, and have fun, it wasn't really a big deal. But, don't expect you'll get the elaborate lifestyle at this place! Just a boring, average, hotel..no real ""Vegas"" feel. 

The reason I am giving the MGM 2 stars, rather then one, is based on the pool only. There were enough pools to make it not super packed, and the lazy river is pretty cool. Again, don't expect to ""lounge"" by the pool, this is a party hotel! Lots of drunks, and loud partying, but for what we were going for, I had a great time! The pool is a bit of a walk from the hotel rooms, and you have to walk through the casino and a few restaurants to get there, so that can be a bit awkward. 

The casino is meh. Same slots and games as every other hotel on the strip, with the same costs, but fewer waitresses. I sat by a slot machine for 45 mins, and the waitress only came by one time. My husband played craps for over an hour, and never saw a waitress. You would think the waitress would at least serve the table games, if nothing else? Based on the casino alone, this place is only a 1 star. The games aren't cheap enough to have no waitstaff. Might as well go across the street to play. 

Overall, I didn't have a terrible time, but I will not stay here again. There is nothing that makes it stand out above other hotels. Rooms are average, casino is average, service is poor. The pools are great, but it doesn't make up for every other aspect. With so many other great hotels on the strip, this one isn't cheap enough to justify paying the same (if not more expensive) price as other places.",3,0,0

Overpriced (even for Vegas) - barebones room with no mini bar, no drinking water in the room, no coffee maker, and just two pillows (all these things usually come with a high end hotel). Our room had one tiny window, low ceilings, and was very dusty (dust was flying around in the bathroom and I couldn't even get my contacts on without getting dust in my lens). Our light was malfunctioning and wouldn't go off. The heating or air conditioning system is super loud, and not in a cute white noise way. The electronics are outdated. If you try and order water, you'll have to buy it and pay a delivery fee (so $10 water!!). Even though we were staying for just one night, house keeping came by at 8am (I don't know for what) waking us up. I called to give my feedback to guest services and they said that they were busy and so the price and service is to be expected. I really can't believe this is considered a 4 star hotel.

There are probably some decent things about this hotel, but I didn't notice them because I was so furious at the amount that I paid and the value and service that we received. I understand that it was a busy time for the hotel, but then hire some more staff or at least provide complimentary water for surge pricing. We had just stayed at the Cromwell the night before which was similar price, but infinitely better service and rooms, so the contrast was particularly appalling.

I booked a ""New Grand King"" room through Hotels.com. The room at first glance was beautiful. It was a recently re-modeled room, complete with a bright (and huge) vanity-style bathroom mirror (any gal's dream), a huge bed, and a big window with a city view. I loved it.... until of course I noticed (what I assumed was) urine stains all over the toilet, and (what I'm sure was) facial hair sprinkled all over the sink. Yay. If that's not sure to turn a smile into a frown then I don't know what is.

Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. I wasn't particulary fond of the bed pillows, but my boyfriend thought our bed was very comfortable. We didn't have any other problems with the room, and the service at the MGM Grand was excellent.

A word of advice: don't go to the MGM Grand buffet unless you like being disappointed. It was terrible. On the bright side, there is a small fourt court inside the Casino (with a 24 hr Mcdonald's for all of you late-night drunkies), in addition to Starbucks and a few other cafes and restaurants.

**WHEN CHECKING OUT: Don't wait in the insanely long line in the lobby. Use your room phone to call Guest Services and check-out that way (that's what we did, and it was a breeze). You can also check-out using your television.**

Marble floors and counters, a Jacuzzi tub, everything was great. My boyfriend and I had such a great time exploring and getting to know the area during our stay at the MGM.

As for the MGM itself, it's a convenient location from New York, New York. I also loved how active the hotel was during all times of the day.

I once came out to Las Vegas with my sister her husband and my friend (we used to be in the same cosmo school) she has two children and works and goes to school and I have two jobs and go to school; BACK TO THE STORY: we were in love with room service and our beds lmfao.

MOVING ALONG!!

When I tell you my sister and brother in law kept blowing up our phones to come and gamble and have fun, we were so tired from the long day that morning and noon with a fat Tuesday (if you haven't had one don't lmfao they will put you to bed) that we went to bed at like 6pm NO LIE and didn't wake up till the next day like ""Dam that was some good a** sleep!""

MY POINT IS....

Even if it' s just to relax and sleep MGM is the place I am telling y'all LOL!!! 
Everyone made fun of us ""Who comes to Las Vegas to sleep"" apparently I do because I barely rest when I am home so leave me alone lol.

I used the valet parking for part of my stay, but MGM charged me for valet parking for ALL nights of my stay. This is their POLICY. MGM's customer service representative told me that once you use the valet parking once, they ASSUME you use it for the other nights. Without actually verifying. That's not what the valet parking told me, and I specifically told them when I was stopping using valet parking.

I'm speechless.

1. I couldn't connect to the wifi in my room. I had to call their tech support four times. When I urgently needed to work (I was on a business trip), I couldn't get online for hours. Several times they had to manually add my computer to their network. When I still couldn't access the internet, I was told they were sending someone to my room to troubleshoot in person. 45 minutes later, I get a call to my room saying they are not allowed to service my computer in person and I have to call back the same tech support line I've been talking to. Fortunately I got online but only hours after I was supposed to. Although I may have been the exceptional personal who had persistent issues - it created major headaches for me.

We arrived at night and there was a line to check in but it went by pretty quickly. They gave us a room in the grand wing and we got a high floor.. We didnt get a good view the only thing we could see was the roof of a bulding but we didnt really mind since we weren't going to spend much time in the room. The room was pretty big, very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is HUGE and the hallways are REALLY long! so make sure you wear comfortable shoes.. there are plenty of restaurants to choose from and if you dont want to spend much on food there are inexpensive restaurants at the food court.. we also spent a day at the pool and it took us a while to find a spot so if your going during the summer make sure you go early because it gets really packed! everyone at the hotel is very nice and friendly.. i read other reviews about people complaining about the smell of smoke in the casino but i didnt really notice it.. another complain i read was about the west wing that the hallway is really dark.. i didnt stay or get a chance to pass by so im not sure about that.. overall i enjoyed staying at the mgm and will definitely recomend it to others..i will be leaving tomorrow 04\/10\/2015 to vegas and will be staying at the mgm again.. hopefully i have the same experience i had last time i visited.. i will be updating my review once i get back :)",0,0,0

I was underwhelmed by the hotel aspect of MGM Grand. I feel that the price was excessive, especially considering the ""resort fee"" which is just a way for them to advertise a lower price than you'll actually pay. Broken shower controls meant I was taking lukewarm showers my entire trip and the video checkout didn't work. Relatively minor inconveniences seem a lot worse when you consider how much you pay for them. Especially since I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas that are cheaper and nicer. 

Casino: 
The best thing about the MGM Grand Casino is they have a quarter-operated mechanical horse racing game that's one of the last few in existence. Even the ""old vegas"" casinos have largely phased out anything mechanical in favor of computer chips that require a lot less maintenance (and sadly it seems like many are also trying to replace real live dealers with computers as well, but that's a different story). Playing this mechanical horsie game is a lot of fun, and a treat since you know you may be one of the last people to ever play it. 

Craps is my game, but I found the craps dealers to be somewhat brusque and not nearly as much fun as the dealers I've encountered downtown at The Four Queens or Fitzgeralds. My friend was repeatedly admonished for the way he put his chips down, I incurred the wrath of a dealer for taking an extra second before shooting to make sure everyone had their bets in. Overall the atmosphere was much less fun than what I'm used to. Tipping the dealers did not seem to improve their mood. 

Other: 
We didn't really eat, drink, or do anything else at the MGM. 

Overall: 
I have more fun staying and playing downtown than I do on the strip. While MGM is probably a great place for lots of folks, it really isn't my type of place. And yeah, the lukewarm shower thing still bugs me.",1,0,0

I've stayed here over the years, and the one thing that keeps me coming back is the constant renovations and the consistent prices. I've never overpaid here, even when I visit during busy weekends (relative to other hotels-- gouging is inevitable during fights, conventions, etc.)

The rooms are nicely maintained, but if you want a real treat, pay a little more and get a room in the West Wing. Classier, swankier, and WAY cooler. Impress your friends, or a stranger. Oh wait.

ANYWAY, the MGM Grand Garden Arena is by far my favorite venue in Las Vegas. It's easy to access, and easy to exit. 

Parking at this hotel isn't SO bad. Valet or self. 

Plenty of show options. A plethora of dining options. I'm not a huge fan of the nightlife here, but you can always catch a cab, and head out to Tao, XS or Moon. No big deal.

It was definitely enough time to see Vegas, and some of our group left on Monday or Tuesday due to their schedules and they had a great time in those few days! I had never been to Las Vegas before so I have no other Vegas experiences to compare it to, but it was amazing! I cannot wait to go back. My husband and I went to Vegas for his birthday celebration and I had been planning our trip for months. We heard great things about the MGM and decided it would be a great place for our entire group to stay (we had about 15 family members and friends flying in from all over the country). My parents stayed even longer than we did and they rented a car for the week, which was great. We took it to go off the strip for dinner a couple times and to visit Fremont Street (not the best place, I went during the day but heard it's more fun at night). There is also a Haufbrau (spelling?) House, a German beer\/food place off the strip that my husband enjoyed going to! Here are the pros and cons of the MGM:

Pros:
*Lots of restaurants - we went to Rainforest Cafe, The Pub, McDonalds, the place next to McDonalds that had Krispy Kreme donuts (yum), the pizza place in the basement, the crepe place (delicious), and Diego.
*Great location - south end of the strip but not all the way down the strip, still close to NYNY, Walgreens, etc.
*Close to the airport
*Check in at the airport is available to skip the lines at hotel
*Huge hotel, tons to do!
*Good breakfast buffet, I went one time
*Convenience store by elevators, has everything you need!
*Elevators are fast (we used the ones behind a set of glass doors, go past the elevators in your wing on the ground level, they are even quicker and no lines!)
*Pools are amazing!! 5 pools total, lazy river, and outdoor pool club
*Clean rooms
*Blackout shade in your room! Woo hoo!
*Nice amenities in the room and bathroom
*Huge casino
*Cirque de Soilel show (Ka) that we has tickets to was right in the hotel, which was great!
*Monorail is accessible from inside the hotel, which was awesome

Cons:
*I was not treated nicely at Wet Republic (staff was incredibly rude to me)
*There is practically no shade at the pools, get there super early if you want shade!
*Lazy river was full of drunks, it was a little off-putting and felt like a cheap spring break in college
*You have to walk A LOT! Huge hotel.
*Long line to check out of hotel (we opted for the express check out)
*Valet parking took over 35 minutes to get our car on the day we were leaving for the airport. We had called ahead, too, but it still took that long! That was unusual compared to the rest of the week, but it happened on the worst possible day when we needed the car!
*Wi fi is horrible at the hotel
*TV in two of our friends' rooms stopped working numerous times
*The rooms smell pretty bad, not sure why
*Sometimes the room had not been cleaned by the afternoon hours, but it is a big hotel so that is understandable

Two tips: Do not move anything in the mini fridge, they come to check daily to see if you opened something. Luckily they did not charge us even though we were curious about all of the items!

If you are traveling with four people and staying in one room, only book the room under two names instead of four. You can ask for four room keys and then you solve the problem of getting everyone into the pool (everyone needs a key), while also saving money on the daily hotel charges for each person. I am not saying that we did this.... Just a tip.",5,0,0

We went during slow season, so I thought that the staff would have seen and accomodated my request for a view of the strip- nope. The room and bathroom were simply outdated. The bed was comfortable, but that's about it. It wasn't ugly, but you just don't get what you pay for. Oh well, we spent most of our time outside of the room anyway. I could have just stayed at Tropicana and saved a lot of money though...

Check out Shibuya restaurant while you're at the MGM, it was delicious and the service was excellent. Start with the Lobster miso soup.. but avoid buying their bottled water at all costs!! $8!!! x_x $8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A nice shopping complex is here, but doesn't compare to the Caesars Forum and the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  Your hotel room, all towers are a million miles from the casino.  It's a shorter walk to California than it is to your room.  The large lobby is impersonal and crowded always moving slowly.  The car valet is among the slowest in Vegas.  The casino rewards programs, linked to many great Vegas casinos doesn't seem to reward you.  It's just like their slot machines; they think your money.

We arrived in Vegas super early (don't ask) and waited until after 4p for an open room. We booked the Prima package, which has since changed pretty drastically, but at the time the package included a free room upgrade. Sadly, there were no rooms to upgrade us to, so we received a $50 credit. We stayed in the West Wing and the room was very small (smaller than Luxor and the Hilton). Fortunately, there weren't any noise issues other than random drunks in the hall, but be prepared to feel slightly claustrophobic at first. The bathroom was also small and there was very little primping space. Very modern feel to the room, but not great. 

We checked out KA and Crazy Horse Paris, receiving a discount on KA since we were staying at the MGM. Both were great shows (Crazy Horse was a little slow in some parts, but at least there were boobies to stare at.) One great thing about the MGM is that there is a discount ticket booth almost directly outside, which is how we saw Crazy Horse for half price. 

The Prima package was a great deal at the time because we received 2-for-1 drinks at four of the bars, saving us a great deal of cash to spend on the slots :) They also offered several deals for the restaurants (2-for-1 entrees) but we actually never ate at any aside from the buffet, which was NOT part of the deal and which I would NOT recommend. The seafood was NOT fresh. 

The Prima deal is no longer the awesomeness that it was, so I really see no reason to go back to the MGM to stay when you can get a larger, nicer room for the same or better price elsewhere on the strip.

I do love the Lion Exhibit, though.",1,0,1

Room: I booked a Grand King Room but got hooked up with a great view of the strip in the Grand Tower wing! The room was nice and clean. Their front desk was excellent in answering their phone, I only had to wait between 30 sec. - 1 min. every time.  

Hakkasan nightclub (Sunday): I came to see Tiesto on a Sunday\/Industry Night. It's an awesome club, it fits MGM look and feel very well. I was able to enter the club around 11pm by having a presale ticket you buy offline. Tiesto went on at 1am and the dance floor was packed! There were many tables surrounding the dance floor. I believe they should limit a number of people in the dance floor, it was crazy, but it was awesome when Tiesto went on... 3 hour set!

Traveling from MGM to other hotels?
MGM has a Deuce bus stop right outside their front doors, and a tram in the back of the hotel. The Deuce bus travels along Las Vegas Blvd. all the way to Downtown Las Vegas. The Tram goes to Las Vegas Hilton, I believe. The Deuce is $8 for 24 hours (great!). Tram is $5 a single ride and $12 for the day. The upside about the tram is that there is no traffic as it's elevated in it's own lane. If you take the Deuce, you may have to deal with the Blvd's traffic.",7,1,1

Als ich 1994 in Las Vegas war, hatte das Hotel erst im Dezember 1993 eröffnet und war damals das Highlight am Strip.

Das Markenzeichen und Stilelement ist natürlich der brüllende Löwe und bis ins Jahre 1997 betrat man das Hotel und Casino durch einen Löwenkopf. Im asiatischen Raum sieht man den Löwen eher als Unglücksbringer, so dass man den Eingangsbereich nochmals extra umgestaltet hat.

Das luxuriöse Hotel lässt keine Wünsche offen. So gibt es beispielsweise eine riesige tropische Poollandschaft mit vier Pools, dem künstlichen Fluss Backlot River, Brücken, Fontänen und Wasserfälle. Darüber hinaus gibt es die Einkaufspromenade Studio Walk mit 10.700 m² und die Star Lane mit kleineren Shops.

Bekannt ist das Hotel aufgrund der gigantisch großen MGM Grand Garden Arena mit über 17.000 Sitzplätzen. Hier finden auch immer wieder größere Veranstaltungen und Boxkämpfe statt. Für den Hollywoodstreifen Ocean's Eleven diente das Hotel zeitweise als Filmkulisse.

Das Casino ist mit seinen 16.000 m² gigantisch groß und verfügt über 165 Spieltische, wie Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Craps, Let It Ride, Baccarat, Keno, Sportsbook, Slots, Videopoker, Videokeno. Für die reicheren Besucher gibt es einenPlayers Club, den sogenannten ""M life Players Club"".

I like the pool area as they have a number of pools. It was never super difficult to find 5 chairs together. Both pool days, we ended up at the Producer's pool. We typically got to the pool around 9-10am.

Altogether, for 3 nights with resort fees and tax, we ended up paying a little under $600. Not bad for three nights which included a Friday night.

I've stayed at worst properties than MGM (remember Imperial Palace?) and better properties (I won't name the hotel, but it's the roommate's choice). MGM is kind of in the middle. I guess that means it's A-OK.",7,6,10

Foodwise, is outstanding.
Wolfgang Puck, 2 Tom Colicchio, a Michael Mina, Emeril, and more.

There is decently priced gambling here, especially at off hours.
Nothing below $5 really.
Craps is usually $10.

I've stayed here a few times...
West Wing, which we really liked! I think it is being renovated right now though...
Recently stayed in a renovated King, which was really nice.
My only complaint about the bathroom, is there needs to be a second light switch for the bathroom. When you try to quietly go pee at 4am, and not wake up your friend, its hard when a blast of light comes out of the bathroom.

I've had packages delivered to their business center, which is right beside the lobby desks, which worked flawlessly. Make sure to put your name, and reservation number, and they can deliver it to the room.

Hooker watching is hilariously fun here...

The monorail is also an easy way to get around, especially if you want to get around the crowds. It is air conditioned too. Definitely key.

Wifi is worked into your resort fee. It is spotty, but works when you need to quickly look at something.",3,0,1

I can't comment on regular room pricing as I booked a package deal through Expedia that made my stay extremely reasonable.  This was especially true considering the quality of accommodations as well as the amazing location and activities. Like any other hotel on the Strip, MGM Grand does have resort fees to the tune of about $35 a day. These aren't exactly fun to pay, but to me and my friend it was worth it to stay in the middle of the action rather than off-Strip.

Check-in and check-out took all of 10 minutes total, and every employee we interacted with was very pleasant. We even got a complimentary upgrade to a slightly bigger room with two queen beds. I'm not exactly sure why - maybe the desk clerk was just in a good mood?! The room was decently sized and very clean. It seemed new and modern, almost like it had been renovated recently. The bathroom was larger than most. Wifi was free and pretty fast.

You could realistically not leave the MGM and still have enough to do during a few days in Vegas! There's so much going on. You have Hakkasan (the nightclub and the restaurant), shows including Jabbawockeez, Ka, & David Copperfield, Brad Garrett's Comedy Club, the Wet Republic pool\/dayclub, five other regular pools, a spa, and a gym. There might even be more that I forgot to list. 

There are also many other shops and restaurants just off the lobby outside of the casino. My friend and I liked the food court because it had fairly reasonably priced food, at least for Vegas. You can get lunch or dinner for around $10 per person, and while that's not the cheapest food in the world, it's some of the cheapest you're going to find anywhere near the Strip. (Hint: try to find a tray with a paper placemat thingy on it before you order. They have buy one meal, get one 50% off coupons printed on them!) And let's not forget Fat Tuesday, the infamous daquiri bar with those plastic cups the size of a toddler that you see everyone walking around with. (Another hint: get some Jello shots or slushies and have them before you go to the pool parties on the weekend so that you don't have to pay $30 for one drink! You'll thank me later.)

I deducted one star because the walls are wafer thin. You can hear exactly what's going on in the rooms above and beside you. When someone is out in the hall talking, it sounds as if they are standing right next to your bed, which is obviously very inconvenient and frustrating when you're trying to get a good night's sleep. Further evidence that these walls are the equivalent of issue paper? There were a few times where my friend and I heard someone using their room key to enter a nearby room, and we could hear what was going on so well that it sounded like they were trying to come into our room, which was a bit scary.

To sum it up, I would stay here again because the location is so great and my overall experience with the room and amenities was satisfying. I just plan to bring earplugs next time so that I don't get woken up every time someone has a conversation anywhere near my room.",6,0,0

2nd room- The view got better, although you could still see the view of roof tops at least I could see that seattle thingy and some other gold building. The windows were cool I liked playing with the shades. The air conditioning was NOT COOL! We're in LV we need the air condition to work!!! The room was SO HOT! and standing in the hallway would've been a lot more refreshing! This second room was a lot easier for us to get to! it was closer to the elevator~ yay!

POOL- THE POOL WAS SO FREAKING FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got to say walking there before you went to the pool wasn't as embarrassing as walking back from the pool! Not only the walk was long! Can you imagine walking all wet? AND they didn't let you take the towel back with you to cover you up! Lucky I brought my own towel. So if you do go to the pool keep in mind that your going to go through the walk of shame and embarrassment! Bring a T-shirt or Towel of your OWN! to the pool. The pool was VERY packed! and it was super hot! They had 4 different pools and sadly I went around 5ish and they closed the other 2 pools ): So I didn't get to see how those were.

One word describes the MGM: GRAND. It's name literally is the perfect description to understand this place. 

The initial check in area\/lobby is enormous. There were many employees at the front desk and we were checked in within 15 minutes. We did encounter a small issue when requesting our rooms; we reserved our room online for a king bed in the grand tower, turns out we supposedly reserved a room with two queens. This was sort of bothersome as what we reserved is what we really wanted, but apparently no single king rooms were available so we were placed in the West Wing, somewhat of a false advertising thing as all the grand tower rooms I saw mostly had two queens. In reality, our west wing room was really cool with a nice, large bed with dimly lit lighting. It came with a standard TV and DVD player, ample closet space and a sleek bathroom at the entry. Be wary; if your trying to stay cheap and reserve a room for two people, no locks on the bathroom doors and it is likely you'll hear any bathroom issues if an individual were to have any. Otherwise the room itself was very nice and worth the price. The worst part is a long, long, long walk from the room to the elevator which seems endless every time.

The amenities offered by the MGM include the cardio room, the lion habitat (it's free viewing, you figure that $20 resort fee has to maintain the lions), and the magnificent pool area. 

The pool area was phenomenal: several separate pools and the thrilling lazy river. As we enjoyed two plus hours of floating down the lazy river, we did so with round doughnut floaters available for $10 for half a day and $15 for a full day. Lockers are provided for $1.50 yet many of then were broken. As we traveled down the lazy river, we of course had drinks in hand and also nearby was a mini store and bar serving alcohol and food. Be ware, bring your own lotion as we forgot to purchase some and were shocked to discover that the sun tanning lotion we were buying was going to cost $17! Nonetheless, this minor setback would not stop us. It was like a nonstop party going around the lazy river with everyone drinking something and having a good time.

The MGM also had several dinning venues and retail stores. There is a food court that has Nathan's Hot Dogs, McDonalds, New York Pizza, Wolfgang Puck Bar and several others that are open throughout the day and into the night. The nightclubs present in this location are such places as studio 54, Vida after 10:30pm. Slots and gambling are a must while here with some tables starting at very low bets.

Overall, the MGM was a very awesome experience. The only setbacks were the enormous area that needed to be covered on foot such as walking from the elevator to our rooms, which took forever. Unfortunate, unless you know your way around pretty well, its tough to reach the strip where all the action was taking place and we were forced to catch a cab to all the locations and clubs we wanted to visit. Nonetheless, all the employees were very friendly and the cab fares relatively reasonable. Even at 4 AM, people would not stop coming in and out of the hotel, which is the reason people come to Vegas. Its a party 24-7. I must return one day once again, the Lazy River is a keeper.",0,2,0

At checking, I asked the clerk for a nice view of the strip, the picture attached is what I got.  As everyone else has already stated, you get off the elevator and start walking to your room.  The first mile (not really that long, but it seems like it is), is really nice.  Once you get to the second mile, the hallway has turned from looking like a pretty decent hotel, to a long gray and scary place.  Some of the room numbers were not even on the wall and the others looked like they were attached by thumbtacks.  Not very impressive for a hotel that's suppose to be all that.  
Once inside the room, the smell of weed was so strong it choked me.  I called the front desk to see about a change of rooms, and of course she stated they were all booked up.  Someone came up from housekeeping and sprayed the room to mask the smell.  Of course it came back the next day, but not as strong.  The coasters that were left in the room had coffee stains on them.  Surely from one of the previous guests
Housekeeping came the next morning and half cleaned the room.  Glasses that my husband and I drank out of the night before were still left on the nightstands.  The ice bucket still had melted ice in it with no change of the plastic liner.  The maid also took all the towels and didn't replace them.  I called housekeeping at 12:10 am and they stated that we would receive towels in 15 minutes.  They arrived at 12:48 with my husband having to call again.
Now for the casino.  You would think if you were giving them your hard earned money, they would be happy to keep the drinks coming.  My husband received 1 drink within a 3 hour period.   That's pretty sad....

Money - Sure, it's not expensive like Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn caliber hotels... but it's not dirt cheap like Excalibur, Stratosphere, and others.

Quality\/luxury - Assuming you don't shell out big bucks for Terrace Suite, I would say that quality is just okay.  It's not bad, but not great either.

Location - This is near the south end of the strip (in fact, almost at the end)... I would not rate location as good.

Amenities - Let's see... there's Tabu ultra-lounge, which could be fun to check out.  There are several restaurants to choose from, depending on your budget, of course... ranging from casual place like Wolfgang Puck's Bar & Grill to... expensive like Joel Robuchon.  Poker room is nice in that the rake is one of the lowest in Vegas.

So basically, nothing really stands out about the hotel.  If someone asked me ""should I stay at MGM Grand?"", I'll tell the person to spend more $ to stay elsewhere OR save even more money and stay at Excalibur, which is across the street.

Another personal negative:  cigarette smell.  I realize that smoking is part of Las Vegas and I almost consider cigarette smell as integral part of gaming floor.  BUT, you can smell cigarettes everywhere... not only in the gaming area, but also in your room (doesn't matter if your room is non-smoking or smoking), lobby, and just about wherever you go.",1,0,1

My Ant a 64 year old woman who had a stroke and her left side is paralyzed came to visit me in california. She mentioned how much she wanted to see the Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas, so I thought it would be the greatest experience for her considering she has never been to vegas nor a Cirque Du Soleil Show. I booked 3 tickets for KA and a stay at MGM GRAND because it was most convinent .

I called MGM GRAND and reserved a room in the Grand Tower for my Ant and I. I paid about $180 for a room (including resort fee of $11) for 1 night only. The price did not bother me, but the awful service I recieved for my money did!!I checked in a little before 1pm on Friday September 17th, 2010 after waiting in enourmous lines. The reservation agent was very nice and polite, he gave me a room on the 27th floor with a beautiful view of the strip.

As soon as I enter the room, I was overwhemled by the intoxicating smell of cigarettes that lingered in the room!! WHICH MY ROOM WAS ON A NON SMOKING FLOOR!! My Ant suffers from asthma and she found it very hard to breath after 20minutes in the room. I called the concierge to see what they could do about this situation. They suggested sending a box up to my room that would clear the smoke, but it would take an hour and I could not be in the room while the box was working it's magic.

I politely asked the concierge if they could wait until 2pm to bring the box up, giving us enough time to settle our things, change and go for lunch.

At 1:21pm an attendant knocked on our door with the magical smoke box. I remember clearly saying 2pm! I asked the attendant to give me 5minutes to gather ourselves for lunch since I was not expecting him here until 2pm.

We headed to the Grand Buffet @ MGM for lunch around $20 per person. BIG MISTAKE! not the price, but the food! The buffet selection was not GRAND more like BLAND!! The food was cold and lacked variety, certainly not what I expected from a Resort.

Around 3:30pm I checked back into my room and WOW THE HORRIBLE SMELL OF CIGARETTES WAS STILL THERE! and It wasn't my imagination, but the smell was worse AND THE MAGICAL SHIT BOX WAS STILL THERE! (this box was only suppose to be in my room for 40minutes-1hour max) I thought maybe we could tolerate it considering the view was nice. 10 minutes later my Ant was complaining about her respiratory system and I called the concierge to see if there was something else we could do. They said they could switch me from the 27th floor to the 17th floor. I thought ""Really? your going to drop me 10 floors? I could've paid $40 dollars more and have a junior suite at The Signature Towers then put up with this bullshit at the Grand Towers.

4:30pm I took all of my luggage and headed downstairs to the concierge where I told the manager that I wanted my money back, I no longer wanted to stay in this hotel and that their service is horrible. They clearly were neglecting me and switching me to whatever was most convenient for them and I've had enough. I told her that I checked in a little before 1pm and I had been dealing with my room situation for 4 1\/2 hours which was unacceptable and clearly unprofessional.

She gave me the most fake courtesy speech that sounded like it came straight out of her ass. ""All of our guests are important, just like you."" And blah blah blah. If I was important to you, I wouldn't have to deal with this hassle. she offered a room on the same floor same view different angle, I looked at my aunt and felt terrible so I accepted.
The room was like our first room but without the horrible smell. This should've been our first room.

I didn't have much time, and could only stay in Vegas for 1 night. I had plans of enjoying the pool side for an hour or two which I didn't get to do. The only thing we did do was visit Cesar's Palace 'The Forum Shops' before check in at MGM GRAND and The Cirque Du Soleil show KA at 9:30pm.

The KA show was spectacular, truly mind blowing and gave me a memory that will last a lifetime. MGM GRAND also gave me a memory that will last a lifetime:  I'M NEVER STAYING IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN, I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, THEY LEFT ME WITH THE FEELING OF BEING PUNY AND NOT WORTHY OF PROPER SERVICE.

MGM GRAND, I hate you. Ka was the only thing you had to offer that made my horrible stay a bit better. I will never return to your hotel under this management!
I wasted 4  1\/2 hours of my time, of my life when I could have been laying by the pool or at the spa enjoying my 1 day vacation in Vegas. Thank you for the memories.
OH AND TO TOP IT OFF-  AS WE'RE CHECKING OUT OF OUR ROOM AT 4AM, OUR NON SMOKING HALLWAY REAKED OF CIGARETTE, AND WE SHARED THE ELEVATOR WITH A PROSITUTE THAT WAS STILL PUTTING HER CLOTHES ON. MGM YOUR STANDARDS ARE REALLY GRAND!",1,3,0

It is amazing what the hotels can get away with charging for in their ""resort fee"". Our super-slow internet? Resort fee. The pool that is closed for the winter? Resort fee.

MGM has a perfectly fine casino - nothing special, but all of the bells and whistles. I have not played any table games here, but my friends played poker and said the dealers were good and knew what they were doing (which wasn't always the case at other places, like Excalibur). 

The sports book here is mediocre. People talk it up, but I wasn't a big fan. It's only a few rows deep and very wide, which isn't so much the issue. Rather, the people here are probably the worst I have come across in Vegas. Not to say they're rude...but they're not friendly. Other places have terrific Sports Book employees (Paris is the best in my mind), but MGM's are not too great. 

Bathrooms are relatively common and clean enough. They have a 24 hour Starbucks location which is nice. Could use a couple more (and better) places to grab a quick bite.",0,0,0

Die Poolanlagen, insbesondere der Lazy River, versprühen sowohl entspanntes Sonnen, als auch Partylaune. Am Wochenende ist der Lazy River gut gefüllt und die meist jungen Leute machen den Tag schon zur Party. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut. Vll hätte hier ein bisschen mehr Abwechselung nicht geschadet für einen Preis von circa 15€ pro Person (alle Getränke inklusive).

The hotel facility is nice, modern, clean and altogether pleasing considering the relative bargain you can get if you book far enough in advance. Why I don't give five stars however is because it seems like now there's a charge for everything. They charge for parking, resort fees, room upgrade fees etc. etc. If we hadn't upgraded the room, I've been told we would have been a shoebox, so the upgrade fee was kinda mandatory if you plan on doing any in room relaxing. All in all I am pleased but if they can cut the resort buckle and dining I'd definitely go back.",0,0,0

I've stayed at other hotels and they've always added late check out at no hassle.

I would describe our room as very modern and functional. The room came complete with a ""black out"" screen over the window that was great for a hangover or anyone with a desire to take a quick nap in the afternoon. OH AND THE BEDS! The beds are great, they make you never want to leave the room. The beds there are so comfortable they sell them at the giftshop in the entrance and believe me by the time you leave you'll want to buy one of them while you exit.

The airconditioning on our floor was ice cold (great for the weekend I came, because it was 125 degrees outside at one point) and the rooms were stocked with toiletries and fresh towels. The maids were courteous, they never once came barging in.

The pools are great! There are so many of them (and Steve Aoki currently has a residency at the MGM Grand so he plays by the pool during the day) and the bars by the pool were kind enough to provide us with free water refills. My only compliant was the water in the lazy river pool was a little dirty.

Lastly the breakfast buffet I went to at the MGM was okay, instead of self-service on drinks like water and coffee there were waiters. The food was pretty good but not great. The MGM Grand was a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend it.",2,0,0

From the last time I've been here, the rooms have changed a lot. Now it's all modern looking. I guess hotels just have to be renovated in order to compete with other cooler and more luxurious hotels and to keep the guests staying. 

The room was alright. It was clean. The bathroom was eh. I didn't like the smell of the shower curtain. It had a mildew smell, i was gagging while taking a shower.. i had to squirt those shower gel on the curtain to use it as an air freshener. haha  
The shower head was so slow.. imagine if you're at home and your other family members are using the shower at the same time... everyone's fighting for the water flow. Yeah, that's how it was. With that nice looking shower head, i thought it was a powerful one. but nope... weak. And no matter what setting i used it was just slow. 

Went down to the pool ... there were two big pools, 1 volleyball pool, 1 lazy river that's attached to a pool w\/ waterfalls. I love the lazy river -- so relaxing. Oh and FYI..those tube \/ live saver thingy is $16 each to rent! i was like what the crazy!?!??! 

Staffs were friendly when I checked in. I like how they have the orange and lemon infused water in the lobby for guests to quench their thirst on a hot day.

That's all closed now, but even though the MGM is quickly making its way toward the Vegas chapter of AARP (that starts at, what, 20 years old?), it remains one of my favourite places on the Strip.

First of all, it's super easy to park here and get on and off the Strip without having to actually drive on the Strip.  The parking lot entrance is on Trop and you and exit via Koval and never have to turn onto LV Blvd.  The casino itself has been well kept up although I will forever miss the mini Emerald City at the end of the rainbow.  (Toto was once kidnapped for ransom, no joke.)  There a about a billion restaurants to choose from from master chefs like Wolfgang Puck and Emeril Legasse, and even if you don't like it all you can't say you don't have a choice.

You can stand in line for an hour and a half to discuss if you have nothing else to do in life. The escalators were broke and not operating on a regular basis not to mention the TV that had to be repaired multiple times. Oh, and if you want to use Uber or other shared rides expect to be punished for it.

PROS:
1) Large, open hotel with everything you'd ever want\/need: tons of restaurants, 2 nightclubs, lots of gaming, good shows, shopping.
2) The rooms are clean and comfortable. Better than some other rooms I've stayed in on the strip. Are they 5-star, ultra-luxury? No. But when I go to Vegas, I don't spend much time in my hotel room, so I don't need something 5-star. 
3) Value - great value for the price. Well worth it.
4) Pool - of all the hotels I've stayed at, MGM has the best pool. There are 4 of them, plus a lazy river. I've never had any issues getting a chair and there's plenty of sun, but also nice lush landscaping.
5) I've always found the staff to be helpful and accommodating.
6) Great energy... and lions! Real ones!

CONS:
1) There are some 5,000 rooms in this place. Unless you're some high-roller, don't expect to get 5-star service everywhere you go. I'm totally fine with this, and never have the expectation of someone personally wiping my butt for me, but some people think they're that special.
2) The hotel is older, but not in a dirty\/run-down way. It's just not as new as some of the other hotels, but it's worth saving some $$.
3) The location at the south end of the strip does make it tough to walk to properties on the north end. However, getting to NY NY, then to Excalibur is super fast and easy. You don't even need to go down to the street.
4) When I was there, the ""casual dining"" cafe wasn't open 24 hours, which is a bummer when you're hungry at 2 am, and the only thing open is a more expensive restaurant, when you're really rather have pancakes and hash browns.

I love MGM and would highly recommend it to anyone going to Vegas. If you're into nightlife, check out Studio 54 -- one of my favorite clubs.",1,0,0

Stayed there this past weekend and LOVED IT!!  We did the check in at the airport and  avoided the long lines at the mgm  lobby. I read as many reviews as I could in the 70 days  before our trip so I knew exactly what to expect. Some of the idiots on here shouldve done the same thing and maybe they wouldn't be bitching about stupid little things like ""omg  the TV in our room wasn't a flat screen!!, OMG we did not have  a coffee maker in our room!!! OMG the water pressure in the bathroom  was weak(turn the knob idiot)!! OMG  we were at the very edge of the strip.""  Hey MORONS, that's what websites like this one and trip advisor are for.  Quit complaining because you were too stupid to research your trip...
 The rooms were perfectly acceptable. Average size, comfy bed, great view of strip if you ask nicely. We  were lucky enough to  get a room on the 21st floor, next to our friends so no complaints about that.  Reception  on TV was sub par but who's watching TV in Vegas? Casino is really nice and you can hardly smell the smoke. AS previous reviews have stated, casino has a nice perfume to cover smell up. Dining options are a plenty, from $$$$-$. So if you lose tons of money like I did, there is always McDonald's :) 
Pool area is overrated.  A bunch of douche bag drunks when I was there and the pool had a disgusting layer of suntan lotion floating above it at all times(In directors pool at least).  Weather was nice but pool needed to be 100 times colder  then the nasty luke warm  temp it was on my one and only trip down there(nice little walk btw)...
 You should def try to catch Ka if you are there(awesome awesome show) you will be amazed!! The theater itself is really cool and not a bad seat in the house.  Oh and here is a tip, If you are on a high floor and the elevator lobby is full, go through the double doors towards the back and get on the elevator that goes to the penthouse because its usually empty.  When you're checking out, get on  an elevator going up instead of down as those will probably be jammed with idiots by the time they get to you. 
We did have an issue with cleaning staff as I overflowed the john, they took a while to get there and then never cleaned up the mess from the water. No biggy though as we had friends across the way :)  Walls are paper thin though so be aware because you could here your neighbors and vice versa pretty damn good if you are trying to sleep.

However there is excellent service here and the buffet is one of the best buffets on the strip, not to mention included with your stay.  It is also in a nice location near some other fun casinos. But I don't think I will be staying here ever again if not completely because of how horribly uncomfortable the pillows are... where does the money go?",2,1,0

MGM Grand is the perfect place to stay if you like the following: gambling, eating, & partying at the pool. It's located at a prime location along the strip and has it's own monorail stop, which makes things more convenient if you need to go to a farther location along the strip. Calvin Harris was DJing the first night we stayed and entrance to his pool party was free to hotel guests. Nice! 

We stayed in the Grand Tower on the 19th floor with great views. The biggest con I could think of was their incredibly small suite! We stayed in a ""suite"" with 2 queen beds but there was nothing about the room that indicated it was a suite. I definitely felt cramped in there. 

I do want to end this review on a good note though. My favorite part of staying at the MGM Grand? Their incredible shampoo and conditioner LOL My hair never looked so great! Nice, soft, and shiny ;)",10,4,8

5-stars because:
- MGM properties treat military service members and Vegas locals pretty well in my experience.  With either a locals ID or military ID (I have both but of course I just have to show one of them) I don't have to pay a cover charge to get in to their bars\/lounges\/clubs (Coyote Ugly, Tabu, Studio 54 back when it existed, etc).
- Free trams\/shuttles\/people-movers between their properties: Treasure Island-Mirage; Bellagio-CityCenter-Monte Carlo; Excalibur-Luxor-Mandalay Bay.

After marching down to the counter the following morning, there was nothing that could be done except attempting to move us 20 floors up and for goodwill, knock off the 25 dollars a day resort fee that all mlife hotels charge.  Granted, it was a nice attempt, but at this point, my trip was pretty much ruined.  This is not the experience I want to have on vacation.  We should've had the 26th floor room to start, and nobody would be upset.  In any case Stewart was a doll. He told me to come back before 4pm to pick up our new room keys.

And off we went to explore the Strip.

However, near noon, I got a call from a local Las Vegas number which leaves a voicemail.  Guess who?  It's the assistant manager at MGM Grand, Shannon!

Great gal, she is apologetic, sincere, and it didn't hurt that she was more than willing and able to accomodate our upset *sses.  First thing she did: check into upgrade options.  Still no go, that's ok.  Then she moved us to the 25th floor.  THEN she tapped on lifting the charges for our second night stay at the MGM.  Which being a Friday night was more expensive than the Thursday night, so hallelujah to that.  Nice lady.  Told me that they would follow upon whoever touched the account that messed it up so badly.  Wished us a pleasant stay.

**Now, why is it just one star better?  Look, let's believe that the next time I'm staying at a Las Vegas hotel, it's not going to be MGM.  If my pals want to book a room, it's not going to be MGM.  But I'll give 'em a star at the attempts of Stewart and Shannon.  Great service recovery.  I still had to stay one night on the 3rd floor with a ""decent"" view with a no smoking room at that.  Which given that we were only there 3 days and 2 nights, makes that about 40% of the trip.  So solid customer service team, but it took too long for them to reach out to me.

MGM GRAND will always be one of my favorites. The mile-long lazy river is one of the biggest draws here. Mandalay Bay has a lazy river as well, but in my opinion, is too small, and not as clean as MGM's.

There are 4 pools at MGM, on a 6-acre property, with the addition of the lazy river. The lazy river closes at 6pm, but a couple of the other pools (Talent is one) stays open an extra hour. For the lazy river you'll need an inner-tube to float through the lazy river. There was a time a few years ago when you could bring in your own (large ones just like the lazy river's were being sold) --but MGM was finding people were getting them sooo much cheaper elsewhere, and the secret was squashed. You can't bring in outside inner tubes anymore. Inner tubes will cost you $16\/each. Of course, you can still 'walk' the lazy river, but it's just not as much fun. Be advised Las Vegas's pools in general all close during winter months.

This hotel is enormous. And self contained. It's like Emerald City with its recent renovation (and every single room has been upgraded), and so much has been done in the last 2 years, as the total reno started. We got lucky & got upgraded to higher levels as we returned more times to the MGM.

There's not enough room to describe an experience at MGM Grand Hotel here, from the comic act of Brad Garret (as you check in) it's to the right, the many shops and top-notch gourmet restaurants here on an entire lower level, or the valet parking where $2 is a good tip, from the lions den in the lobby, to the many casinos ...and hello Centrifuge... A pretty blue-hued cocktail bar. Dress up to go to Centrifuge, as it's a high-class martini bar. They'll make whatever you want. Jerry Seinfeld was the best act I've seen in Vegas. EVER. That is at Caesar's Palace's Colosseum. No worries. Concierges at MGM will arrange everything for you. Don't forget, a $2 tip goes a long way when service personnel do anything for you.

MGM has lots of money to spend, and have some of the best people performing on their properties. Jake Gyllenhaal was apparently seen there for the recent (controversial) fight, and I've seen lots of celebs walking through, Pamela Anderson was with Tommy Lee.....so chances of seeing celebrity is high here. If you're interested in that thing. I never bother them, they are people, just like anyone else, there to enjoy themselves. Be respectful. Always.

Everything MGM is or does is A.Class.Act.",5,2,2

Only downfall, the river that includes the kid's pool opens at 10 am and closes by 7:30pm. They should open it up earlier for the kids that wake up at 7 and want to go swimming after breakfast.

Buffet: Use to be a top place to go however there is now a shortage of selection, maybe it was a weekday...still no excuse! The highlight was the dessert section. Not sure if it's worth the price.

Oddities: The West Wing lobby...weird how you get there...and why is there a bar? You have to see it to understand how odd it is.

Them: we gave you a complimentary upgrade.  [Translation: Either there are not any rooms with two queen beds available or we are too lazy to find any].  You're welcome for upgrading your room.  Us: I'm sorry, this is not going to work.  Let me talk to someone who understands words.

After being passed to three people, we found someone who understood the situation and we finally were given the correct room.  But without a fridge - I couldn't believe it!  And one remote for two TVs.  Hmm.  I never actually slept in the bed all weekend, but it looked comfortable.  The two showers were nice, and there was a massive sink area, another plus.

The hotel itself was larger than some small towns.  It was immense.  By the end of the weekend though, I could easily maneuver it.

So after dinner and little bit of gambling, as tired as we were, we had to pack up and go and unpack at our new room. We woke up with more bug bites at our NEW room. Our sheets and blankets were dirty and the towels smelled funky. Plus, when we checked into our new room, the lights didn't turn on so we had called the maintenance guy. Our room had two queen size beds and one of them had a dent in the middle, sort of like a V-shape. My sister woke up with a terrible back ache. So we went back to front desk 2nd night in a row. The supervisor on duty was Ms. Buchner and she was a total bi*ch and said we maybe having allergic reaction. WTH? She didn't want to see our pictures of dirty sheets or our bites. She was unsympathetic, cold and unwilling to really do much. She refused to comp the room so I had to insist that she needed to go someone above her which she reluctantly ended up doing, and we moved AGAIN. But we both woke up with more bites! At this point, we just gave up. We weren't going to move again. Our last night, my sister ended up sleeping on the floor. The bed was too uncomfortable. We were leaving the next day anyway. But in the middle of all the chaos of moving to different rooms, my sister had left her bathing suit in one of the rooms and couldn't get it until the next day after 3pm because they were spraying the room. So one of our days at the pool was ruined. When we were checking out, as I had expected, the bill wasn't right. They didn't comp our room for the night they were supposed to.

We paid in advance for tickets to one of their shows and then when we showed up they refused us admission because one of the men in our party was wearing (very upscale, not denim and not short) shorts! This is July in Vegas. It was over 100 degrees! Then they refused to refund our ticket money. I smell a scam, as I have seen this comment in other reviews as well. There is no dress code posted on the web site or anywhere else, and as it happens, the gentleman in our party refused entrance...TO A FREAKING FREAK SHOW...is a professional model who is often paid to attend high-end parties in NY to add high end atmosphere. In short, I will never again set foot in the MGM Grand or any of its affiliated properties. Fortunately I had paid for the tickets by credit card, so when refused a refund I just contacted my bank and stopped the charge (and suggested they take a look at how many other people MGM tries to rip off in this manner). The Excalibur is classier, cleaner and friendlier. That is NOT a compliment.",1,1,1

Their higher-end restaurants were also better than expected, except for Fiamma- blecch

Negatives included boring, often rude blackjack dealers, poor cocktail service in the blackjack area, very little shade available at the pools unless you purchase a cabana (and, you know, it's HOT in the Vegas sun... there was also very limited waitstaff working the pools), the room air conditioner couldn't keep my room cool, and huge crowds everywhere

Actually, if there was a half button, i'd give them 4 1\/2 stars. They're a bit outdated in my opinion. From the furniture to the appliances. I haven't seen such an old TV in 5 years. Come on MGM, replace them. O and the fridge is way too tiny to fit ANYTHING.

Now for the good stuff. It wasn't even Memorial Day or Labor Day but Vegas was super packed. One bed was going for $250 and up per night if you're looking for a place on the strip. With rates like that, its great if you know someone, and know someone we did. Ended up getting the Marquee Suite which are those rooms at the very end of the hallway with double doors. YEP!! 3 girls in a 1500 sq ft suite. What a waste dont you think? The view was fabulous, and so was the place. Wall to wall windows, with a lovely living room dining room and bar separating the two master bedrooms. But move away from the big stuff, and its the little things that make the biggest difference. Marble tops, robes, sandals, 2 beautiful bathrooms with a spa tub. We used those bathrooms to death. Im sure housekeeping freaked out seeing the mess a couple of girls are capable of. 

Catch a showing of KA, look at some LIONS, stop by the pool with their LAZY RIVER or go to WET REPUBLIC, shop, eat, gamble. They may be outdated but the fact that they do boast some of the best shows as well as parties should be something. I'm inclined to say I am a bit biased, been coming here since I was just a wee tike with the fam and got nothing but good memories back then too.

1)  When we checked in, they recommended that we ""upgrade"" to a room in the West Wing.  After walking what felt like at least a 1\/4 mile to get to our room (through a very dark, narrow hallway), we got to our tiny room.  There was only one small window over the bed, and the room in general was very dark.  We then walked the 1\/4 mile back to the front desk and requested a room change and we were put in a Grand Tower room (which is what we had reserved in the first place).  I will say that we were very happy with our Grand Tower room.  It was somewhat basic, but very clean and I loved the Jasmine scented bath products.

2) I felt like we were on Spring Break, except that we would have enjoyed that ten years ago.  Picture people running through the halls at 2a.m. screaming,  wasted people hanging out in the lazy river drinking (and I am assuming not getting out to pee.  ew!), it got old very quickly.  The worst part was that I felt like it was no place for the few families that we saw who were trying to actually use the lazy river for it's intended purpose.  Little kids really shouldn't have to fight their way through a crowd of wasted dudes to enjoy the pool!

3) I did really love the restaurants.  We had an amazing dinner at  Nobhill Tavern, and great sandwiches at  'wichcraft

4) I liked the location, we were able to get to the tram that takes you from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay pretty quickly, and we took the Deuce to the Bellagio which was also very quick and easy.

5) The staff was very helpful and polite.  Everyone we met was very courteous and friendly.   Especially a nice man on the housekeeping staff who explained that the red dot next to our room number meant that our window was designed for helicopter pickups in the event of a fire!  He told us not to jump heh heh.",0,0,0

I used expedia.com to book a package deal for our vacation to Las Vegas. I wanted to stay at one of the better hotels, so I selected the MGM Grand Las Vegas which had a high star rating. The package deal I chose included five days, four nights, and airfare roundtrip for two people. At the time of booking, I didn't have any familiarity with Spirit Airlines, who was the airline for this trip. See my review on this horrible carrier on Yelp. The package price was a great deal, so I initially thought until Spirit Airlines hit us up for additional undisclosed fees close to the trip date.

I should have done a little more investigation about the wing, room, and amenities at the MGM Grand before booking the trip. I'm not so sure I would have canceled the trip, but at least I would have been more prepared for what to expect from the largest single hotel in the United States, with 5,124 rooms.

I was somewhat concerned when we arrived at the hotel by taxicab from the airport, and the porter didn't greet our cab and offer to take our luggage inside for us. We checked in, got our room keys, and took the special elevators for the West Wing to the 13th floor. After stepping out of the elevator, we walked into a circular area with hallways leading in about six different directions with signs indicating a range of room numbers. I didn't see a sign with our room number on it. Our room number was higher than any number shown, so we went to the hallway with the highest number thinking that maybe they extended the rooms and didn't update the sign. These hallways were long, incredibly long; about a block long. While walking down the hall, about halfway, the carpeting, wallpaper, wall lamps, and decor changed. It was similar to stepping from a modern, art deco hotel into an old dingy, non-renovated hotel. We got to the end of the hall where the numbers stop just short of our room number. I asked a housekeeper about the room number, showing her my key card holder with the room number on it. She spoke little English, but enough to tell me that the room number didn't exist. She told me that I would have to go back to the desk to inquire about it. I told her that I was not walking all the way back down that hall and all the way back through the casino to the desk for a problem they created. She tried to contact the front desk on a guest's telephone and was unable to get through to the desk. Finally, I used my cell phone to call the hotel directly and spoke to an agent. I explained the dilemma. She looked up my account and told me that I was in another room. The original agent scrawled the number on my key card holder so that one of the numbers looked like another number. I was beyond frustrated. We walked back down the hallway to our room.

When I opened the door, I saw a tiny room; 350 sq. ft. It held a king-sized bed, which was very comfortable, firm, the way I like it. There was a small desk, lamps on either side of the bed, a floor lamp, a TV, and a bathroom area where there was a tiny vanity with a pedestal sink, narrow shelf, a toilet and shower stall separated by frosted glass and frosted glass doors that didn't close all the way and banged shut when you let go of the doors.

It's not that it mattered too much since the only thing we were going to do is sleep in the room; somewhere to crash. Our time was going to be spent on the Strip and doing activities. However, I expected a little more for a 4.5 star rated hotel.

I visited all the casinos in Vegas, but when I lived in California and made trips to Vegas regularly, I stayed at a timeshare so I really cannot rate other hotel rooms. I'm giving MGM Grand a 3-star rating based on the ineffective porter service, poor writing skills from the desk agent, the incomplete renovation of our wing, and the poor taste in design of the bathroom area.",2,0,0

Big complaint: Our room was in the West Wing.  It was built way back when and renovated. They didn't bother to add a new elevator shaft when they connected the new MGM to the West Wing. So you walk for about 15 mintues to get to your room, and then 15 minutes back.  
The ceilings are really low- it's like walking into a fading perspective drawing.  There are mirrors at the end of the hallway- so it looks like you'll be going on forever.  After hiking the length of the West Wing to the elevator, we had to hike back again on our floor to get to our room.
The interior of the room is quite modern- glass and mirrors abound.  Heavy glass doors on both the bathroom stall and the adjacent shower.  (No tub). 
My favorite feature was the lighted and magnified make up mirror. 2nd favorite feature was the shower.

We had 3 rooms, and ours was in the west wing while the other two were in the Grand Tower, so it made for a little bit of a haul. Our room was much smaller than the other two couples got and as the owner of a king sized bed, I know the bed was a little smaller than a standard King. 

There are a ton of great restaurant options and food court and the breakfast buffet is pretty solid for only $19. Overall, I was very pleased and would recommend the MGM.",2,1,1

Check in- Private check in in the Stay well lounge helped me save time by skipping that huge line. There was complimentary water in there as well. I think that was great,

Room: The room was wonderful, Stay well has a lot more amenities such as the scent cube for aroma therapy, the air purifier, the Vitamin C infused shower, the wellness lighting......It was very comfortable. So comfortable in fact that i booked another room tomorrow just to relax. i LOVE the fact it includes complimentary access to the Grand Spa, not many hotels do that anymore so i really thank MGM Grand for doing it.

Buffet: Its gotten MUCH better over the years, the food was very good.

Grand Spa: it was so relaxing, the facilities were well maintained and it really was a joy to relax there.

I checked into the hotel with no problem explaining my situation to the front desk, which the wait to check in was well over an hour it was completely ridiculous. During the duration of my stay I was stop multiple times by security asking me why I need my dog, they were very rude and pushy. One security guy even corned me and demanded I give him a full explanation of my medical issues just so he can decide if I have a valid enough excuse to be allowed to be in the hotel. It was insane, I have never been treated so badly. It's actually illegal to ask someone what there special needs for a emotional support or service dog is. I felt so violated, the whole stay I felt very uncomfortable I couldn't relax. I was harassed so many times I lost count. I do understand they have to do there job in making sure I am legit with my dog but come on, they obviously don't have there shit together. What they should have done when I checked in is to send a memo to the security people telling them that there is a service dog in the building or maybe give me a special tag to attach to my dogs vest so they don't have to approach me every 20 feet. There was a few staff members who were very nice to me but generally it was a horrible experience and when I notified the front desk when I checked out that I wasn't happy with my stay, they said,"" I don't know what to say...sorry...."". Really?! That's all you have to say after I just spent almost $2000 in your hotel.

The dining was a disappointment. Only the Studio Cafe was decent. Everywhere else had slow service, and the food was second-rate and overpriced.

In MGM's defense, we did voice our concerns to the front desk and they did offer us an immediate upgrade. It was a newly renovated double queen bed, with a tub and nice view for an extra $15 a night. With a working thermostat! Also, it was on the 16th floor of the Grand tower compared to the 2nd floor of the ghetto West wing tower.

We recently spent the weekend in Vegas and decided to return to MGM because it was the cheapest room available for what we had remembered to be a decent hotel. Not luxury by any means, but fun and easy. It was still fairly expensive ( $160\/night), but we figured that it would be as good as we remembered and thus worth the value. 

THE GOOD:
Restaurant selection. The restaurants at the MGM grand are awesome and you can find all kinds of food at various price points. 

The pool- The pool scene at MGM is great. Complete with 2 huge pools and a lazy river there is something for everyone. 

The Casino- My husband loves the MGM poker room and he seems to do much better here than any other poker rooms. We left the trip up hundreds of dollars- score!

The lions- okay i love animals and this is seriously a highlight for me.


THE BAD!: 
Smokey. Compared to some of the newer casinos with better ventilation and higher ceilings, this is the type of place where smoke hits you in the face as soon as you walk in. You leave with your clothes, hair, etc. all smelling like cigarettes.

CROWDED. Seriously- this hotel is ginormous. And the wait for the elevator shows it. Be prepared to wait a few mins for the elevators and sometimes have to pass them up because of over crowding. Or, in my case be smooshed up against some strangers for the long trip up\/down.

No shopping! Besides a giftstore, a  sunglasses shop, and a douche-lord shop ( ie selling a lot of affliction, ed hardy, and true religion), there was no other retail shops. I like to spend some money in Vegas, and I had to venture over to Planet Hollywood for this.

THE UGLY!!!: 
LACK OF AMENITIES: we had tons of leftovers from our delish ( and expensive) dinner at NobHill. We knew there was no refrigerator in the hotel room, but assumed we could store with the hotel since this is how it works at the nicer casinos we've stayed at ( palazzo, Encore, Bellagio).... We called down to arrange this and not only we were told we couldn't store with them but we were also informed there was a $35 rental fee for a refrigerator. What if i had medication that needed to be refrigerated? Its really not cool to not offer a free way of refrigeration to your guests. we also noticed there was no coffee maker either. 

The rooms- Big box TV's, gross shower heads ( with awful temperature control), and old furniture. 

The Noise- You know how in vegas people get really drunk and shout all the way back to their rooms at 5am? Well normally I feel like this sound is somewhat muffled by large sturdy doors or something. In MGM it felt like these fools were IN our room! Thank god for blackout shades otherwise it would've been a sleepless night for me.

First, they have lions. Only joking, but they do make for some amusing late night companions while stumbling back into the hotel. 

As for the key components, the rooms were clean (and housekeeping did a great job every day), spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms were huge - enough for the three girls in my room to all do makeup\/hair\/girl talk at once. We did wish there was another full length mirror outside of the bathroom. Also, the shower head was super low. It boggles the mind when I see this in hotels, and when you're a tall drink of water like myself, you notice it more often than not. I'll never stop complaining about it. 

What the shower lacked, the bed made up for big time. I must have said it at least ten times throughout my three night stay: I loved the bed. It was like sleeping on a cushy cloud, only with down pillows and blankets everywhere. I don't think I've ever slept in a more comfortable bed. And I slept like a dream every single night, despite my nagging cold. 

One of the best parts about MGM Grand is the pool area. There are three huge pools to choose from (including a lazy river), towel service and other necessary amenities. A bar and quick order walk-up restaurant are conveniently located and there was rarely a long line. The cocktail menu even features four ""skinny cocktails"" under 100 calories each. I became addicted to the Drunken Palmer as I happily tanned myself on a chaise.

Parking: Parking was easy, the structure is easy to get to and it's location is fairly close to the lobby. It is $12 per day, but if you add it to your room charges, then you can use your room key for in and out privileges at all of the MGM owned properties, which I thought was great!! 

Check in: I was a little scared because it was a Friday afternoon, but the check in was so quick! There were approximately 20 people in line, but there were also 20 front desk clerks checking people in! We only waited about 5 mins to get checked in! Great! The girl that helped us was so sweet! I had originally booked a West Wing King room, but I asked if there were any complementary upgrades available and she said yes! She got us into a Grand Queen room with a view of the strip, with no additional charge! Thanks girl! 

Room: It wasn't very much of a difference from the West Wing, but it was something! The bathroom was bigger then what the other room had, so I was happy. We inspected the beds as we arrived, since i heard about a recent beg bug incident. Everything looked clean and great! They had extra pillows in the closet and plenty of towels. They do have a mini fridge, but the girl at the front desk warned us that everything inside has a sensor, so if we move anything, we'll be charged for a restocking fee and the item. Refrigerators were available though for an additional $25.  

I liked how it was fairly close to a lot of things on the strip and how easy it was to get from one place to another, and all the restaurants the hotel had. We also checked out Tiesto at the Hakkasan and had a lot of fun! The pool was great! I had never been to any pools in Vegas and I really wanted to try these out. I say these because there were literally like 4 pools, plus a lazy river and a jacuzzi! So impressive!

I called the front desk and they told us they had nothing else available, even after asking twice, the girl said there were no room available we would have to wait for staff to clean our room. REALLY? The only other option was a 2 bedroom on the same floor. We were tired after the long drive and said fine.

Going into the 2 bedroom we realized it was worse than the first. The closet was almost non existent, the lights flickered, the window shades were crooked. We were basically downgraded as their solution to not having our room ready.

We went down to the front desk lugging our stuff with us and complained that we needed a new room. Magically one appeared, after I was told over the phone there were none available. They gave us a $50 credit for food. Whoop dee doo.

I do not believe I will be staying at the MGM Grand again. With the dirty room, having to pay for parking, and all the added hotel tax fees it for not seem worth it to me.

I would Suggest staying off the strip where you actually get what you pay for.",3,0,1

The Good:
-The Resort is truly massive. You could stay here for a couple days and never leave once. I'm sure this is by design but really, everything you could possibly need (at least temporarily) is here. 
-My room in the Grand Tower (11th floor) was very nice and the bed was super comfy. This is the first tolerable hotel bed I've stayed in since I bought a top of the line Tempur-Pedic a few years back.
-Beautiful pools and an excellent business center (that I spent several days in).
-Very good restaurants, several with a respectable craft beer selection.
-Quality of staff was very high, particularly the housekeeping staff and those attending to the gaming floor. 
-The price is definitely right 

The Bad:
-I spent well over 30 minutes in line waiting to check in on a Sunday evening. A coworker who showed up in the afternoon waited over an hour! That is completely unacceptable.
-When I got to my room, it was a room with two Queens instead of a single King (as I had requested as I was traveling alone). But given the fact I had just waited so ridiculously long in line and was already late for a business conference, I did not have time to complain about the oversight. 
-The pools are only open until 6pm. Being that I was there for a business conference, this sadly left me ZERO time to enjoy said pools.
-The place is so incredibly massive that it can take you well over 20 minutes to get from point A to point B. And this comes from me, a fast walker.

Anyway, as stated, I will definitely be back. Hope to visit while there is an event taking place at the Arena (which I've heard is lovely).",2,1,1

The lady that checked us in for some reason found it appropriate to walk away, go in the back room and take her sweet time while I watched people get check in other lines. Once we got checked in our room was umm okay. I was absolutely surprised by the room. It was so outdated and looked nothing like the picture. I pulled up the picture on my laptop and sure enough the same items in the room, but boy they did a good job and making the room like different. The room looks like a 70's throwback and I cannot imagine a ""celebrity"" would every choose to stay there. Believe it or not, that was the least of the rooms problems. When I tried to put my bags in the closet, the closet door was broken. When I tried to take a shower, the shower door wouldn't close. I tried not to worry about it because I was on my honeymoon, but on the second day the water stopped working. Seriously, stopped working. Yes I was on my honeymoon and the toilet wouldn't flush. At this point I had had it so I called down to the front desk. The lady said that the whole floors water was off and it should be up and running in an hour or so. I said umm that's not okay, can I speak to the manager. I was able to speak to the manager who was beyond understanding. She quickly changed our room after finding out that we were on our honeymoon. We had the most amazing trip ever because of the manager. It was well worth the disastrous beginning. Oh and the room that she moved us to... was a terrace suite.",0,0,0

We stayed in the west tower in one of the basic rooms. It was a pretty tiny room, but the room was clean and nice despite it's small size, so I was fine with it. The bathroom was really compact and was there to greet you as soon as you walked in the room. My only real complaint would be that there was no real counter space whatsoever just primarily a sink and storage underneath, so not a whole lot of space for us ladies to lay out our makeup and stuff lol, but that didn't bother me too much. Also the remote for the TV wasn't working consistently, but we weren't planning to just sit inside and watch TV all day anyways, so it wasn't too much of a bother.  

Free wi-fi, but it didn't work very well to be honest. And I think it was only free for one device. 

The lobby was huge and really nice actually. Check in was pretty quick. We arrived early, maybe around 12, so our room wasn't ready yet, but the friendly lady at the desk let us check into another room early and waived the early check in fee, which we much appreciated! Our room also came with a free buffet, so that was a nice bonus. 

The casino and hotel itself was huge! it felt like forever until we made it to the pool from our room lol. So if you stay in the west tower be prepared for a journey if you plan to go to the pool. But the long walk was worth it. The pool area itself was pretty big. I think there was maybe 4 pools and a lazy river. The lazy river was nice, but if you don't like being around kids then be prepared or stay away lol. The other pools were pretty quiet and peaceful though. 

Overall I really enjoyed the MGM grand! I'd likely stay here again.",0,0,0

It's at the bottom of the strip so you have to walk to most places which can be a pain, but there is a bus stop close by. Other than that the closest other restaurants and casino was New York. But nothing is really terribly far if you are OK with walking.

Our room was 424 in the grand tower. The room was nice enough but it had a horrible view of giant green lights that light up the hotel at night. Well, the blinds suck, they need to be black out blinds. All night it felt like we were sleeping in a fish tank. The water pressure was also awful, I can't imagine what it's like on higher floors. But overall, ok. No coffee maker, and even Holiday Inn's have a coffee maker. The lines at starbucks were obscene. 

The place is a maze and the map they gives you kinda sucks. And the elevators get crazy full. We had to wait at least 20 minutes to get an elevator that we could squeeze into. Now, this was during the I Heart Radio festival and obviously had a lot to do with it. 

Service was overall good, I didn't have much interaction but with the front desk agent.

With your resort fee you get wifi which is nice. If you want to use a tube in the lazy river it's $12 which is ridiculous. The lazy river is nice but it is packed with people drinking and the water is very, very warm...you do the math. 

Overall a kind of average hotel. I think I'd rather pay a tad more to stay in a bit nicer and more updated hotel.",1,1,1

I am not one who usually complains or even writes about it, but after thinking and discussing with others, I thought it would be the right thing to let you know that I was not very happy when I left the MGM on 7\/20. 
 
Everything went well when a friend and I arrived on 7\/18. We were welcomed and was told that I would be given a room credit of $50 for it being my birthday. She said I would be able to use it on food or drinks in the MGM and just charge it to the room and it would be deducted. I was very grateful and thanked the lady at the front desk. 
 
As soon as we got to the room I noticed 2 things that I should have reported to the front desk and housekeeping, but decided to leave it be because we got in late and with it being my birthday just decided to head down to the casino. 
 
1) The comforter on the bed by the window had some type of red stain on it that crusted. I did not sleep under it and just threw it on the floor and slept under the bed sheets. 
 
2) There were 2 glasses in the bathroom that were definitely not clean. One had fingerprints all over them and the other had some resin around the rim of the cup like someone ate and drank from it and the food stuck. 
 
Again, I didn't say anything only because I didn't want to hassle anyone at the MGM and just focused on enjoying my birthday.
 
Besides those two things, the room was fine and my next complaint has to do with the checkout process.   
 
I was told that I would receive a $50 credit for food and beverage if charged to my room if purchased in the MGM. When I went to checkout there was a $32 charge for pizza purchased at the MGM food court. The lady I spoke to on the phone said that it has to be an ""MGM owned"" restaurant and that it does not count. I explained what the front desk lady said and also told her that the receipt and what the charge shows is ""MGM Bonannos"" and how would I know to differentiate when MGM shows on the receipt. She was willing to work with me and said that she couldn't do anything about the charge and instead refund the resort fees. I was told my balance and thought it was fine but then realized that she only reversed one resort fee instead of both and still was responsible for a fraction of the price of the food I thought would be free.
 
I am not complaining for the sake of complaining, but I thought you should know because a lot of people would find the first 2 things very disturbing and refuse to stay there and the other is a matter of principle. I was told one thing and it was not honored and given another option which didn't help me at all. 
 
I am a very loyal gambler at the MGM and I do have an Mlife account. This was my first official stay at the MGM and was definitely not pleased. I will say that I usually stay at the Signature but got a better deal here which was the reason I booked it. I come to Vegas about 8-10 times a year for business and leisure and always looking to stay at mlife resorts. After this experience I'm not sure I can stay at the MGM but will still use my MLife card when I am in Vegas. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",9,0,0

This is absolutely the most disgusting hotel room I have stayed in in over 5 years...and I lived overseas for 4 years.
The carpets are beyond stained. Everything in the room felt dirty and gross. 
EVERY towel\/washcloth had some sort of stain. Do you have no standard for this?
But the worst of it is the hallways. Of course, one look and the stains are disgustingly apparent. For 4 days, not ONCE was the hallway vacuumed. For 2 days, we passed the same fist-sized hairball that lay on the floor. For 2 days, we passed a line of 8 dirty glasses along the wall. For 2 days, we passed a discarded room service tray. The same small plastic child's toy was there the full 4 days.  
We even passed one day what appeared to be the 'manager' of the service staff (she was carrying a clip board and looking in on the maids cleaning the rooms and making notes on her board) and the hallway STILL remained disgustingly dirty with said items never removed.
I used to live in Vegas and the MGM was always an upscale hotel. It has gone so far downhill, I will never stay here again. And the sad part is, it's all a matter of having some cleaning standards--that doesn't even cost you more (except if you decide to discard the stained towels and buy new ones and have the carpets cleaned once in a blue moon).

FEES (An after-thought):
The resort fee (and now parking fee) and the tax on top of the resort fee is... well I guess charged at every hotel now. But if you are charging it, make the guest feel like they are getting something for it. I mean, is getting 2 towels at the pool really a problem (I couldn't even get the 2nd towel for my friend it was such a big deal--and the towel I got was streaked with yellow stains). And is charging extra for a float tube (that you ran out of anyways) really keeping you in business? Plus, no coffee pot or fridge in the rooms? I guess a big THANK YOU THANK YOU for not charging even more for Internet access (which everyone has their own now anyways) and of course, the complimentary notary service that's included in the Resort fee; I'm sure millions get their monies worth out of this (Is listing this as an included service a joke?)",0,0,0

Kein Hotel in Las Vegas bietet so eine schöne Pool-Landschaft. Außerdem wird hier alles geboten, was man will: gutes teures Essen oder eher billigeres, Gambling, Shows, etc. Schade ist aber, dass im Gegensatz zum letzten Besuch der Arcade-Bereich deutlich verkleinert wurde zugunsten der CSI Attraktion.
Leider war auch ein Pool die gesamte Zeit geschlossen, was nicht begründet wurde. Dafür war der Rest der Pool-Landschaft wie immer super. Und trotz Sommersaison waren genügend Liegen frei für uns. Ab 17 Uhr werden aber fast alle Poolbereiche geschlossen, was sehr ärgerlich ist.
Das Zimmer (Bungalow Suite) war riesig und hatte drei Fernseher: einen alten vor dem Bett, dann einen riesigen Flachbild-Schirm-Fernseher für den Wohnbereich und dann noch ein TV-Gerät, dass im Spiegel im Bad integriert war.
Das Bett war sehr bequem, genauso waren genug Schränke vorhanden. Das Bad hatte eine riesige Massage-Dusche mit zusätzlicher Regendusche, dazu zwei Waschbecken.
Leider gibt es keine Kühlschränke oder Wasserkocher auf dem Zimmer.
Außerdem hatten wir extreme Probleme mit dem Housekeeping. Zwei mal wurde unser Zimmer gar nicht gemacht. Produkte wie Duschgel, etc. wurden häufiger vergessen. Einmal kam Housekeeping nachts um 1, nachdem wir uns beschwert hatten. Allerdings dauerte es lange, bis das Housekeeping auch an unserem Zimmer ankam. Anstatt 20 Minuten dauerte die Reinigung dann auch 45 Minuten. Als wir fragten, weshalb das so lange dauerte, wurden wir bezichtigt, dass unser Zimmer scheinbar extrem dreckig sein müsste, wenn das Personal so lang braucht.
Uns wurde außerdem ein Turndown-Service für die nächsten Tage versprochen, der aber nie kam.
Da wir in einer Woche viel gespielt haben im Casino, hat uns der Player's Club außerdem zugesichert, zwei Nächte gratis zu bekommen. Beim Check-Out war davon dann keine Rede mehr und die Mitarbeiter konnten uns nicht weiterhelfen.
Bei einem weiteren Problem bezüglich von Öffnungszeiten einer Mall, nahmen wir den Concierge Service zur Hilfe. Auch da konnte uns zunächst nicht weitergeholfen werden, was mich überrascht hat. Normalerweise sollten Concierge gut informiert sein über ihre Stadt. Die Wartezeit beim Concierge war teilweise auch sehr lang (über 20 Min.)
Auch die Wartezeit beim Valet-Parking dauerte manchmal länger als 20 Minuten. Immerhin ist das Valet Parking gratis, genauso wie der Internet-Zugang.
Männer sollten spät abends nicht mehr allein im Casino unterwegs sein, da sie andauern von scheinbaren Hostessen angesprochen\/angeflirtet werden. Das kann sehr nervig werden, wenn die Freundin oben im Zimmer ist und man nur was zu trinken holen wollte. Komisch, dass sowas offensichtlich immer noch tolleriert wird vom MGM.

Alles in allem würde ich immer wieder kommen in dieses Hotel. Allerdings schafft es das MGM Grand nicht, meinen Aufenthalt zu einem völlig perfekten Erlebnis zu machen. Vielleicht kommt das noch. Und vielleicht macht auch endlich wieder der gesamte Poolbereich irgendwann auf.",0,0,1

I always enjoyed the great service, food outlets, and nightlife.  My sister and I recently stayed three nights in The Grand Tower. The two-queen room was great. The beds and linen were nice and comfortable and bless the man who installed the blackout curtains. Upon arrival, I did notice that the toiletries were not new. This included a lotion that was half used. Needless to say, I am glad I brought my own. Housekeeping did a great job over the next few days even organizing our makeup on towels.  What disappointed me this stay was the feeling that I had to beg for service. When I got it, it was wonderful, getting it was the problem. The first night we had to practically stand on our heads to get noticed by service staff in the Lobby Lounge. I saw a waitress at the other end of the bar and we waited about 10 minutes before just going up to the bar and ordering our drinks. The bartender was nice and drinks were great but moved on after not being able to find a waitress again. We found our way to the Centrifuge Bar. Again my sister and I stood there twiddling out thumbs for 10 minutes waiting for a bartender to acknowledge us. Again the bartender was nice and the drinks were ok but we did not want to wait for the service staff to get around to us again. We gambled on slots for a good 45 minutes after and not once did I see a waitress. For me gambling a drinking go hand in hand without one the other is not as fun. I was beginning to think that the MGM just did not want me to drink or gamble and I should just go to bed. The next morning we had an early and long day so I decided to order room service. This is something I have done hundreds of times but the sticker shock this time was enough to say I would never stay at the MGM again. I ordered two bagels with cream cheese, two coffees, two bottles of water and a bowl of sliced fruit. The total came to $92.00!!!! Then when I asked her to charge it to the room another thing I have dome a million times and was told I had to pay for it upfront which to avoid any further delay I did. The gentleman that brought the tray was very nice and the food was as exciting as bagels get but for sure not worth the $92.00. The third night we centered on going to the Hakkassan club to see DJ Tiesto. This is where I say I have 10 years as a nightclub manager in a major city and 10 years as a Catering Manager for a popular hotel chain. Nothing kills me then a poorly thought out nightclub. There was hundreds of people in line but being used to Vegas I bought pre-sale tickets. We got in pretty fast. But then came the 5 flights of stairs to get to the first dance floor area. It screamed fire hazard. A further set of stairs led you to a main room, which is where Tiesto was supposed to play. The lay out was 70% VIP Booths 3% Bar (as far as I could see) and the most cramped dance floor I have ever seen (as of that moment). We stayed for about 10 minutes before we decided to go find a drink, which did not happen since we were corralled back into a hallway that led to a stairwell. We decided to take the stairwell to the hip hop room which had a dance floor the size of a condo living room and at least a hundred people trying to dance. We danced for about 10 more minutes, still needing a drink but with  no bar in sight, we left. Again this room was about 70% VIP booths.  It was almost 1am and I would say 80% of those booths were empty. We braved the 5 flights of stairs out of this potential towering inferno and went to the Lobby Bar. At this point, I just wanted to drink and saw the $70 Tiesto tickets as a wash. We arrived at the Lobby Bar to what looked like 4 waitresses huddled at other the end of the bar. Waited......Waited.... And then just went up to the bar. Drinks were good but at this point we just called it a night. One bright note is that I dropped my phone and Lost and Found had it. The breakfast buffet was eh. We ate at Hecho in Vegas which was pretty good. The pool areas were nice and the whole casino in very clean. I just feel like the gold standard is gone and could pay less to get the same at another casino. FYI New York New York had the best Irish Bar ever. Maybe I will stay there next time so I can drink and gamble on my schedule not the wait staff's.",0,0,0

The terrace with the hot tub was awesome. Nookie action in the outdoor hot tub overlooking the strip made the cost of this room worth it. Also the bed and pillows were super comfortable. The view from the bed was also awesome.

HOWEVER...the little things wrong at MGM amounted this room to only 3 stars.

And the biggest thing that peeved us was THE HALLWAY WAS FILTHY!!!!! We showed up at the room and next to our door were two empty glasses and one of those plastic ice buckets you get at the pool with empty beer cans it. Across the hall were tables and chair stacked up being stored in the hallway. Also across the hall were a bunch of dirty dishes laying on the floor from someone's roomservice. All of this stuff (except the two glasses, which were there for the duration of our stay) were removed the second day of our stay.

Here is a list of the smaller problems.

1. MGM has done a terrible job of maintaining the rooms. The handle on the glass sliding door was super loose and felt like it was about to come off. I had to tighten the screws with my thumb.
2. Two of the over head lights in front of the 2 story windows were  blown out...one was just completely busted out.
3. No soap dish in the shower...you had to set your stuff on the ground when switching between soap and shampoo.
4. NO ELECTRONIC EXPRESS CHECKOUT ON THE TV. You had drop a card with you room info in the elevator lobby and examine you final bill at a later date.
5. TV in bathroom was broken
6. Maid service did not empty all of teh garbage cans

For a $1000 a night room, these problems are totally unacceptable. This easily could have been a 5 star stay except for these little things that amounted to allot.

As far as the casino goes, it was packed during the day, but died down earlier than other more hip hotels, I guess because it was more of a family place. Cocktail service while in the machines sucked, but was pretty good while we were at the tables. Dining options were probably the best of any of the hotels I stayed at. Options ranged all the way from McDonald's to some 5 star french place and everything else in between. The pool area was average, and was a long walk from the hotel.

Our bedsheets had either blood or feces stains on it, I was so disgusted and just ripped off that sheet. I was too tired to complain even more to the front desk people and disappointed already from our room.
The shower took some time to get hot water at night time. 
Our mini fridge was missing a beverage before we got in our room, but when we checked out we informed them that so they wouldn't charge us. 
We stayed on the floor that didn't allow smoking and had better air flow, minerals in our shower or something like that lol, ""stay well"" floor.

We went to the pool party, wet republic, downstairs one day and my BF stepped on glass out there, there's not supposed to be any glass out there and it's pretty serious for him cuz he's a diabetic. They got him cleaned up, but it kind of hurt his foot all day. 
The night club Hakkasan was alright, we went on a Friday night and the crowd there was ehhh.

Regular Suite:  King bed w\/ lots of room around to move.  Gigantic tub that you can swim in and a spacious bathroom to boot.  The living room is great for having a group of ppl over to preparty but the couches aren't comfy enough to crash on.  Comes with a mini fridge that is empty and you can put drinks in.  Yeah!

(Did I ever tell you that I can eat my money back in bacon? It's true, don't try to challenge me. But that's another entry.) I'm amazed by the millions of dollars poured into Las Vegas to make it what it is and respect the entrepreneurs who are just trying to get theirs. But it's not my kind of town. I like the beaches, laid back attitudes and slow pace of the tropics.
And then I was convinced by a friend to check out the MGM Grand Spa.
Oh me, oh my, my senses were met with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus. Coming from the casinos smelling of cig butt, the spa entrance was like heaven. I must have looked like I was experiencing euphoria because my friend seemed thrilled that I was loving some part of Vegas. Mind you, we were just in the front entrance.
They suggested I try a hot stone massage, promising it would be good one. We asked the spa receptionists if there were any openings for later  in the afternoon. Fate on my side, they said yes and would we be interested in checking in now? Shoot, if I was smitten with the entrance, I could only imagine what heavenly goodness was past those doors. Heck ya, check my a$$ in. We walked in an hour and a half before our appointments and were anxious to be pampered.
People, this spa was GORGEOUS. It is what every spa should look like or attempt to be. No longer will I go to a spa that lacks a lounge area. MGM Grand Spa had hot and warm pools, a TV area and a quiet area with comfy cushy chaise longues. Fruit, snacks, water, coffee and tea were also provided. We wrapped ourselves in luxuriously thick robes and dangled our legs in the hot tub. We weren't prepared with our bathing suits so we had to improvise. Ten minutes before our treatments, we went to the quiet area and relax. I was ready to nap when my massage therapist called my name.
Her name was Marla. I can't nor will I try to explain the wonders of her stone massage. Of all the massages I've ever had, hers was the best. Ever. I was ready to propose to her when she was done and I'm completely in love with my boyfriend. She led me back to the lounge area and gave me a hug goodbye. As I exited this heavenly oasis, I signed my credit card bill with no regrets.  
Please, do yourself a favor. If you are ever in Las Vegas and need a little lovin', don't bother grinding at a club, going to a skin show or entertaining a one night stand. Or do. Who am I to tell you how to get your swerve on? :) But you also got to see Marla. She will make you feel like a million bucks. And you won't go home dirty*.
When I got back from my trip, I told my boyfriend about my spa experience but didn't go into much detail. Our conversation went like this- 
Me: ""I went to a spa."" 
The Man: ""Didn't you just do that?!"" 
Me: I threw my arms around him, kissed him, and confessed, ""It's like crack! I'm addicted!""

When I came in as a guest they were helpful and great, and now I work here. The security does their job amazingly. The pool is huge and always busy (even in November) I recommend it.

I have visited Vegas numerous times before, and I wanted to stay at a better place such as the Aria or the Palazzo, but my brother (based on advertisement) paid a lot and decided to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday at the MGM ""GRAND"" (I wasn't really up for it but my family came from abroad and this is their first time here) she is six month pregnant and with a 2 years old baby. We are focussing our visit mostly for the museums, buffets and family shows. 
We arrived from L.A. really tired (having a 2 years old in the car for 5 hours, I guess you get the picture), I was hoping for an easy and welcoming check-in process but instead after waiting in line for around an hour, a new employee at the front desk gave us our rooms for the 25th floor, we went there but our keys didn't work and we had to figure out for ourselves that out rooms where actually on the 24th floor; once there, my brother, his pregnant wife and my asmathic 2 years old niece went to their (non-smoking) room that reeked to cigarettes, so I called to the front desk to ask for an accommodation and they gave us a different room in the same floor with ""a view"" (they charged us $25 extra a night per room for a strip view) facing the Mandala Bay Hotel (needless to say how awkward that was, besides there're no other big hotels on that ""view""). We went down to the lobby trying to ask for a better accommodation. Finally, after a two and a half hours check-in process and ask 5 times to be to talk to a manager, Catherine (the manager) came to ""help us"", she was super defensive and not willing to emphasize with how uncomfortable for us all this had been so far, she actually offered set up a machine to extract the oddors out of the original room or move us again to another floor. Considering my little niece's well being we decided to take our party to a lower floor and end with all this so we could relax. After two and a half our in, ""celebrating"" my pregnant sister-in-law's birthday and all the hassle we went through, our ""more than generous compensation"" (described this way by Catherine) was to refund  to us 3 of the 6 resort fees charged.

The pluses:
- There is lots to do and see.  Plenty of different places to eat and different entertainment options available for all tastes.
- Overall the room in the West Wing (steerage) was fine.  The only problems were in the bathroom, which will be detailed below.

The minuses:
- $30 mandatory ""resort fee"", for services we didn't need.  We were told we could not opt out.  considering we had to pay for it, both my wife and I tried to connect to the WiFi.  We tried several times .. never were able to connect.  I'm a techie, so I'm certan the problem was not on our end.
- The television was intermittent.  The signal would come and go.  We tried to use the check out option through the television before we left ... it was unavailable (got an error code)
- The hot water was intermittent in the shower .. fine at the sink.  There was something wrong with the mixer in the shower.  Switching from the showerhead to the handheld nozzle resulted in an extremely loud screeching noise from the pipes.
-The climate control is located in the nightstand on one side of the bed, so when the fan comes on, all the air and NOISE is in the ear of the person on that side of the bed.  This wasn't a huge deal if you sleep near the center of the king bed.
-Everything associated with the hotel is overpriced.

At this point I would have given the MGM three stars.

The worst::
Got food poisoning from one of the restaurants in the food court.  Called MGM about it and was transferred to security.  Security wasn't interested in hearing about it because it occurred at a vendor restaurant.  The security officer told me to call the restaurant, which of course I was going to do anyway.  Now, I understand that the restaurant isn't owned by the MGM, however I think that the MGM would want to know about, and monitor, a vendor who's food was making an MGM guest sick.   A quick web search revealed that this restaurant, which serves hot dogs, has made others sick.

The shortcomings in the room and the resort fee are what they are.  But blowing off a guest who was made sick by a restaurant in your facility is a deal breaker for me.",2,0,0

Anyhow, my friends and I stayed here over Halloween weekend and we got a steal on the rooms -- we're poor grad students (read low-rollers) so we had zero chance of a comp.  We booked a regular grand tower room at ~$200 total and a bungalow queen suite for ~$240 total, which was a great deal during the popular weekend.  Customer service was extremely attentive and friendly, and did not charge us extra for additional room keys.

The rooms were not overly luxurious, but did have a quality feel and furnishings well-kept even though they might be somewhat old.  The tube TVs were a bit out-dated I must say, but who goes to Vegas to watch TV?  Seriously.  The regular grand tower room is pretty comparable in size to rooms in any of the other hotels on the strip.  The bungalow queen suite included a nice spacious sitting area with a second TV, coffee table, lounge chair, and sofa (big enough for someone to sleep on actually).  The beds were just heavenly.  The only negative thing I could probably say about this place is that the walls are pretty thin.  We could hear our crazy neighbors partying hard again at 8 am the next morning!

Today we arrived at MGM at 7:10 pm. We were directed to agent Alejandro who advised we could upgrade our room to a bigger one for $150 more per night. We declined but thanked him for the offer. He then informed us our room (a grand king premier view) was not ready, but that we could have a similar room with 2 queen beds. Queen beds were not what we made a reservation for and not what we wanted. The agent then stepped away for about 15 mins and came back to tell us he could give us 2 buffets and we could wait 1-2 hours for our original room with a king bed. We had our dinner with us, which we were hoping to enjoy in our room after a day of traveling, so we really had no need for comp buffets. We were given room keys, filled out an info card with email and phone number and were told we would receive a call when the room was ready. We sat in the food court for 2 hours, ate our dinner and waited. No call came. We went back to the front desk and was told our room was ready, totally nonchalantly, like we hadn't been waiting for anything. The agent said they don't make phone calls about rooms being ready after 6pm, that department was closed. We asked to speak to a manager. 

She apologized, said Alejandro was new and they would talk to him, sorry we didn't get a phone call, he is a new agent and they did give us 2 buffets and our room had been upgraded to one with a view. 
Whether a guest gets a call or not is a pretty general info type of thing. If he disappeared to the back for 15 mins, perhaps a manager should have accompanied him back to the front to make sure he gave us the right info. Thank you manager for saying you'll talk to him about this issue, but let's be serious, that helps your hotel in its future interactions with guests, that does nothing to compensate for our inconvenience or make us feel valued as customers. As for our room with a view, that was exactly what our reservation was for, maybe you could review our record before assuming you had done us a favor. 9:50 pm we finally got to sit in our room. At this point we're just so disappointed, not excited to spend money at this hotel or ever return again.

We got to the hotel around 4pm on a Sunday. Wasn't rushing for the 3pm check in, just to give the lines a chance to die down a bit. Boy was I wrong about that! We should've came sooner! The entire lobby was packed! Luckily, a nice lady redirected us to a separate & much shorter line. She noticed we had our toddler in a stroller and as she said, ""saved 2 ours of our time"" SO THANKFUL FOR HELPFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

Check in was easy, service was great, & Justin even gave us a free upgrade. Our room was originally supposed to be 1 king bed, but instead we got 2 queens. He said it was a little bit bigger than the other room & I had no problem with that, since I read reviews that that room was small anyway. & it was a chance to see if our daughter wanted to sleep in her own bed lol. 

The room itself was clean, beds were comfortable, and had a fully stocked refrigerator. Don't touch the items inside, unless you plan on buying them because they do have a sensor! It's cool they have these options, but wish they didnt stuff them or left a little room for guests to store their own drinks or left over food. 

By the time we got up to the room, it was about 4:30, got changed and headed for the pool. Only to find out, they close at 5 :( 
So we went to go change and left to walk around the strip that night. Woke up early the next day to hit up the pool with the fam before checkout. Forgot to check the weather until we were halfway there and it was a little chilly! But the pool was a little heated and good enough for us to enjoy for a bit.

When we got back up to the room, the bathroom smelled like sewage. Not sure what caused it cause it wasn't like that they day\/night before. 

Overall, MGM is a good location, there is a lot to see and different attractions, like Top Golf or other hotels\/casinos that are easy to walk to. You won't be bored, & if you get tired you'll be in walking distance to take a nap. 

I liked that they also have a variety of fast food to chose from, when we didn't wanna opt for the buffet or more pricier restaurants.",0,0,0

Check in was a breeze. Sure there was a line, but it moved quickly and efficiently! The lady that checked me in was soooo nice and soooo helpful! I believe her name was Kanesha or Nanesha and she was great! I asked for a room to see the strip and she very pleasantly granted me that request. She answered all of my questions and guided me to my room, which is in the grand tower and it is just right. I have a very nice view of the strip, the room is clean and modern, no noise from the hallway. It's a big hotel but really I am excited to spend the next three nights here.

  Don't expect anything super exceptional here, but do expect to spend your extra cash.  I loved my 2 bedroom-south tower suite, but that was about it.  Valet is good, check in not too bad, express check out is great.  The cocktail waitress service is sketchy, (just not enough of them on the floor).  Sports book needs some personality.  And come on, only 1 drink ticket per $100 bet!  Most places will give you 2 for a $50.  The pool was good.  I had an issue with a 2 for 1 offer for KA (which I received as part of my stay offer).  After 15 minutes the best they said they could do was charge me for the most expensive tickets and then they would honor the 2-1... I laughed.  Nowhere in my offer did it say that.   (Just another example of how this place sucks the juice out of your wallet)   Box office sent me to M Life to see what they could do.  The rep (Jan) was rude and unaccommodating.  Kept telling me they only did 30% off while I tried to show her my 2-1 email on my phone, but of course she didn't want to read it.  She had me speak to someone on the phone who apologized and basically said NOPE.  Finally just had to walk away while Jan was still going on and on...Very scammish.  Stay away from Wolfgang Pucks (that's a WHOLE diff story!)  Tried the ""real"" fitness center but they wanted an extra $10 per day to use it, and that's on top of the dreaded $25 per night resort fee.  The ""fake"" fitness center was free but only had cardio equip.  Slots don't play or pay with you (as most of the MLife casinos).   As for stays, this place is a one and done for me.",0,0,0

The hotel is smokey and smelly in a stinky 'lets spray lots of perfume to cover up this smell' kind of way.
 My room was musty and moldy. 
The shower head sprayed the water out so damn hard I swear I got bruises. 
There wasn't a fan in the bathroom in my room, no night light in the room either and also no robe, which I was really sad about...I like to lounge around hotel rooms in a robe. 
The bed was super comfortable though, nice and gushy with soft cool sheets. 

The Grand Buffet was a horrible rip off.  Thankfully (for me) my friend paid, but for the $27 she paid for my meal I would have much rather eaten Mexican food at Diego and paid the difference in cost. The buffet food was awful...it was full of fatty oil, salty, and just down right nasty.  My friend loved the buffet,  so I guess it just depends on who's eating. 

The pool area is HUGE, it spans over 6 acres. I think there are six pools to choose from, but none of them are European which I prefer so that kinda bummed me out too. 

What especially did the whole pool experience in for me was the drunk guy that threw up in the pool -he should have been cut off as he was obviously shit faced, but instead the waitress kept serving him and his buddies, then he got sick... right in the pool. They had to shut it down at that point. 

So I guess what it comes down to is I'm spoiled. I like my night light, and my robe...I don't care for buffets or drunks puking next to me while I'm in the pool. The stay wasn't all bad but I don't think I will seek out the MGM for a future stay in Las Vegas.",2,2,1

It is a long walk from parking to registration to room, but once we got checked in and settled, it was better.  The hotel (resort) has everything you need so in theory you could stay there the whole trip and feel like you had a great vacation.  It's in a good location and a quick walk to NYNY or even Excalibur to get on the tram to Mandalay.  It is within walking distance to several shops and quick bite (ie fast food) restaurants, which is nice when you're not trying to be too fancy.  
We mostly played poker, and it was a good time.  The staff and dealers were all very nice and both my husband and I did well, which makes it hard to critize, but I will anyway.  My biggest beef is that the ""poker room"" is not a room.  It's a roped off spot on the side of the casino.  I wish it felt like poker players were more valued, but it is what it is.  
Other than that, we had a great stay.  The cafe made a mean club sandwich, I mean it was loaded with bacon and the bread was toasted just right.  Perfect.",1,0,1

The attendant asked if we were staying or playing so I says checking in. Dude says ""That will b $18 a night to valet"" and I was like WTF ""U serious"" he says ""Yup"". First off I was shocked, me & my family have been coming to Vegas for 15 plus years & stayed @ numerous hotels on the strip. And I get it it was an adjustment when the dreaded ""Resort Fees"" appeared and the increased steadily. ..fine I get it. But paying to stay when I am already paying to stay, smfh. So I says to the guys what r my options he says to.me u can self park for $10 a day...WTFx2. I park it myself and I still got to pay a 10 spot...what the hel* did I get into. So I park my own ride, smdh, and check in. The lady @ the counter was nice & when we asked about the ""Parking Fee"" she was like yeah oh uh huh yeah yup it $10. Plus the muther luving resort fee @ $34 a day. 

So we get the key and head to the room, I didn't know I was gonna have ro hire Louis and Clark to get to it. Finding the elevator was easy but had to walk a danged country mile to finally get to the room.

The room was...not $#!+. I guess they tried to make it look modern and up to date but believe they failed. The toilet\/shower area is all glass and closed in, rather small. The bedroom area is ok but for nearly $200 a night u would expect more and better. We have stayed @ Wynn, Aria, Luxor, Bellagio even TI and the rooms were bigger and they felt like u got what u paid for, here not as much. Hopefully the experience gets better.  If u r looking for value for ur money this joint ain't it. Not only to u pay to stay the night  but u will do that 2 more times. Once for the resort fee and the other to park. I don't know if this is a trend w\/ the other hotels or not but this is not a good way to do buisness.

The hotel is huge every day my friend and I discovered a different part of the hotel which actually made it even more fun. We had a room in the grand tower (21st floor room 328) which we was told was in there newer tower. The view was simply amazing, The room was kept clean on a daily bases.Room service was awesome as well and everything tasted amazing. I went to the lobby bar one night and the bar and the selection of music by the dj was awesome he definitely kept it going. I ordered a vodka and it was strong just how I like it. We has two vouchers for the buffet which we took advantage of for dinner, love the fact that the crab legs was already cut... Depending on what you picked food wise it was hit or miss, The pizza, spring roll and garlic was amazing.

MGM has an impressive lobby with a huge golden lion statue in the middle.  Our check-in process went smoothly and the clerk, Mai, was really nice.  They have a special prima card you can purchase for $500 which allows you to use at MGM and their affliate hotels, restaurants.  It's a way to get you to spend all your dough at their facilities.  

Our rooms were nice, clean and the marbled art deco-ish bathrooms were really nice.  Complimetary jasmine scented shampoo, conditioner, bath wash and lotion bottles lined the counter.  I don't know how dudes deal with the jasmine scented stuff, but I liked it!   Our bed was very comfy but it was hard to sleep on the down pillows as I prefer the pillows to be firmer. 

MGM is home to Cirque du Soliel's KA show but as they were on ""vacation"", we couldn't get tickets.  There are several upscale restaurants and a Wolfgang Puck Cafe' on the main floor.  In the rear is a high-end Japanese restaurant, Emeril's restaurant, a Michael Mina seafood restaurant and 3 fast food places.  One for hot dogs, salads, the golden arches McD and an Italian\/pizza\/breakfast place.  Amble further down, you have a sandwich shop, CSI experience and a screening show.   
We didn't venture into the pool area which is another level lower, but I could see at least 2 pools but understand there's up to 5-6 pools and a gym somewhere.  What I like are the 2 Starbucks - one by the casino and one by the fast food places, both with long lines in the mornings.  

Take the escalator (by the front doors) downstairs to head to the garage and there are a few shops, ice cream, pretzels, a video shop where your head video is planted onto a dancing body (rather comic) and the popular footlong cocktails which is busy all day long.  There are 2 doors which exit right onto the Strip towards the back of the casino where there's a buffet, restaurant and Rainforest Cafe'.  They have a real lions' glass enclosure.  One day, we saw 2 adult females with their 3 trainers lying or sitting down next to them and on a 2nd day, there were 2 juveniles playing with their trainers.  Kinda sad to see these animals locked up.  I'd rather see the space used for more slots or restaurants insead of caged animals 'tho.",3,0,2

It is one of the nicer 4 star hotels in the lower price range and is part of a network of MGM corporate hotels in Vegas.  

MGM is large, but utilitarian in some respects.  Grand but some how compact. if you've never been to a Vegas hotel like Caesar's or Paris or Wynn or Venetian-- then you'll be very impressed here and with anything nearby it in comparison.  MGM was in many respects a high point in a line of hotels back in the 90s.  The hotel's thrill rides are gone today, but it's majesty remains, and low prices.

Pros-- 
a. Affordable, and sometimes very affordable
b. 3 nice large pools
c. lazy river (only weekends)
d. small mall inside
e. Quite a few entertainment and activities to purchase including KA, Jabba Woc Keez, David Copperfield, CSI, and more.  
f. Easy to purchase upgrade rooms at the front desk
g. Beautiful rooms, clean, and updated.
h. There's a great tram for $5 a trip or $10 a day that connects to the convention center.

Cons--
a. No microwaves in rooms, nor refrigerators and you can't get them either.
b. Rooms come with super expensive snacks w\/ $50 stocking fees and $5 soda's-- really bad if you have active kids. 
c.  You can feel lost or insignificant in the hotel, and you could be treated that way too.  
d.  There's no real feel that they are trying to make each guests experience great
e. There's a focus on up-selling at this hotel that is more than I've seen at other non-MGM hotels in Vegas. You can feel nickeled and dimed here. 
f. Because of the lazy river, there can be more families at this hotel.
*This is pretty much the same at all MGM resort properties. 

Tips: 
a. weekends are more money but have a lazy river open.   
b. Aria has a better buffet nearby that you can easily walk to
c.  Ka really is a great show and the best price will be in the hotel on the main floor at the box office. You will get cheaper and better seats this way no matter what the online site claims.

While this is a beautiful hotel, it's just not comparable and falls flat as a hotel, as a casino, and for it's location.  But that does make it cheaper than the others by about $50 to $100 per night. I recommend the others for more money as Vegas trips for many are once in a blue moon. While you can get the lazy river on weekends, the other hotels would be much closer in price on the north end of the strip and the experience would be far better.

I booked a Skyline Marquee Suite over a month before my wife's 30th birthday. I was thrilled to have a space to entertain the 15 guests I had attending from the local area and also staying in other rooms at the MGM. We planned to have dinner in the large room (with its two living rooms, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms) before heading downstairs.

Upon arrival on 9\/17\/16 around 4PM, Ricky informed me that they weren't able to honor the room choice and would instead have to downgrade me to a City View Suite (a much smaller room) and a regular room down the hall from it. 

I couldn't have been more disappointed. All the planning I had put into the location was rendered pointless because MGM stuck me in a tiny suite that was a joke for the entertaining that I had planned. I didn't have enough places to sit and had to apologize to my guests.

I understand that issues are going to come up but I would have expected an upgrade to a nicer room or a full refund when MGM isn't able to honor my room booking -- especially when it's a $1k+ suite. Ricky said it was due to a ""plumbing issue"" but forgive my skepticism that this was code for ""we decided to comp your room to a high-roller.""

The downgrade was bad enough but I was particularly put off by Ricky implying that he was doing me a favor by finding me a room at all. He gave me some money back but was unwilling to provide a full refund on the room that MGM didn't have for me. I didn't have time to find another solution since our guests were already en route (and the check-in process took 45 min). I felt some comfort in that Ricky promised that there would be a door between the living room and the bedroom, but (surprise, surprise) there was no door. I went back downstairs to inform Ricky and still no refund.

I thought about booking elsewhere (I've always had perfect experiences at The Venetian) but I stuck with MGM because I loved this room.

My fault for expecting them to save it for me.

UPDATE: See MGM's response for further proof that MGM won't refund when they can't deliver. Not your fault but not their problem!",10,0,1

Of all the casinos I could have gone to instead, I convinced myself that the MGM was the most practical choice, since I had played here before in years past and enjoyed it then. How wrong I was.
The poker lounge is no longer next to the sports book section. I'm assuming it was moved in an attempt to give it a more prominent identity and add character on to itself. Suffice to say they have failed miserably on both marks.
The lounge is poorly lit and there's a very depressing feel to it. The chairs are comfortable, but that's about as good as it gets.
After playing for about an hour, I found myself in a dispute with another player over the proper turns in action. The dealer did absolutely nothing to correct the situation, so I requested a floor manager to come help settle the problem. I stood up from my seat to wait for the floor manager to walk over and what happened next was the most unprofessional interaction I've ever had with someone at the management level. 
Two words into beginning to describe what was going on at my table I was rudely interrupted by the floor man who demanded me to ""sit down."" I responded with ""Excuse me?"", to which he again repeated ""sit down."" That was enough for me. I calmly gathered my chips and cashed out at the front booth of the room. That is where I met another poker lounge manager named Mark, who I believe was the floor man's boss. He did absolutely nothing to help quell the situation and seemed to reinforce his employee's complete and total lack of respect and professionalism towards a paying guest. 
I will never return to the MGM Grand to play poker. There are a bevy of options elsewhere in Vegas to play cards, so save yourself a terrible experience and avoid this poker area. Unless, of course, you enjoy being disrespected and treated as if you were a child.",2,0,0

So first time going to Vegas and we show up stand in line FOREVER! Seriously if it wasnt for the nice lobby with music videos playing I'd feel like I was at the DMV. After waiting at least 20+ minutes for just the 2 people checking in before us (yes only 2 people) we finally get to the counter to find out our reservations were cancelled for some unnamed reason. Wait, what? Why? Couldnt tell us why and of course nobody from the hotel called prior to just cancelling us... 

We ended up getting our reservation re-opened and moved to a closer room to our friends that were a floor above us. Which was fine since it was a nicer room than what we originally paid for. (Hence keeping a star for that) BUT I had to ask for it (aka play a little hardball), even though the woman at the desk said they dont do ""upgrades for free"" after getting our reservation cancelled and it being a birthday weekend she opted to help us out. So the delux king it was rather than a petite king. Cool, thanks... 

2nd star was for the decent room. It was a little dated but comfortable, nice large bathroom, comfy bed, decent view of the mountains... But thats about where it ended. I realize I was in Vegas and people are there to party... all night... But I couldnt believe that there was no hotel security or something of the like to keep people respectable in the hallways to the rooms. I'm sorry but when I am ready to sleep I dont appreciate people hooting and hollaring just outside our room, which pretty much sounded like they came right in our room to yell. The sound of people going to and from was actually pretty bad. Knowing I am a light sleeper and can get pretty grumpy when my sleep is interrupted I went to the over priced little store near the lobby\/elevators and purchased ear plugs. Those helped a lot and allowed me to get some decent sleep. I am very thankful that the little store carried them otherwise I'd not be doing very well. 

Ok lets talk about the pool area... Good Lord it was CROWDED! But with my group of people we stayed in the Lazy River and ended up having an awesome time despite there not being any chairs or place to sit near the pool itself. We did take over some tables by the food area and werent bothered by staff at all for leaving our stuff there so it was cool. I quickly learned that even though there were tons of people in a rather small area everyone got along. Normally big crowds and booze lead to stupidness but everyone was great, all there just to have a good time. So if you are hesitant to try the lazy river because of how many bodies are in it, try it anyway. It was a great way to spend 4 hours and beat the heat and humidity. 

Seriously our trip was full of high and low points... High point at check out was the gentlemen that checked us out was really nice and ended up comping us on a few things because of the hassel of what we went through with getting our $75 food credit that we got with our room with booking thru the hotel and for the random cancel... We appreciated him, but upon checking our credit card statement when we got home there are now some pending charges that we dont understand WHY they are there. When we called the hotel the lady that answered was incredibly rude to my husband and literally wouldnt let him finish a sentence to try and explain what we were seeing on our credit card statement. So we're opting to wait and see how those pending charges get handled and go from there... So beware when staying here. Make sure you check your statements after your stay...

Over all for the absolute hassel of staying at this place I probably wont be back unless we are with another group again. The Lazy River wasnt enough to make me want to spend my hard earned dollars here. *IF* I did come back I would most likely try the Signature instead. After reading their reviews it sounds more like what I'd appreciate in a room and they have their own check out staff that are probably less crowded. The place is huge and can get fairly confusing to try and get anywhere but after a few trips up and back we were finally able to get our bearings and navigate. 

Final thoughts... The MGM looks really nice, its a beautiful property but service leaves a lot to be desired and their rooms are needing the current renovation that they are doing. But, the construction thats happening (that we thankfully didnt hear unlike our friends that got woken up at 9am by jack hammering) I think they should close off many more floors so that when you roll into bed at 4am you dont get woken up at 9am. Its not like the MGM can't afford to do so...

Last year reservations made a crucial mistake that cost me about $100. I made a reservation for a Saturday, and even told the agent that I wanted the room for SATURDAY and she confirmed the numerical date as well. When I arrived on Saturday, they had no reservation for me. The front desk agent who had a thick Eastern European accent was in a rotten mood due to the guests who she serviced before me being very out-of-line and difficult. She was still steaming when I got to her and she had abandoned all of her customer service and hospitality skills. Eventually, she had found out that the reservation agent had made my reservation for Friday. I insisted that it was mistake and she shouts: ""WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING THIS TO ME TODAY?"". I could have interpreted the ""you people""  remark as a racist remark, but didn't know if that comment was due to the fact that English didn't appear to be her first language. Eventually she told me that she was not going to charge me for a no-show on Friday and that she could check me in. That turned out to be a complete lie. I didn't catch it until recently, but I was looking though some bank statements and noticed that she in fact did charge me as a no-show. 

The casino floor is not that much better. I played blackjack for 4-6 hours a day, betting about $50 a hand for about two weeks in a row here, and my rewards card still has a comp balance of $0.00. I believe that this is one of those casinos where they do that Vegas style ""age discrimination"". Many Vegas casinos do not like to comp young people who are in their 20s, no matter how big they bet. They like to comp the geriatrics and seniors even though they may only play penny slots. There is no real rational reason why they do this but remember that since the corporations took over Vegas, they have been losing revenue due to their marketing department being full of unqualified pretty girls and trust fund babies whose Dad's had connections to get them in. 

I still would like to point out that the people who work at the gift shops are very nice and polite, and the dealers are all very qualified to work at such an upscale establishment. But, next time I have guests in town who I want to impress, I will absolutely never check them in at the MGM.",3,4,1

We usually prefer to stay at Mirage, for the central-Strip location and the familiarity -- there's no need to get reoriented on every trip. However, the group we were traveling to meet in mid-November had planned to stay at MGM  (way down on the south side of the Strip). It's in the Mirage group, so at least our points would still add up (gotta earn that free buffet, yo!). So we booked our MGM reservation and looked forward to hanging out with some friends while exploring a new scene. Alas, there was a last minute change of plans and somehow we wound up being the only couple in the group staying at MGM and I was NOT going to spend $200 to change our hotel booking via Southwest Vacations (Note to self: splurge on the trip insurance whenever traveling with a fickle large group).

Big plus: 
You can check-in at the airport and walk straight to your room, key-in-hand. I loved breezing past the masses waiting at the hotel desk.

We had reserved a West Wing mini-suite, and it was at the end of the longest hallway on earth, 5th floor. I'm pretty sure I walked about 25 miles every time I left the room to go to the casino or anywhere else. Lord, don't these architects know that women are wearing some very high heels in this town (strictly for looking hawt while sitting or standing still, possibly for limited dancing) and we do NOT want to trudge around for hours in them?  Big plus: the hallways upstairs are very cushion-y, so off went my shoes each time I exited the elevator... squish, squish, squish, ahhhh, better.

The room, the good: 
We loved the super clean & comfy bed and modern decor, including the fun TV built into the bath vanity mirror. There's no tub, but there is a huge shower with body jets. Lots of floor-to-ceiling mirrors in the corners of the bedroom make the space appear much larger than it is. The closet is roomy enough that all your stuff can be easily contained and the room doesn't have to look like a campsite.

The room, the bad: 
There were a few loose screws holding things together in the bath\/vanity area (where 90% of everything is glass -- kind of noisy and privacy-inhibiting). On our last night, a breaker must have tripped and we lost electricity in the bath area, so we had no light in there for getting ready & packing up the next morning.  Worst of all, the ventilation system seems to mix all the air from the surrounding rooms, so if your neighbors are smoking or ordering room service, you get to smell every associated odor.  I did NOT need to smell that meaty big breakfast at 8am following a night of ""Fear & Loathing"" proportions....

The service: 
I had been especially looking forward to the king crab leg feast in the Friday night buffet (the only night during our trip it would be available) and was quite upset when we arrived at the site only to find they had closed 45 minutes early (especially after huffing it across the 100 miles of hallways to get there).  I called the concierge to give them a piece of my mind, but before I could even get started, I was comped a $75 room credit to use at any of the other MGM restaurants.  Sweet!  Then, after a final night of overindulgence, I was in pitiful shape and we were in danger of missing our checkout & flight times. One brief call to the concierge and we were quickly on our way to a private car that got us to the airport in plenty of time (and luckily, with no barf bag required to be employed). After I arrived home, I realized that a very precious-to-me pair of heirloom earrings had been left behind on the dark vanity; I was sure I'd never see those again, but they had been turned in by cleaning services to the lost & found and were shipped back to me within the week. Thank you, MGM! I will never forget how well you took care of me when I was in need.

Other things we loved about the MGM:
+iPhone app with tons of info about what to do in the hotel. The place is gigantic, so it's nice to have all the info easily accessible in an interactive format.
+Hanging out in the laid-back hot-tub in the afternoon and chatting with fellow Texans in town for a joint bachelor-bachelorette party.

The Grand Tower rooms are beautiful and spacious; these were recently remodeled and are 100 sq ft larger than the West Wing rooms. They're also located closer to the pool area, the lobby and to the MGMs underground which is a huge plus! 
The pool area alone is big enough to get lost in, the lazy river is amazing but I wish the hours of it were the same as the rest of the pool area.
Every employee I encountered was super helpful and friendly.

In short, the MGM has no affiliation with Studio 54 and I was told by the front desk that the MGM lies to its guests and doesn't uphold promotional offers. I refused to think that the hotel was this bad so after complaining I got a comp for a free weekend. I took advantage this weekend and would rather have paid to stay somewhere else.

I'm used to the mandatory resort fee that offers internet and business center access. However, the business center makes you pay for computer use and $1.40 per page to print. Thanks, that's really helpful. Want to go to the gym? That's another $15 per day. Fine I'll just go to my room and ignore all of the inconveniences. 

My room smelt like sewage. This wasn't ever fixed. That's ok because Studio 54 put me on the guest list to make up for the last time! Wrong. They had no record of that. Of course they didn't. We went to Haze nightclub in the Aria instead and had a blast so maybe it was for the best.

Your mind plays out a wealthy fantasy in your head and you're so ready to tap the shoulder of any random person and proclaim, ""I'm Rich, Biotch!!""

Instead, you look into your wallet and sigh... But no worries, there are plenty of opportunities to earn some $$$ back. The casino in this hotel is pretty huge. I just remember being tired walking through it just to get to the elevators. Long night out? Drunk? Who knows. 

Now the funny thing was seeing kids running around the casino at 10pm. Hahah. 

It looks like a small hotel from the lobby, but if you find yourself in the belly of the MGM beast, you will soon find yourself in another zip code. It's HUGE in here!  

Oh man.. I felt like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz: disoriented and lost. No wonder this was originally the Oz hotel. Where were my magic ruby slippers? It took me an entire hour to find my way back to familiar grounds. Where the hell was I? 

There is a grand ballroom of sorts, an underground shopping center where I tried some slushy alcoholic drink, the live lions, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and others, a pool area, several clubs and bars, and a whole mess of other stuff to do and see. 

They have the KA Cirque du Soleil show here, and famous acts that come here to perform. 

Yes, this is a great hotel, and from our room, we could see the sun rising behind some mountains in the distance. Sooo beautiful. I couldn't forget the view that morning before going to bed. 

On a side note, the hallway to our room was so damn long, it reminded me of the hallway in The Shining. 

The missing star is due to the clogged toilet and the 2 hours it took for the maintenance people to arrive and fix the darned thing.

My friend was overcharged 3 separate times on her credit card, each time being told no one could see the charges she very clearly saw on her card. She spent over 3 hrs in person and on the phone trying to resolve these charges and she is still fighting. She was also told her initial deposit of $250 would not be credited to her account.

Be warned...the staff will tell you one thing and you may get something entirely different.  We were told a strip view but ended up with a east view looking down Tropicana.  The room was clean and we had plenty of towels and such.

In a large hotel like this, you're definitely treated like a number and that's the way they make you feel.  Typical for the huge hotels in Vegas.  So sad actually because their prices are extremely high for what you get and the service you get.  Which is poor.

The room and floor attendants were excellent.

The pool is very very nice.  Go strip down to your swimsuits and enjoy the hot sun by the water.  Cocktail!  : - )

I don't recommend you do Valet parking if you don't have to.  The wait to get your vehicle on check out time is absolutely incredible.  I'm glad we didn't do valet as they suggested.  The walk from the parking structure is a long ways to the elevators to the rooms.  Security is constantly patrolling all the floors on the parking structure.  They get around pretty quickly on the bicycles.

I've seen the KA show now 5 times.  This last time...on July 17th...I was totally let down.  What a poor cast and poor performance.  I've never seen such a pathetic group of performers in the previous 4 shows.  What happened to this show and the previous cast!  DO NOT GO SEE KA!  For the money, we, the customer expect performance.  Something that makes you go.....aaawwww!  Wow!  I was actually furious at what I was watching.  What a let down to the key performers that were still there like the Mexican guys on the wheel.  They're consistently good.  More on this part of the review later.  I want my money back!  Jerks! to you Cirque du Soliel for a poor job!  You guys should know better and now it appears you're taking advantage of the general public by placing less experienced performers on the stage.  I'll address that with Cirque separately.  Not letting this go for the money I spent.

Although, the rooms were clean and safe...I just can't get past giving this hotel more than one star.  There's a few little things they can do to make this experience so much more for their guests.  Too bad more of the customers don't demand more for their money.

Overall there were a lot of plus sides to the MGM:

+ pretty easy to get anywhere else on the strip 
+ newly renovated rooms aren't amazing, but they're nice. Not a big deal since we only slept\/showered in them anyway.
+ they seem to always be having some kind of promotion sale which brings down the overall price
+ there are a LOT of pools and it was nice to always have options
+ there was a food court that served food quickly which I appreciate when I've been doing nothing but having fun in the sun all day

But the negatives include:

- it's gigantic and easy to get lost
- the water pressure was pretty low and that's something I personally hate
- the big attraction to MGM for me was the lazy river. But the lazy river doesn't require the intertubes, so a lot of people just end up walking in the river. Kinda sucks for people that do get the intertubes hoping to just lounge inside of a tube, only to constantly run into people standing, having to get out of the tube to hold it up and get around, etc. It ends up not being worth it at all - why have a lazy river if you can't use it properly?!
- no robes? :(
- despite the promotional sale, I'm not sure it's worth the price to stay because it's really not THAT amazing

So really, overall it's just A-OK. It works.

The one thing that made my review a 4 star instead of a 3 star though was the customer service. I had some issues with my bank blocking my card and I had to get on the phone and get it figured out. The front desk was incredibly accommodating, friendly and helpful taking care of it and I appreciated it. Even the cleaning crew was cheery and greeted us anytime we walked by. Every person at the hotel that I talked to had a smile on their face and was really nice.

They were also really amazing when we arrived back to the hotel one night and my girl who had a little too much. They brought out a wheelchair for her so we didn't have to carry her to her room!  That's pretty awesome of them to do!",4,2,0

Boy, do I hate it when they add that $30 ""resort fee"" on top of listed prices.  How is that legal?  It's not just this hotel; many of them do that.

The valet service was fast and efficient, as was check-in process.  Folks were super friendly, so they definitely do that right.  Because of the price, we got a room without any view.  You get what you pay for, so that's okay.  You don't really go there to look out of the room window anyway.  

I did have to work a bit while I was there, so the free wi-fi is a huge plus. I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the connection.  I learned that you really have to work in the room if you want peace and quiet.  There is NO WHERE else in the hotel where it's quiet enough for a phone call.  Even their business centers are open air, so people yelling, slot machines just fill the air.  Even the hallways have blaring overhead music.  I even tried the garage at one point and realized there was loud music there too.  

As for the rest of the hotel, it really is showing its age. Everything is kind of dark. The decorations could use some refreshing.  The tables have a minimum of $10 in the morning, so that's good if you're not a heavy gambler.

Check-out was easy as they offer different ways of doing it.  You can even text message or email your check-out.  I was impressed by this.

They were pretty quick about checking us in we had a hard time finding the elevator up to our room because, it is a big overwhelming if you are not use to it plus it was our first time.

We finally asked one of the casino floor people where the west wing elevators were, We were directed over to them we walked through this long hallway then finally there were the elevators. We go up to our floor and the elevator talks lol.. Something else I was not use too.. We exited onto our floor.

The room was absolutely awesome, Everywhere had mirrors, the furniture was so modern and nice. the mirrors were actually closets as well you push in the mirror and out it pops to open. It was pretty neat.

Also there was a tiny window which over looked the vegas strip, which I thought was so neat.

Bed oh so comfy ! feathered pillows!..

Once we dropped off our bags we went back downstairs to see what we could get into. The casino floor is pretty packed at night of course, If you sit at a machine long enough you will eventually get asked if you want a drink.. Good luck however I had a hard time getting a drink.

Although check in was kinda slow, she did comply to all my requests of wanting a non-smoking room as well as one located closer to the elevator. I do not like those rooms where you have to walk a marathon to get to.

The valet parking is pretty efficient also. The valets are very friendly and will help you with directions. In fact, they always ask you if you need directions to get some where. Our only problem was asking them to recommend places to go to -- which, most of the time, they would give us some weird place which we wouldn't even go to in California. Oh well.

The casino is also well ventilated, although you can still smell the smoke. I guess that's inevitable. However I do like the fact that you can bypass the casino and walk through another corridor to get to the elevators. We stayed here because we got a really great deal, and I would definitely stay here again if we got a great deal again.",5,0,2

On our last trip, we found ourselves in MGM and enjoyed the experience so much that we felt compelled to write about it.  We hung out at the casino bar at the wee hours of the morning and the experience was fantastic.  We were thoroughly entertained by the bartender, who had us laughing all night (morning?).  The only thing better than the entertainment was the Bloody Marys (I wish I could remember the bartender's name, something with a D...just look for the bartender that looks just like Kevin James from King of Queens).  It was nice to find a friendly bartender in a town filled with d-bags working the bar.  Anyway, we topped off the night by eating at the cafe, which was a little on the pricey side, but hey, thats Vegas.  Food was decent and hit the spot after a long night on the town.  We will definitely be staying at the MGM on our next trip thanks to ""Kevin James's"" great service and sales pitch for the hotel!",0,0,0

Rooms have improved. We enjoyed the size, decor and view from our room. It was very clean. Check-in\/check out is busy as you would expect with such a large hotel. You can beat it with good timing and use of bell service.

The 1st night it really bothered me but each day it got better and the last 3 days I didn't notice it. 

The room was great. I had a double bed room and it was pretty large and very updated. The blackout shades worked wonders. I kept thinking it was 3 am when it was 9am. The bathroom was perfect, lower the shower. 

I only ate here a few times. Project Pie was fantastic, and a few places in the food court, meh, but good enough for a late night snack. I was not a fan of the yogurt place. 

I did see David Copperfield and he was great. My bf got choosen to help in an act on stage and that was amazing.

We stayed in one of the ""Celebrity Spa"" suites because they were practically giving them away.  The decor looks very well used and could use some updating.

A warning if you're considering this much larger room:  most, if not all, of them have connecting doors (for ""families,"" we were told!) to an adjoining room which leak noise profusely.  This made for some unpleasant experiences with our party-focused neighbors.

The large whirlpool spa tub made up for a lot of that, though.  The bathroom was huge.  The bed was fairly comfy.  Nothing to rave about, but not much to complain about, either.  We'll stay here again if we don't want to break the bank on Bellagio or Wynn.",0,0,0

It is located fairly centrally. A 10 minute walk to Luxor, 20 min walk to Bellagio, grab a cab\/RTC bus\/ Monorail for Palazzo on down. You will do a lot of walking. That being said it is connected via bridge to NYNY and I believe Tropicana (we saw a walkway but didn't actually use so I could be wrong here).

The rooms are fine- nothing spectacular and maid service was not consistent. One day our maid would come at 4pm the next 9 am ...so I didn't love that. For the price it is a value and is certainly clean. The beds were very comfortable. The place itself is absolutely huge. Overall I thought the hotel was in very nice condition with the exception of an extremely outdated entrance. Other than that the pools were beautiful and brand new and I couldn't complain at all. 

Dining options are great and span very high-end Michelin Star earning Joel Robuchon all the way down to good ol' Micky D's (and yes they have the dollar menu). We ate at Wolfgang Pucks which I thought was one of the better Italian options I had on the trip. We also ate at Shabuya which has above average sushi but is a bit pricy so be prepared to drop a bit of cash there. I liked Tom Colicchio's wichcraft for a nice lunch that isn't terribly overpriced in my opinion. They also have decent pizza that is open late night. We tried their Buffet at lunch and that was pretty decent as well.  

Nightlife was fun, especially if you are a girl - we were able to drink for free at both Studio 54 and Tabu. Studio 54 was a MUCH older crowd the night we were there so we didn't love that one as much but free is free. 

My only real issue was with the concierge service. First let me say that attractiveness is not a requirement for me in this dept. I just need someone to KNOW what they are talking about. While she was beautiful she had no idea about the bus routes which is a pretty important thing to know for her job. Once we asked her to look around for a brochure she happily opened it for us and pointed at a few things.

We used the check in at the airport to get a start on the visit. That's handy so you can avoid any lines at the font desk on the property. 

We had one of the remodeled rooms and compared to our previous stays, this decor is much nicer. Love the HD TV. Bed was very comfortable and we slept like logs except for one night when some drunks were arguing in the hall. A call to the front desk quickly brought security and an end to the commotion. 

The ""resort fee"" is basically just a way of disguising the true room rate but they do make it clear it is mandatory as does every other place in Vegas AFAIK. The wifi worked fine except for having to resign in every day, a minor nuisance. 

My wife was very disappointed the Lion Habitat is gone and replaced with Brad Garret's Comedy Club. He is now on her S$&t list. OTOH, I now have options for other hotels in Vegas since the Lions were the main reason we chose the MGM in the past. 

The MGM is OK but we will be making a different choice next time, perhaps the Bellagio. Even if we do stay at the Bellagio, we will definitely visit the MGM for Wolfgang Puck's Grill were the service is superb and the food is great. 

MGM is OK but considering the sometimes long walks to the room (not this time thanks very much), we will try another MGM Mirage property.",0,0,0

---Room---
We stayed in the Low-end room and it was still pretty nice. 

Pros: you get a little couch to chill on. Nice touch. A\/C and a pretty decent view. Bed was pretty comfortable. 

Cons: No flat screen TV (Wasn't trippin), no Mini bar or Mini fridge (maybe I could have asked for one?), Shower was typical motel shower - not very relaxing. 

---Food---

Pros: Lots to choose from whether you're in the mood for something quick and cheap or five star dining. 

Cons: Tough to find vegetarian friendly food here (or anywhere on the strip as we found), even the cheap dining wasn't that cheap!

---Bars\/Lounges---

Pros: 2 or 3 of the bars here were open all night. One was Crazy Horse, I don't remember the other ones... Drinks were strong, the bartenders were pretty chill. 

Cons:  Drinks are EXPENSIVE! 10 to 12 bucks for a Long Island, 8 bucks for a Whisky Sour, 6 or 7 bucks for a beer... Also most of the crowd I'd say were in the 30's-40's range. Didn't see a whole lot of 20-somethings (Maybe they were in Tabu ULTRA LOUNGE, who knows...) Oh and be warned, if you order a Jagerbomb, they'll pour you a Jager + redbull. No bomb involved whatsoever. 

Oh - Definitely check out Fat Tuesday. It's the only place in the hotel with cheap drinks. They get you faded!!

---Casino--- 

Pros: Massive. Lots of bright shiny things to amuse you and\/or take your money :p 

Cons: ATMs have a $5.00 fee. ouch. I had another con but I forgot. Will update later :p

---Location---
Pros: Walking distance from NYNY, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Flamingos, Bellagio, Ceasars, etc... Theres a monorail that you can take to get towards the other end of the strip. I think it was 12 bucks for a 24 hour round trip pass.  

Cons: Can't think of any!

Thankfully, these strangers that came into our room (while we were still in the room) did no harm to us.  The security guards that we talked to afterwards were shocked that the hotel would allow our security to be violated.

When the hotel gave our room to another set of customers, they did not change bed sheets.  How did I know this?  My fiance cut her finger, and her finger bled inside the bed sheets.  There were blood stains in the bed sheets.  The hotel gave our room to different customers, and did not even change the bed sheets.

My fiance called the front desk, and the front desk said that our reservation was confirmed until Monday. AAA travel never received a phone call from the hotel.  We were booked from Sept 14th, 2012 to Sept. 17the 2012.  We paid AAA in advance on Aug. 22nd, 2012.  This led to our safety, property, privacy, and security being threatened.  In addition, they were going to charge us for another day.  When we were checking out by phone, the hotel said that they were going to charge us for another day because were booked until Sunday.  This was strange because the front desk said on Saturday that our reservation was confirmed through Monday.  They put us on hold, and we had to leave without talking to the supervisor because we were going to miss our flight home.

We explained that we were embarrassed, shocked, and upset that they would give other people access to our room.

We also explained our concern for our property if we were not in our room.  If we were not in our room, they could have stolen our property.  We also explained that these complete strangers invaded our privacy, and this is our get-away.  This was my birthday weekend.  She dismissed these concerns as only a CLERICAL ISSUE.  I told her, ""No, it's not just a clerical issue.  It's a safety issue because we could have been robbed, a liability issue because our property could have been stolen, and a privacy issue because this is our vacation that we paid for.""
 
Her Response: COULD HAVE, WOULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE. NOTHING HAPPENED.
 
I am a paying customer, and you are paying customers.  You pay for customer service.  Does this hotel really care about it's customers?  Do you want to go a hotel that give access of your room to strangers? Do you want to go to a hotel that does not change their bed sheets between customer, or cleans its rooms between customers? Do you want to go to a hotel that lies to you, and charges you extra fees while they lie to you?  Do you want a hotel that only cares about you AFTER you get robbed, hurt, or killed? (Shouldn't they protect your privacy, security, property, and safety before this happens?)
 
We paid a lot of money for this trip. Do you want to pay that much money for these breaches in privacy, security, property, and safety?
 
Imagine if a hotel would give it's customer quality service.  Imagine that.",0,0,0

The MGM Grand Casino is great, the poker tables are comfortable and the dealers are awesome (got one bad one out of maybe 40 dealers? nice!). But their service leaves a lot to be desired, I was accused of stealing $150 from the cashier! After waiting a half hour for them to ""review the tapes"" they found nothing to exonerate me, yet said ""oh sorry for the inconvenience, we don't think it was you..."" wait, what? So they accused me of stealing, then said they don't think it was me, even though the ""tapes show nothing"". There are at least a dozen cameras at the cashier's cage, they should have shown SOMETHING! 

Really, this wasn't so bad, but after being shaken, I couldn't gamble in my right mind... I asked to be notified once the issue was ultimately resolved ""don't you want my room number and hotel?"" I asked... ""we know who you are and where you're staying"" they replied.. yikes, but you can't find $150? 

They shouldn't have even bothered me with this.

We booked a suite in the Stay Well section of the hotel.  We arrived at the hotel a bit early and it wasn't a problem.  We walked into the Stay Well Lounge and we were greeted with cucumber water during our check in and we were immediately checked into our suite.  I highly recommend the City View Suite.  We did not have to wait in that long check in line that i saw as we walked into the lobby.  When we arrived in our suite  OMG, purified water, air filters, no smoke smell, no dust, turndown service, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne...I could go on and on, but that would be bragging.  Well in that case, let me go on and on...We wanted to see KA on a night that was sold out and the concierge made it happen, he also made our dinner reservations for us.  

Everyone from our the housekeeping staff (they leave a note for you so you know who your housekeepers are), to the concierge, to the black jack dealer were so friendly and kind.  They almost made me forget that I lost a bunch of money during my stay...lol.

We'd been to Vegas before and just had never made it down to the Canyon. So we booked one night at the Mandalay Bay suite, one night in the Grand Canyon, and one night at the MGM Grand. (We booked different hotels in Vegas to try the different suites).

The day before our trip, it snowed twelve inches at the Grand Canyon. We knew the weather was going to be hit and miss with it being December, but we didn't know it would snow that bad. So we cancelled the Grand Canyon night and booked another night at MGM to replace it.

When we got to the MGM I knew it would be a little confusing - us having two separate reservations for two nights in a row. But since we had booked the same suite, the guy who checked us in said it would be no problem. He called a manager over to make sure the room keys would work both days, and we were good to go!

Then the problems started. 

The next morning, our room key didn't work when we came back to the room after breakfast. Not a big deal, that's happened before. The guy at the front counter fixed it for us and we were on our way. Then, when we got back to the room, room service knocked on the door. We said, ""please come back later,"" and they said (in a really rude voice), ""When are you leaving?!"" When we replied ""tomorrow"" they apologized and didn't realize we were staying another night.

Ten minutes later, one of the hotel staff members comes up to our room to ask us what we're doing there. We explain we have paid for two nights and that they were separate nights, so there might have been confusion. He apologized and went back downstairs.

That night, we booked two shows back to back. One was at a different hotel, and one was at the MGM. In between shows we went back to the room to change and go to the bathroom. Except for our room keys didn't work again. Got those fixed, then went to our second show.

After the second show, went back to our room and once again we couldn't get in since our keys didn't work. Staff didn't really seem to care all that much.

It's funny, because Mandalay Bay was great (and is owned by MGM or so I've read). But our experience here just was not good. Might have been a one time thing, but I've just had better experiences at other Vegas hotels so I would not stay here again.",0,0,0

I was told that it had been overhauled (mainly their rooms), and figured I should stay here. Overall, I booked because it was pretty cheap and was probably cheap since it was a bit far from all the shopping and good restaurants--which I'm not accounting for on this review since I did book that knowingly.

Problem #1:
I initially booked a room @ $133\/night during labor day weekend. I walked into this room with my girlfriend and the room look disgusting. My girlfriend advises people to watch American Horror Story: Hotel...and compare...very similar to that, she describes. The room looked somewhat rundown, sink looked like it had mold...I wish I would've taken pictures...sorry. I honestly have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express, and that room looked 100x better! To also add...their online picture of this room is deceiving!

15-20mins after we had checked in, I called concierge to have me upgraded. They upgraded me to a larger room...which was slightly nicer. I also have to add that I told concierge about how ""shi***"" the room was...and all they said was ""yeah, I know...sorry""...and said they could upgrade me to the larger room for $15 more a night.

Problem #2:
Housekeeping was also poor. Not sure why the hotel has to be stingy on the towels\/shampoo etc. I had one incident where I called housekeeping to clean my room. I was gone for 3 hours just to come back to it not being cleaned. I had to call housekeeping again to tell them it had not been cleaned and if they could send more towels\/shampoo etc. No apologies were given for this--almost felt like they didn't give a s***.

Only positive note: My girlfriend liked the room service cheese pizza selection!

Problem #3:
Who the f*** puts a fridge in a room, fills it up so you can't cool anything? And if you alter the fridge..meaning trying to add my water to cool it...they automatically charge you $50 for that. Oh! AND...if you do want a fridge to cool your items...they charge you $25\/day for it!! Thanks MGM. ALSO TO ADD...no coffee maker on the room!

Problem #4?:
Also not sure if this normal...but I had to put a $300 deposit...$100\/night.


TL; DR
Cheap rooms are shi**y and outdated. No complimentary upgrade, had to pay $15\/night more.

Housekeeping sucks and stingy with the towels\/shampoo etc.

Amenities in the room are below average!

However, what my friends and I didnt expect was all the issues we had in getting our room and keeping our room. Their systems were down so there was a long wait, but when we were finally assigned a room we were upgraded, which was nice until my friends went up and found out there was already a guy in there. So fine, mistakes happen, we were then downgraded back to the originally booked room, but our keys didn't work. Then after FINALLY getting into the room, a random stranger tried getting into our room telling us MGM assigned him to ours. Good thing we were inside the room, what would've happened if we were gone and strangers had taken our stuff? We left, had a bite to eat, and came back to find our keys not working AGAIN.

Service was a little slow for checking in at 3 am and surprisingly the line was pretty long. We originally booked our room for 2 nights but were only charged for one night...I'm assuming for the late\/early check-in. We were also upgraded (for no extra charge) to a 2 queen suite. Bonus!

Check-in: Despite a long line it moved VERY quickly and everything was in order when I did check into my room. I did arrive an hour earlier than their regular check-in time but, believe me when I say being nice to the person at the front desk paid off this time around. I was able to get to the room early and actually got an upgrade for a small fee ($40).

Room: I was suppose to stay in the West Wing but, I got upgraded to the Celebrity Suite. I almost never felt like leaving my room the second I stepped foot inside. The whirlpool tub was just another added bonus.

Food: A wide selection from fine dining to casual places like the Rainforest Cafe all provided a totally different experience each strictly distinct from food to decor. The one thing in common was the level of good service provided in each restaurant.

Pool: The Lazy River is as far as I got because I didn't need to go any further. Rent a tube and order an adult beverage and the river does the rest. I was there for roughly 2 1\/2 - 3 hours without even noticing the time.

Shows: I don't do too much in the way of clubs while I'm in Vegas rather I enjoy the wide selection of shows that Vegas provides. I saw KA which I enjoyed a lot, not as good as ""O"" when I went to see it at the Bellagio but KA was unique and pleasing in it's own way.

Gaming: Easy to find a table as well as slots. The poker room had a decent sized wait but, I just waited at the sports book for my turn to come up. After losing around $400 I made way to my luckier spots Bally's and the Paris casino's.

Check-out: I actually found it hard to leave on my scheduled checkout date so I stayed an extra night. When I finally did make my way to the front desk check-out went smoothly and quickly.

I would stay here just based on the amenities and service. It's not too flashy but, it's location and service are always worth staying at the MGM.",4,1,1

They have a nice streamlined process for check-in and check-out.  Makes things a lot easier, especially for check-out when all you want to do is get out of Vegas as quickly as possible.

It's one of the busier hotels and is in a nice location relative to other places.

The day after check in, the woman at the stay well desk by the name Sandy stops me and tells me that I have to pay $40 extra for each child per night.

Got into a big line and waited as a 'guest list' invitee to get into the club and was finally in there when I got assaulted by another guest who was crazy drunk but was a memeber of the 'VIP LIST'. While trying to understand what happened and defend myself I had my arm twisted behind my back and was escorted out of the club before any questions asked. In the 'back stairs' I was rudely asked to explain myself and had little chance to answer while being interrogated by an impatient staff. I was sober and had very little to drink but that didn't seem to stop their rude behavior. After many minutes another staff member came in and showed the 'head of security?' The video footage of what had happened. He immediately backed downs and said the girl who assaulted me was being escorted out of the club and 'what else did I want them to do about the subject?' I have an scratched eye and sore arm from being forced out and not for one second that person thought of apologizing for how his staff treated me and acted superior to me the entire time. This is sad and outrageous. I seriously doubt anything was actually done to the girl who assaulted me and when I asked why did they simply tell her to get out when they saw she assaulted me and I might've wanted to call the cops and have the matter handled properly they said it wasn't their job. But man handling me apparently was. Careful girls... Not a place you want to be at if help is needed and you are not a VIP. Also not one female member on the security team in case you need one. This morning I tried to talk to the head of security to the hotel and all I got was the number to the security service they use for the night club.... No one is responsible for this apparently,1,0,0

At check in we were told about an upgrade to a remodeled tower room for just over $20 a night and how much newer and bigger these rooms were. As I didn't stay in the West Wing I can't vie for how they look but I was very disappointed in the upgraded room. 

I am not sure when this remodeling took place but the fact they charged for it is incredible. The grout was peeling off our shower walls and was dirty. There was a large ring around the floor under our toilet and the walls were PAPER THIN. So thin we could hear our neighbors pull the blind string up and down each time. And you heard any door being knocked on in a few door radius. Not to mention the sounds of people all night long. I get this is Vegas and a party town. But when you get woken up several times from 2am to 5am from people talking in their rooms or walking up and down the hallways you quickly realized this hotel was not built for the town its in. I have stayed in many hotels and even in the cheapest never had the amount of sound issues we did in this one. And at the price they charge its enough we will be looking to stay somewhere else on our next trip. 

If you are heading to Vegas I suggest finding a hotel that provides a room that lives up to their rates.",1,0,0

We stayed here before several years ago and didn't consider it to be too bad, and since we wouldn't be in our room much, we didn't need anything fancy.

We are staying in the West Wing, which I definitely don't recommend. The vanity in our bathroom is incredibly tiny - there is almost no room to put out one's things. The cords from styling tools knock everything onto the floor because the counter is so ridiculously narrow. We are constantly having to pick our things up and it's just plain silly.

Our first morning here, after a long and restless night on an uncomfortable mattress, I dragged myself into the shower to revive myself before a day of classes. The water was barely lukewarm and left me shivering the entire time. My husband decided to forgo the shower all together, which wasn't ideal. We reported it to the front desk and they seemed concerned and said someone would come fix it. By the time we came back from our convention, the hot water was restored.

Today, as I was trying to get ready for dinner, I went to wash my hands. No water. I tried the shower. No water. I called the front desk AGAIN and was told that there had been an emergency shut off of the hot water and that it should be restored soon. Lovely.

I would have given two stars, but my husband said that he feels like this is usually a decent place and we're just having a bad run AND that we should avoid the West Wing if we ever stay here again. I will say that the room is clean and we were allowed to check in early (for a fee) which I appreciated. So, three stars.

Intro: Check-in went pretty smooth and no issues. Hotel layout is very strange though and there is a very long walk from one thing to the other. it could have been designed better. 

Room detail (negative): The room itself looked very nice and had a nice feel to it. However, the rooms lack a mini fridge and microwave to reheat stuff and also there is no coffee pot in the room as well. WARNING: DO NOT USE THE 'MINI FRIDGE' AS A FRIDGE! IF YOU TAKE THE STUFF OUT TO PUT YOUR OWN IN THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR USING IT. They did give us a notice that we 
can ask housekeeping for one for 35 bucks, however they did not tell you a notice before we got into the fridge! Also the plug for the laptop on the lamp is broken and the plug slides in and the laptop does not indicate being on AC power.The bathroom faucet was very loud and my sis's ears were ringing.  


Room detail (positive):The wifi did connect right away and there is no login needed. They also recently upgraded the network as well. The shades aree neat you can have a sheer to let a lil light in or blackout to let you sleep in longer. Fixture quality is decent. TV and entertainment center is really nice and you can plug in game consoles or a laptop with HDMI. Shower looks nice and has curving shower curtain rod. Toilet is in a nook for a lil privacy. I slept really good in the room and the beds are decent. Pollows were good too. 


Overall I am going to give the MGM Grand a 2.2 star rating. The rooms are nice and the location is perfect and the wifi was great, however the negatives listed above take the rating down from 4.5 stars to 2.2 stars. 

Other stuff:

The pool was very nice and relaxing, it had a lot of different types of pools and they even played my kind of music (dance\/trance\/electro) and the vibe was nice. The casino floor was nice as well. Most of all the show KA was AMAZING!

Checking in went fairly fast. We had made a reservation for 4 people. The receptionist was very nice. Not once did she mention what kind of room we were in. I figured we would get 2 beds since the reservation was for 4 people. We walk up to the room and one of the keys didn't work. I've had this happen to me at the Flamingo and it was a nightmare. The other key worked and we walked in the room to find that they gave us a King bed. How the hell are 4 girls supposed to fit in one bed?

PROs: large with lots of variety of quality restaurants, bars, and gambling options. There are a few liquor stores around that you can go grab some bottles for in-room pregaming. There's also a small food court which is nice if you want to grab something cheap and quick. 

CONs: DO NOT STAY in west wing. It's about a 20-25 minute walk to the pool, feels like you're in a prison cell, has absolutely no view (concrete wall), the windows are tiny, we didn't get our room cleaned once (and we were out of the room the entire day), and the bed was rock hard. there is also basically no bathroom privacy - so don't stay with friends if you need any sort of discretion while changing or getting ready. the bathroom is practically in the living room with no door to shut. 

the check-in line is absolutely absurd (expect 30-60 minute wait to check in), and we are M life members and asked for a new room once we got to ours, and they wanted to charge us an extra $15 a night. Really?! you can't waive that for guests that are unsatisfied and gamble at your casino all week? It's not like we asked for an upgrade - we just wanted an actual window that we could see out of, as opposed to a literal concrete wall. 

the pools are luxor quality. sure, there are a lot of them, but they are stuffed with kids and aren't impressive. the adult-only pool costs $35 to get into per person, and no, that's not a dayclub. just a regular pool. the lazy river is gross - its a 70%\/30% ratio of kids to adults, there is liquor in the water, and gross people's feet dangling off tubes all over the place. absolutely don't go in without an inner tube, which is tempting since they cost $20 a day to rent. additionally, the cocktail list at the pool is flimsy and unimpressive. and they spend 60-90 seconds digging through your bag on the way in. Made me feel like going through airport security, and i STILL saw a group of young people with a plastic handle of phillips vodka by the pool. 

For this price point, please please stay at the Mirage. Better location on the strip, MUCH better rooms, a more quiet and luxurious pool, great pool cocktails, and far less children. The MGM is way too big and the quality very clearly suffers because of it.",1,0,0

First of all, when we checked in we were not greeted by the clerk behind the desk. Ed, simply asked for a last name, i.d. and credit card which I handed over. The next 10 min passed without a word from him and next thing I knew my husband and I were handed a key card. I know these folks see a lot of people come in but that doesn't allow you to be rude. We had a reservation for an Executive Suite and were not even asked if a regular room would be ok. When we brought it Ed's attention he seemed surprise. Not sure how he could be because the reservation said Executive Suite. Then he disappears for 20 min without saying a word. When he finally came back he said there were no rooms available but that he would waive the resort fees and give use a $100 credit. We hesitantly agreed because I didn't go to Vegas for my birthday weekend to fight about a room. So we headed to our room and then to the pool. We had a great time with the exception of the waitress on the second day of our stay at the pool. She rudely ignored us while talking to another group of ""older"" people for over 20 min about where they were from. I get you cant please everyone but if I need to order something I don't want to be rudely ignored and then see you ""hustling"" and trying to get a bigger tip from someone else. When she finally did take our order, she brought our bucket of beer and left it for us on someone else's lounge chair without saying anything. My husband and I go to Vegas at least a few times a year, we will NEVER stay here again. We stay at Aria all the time and regretted our whole weekend at MGM. 

Now to start on the room. Our floor was so noisy. Both nights we were here we had drunk random people banging on our doors and yelling in the hallways at all hours of the night. We caught two girls smoking in the hallway of our non smoking floor, who just threw their cigarette butts in the carpeted hallway. When an MGM member came by he simply walked passed the lit cigarette butt and continued taking on his phone. 

As mentioned before, we learned our lesson and will never stay here again. 

Oh by the way, the $100 resort fee that Ed said he would give us was actually only $75 because we already had a $25 resort credit on our room. So he just told us what we wanted to hear I presume so he could be done with us at check in. This place is a joke. For a respected and appreciated stay go to Aria, you won't regret that choice!",2,0,0

I will NEVER stay at this over priced POS Hotel again. Every time I have came their amenities are not able to be used or are in repairs. The pool was closed the jacuzzi was broken the elevator didn't work the escalator style walk way was broken.. This entire hotel is falling apart.

ALL and EVERY employee we had any contact with-- from Bell Men, Parking Attendants, Security, Waitpersons, Concierge, Dealers, etc. etc. etc.-- were wonderful.  Polite, friendly, professional.  SUPER wonderful staff.  Very nice and did great.  We liked that.  It was true everywhere in the hotel casino.  The staff were excellent.  And our maid(s)-- did a fabulous job cleaning our suite every day.  Can't say enough good stuff.  Take some of that $$$ away from the stupid ""suits"" and give the ""working staff"" all raises.. they make the place great.

Place is TOO DARN BIG.   Just too big.  We rented me a ""scooter"" and that helped some with my mobility problems.  But it is still just too big.

POOL:  They have a wonderful Floating River.  Takes a good 10-15 minutes to go around the whole thing. Nice staff, nice plantings, etc.  BUT:  This time, July 4th to 9th, there were TOO MANY KIDS-- screaming, running, bumping, obnoxious, loud, horrible KIDS.   They clogged the floating river and the pools.  Ruined that part for us.  Just too much.

Loved the chicken in mole sauce.   Great meal.   Never made it to the buffet.  For breakfast we loved the cafe restaurant.

Expectations are pretty high for this extremely popular hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Unfortunately, my stay here last September did not meet my expectations. I am a little late to write this review, but better late than never, right?

There was no problem with the hotel itself. Hotel is GORGEOUS, every part in my opinion. Casino is HUGE and full of diverse games. The hotel look itself gets 5\/5. 

Getting from the room to the lobby was always a struggle. First off, it takes FOREVER for an elevator to open up and take you to your room. It makes no sense that only 2 of them seemed to be functioning. Since I went in the summer, which is a busy time, it just seems like a poor choice to only have 2 elevators operating. In addition to the elevator issues, our room took 3 minutes to walk to from the elevator. The hallway was SO long. Very inconvenient. If you stay here, request a room close to the elevator. 

This hotel is located pretty far from the center of the strip. The location gets 3\/5 stars.

The quality of the room was pretty good, other than some old stains on the carpet. Overall, the style was very appealing, and the room with 2 queen beds was fairly spacious, with a large bathroom. Room gets 4\/5 stars.

Customer service was where it fell the shortest... Basically, the lady in the gym was incredibly rude, and because my brother and his boyfriend were wearing normal closed-toe shoes (instead of workout shoes), they kicked him out and were very rude about it. I went down there to complain to her, as my brother felt very unwelcomed. She rolled her eyes and had SERIOUS attitude. I then went to the manager at the front desk to complain, and although she was apologetic, she did not offer any compensation... Even offering the smallest thing would have been appreciated. For the money we paid to stay there, I pushed a little compensation, and she comped my resort fee. That was greatly appreciated. However, she was pretty reluctant to do any compensation. Finally, when I asked someone at security for a bandaid, he was so rude and refused to get one for me. He claimed to be a rep for Enterprise Car Rental. I get that he wasn't a direct employee at the hotel, but he is still a representation of the hotel, and should at least be kind.

Overall, my stay here was not horrible. It fell slightly below my expectations. A large hotel, like the MGM Grand, needs to work on listening to their customers and keeping them happy.",1,0,0

MGM Grand was not our first stop in Vegas. On 6\/28\/17 my partner and I stayed two nights at Luxor (another MGM property) and had a decent time. We enjoyed our time at Luxor for the price and had no complaints for our stay there. For the nights of 6\/30-7\/2 we stayed at The Venetian and had the most marvelous stay\/treatment and will 110% return to The Venetian for our annual trips to Vegas.

For the nights of 7\/3 & 7\/4 we regrettably stayed at MGM Grand. When we arrived, we were a bit taken aback by the $20\/day valet fee, especially after our stay at The Venetian which had free valet, but since we were already there it was convenient - just makes us not want to waste $40 on valet every again. We got into the hotel and, after a 30 minute wait in line, checked into our room which was thankfully clean and ready to go for our arrival at 1pm. We had 4 large pillows on our bed which is exactly what we need. Later in the day, we took a shower and realized our drain was clogged and we were standing in a pool of dirty water so we called the front desk and were told that someone would come fix it for us. After my shower, I began drying my hair with the hair dryer when it suddenly stopped working. Thankfully I had brought my own anyways so I simply switched to using my own hair dryer. We had no other complaints for the day.

Our main concern was our SAFETY when between the time of 10pm-3am someone entered our room while we were sleeping!! We went to bed around 10pm so I know it was after that, and I woke up later around 3am and actually checked my phone at that time. We do not know who the person was as it was pitch black, but we assume they worked at the hotel because they came in pretty noisy like they expected we were gone and I assume they got scared when they saw us so they left. I don't think they realized they woke us up because they ""snuck"" out trying to stay quiet and did not close the door completely. It took us a moment to realize what happened before we got out of bed, got dressed and went over to the door to turn the deadbolt. Since we turned the deadbolt, we decided to take care of the problem in the morning and finish getting our sleep since we needed to be up early and we were too exhausted and frustrated to try to deal with the problem right then. We woke up and took a shower which was STILL clogged, so either no one came to fix it the day before or they did not double check that they did their job correctly so we had to again shower while standing in a tub full of nasty water. We went down to speak with someone about the stranger that came into our room and they told us they would move us to a new room. They apologized and offered to move us to a nicer room with a nicer view. However, when we moved, the room was EXACTLY the same as our old room, except it was 8 floors lower, not as nice of a view and smelled strongly of cigarettes (we specifically paid more for strip view\/non-smoking), there were dirty dishes outside of our door, the bar snacks were not filled back up which made me worry that they would charge us for them since they were missing, and we only had 2 pillows (easy fix as we just called and they brought us two more). Thankfully we did not have anyone walk into our room the 2nd night, but we were EXTREMELY upset with our stay at MGM Grand and did not feel like anything was done about it. The blame was put on another guest when they said ""Oh, it's Vegas and a lot of people are drunk so I'm sure the door just malfunctioned and another guest entered your room and then realized it was the wrong room."" Ridiculous answer to an inexcusable high safety issue that should have been addressed better - someone entering someone else's room is a HUGE deal that should NEVER happen.",1,1,0

Not for the overpriced food and definitely not to get to see the lions that rarely ever come out from their little habitat there.  It's to take money from the tourists on the poker tables.

MGM opened their new poker room about a few years back (I was there) and it's probably one of the nicer rooms IMHO.  For starters, the room is right in the smack dab middle of the hotel and is quite spacious and roomy.  The tables are spread out enough so that you don't feel like sardines like you do over at the Bellagio poker room.  On popular club nights, you can check out the hot ladies all dolled up walking to Studio 54 which is the hotel's club.  But most importantly for some reason, a lot of fish tend to throw their money away at the MGM and I've been there many a time to catch them.  

As far as restaurants go, there are quite a few places to go within the MGM. Wolfgang pucks, Wichcraft, Diego's for fine dine Mexican and the list goes on and on.  There's even a food court if you feel like a quick slice of pizza of Mickie D's and of course there's the buffet, but theirs is nothing to write home about.

The hotel casino hotel over all is decent but I consider it 2nd tier to all the nicer ones like the Venetian, Bellagio and the Wynn for example.  Still that doesn't mean I don't stay here once in awhile when they send me free rooms in the mail.

I stayed here a few years ago and it wasn't bad. However, my most recent trip in October 2014 was a huge, huge disappointment. 

I stayed in a Petite King room in the West Wing. There is no better way to describe the room than ""petite"" and borderline claustrophobic. The room is tiny, poorly lit, and has one window that does not open........  There isn't even a separate door to the bathroom\/shower! As soon as you walk in, the bathroom is to the left right next to a shower and sink. The walls are also kinda thin- I could hear my neighbors' bathrooms flush. 

There is also no mini fridge or coffee maker.. I thought these simple ""luxuries"" were standard nowadays. 

One of the MOST annoying things about the room was its location. The hallways are ridiculously long (and I'm not even trying to sound lazy; they are just LONG. It takes at least 3-4 minutes walking at a decent pace to get down from one end to the elevator). They are also a bit eerie. 

One ""good"" thing about the West Wing is the cardio room on the 4th floor. It's free and while it's tiny and sauna-like, it is better than nothing considering MGM charges guests $10 to access the actual hotel gym.

What a disappointment, MGM. Not staying here again. (The Signature Towers, on the other hand, are a complete different story. SO modern and upscale).",3,1,0

I had my 6 year old with me so granted I was not looking to do any gambling or nightlife this trip.  What I was looking for was a fun pool for he and I to play in and a good location to get to the things we wanted to do.  

The pool is large and honestly, we never had any trouble finding deck chairs whether we went down in the morning or the late afternoon.  I did find that the Lazy River runs out of inner tubes to rent pretty quickly so that was disappointing.  As was the fact that the largest pool and the Lazy River don't open until 10 AM and the Lazy River closes at 6 instead of 8 like the other pools.  

Also, there isn't much in the way of exhibits or entertainment for kids under 12 (minimum age for their CSI Experience) so we ended up going over to the Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, NYNY and the Luxor to play in the arcades and see their exhibits (Titanic, Shark Reef, etc.)

The room was clean and spacious and there is definitely a big variety of kid-friendly dining options at the MGM.  I should mention that the MGM advertises free WiFi and I could get my phone and iPad to find the MGM WiFi signal but I couldn't get online using their WiFi ever.  And the TV will randomly lose signal in the middle of a show....A LOT.  But if you just click the channel up one and back down the signal was back.

but they changed our room the next day and life was good. The food is pretty good from what i ate of their inroom dining and the fact that they customize orders for you won me over cause generally i find service standards across America to be pretty lousy compared to hotels in Asia and Middle East and even Africa. 
Their check in and checkout lines are awful. To have to start your trip waiting one hour to just get a key card is awful. for as long as they have been in business and with the number rooms they have, i feel its almost unforgivable they they are ok making guests wait that long. And not that they are short on real estate to accommodate more counters and allocate more people to the task. I checked in at 9pm on a sunday and there were 30 people ahead of me and it took over an hour to check in.

I think the last time I stayed here was probably NYE of 2005 or 2006 I think.  And it hasn't really changed much in regards to comfort or style.  The room we got was very nice - a standard King bed room (no view) on the 16th floor!  Comfortable bed and pillows with a cute little chaise and desk. 

My Turn ons:
1) they have a registration desk IN the baggage claim area of the airport. Check in while waiting for your luggage (how frickin cool is that!)! No waiting in line, get your room keys, grab your bags then hop into a cab and jet up to your room! Easy.
2) near the airport.. cab ride is only about $10-12.
3) monorail!!! No more hiking an entire mile just to go to Caesar's Palace or catching a cab for $10 to get all the way across the strip to Wynn or Venetian! For $12, you get unlimited rides for an entire 24 hours! Hop on the monorail to get to the Bally's area, the convention center, LVH, the Stratosphere or the Venetian. However, its hours are limited (http:\/\/www.lvmonorail.com\/)

My Turn offs:
1) even with the convenience of monorail, it's still kinda far from most of the current popular party spots located farther down on the strip (Encore, Venetian or Aria to name a few).
2) there's not a whole lot of variety in restaurants to choose from.",1,0,1

We stayed in the MGM Grand, which is located at the bottom of The Strip and is a prime location for exploration. The lobby was quite grand and beautifully decorated with marble flooring and the MGM lion sat firmly in the centre. The checkin process was relatively quick with the hotel accommodating our request for a room on a high floor, which ended up being on the 14th floor in the West Wing. The checkout process was even quicker as we did not bill anything to the room, so we were able to checkout at one of the express machines and it took mere seconds to type in the details and then lick ""checkout"", and then we were done! Unfortunately, the sleek and modern décor ended at the lobby as the casino area of the hotel was carpeted and rather dark and dated, and desperate for a modernisation, especially when compared to other hotels like Aria, Flamingo or even The Signature at MGM. However, the tiled flooring did reappear around the shops and food court area but still looked rather dated up until you arrive at the steps to the pool and Wet Republic. You would also find here the entrance to access the three Tower Blocks of The Signature.

The hotel had great facilities, and massive pool area with a lazy river and multiple intimate pools sporadically planted around. My only critique was that they had no parasols, which in 40 degree heat is essential protection against sunburn. I believe this to be a huge health and safety issue, and the best cover could only be found behind a palm tree or along the side of a building. Providing guests with shade should be a priority for any hotel guests who want to lounge by a pool. What I found great about spending time by the pool was the waiter service, having a cold drink brought to you was perfect! Guests could pay by cash, card or charge to room, so plenty of options. With multiple pools to choose from, guests could take a dip in a small one or go for a swim in a larger one. The pools also played music all day, which gets you into that party spirit.

A tip for all guests looking for a little more relaxation, or with young families, then you should check out the pools at The Signature. As MGM guests, you can use the whole facilities, which includes access to the three towers of The Signature and their pools. These pools are small an intimate, full of loungers with parasols and the pool is completely in the shade until around lunchtime.

As for our room, it was relatively small, and despite being on the 14th floor, the view outside was an obscure one of The Strip though a small window, which couldn't be opened. I was disappointed with the dark décor and lighting in the room as it kept the room looking quite unwelcoming, despite the full length mirrors in each corner! The bathroom area wasn't designed very well as the shower and toilet were separated into two cubicles and one more annoyance was that the bath towels were stored on a shelf\/rail above the toilet, so you had to leave the shower and then go into the toilet cubicle for a towel, which was very impractical, unless you hang the towel outside the shower door; but who thinks about doing this every time they shower? And again the lighting in the bathroom area was relatively poor. I think this was because the room didn't have ceiling lights!

Other issues I had with the room compared to what I am used to are: The safe is completely impractical as it is tall and narrow; it is as if the hotel has installed a floor safe in the wall within the wardrobe. Secondly, the hotel does not have tea & coffee making facilities or fridges in the rooms, which initially, I didn't think would be an issue as an experience traveller, I took a travel kettle and cooler bag, which I kept filling up zip-locked bags with ice to keep our water bottles cold. However, after a couple of days, this became a huge annoyance. Would it be that much trouble to have these facilities when even three star hotels have these.

Wifi was a bit tricky to access in the room initially, and after 48 hours, we had to login again and had constant issues, either not connecting at all or slow speeds and not loading. Pain! Another disappointing factor was that our room was not cleaned on the first day.

Overall, the hotel was ok and quick to address our concerns and questions. It had great facilities. The pool area was fantastic (despite the concern about shade!), but the ability to use the facilities at The Signature was perfect! Coming back to Vegas, I would opt to stay at The Signature, and I would recommend this to others as the rooms here are bigger (from what I have read!) and you have a microwave, tea & coffee making facilities and a fridge in the rooms, which is great for bigger parties. You also have a more modern hotel and relaxing pools, and you still get to use all the facilities throughout the MGM complex.",7,2,4

When we arrived at 4 in the afternoon we were told they GAVE AWAY OUR ROOM.  They told us there were no more rooms like that and we would have to take a regular King room and was told it would have a strip view.  They said they would refund the difference and give us a $50 food credit.  We said we wanted the room we reserved and they said it was impossible.  After speaking with a manager we still had no choice.  We went upstairs to find the view was of a roof top and a few airplanes.  We complained again only to be put in a room that was on a higher floor but still a rooftop and still a standard king room.

After waiting in that enormous line to check in, I just wanted to relax and play some slots. Literally, the first machine we sat down at, some guy comes sweeping by and grabs my purse. He was gone in an instant. I notified the slot machine attendant who lazily walked over to the security desk. They couldn't have been less concerned. The security guard questioned the witness who saw the man take my purse, but not once did he ask her name or contact information. They never even asked me what my wallet looked like!

Now the runaround began for us. We went to go talk to the casino investigator who wouldn't even check the cameras. We were told what they caught was ""random."" Yeah right. The investigator told us that we needed to file a police report for them to do anything. 

Next we were sent to the hotel manager, Alice C.  I have never encountered such an incompetent manager. All she offered to do for us was call the police. After 45 minutes of waiting on hold, Alice asked if we wanted to go ""enjoy ourselves in the casino"" instead of calling the police. I was livid at this point because she was so insensitive to make a comment like that and kept referring to ""the lost item.""  No! It was freaking stolen. Finally, I got ahold of the police and got a police report number. They said that it was the MGM's JOB TO INVESTIGATE. When I told Alice that she said, ""Oh, do you want to file a report with us?"" I about lost my mind when she said that!

So the investigator comes up to the front desk where we are and brings some useless paperwork for us to fill out. He starts filling out a report too but has YET TO ASK ME WHAT MY PURSE LOOKED LIKE (he never did, btw). My husband asked, ""why weren't you filling out that report an hour ago when we talked to you?!"" He mumbled some answer like, ""I was going to after you guys left."" Yeah right. They couldn't be less concerned. 

We never heard from anyone regarding my purse again. 

Later, a bartender said that stuff gets stolen all the time there. Good to know.

I hated the corridors with low ceilings and overall, just was displeased with the entire West Wing portion of the hotel.

They have the few on the strip that let you split aces and double-down (all the fun things).  Believe it or not, the only two other hotels I've been to that have those options are Mandalay Bay and Treasure Island (let me know if I'm wrong?).

You pretty much have a city built inside the hotel, and you will have everything at your disposal. The night before we stayed at the Signatures, and we knew the move wouldn't be that big of deal. Its about a 10-15 min walk from the towers of Signatures to MGM. 

The room itself definitely lived up to the name. Beds were very comfortable, showers were large enough and had good source of hot water and there was even a desk and a couch for you spend time away from the beds. I hate hotels where the only thing you get is just a bed, it reminds me of motel 6. The only gripe I have is that the room's TV is still the old school tube. Most hotels now days atleast come with a flat screen. I m sure the West Wing has it hooked up like that.  Other then that, the room was great! 

As far as amenities and perks, I will start off by saying I saved about $150 off the cover at Wet Republic. I got a special which gave us free access, and we were able to use it towards LDW 09 Monday.  Next we saved an additional $40 off the all day buffet. We got a 2 for 1 deal, so I only had to pay for one person.  We could've saved more if we went to Tabu, but we got hook ups at XS.. so we weren't going to mess around.

I love that parking is free at the hotels along the strip. The MGM grand parking is plentiful and pretty easy to navigate. Unless you park in the garage, you might not know there are a few shops and food places on the lower level. Nothing worth making a special trek down there, but if you want ice cream or breakfast or a souvenir, you can find options there.

We happened upon the lion habitat by accident. There were a couple of lions and a lot of people taking pictures. If you've ever been to a zoo, there's not much else to see here.

The casino floor is clean and vast. We wanted to play roulette but the only human attended table was a $25 min table. We stood watching a bit and decided to put in a single bet just for fun. As we were taking our money out, the dealer immediately told us that there were cheaper tables on the other side of the casino. She gave us a bit of an attitude so we left to go find the other tables. Sure, there were other roulette tables, but none were open. We wandered back and then returned to the ""too expensive"" table to place our single bet. We played a bit of blackjack but had to leave since we were just trying to kill an hour before we checked out.

Truth be told, I am not a huge proponent of Las Vegas. A weekend every 2-3 years is plenty for me. That said, MGM Grand is always the first place I look to when booking a room in Sin City and has been for years. The amenities are on par with just about any other Resort\/Casino on the Strip and MGM is one of the few Hoteliers that offers everything in one location from Michelin rated restaurants to nightclubs to shows and even has Nathan's Hot Dogs in its bowels. You really do not have to leave the MGM in order to have the full Vegas experience and I suppose that is what keeps me coming back. 

I stayed most recently over a weekend to attend a bachelor party and yes - it did get well out of control - but I had a fantastic time. This was the first time I was able to stay in the Skylofts and I think it has ruined me when it comes to staying in the regular suites. Skyline views, walk in closets\/bathrooms, a pool table, they even have a dedicated Butler for each Skyloft to assist you in any way imaginable (it helps to tip them $300.00 off the bat - you will want for nothing). The service is truly impeccable and we were partying like Guns & Roses circa 1987. This is the only way to do Vegas, but it certainly doesn't come cheap. 

Age has taken a toll on the facade of the MGM Grand, during daylight hours the exterior reminds one that this Resort was opened in 1993, it badly needs a fresh coat of paint and the windows are in need of washing. Once the night comes, however, the MGM Grand looks like it was opened last week.

Just running the water for a bit would give anyone a clue this was an issue. Again, the maid did nothing to fix it.  Oh well.",0,0,0

I was very hesitant about staying here since there are so many awful reviews, but I personally had an amazing stay here at the MGM. I arrived Thursday, July 27th and only waited about 15 minutes max to check in. I was worried since it was 1pm and a bit earlier then checkin time, but I was accommodated thanks to Angelita. She was so pleasant, informative and provided great customer service! Otherwise we stayed in the Grand Tower which the grand king did not disappoint (didn't have much of a view on the 25th floor) but nonetheless the room was very clean and comfortable! The pools are nice and accommodate everyone from children, young adults to seniors. I also loved their buffet which was delicious and very satisfying! The location is also prime on the strip!

This is my second visit to MGM.  The property is located in an excellent location with access to most of the casinos on the South end of the strip. 
The Spa is amazing and the Pool area is big and well laid out.  I was a little disappointed at the West Wing accommodations as I had expected something a little more lush based on the advertisement and price.  
The cafe by the pool was awful and overpriced.
On the plus side, Wolfgang Pucks restaurant and Circe Du Soleil's Ka, both located in GMG, are definitely worth the upscale price.

check in was a breeze, and the lady was even nice enough to make sure that the rooms i ordered were right next to each other.  this particular hotel is a little far from certain sights [like the bellagio fountains] and you kind of have to traverse shadier areas in order to get to the miracle mile shops... but with a few younger kids in tow, all they really wanted to see was the m'm and coca cola store [which is right next to the hotel]... so that's good!

The only negative was that (I agree with another reviewer on this) it is a VERY big hotel.  It took us about 15 minutes to get to our room each time we entered the building.  

The pool area is phenomenal.  There are several pools to choose from, with the lazy river being the highlight.  If you want a tube though, you will have to pay $16.  If you are staying for more than a couple days, I recommend just buying the smaller tubes that they have for purchase.  They are a couple bucks cheaper, and you can keep them and use them every time you go to the pool.

I was a little bit disappointed that the lions weren't there anymore!  Last time I was in Vegas, that was such a fun highlight for me!  They do have a lot of other entertainment on site though.  If I had more time (and if tickets were a bit cheaper), I would have loved to see David Copperfield's show!

I stayed in both the basic Queen room and the Executive Queen Suite. Basic Queen was nice and clean. The Executive Queen Suite was nice as well. It had both a bath and a shower, and a couch. I found that it was nice to have a TV both in front of the couches and in front of the beds. I enjoyed the black out curtains in both rooms, unique and fun. I now know what type of screens I would like for my home. 

The portion of my stay that was horrendous was the service at the front desk. I was visiting vegas for a Bachelorette party. I described the situation of how I need to check in now, but would like for them to give the room keys to the other main person under the room (she was the maid of honor and was surprising us\/kicked us out of the room until the surprise was ready). I asked the front desk man if he understood what I was asking and if everything was fine. He agreed all was fine (but honestly I felt like he was staring at me listening to some story and thinking I was an idiot or something). 30 minutes later, I receive a phone call from the maid of honor and her mother that we were not checked in. I had to walk quickly\/ run back to MGM from Cosmopolitan to deal with the incompetent front desk. As I almost arrived to MGM, I received a text from the maid of honor's mother telling me that she spoke to a supervisor and that we were checked in now. I still was told to retrieve some keys, so I continued to the front desk. When I arrived there, I was told we weren't checked in and asked them to check us in. I don't know how many times my party has to say CHEK US IN for MGM's front desk to understand. They are incompetent and need retraining. Their customer service skills need to improve (although some were fine) and they need to work on listening to the client. The second person I spoke to that actually checked me in said he would let his manager know of the situation, but my party never received any apology for their incompetence. 

The best service at MGM was the concierge. They really went above and beyond to help the maid of honor with the surprises for the bride to be. It included room service with tasty treats and champagne to celebrate, chocolate covered strawberries and a surprise gift, which included more alcohol and martini glasses we could keep. 

The other great part of MGM are the managers. They have that position for a reason. I spoke to the MGM front desk manager over the phone. I expressed their need to improve their customer service skills at the front desk and explained everything I had went through with MGM. DId i mention, I was my first visit and I was horrified? He was extremely kind and interested in figuring out what happened. He thanked me many times and appreciated my input in helping improve their front desk service. I just wanted to let them know how terrible my front desk experience was, the apologies are nice, and if the manager gets to the bottom of which guy sucked at life.

So to stay at MGM or not to stay? you COULD... If their front desk improves. Concierge was awesome so if you do have a special event, you know you can count on them. I say use a coin and toss. 

on another note, do all hotels not have microwaves? or do you have to request one? Is that even an option?",0,0,0

-Do I want entertainment? There are shows (KA; David Coppefield; etc) or depending on the schedule a concert or fight. MGM has the Grand Arena which has the capacity to hold a large number of people to attend headline concerts and\/or major fights.
-Do I want to eat? There's a variety of eateries and restaurants to choose ranging from food court dining to fine dining. My favorite steak place, Craftsteak is right here :)
-Do I want to sleep well? The room rates are pretty good compared to other hotels on the strip. The rooms have been updated and the beds are comfy. 
-Do I want to party? There are bars and lounges sprinkled throughout the hotel. There's also Wet Republic day club and  the newest night club in town, Hakkasan.
-Do I want to relax? There is a spa and the very large pool area with a number of pools to choose from. 
-Do I want to gamble? Take your pick of the many tables offered in the casino. 

As I'm writing this review, I'm comfortably situated in my newly remodeled MGM room. The entire room is pitch black (making it ideal to fully concentrate on Yelping lol) thanks to the awesome blackout shades that I can automatically control with a push of a button. Of the other hotels I've stayed at, this is the only time I've ever seen legit blackout shades and as many times as I've been to Vegas, there's nothing more annoying than rays of light peeking and\/or streaming through your window after a very long night of gambling, drinking, and clubbing! But enough about the blackout shades...

As mentioned in my initial review, MGM consistently offers me reasonable room rates. There are 2 ways for you to score their deals (I've done both). 
1) Sign up to receive their emails. Check out mgmgrand.com to sign up on their guestbook.
2) Sign up to become an Mlife member. Check out Mlife.com for info. It's free to sign up. Most Vegas hotels offer players cards that reward you for your loyalty to them, but I've solely remained an Mlife member because of its ease of use, its perks, and I can also use it at other Vegas hotels within the MGM network (Aria, Vdara, Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, etc). These are hotels I usually frequent when I'm in Vegas. I'm in the gold tier ;) 

During this most recent Vegas trip, I came with my mom and sister for a quick weekend getaway. For a Sat-Mon stay, total came to $208 including taxes and fees. My mom booked it via her Mlife membership.

In 3 days, I'm returning to Vegas with my boyfriend, family, and friends. No surprise as to where we're all staying lol.",6,2,1

Modern, amazing design, fun games.  Amazing food

We paid 30$ for early check in which was totally worth it.     Our room was 9th floor,  not really a cool view but we didn't care.  We had a petite king room

It had the fluffiest bath towels I have ever used.  Really cool big shower. 


The bath products smelled so good, green tea and jasmine

We received 2 complimentary buffet credits for our choice of breakfast  lunch or dinner

We choose breakfast 

Well I suppose it was brunch. 


It came with complimentary champagne or mimosas.  Coffee....


Hella bacon, yummy eggs,  breakfast burritos,  pancakes waffles,  omelet station. Ice cream.  Desserts.  Carving station.  Cold cuts cheese

For a buffet it's good, and I am very glad I didn't have to pay 30$ per person to enjoy it.

The only item I wish I saw was lox. 


The pool is amazing., multiple pools, lazy river 
The drinks at the pool came in a large collectible cup for about 20 bucks.  The drinks were made well they did not skip on the alcohol,  but they didn't taste too strong,  or too sugary.  They were just right and I feel the price was fair for what I got.  

We were given complimentary inner tube rentals which was great

10 bucks to rent a locker for the day 




We ate at other restaurants like shibuya and the pub.  Both amazing 

We were comped a ton of drinks while gambling which was great because we spent 100s of dollars lol

You never really have to leave the hotel itself. Between the shops, the choice of restaraunts, and other things to do. The casino was my favorite out of Paris, Flamingo, Luxor, Harrahs.

I will keep it to the point despite the fact I want to get into the smallest of details.

I attended a health & fitness conference at MGM in June and it was the perfect setting.  All the walking to and from the convention\/conference areas is quite the workout and you get to explore different parts of the hotel and casino.  The weather was great - low 100s - dry heat.  The dry heat was great and this is coming from someone who grew up and lives in the Pacific Northwest. It only took me a couple hours to acclimate but then I was fine.  

I shared my room with 3 other gals - big mistake, don't do it unless you are related; Hormone overload and different opinions on how to keep & share a room and courtesy among other things.  I'm sure 4 guys can get a long just fine - different dynamics, I guess.  Anyway, I still like my former roomies, but will only room with one of them again. :)  The rooms are big enough for 4 adults but I would keep it to 2-3.  Plenty of storage and you can reserve a fridge - we brought collapsible coolers that fit nicely in our luggage instead of paying $25 per day for a fridge. 

Beds were comfy and we were in one of the newly renovated rooms.  Very nice! The bathroom was spacious, well ventilated, and nicely decorated.  We had some trouble with our key cards working but just gave it a few more tries.  Also the door didn't close all the way, so make sure you shut it behind you.  

Pros: 
*Huge - A city within itself
*Comfy rooms
*Nice views
*Everything you need from toiletries to coffee to meals is just downstairs from your room
*Lots to do - people watching is also fun
*Variety of restaurants from fast food to high end
*Pool and Cabanas
*Fitness Center
*Literally next to M&M World and Coca Cola World among other hot spots
*Near drug stores - Go to Walgreens for .99 gallons of water, food (they even had fresh items), inexpensive souvenirs, and cash back at the register (I don't use ATMs to draw money, I go to Walgreens, as needed to avoid fees).  CVS and ABC stores are also nearby, too.   

Cons:
*Crazy expensive snack\/toiletry shop by the elevators - I needed bandages and they were expensive.  Go to Walgreens, CVS, ABC, etc, if you can.  Might still be spendy but a little better priced than the MGM shop.  The gift store might be another story, I didn't check there for bandages. You could probably go to concierge or the front desk for one bandage, if needed.  I usually carry my own but ran out. :)
*Distance from room to conference\/convention area was far especially if you want to shower and change after a group workout and head to a workshop in time.  Stay at the Signature - It is closer to the conference areas - if distance, showering, and punctuality is important to you.  Plus the Signature has a kitchenette! :) 
*Walking through cigarette smoke to and from workouts and workshops - this was a health & fitness conference and second hand smoke should be avoided.
*Some of the food spots inside MGM (fast food, dessert, quick bites) close down early! That's kind of crazy in this 24\/7 city.  They should stay open later.  You can always venture out to the Food Court outside\/right next door to MGM to see what's cooking.  PF Chang's is also within walking distance from the hotel. 

I love MGM and this was my second stay and I will definitely return.  The front desk staff were awesome and sociable during our interactions.  I miss seeing the lions but I hope they are doing well. One of my fave hotels in Vegas hands down, plus it looks pretty snazzy at night.",2,3,2

Literally, hours without water, or another non-alcoholic beverage. No exaggeration, hours. I'm repeating it several times, because it was over 3 hours, after having waitresses at the table every 10 minutes to serve me alcohol. When I said I didn't want to drink anymore, they stopped serving me water. Not recommended.

*Thank you to Lori for reaching out promptly after seeing this review. If it is at all helpful, the time this took place was between 5 and 8 am on September 14th. This isn't a reflection on the wait staff who served, because they were accommodating (when they were there). The poker room manager, however, was standoffish and even lied about getting a member of the staff over to the table multiple times, and told me if I was thirsty I should leave the casino and get water elsewhere.",0,0,0

Upon arriving, we really should have stopped right in front of the main entrance and dropped off our luggage. This was my fault. I am so used to parking and just walking my luggage to the registration area myself. But the process wasn't as easy as I thought. So tip for you people - drop your stuff at the front and then go park your car! 

Registration area service was good and we didn't have to wait to long. We came here for a convention and so I'm sure they were busy but they accommodated to us very well and let us have an early check in. That was a lifesaver! 

When we finally got to the room, the room looked typical. Nothing fantastic. bed was comfy and sheets looked as clean as it could be I suppose. The bathroom was more spacious than some other ones I have been to. But the shower head was broken and the toilet was kind of gross and yellow. There was also some ""trash"" in the bathroom still. 

We had to call the front desk many times for various reason and we were put on hold for at least 15-20 minutes each time we called. We were not happy campers about this at all. 

Service kinda sucks at this place and therefore I can't give it a 4. I'm just glad we got this place with a good coupon code deal or else I would have been even more dissatisfied. 

Overall, this place is a good location on the strip and you have a wide selection of places to eat inside the hotel. But service was crappy so just be aware of that!",5,5,3

Over the many years I've been coming to Vegas, I've stayed at said MGM Grand and have watched it evolve from the family-friendly amusement park\/casino and kitschy ""museum"" of all things MGM to the hipper but still comparatively un-hip MGM Grand of today.  This time, I was just here to eat, drink, and gamble...in that order.  

The MGM Grand isn't a bad place.  There are tons of great attributes to the place.  From the eponymously named Joël Robuchon to Robuchon's L'Atelier to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak to Michael Mina's Nobhill Tavern and Seablue, and offerings from Wolfgang Puck and Emeril, the MGM's collection of fine-dining restaurants is second to none in Vegas.  The MGM has a stellar Cirque du Soleil show, KÀ, and the MGM Grand Garden Arena for concerts and fights.  I don't play poker but the poker room looks to be high quality.  Heck, the pool isn't bad either, although I'm not much for Spring Break-like parties.  The MGM is just lacking that quality that ties all of its good things together and makes the whole greater than the sum of its individual parts.  

So what makes the MGM fall short of its potential?  The MGM Grand likes to tout its Maximum Vegas experience.  Sometime bigger isn't always better.  The gambling area is sprawling, but very vanilla, and lacking any energy or excitement.  The sheer size of the gaming area disperses players and the seemingly desirable energetic din of the crowd of gamblers is lost in the rafters high above the casino floor.  Basically, the place is too big for its own good.   

I haven't figured out if the MGM is trying to be a quiet, relaxing resort experience with spectacular restaurants and world-class entertainment or does it want to be party central with the hip, happening b-list celeb-laden pool party attracting a younger crowd into its casino.  Regardless, the MGM Grand's seemingly perpetual identity crisis results in it being a great place to eat and be entertained, just an average place play, but not a place I'd choose to stay.",1,1,2

I used to be in the hospitality industry, so when I go to Las Vegas I am eager to be wowed, but my expectations are reasonable because I also understand the restrictions that establishments have. 

So this review is as fair as it gets. 

Short version of this review: 

1. Unbearable pulsing hum outside my room kept me up all night. 
2. Food made me throw up in the morning. 
3. What looked like blood spots on my friend's sheets grossed us out. (We later found out this was from the rust in the driers. Doesn't matter, fix it, get on top of your game!) 
4. No compensation for any of this, no recovery on the part of the establishment. 
5. STILL CHARGED ME FOR THE FOOD THAT MADE ME THROW UP AND MISS HALF OF MY CLASSES FROM MY CONVENTION! WHAT?! Yup, that's MGM, I guess. 

Long Version:

My experience at the MGM grand was not only a disappointment, it was appalling. Worst of all, MGM knew about my issues and DIDN'T OFFER ME A THING to compensate for this. In the hospitality industry, we call this part the ""recovery""...it would appear the MGM Grand Hotel and casino has never even heard of this concept. 

I was in Vegas for a convention for which I paid a pretty penny. I got to my hotel and the check in desk people were VERY pleasant. I then got to my room and prepared for a restful night after a long drive...NOPE, sorry, a nonstop pulsing hum coming from god knows where kept me up. I slept two hours. 

The following day I slept 4 hours, but the hum was gone, so this time it could be the copious amounts of oxygen pumped into my room to keep me up and gambling. 

But the worst part was this: I ordered some room service after not eating at all for 12 hours. The guy who delivered it was AWESOME too. Great guy, got a great tip. The following morning, after sleeping 6 hours in two nights, I wake up at 6am with a migraine and nausea. I threw up my entire meal. Being sick, I also missed 2 invaluable classes that I can never get back. MGM COST ME MONEY AND KNOWLEDGE! 

I reported this, a gentlemen came and got my information and details of the incident. I assumed this would allow them to make things right. But no. My food was on my bill upon check out and I insisted that they remove it. They did so without hesitation, but then the food showed up on my credit card bill! WHAT!? I couldn't even help them recover myself??? 

A lady got back to me a week later telling me she investigated my incident. She said no other reports were made about the salmon that night, basically subtly suggesting that it was something else despite knowing I hadn't eaten anything before their meal. But here's the thing, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF NO ONE ELSE GOT ILL, I did! No one else getting ill only shows that the salmon wasn't stored improperly, but it could still be prepared improperly as surfaces and utensils can affect the salmon in a case by case basis. 

My friend also had some gross spots in his room after waiting 30 minutes for his room to be ready. He said they looked like blood. Later, it was explained that the spots are rust from the dryers. That's not an excuse, fix this! 

The staff was very pleasant at MGM which earns them 2 stars. But if you're in the capital of the hospitality industry, act the part.",4,0,0

This was no Treasure Island or Monte Carlo! MGM has gotten a serious makeover! When you see MGM on the strip it looks old-iish, but because it is black and has the green lights with a lion statue, it doesn't look TOO  bad. 

When you enter the lobby it really is grand! The lobby has an old look to it and so does the elevators going up to the floors... but once you hit your floor and your room, the look is totally revamped and modern. We got a room with a king sized bed and wow that bed was SUPER comfy. I could lay in it all day! The cool thing about their bed was that the light switch was on the headboard! 

The room was a little too dim though...maybe because we got a king sized bed so they were trying to promote intimacy? Anyway, I loved the shower. It was so spacious and clean! I  hate the bathrooms with the tubs...This one had glass doors (but obviously it isn't transparant to the point where you could see right through it). 

I really enjoyed my stay here! Had just a comfortable stay here. The only bad thing about it is that there are so many wings and our room ended up being a little bit of a walk from the elevator.

I love you. I love you like an ant finding a piece of sugar and carry it back to it's anthill... I love you like that.

I did stay here because of a Yelp event, but I could had stayed anywhere else really. I could had stayed at the Aria, Stratosphere, and even Platinum.... but no. I chose the MGM... why? Because it's high end without the price. 

I got a King Room with a view! Loved it! 27th floor. Woot!
My fiance and I loved it. 

ROOM:
Clean. Fridge. TV. LOTS OF PILLOWS (This is a plus for me). 

And surprisingly... OUTLETS next to the bed!!! Don't you hate it when you need to charge your phone and you have to find a plug and then you see the lamp is tied to the plug and then you have to find another source because you need lights? Then you have to leave your phone ON the floor... Not here! Outlets attached to the lamp, biatches!!! Aw yeah, +1 Star for me.

Free Wifi - SWEETNESS

The shades were SO COOL. Press button for shade, press button for ULTIMATE BLACKNESS. 

BATHROOM:
Spacious... and LOTS of towels. YES. I love you.

CONDIMENTS:
All fancy and it worked. I had jasmine scented shampoo and conditioner and soaps and lotions. The quality... eh... I've had better, but it was a big amount per night ratio (As an Asian, I look at that). 

BONUS:
We received a Welcome Champagne and chocolates and water from the hotel - mainly for yelp stuff but honestly... I've been to the MGM before without champagne and it was pretty sweet still. So the fact they gave us it, I would had given them 6 stars. 

RESORT FEES: 
Umm... I'm a sweet-talker. Just gonna say that. 
But if I did get the fees, you bet I would be at the pool and gym using ALL the amenities. The Asian in me would be all up on that. 

SERVICE:
Front desk was so nice and easy checking in and out... it was the Billboard Music Awards that weekend and I was still treated well... Sweet. 

OVERALL:
Love this place. 
Yes, I'd stay at the Lion again.",6,3,7

We got a comped room via ""MyVegas"" and they put us in a smoking room in the West Wing - as it was ""all they had left."" Immediately walking up to the West Wing I realized, Wow they put us in a DUMP because it was free! You can smell the cigarette and weed from downstairs and in the elevators... granted I don't really care about either smell but when its that obnoxious... yuck. Our room was 3-505... practically the LAST room at the end of the hallway. The hallway carpet was stained and sticky... the room literally smelled and looked like shit. I mean these rooms are supposedly ""remodeled"" but it really looks like they just gave it a makeover but the ugly shitty old rooms are still under there, I would've rather slept in my car! Also note that the other guests they put in this wing are pretty much the loud, rachet, ghetto degenerates. 

Thankfully - we had to go out so we just dropped off our stuff and left. However, when we came back, we went straight to the front desk to try to get an upgrade. THANK THE LORD FOR SOPHIA A. Sophia saved our trip.... I told her the situation, and she even laughed a bit when she found out we were in the West Wing. Apparently its KNOWN to the employees that its a shitty space. Anyways, she did some digging, talked to her manager, and was able to upgrade us to a room in the remodeled Grand Tower, AND on the 17th floor with amazing views of the strip!!! Sophia, you are a godsend! (and it was only her first month at the front desk!!)

CASINO: Special shout out to blackjack dealers Alex and Jojo, and pit manager Kris. You guys made our night!!! We came back from the club and decided to hit the slots and tables, so from 6:30am to lord knows when, we were entertained by this lovely group of dealers\/managers. We gambled enough to get our 2nd night comped, which truly made this a fantastic trip! 

VALET: I can't count how many attendants are running around constantly LOL but for as many staff as they have, its about a 20-30 minutes wait for your car. We lost our ticket but thankfully they were able to find the car and were super nice about it. The attendants could be a little friendlier... but I get it, when you're making 5s and 10s all day, its hard to be nice to everyone. 

RESTAURANTS: The District offers a large selection of restaurants, and food court. We went to Avenue Cafe (breakfast,) PUB (lunch\/dinner) and TAP (sports bar.) The food is ok, the prices are high as you should expect them to be for 1) its vegas and 2) its inside a hotel, but overall the convenience of not having to walk or cab anywhere to get some grub is worth it. You may find that all the restaurants look empty, don't let that deter you from trying it out! That happened to us at the PUB, we almost turned around because it was empty but it was the best burger and best fries ever!!!

The main reason we went to MGM was the pool. Pool area is huge. Lots of options and a lazy river. They are standard Vegas and get you with everything high price. Expensive beers, more money to get into special club pool area. But that's normal stuff for Vegas.

Many of the rooms have been recently renovated and they are great, we opted for the King Suite which was well worth the cost being the size of most studio apartments equipped with living room, desk\/work area, king size bed, excellent views and an amazing bathroom with 2 showers (which you never think you need until you are running late and both people need to shower at the same time...which then the 2 showers becomes ahhmazing).

Staff here was friendly and really helpful when there was a snafu on our final bill. 

The only thing that I didn't like is that the gym guests can use for free is just a cardio room with absolutely no weights or other machines. The cardio equipment is old and not well maintained - many of the tvs didn't work, sound didnt' work or the equipment wouldn't move without making god awful noises. BUT if you pay $10 (per visit) you can use the nice gym where everything is extremely well maintained. In fact two days while we were working out there a staff member was going around machine by machine to test them...a suggestion MGM...maybe have that staff member visit your cardio room as well. 

I know it's not a big deal to most people in Vegas, but it is for me, and I really don't like having to pay $10 on top of all the other fees to workout in a nice space. I think that's how most people feel as well because there was never another person in that fitness center which is a shame because it's one of the best I have seen at a resort.",6,0,2

Drinks- many bars varying in quality.   Tabu was decent if a little small.   Some of the other bars on the casino level were good for a mid-day drink, or watching a game, but I would not go at night over the bigger spots.  

Pool- very nice, very hot people, the cabanas are not obscenely over priced.   

All in all ok, depending on what you are looking for out of your experience.   For my personal gambling\/nightlife there are more fun spots.   But if you are looking for a super nice room, and decent table games this could well be your place.",1,0,1

We stayed for 6 days last week and we were in Las Vegas for our wedding.  When we told them it was our wedding they sent champagne and strawberries to our room that night.  We asked for a strip view room that was located on a high floor which was not accommodated but it is what it is.

We didn't eat at any of the higher end restaurants nothing really caught our eye but Tap's was good, quick, and reasonably priced.   

Here is a little known secret if you are staying there go to the Ka show bar.  Go to the Ka show in general it is amazing but if you get a refillable Ka cup for a mixed drink you can get 10 dollar refills Wednesday through Saturday nights and they are 32 ounce drinks.  It's actually a good deal.

The casino was nice minus them taking all of our money but that was what we expected.  We played a lot of craps and the dealers were awesome and helped us out with questions and didn't make us feel like we were out of place for not being Craps sharks.  

The MGM is huge and it is easy to get turned around in.  Check out and check in was easy for us but we arrived on a Tuesday night around midnight and checked out Monday morning at 5:30 so we didn't have to wait in lines.  I liked that it was connected to the monorail which we used a few times.

The pool was nice too.  We stayed in a Tower Spa Suite and the room was nice.  The jacuzzi tub is why we booked the room but the enamel on the tub was peeling off.  We told the bell hop about it and he just told us that is how it is so you can tell it's older.  There was some staining on the caulking around the shower and what looked like rust stains through out the bathroom but the room was perfect for what we needed it to be.  

I would go back again I liked the location.  The other side of the strip I feel like is much more busy and filled with drunks and is at times trashy.  At least at MGM you get the best of both worlds it's not as trashy as the other side of the strip but you can still walk to what you want.

I also liked that it had a food court.  THat made getting food quickly and cheaply possible.  It is also about a block from an ABC liquor store and a convenience store so you get snack and whatever else you want for cheap.",0,0,0

I'm not sure where all the complaints about the rooms come from, or I must have just lucked out. Our room was on the 20th floor and had a king bed. Everything in the room was very nice (beds very comfortable, shower pressure great, everything immaculately clean) and we had a nice view, too. The room was definitely spacious and even had a couch and desk, definitely did not feel crammed in the slightest.

We spent most of our time at this casino. It seems to have a lot going on for it and I'll do a quick run down of everything...

Restaurants: They have a lot of nice fine dining restaurants. Craftsteak, Wolfgang, Joel Robuchon, etc. TIP: Mostly all of these restaurants have a ""Winter Tasting Menu"" going on right now, and they do the same for summer, fall, etc. It offers you a 3-4 course meal at a greatly discounted price. Some of the cheaper ones included Fiamma and Wolfgang for $45\/person for 3 courses which is a steal. Definitely take advantage of that! The cheaper, more casual establishments seem to be fewer here. They have 'wichcraft, the casual sandwich place, the buffet, and a deli\/restaurant. 

Lounges\/clubs: I didn't go to any of the clubs but the bars\/lounges they have around the restaurant are nice. I got two great drinks in them, one was a Lychee Martini, the other something called ""The 75"" which was St. Germain, champagne and lemon juice...delicious. At one of the bars the bartenders get up and dance on the tables every so often. Most of them don't have very good service, a bartender being straight out rude while we asked for the drink menu, telling us to ""go find one."" We left. 

Gambling: Well, I had no luck gambling here and blew a lot more money than I intended to. However, my family mostly all won at least over $700. I think I just have bad luck in general. Also the waitresses take a looong time to come around with drinks, but that seemed to be anywhere!",2,0,0

First, I booked a room block with them for a wedding party. Seemed pretty reasonable, just needed a location close to my venue. When I tried to coordinate gift bags for out of town guests, they basically said that I was SOL. I let that go, but was annoyed as every wedding I've been to in the last several years seemed to have no trouble getting the hotel to pass out a bag at check-in. 

We had the rehearsal dinner at Crush restaurant, which is what made the place get a second star. Crush was outstanding (and they will get their own review). But as we wandered through the casino, there was way more smoking than in the other casinos we were spending time in. This may not be a downside for everyone, but it was definitely noticeable. 

Then, we went to the Cirque show Ka, there. The show was good. The ticket process was ridiculous. We arrived about an hour before the show to pick up our tickets at will call, thinking we'd also have time for a drink before the show. No such luck. They didn't have a separate will call line for the ticket booth, and they only had 3 windows open. We waited in line for 45 minutes for tickets we had already paid for. Then, they were seating people around us (front and center orchestra) AFTER the show had started. I'm certain it was because they couldn't say no to people who were only late because they'd been standing in that ridiculous line. 

All in all, not impressed. If I were to do it over again, I'd have gone with a slightly more expensive room block at a much nicer hotel, and never again will I attend a show there.",3,0,2

If you are gonna selfpark, use the entrance on Koval Ln, and not the one on the Strip. Not only you avoid the crazy traffic on Las Vegas Blvd, through Koval you can immediately access the parking structure. Wish I knew that on the first day. Also, I do have mixed feeling about paying 10 dollars a day for selfparking, at least we get to park ""for free"" at the other hotels owned by MGM during your stay, such as Aria, Bellagio, Mandalay, New York New York, Luxor, among a few others.

I checked in on a friday afternoon, I believe it was around 1-2pm. That lobby was packed, there was literally hundreds of people there, but the queue moved fast. Check in time is 3pm, but the nice lady at the font desk let us go to our room earlier free of charge. They do charge a 32 dollars a day ""resort fee"", like most major Vegas hotels, which I find a bit disingenuous, but what are you gonna do?  Man, this hotel is huge. It felt like we had to walk miles to get to our room on the west wing. The elevator was super fast, though, it only took a couple of seconds to go up and down several floors. I believe those room on the west wing are the smallest and cheapest, but they were spacious, comfortable and clean. The decor was up to date and it had a flat screen TV with several HD channels. No fridge or microwave though. If you are a light sleeper, the noise of planes constantly arriving and taking off at the nearby airport might be an issue. The room was not bad at all, but in a future visit I would gladly shell out a little more money to get a better, closer to the action room.

There is a Walgreens and a CVS nearby so you can buy cheaper drinks and snacks for your room.

As I have said, this place is huge and it take a couple of days for you to get used to it. The casino is huge, there are tons of fancy and expensive restaurants, but there is also a food court with more frugal options. I love the pool complex and spent pretty much every afternoon during my stay there. There are also various stores and attractions on the premises. On the back of the hotel there is a monorail station, so you can get as far as the stratosphere without too much walking. A single use ticket costs 5 dollars, but you can also purchase a pass that will give unlimited rides for a period of days.

The service was okay. A little bit cold, but at least it was fast and got us on our way. All we wanted to do was get to our rooms and get settled in anyways!

Now the room we got to was interesting. We got one of the West Wing rooms, and we found out that the best way to get there was though the West Wing Bar. Take the normal elevators, and if you got a West Wing room expect a long walk. It was the trippiest moment in my life, I kid you not. I thought that there was a mirror at the end of the hallway, but nope, it was actually another couple walking towards us! Seriously, the hallway was so long I couldn't believe it. Good thing we found the west wing elevators.

The room left a very big impression. Yes, it is small. Very small. The first thing you see is the sink in your bathroom. Overall though, very comfortable room. The bathroom is clean, the shower actually drains properly, the water heats up fast, and the bed is comfortable and not scratchy. I actually slept very well during my stay, which is not typical! The pillows were to die for. I wish I took one home with me. 

The only complaint I had is that the walls are super thin. I constantly felt jumpy because every time someone opened or closed the door, I thought they were entering our room. Oh, and that the bathroom counter was too small. I'm a young, vain woman, and I needed my counter space. There wasn't enough space for me to lay out my makeup!

The place is so big and is also the home of a lot of big entertainers and sporting events.  MGM Grand will also lead you to Top Golf.  And by the way, Lyft ranked Top Golf their Number #1 bar destination in Vegas.  I don't think it's a coincidence.  Tourist and locals love the MGM.  As for me, I'm over it.

Let's start with the pros:
The lazy river. It really is awesome. They open the gate for it at 10- people start lining up at 9:30 so fight your hangover and just get down there, it is worth it. There are about five or six pools, as well. One of them is supposed to be an adult only pool but naturally, there were kids there. One would think adults wouldn't bring their children to an adults only pool but just like every other tourist hotspot, you will be surprised. 

Housekeeping was great. 

The buffet is bomb. I don't really know why people are complaining about it, we really enjoyed it. 

The food court is super convenient, with lots of choices. Tons of small shops too. 

Nice rooms and if you're lucky, you will get an awesome view. We were lucky and had an awesome view of New York, New York. 

There is a monorail station at this hotel. USE THIS! It has 7 stops at basically everything you will want to see, and with the temps reaching 110, I guarantee you'll thank me. 

The cons-

Paid for the early check in and planned our flight around this. We got there and the room wasn't ready for the time they said it would be, and we had to wait for two hours. So don't even bother with that option because you will just leave your luggage with them and have to go kill time, the room won't be ready. We initially got a king view room but had to settle for a double queen because it was ready before a king. We did get reimbursed for the early check in fee. 

DO NOT TAKE ITEMS OUT OF THE FRIDGE unless you want to be charged for it. On our first night there, we were basically geeking out at the ridiculous items in there, and a couple hours later checked our account on the tv and had a 64 dollar charge for all the items we simply picked up and put right back down. We called the front desk immediately and they said they would take the charges off after someone came up to confirm that we didn't use the items. It was confirmed the next day and the charges were gone. However, when we checked out, got home and checked our account, the 64 dollar charge reappeared. This was a pretty scummy move considering if I hadn't checked my bank account, it would have gone unnoticed. Yeah, there is a sticker on the fridge that states removing items from the fridge may result in charges, but so small I could barely read it which is why there was no mind paid to it. 

The shower drained really slow and on a hot day the last thing I want to do is stand ankle deep in filth. 

Wrapping it up, I'd recommend this resort- But I also recommend checking your bank account a couple times a day while you are there and upon returning home because they really will overcharge you on the smallest things. Playing with people's money is a no no, so is taking advantage of people who don't know any better.",1,1,1

We were given renovated rooms which were nicely done and near the elevators.    It is an enormous hotel and and that shorter trek down the hallway was nice when dragging in from the pool and nighttime activities.  Speaking of the pool, we rented a cabana for the day and I highly recommend it.  Well worth the money!  I recommend cabana #13 or #14 as they seemed to have the most shade.  They are also right by the lazy river, which was great since it was 106.  The food and drink service was great and delicious.  My only complaint about the room was the shower was either really hot water or lukewarm water. The bed was absolute heaven and super comfy.  It has a monorail station, but the cabs are cheaper, so if you have a party of four or more, the cab is the way to go.  We went from MGM to Caesar's for $8.  The monorail is $5 per person each way.  The only restaurant we ate at in the MGM was the cafe, and it should be avoided.  We waited 45 minutes for our breakfast, and it had clearly been sitting in the kitchen for a while.

 I hate to give this review to MGM, however Mlife is representing you. am a current Mlife member and I wanted to reach out after feeling very disappointed with the service I have received. My biggest concern is that I am unable to utilize the calendar on your website along with all my current offers to see which weekends I get the best discounts! I was always able to do it before. Now after selecting the hotel along with the offer I want to use, I either get a message that says ""Sorry, there is a system error, please call"" or I get a message that says ""unfortunately the selected offer is not available for the selected dates."" I have read the terms and conditions for each of my offers for each of the hotels, I am choosing dates within the availability of the offer time frame. It is easy for an Mlife employee to tell me to call and they can assist, however the problem is that I am very busy and booking online is most convenient to me. Also booking online usually allows me to play with the dates to see which weekends are better priced. I generally decide what weekend I'm coming based off rates, of course I want the best deals and perks that's why I use Mlife. It's One of the reasons I went with Mlife over the other Vegas competitors. 

The other issue I have experienced was actually finding a moment to call and book my one year wedding anniversary stay only to have it cancelled a couple hours later. I had to move a business meeting around last minute so that I could find time to call yet again to see what the issue was with my reservation. I was told my MGM August 5-7th reservation was cancelled because I have another reservation at another Mlife hotel (Aria) that is with 48 hours of each other. I let the agent know that the information was completely incorrect. I will be there on July 29-31st and then August 5-7th, however the two stays are much more than 48 hours apart. The agent confirmed this then proceeded to tell me she had no idea why it was cancelled. That's horrible!! Luckily I was able to find time to call again and luckily I saw the email notification or else my wedding trip to Vegas might not have happened or worst, I would arrived only to find out my reservation was cancelled for no reason. The money was being processed for a refund so the agent asked me to pay a new deposit. I refused as I don't agree with having my card charged twice and have my money tied up because of a mistake you all made. She re-instated my reservation and told me I could pay for the entire reservation upon checkin, which was only the right thing to do. 

The issue with the website is my biggest complaint! I am very busy and not being able to use a tool that you all advertise and claim to make available to your members is ridiculous. It has now been at least 2 months and this issue has not been resolved. The agents also could not help, as they say ""that's another department. "" I did let the agents know that I booked both of my upcoming stays with,  however nothing has been resolved. I am truly thinking of switching to the Total Rewards program that Caesars Palace offers. I have been on their site and it works with no issues. The Mlife website not working temporarily is ok, things happen, but it has been months with no fix. I haven't been able to book as often as I would like due to this inconvenience and have missed out on some great Mlife perks and offers. There is no use having a reward program that I can't use. Internet works best for me to book! This is totally unacceptable and I am one very unhappy member. If I hadn't got married at MGM last August, I would have chosen a different hotel at full rate. I actually love the hotel or else I wouldn't have gotten married there, however the Mlife service or lack there of is pushing me to the edge.

Anytime they give you a map to help navigate you know the area is massive.  Whether your fancy is swimming, hot tubbing (which is crazy during the summer), or lazy river-ing it up then you are at the right place.  Or if you are like me and like to uh ""people watch"" then check it out!

Also if you plan on checking the strip out... I'd recommend cabbing it somewhere and walking.  Kind of a hike!

If you're not one of the high rollers, I feel that the service is generally crap, I inhale tons of smoke, and overpay for bagels.  How nice to have arrived at the MGM Grand West Wing and been pleasantly surprised.  Note:  the West Wing rooms are different from the other rooms in the main part of the hotel.  The rooms are nice and modern; somewhat in the direction of the rooms at the various W Hotels, if you've ever stayed there (but put a star next to that b\/c you aren't paying $300+\/night to rest your lil' tired head at the MGM Grand).  The showers and door to the bathroom were frosted glass and there's a TV in the bathroom.  The radio is a nice Bose radio that could devour most other alarm clock radios in other hotels in which I've stayed.  DVD player in room.  Overall, a cool room (we didn't mind being a 15+ minute walk from the parking garage).

There is a great lounge bar called the West Wing Bar on the first floor in this area of the hotel.  The drinks are kind of expensive ($10\/cocktail) but well-built.  The music is cool and they have great couches to slouch around in.  The only thing that could suck for you is that it's a thoroughfare for people to get from point A to point B so there is a lot of foot traffic.  However, we couldn't figure out what points A and point B were.  The key here is whether you enjoy drinking and people watching and making up little conversations about the people who walk by.  Assuming that you aren't confined in a mental hospital, this might be the place for you.  For example, we like weird little things so we thought it was awesome when a guy came by and set two bananas down on a table along with a glass of rose filled with ice.  Why'd he do that?  And then the waitress kept coming by and calling us ""kids"" and kept trying to help us manage our light sources (lamps), which made us howl when she walked away and try to figure out if she was wearing pants.

When our remote control turned up missing (not a result of over consuming at the West Wing Bar) they brought a new one up in 5 minutes!

The pool complex is great; they have an adults only pool and, although I have no problem with kids, this pool seemed to be deserted...so we hung out there a lot.  They also have a lazy river you can float down which looked like fun but I didn't try.

The casino is like every other casino to me...bling-bling, yeah, yeah, who-hoooooo, Wheel...of...FORTUNE!  Doesn't that WOF slot machine freak you out too?

I'm normally not a big ""Vegas fan"" but had a fantastic time at the MGM Grand and will definitely make it back there at some point.

If you are staying at the MGM and are going to be spending more than $500 there or in any of their properties (NYNY, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Aria, etc), make sure you sign up for their Prima VIP program at check-in! They offered it to us, and we got  upgraded to a bungalow suite and a bunch of other perks, including discounted drinks, VIP entry to their clubs, and free gym and spa access! 

****My Review****

MGM is a great place to stay. Here's what I liked about it:

**Hello, there are REAL LIONS in the lobby. 
**There's a Fat Tuesdays in the lower level. A little grain alcohol to start guarantees a good night. 
**There's a stand called 32 degrees in the studio walk that sells $4 jager shots. Also a good way to ramp up your night. 
**MGM has many excellent restaurants, including the only Michelin 3 star in Vegas (there's only 9 in the entire country period), Joel Robuchon. If you have some cash to burn, definitely eat here - it's amazing. NobHill was also good and the happy hour at Seablue is worthwhile. 
**Tom Collichio's Wichcraft: The sandwiches are soooo delicious. They use REAL meat. We grabbed lunch here many times and brought it to the pool. Be sure to get the egg, bacon, gorgonzola and frisée  breakfast sandwich! Go here, not the food court.
**There are 4 bars; some of them offer discounted drinks with the Prima deal.
**The bed is comfy (and bedbug free - yep, we did a full inspection). 
**The bathroom in the bungalow suite is huge. 
**The lazy river is a lot of fun. There are also 5 pools here, including an adult only pool (Directors). We never made it to Wet Republic but I heard it's a fun scene.

Things I didn't like so much:

**Our non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke. 
**The towels also smelled like stale smoke. Even the new ones delivered every day.
**For a suite, I was expecting a flat screen TV. When I opened the entertainment center and saw a crappy 25-inch Sharp from 1990, I was surprised. But, we weren't in Vegas to watch TV so it didn't really matter than much.",7,3,3

The rooms were really far from the check in. And the elevator situation was confusing. The floors were really long and we couldn't tell which way to go to find the elevators. Signage could be improved. 

The room we got was small. The bathroom area was a really awkward, European style. The door separating the toilet from the room was glass that didn't close and didn't provide any sound protection so I hope you're comfortable with your roommate. The shower door opened away from the counter and didn't really have a place for a towel so I literally stepped out of the shower dripping wet and walked to get a towel above the toilet.

On Jul 28, 2016, at 11:37 PM

Mr. James Murren (CEO), 

I'm writing this email to you directly as a very frustrated and disappointed patron of your hotel MGM Grand Hotel.  

Just a few hours ago (on 7\/28\/2016), I brought my wife and two young children to watch the Jabbawockeez show (7pm show) at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel. 

After the show, my family and I made our way to the hotel lobby area to exit the hotel and Uber back to our hotel (Elara).  I was walking ahead with my son, while my wife and daughter trailed behind. 

I turned around and my wife was on the floor after she slipped on a puddle of liquid on the tile lobby floor (in front of the front desk guest reception area). 

As soon as I saw my wife, I ran to her because I know she has a bad knee. In fact, just a few days ago, her left knee cap had slipped in and out and she was forced to wear a knee brace. She said when she slipped this evening on the wet MGM lobby floor, she felt her knee slip in and out yet again because of the fall.  If she didn't have the brace on, we can't imagine how serious tonight's injury could have been. 

Moments prior to my my wife falling, another couple walked through the same area and this female guest slipped and fell.  They were instructed to go to security and as they pointed to the area where the incident occurred, they saw that my wife was now on the floor too. 

The man and woman came over to us on the lobby floor and quickly told us they just experienced a fall on the same location.  It was only after this SECOND slip on MGM property that a grounds keeper came and attempted to wipe up the very big puddle of liquid on the floor.  This MGM employee then suggested to all of us (including the other couple) that we go to the side of reception and file a report with security. 

I'm writing to you to explain in detail how utterly mismanaged this whole process was and how incredibly incompetent your front desk staff was. They responded without any urgency and offered us absolutely no assistance during this entire ordeal. 

After my family moved my wife to a lobby sitting area. I, along with the other couple, walked over to security. We were met by a security employee named ""Person 1"". This was about 8:35pm. She said she was calling someone to come and take our ""report"". After waiting 15-20 minutes, nobody came and that is when I pressed her to find someone. I asked for a manager and she got on a call again and told me that a (Supervisor) or (Asst. security mgr) would come down to meet us.  Nobody came. 

At this point, I gave up on Person 1, who was also busy managing lost-and-found issues.  I walked to the reception area and asked sternly for a hotel manager or supervisor because it was very clear nobody at the front desk was even aware that 2 hotel guests has just fallen right in front of their reception desk. 

It was only after my request, that your assistant manager - came over to me.  I explained to Asst Mgr what had happened and he expressed his concerns for the situation but did not offer any real immediate assistance. Instead, he got on the phone and talked for several more minutes while I stood and continued to wait for some mysterious person to take our ""report"". 

I expressed my dissatisfaction, as any normal person would in our situation, and made clear to Asst Mgr that I would like a hotel manager or supervisor to come and handle this issue promptly.  We were nearing 30+ minutes since my wife's fall and my wife, 2 kids and and I were all getting tired and anxious.  He said if we left the hotel grounds -- there would be nothing he could do for us.  Not the kind of support you'd expect to hear from an assistant manager. 

At this point, a security person (""security person"") finally came to the hotel lobby.  Nobody else arrived (as Person 1 initially indicated). Instead security person, a regular security officer (as he explained) came to us. He said he just literally arrived to the hotel and knew nothing of the situation.  He spoke with us and the other couple briefly. We explained and showed him where the fall occurred.  It was clear ""security person"" was sent to just process the situation. 

I explained yet again to another one of your jr employees how unhappy we were with the hotel's lack of urgency and support. ""Security Person"" obliged and recognized how frustrating that it was for all of us, but was clear he was in no power to help. He asked my wife if she could walk over to the security office to write up the report.  Really? She just fell on the floor. And her knee cap popped in and out. She was in discomfort  and he wants her to walk over to the office?! After waiting nearly 40 minutes for some help, we get this?!?

My husband and I recently stayed at the MGM Grand, we had a wonderful time while we were here.

My only qualm is that the toilet\/shower is just separated by a glass door.  Not the greatest for when you have to take care of...business. We quickly developed a system of turning the water on to cover up any issues that may arise. This might not be the best room to stay in if you're staying with someone that you're not married to, etc. As i said, there's no ""dressing area"", as the bathroom is open.

Make note at check in, you get charged ""resort fees"" AND they will charge your card $100 dollars a night as a ""hold"" on your funds. Normally I've always paid resort fees at check-out. Anyways, my husband and I after having a bad flight experience and an even worse rental car experience, showed up absolutely exhausted after traveling all day and just wanted to eat and check into our room. Our bank ended up putting a hold on our funds because of all the out of state charges that showed up on our cards. We arrived at the hotel and were told we could not check in unless our resort fees were paid and it was put on a card with an ADDITIONAL $300 dollars for the ""hold."" It was 9pm. Our hotel room stay was pre paid through Vegas.com which was $700 dollars for a three night stay. They had their money already for the room that we had paid in full months prior, but told us if we didn't pay the resort fees, we could not stay that night. Are you kidding me? We paid for the room already but we couldn't stay there if the $119 dollar resort fees weren't paid. We were scrambling because our bank wouldn't release the hold on our cards until the next morning. After begging.........literally begging.....and pleading......the ""manager"" agreed to let us check in with $50 dollars down in agreement the remainder would get paid the next morning. You guys, ALL OUR MONEY WAS TIED UP FROM THE BANK PLACING A HOLD ON IT. Me and my husband had to scrounge and come up with $50 bucks to finally check into our room. We hadn't eaten in over 8 hours and again, had zero access to funds until the morning. I figured we would call room service and charge food to the room and pay it upon checkout. NOPE!!! MGM wouldn't allow us to order room service because we didn't pay the full ""resort fees."" So we went to bed starving. The next morning we paid the remaining balance of $69 dollars and they placed their lovely hold on our additional $300 dollars. Money we wanted to have for our trip for spending. Again, our hotel room had already been paid for for 3 nights. And this was how we were treated. DO NOT STAY HERE. This place is a joke and clearly do not care about their guests at all. Also, plan on spending a RIDICULOUS amount of money if you want to have an alcoholic beverage at their pool. Notice I said ""a alcoholic beverage."" Not multiple.

*The check-in was not a problem for me. Many people have found it an issue when they have reviewed it on Yelp. I found the staff to be swift in action and super-helpful. We did not even have to wait for too long to see the friendly check-in assistant. 

*The pools were all great, but can get pretty busy in there! 

The good things about the room we had (Main Hotel) were that the bathroom was finished to a high standard and spacious. I loved the view over The Strip. The window sill was nice and low, and had decent headroom. The windows could have done with a clean though.

Thirdly, every time we contacted the concierge, bell or front desks, we were treated with respect and the utmost hospitality.  Any questions or problems we had were addressed immediately.  We were even able to procure some photos for the Yelp Goose Chase Scavenger Hunt just by asking.  We had a few days to relax and even venture to the pool which was excellent.  I was sad that I didn't get to go to Wet Republic though.  I did hear from someone that the admission is waived for hotel guests but I don't know if that's true or not since it's normally $25.  Thanks so much to the staff at the MGM Grand for treating us so well.  I'll be sure to stay there again next time I'm looking for a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.",8,6,8

Located on the south end of the strip, it's a great starting point. We've stayed here countless times, w\/or w\/o kids! The MGM  has been our favorite because of their pool area! Great either with or without kids! 

Our first visit was grand! That was over ten years ago! They put us in a suite, with plenty of room for the four of us! 

Fast forward to present. So we've noticed that when you book a room now, just two of us, no kids, they put you in a smaller room, on the far, inconvenient side of this grand hotel! We upgraded on this last trip because of the bad prior experience. The last stay we had with MGM was at that far side of the resort and the room we had was rinky dink! Oh, and to try to upgrade your room after you check in was a nightmare plus!! 

We knew better this time and upgraded for a fee, voluntarily, upon check in. Hell no! We weren't about to spend four plus hours switching rooms! That's how long it took on a prior visit. So beware! 

We love the MGM but after considering the room that's offered through travel sites and paying upgrades, you may want to check around!",33,16,27

I have been to Vegas several times and I think I have found my go to hotel to stay in. You can get a much cheaper rate across the street at Excalibur but will wind up paying the differences in taxis to get what you want elsewhere as MGM has everything you could need. I stayed 5 nights in a standard room in the west\/grand tower. The room was nothing fancy but clean, modern, and served its purpose in Vegas (to shower and sleep). The resort yes is BIG, yes it can take you 10 minutes to walk to the pool, yes you can get lost here, but again.. it has everything. There are several pools to choose from (wet republic being its own separate entity) and a lazy river. I never had a problem finding a chair at the pools and the waitress service was fast. They also have several bars and a to go counter for food. When entering the pool area there is a casual outdoor café which I wound up eating at many times. The entire menu is available all day, so sushi for breakfast it was! Slightly pricey but what can you expect?? Food was good enough for me to go back to several times. I was excited about the lazy river but there are so many people not using floats in it and just hanging out that it was fun to just walk around and not need one. The hotel has many high end restaurants to choose from none of which I wound up eating at but would love to. Plenty of casual places and a food court to choose from as well. The casino is large and has plenty of options to gamble with. As for nightlife every bar seemed to be bustling when we passed and has the obvious choice of Hakasaan. Huge and popular nightclub right there. I saw Calvin Harris and Tiesto while there, find a promoter and girls get in for free\/guys reduced usually. The staff that I dealt with while there was nothing but helpful and pleasant. If you're looking for a resort that has everything you could need for a decent price stay at the MGM!",2,1,1

The pool area looks cool in pictures but they have zero control over the number of ""guests"" allowed in the area.  We tried on two separate days to find just 1 open chair, nothing.  The pool area was packed full of idiots spilling drinks and running into each other

The hotel should have more respect for paying guests and limit those who are allowed in the pool area.  We noticed tons of people getting in who weren't staying at the hotel.  Apparently you can get a pool pass or resort ticket or something?  They also apparently let entire groups in all one card.

There is no separation between bathroom utilities as is suggested in the about the room information on hotel booking sites.

The one resort facility I used was the pool.  Nice pools but they need to improve their operation hours.  On their website and pool grounds they post that the pool area is open from 7:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.  Yet, at 7:30 a.m. only two pools of the five pool areas are open.  Leaving the grand pool, adult pool and lazy river closed to guests until 10:00 a.m.  

Now with a resort fee of $25 and especially during summers with 90+ temps at 7:30 a.m. it would be reasonable to expect that all the pools be open and closed at a later time, possibly 9:00 p.m. when it is still light out.",7,1,2

Only two persons behind the desk, but only one person in line in front of us.  A great feature when you consider how huge the lines can  be to check in at the hotel.  

Got their special price on-line and ended up in their west tower at the end of an extraordinarily long hallway.  This newer wing features small rooms with a single king sized bed and a bathroom that opens into the bedroom.  Virtually no view except that of another building, it seemed almost an interior room.  But who spends that much time in their rooms in Vegas?

Huge casino floor, unlike the New York New York casino across the Strip.  Three big pools and a lazy river where you can rent an inner tube for $16.  Cabanas are $400, which includes food and drink.  Lots of fine dining and a food court in their shopping area where McDonald's is the primary option.  No real mid-priced dining options like the New York, New York casino.  

Hotel entrance is on Tropicana Ave.  Front door on Las Vegas Blvd. opens into a large area that almost seems abandoned or under construction.  However, at night the open spaces are used for the lines of Gen Y members heading into the big clubbing scene.  Casino still a very smoky place.

I've visited Vegas probably 20 times the last few years but decided to change it up this trip.  Upon entering the lobby we were greeted with a huge line that took us about a hour to finally get a room key.  This was a little annoying but not surprising considering its the famous MGM at 2 PM check in time.  We were quite satisfied with our room initially... It was at midnight when we returned from a late night show and when we went to bed, we flipped over one of the pillows and noticed a disgusting stain on the bedsheet right at the head of the bed (see picture).  I immediately called housekeeping and was told they would send someone right away. Half hour goes by and still no one.  I call again.  This time a different lady answers the phone and assures me she will inform management and send someone.  The wife and I fall asleepon the other ""clean"" side of the bed and get a loud knock on the door at 145 AM (1 hour and 45 mins after the first call).  The housekeeping guy hands me over a fresh, folded bed sheet and proceeds to walk out.  I stop him and imply if I am to place this over the stain.  He responds by apologizing for coming so late and blames the previous shift for not showing up and confirms that the new bed sheet is to be placed over the stain.  I was like WTF??!?!?!  WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS??  I didn't make a fuss of it because we were so tired and was going to deal with it the next day instead.  Needless to say I was appalled with MGM's level of service for something so simple.  What a disappointment.

I booked this reservation through Expedia so I got an email that the reservation was guaranteed until midnight of the first day of the reservation.  Seeing as my flight was going to come in at 11:50 I decided to give MGM Grand a call since I didn't want my room to be given away.

It was a 15 minute or so wait on hold to reach the correct person, but she was very polite and wrote a note on my reservation so the room wouldn't be reissued.

Our flight came in around 2AM local time (Spirit Airlines, that's a 1 star review for another time).  The check in people were nice and we got our room keys quickly without a hitch.

Once we got into our room, it was a little weird.
-The soaps were already opened. Not sure if they are just really trying to make things easy on me or didn't change them out. I found a hair in the soap...
-There was still trash in the trash can.

Ehhh.

No matter, we brought our own soap anyway and trash is trash. We were tired.

The rest of the stay was uneventful.  The buffet was okay since it was included in our stay, but if you're looking for a Vegas Buffet worth talking about with friends, head up the strip to some of the newer casinos.  The MGM Grand buffet reminded me of dorm food. Since I just got out of college it's not a big deal, but if your palate is more refined then you might be better off paying more and going elsewhere.

The casino is cool. Again, there's better on the north end of the strip, but nothing is terribly bad or exceptionally good.

My one regret about being at MGM was not going to Hakkasan. It had just opened and we were busy with other venues so we didn't check it out.  But after reading other reviews it seems like I missed out on a golden opportunity.  I'll be sure to check it out next time.

Some final notes -

-MGM is in a good location since you can hit a bunch of casinos thanks to the rail that is connected to Excalibur down the road. One can easily hit up Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, Luxor, and NYNY.
-The pools are great and check out Wet Republic if you get a chance.
-Weekday rates are pretty reasonable.
-There is a $25\/day resort fee that gets added on. It includes WiFi so bring a computer or tablet since you're already paying for access.
-There is a foodcourt between the hotel and pools if you are trying to save some cash.",2,1,1

We stayed on the 16th floor, the view kinda sucked since you only saw the end of the strip, plus the valet area down below. The beds were comfy, but there was no fridge to keep our road trip junk food in. Room came with a desk and some chairs, and there's a ledge by the window you can sit on. The room was always clean, fresh towels, beds made, etc. when we came back to our hotels from wherever. The maids were nice and always greeted us when they heard our sandals *clop clop* as we walked to the pool or wherever.

The Lion Habitat was kinda interesting, though we didn't go in. The lions seemed really calm, and the dude on the speakerphone was saying how there's four layers of glass or some crap so they can't hear anyone outside and they're incredibly relaxed. They had the lion trainers walk into the habitat too with the lions, and the lions just lounged there as they normally do. But I swear, I think I saw a trainer crap himself a little.

I remember only eating at the McDonald's and Seablue, a seafood restaurant. Seablue is one of my favorite restaurants, EVER. I'm not even a big seafood fan, though I do eat it when the opportunity presents itself and have eaten it at fancy restaurants before. Check out my review on Seablue!

I freaking loved the Lazy River, partly because I'm a lazy ass. Show your hotel pass and you get in for free and get free towels, plus you can even bring guests who aren't staying at the MGM. Tube rentals were kinda pricey, but the first day we went to the pools, the computer was broken so they just gave us the tubes for free. We met a couple of friends while having a drink at Seredipity 3 @ Caesar's Palace and they ended up going to the lazy river on another day and the rental place was closed so we just scavenged for tubes and got them for free, again!

One of the times I got carded was at a table of course but the dealer wasn't all that courteous. I wasn't sure if he spoke much English, but whatever. He sorta just blurted out ""ID?!"" out loud the way fobs do when they speak - that is, without a volume switch. He did smile but I was just a bit taken aback. The ladies at the cashier booths were really courteous though.

I had a very pleasant experience here, and so did everyone else who went. The hotel does look sorta dated compared to places like the Wynn and Palazzo, but it was far from ugly or run down. Next time I'll definitely be checking out Rouge or Tabu though, they've got some hot looking servers!",0,1,0

MGM Grand is a nice clean hotel. Its not the PALAZZO but its coo. I wouldn't mind staying there again. Honestly, its really not the hotel you stay at, its who you are with and what you make of the trip. We should have a YELP VEGAS TRIP. 5 stars to that!

SO many funny moments in Vegas, too many to mention. Here's a few that I thought was funny:

FRIEND 1: hey girl, there's an All-you-can-eat MEAT buffet at the MGM GRAND.
GIRL(a little on the fatty side):ooOO foreals!? We are so there!
FRIEND 2: you are so mean, you like to push buttons don't you!?
FRIEND 1: I was being such a jerk and she didn't even realize it!

I have been a rated player at a handful of well known Casinos.  I have stayed at the MGM at least 50 times.  Due to the latest trip I don't think I will ever step foot in MGM again.  After 10 hours of play on their tables in 24 hours, I can't say who was the least friendly or nastier.  The Black Jack dealers, the teams working their Craps tables or the cocktail waitresses.  The entire casino staff acted as if they could care less if you were there and slowed every game down due to their lack of interest in being there themselves.
It seems obvious that the MGM has decided that their interests are in night club and pool clientele and no longer interested in the casino and gaming clients.  We are not the priority.  It is sad because the MGM was an icon on the strip.  Now it is just another corporate mess.",5,1,0

The casino is spacious and smoky.  Should I deduct stars because I lost badly both nights I played here?  Nah.

One must-do activity at the MGM is the Television City pilot-rating thing.  You watch a TV pilot and rate it while it plays.  Afterward, you get some coupons for discounted food.  But it's awesome to share your opinion on new TV shows.

Do not stay here. If you feel like passing through this place avoid it like the plague. From the entrance it took me a good 30 mins to get to the monorail. The craziest part is I knew exactly where I was going and moving as fast as I possibly could. There are so many twist and turns. The place is humongous. When you think you are close to where you want to be you realize quickly that you aren't. Its a maze. They have signs to point you to where you want to go but then signs for that destination will disappear and you get lost super easily.  Take for instance the monorail. I will follow the signs for it and they would disappear and I knew well that I was no where near it. I had to ask people to get to where I needed to go.

Basically, they send us offers for 3 free nights in a deluxe room with free lunch and dinner for EVERY DAY we are there. It's at select restaurants but one of them is the Grand Wok. As long as the bill says two guests, we can pretty much order anything we darn well please and it's all free. Basically, all you can eat sushi, seafood and other asian dishes!

IF we ever paid to stay there, this place would prob get between 2-3 starts.

decent gambling, tons of slots (last time we went, i sat down with $20 bucks at a machine and won $500 in about 10 minutes!)
cocktail waitresses are pretty good about coming back (if you tip them) but it's a pain to wait until they actually show up the first time

water pressure in shower (i'm one of those that likes the shooting water at full speed, minimizes my normally 30-40 minute shower time)

CONS:
place is HUGE, there is way too much walking involved and maneuvering  around sloppy drunken people
Bell Desk = rude, incompetent A$$ (we checked our bags because our room wasn't ready, they said they could not take our bags upstairs for us when we were ready to check in. Then these stupid frat boys walk up and I see the bellhop rolling their luggage up for them.....riiiight...)
late checkout--having to get up at the crack of dawn to ask for it. although, everytime we've requested it, we've always gotten it.
Player's Club -- watch your comps, don't expect them, you have to make up your room price etc... before they even think about giving you comps!

I've stayed here a few times in the past, mostly when this resort was still new and had all the OZ theming.

This is a review of my last stay at this hotel, which was years back. I vowed to never return and still haven't.

It took WAY too long to check in, and it was close to 11 PM at night. When we finally got to our room, it took us no longer than 10 minutes to discover the room INFESTED with a colony of ants. HOW THE FUCK does a hotel room 20+ floors above ground get infested with ants? They were EVERYWHERE. Running in a single-file line up and down the curtain drapes, they were IN the bed sheets, and all along an entire wall base. I have never seen anything like this before.

We called the front desk to have them move us immediately and they said it would take half an hour before they could relocate us to another room. So our whole group just waits in the hallway for a hotel rep to meet up with us. Finally, nearly an hour later, we were escorted to another room on a different floor. We go inside and mull over how ridiculous that this is happening to us.

Then it just gets better with room #2. There are blood stains on our bed comforters and cum stains in our sheets AND it's not like we had to go looking for them. They were some fatty stains that were screaming to be discovered; left behind by a previous guest that decided she would carelessly discharge her ""that-time-of-the-month"" vaginal wine into the bedspread. Thanks lady!

We phone the front desk again in outrage. They really could not give a shit. Twenty minutes later, housekeeping arrives with a different set of bed linens.

We leave our rooms and head out to the strip in disgust. How hundreds of ants and body fluid stained bedding can go unnoticed by hotel staff is completely ridiculous. This would be something I would not be surprised to see at Circus Circus, but the MGM Grand? I can stomach a boring, tasteless, and sterile hotel room ANY day, but I draw the line at bedding stains and insect infestations.

Every visit prior to my last visit here was a 2 Yelp Star Rating experience at best. Bt that was when the MGM Adventures Theme Park was still around though (where The Signature towers now stand).",23,15,5

As a big aviation fanatic, my favorite rooms are the ones that overlook the airport.  Weird as that might sound I actually find it relaxing to watch that the odd times I'm in my room and it's a nice respite from views of the strip, or worse, the dreaded ""no view of anything much"" which is common with many of the strip hotels and which cause you to just keep the curtains shut all the time.

Eating options are also great here, I especially like the Japanese restaurant (Shibuya I think it's called) and there's a Chinese place too.  Both are good quality and about $50-60 for a meal.  There's also an okay food court, good for an emergency.

This has a good casino too, but if you're playing tables there are cheaper options for most games, (e.g. head over to Excalibur or New York New York) which are just a few minutes walk.  In fact the location of this hotel is great because you can get to many of the other major hotels on the strip real quickly which opens up a whole new world of options for anything.

For conventions, this hotel really is the greatest - they have some phenomenal huge conference facilities, and the exercise getting from your room to them will help you offset the calories you consume on these trips!

However, because of the fact I've only really stayed at the MGM for business, I just cannot do it for pleasure - I have a stressful job and I have to disconnect, thus I might stop by for a quick visit during a leisure visit to Vegas (as I did just recently) but that's it - but don't let that put you off.  I think that's more just my need to separate work and leisure kicking in, it's a decent hotel no matter how you look at it.",2,0,1

We got to the hotel Sunday morning at 11am and requested an early checkin as we booked one of the 16 penthouses for our ceremony and reception.  The gentleman was very nice and stated that he could probably get us in around 1PM.  Great!  He called housekeeping to ensure there was an open room that could be cleaned as a rush.  He indicated he had our numbers and would call by 2 pm.  NEVER HAPPENED.  Since 3 pm is the POSTED check in, I thought for sure we would get the call be 3.  NOT.    We went back to the hotel at 3:30 to inquire about our room and the desk said the room was still not ready.  We FINALLY got the call at 4:12PM that our room was ready--- then came the 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive from the bell desk.  Ceremony was set to begin at 6:30... Needless to say we had to postpone the ceremony by 30 minutes. FINE.

The room was gorgeous for our intimate ceremony and reception--- I highly recommend it for a non-traditional wedding or 2nd wedding.  The skyline is EPIC AT SUNSET!!

That being said, I was disappointed when the doorbell rang at 8:30AM the next morning.  SERIOUS?  Check out is 10 AM.... Who the hell rings a doorbell that early in the am in Vegas. And they were back again at 9:30.  SHIT. WAIT TILL THE CHECK OUT TIME BEFORE RINGING DOORBELLS!

The ONLY reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the space was perfect for our occasion and when we called for housekeeping, they also brought up additional paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags.  Other than that, the check in service was NOT acceptable... Over an hour late and an add'l hour for luggage. Then the early disturbance in the AM.

Nothing special about this hotel. Beautiful lobby, but there's not much that really differentiates MGM from the other Vegas hotels (except the lions... which were not out on display the entire time we were staying there). 

Rooms are average. Pillows a little on the hard side. Bathrooms are massive, but the shower heads are only high enough for a child to fit underneath. I'm 5'5"" and had to squat underneath (try doing that tipsy - it's no easy feat!).

Selection of restaurants was decent. 

There was a plethora of pools, which was the best thing about MGM... no one pool was ever super crowded, so that made for a very nice day-drinking experience.

(Oh, except for Wet Republic, which had a 3-hour wait to get in, but I suspect that was because it was the pool's opening weekend and Kim Kardashian was there)

We come at least 3X a year and prefer to stay downtown where momma and I can tour around, sipping on a tall drink and enjoy the sights. Free entertainment, people watching. The best thing about downtown is there hospitality. They have the old school Vegas feel and majority make you feel welcomed. You feel like even though you lost, you got something in return.

Not so much on the strip. It's been years since I stayed on the strip but momma wanted to take the kids to a fun property that had a pool for the kids. We decided upon MGM. From my memory, they advertised kid friendly and they had a lazy river. So, lets do this...

Upon arrival, drove up to valet like I always do. I believe in taking care of all services from the valet to the dealers. On any given weekend, I would easily tip $200 total... Drove up and saw they charge a $20 bill for valet. What??? So, if I usually tip a valet server $10 to park it and $10 for return, it's $40 to valet? When the heck did this start??  I talked to the attendant and said that the mandatory charge must really put a dent in their tips. He grunted and said, ""You have no idea, and we don't even work for the hotel.""  Felt bad for the guy but we self-parked.   Again.. What???

Whatever, Are things that hard that MGM has to start bilking its guest for everything?

Walked in and saw 100 people easily waiting for registration. But surprisingly, there were 25 registrants standing by. 20 min wait, no big deal. Kudos for that.

Gave my credit card and saw my bill go up and up and up. The room was $150. Bu wait, there's more... $35 resort fee.. but wait there's more, tax on resort fee $11.00, then the $12.00 parking charge. so, whatever deal you got on your reservations, stand by, increase it everyday by $50.00.  I rented 2 rooms for 2 days. = $200 extra.

I know I am in Vegas and I expect to pay for the weekend, but I expect to also get something for my $.

Went to the 1st room and all was good. Momma and I went to the 2nd room and it reeked of MJ and mildew smell.  Looked around and quickly noticed the beds were made with DIRTY sheets.. The stain was free of charge. About the only free thing we got this weekend. We asked about another room but was denied, ""all booked up.""  They offered a air cleaning machine and new sheets. After 4 phone calls and 2 hrs of waiting, Dealing with the rudest housekeeping rep named Jaunita, the machine finally showed up. It help.. a lot... made the room bearable.  The sheets were changed and we were ready for a nice couple of days. 

1st night we walked around and caught a movie. Woke up and started looking for breakfast for the kids. They had nothing. Absolutely no choices for kids and food for breakfast. they had 1 cafe with an hr wait.. we had no choice, we waited. Average cost of a typical breakfast plate was nearly $19.00. times that by 5 and you have a $120 breakfast. 

Grabbed bags and hung out at pool all day. Awesome pool and surroundings, lazy river, etc... while in a pool we asked for drinks for the kids and us.  Waitress said no prob and returned. Another waitress came by and we asked for a 2nd round.  She needed to see our room key and ID before taking order to place on room charge. I told her it was in my wallet on a chair at the other end of the pool. She said, ""Oh"" and walked away. She returned and I showed her my ID but she didn't bring any drinks. She said she won't take the order unless we have ID. I told her, never mind, we are good.  

She returned with the drinks..huh?? OK, I told her I cancelled the order, she said, ""Oh, well they are already charged to your room."" I said, ""Uncharge them."" I look at my room charges right now and they are still on there. She obviously didn't remove them and didn't care. 

Listen, people come to Vegas to party, spend money and have a good time. MGM takes away from their server's tips by demanding the nickel and dime tactic of charging for everything. I usually will go through $3000 to $4000 gambling at one property per trip. Because of the principle of the matter, I spent less than $100 on the property and took my gambling to other properties.

Here are just a few things that went wrong:
I had reserved, and was paying for, a Tower Suite a couple of months in advance. I got an email confirmation and no where in that email does it say 'based on availability.' When I checked in on June 25th, I was informed that they were sold out and I would have to take a regular room and there was nothing they could do.
When we were walking into our room one night, there was actually a dirty Q-Tip in the hallway in front of our door (we assume it was dropped there from the housekeeping staff).
We got into the elevator and there was cigarette butts and dried beer on the floor. 
We spent over $1200 on a cabana on Saturday. When we got there, it was filthy. There were leaves all over the carpet, it was dusty, there were stains (from God knows what) on the sofa and the bar hadn't been cleaned. We were informed that they don't actually clean the cabanas every day. I asked for the cabana manager and this young woman came and apologized but did NOTHING! Our server (who was very sweet) came in and wiped down all of the dusty surfaces, but no one else ever came in. 
The Director's pool was horrible. All of us (the 3 women) had our bathing suits destroyed by the water. The color was changed and now have to be thrown away. One of my friends actually called the front desk and without even seeing the bathing suit, they gave her a credit. I was too mad to call as I didn't want to take my anger out on someone that didn't have anything to do with it. 
When we got back to the room, after the room had been cleaned, the housekeeper left a pile of dirty towels in our bathroom.
This is just a few of the issues that we had in our very short 4 day stay. I cannot believe what a dump the MGM Grand has become. I'm astonished and, believe me, will never stay there again. It's truly shameful.",0,0,1

I just want everyone to know.....stay away from room 03-320 Tower One Bedroom Suite. We were right under the gym and from 5am-11pm, the whole room shakes when someone gets on the treadmill. Forget about sleeping during these hours. Also, you can hear the trash being moved around outside the bedroom window. 

The room did have a nice view of Tropicana Blvd. The blackout blinds are awesome, I wish all of the hotels had them. The living room area was nice, big couch to relax on. The bathroom layout was nice, too. It would of been nice if the toilet had its own door. The water pressure in the shower is very low, which made the shower time take a little longer.

The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottom of this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D

SHUTTLE PICK-UP

MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.

THE LOWDOWN

My casual hotel run-in \/ grab a bite \/ run-out and hit the strip place.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS

Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:

Social M.
Owner

Dear Michelangelo:

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat. 

The MGM Grand Lion Habitat closed as part of a property wide renovation project. Head trainer Keith Evans will continue to care for the lions at his large desert compound here in Southern Nevada, where the animals have actually spent the majority of their lives. Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.

The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.

Sincerely,

The Guest Experience Department

The place is great, the food and service was wonderful.  Studio 54 was fun, i met some great guys there, the spa and pool were good, and the casinos were nice.  The bedrooms were pretty nice, the bathroom was decent nutin special.  We watched Kaa, which was pretty good but the one at the bellagio was better (O).  Not much shopping in this hotel, if you are looking for shops stay at A paris or ceasar's palace.

My main goals were great bathtub and room service with upside in casino restaurants if I chose. The room was well appointed.  Tub was great. My view was of a recycling bin and dumpster hallway.  I was on the top floor.  #3.  Very underwhelming compared to its name and price. But I figured oh well I'll make the best of it. Prices on room service blew me away. $23 for bacon and eggs?   Fine I'll dine out. Equally abusive pricing throughout entire property. $16 cigarettes.  That's more than NYC!  $15 for a basic gin & tonic. $4 sodas in vending machines. I felt abused after being initially open to giving them my money.   Restaurants were just as underwhelming. It's unfortunate.  But now I know how the tourists feel.  My next staycation will be at a different property.   Really tried to explore and find good new things. But left with a case of ""that'll have to do'",0,0,0

He's been after me to go to Vegas for years but we had to wait until after my knee replacement a couple years ago. Good thing, too, you will walk like you;ve never walked before in Vegas.

That aside, reservations I made on expedia gave us a great rate for 5 nights. We took the first flight out of Omaha and arrived at the hotel lobby probably around 9:45 AM Vegas time. Paid for early check-in which I was glad was available. Only drawback was we did not get the smoking room on a higher floor I had requested; not that big a deal. Didn't wait very long in check-in, staff was most courteous and helpful. Got to our room, everything was ready for us. Changed out of our Midwestern woolens; had a sandwich at the little deli next to the sports book (my introduction to Vegas' high food prices). 

Disappointed that the room did not have a little coffee maker like most hotels in this price range we've stayed at. But I suppose that many little appliances would be a logistical nightmare, and MGM would have to hire a 24\/7 staff of probably 100 people just to handle replacing coffee makers and restocking coffee. Gladly once we found the ""short-cut"" of the West Wing elevators to the West Wing bar, an early morning trip to Starbucks was de rigeuer, and then outside the door by the West Wing bar to sip coffee and smoke cigarettes.

The place is indeed big; if you stay long enough you will learn the tricks and shortcuts like we did. The Monorail station was a huge plus; the jaunt to get to it from our room not so much.

Ate supper at the Avenue Cafe Friday night and breakfast there Sat., Sun. and Mon. Had the brunch buffet the Tuesday morning we left. All great food, very friendly and courteous service (except the server at the buffet wasn't as nice).

We gambled here a lot the first two days we were there, but on weekends they raise the minimum limit on table games out of our budget range. So over the weekend if we gambled here we played slots or video blackjack and poker. Great thing about the casino bar...sidle up to one of those video card games and stick in a $20 bill and bet 25 cents a  hand you can get quite drunk on free magaritas!

I enjoyed everything about our stay...sure, food was pricey but where isn't it in Vegas? The valet parking area sure seems like it runs like clockwork. I would give 5 stars except for the fact I had to get up and go looking for coffee every morning, the minimum limits on table games Friday, Saturday and Sunday were ridiculous and the Rain Forest Cafe was pretty bad. But we would stay here again!",1,0,0

Bad customer service.

They could care less if you'll return  back or not.

If your card gets demagnetized multiple times and it's a well know issue don't expect them to provide a solution or a warning. It is what it is and your inconvenience means nothing. Also poor staff training and communication on mgm part with their staff. 

I suggest better training to be able to prevent problems and better solution in resolving issues. 

Props to maye for the professionalism after the poor customer service from woody and the front desk . I understood the issues but the way it was handled was not appreciated. 

Also walking back I spoke with another dissatisfied customer storming to the front desk with the same exact issue. 

Management, please address the door issue or warn customers that your card won't work because your card can be ""demagnetized "" if placed next your iPhone even if it's been sitting in your wallet.",11,2,1

I think there was a convention in the area so that made the mgm a little more crowded than it was used to.  On to the review.. I got booked into a regular room in the Grand Tower.  I believe there are other regular rooms in the older tower but I'm not too sure.  The grand tower rooms were really great, far from what I expected.  The bed sheets, couch, bathroom were all pretty modern and clean.  The bathroom was kind of small compared to other strip hotels like mandalay, aladdin (planet hollywood), and of course venetian or those all suite hotels.  Anyways, the king size bed was REALLY great, it was soft, clean, and came with a lot of pillows.  

On to the casino.. they spread pretty much every table game imaginable....bj, paigow, baccarat, etc...   The limits were actually lower than I expected..I saw a few $5 blackjack tables during the day but it was obviously bumped up to $15 and $25 later on in the night.  I liked the fact they baccarat in a separate room away from the other games.  The poker room is rather big for a vegas property.  I counted somewhere around 20 tables with most of them being used.  They spread mostly $1\/$2 no limit games with some $3\/$6 limit and another omaha game.  I was there during the day (2pm) so I'm guessing later that night other games could have started as well.  Here's a tip: if you play at least 4 hours during your stay you can qualify for the poker room rate which is only $89.99, far cheaper than the regular price.  That's the lowest they will go down I overheard.

For dinner I ate at the MGM buffet and was satisfied.  It wasn't ""GRAND"" as the hotel name implies but it wasn't bad either.  I thought their crab legs were smaller compared to Wynn or Aladdin.  The prime rib wasn't that flavorful ( expected) but I really like their mac n' cheese!  The shrimp wasn't pre-peeled so that was annoying.  The desserts were not memorable either.  Overall it's a good buffet but nothing spectular.  Also for $23.99 (dinner) it was rather expensive.  Thank goodness I had a $25 restaurant credit.  

In all I would recommend MGM because it pretty much has everything under its roof....10+ restaurants, starbucks, casino, pool, spa, gym...etc.  I got a real good deal at $59.99 (weekday) \/w the restaurant credit, and two drinks at one of the bars.  If you can find the same deal go for it.  I wouldn't pay anything over $150 for a room here on a weekday.",3,0,2

When reserving, ask for a room near the elevator as you have to walk down long ass halls. The west wing is ideally located that if you get off the elevator there is a bar there and the sportsbook outside. If you wanna go to the pool, go to the restaurants, or the Ka show, just walk down the hallway and it cuts you into those areas. The monorail also stops at this casino. You don't have to walk through one or two casinos to get to it.

Another plus is the pools are outstanding. You could literally kick it there the whole day, good cuz it keeps you off the tables!  They have great shows and great restaurants (see my other reviews).  One stop shopping baby! You never have to leave the hotel.",0,0,0

It's decor is standard, no jaw dropping sites or anything, but I think the best part of this place is the crowd. There are a lot of people here and everyone seems pretty ready to party.

Wrong. I called and had no problem reserving a handicap accessible room with roll-in shower & bench, and was told our room would be ready by 3pm. With our deal, it was to be a king size tower suite with a strip view - and the view was important to me because it was my fiance's first trip to Vegas.

We arrived to check in a few minutes before 3, and were promptly told no handicap accessible rooms were available. Then the woman at the front desk looks at me, sitting in my wheelchair, and asks ""Do you really need one?"" Um, yeah! Unless you want me to be further injured and sue the tail off your hotel, then yeah! I kinda need to bathe safely, thanks!

So she does some checking and find ONE accessible room, but it's not ready, and she can't guarantee when it will be. So I told her we need to be in that room, clothes changed, and ready to leave the hotel by 430p for our dinner plans with friends. She offers 2 free buffets for the inconvenience, because she was going to charge for the 2 buffets we were already supposed to have free with our reservation! When I explained, she said she could give me a $50 food\/beverage comp - not really useful when our only meal at the hotel was going to be the buffet. 

Took the comp anyway - used it at a hotel bar: a beer and a white russian $22... I tipped $3 and the bartender accidentally typed it in as a $300 tip!  What if I hadn't caught that mistake?!

Went to the lion habitat. The lions are cute, the tourists are morons - several people around us kept calling them tigers and were freaking out that the guys trained to be with the lions were hanging out in the habitat with them. 

Our room - when we were finally able to get into it - was smaller than we reserved and had a crappy parking garage view. There was a stain on the blanket. The tv remote was filthy, and there weren't many channels too choose from anyway. The shower took a good 5 min to kick on some hot water, but eventually it did warm up. 

The breakfast buffet kinda sucked. A small selection compared to other breakfast buffets. But the omelet guy was really good and fun to watch.

Parking was free, and no worse than other hotels. The shops by the parking were cool, and some really good prices.

Even though checking in was stressful enough to make me cry, we still had a better experience than other friends have now told me they had at this hotel.

Never again.",2,1,0

Last time we also stayed at the MGM to see Copperfield so we have visited a few of the restaurants already. This time we ate dinner at another hotel and had to leave early so just had time for a quick coffee at Starbucks. 

The check in and check out line does tend to get long so prepare for that! Especially on your way out so you don't miss a flight! We almost did because after the long check out line there was also a long line to get a taxi. But we learned this is an uber from the parking lot so we will do that next time. 

The Starbucks was typical overpriced but just perfect for a small yet decent breakfast for the road.

The first room we were given had a door connected it to the room next door but we could clearly hear our neighbors and they weren't event talking that loudly. We called the front desk and asked to be switched and they helped us move to another room. They also brought us a new set of keys so we didn't have to wait in the long check in line again.

Horrible experience. I will never stay at the hotel again. AC was broke and all the rooms smell really bad. Our friends  room got booked and he had to stay with us, no problem. The next day our other couple arrived. SAME problem. How? The two friends didn't even know eachother they didn't book together how could this happen? 

Their room? Horrible,  construction didn't let them sleep at all. Really bad condition room and overall experience. 

The 5th room (or what would have been had they not messed up) was really really hot. A couple was staying in there and couldn't even sleep in the same bed because it was so hot. 


Lastly we stayed there 4 nights in a crowded room we got food catered to our room the first night. The Cary of food was there when we left Monday morning. Cleanliness ?!?!?  None.

We called the front desk and a maintenance ticket was placed but couldn't be completed until 11am the next day. So fast forward to then, the ticket hadn't been completed so we called to ch close status and a tech was sent up quickly, he attempted to charge the unit and changed the filter. The unit cooled down a few degrees which was good for us. We went to eat and when we returned there was a horrible chemical smell where the freon had leaked out. So we called the desk and the room was changed. We were told the new room number and that the keys were just auto switched. When we got to the new room the keys didn't work so I went to the front desk noting that the doorway didn't look like my original room at all. 

The young lady (Ashley) working the desk got my information and began looking into the matter. She politely asked if I minded waiting shortly while she went to speak with her manager. She slipped into the back and when she returned about 5 minutes later informed me problem solved, whoever I talked to hadn't completed the switch and for the inconvenience my room was being upgraded free of charge for the duration of my stay to a grand King suite which was much larger than my original comped reservation, my fees were waived as well. 

Ashley and her manager Andre demonstrate why I choose to stay at the MGM property while in Vegas. I spend a good deal of money on vacation here and the level of customer service and genuine care they provide are exemplary of the hospitality industry and the Vegas principle. I felt that she personally took ownership of a problem she did not create, sought and completed resolution then communicated sincerely with me as a customer and I truly felt appreciated.

+ I was there for 3 nights, from a Thursday-Sunday. I arrived 3 hours before check-in time and my room was ready! 

+ We had another friend staying with us that had booked a lower grade room (the West Wing King), that wanted to stay on my floor (in the Grand tower). Our check-in agent was SO nice, and not only upgraded her room type for her whole stay, but also got us adjoining\/connecting rooms! 

+ The room was very clean and nicely appointed. I highly recommend the Grand tower!! The beds were comfy, the shades are automatic and have different options (blackout was perf for sleeping!) and sheer if you want to let only a little bit of light in. The showerhead was a big ""rainfall"" style. Walls seemed thick enough, as we couldn't hear anything between rooms.

+ OMG... don't even get me started on the pool & the lazy river! Definitely plan to spend a full day here. It's such a blast. We rented a daybed (highly recommended) for a $100 food and beverage minimum. You can comfortably fit 4 adults on it if they're laying down on it, but 3-4 more could fit if you make the space. 

**INSIDER TIP: You can bring OUTSIDE food & beverage into the pool! We brought down all kinds of snacks, and some drinks (but drinks have to be brought in plastic containers - no glass or cans, and a max. of 2 drinks per person).

+ Fat Tuesdays (!!!!!)
There are many places in the hotel that serve up frozen drinks, but Fat Tuesdays is the best. Most of their drinks have a rum base, and you can add an extra test-tube shot in your drink for only $1! These drinks were perfectly blended and tasted great. We went to the other frozen drink place close to the pool area, and my drink tasted watery and chunks of it would get stuck in my straw. This didn't happen at FTs. I recommend blending the Electric Lemonade and the Strawberry flavors :)

+ The salon\/spa was fantastic. My bestie was getting married and they did her hair, airbrush makeup, and nails, and it all came out fabulous. The airbrush makeup really did have an airbrush effect - it looked flawless! The only thing I didn't care for was the prices! She paid a LOT of money to get all that done! But well worth the splurge for a special occasion!

+ Whiskey Downs was an awesome, chill lounge\/bar. I went there around 1-3am after Hakkasan and dug the drinks (they have a delicious one called Walk on the Wild Side that has rock candy syrup, whiskey, lemon, and ginger beer, with raspberries)

+ Hakkasan was O-K. It was one of my few disappointments. The club itself has ridiculous energy and great music, but they crammed way too many people in there for Tiesto. I had no personal space at all on the dance floor - we were all sandwiched in there and people were spilling drinks and pushing into us all night. I could only take so much of it. XS is a much better nightclub experience if you don't have a VIP area.

+ I didn't eat in any of the restaurants on this particular visit, but I have been to Pearl and Fiamma Trattoria a few years ago and both were excellent.",3,0,0

 this trip most of the staff have been great as usual
 
but the state of my queen executive suite is so bad after talking to ""duty manager""Johnson"" who ended up not being his real name as no one worked there by that name 

I was advised that rooms are only given  a ""deep Clean "" every ""few"" days this room hasn't had one for a while I would think of the ""things"" that go on in Vegas hotel rooms I would expect a full clean for each new guest 

 if u look at pics 
The Air vent hasn't been cleaned for years 
behind the toilet is yellow and filthy 
food scraps under the lounge
dirty valance 
 floors not vacuumed  
mould in shower 
marks On mirrors 
blinds don't work did get fixed after 2nd day 
TV didn't work twice had to call
To get friendly tech guy to fix but he never showed after 8hours so we called again he arrived after midnight 
Sheets on one of the bed had a rip in it 

We tried to speak with the same duty manager but he gave a fake name and did not have a name tag on that was around 11pm on the 4th 

We then spoke to Nate guest relations he advised he would send house keeping to ""deep clean"" the room they never showed poor follow up from him 

My travelling partner also left some expensive rings on the dresser when we went to play slots when she remembered we returned to the room and could not find them after searching all of the room I found them under the bedside table right up the back don't know how they ended up there 

we had also found a Diamond earring that we were planning to hand in but that was taken from the dresser 

As for the cocktail waitress's lisa was great on the  floor she is always great and remembers me from all My other visits even our drinks. 

We booked a day bed at the pool and felt that the service was friendly food and drinks nice and the price is worth it when u take into account the food and drinks count towards the cost  but felt they were short staffed as on girl was handling all the day beds and cabanas.  

After having no success with calling managers We then went to the mlife manager Angela who requested a copy of all my pics and responded promptly and professionally getting the guest services manager to call 

The call from Charelle   The service manager  she was very  helpful advising rooms are cleaned not every few days she was
Sending my pics to the house keeping manager and she gave great comps including nice food and beverage allowance  and she apologised continually 

 I was totally satisfied with the outcome from the conversation with her and hope my next visit will have seen some cleaning improvement.",7,1,2

When we got there, they sent us to our room, which was a ""modern updated"" version, complete with 'open sink area' and glass doors to both shower AND a separate glass door for the toilet.  Immediately we said no!   We called down to the front desk and asked for another room.  Of course it cost us $20 more a night (they have to gig you every chance they get).  

We moved up one floor and toward the front of the hotel.  The room was more to our taste.  However, the air conditioner had trouble keeping up.  We had to set it on 65 degrees and kept it there all 4 days.  It stayed moderately cool, but never got to ice cold. The tub had issues draining at times, which indicates to me that the hotel is getting old and the plumbing is not up to par.

Of course there is the $25 a night charge for ""resort fee"".  Rapists......

The workout room on the 4th floor consisted of a few treadmills, elliptical gliders, and some other funky machine.  No free weights or machine weights or even a pull up bar.

The hotel had a certain smell every time we entered from the outside.  No matter which door we came in, it always smelled like they were trying to cover up a musty smell or something.  We went into a lot of hotels on the Strip and none of them came close to smelling like this.

This hotel is at the south end of the strip, which makes for longer walks to things. Bottom line is we will not ever be staying here again; first and last for both of us.  I guess we can say that we had sex at the MGM without ever having to take our clothes off !!

The view was really nice, but the green lighting was pretty annoying when looking outside at night.  Like someone else said, the bathrooms don't have vents, so having to wipe the mirrors down was a pain.  

The first night we stayed in a smoking room which didn't smell like smoke at all....the next 2 days we moved to non-smoking rooms so that we would be next door to the rest of our friends....and those rooms smelled more like smoke than the non-smoking!  I didn't mind, but it was kinda funny.  

Bathroom is a decent size....the full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice, but they don't have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroom.....which was weird....

Oh, and I think the only restaurant in the MGM opened 24 hrs. is Studio Cafe.  It's a little pricey but it's good and they serve HUGE portions.

This place lives up to the Travel Channel legacy as being larger than life! I was still confused where things were after three days. As soon as you walk into the hotel, you are greeted by a massive lobby complete with several massive TV screens with the ongoings of the hotel and casino. The employees that work here are very professional and try to carter to everyone's needs. We were able to pull off early check-in and also a slight upgrade to the Sky Lofts. 

After checking in, we were able to explore the bells and whistles that is the casino floor. The casino floor is above and beyond huge. They have one of the largest assortments of slot machines, along with my favorite past times, roulette and craps! 

The room at the Sky Lofts were a bit of a walk compared to the main rooms in the hotel, but they had a much modern and streamlined look. The Sky Loft seemed to be more intimate and futuristic at the same time, complete with a built in TV in the bathroom mirror. Also the travel sized shampoo, conditioner and body wash that came with the hotel did not smell like crap and was not of inferior quality-most girls would appreciate this! 

The hotel also houses a plethora of restaurants, both inexpensive and expensive which we dined at both. We were able to try Stag Deli, Fat Tuesday's, Shibuya, and Mama Iladro's Pizza. All ranged from good to fantastic. 

The same night we arrived in Vegas, we had tickets to see KA which was amazing! (It is a must see, but that's another review.) It was so convenient to have the show at the same place in which we were staying in. It saved us a $10-14 cab ride! 

The pool area is also a must visit, especially during the desert's summer months. Remember to have your room key in tote, because you will be asked for it to enter the pool area. The pool area included several pools, a lazy river, an endless supply of lounge chairs, about 3 pool bars staggered around and last but not least WET REPUBLIC!!! 

I would not even hesitate to look for another destination hotel and casino, because this place is it! Although a little at the far end of the strip, it is a ""one stop shop"" to everything fun in Vegas! 

F.Y.I: Text ""VIP"" to 50435 for special offers and promotions! (Example: Say you get a text that states buy one cocktail, get one cocktail free. All you have to do is show your cellphone with the text to the bartender and they will honor it! How awesome is that!?)",3,0,3

Annoyingly, MGM Grand charges for parking even for patrons of one of their restaurants. I avoided this by parking for free up the Strip a ways at Planet Hollywood. They should really validate parking for restaurant customers - I won't pay their $10 rate and would avoid coming here if there was no way around it. There are many good restaurants in Vegas and on the Strip, so I have other choices. The food at Fiamma's is good, but this policy is ridiculous. 

As for the casino resort, it's OK, similar to other casinos on the Strip. Specifically, similar to casinos without a parking fee (Wynn, TI, etc). As such, I won't be a patron here until they get rid of the parking fee. I used to like their poker room, but it is no better than the one at Encore.",4,0,1

When my husband wanted to play a little before the Yelp event I was skeptical. He took out enough to at least last you an hour on slots but he only lasted like 20 min at the most. We usually will play on one machine together but I already knew what was going to happen so I chose to play with my phone instead while he played slots.

On this trip, we arrived on a Sunday and had a very short wait to check in.  The ""Grand"" rooms are good size still in good shape following a 2012 renovation.  The MGM is upper-middle of the road price-wise for the strip, but you can usually get a  deal on rooms through the Mlife program.  MGM features several types of rooms and suites and the suites are a reasonable upcharge from regular rooms compared to many other strip properties.  You can check out via kiosks in the lobby and get a statement e-mailed, which makes the check-out process much simpler and quicker.

The property has a slew of restaurants, many with associated celebrity chef names.  On this trip, they were advertising happy hours in many of the restaurants, so we took advantage of Emeril's for an early evening drink and appetizer.  We have eaten at several of these places in the past, and all are pretty good.  

The pool is outstanding.  It is huge, with a party pool, adult (not topless) pool, a river pool and 2 other pools.  There are always plenty of lounge chairs and waitresses running drinks.

Like the pool, the casino is huge.  Table minimums seldom fall below $15 for blackjack, but there are always plenty of tables from which to choose.  

Overall, MGM Grand is a good property.  It is located in a prime portion of the strip, has good food and drink, along with nice rooms.  There is a monorail station in the hotel for easy access to other strip properties.  The staff is friendly and as attentive as they can be in such a large hotel.  My only caution is to be prepared for some walking.  Like any of the major hotels on the strip, it is quite a hike to get from your room to the street.

There weren't Internet & TV for our entire stay (June 19, 2013). They said they would fix it; they didn't. Also, I had been emailed an option to upgrade my room to a suite. They said ""[I] have been selected"" for this upgrade. We didn't receive it.

We tried to redeem MyVegas comps for a restaurant called Delights, and they don't know what to do. Note: MyVegas has been in existence since last year. First, we went to the Mlife desk at the main MGM hotel. We were told that in order to redeem the rewards, we have to go to the Signature @ MGM Grand because it's a ""different"" hotel. I double checked and asked two people at the Mlife desk before we left. We went to the Signature @ MGM Grand and asked the front desk if we can redeem the rewards there. They told us to bring it to Delights - the restaurant - directly. We went to the restaurant and they told us they need a comp slip with a code. The restaurant mentioned there had been people who were also given the run around. As the walk from the Signature @ MGM Grand to the main MGM Grand hotel is far, we went back to the Signature @ MGM Grand's front desk and asked for help. They told us we have to go all the way back to the Mlife desk at the main MGM Grand hotel. We didn't redeem the rewards.

So the lock components are only the electronic card reader which wasn't very satisfying but they didn't even come up or call me back. However I will say the thing that I loved loved loved about the MGM was the bathroom in the room everything was top notch and the shower was the best I've had in Vegas. So if I had to break down my rating I would give the bathroom a four or five star rating and the rest of the hotel service fees and everything else a one or a two star.

Back in 2010 I was expanding my business to the Vegas area and dating someone who lived in Vegas. I damn near lived at the MGM Grand (My hostess actually calls it my home hotel). In total I've stayed here roughly 35 times. 

Let's start with location - Right on the strip in Vegas. It's a little on the South end of the strip so if you like strolling the strip it will e quite a walk to Caesar's and the Mall. However, the tram that runs up and down the strip has a stop inside the MGM. USE THE TRAM IN THE SUMMER! Don't kill yourself trying to walk the strip. 

Rooms - Rooms were recently upgraded. Very nicely, in fact. It's been awhile since I've stayed in a standard room so I have no idea what they are like. But if you can, find a deal online and get a suite or room with a jacuzzi. I promise it will be worth it. Sign up for the e-mail list... GREAT DEALS!

Staff?Service - It's Vegas and it the MGM Grand, so of course service is first class. Anytime you need anything someone is there to help you with a smile. Waiters especially are super friendly. If you sign up for their VIP club ""Prima"" there are some great benefits like upgrades, express check in\/out, limo from airport or around town. Prima's great if you go to Vegas at least 4 times a year. Otherwise, it might not be worth it. 

Casino - I don't gamble much and I hate smoke (this is a downside of Las Vegas), so I don't spend much time on the casino floor. Like every casino hotel it's a bit of a maze, but that intentional to keep people on the floor. It won't be better anywhere else. I do play a bit of high stakes poker. My hostess is always good about getting me into private games and making sure. I love her for that. 

Clubs - Tabu is the hot spot here, but I don't feel go for it often. What I do love is the pool club - Wet Republic. So much fun! It's a day club, so being your sunscreen. 

Restaurants - Never a bad meal. In fact,some of the best meals of my life. I will review the restaurants separately. 

Overall I love the MGM Grand. It's that perfect blend of old and new for me. Not so classic or old school as the Bellagio, but not so yuppie\/euro riche as the Wynn. Plus, if you like Boxing or UFC\/MMA all the best bouts are that the arena in the MGM.",2,1,1

I felt sorry for the employees- they have to breathe this all week long and I can't believe it doesn't impact their health. (I don't know why it is legal to smoke indoors in Las Vegas.)

But she failed to tell us about this ""no show"" room fee which I think every guest should know about. 

Their customer service and their billing department is awful they are the worst to deal with. I've never had to deal with a hotel like this in my life and this is an understatement. WE NEVER GOT OUR DEPOSIT BACK.

My husband wrote a review as well and on how bad their customer service really is. When he wrote his review, their response is please email our billing department to resolve this issue. Did we get it resolve? No we did not.
 
I would not stay here I would not recommend anybody staying here. On their website it states that there are no hidden fees but there are hidden fees.

Request for a room change due to lack of Internet was declined by Guest (dis)-services as they had no other rooms - please note, I was not playing the upgrade game, just requesting another room as I needed to work. 
Eventually I spoke to someone who was allegedly the Manager on Duty and he also claimed that there were no other rooms, offered me the option of changing rooms the next day and, offered me a courtesy Internet voucher for the business centre; (they didn't offer to bring this to the room)  for this I had to go down and wait with all the people checking into the non-existent other rooms before being told by the front desk that I should come back in the morning;  at which point I demurred and they finally gave me a voucher
.
The next day, about an hour before my a critical meeting, I went down to the business centre and worked with the staff for a while before they agreed that the wireless down there wasn't that good as they were changing providers. They were very sweet and clearly stressed due to workload but I cannot fault their attempts to get me online, the business centre lady was even willing to put the charge on her company card (which at a dollar a mnute for internet was brave) but she didn't know when it would expire and was concerned that it might die during my meeting.
Brave try by the business center but,I ended up cancelling my meeting and i was not that happy about it. Note that so far, I have been in the hotel about 13 hours with this lack of service..

I have never had a hotel refuse to allow a room change and LIE to me as well. 
I was only staying one other night otherwise I would have just checked in somewhere else. 

I understand that Vegas makes their money on the drunks and gamblers but some of us need to work., just let us know that you don't have the facilities so that we can go elsewhere. 

In other news, we went to the buffet, - VERY mediocre, just no and pass it by, I didn't find it worth the time or money. 
On the upside, the room was nice although the guy vacuuming at 9:30 in the morning was a little irritating with the noise. The room doors are not really soundproofed that well, which in Vegas should be some sort if hanging offense. If you stay here, make sure you are a spud sleeper or stay out until nobody else will be coming past the room ( of course then the chap vacuuming will wake you) oh, bring your own Internet hot spot, you'll be charged a resort fee of 25 USD a night for the free USA today and access to the fitness centre and the patchy Internet.

In the spirti of fair play I would say that if the staff at guest services hadn't outright lied to me then the property could have got 2 stars, maybe pushing to 3 but that completely turned me of so they get the infamous 1.

For example, tickets to cirque are expensive (worth it, but costly). There are several sites that offer some discounts. It ends us that a small link on the Cirque site offers the most straightforward discount. Then I realized that we could have gotten free tickets with our room if we would have booked through the hotel. The discount websites were in the same ballpark as the free ticket rate from MGM. So, do some homework if there is specific things you want to do. 

When you purchase your room through a discount site you are most likely buying a room in the west wing of this property which is a very far walk from the front door. My wife and I are very quick walkers and it took us probably 12 minutes from front door to our hotel room door. That was frustrating and we didn't realize it until we were there. 

Discount sites also did not make it clear that we would have to pay a $20.00 per day resort fee in addition to the prepaid amount. The hotel tried to tell us that WiFi costs $15.00 per day and there were some other crap amenities that we were supposed to be thankful for in exchange for the $20.00 per day. Its a profit center for them and I'm starting to realize that vegas is full on nickel and diming you for everything now. 

All of the other strip hotels advertised that they didn't charge the $20.00 resort fee so maybe MGM is the only one doing that. 

The room was fine, although the only shower\/toilet separation was a frosted glass wall. Fine for the shower, but the toilet was a little awkward especially if you have to make a special deposit if you know what I mean. I don't want anyone in the room with me have to suffer that. 

The hallways were somewhat dirty. I'm not sure if that was on the ""west wing"" cheap rooms residents or the cleaning crew was a little lax. Either way, it was not ""clean"". Our room was clean and that's my main priority. 

This hotel has a nice selection of restaurants including the best sushi on the strip and the finest dining at Joel Rebuchon ($495 per person for a 16 course pre fixe). They also have quite a few lower cost options for eating. 

Plenty of gambling and Cirque's ""KA"" show is there. Other stuff is there, but this trip centered around a friends wedding, so we spent more time with them that doing other stuff. 

Notable mention for Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill. The food although a bit on the high side of price is very good.

Another plus at MGM is the Valet parking...best on the strip for drop off and pick up ofyour car. No other place was as efficient and friendly. Don't be cheap, tip a buck or two when they retrieve your car. More if you have a bunch of people or crap to load.",1,1,1

The room itself was nice, clean, bed was comfy, hot water in the shower at night, ran out of hot water one morning, there was good pressure.  No refrigerator in the room, so that was kind of a bummer. Also, the bed pillows are feather.  All of them.  No extra non feather pillows in the closet like other hotels and I really didn't feel like trying to track down someone to get me some.  I want everything in my room and not have to work for it.

Walls are paper thin we could hear our neighbors cell phone going off during the wee hours of the morning, and it took them awhile to answer, same thing with the alarm clock the next morning at 6:30 am.  seriously  needs better walls, and while we're at it insulated windows.  We had the unfortunate luck of staying in the part of the hotel facing the airport, hearing airplanes all night and even a siren and motorcycle or 2 even though we were on the 26th floor.

Also, the hotel is not well organized and there aren't many food options as far as something small and quick or a little something to hold you over until dinner.  Food court had a Nathan's Hot dog and McDonald's.  Another random hallway on the way to the parking garage had a cookie\/bakery place where everything looked icky and coffee wasn't that great.  The sandwich we got at the Stage Deli was good, but the menu options were limited.

Also,There is a nice advertisement for the spa, but no prices, and the spa closes at 8.  We walked all the way to the other end of the property, to find they were closed, gated off, and no price list anywhere.  Walked all the way back to the concierge desk, oops they close up at 9.  Seriously?  The concierge had even left us a message saying if we needed anything, contact them.  No such luck.  Asked the employee who stands in the lobby and directs you to check in if they knew the prices, nope.   ARGH!  Very frustrating!  I saved some loot, but seriously MGM you lost out.

Signs around the property are confusing, I know its probably on purpose to keep you wandering around the casino, but seriously, pissing me off while I'm trying to find something isn't going to make me want to plop down at a table and start gambling.",2,0,0

We stayed in the 775 SF 1bed suite and when we checked in early morning, we requested a strip view close to an elevator with a pack n play for a baby.  We ended up getting an airport view at the end of the longest hotel hallway I've ever seen and no pack n play.  The hallway must have been several hundred feet long.  I called to see if we could switch rooms and was hold for 20 mins just to find out there was nothing they could do.  I guess all the 1bed tower suites are at the end of hallways so I won't fault them for that.  The entire stay we had a mysterious sewer smell coming out of the bathroom which the engineer said was coming from other rooms above us.  Our 3rd day included no running water and the lights would periodically not work.  We also had an automatic shade that didn't work and needed to be repaired.  All these incidents happened individually and each time I called was 10-20 minutes I'll never get back.  For all the trouble and wasted time, they were only able to comp 2 nights resort fees and a late check out.  Pretty pathetic.  Warning to those who are interested in the 1bed tower suite, they are all at the end of extremely long hallways and the living room area is very dark.  There are only 2 side lamps for the room.

Rooms: (3 stars) the rooms overall were small but modern and did the job just fine. We didn't have a good view but we were in the west tower and only on the 5th floor. I didn't like the bathrooms because there is only a door to the toilet so privacy is minimal. Also there was barely any counter space in the bathroom making getting ready a challenge. I thought the bed was comfy but others thought it was hard. All in all the room was fine. 

Issues: I called a week ahead to get all three rooms close to each other or even on the same floor, they said it wouldn't be a problem so I was a little frustrated when they couldn't accommodate this when we checked in. Also, the actual door mechanism on my parents door (what you slide your card into) broke on the first night. They had to wait outside their room at midnight for 1.5 hours for someone to come fix it. They finally came, and the next day we were comped $300 for food and drinks at MGM restaurants so they handled our problem really well and we were totally content and over the door issue. 

Casino: (4 stars) out of all of the casinos this is the one we all won the most money at! We also really liked how big it was, huge sports book, lots of tables, and slots galore. We really enjoyed the virtual craps, blackjack, and roulette: all the fun without the pressure of playing at a table. 

Staff: The staff here were awesome! Stephanie (from NY!) and Michelle were great on the roulette table and some of the best casino workers I've come across!!!

Food: There are a ton of food options in the MGM so if you're staying here don't overlook your options! They have a food court for fast, cheap, or late night eats stocked with the basics like McDonalds, Nathan's, and Pizza. They also have finer dining options like Craftsteak and Emeril's. 

MGM location: Bottom line is that the MGM is HUGE. To get from our room to the casino took at least 5 minutes. Everywhere you go in the casino it's far away so plan for comfy shoes. Also, a lot of people told us we stayed on the wrong end of the strip and I have to disagree. Yes this is farther away from the mirage and Venetian but the walk is doable (and entertaining) and the tram is easy. 

I would probably check out another hotel next time I am in Vegas but I enjoyed our stay at the MGM grand.",3,1,0

As with anything in Las Vegas, you are nickeled and dimed A LOT. An additional $25 per night if you want a mini fridge seems a tad ridiculous to me, as well as a $50 fee if you move the mini bar items around to make room for your own beverages or snacks? CRAZY. Also, $3 for a vending machine soda? Not happening. There was also a sign near the pool offering 2 complimentary inter tubes for the river pool, but in fact they are $16 an hour even to hotel guests. Requested a room with a view of the Strip, received a room with a view of the airport, the roof below, and a LOT of green hotel.
There was also not a discount to hotel guests for any shows happening inside the hotel. Yes it was free to get into the pool and the nightclub, but with the food and drink prices jacked up to what they were you are better off scoring free drink wristlets at a different hotel and paying a cover to get in. 
Construction made getting around the hotel a pain at times. 
A little far from the big events and happenings on the Strip. Towards the quieter end of the Strip. Super comfortable bed and great bathroom lighting, plus complimentary hair dryer.

I travel to Las Vegas about once a month for work, and have stayed at just about every cheap to not-so-cheap hotel on the strip. When I fly out there for fun, the MGM has always been my go-to hotel. 

The player's club card prices for this hotel just can't be beat. Where else can you stay at a 4 star hotel on the strip for about $50 - $60\/night? The hotel is huge, and other then going out to see specific shows or go to a specific club, we literally never have to leave the hotel during our trips. 

The pool is a lot of fun. I like ""wet republic"" as it is more of a place for young adults to hang out and relax with a cocktail. The regular pool areas are also fun if your with family, although the noise little kids can be a little annoying (it's fun to steal their inner-tubes and ride down the rivers though.) 

The restaurants are some of the best I have gone to. They have a cheapy food court with a few dining options, but we never eat there (why waste a Vegas trip by eating crap fast food you could get back home anyways.) CraftSteak has to be my most favorite steak house, and we always eat there at least one night every time we go to Las Vegas. They have other good options too, like Wolfgang Puck's place, Emeril's, WichCraft, and Shybua. The prices might seem a little high at first at these higher end restaurants, but once you eat the food and taste how good everything is, you will find that the prices are well worth it. 

If you are into the clubbing scene (I am) the location of this hotel is great. They have Wet Republic for the day, and have two decent clubs in the hotel that always play good music. Tabu and Studio 54 might not draw the largest crowds, but they always play good music all night long, and they always have a good mixed crowd. Best of all, you can drink and dance yourself silly and not worry about catching a cab home since you are already in the hotel you are staying at. All the other big named clubs on the strip are all a short cab ride away. 

The hotel rooms themselves are nice. Soft, comfy beds, spacious rooms and larger bathrooms, everything is very clean and well maintained. Room service is great at accommodating needing guests.

Both the manicure and pedicure chipped within 2 days and did not look professional.  The manicurist left smears of polish on the skin under my nails.  Sub par quality for more than twice the price I pay back home where the pedi lasts about 2 weeks and the mani about 1 1\/2 weeks.
Also, I was lied to and taken advantage of.  I got my appointment time mixed up and showed up about 20 minutes late at which point, I was told they could not accommodate my original appointment because they did not want to keep the client after me waiting.  So, they offered to give me an abbreviated\/express mani\/pedi which I thought was fair considering I'm the one who made the mistake.  However, I was charged the higher, original price for the full service treatment that I did not receive.  When I told them how unfair it was that I get charged for the full service I was told it's because I was late and the client after me was kept waiting.  They also said that it's unfair to the manicurist who was expecting to get paid for a full service mani\/pedi and will now have to settle for the express price.

The bathroom had nothing in it like no soap,  soap holder, kleenex box...etc. I called to have someone come clean it up. They asked if I wanted to place a report,  my family said drop it not a big deal so I did not. NEXT...... we go play in the MGM casino not the same day I ask a worker for a bottle Water for my grandpa so he can take his medication Which I even Explained, As I had been Waiting about 35-40 minutes for our server ""pam"" who was great but he needed Water ASAP. ....so this other woman told me NO, I NEED TO WAIT FOR MY SERVER VERY RUDE!  I mean it's not like I'm asking for a drink I'm asking nicely for water for my grandpa.  I did request a manager,  all the manager stated was each server has their own jurisdiction and they are very busy. I Said to the floor manager I'm in management myself and customer service is crucial, and if people like me don't report who knows how many people that server us doing that too. Very unprofessional!

The MGM Grand, is, according to the check-in-lady who assisted me, the ""second largest hotel in the world."" Not sure how true that is, but the place is incredibly ginormous. Like many hotels in Las Vegas, it is like a giant shopping mall with nice rooms for sleeping when you're all done spending all your moolah. 

In my 6 days in Sin City, I spent most of my time within the confines of this hotel - I was attending the annual NCTE conference which was held in conference area. I think I walked from my hotel room (in the Grand Tower, close to the entrance) to the conference wing 3 dozen or so times in those 6 days.....and those are LONG walks. 

The conference rooms are nice - good range of small and intimate to huge huge huge (actually, the biggest conferences were held in the ballrooms). An outside promenade led to the vendor\/convention area. I thought the set up was quite well done, and generally things were easy to find. 

My hotel room was really nice. I loved the blackout curtain option. Bed was super comfortable and I loved the bathroom. Internet was spotty at times but overall fine coverage. One thing you have to know - don't expect a mini-fridge (I did, and got quite a surprise!). The fridge in the room has a sign on the bottles that is hard to miss - basically, if you move anything around to store your own stuff, an electronic sensor automatically charges you a $50 re-stocking fee. FIFTY DOLLARS. And if you want your OWN fridge, you can request one - for a mere $35. Good grief. Needless to say, there was no complimentary coffee or tea maker in the room either. My hallway was completely full of guests, yet I never heard noise from other rooms, so kudos on the soundproof-ness. But man, I was the second to last room in my hallway and it was suuuuch a long walk to the elevator, and then of course to the conference area.

Like others have noted, there are just endless options for eating here. From the super cheap (McDonalds) to the lunch and snack crowd (Project Pi, Blizz) to the nice dinner (Craftsteak, Pearl) to the ridiculous dinner (Joel Robuchon), there is something for every palate and budget. Tip: the Starbucks in the food court always has a long line - there is another one by one of the theatres - it usually doesn't have nearly as long of a line. 

MGM Grand is a nice hotel, and while it didn't knock my socks off, I was glad to be able to experience this town for the first time from this hub.",3,0,1

compared to the other hotel casinos on the strip, it was lacking the WOW factor of vegas. yes, they have a lion habitat and a golden lion in the front and in the lobby but there was nothing else. i did appreciate the golden sun\/stars on the ceiling but it lacked the detail and pazzaz i expected.",0,0,0

Arrived on a Sunday and the lobby was insaaannee! Waited like 20 or so minutes behind ONE person checking in. After waiting we had to take this epic walk to the West Wing. Finally got to the room.. and I thought it was nice but a lil funky. Not really my style and kinda small. The bed was super comfy. The bathrooms were odd and really had no privacy.There were room service carts all over the elevator area and actually stayed there the whole day. I guess they were a little too busy to clean up? 
The air conditioning was OK. It was like 100 deg outside and I dont think the air conditioning could really keep up with the weather outside. The chairs in the room were very uncomfortable and when you took a shower there would be a puddle of water outside the shower every time. 
A good thing about the West Wing is that there is an exit straight to the strip right thru the West Wing Bar. Also its easily accesible to the New York New York walkway and the casino. 
This hotel is epic. It is so big and I got lost so many times. 
The rooms are kind of noisy and you constantly hear people down the hallways and room doors opening and closing. 
The staff was really nice and very helpful with everything. 
As for the casino it was pretty big and always seemed to be packed. Drink service absolutely SUCKS at the MGM grand. 
The monorail is connected to this hotel so that was cool.

The MGM definitely has a lot of action going on, there's always something to do at this hotel.  

CHECK-IN
Lines were constantly long and never-ending when we stayed there.  When we were checking in, we waited a good 20 minutes in line.  They have a long counter with multiple employees to check guest in but there are just so many guests that it takes them a while to get through the line.  Heidi checked us in and she was awesome, she even got us a nice room with a partial view of The Strip.    She did a good job of explaining the amenities and how to get the free Wi-Fi.     

ELEVATORS
Make sure you know exactly what tower you're staying in because they have a different set of elevators for each tower.  You have to head in the same direction for the elevators but then the paths fork off into different areas to get to your respective side of the hotel.  

ROOM 
The room we stayed in had a decent view of the strip and of the New York Hotel and Casino.  The room was pretty large and clean.  The safe was hidden in the cabinet below our flat screen TV and we also had a mini bar.  The mini bar was strictly for their drinks and there would be a fee if we stored any personal food or drinks in the fridge.  They know because there are sensors in the fridge and every time you remove an item, it keeps track and they charge you for everything that you take out.  The bathroom was pretty spacious and it came with a hairdryer.  

VALET
MGM's valet has a pretty efficient process going on.  There are tons and tons of guests who constantly come and go so they have to be quick and efficient to keep the traffic outside of the hotel in order.  They have a long driveway with multiple lanes and the very far right lane is for the taxi cabs lined up ready to pick up guests at any given time.  The lanes in the middle are where you pull up to drop your car off and the lanes to the left are where they bring your vehicle back to you.  When you're ready for them to bring your car out, you cross all of the lanes and proceed to a window where you give them your ticket and a few minutes later, they drive your car up for you.  Sometimes the wait is long because there are so many people trying to leave the hotel so they have benches for you to wait on.  

On nights that you should really not be driving AKA you're planning to drink a lot, the cabs come in handy!  You just walk out of the hotel and they have a podium to the right of the doors for you to wait for a cab.  Most times, there was no wait at all but on nights where everyone is leaving the club or leaving from the Cirque du Soleil show, you'll be waiting a while.  

GENERAL
The MGM Grand is HUGE and there are tons to do!  When you first walk in, you're in the lobby.  The check in\/out counters are to your right along with the concierge.  To your left is the gift shop and if you go straight, you're on the casino floor then you start hitting the restaurants and bars.  There are convenient signs hanging from the ceiling to point you in the right direction.  

They have a food court area, some upscale stores, restaurants, theaters, sports book, a gym, spa, pools, a club, you name it, and they've got it!  Their pools are my favorite in Las Vegas.  Yes, pools as in multiple pools (check out my review for the Grand Pool Complex).  Their restaurant\/buffet isn't bad either.  It's huge and can serve many people-I also have a separate review for the Grand Buffet.  I also have a review for Hakkasan, the night club on the first floor of the hotel.

The customer service for the hotel alone (not the vendors in the hotel) was pretty awesome.  I can't recall a bad experience from any of the employees.  They were on point from check-in, to valet, room service and check-out.    

This is also going to sound strange but the MGM, in my opinion is the hotel with the best scent!  Every time we walked back into the hotel, we noticed the same light, vanilla scent and I asked some of the employees what it was and they said each hotel has their own scent that comes through the A\/C vents.  It smells pretty awesome, not too overpowering but really nice and comforting.  

CHECK-OUT
The check out process was pretty quick and easy.  You can check out multiple ways and since I wasn't willing to wait in those long lines when we were leaving, I called the operator and they checked me out over the phone and e-mailed my receipt. 

I highly recommend staying at the MGM if you're looking for a lot to do and if you want to be around tons of people who want to have fun.  I am already planning my next visit to Las Vegas and the MGM Grand is at the top of my list on where to stay when I return.",10,3,9

The hotel was booked for the weekend, and I arrived late the night before the conference, so only smoking rooms were available. The smoking room was disgusting and since you can't open windows in Vegas, there was nothing I could do but suffer through the night. I felt awful the next morning. 

However, I went and checked the next morning, and they had a non-smoking room available, so I was able to switch that day. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I didn't spend much time in the room, so that's really all I needed. The internet access was reliable and though we did lose water for about 5 hours one day due to the ongoing renovation, we were notified in a timely manner, so it wasn't an issue. 

The casino floor was great. As a newbie, I didn't feel too intimidated walking around, and the waitresses were quick to take care of us.

There were tons of dining options (reviewed separately), access to the Monorail and plenty to do.

The conference space was a bit of a pain. It's not really set up for that many attendees (one escalator up and one down for 7000 people with no regular stair options is a bit ridiculous), but the sound and presentation devices were fine.

The news reported that visitors to Las Vegas is at an all time low. I figured I take advantage of this fact because I don't like large crowds. My girlfriend researched promo codes online and found us a rate for the hotel of around $69.00 a night. That also came with a meal credit and two cocktails at a bar. The rate was really good for what we got. I give this 3 stars because this rate is the exception and not the norm. If I was able to always get this price, I would have given the hotel 4 or even 5 stars for the value but I'm rating this on the average rate of $120+ dollars a night. The room was very average. A very long distance to the room from the elevator and it took forever to go up or down 27 stories. We wanted a refrigerator and asked for one. They said they would charge extra for the convenience. I also asked for a complimentary inter tube for the lazy river pool. I couldn't see spending $16.00 X2 for a freaking tube I'd use for 20 mins. They refused to budge on the price of the fridge or the  tube. I also asked for free room internet connection. Another NO. Now... when visitors to Las Vegas are at an all time low, why not give up a few things that won't cost the hotel anything just to make the customer happy. I know I being picky but when I go to Vegas, I often ask for comps and I usually get them. This hotel was tight fisted with everything. 

Dinner at Wolfgang Pucks was great. The service was nice and the meal credit worked at the location. The martinis in the West Wing Bar was excellent as well. We had a credit for two free drinks at the bar because of the room promotion. When we went to the bar, they were  having a two for one promotion. So, we ordered two drinks (free because of the room promotion) and then asked for two more because of the bar promotion, that was another NO even though we just wanted water. 

Table service in the casino was awful. I sat at the blackjack table for a long time before we could get any drinks. Tight fisted Casino\/Hotel. We walked across to the Hooters Hotel\/Casino and got drinks easily and had fun with friendly dealers. I lost my money having fun at Hooters and not at the tight fisted MGM. PS... don't knock Hooters unless you've been there. 

I'm not suggesting you avoid the MGM Grand, I'm just suggesting you get a great deal before deciding to stay there because they ain't going to give you anything above average.",0,0,0

Most of bad reviews are about West wing which hotel offers discounted prices for. I did not book a room in that area but I did pass though it on my way to Grand Canyon tour and from what I've seen and reviews I read I can tell you this: if you don't care what room you stay in as long as you have a place to stay, you don't have kids traveling with you, don't mind smoke (both cigarettes and recreational drugs) in your room, not claustrophobic (rooms are small with dark windows) then West wing will not bother you. 
Since we came late on Thanksgiving night there was almost no line for us at check in. We booked a room at Grand tower and our service desk employee gave us great room on 22nd floor with nice view (we did not tip). This area in non smoking with great clean hallways. Pretty quiet as well.

Floor of slots is kept clean and has a lot of variety, but I played and was in the area for over three hours and was never approached by employees or offered a drink. Found that very odd.

It's a good thing and a bad thing really.  I often feel overwhelmed when walking through the casino area because of the massive real estate that you have to cover to get from one place to the next.  The bar\/lounge near the front is a great place to chill though.  The rooms are decent.  The newer rooms in the West wing are very fashionable but if you are in one of the outer rooms it will feel like you are walking down a neverending hallway.  The tables here are a bit on the higher priced side as well.  If you are looking to throw some cash but not go super crazy while having lots of gambling options then this is a good place to go.,1,0,0

I stayed in the Grand Tower for five days for a conference.  By the fifth day, I just started to figure out where everything was.  Staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help in any way.  There are a tremendous number of restaurants - upscale, casual, and everything in between - and shopping available inside.  Do be aware that the main lobby does not front on the Strip so it is a long walk through the casino to get to the Strip.

Rooms were comfortable and well stocked.  I particularly liked the electric blackout curtains to help me after a few long nights.

The MGM Grand is not the best hotel I have ever stayed at, but it is very good at what it does.  If I come back to Vegas, I would certainly stay here again, but I will be willing to check rates at other properties on the Strip and check to see if I can get a better deal somewhere else.  

Special tip - go to the Starbucks at the west lobby in the morning.  The lines are much shorter than the lines at the other two Starbucks (yes - there are three Starbucks.  I told ya this place is huge)",5,0,0

We were also given resort credit for food and drinks, so who can say no ? 

Twice we stayed in identical spa suites ( only difference was the floor we were on) 

The suite was spacious. The living room and bedroom was more of an open concept studio style rather then separate bedroom. It was divided by a desk and TV. 

I liked the accent colors used and the art work. Purple ( one of my favorite colors ) it made for some great backdrops for photos. 

The living room had a large sectional and was decorated with a big huge lamp that looked like an old school movie set light.  It also had a mini bar with the usual drinks and snacks. 

The bed was a comfy King size. I think the bed was used less for sleep then it was for other fun activities ( I'm a newlywed what can I say !! ) 

There was large windows that stretched across the room facing the airport. 

The bathroom was the best. It was huge and brightly lit.  It had a long vanity with double sinks, a decent sized shower. 

The toiletries did leave a bit to be desired. 
They weren't exactly high end and didn't have conditioner or shower gel. 
Luckily I had my own, but I like to save ones from hotels, for donating to shelters when I'm home. 

The Jacuzzi was the best part, however It was high up on a platform which made it hard to get in and out of. I wish they had a small ladder as it would of come in really handy. Be careful! 

It also wasn't very big or deep. We had 3 people in it and it was a really tight squeeze ! Even for 2 people was still kinda small. However it still was fun : ) 

I liked the elevators that lead to the Grand Tower. They have a nice big waterfall in the middle. 

In the casino we loved the ""Deal or No Deal"" game ( located in front of the VIP lounge ) play it if you get a chance ! It lasts much longer then most slot machine games when you hit the bonus and tends to pay out more often then not. 

The ""Walking Dead"" game was also good due to my husband winning large on it. I myself get bored rather quick on slots, and would rather spend money on shopping (often with funds from his slot winnings - but that's another story ! ) 


The VIP lounge is behind a set of gold doors. Located in the casino to the left of the main front check in. It's behind the first few slot machines. You will see the large doors and the VIP plaque. 

 If your privileged enough to be granted access ( you must show your VIP key upon entry ) snooty attendants will serve you a glass of champagne upon request. They also have a few light snacks available, and the usual non alcoholic beverages. 

You may also use this area to lounge around and read magazines, as well you can check-in here. 

The casino has a large number of places to eat, and the staff were all great. (special thanks to Justin from StayWell he was amazing !! ) 

We went when it was quiet ( late Nov ) we went when it was slamming packed ( during the Rodeo ) and again when it was quiet ( mid Dec ) and I much preferred the times when it was not busy. 

It's not as cushy as say the Aria or The Venetian \/ Palazzo but it's way better then the Luxor ! 

I'm not sure if I would stay here normally, However if it was comped again....",4,1,3

I called the desk and was told I would just have to wait for housekeeping to clean it due to the hotel was 'booked up'. I didn't like that answer but figured I had no choice. Waited for 45 min or so and not one person came to clean up the nasty mess. I found a maid in the hall, asked her to come to my room to see if she could help me with a problem. I showed her the stains & she told me she knew of the stains but thought someone else had cleaned it up. I asked her why could the hotel rent the room knowing it was not ready and was gross. She did not answer, left and I did not see her again. I waited a little longer whereas my employer called the desk. I was then moved from the 10th floor to the 20th floor which is a smoking floor. I don't smoke nor do I tolerate it well. But...i figured if there were not gross bloody looking stains on the bedding... i was better off.

Honestly, the best thing this place has going is the Garden Arena, which still sounds excellent and the all inclusiveness that might appeal to families wanting a day or two away.

For me, it just wasn't it. They noted construction going on, but I didn't know how annoying and bad it got until they actually started doing it. Banging, cold water... It was too much. I called and asked for just a late check out so I can sleep a little and they couldn't do it. I should mention that it was on a Monday and the place was FAR from busy. 

I didn't mind the resort fees. I valeted and used the internet, so it seemed worth it. Though including the cardio room and not the gym seemed rather odd. 

Now here comes the kicker, after 4 days, I just wanted some nice employee to help me with my bags, instead I got some lousy guy who was pissy that he had to load my bags. He literally threw them into my car. Thank goodness nothing broke, but did he have to be an ass about it? It's his job. He put the cooler I had in the front seat. NOT on the floor. Did he magically think it was going to be seat belted? It's a cooler! Not a person! I even tipped him BEFORE this. I should have done it after and throw pennies at his pressed ass.

My friends checked in ahead of me because my flight was fairly late.  I managed to get from the plane to a Lyft to the Grand in relatively short order.  It can be overwhelming for a first time Vegas goer, though.  SO MANY LIGHTS AND SOUNDS.  The main lobby is appropriately impressive and it just goes on from there.  The actual layout is very sprawling but I found I was able to get around with a minimum of backtracks.  I'm not sure I was always going the quickest way, but it never seemed hard to find places in the hotel.

The room itself was pretty small, as expected.  It was clean however, and remained that way for our trip, despite our best efforts to the contrary.  Maid staff were never seen by us, since we were always out the door before they came around, but we never had cause to complain about the service.  They provide a hotel safe, which I highly recommend you use, as part of the room.  Don't make your password 1-2-3-4-5.  

There are plenty of restaurants, nightclubs, etc. to enjoy here.  I really can't recommend or even remember any of the food I had here that clearly, but I do remember the price not being commensurate with the value, to say the least.  If you're staying here, try to eat elsewhere.  I stuck to Starbucks for my morning yogurt and that served me pretty well.  The weekday mornings have a pretty strong contingent of convention goers, so there will be a line in many of the food court areas.  

For our last night, my roommates and I decided to upgrade to a suite.  This is where the ratings dive, but then recover.  We had reserved this upgrade on Wednesday.  When Saturday came, there was a 'hiccup' with the reservation.  My one roommate went down around noon the day of and was told they had no suites for the night, despite us reserving and paying in advance.  Fair enough, we headed out for the day and returned around 6.  At that point, I went down with the same roommate and went to talk to the concierge.  Realizing that the Grand is a huge business and we are a very small part, I was just gearing up to do my best 'incensed customer' routine to provoke some management response, but this proved unnecessary.  They did some shuffling and gave us a suite and some money off for the inconvenience, which I appreciated.  The suite itself was well worth it and the difference between it and an ordinary room is leaps and bounds.  Even the soaps are better.  I highly recommend splurging for at least one night.

Overall, this is a great place to have as a base of operations.  There are some basic victuals to keep you from dying, and it's a stone's throw from many of the popular strip locations.  However, try not to eat too much here, there is much more around the area that gives a better value.  Also, don't give up if you get denied a request at first, switching personnel or shifts may yield you better results.",0,1,0

The hotel itself was very clean and there was more than enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests. Our room, I believe, was in the newer section; the room itself was a very modern design and very clean. I have one complaint, the hour we had to wait just to check in. The check in desk was huge and the line was moving, there are just that many people in this place. The monorail does come to this hotel, which is convenient, just keep in mind you will have to walk a bit to get to it. The hotel itself needs a monorail. A little too big for my taste but I would probably stay again if the price were right. If you have no issues getting a little exercise just to get to the front door, or getting lost in a maze of unlimited slot machines you will probably love this place.

The glitz and glam was over the top and it was quite fascinating to see all the people dressed to the nines to go and see a couple of guys beat the crap out of each other.

Unfortunately that was the only memorable thing about MGM.  This place is a staple of the strip and at one point and used to be the place to go.  Now with the many upscale casinos that have popped up along the strip, MGM has become somewhat archaic.

To MGM's credit, they tried to remain relevant by changing their business model in the early to mid 90's by becoming ""family friendly"" and building an amusement park.  Unfortunately for them that model didn't work because Vegas isn't a kids town.  That is evident by all those street vendors handing out the escort pamphlets as you walk up and down the streets.

From the outside, MGM is still gorgeous.  There is something royal about that greenly lit building without the tackiness of many Vegas establishments.  The inside however could use a face lift as many of us could with age.  It seems as though they are continuously working on the entrance at the corner of Trop \/ LV Blvd and I would suggest they take some of that budget and move it inwards.

Table prices are high as you'd expect but you can go across the street to one of the lessor known casinos and find more reasonable tables.

When you hear the word Vegas - the MGM Grand is what comes to mind as a hotel. Vegas, The strip - MGM Grand. At least in my world it did. I've been here before - I guess a decade ago because things sure have changed. I was so surprised at the rooms! I stayed on the 17th floor in the newely so called  remodeled grand king suite. Nothing Grand about this king suite! No plush soft towels, no his and hers bath robes, no microwave, and yes they have a frig oh my bad - they're so called mini bar. Quick story: So on top of the frig they tell you to call house keeping so that you can get the frig open and put your stuff in- you would think! Hell NO - housekeeping is not coming up to open the frig for you to put your stuff in - but they'll loan you a small frig for $24.00 a night for your stuff. FUCK YOU... really??? You're the MGM GRRANNNDDDD! You can't give your paying customers a freakin frig for their drinks, food, etc. Oh I'm sorry I'm suppose to go and use the ice machine to keep my shit cold. FUCK YOU! Other hotels - have a mini bar but allow you to use the same frig. Just know when you eat or drink something - you'll have to pay. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The room was small. The pictures on the website kind of fool you which is why I go here on yelp to see THE REAL PHOTOS. The room sucked so much I didn't even really bother to take photos. It was a plane jane room Nothing fancy unless you like your room to glow like in ghost hunters. The walls are thin as hell. You can hear people outside the hallway and in their rooms. And the TV Channels suck. They list a show is on - when you turn to that channel something totally different is on. If you plan on being in your room some of the time - bring a portable cd player. Why pay $9.99 for old movie they feature??? The internet sucks - its a hit or miss. Just all together this place sucked. I really expected more. One good thing about this place I will say is - the bed is good and in order to pass up the long ass lines - sign up for that M-Life thing - it'll get you past alot of the long lines and crowds - especially during check in. That's it. I think if you want to stay at the MGM stay at the Signature hotel with the jacuzzi rooms. Will I be back to the MGM Grand again - NOPE - we're definitely going across the street to New York - New York. The crowd was livelier and there was soooo much stuff to do.

Number one reason I won't go back - they got rid of the Lion Habitat.  They still have lion statues though, just not the same as the real cats.

We  also had some problems getting housekeeping to make up our rooms.  Two days they missed us completely and the third time, after several calls, the Housekeeping manager came to clean our room while wearing a suit and tie!  He was super nice and a hard worker but it was 9:00 PM!  We complained at checkout and was told they would reverse the resort fees for three days, but we had to email them from home because they didn't follow through on reversing them.

First of all, the hotel is too huge. You have to walk for ten minutes in bathing clothes just to get to the pool area. The casino is by far the worst you can be in on the strip. They don't even try to remove the cigarette smell in the casino. And they brag about being a ""smoke free"" hotel. The rooms are big, but we got a room that smelled of smoke. Called the front desk twice and they did nothing about it. They worst place that smelled smoke was the closet. Couldn't hang clothes in, or stow away our suitcases there. The ventilation in the room had the same smell that other hotels use to hide the cigarette smell from their casinos. A bad and nauseating smell, that you don't want in your room. It's almost as they knew that someone had tried to smoke in our room before us, or at least knew that their ventilation system is really bad. If you want a good night sleep, choose something else. In my floor, 24th, we got woken up in the middle of the night all three nights we stayed there. From people shouting, and knocking on doors.

The champagne arrived later that night just as they said it would. When we checked out, they charged it to my room bill. Really, MGM? I didn't ask for the champagne, it was offered to me. I was able to get the charge reversed when checking out but I thought this was a dumb mistake to make. 

Next, while the room was pretty decent, the AC never went below 75 degrees. We were there in a hot Vegas summer when outside it's well over 100 degrees. I did call downstairs to have someone come look at it and was told that they would get someone to check it out for us, but no one ever came. Disappointing. 

Sunday morning when we woke up to check out, we discovered that they had shut off the water to our floor and yup, that meant no shower, no sink water, no working toilet. Called again downstairs to ask about the water and was only told ""we are working on the floor below you and the water will be off for a while"" This is really not acceptable in a hotel. Thankfully at this point we were checking out and had other friends staying in a different hotel so we took our stuff over to their place to borrow their working bathroom. 

Overall I was really disappointed in my stay. Probably won't ever book a room here again because no one seemed to care that the water was not working on our floor. What is the point of paying for a room when you have no working bathroom?",4,0,1

A commonly heard complaint is that it's uncomfortably large. Maybe that's true for those staying at MGM, but I don't find it bothersome. Another criticism is its lack of a killer show - but that's hardly a reason to write off the place.
 
The biggest problem is its location. MGM Grand is south Strip, and I'm a center\/north Strip kind of person. In addition, there's not very much else surrounding MGM that I find interesting. There's not much incentive to just wander into the place.

Then why do I visit it frequently?

** GREAT RESTAURANTS **
MGM Grand is second only to Wynn in its collection of fine dining venues. Joel Robuchon is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and L'Atelier is a much cheaper but still excellent alternative. Seablue is pretty good, and Emeril's is surprisingly good as well.

** LIVELY CRAPS TABLES **
I've only played here a few times, but whenever I did my fellow players were having a good, loud time.

** SIGMA DERBY!!!!! **
With the closing of The New Frontier, MGM Grand is now the only casino which has Sigma Derby. It's cheap, it's fun, and it goes especially well with alcohol. Play it before it disappears, folks.

The mini bar had some great items and actually were reasonably priced.  I know that $6 for a beer seems a lot but that's just about the cost if your order downstairs.  We bought bottled water off the strip and would keep it cold in ice\/water in the sink.

Maybe I am being to critical, but after partying and hungry you don't want to be told this is your only choice.

You should have the restaurants rotate staying open late for your many patrons.

Booked a two night stay with my family (Kids 5 and 3 years old) because its more family friendly than the Cosmo or Aria (where we normally stay).  My wife refuses to stay at Excalibur or Circus so MGM was a good option.

What I liked about this place:

Huge!  Lots of gaming, food and shopping.
Family friendly
Decent Sized rooms
Semi Centrally located on the Strip

What I didn't like:

The newly implemented parking\/valet fees.
Self Parking is $10 and Valet is $18 per night.  I self parked the first day and it literally took me about 20 minutes to walk from the parking structure to the room.  Pay the $18  to valet to save an hour or two of walking back and forth to the parking structure.  Its one of those thing if you forgot your phone in the room you would not walk back to go get it.

Aside from having a great pool area (there's like 18 pools here. not really, but there's a lot) and lots of dining to choose from, the hotel itself is a bit blah and outdated.

The rooms need major renovations. For what you pay, you'd expect a classier room with furniture that wasn't upholstered 20 years ago, it seems.

All my interactions with staff we excellent -- they especially went above and beyond helping me print out a concert ticket from my email.

This review is for mature adults who have children.  Yes, I understand that this is Vegas, but unbeknownst to some, there are LOTS of activities and shows to take kids to and the great pool weather is a plus.

My husband and I booked the MGM to stay with our 13 and 9 year old on our family vacation (my husband and I are in our early 30's so it's not like we're too old to have a good time either).  I had read the reviews and only some mentioned families and those were mixed on whether or not to stay here with kids.  So here is what I have to say about staying at the MGM with kids.....DON'T DO IT!!!!  Stay somewhere else!  The pool area is absolutely NOT a place to have kids.  Drunk 20 something's everywhere, making out in the pool and lazy river.  It was the most uncomfortable situation I have ever put my kids in.  We immediately left the pool (now this was a Sunday late afternoon) and decided to try again first thing in the morning, cuz, you know, these drunk people should party all night and sleep in in the morning, right?  Wrong.  My family headed down to the pool around 9 the next morning and sure enough, the same situation, just not as many people.  We then decided to switch hotels to the Excalibur which we had stayed at last year with our kids and had a great experience.  Yes, you give up the nicer room (even with the upgraded rooms at the Excalibur, they don't compare to the MGM upgraded rooms) but we had a WAY better time and experience across the way.

To review the room, it was very nice.  We had a high floor view room and it was a very beautiful room.  We loved the lighted mirror in the bathroom.  The beds though, have this box frame that the beds sit in, and the corners stuck out and all of us kept running into the box with our shins.  This was annoying, but the bed itself was very comfortable and slept great.  I would say also that the tv stand that was also the dresser was very small as there were only 3 small drawers.  If you are staying for a week this is a bit inconvenient because there was not enough room to unpack everything.  Also, the tv stations did keep cutting out, don't know why, but it was annoying also.

The property is huge, taking at least 15 minutes to walk to the front to get to the strip or even the pool.  The food court was nice but still WAY more expensive than if you walk down to the next block and eat there.  Even their McDonald's was ridiculously overpriced; $8 for a 10 piece chicken nugget meal.
My husband and I visit Vegas (by ourselves) about 4 times a year and knowing what we know now, would probably not stay at the MGM again.  The atmosphere and the crowd is just not our thing.  We enjoy Treasure Island and the bars down that way.  The rooms are great there too.

And, just one last comment:  I think it is sooooooo tacky that the MGM properties pay for people to write fake reveiws on ALL their properties on TripAdvisor.",2,4,0

Pros:

- The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

- The staff was quite helpful and pleasant (for the most part).

- There are lots of dining choices in the hotel.

Cons:

- The shower head is so low that even I had to bend backward to wash my hair. I'm pretty average height, 5' 6"", and have never run into this before at a hotel.

- The bathroom faucets fixtures were so loose the handle bases moved around every time you used them. I found this quite disturbing and annoying.

- We called to request non-feather pillows and a blanket (my husband is allergic). They brought up the pillows, which were fine, and the thinnest old cotton blanket I've ever seen. I thought they would have a regular cotton comforter, but apparently not.

- We could clearly hear our neighbors, although we can't blame the hotel entirely for that.

- Housekeeping was really loud and seemed to be roaming the halls a good part of the day. We took the Do Not Disturb sign off the door for about 20 minutes so room service could make a delivery and housekeeping tried to come in - without knocking!

- The tv was really out of date (boxy) and kind of fuzzy.

- Towels were rather stiff.

Overall, we had a great time at the MGM Grand. Fiamma was delicious and KA was amazing - see it if you can! We only stayed two nights, so the things I listed as cons might have bothered me more if we had stayed longer. It's a decent hotel in a good location.

This is one of the hugest hotels I have ever stayed. The ground floor level and lobby is huge. Of course, there are casinos there for the folks that like to get their gambling on. The food court was a little unimpressive. It has a Nathan's, a McDonalds, and  a few other places that I can't remember off the top of my head. Plenty of attractions and there are even some clothing stores to get a little shopping on. There are a couple of studios there where you can screen TV shows. There is a place there called CSI: The Experience but I haven't had the opportunity to see what it is like. There are at least a dozen bars located in the hotel itself. The Centrifuge Bar is where I dranked and the drinks were mixed just right. The prices wasn't too bad there either.

The rooms were okay, if slightly dated. They still have CRT television sets like it's still the 1990s. The rooms were well-ventilated and the beds were comfortable albeit a little stiff. The bathrooms were nice and clean, although it did take a while for the water in the shower to warm up, even at the full hot setting. And there is no free internet nor Wi-Fi in the rooms; you'll have to pay extra.

Themed after all the glitz & glory from the Wizard of Oz, with giant gold lions to emerald colors and ruby slippers.

When we lived in Coronado, for 8 years, this was our home away from home. NO!, I'm not a compulsive gambler! Southwest used to offer 2 for 1 flights or $50.00 Flights from SD to Vegas and we took advantage of them,  every chance we got, which was often. 

So you take that deal along with the MGM knowing you were coming back soon, to throw your money at them and they offer deals.. like free rooms and discounts on food!  Plus, of course, you have your player's card, which earns you points to use in many different ways.  I used them to put the cash right back in the machines.  My favorite machines were in the Lion's Den.  I also, entered their slot tournaments, every once in awhile.  Those were held over in the Emerald Isle section. 

My husband loved the poker room, until the stakes got too high, now when we go we walk across the street and gamble at the Excaliber. Easy wins there and I have tried all the casino's!  Hubby always wins at poker, no matter where we are. I wished that I could say the same about the slots! 

Rooms are very nice, clean, and with all the new hotels, it's starting to look a but older. Our rooms started getting better and better and they have different elevators for different wings and we always felt very special on our last visits, because of the upgraded comps..

The MGM Grand fits into that category for me. We hardly left the hotel during our stay, and I regretted it when we did. There is so much to do, see, and eat here that I was not all that inclined to leave. The highlight of the MGM is the pool area (my pool review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-pool-at-mgm-las-vegas#hrid:e3wToUSl1KBb3iVrgJCMcQ). I also liked the buffet and most of the various other food options. 

My gripes about the MGM is that the iron in the room sucked, and the self-parking lot is a bit difficult to get to. However they do offer free valet parking. I also did not like eating at Craftsteak, which is their upscale steakhouse (my Craftsteak review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/craftsteak-las-vegas#hrid:UpAxMxpkXW5_sIXlT7yhTw).

Should have known something was wrong with this place when the room rates were so low.  We will ignore the construction in the checkin area and the new $18 valet charge. Checked into a ""wellness"" room that is nothing but a gimmick. Shower takes a while to get hot.  When we checked in we had forgotten some items so we went down to get them at the store. We noticed that several of the restaurants were closed for two weeks, for no reason other than it is Christmas break.  Ok, fine the restaurant we wanted was open so no big deal.  We get back up to the room and someone (housekeeping) has emptied out the food and sundry portion of the mini bar.  Why someone even came in the room is apparently beside the point.  We know it wasn't theft related as our computer and iPad weren't taken nor was our bag of Christmas presents.  After explaining the situation to the hotel, we now have to  sit in our room and wait for a ""minibar technician"" to come verify that we didn't use the items ourselves. We supposedly don't have to be here for that but given what has already happened do they honestly think anyone would not stay for that.  With our reservation fast approaching we will go ahead and add that disappointment to the list now.  Then again with how few people are here that may not be a problem. 

I guess in the end it is my fault for not sticking with my usual options (which are also within the M Life group of hotels) and thinking this hotel had improved over the years.

The inside of the room was nice and clean, however the view out of our window was horrible.  The window was so filthy it was almost impossible to see through it at night, and when we did wake up the next morning, we had a view of the roof from the building below.  I believe the only view we had was the McDonald's arches from the street acrosw the way.  The spotlights located on top of the roof were facing towards our window which resulted in us being blinded all night unless we put the shade down.

 The smoke in the casino area is so strong that 4 in our party started to get ichy eyes and throats the second day. You cant avoid it since you have to go through the casino to get to the resturants and conference center, pool etc. We played on the tables and then went looking for a better casino. 

3. Pool:
Sat by the lazy river pool and around 2 pm decided to order food. Asked the waitress if we could and she said she cannot take food orders only drinks. Went to the pool side resturant and was told they were closed for lunch. (at 2 pm mind you) Was directed to a food take away bar and tried ordering food however to order food you have to have a photo id with you. You dont need said photo id to order drinks 2 feet away from this bar. Our bar tab was over a hundred but we cannot get a $14  burger without id even though I am staying in the hotel and have a room key on me. 

Decided to try out the lazy river and it jam packed with people standing in it. So as your tube goes by they make it a game to push you around. Not very fun. 

Overall this hotel seems unequipped to handle the number of rooms it has and its staff is crumbling. There are way better hotels and casinos to visit in the area. Stay far away.",0,0,0

MGM grand is beautiful and massive. Their restaurants, casino, LIONS, and entertainment (KA!!! and David Copperfield) are extensive to the point where you wouldn't have to leave your hotel.

The four stars are due to location. It is a great hotel, but a BIT far from mid-strip (such as Bellagio etc). 

The hotel rooms were clean and when we asked for an upgrade, they helped us in finding a room that suited our needs! It was a wonderful honeymoon and everyone was very helpful. Prices were great there and made our honeymoon both fun and affordable (for Vegas!)

The pool was massive! Beautiful, and grand. Their jacuzzi hot tubs are nice and warm as well! Their spa is $25\/day if you want to lounge around plus extra if you would like a massage. I decided to get the Travelers massage, which was shorter than most, but a wonderful choice for myself! My husband just took the day pass and had a blast in the jacuzzi and spa.

We dined at Diego, which I will write a separate review for...(but it is 5 stars!) and shopped at Paradiso. Pricey, but fun things for Vegas.

Our gambling was probably less than $100 total, as we are NOT gamblers, but the establishment was fun and would be great for someone who is a gambler. 

Definitely recommend this hotel!",0,0,0

Their KA Show is amazing, along with the Michael Jackson One Show by Cirque du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay, which is one of the best Cirque du Soleil Shows in Vegas.

The MGM Grand Hotel is well kept and their rooms recently went through millions of dollars in upgrades. Beautiful rooms, with great Management and Staff. 

Only one Con for the MGM:

There is a mandatory $25 a day Resort Fee, which was an issue for me. This fee included an additional $3 in taxes ($28). It's a fee you cannot decline, which I tried... So how is it taxed when it's mandatory?  It's not a purchase, so where is the tax coming from?

 Our room was great, I slept great the first night I arrived....after that I barely slept, because c'mon this is Vegas baby. We had all the conveniences right there in the hotel from the casino, restaurants, stores, and shops.

The sports book was a lot bigger and nicer than New York New York. There was also a night club at the MGM grand right across from the rain forest cafe. Which for people staying here and want to go clubbing is a great plus! It's one of the most coolest clubs in Vegas to check it out!

Tons of elevators, never waited more than a minute or two, checkin is massive and well staffed and even though there were easily 200 people in front of me the wait was less than 5 minutes.  Checkout however was frustrating.  Hundreds of people checking in mixed with poor me checking out...would it kill you to have dedicated check out lines?!?!

The inside door guard latching lock was actually broken off; confirming that someone had indeed probably broken into the room prior to our arrival. 

Then upon entering the room the drawers were opened. I'm not sure who ransacked our room but it was very peculiar sight to behold. The bed was made and the amenities were fully stocked so no complaints there. However we did find pretzels all over one side of the bed... neither my wife or myself had pretzels... 

The bathroom glass was stained with a mysterious white crust and the floor tiles had grim. The bathroom glass is a little less private than I would have liked since there were no doors deprecating the bed or bath areas and you could hear I pin drop, as well as other things. The mirror in the bath has a inlet screen with a camera facing outward into the bathroom but no option to turn it on... I have no idea if this was a poor quality spy cam or the remenant of a tv option in the bathroom they used to offer but it's creepy as hell. Oh and the mirror is on a hinge that just leads into the buildings skeleton as though someone had dug out the wall to escape Alcatraz. 

Be sure to close the room door because it doesn't close by itself. My wife and I were closing room doors left and right of people who did not close them properly. 

Outside the casino doors on the strip the MGM needs to have security shoo away the riff raff. I was constantly asked if I wanted to buy ""party favors"", or if I was a racist because I didn't want to buy the loser's mix tape he made.

We were also provided a room with a view of the airstrip. We were not told of this difference in view when we booked the room and we could not pay their upgrade as nothing was available for the first day.

We decided the MGM wouldn't sell\/book any truly awful rooms...right? Wrong. As other Yelpers have said (and thank you to those folks for comedic relief last night), the West Wing:
-looks like a college dorm. You expect to see doors open and little dry erase boards on everyone's doors. 
-smells of marijuana and urine. 
-has incredibly stained carpet (like chalk outlines were probably around them at one point).
Our room is hot, and the bathroom looks like the showers at a gym. There's a mildewed bench in the walk-in shower, along with a mildewed curtain. Hot room+no ventilation=breeding ground for mold. 
I tried to get some help last night via a DM to the Twitter account for the hotel, and...nothing. This morning I spoke to someone at the front desk.

Summary:
It was a nice hotel room, but the layout is terrible and the parking lot is atrocious.

Pros:
The room was a great. Everything was clean, neat, and in excellent condition.
I got a great deal on Expedia and would argue this is the nicest room I've stayed in for 62 bucks a night. 
Very modern room, even the bathroom had a TV.

Cons:
The layout is terrible. Getting from the parking lot to the lobby with luggage was a real drag with the escalators and inconveniently placed elevators. 
Getting to our room was a real trek. It's the biggest hotel in Vegas and it shows. From the elevator to our room was a 5 minute walk down a vertigo-inducing hallway.

The worst part was getting to the parking lot. From the entrance on the strip, it's a maze through a backlot of chassis-destroying speed bumps. Nobody should attempt entering from the strip unless you have a lifted truck. If your car is even remotely sporty, you will bottom out a dozen time before reaching the actual parking lot.",0,0,0

Never has anyone spoken to me like I was a 5 year old idiot, but they managed to do it here.We asked at check in (which was a LONG wait) how to use our dining credit that was part of the deal we got. They told us we charged the bill to the room and then it was credited. When we attempted to use our dining credit that came with our room, the restaurant told us we could not charge anything to our rooms, and we would have to go check with the front desk. After some complaining about how they should call for us because that's how customer service works and being told we would have to pay another way, we just gave in and paid with card. We went to the front desk and found the same guy we checked in with, ""Tim"". We asked him what the deal was and he told us when he asked if we wanted to keep our cards on file for charges we had said no. When we told him we definitely did not and why would we have asked how to use our dining credit only to say no, he retracted and said, ""when I asked neither of you answered.""...so apparently if you don't hear his question, it counts as a 'No.' He then said he would put our cards on file and we would have to go back to the restaurant to tell them to void the charges and charge it to our room. Obviously we said that was unacceptable, we were late for plans and had already wasted enough time dealing with their inability to communicate between restaurant and hotel. I don't care if they're independent entities, if they offer deals like this they need to be able to communicate. We told him we would not be their carrier pigeons, and he eventually relented and called the restaurant- AFTER he threatened to have my boyfriend removed by security for being annoyed with his incompetence and customer service- WAY TO BE MGM! Then he told us he was going to credit our room an extra 30 for the inconvenience and annoyance, and threatening to have us removed...that of course never happened, but why bother dealing with these people again for an extra 30 dollars? I told my boyfriend at the time I was SURE he was just saying it to get us away from him anyway. 

HINT TO MGM: don't threaten to have your guests kicked out when they're upset with your terrible customer service. It doesn't speak well about your guest relation plan. 

I mean, the room was nice and spacious- we stayed in the celebrity spa suite, but honestly, I'm not sure it's worth the hassle of every employee that works in this hotel speaking to you like you're a moron. And having to wait in long lines for EVERYTHING- from the sandwich restaurant to the front desk. They don't even offer an email address to contact them on, and when we tried to take the guest survey from our tv, that didn't work either. Shouldn't they know that every bad experience a client has gets around to 9 people, while a good one gets to 3? And if you post it on yelp, I'm sure this bad one will definitely get to more.

Update: I recently had the best stay here. I never get a chance to have a leisure trip so this was beyond needed. I was blown away when I opened the door to my suite. The room was perfect! It just felt like I was at home! The room was so luxurious with great amenities. We had a two bedroom suite with a 360 view of Vegas. The room was so clean and quite. Each room (the living room , both bedrooms, and the bar\/lounge area) had a tv and there was even a stereo system in the bar area of the room! The beds were super comfy and the sheets were so fresh and luxurious feeling! Everything was perfect. The jacuzzi tub was amazing.

The original MGM Grand was located where Bally's is presently, and it originally burned down in 1980. The fire killed 87 people. The current MGM Grand opened in 1993, featuring 30 floors and over 6,800 rooms. 

This was my second stay at the MGM Grand. My first was 10 years ago. I'll start with the good stuff:

Pros+
-The plethora of pool options (adult only, lazy river, lap pool, etc)
-All staff we came into contact with were professional and friendly
-Monorail station located conveniently in the hotel w\/ easy ticketing machines
-Blackout screens in the room
-Extremely comfortable beds
-Clean casino floors
-Several easy options to check out like texting, etc
-Shuttle pick up\/dropped off at the airport

We had some major issues with our recent 4 night stay. Definitely would stay elsewhere next time.
TOO many problems with our room(s). Yes, we had more than one room during our stay. Originally we had a room on the 10th floor. While I appreciated the blackout screens, the second screen (the sheer one) was not working in accordance with the buttons located to control it on the wall. The second thing was that the shower was not working properly: water was still coming out of the faucet in the shower instead of being directed to the shower head during showers. Resulting in very little water flow. However, the real problem is that no one answers the phone at the front desk, or any of the other options that direct you to hotel staff. We let those small minor annoyances go and enjoyed our stay the first 2 nights. However, at almost 4am on the 3rd night it was discovered (luckily without any injuries like slipping on wet floor) that the bathroom sink had leaked and flooded the entire bathroom. Everything on the bathroom counter was soaked (expensive hair dryer, expensive flat iron, everything).  We tried to call the front desk, the engineering line, anything. No one answered. WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A FIRE??!!! No wonder the original one burned down. No one answers the damn phone, what if there had been an emergency? I'm struggling how to comprehend how such a large hotel that has staff working around the clock fail to maintain the phone lines. In the end, a trip all the way down to the front lobby was necessary. We were informed that we would be given another room immediately, which resulted in 3 people having to pack up everything in a very grumpy, groggy state. No one to help. We had to go back down to the lobby to get to the correct elevator to go to our newly upgraded executive sweet on the 15th floor, at no extra cost. The only thing waved was our ridiculous, overpriced, unnecessary resort fee of $120. Our second room was decent, including 2 TVs we never used, seating area, and multiple sad outlets that when we plugged in our chargers... hung out of the sockets. Since the room had previously not been in use, the AC was not on and it took forever to get it cool enough to go back to sleep. 

Unfortunately the room issue killed it. Aside from that, there were many restaurants and bars located conveniently inside the hotel, featuring a Cirque Du Soleil theater, Brad Garrett's comedy club, an arcade, 3 Starbucks locations, a food court for quick eats, lots of fancy expensive restaurants, Rainforest café, TONS of slot machines, a high limits areas, poker tournaments around the clock, Beacher's Madhouse, Hakkasan nightclub which features Calvin Harris, the David Copperfield theater, the Garden Area,  5 pools such as the famous Wet Republic, a froyo place,  the CSI Experience, shopping in the district, a wedding chapel, and even a CBS TV experience where you could preview a new TV show and give feedback to the network. A pedestrian bridge connecting MGM to New York New York is conveniently located near Rainforest Café for when you want to eat elsewhere. As well as a bridge across Tropicana Blvd connecting the Hooter's Hotel and the Tropicana. Yes, HOOTER's has a hotel.

My major feedback is about restaurants: Offer more dining options late at night or 24\/7, and offer more IN BETWEEN OPTIONS. It was either super expensive,  4 course meals, not open, the grand buffet which was less than grand, or greasy crap in the food court like McDonald's, pizza and hot dogs. I did like Tacos N' Ritas in the food court and would recommend as the only viable option for a quick bite. Also, having more breakfast\/brunch options would be beneficial to those who don't sleep all day or for those staying up all night partying\/gambling and want to eat once the partying is over. 

With SO many hotel options in Vegas, step it up MGM. 

Won't be a returning guest,

I was so annoyed at the customer service here that I wanted to punch one of the bell staff so badly.  The housekeeping service was GREAT, very friendly and nice.  But some of the bell staff really ticked me off and needed training,  it was only 2 that made me mad.  I asked one if this was the place that we can drop off our luggage since our flight left way after our check out date.  We approach this dude when NOBODY was around and by the time he got the words out to answer us  he told us to go to the back of the LONG ASS line that formed behind us.  OK... fine!   Whatever we will.   Then we get to the front, and someone else helped us and as we were scrambling for tip money getting it out of our pockets and wallets, apparently we took too long to give him a fucking tip, he smacked his teeth and shook his head.  When we first checked in when we got there, nobody helped us with our luggage to our rooms...hello!   Then the elevators that go to floor 21-29 only had 2 of the 5 working and when you get in after everyone has hit at least 5 floors, it goes up, clears the floors and we go back to the lobby and to go back up AGAIN.

The first time we went was for our honeymoon and everything went great, the room in the honeymoon suite was huge, the bathroom had a hot tub in it and even though everything was kinda dated it was still very nice. Overall we had a great time.

The second time we went with family and made reservations well in advance specifically requesting non-smoking adjoining rooms, however when we got there they informed us that a) they didn't have any adjoining rooms available and b) they only had smoking rooms available and the only way we could get either option was if we paid extra to upgrade to a bigger room.  We decided to just keep the rooms we had, but when we got to our rooms our keycards didn't work so we had to go downstairs to have them reset, however they still didn't work when we tried them.  I don't remember exactly how many times we had to go up and down to get the the keycards reset but i do remember that it took about 2 hours and that they wouldn't give us a new room, instead they offered to let us check out 2 hours later than normal, which didn't really matter to us.

The most recent time we went we got the petite king room.  The room was pretty tiny, but it didn't really matter too much because it was just the 2 of us and we just stayed one night.  The layout was a bit weird because the door leads into the bathroom, with the toilet being the closest thing to the front door.  Theres no bathtub, but the shower is pretty large which is nice. One big complaint is that the soundproofing is terrible and you can hear everything going on in the hallways and in the rooms next to you.  During our trip we went to the casinos in the Aria, the Bellagio, and the MGM and personally I thought the MGM's wasn't as nice as the other two.  The cocktail waitresses were terrible, in the 5 hours I was in the casino they only brought me 4 drinks and even though I tipped every single time only one waitress came back to see if I wanted a second drink.  Lastly, when we ate at the buffet, nobody came to get our drink order until twenty minutes after we arrived and then they never came back to get us refills.

Honestly, if we didn't have such fond memories from our honeymoon trip I would probably just give them 1 or 2 stars.",0,0,0

Oh how I wish they had a in room coffee pot!

The reviews I read before the trip were pretty much spot on for the MGM. Helpful hint I used was to take a taxi vs the shuttle which charge $15.00 a person the taxi cost $11.00 plus tip to the hotel and $9.00 plus tip back to the airport. The taxi stands are not in the same area as the other transportation they are across the other side of baggage claim . Also if you are seeing a show at the hotel let the ticket agents know you are a hotel guest they don't automatically ask.

___________________________________


We booked this hotel the same day we left for Las Vegas and were happy to have found something reasonably priced. Our expectations were rather low since we were used to staying at the newer, nicer hotels in Las Vegas but we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were and what a nice job they had done with the renovations. Definitely better than other hotels of it's class including the Mirage and the Treasure Island. I'd say the same about the Hard Rock as well but each time I've stayed there, I've been upgraded to the King Suite in the HRH All-Suite Tower.. which is, of course, not a fair comparison.

We checked in at 2am, so there was no line. The check-out process was easy and the simplified with the availability of a stack of cards next to a check-out box by the elevator.

As is the case with many of the older casino resorts in Las Vegas, be prepared for a bit of a trek between the self-park lot to the room.",6,2,2

 We had 6 full-price rooms, big dinners, lots of drinks, shows, cabana rentals, poolside food\/drink service, and spa services.  Not that we're special, everyone is doing all of this this here.  

Nearly every single experience\/exchange was met with complete confusion and ineffective practices.

When we did interact with an employee who acted like they actually worked with the public in a giant hotel, we were surprised & walked away murmuring... well *she* was professional!  It was by far the exception and not, not, not the norm.

We went as a family with 2 young children. Check in went smoothly, although there was a lot of traffic from other guests checking out that day. We opted for the early check-in which is great for families I think. Especially if you are traveling by car and driving early in the AM. Although they did not have our requested room available at early check-in, they upgraded our room free of charge! Also, do expect that on top of the deposit that is required when booking directly on MGM site, there's an additional $200 deposit when checking in. But this is refundable. Only reason why I caution is because another guest next to me checking in was a bit shocked about the deposit. Always be prepared.

Our room was great. There were a couple things that need improvement tho. Bathroom outlet does not work, sink tends to back up, bathroom is dated but I have no problem with that, water pressure and temp for shower was not that great either.  But all in all it was a comfortable stay. Comfy bed, automatic window shutters, we slept well.

The Lazy River was great for the family. It wasn't too hard finding a place to lounge although the pool area did get crowded around noon which is expected. You can also hit up the food court and bring in your own snacks to the pool area. Theres a  shop where you can purchase last minute swimming gear, there are inner tube rentals as well. We spent most of the hot, scorching day poolside with the kids and had a blast.

Buffet was average. Attendant did not charge us for my 5 yr.old. Lots of choices for brunch although the waitresses are hard to find. Took us 15 mins to get in touch with our waitress. All in all, I would probably just go to the food court instead. Bus stops, trams, and bridges very close to the MGM. I will definitely be staying at the MGM again in the summer for the pool attractions!",0,0,1

I didn't stay there during pool season, but the pool area was quite impressive and looked like quite a bit of fun. The only downside that I saw was that the rooms are pretty small, albeit modern. The bathroom was an open bathroom with a stall for the toilet and a shower stall. Warning, the stalls are see through even with the frosted glass. The shower was big enough for two and had great water pressure and a handheld sprayer to get those more difficult areas to clean.

The best part of this hotel is the pool, hands down. Easily the best pool of all the hotels I've stayed at on the strip. I'm a sucker for lazy rivers. One of the days we were there they shut down the lazy river due to someone getting sick I'm guessing but nbd we just went to one of the many other pools. Tip: go early if you want a good spot.

I've docked one star for the overall room. It was nice but I think I've gotten so accustomed to the beautiful rooms bathrooms in some of the other resorts that this one was a disappointment. It's got nothing on the ones in hotels like the Cosmo or the Venetian. 

And one star gets docked for the service. There were two days that we were there for the whole day and our room was cleaned once and that too at 5 pm. And we were in the room at the time so it was basically just a replenishing of the towels. Not a huge deal but it was weird that we'd come back from the pool and there wasn't any fresh towels.

Overall, not a bad place. Good location, especially with the newer clubs like Hakkasan and Marquee in the area. My favorites are on the other end of the Strip but that made for some interesting walks. I personally probably wouldn't be back though, I've stayed at places that left more of an impression.",1,0,0

A friend of ours stayed in one of their suites in the 23rd floor (or thereabouts) after his wedding.  It reminded me of a singles condo in Thousand Oaks.  There was this MASSIVE balcony with a hot tub, but the condition of the walls, tile, stucco with bright green iron hand rails was terrible.  I felt like I'd died and went back to the 80's.  The inside of the suite really looked like a bad condo.

I know I'll be flamed for this, but I was disgusted to see that they had two lions in this aquarium-like set-up where people could stare at them.  It made me want to cry.  UGLY AMERICANS!!!

A couple of good things...the craps tables were fun.  The dealers were friendly and helpful and we won a decent amount of money.  The Cirque de Sole theater for Ka, was exceptional.  I'm sure that is a result of investments by the Cirque group though.",5,4,3

During such big events it will take a while to catch a cab out of here so just try to plan ahead when you're trying to get around.

As far a mammoth-sized hotels are concerned everything was as to be expected. A huge expansive casino-lobby-shopping-dining area that requires a good long hike just to get anywhere. The rooms are spacious and the beds were super soft an comfortable. 

The thing that made this hotel a bit nicer was the staff. Every single person I talked to knew their stuff. 

When I asked the girl at the concierge desk about getting to Mandalay Bay she gave me a few different options and knew that walking was not the best option for 14 women wearing stilettos.  The housekeeping woman on our floor said  hello to us with a smile.

The centrifuge bar is hilarious. The cocktail waitresses jump up on the bar, do a ""routine"" and then get back to cocktailin like they never left.

The room was big and gorgeous with nice views, high end finishes and all the amenities you could wish for at quite a reasonable price, even factoring in the much hated resort fee places on the Strip add to your room rate. Front desk staff was super nice and checkout was automated, if desired.

The Not So Good: It was tricky to make our way into the parking garage, partially due to construction projects.  The parking lot is very, very big, and thus it is a long way to carry bags into the hotel - almost like an airport. Happily for us, the front desk person warned us not to touch the mini-bar items if we did not want to buy stuff, as merely touching something can trigger a charge to your room. The included WIFI was slow and difficult to access while still bypassing the $49 WIFI upgrade that the system kept pushing.  Also, the pool and gardens were closed at night and the guard would not even let us peek. Yeah, that's his job, but we still would have enjoyed seeing the garden area.

The Weird: ~Animated~ advertisements on the Ladies Restroom faucets. I'm not kidding about that. There are 5-inch video screens on the faucets with animated ads while you wash your hands. Most of the gambling games are electronic and there are few tables staffed by human dealers.  There are even digital blackjack dealers. Pretty girls on a video screen flirt and wink ""come hither"" until someone sits down, then they pretend to deal hands. 

The Bad: ARRGH! Smoking in the lobby, casino and restaurants was a HUGE turnoff in what is otherwise a very exciting and attractive property. Your hair and clothes will stink after an evening on the first floor.

We did like the new M program offers by the MGM Grand, especially as it is accepted at all of the MGM-owned hotels - and on the Vegas Strip, that's a lot.

We did get to the hotel early in the morning, around 10am, and we waited in the slowest moving line ever to check in.  There were a lot of people waiting to check in, and maybe, 5-6 employees actually checking people in.  Our room wasn't ready but they were able to hold our luggage for us.  

We stayed in the West Wing tower, and were literally the 3rd to last room on the floor.  Had trouble finding our room, look at the picture below and you'll see why.  SO GHETTO!! You mean to tell me that maintenance at MGM has not had time to order a new room number plate for the wall?? That they had to write it ON the wall in SHARPIE??  The room itself was odd, mirrors behind the bed and next to it, some weird funky chair that was oddly positioned in the room.  The best part was the bathroom, how disgusting is it that I can see mold and mildew in the shower stall itself? Or that the all glass shower door had been busted off before, and they tried to rig it back together, so that now, when you turn on the shower, water leaks into the toilet area??? Oh, and the toilet area itself, is enclosed in glass, so, no privacy there whatsoever.  You can literally hear EVERY. LITTLE. DROP. lol 

We did find an elevator that was much closer to our room, instead of the one we took when we arrived which had us walk past 95+ rooms to finally reach ours.  Anyways, this much closer elevator took us down to the main floor, when the doors opened, we arrived to what looked like a deserted, dark, red room.  Once you walk past all of that (no signs of course) you end up in a casino.  Thank Goodness for that.

- no limo from the airport (promised) - cabbed it which was fine since it was so close to the airport
- room type not available upon checkin (6PM) - ""we can switch you over tomorrow"" - got a smoking room (wanted non) which was nicely newly furnished - but it had the remnants of the previous guest (partly opened gift basket, two empty beer bottles, etc.  Couldn't switch out - host conveniently not available.

The MGM's rooms were clean and spacious. Three of us slept comfortably on one trip and five of us slept snuggly during another. Five girls in one room is nuts, but we did it. It worked out.

The restaurants, shops, pool, Wet Republic Pool Party were all amazing here. I enjoyed Wet Republic MUCHHHH more than Rehab and even a little more that Marquee's day time pool, which wasn't bad, but Wet Republic was more fun. The restaurant range from $$$$ to food court. Everything is so awesome.

Soooooo, we decide to go there as a group of 4 guys for the NFL Playoffs to show some action (all good looking guys I might add, no homosexuality intended) and since we're in Vegas, we decided it was time to BALL OUT OF CONTROL so we got the Marquee Suite.  Check the photos on Google but it hides the truth...

After checking into VIP services downstairs we pass through the main floor and up the elevators to our room.  The hallway was only about 2,000 feet to our room (why so long?) but our room was at the end of the hallway for a reason.  Every room from left to right was one-single wooden door but ours was the last room - two double frenchwood doors.  You know how we do it!

Went in the room -

Pro's:  
2 full size bedrooms
Electronic safe for possessions
All glass shower in the main bathroom, probably 500 sq feet with 4 shower heads (in case you have lady friends with you) 
Conference room table in the main hall with 10 chairs around it
Full bar
Marble floor
All glass windows overlooking the city
Krispy Kreme Donuts are produced downstairs, hot and ready to eat!!


Con's
The TV in the room (and I'm not exaggerating) was 22 inches.  22 INCHES IN OUR ROOM AND WE WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH THE NFL PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!
They had a surround sound system that wasn't loud at all (probably so idiots don't blare their music at night while people are sleeping)
A bottle of Remy XO was $600.00 - understandable
The main bathroom was beautiful and the ""other"" guest bathroom was porcelain and white, very cheap
During half time if you wanted to place a bet, you had to run out of your room, down the hallway of death, through the long elevator ride, and you were probably into mid-way third quarter by the time you got to the betting stations downstairs.  
The marble floor ended after you got into the doorway and then it was cheap carpet
The furniture was looked like it was probably $500.00
Plus again, you had to watch the damn game on a shitty TV.

All this for $1,200.00 a night.

If you're a younger crowd, you don't want to be here.  The Palms crushes the soul of the MGM for partying, we went to Rains Nightclub at the Palms and chilled second level where you'll rub shoulders with a lot stars and the decor was much more inviting.  The MGM was kind of dark but classyish.

We told VIP services on our checkout day that this room was a joke for the money and they gave us free hour-massages and spa treatment downstairs.  The only great thing I can say if your staying here is make 100% sure that you go to their spa because you shower before your massage, you relax your muscles in a jacuzzi with bubbles that's as big as a swimming pool (I'm not kidding), then you go into a room with TV's (so that you don't miss your games) and then you get your massage treatment.  

If the best part about you staying here is the massage, I'm sure you can find better casinos to stay at!  Especially if your coming out of the pocket BIG MONEY.   If your style is sophistication and class, I would suggest the Venetian.  If you're all about partying and forgetting what day it is, go to the Palms.

I stayed 4 nights in November 2011, and my number one complaint about the place was the perfumey smell they use to cover up the cigarette smoke in the casino. That stuff made my eyes water instantly and gave me a headache after a little while. Fortunately I didn't have to spend much time in the casino, as I was there for a conference, so mostly I was just passing through. I would seriously have preferred to smell cigarettes, though. My room looked nice--it had clearly been remodeled recently-ish--but it wasn't all that clean. In addition, the light over the bathroom sink was burned out and that sink drained so slowly (and had a bizarre faucet that had to be turned on practically full force to get hot water) I almost overflowed the sink when washing my face.

Since I was at the hotel for a conference and not to gamble all my monies away, it would have been super great to have a small fridge in the room, and a coffeemaker, but I can't really point the bony finger of blame at the MGM Grand for that, since I'm pretty sure Las Vegas hotels do not have those amenities (the Palazzo didn't, and it is significantly nicer than the MGM Grand).

Often in Vegas hotels I have had to deal with hearing drunk idiots running up and down the halls all night. Not here... there was a security guard on our floor all day and all night keeping an eye on things.

My only two complaints about it were that you could not rent a tube, you had to buy one ($20 for small, $24 for large and large is not a two person one). The other complaint is that they have tons of policies posted that if you are IN the river you need to keep moving.

It's very good, with clean rooms, retro furniture, and a multi-jet showerhead, but it's not ultra-luxe. The walls are pretty thin and you hear everything that happens in the hallway. If you get one of their Twitter deals, you've got a steal.
Our room had a few issues, but the repairman came up quickly and fixed them while we were out enjoying the hotel.
The spa is good and offers fun seasonal specials. There's an upcharge on weekends and a service fee (tax and 17% tip) that they don't mention when you book your treatment.  The spa has a whirlpool, sauna and steam room, no cold pool.  For me, that's a slight disadvantage.  The spa at the Palms has one, and I enjoy a cold dip after a good sauna session.  The shower was awesome, with a huge rainshower head.
The food is very good.  Avoid the Studio Cafe, though.  It's not bad, but there are much better breakfast deals on the Strip, like Hash House a Go-Go at Imperial Palace.

Well I certainly will not pretend I know everything about this hotel, but I shall give you my ""2 cents""... hope them pockets are deep! Kidding of course!

I've always enjoyed this hotel. While being disabled I found the walk across their large casino to get to Studio 54 proved quite challenging (especially when I forgot my tickets one time) I can still admit to being a pretty big fan of this casino\/hotel.

They have many pools available... including at least one that features a club.

They have many awesome restaurants for any budget... I highly recommend checking out Project Pie!

There is a ""Fat Tuesdays"" available there and that's a big ""hell yeah"" and tradition for me = Alcoholic Slushies!

They have many types of entertainment... not just gambling and clubs, but also comedians, magicians, Cirque du Soleil shows, Boxing Matches, bands, MMA Matches, and so much more.

There is a monorail stop to take you to other hotels which is nice.

The rooms proved both spacious and comfortable. They offer many types of rooms for all budgets!

The staff is extremely nice.... In all positions. Their large front desk has a lot of people working so checking in\/out should move pretty quickly!

They are located right near many other great hotels as well.

I will say there's not a whole lot other than some of the entertainment to really entertaining the kiddies, but I guess it all depends on where their interest lies. NY NY is right across the street which has a great roller coaster and there is also jousting nearby at Excalibur (Tournament of Kings which includes dinner.)

I guess my only issue... and I'm willing to admit that it's my own fault for not doing more investigation is that Studio 54's clientele for the most part looked like they could have gone to the original Studio 54 in NYC. I felt really out of place there... oh well nothing a little alcohol couldn't assist with right?

- bed bugs
- unchanged sheets - found rogue t-shirt tucked at the top of the mattress, indicating that they didn't change the sheets from the last stay
- terrible customer service from the general manager on duty
- unanswered assistance from the corporate guest services team

Be VERY wary when you're looking into booking your stay here. While mishaps are forgivable, bad customer service is not.

Note to MGM Grand LV - you should pay better attention to your guests to build loyalty, rather than ignore them and pull some PR stunts (i.e. sponsoring bloggers' bachelorette parties) to try to revamp your image.",6,0,0

The good:
--Arriving\/checking in was quite easy with a lot of staff onboard and a very large entranceway for vehicles.
--Though I am not a fan of Casino restaurants, MGM Grand does offer a wide variety of fine dining, casual dining, and fast food.
--Proximity.  MGM Grand has its own exit to the Monorail, and the hotel itself is close enough to some of the other major casinos.

The bad:
--I stayed in the West Wing, which had pretty below average rooms.  It was a very small room (maybe the smallest I've stayed at).  The mirrors that surrounded the room kind of faked you out in thinking that it was bigger than it was (occasionally running into the mirror isn't fun either).  Plus, the hallways around the West Wing were in bad shape, and they were a little hot as well.
--I've had better luck at winning at Caesar's.
--Avoid the Starlane Mall.  It reminds me of CityWalk in Los Angeles--just a bunch of trinkets and trash.  A waste of time.

All-in-all, MGM Grand is a decent hotel and good enough if you are staying in Vegas (though I would avoid rooms in the West Wing).",2,0,0

The room was modern, large and clean.  Very happy with the room!   Even though you're barely in your room when in LV, it's still a nice treat to come back after a long, crazy day and enjoy some creature comforts.

Here's what I am not too happy about: 
 1. No coffee in the rooms.  Wait what?
I had to put a cap on my bed head to ride 26 floors down and wait in line at the casino Starbucks.  At 7:30am I was #15 in line. 

Still not happy: 
2.  I paid $50 at the pool for 3 drinks and 1 soda. They also wanted another $12 to rent a tube for the pool. The cabanas are additional too.  Everything I encountered felt like an a la carte purchase.  This is all in addition to the $30 resort fee. I expected more especially when we are here to spend money in the casino. 
I also paid $8 for a pint of Corona draft at the bar nearest the tram station.  I treated 4 people to a beer--that's $32 for 4 Coronas--it's excessive.  I could have bought 3 six-packs and still spent less.

And,  this understood inconvenience that people have to deal with at casinos:  
3. The smoke. 
Wow- the smoke. It became worse as the evening progressed. 

Las Vegas is not inexpensive as some people assume.   Most of the slots were a dollar a pull and I couldn't find a card table for less than $10 a hand. 
I did wind up finishing the night with a cocktail while realizing that the table next to me was charging $100 minimum a hand for Blackjack.

Rooms: Ok

Parking: long, long walk to rooms.  Valet it.

Pool: Felt like it was miles away.  Not cool when you've got wet kids in tow.  They didn't allow inner tubes from Mandalay (a sister property) so you're stuck renting.  Pool area is not kid friendly by early afternoon.  Drunk parties everywhere.

Casino felt cramped, but that may have been because they were doing construction.  Whatever the case, it was distracting.

Food options are decent, ranging from fast food (McD's, Nathan's) to fancy upscale restaurants.  Don't forget about the few places in the walkway to the parking garage.

Clean and nice hotel..they have live lions from a local refuge.. they just sleep all day. 

Within the hotel there is shopping, television show\/movie viewings (you can make a quick $100), and the Sony experience to test out 3D televisions and video games.

Studio 54, was packed.... with older people. Even though they played decent music- we took advantage to the comp admission for about an hour until we hit the next venue.

Playing at their tables, I like the roulette and black jack the best. The dealers were nice. I prefer gambling at Paris hotel instead.

After checking in I called the front desk and they said that the 'strip view' is something that they do not guarantee and they no longer have automatic blinds in any of the rooms.
My only complaint would be that they should seriously consider updating the website and mentioning that even if you book a room with a view  it is not guaranteed (she said it was a request that they may\/may not honor depending on availability)

Also if you need housekeeping you have to request for it,something we were blissfully unaware of so we ended up with an unmade bed (not that I cared or did I)

I stayed in a regular room, which had nice decor, was clean and had a view of the strip.

Yes the place is HUGE, and yes I did get lost. yes the lions look sad and cramped...and while we were there, two guys were always in there just sitting with them. (I assume they were trainers or keepers of some sort, but why they were always in there made no sense.)

All the catered food for our events was delicious, no complaints there. I did visit Tabu their ""lounge"" bar because some guy  in a suit (I assume he was staff) handed us wrists bands good for free cover and an hour of free drinks; had fun dancing the night away. (FYI: Tabu has the crazy trippy wall that was painted to change depending on the color light being shined on it. At first we thought it was a image projection, but no its the actual wall. The best way I can describe it is those ridged pictures you get sometimes that change depending on how you bend or move the card in the light.)

It didn't hurt that our group of 11 was blessed with beautiful sunshine and 85-degree weather. For a fantastic experience in Vegas, a stay at the MGM is a must for the sole reason of the pools - Lazy River will go a long way towards killing that hangover from the previous night!

The hotel concierges were very helpful, there was no problem checking in; all of our questions were answered courteously. Room service was very helpful as well, they provided us extra bedding (without charging us for the additional occupants, thank God!) and fixed a lamp that wasn't working.

To be honest, the MGM does not have the highest-quality rooms, the interiors were about the same level of decor as a Holiday Inn. The showerhead looked like it hadn't been replaced in decades, and the water pressure was very harsh. The AC system worked only sporadically, which I'm sure will be a problem for them in the summer months when the temps climb to the 120s and the windows still don't open :)

All told, I would recommend the MGM for anyone who wants to do Vegas to the max - casinos, bars, nightlife, pools, ""the world is your oyester"" type of trip.

There were also HUGE crowds of conventioneers in the MGM that created lines of  50+ people at each Starbucks, so I'd check that first before booking again. We had to get in an almost scary crunch of people at the elevators one day as the convention let out.

Pretty much felt like we were going it alone with no casino host.  No welcome in our room when we arrived, nobody there to speak with before we left town, just no ""Melinda touch"" on our last trip.  We had talked at length and made a decision on this trip we were not going to return to MGM after so many years there, but would try a different hotel hopefully looking for another ""Melinda Marshall-like"" connection.  


Throughout the years she has always stayed in close touch before our visit, setting up credit lines, suggesting shows in town, great restaurants, and all the time giving us a personal touch by remembering our likes and dislikes as if she was a family friend for years.  In 46 years of traveling to Las Vegas, staying in the Dunes, Riviera, Landmark, Flamingo (for many years), the Rio (for many years), Paris, and then finally coming to the MGM and finding her (when we inquired as to the best casino host here), never had we had such a professional, personable host.

I was a frequent guest at MGM for nearly 25 years, I know dealers and pit crew that have been there since day one. So it pains me to have to write such a harsh review, but in speaking with other players they were expressing some of the same frustrations.

I always request a high floor (as I jokingly told my Casino Host, if I jump out the window I want to do more than break my ankle) for several trips now I keep getting 4-8th floor, that may be considered a high floor in Kansas, but this is Vegas!

I was invited to their Executive Poker Tournament that just took place, since I would be busy playing Poker most of the day, I requested with my host that I get a Terrace Suite, I even advised him that if my recent play did not rate a Terrace Suite that I would be happy to pay for it. He booked a Terrace Suite and it showed up on my itinerary as being comped (since I was willing to pay for it, it was a pleasant surprise) A week before my trip I noticed that I had got bumped out of the Terrace Suite and my reservation was now for a Spa King (it showed comped at $1,800 for 2 nights) First of all, I can book online and Spa Kings don't command $900 a night. So I was disappointed, text my host that I noticed I had got bumped from Terrace but he never responded to that. I didn't take further issue as my account was still noted as always ""request high floor"" When I checked in to the VIP lounge I was on the 5th floor, I asked the hostess politely if it was not noted that I requested a high floor, she rudely barked back that there were no high floors available and that the room was free! I guess I must look like a mooch that would rather get a free shit room than pay for a nice one?  Bottom line, after many years, the rudeness and complete disregard for simple notes in the system has leaving MGM properties for others. I frequent Vegas 1-2 times a month, restaurants welcome me in and know me by name, dealers and pit bosses know me and my wife by name, yet every time I've checked in at the VIP lounge they seem not to realize I'm there every month, even if they can't remember me, you would think a business like MGM would have a system to alert their staff of a frequent guest.

Luckily my dad checked the room bill the day after & saw a $65 dollar fee which was quickly removed from the bill once the front desk was called. They apologized & said it was a mistake. If someone tells you you're going to be comped something then make sure it's actually free & double check that bill !

We had a rude waitress at the lobby bar. I ordered my drink but when my parents were still thinking she just walked away. When she came back my mom ordered a pina colada (the only thing she drinks) & was rudely told that they don't have pina coladas bc they don't have a blender. They also told my dad they ran out of blue moons so we left. How the heck do you run out of blue moons??? Go run to the gift shop & grab some or go ask another restaurant in the hotel if you can snag a few. 

Valets always friendly they just take FOREVER. Waited 35 minutes for our car, no joke. 

Overall the place was alright. Would I stay here again ? Yeah but other than the rooms or maybe a show I'd avoid the rest of the hotel altogether.",0,0,0

Even though a bit older, MGM offers nice clean rooms at reasonable rates. Over the years they have done upgrades that keep the decor and rooms nice and modern.

Here is my breakdown.

-Casino-I am not a big gambler, but my bf is. The dealers are always very nice and friendly, and the servers come around regularly and provide drinks. Never too busy, so you can usually get a spot at the table of your choice.

-Pool
* Decent, but nothing spectacular.

-Restaurants-I have tried a few here. 
*Wolfgang Puck-Very good. The pizza we ordered here was great, Nice modern decor. Service was great as well
*Pearl-Great! I love sushi, and they were awesome. Their fish was fresh and flavorful. They offered some nice sake choices as well. Very nicely designed interior and friendly service.
*The grand wok-Eating healthy in vegas can be hard. TGW is a great healthy option thats quick and easy to grab. Everything is made to order and cooked on the spot. They offer a variety of meats and veggies to suite everyones taste.
*Sugar factory-I have left a great 5 star review for the main SF. Although smaller, this SF is awesome as well.

Shopping-They offer a variety of little shops and boutiques here ranging from souvenirs to rolex. They have a women's boutique here that I absolutely love, but I am blanking on the name. It sells both high end and moderate priced clothing, shoes, and bags. They have a great selection and always seem to have a sale going on.

Shows-My boyfriend gambled his way to a comp show the first day we were staying here, so off to KA we went. I have been to many CDS shows in Vegas, and always loved them. KA was good, but not great. I would rate is a 4\/5. I guess Le Reve still has my vote.

Nightlife-I used to enjoy MGM's nightlife, but as with all clubs they have their time. Although their clubs are still busy, they are not my goto places any longer. Crowds are not great, and they never really have any good talent. Bigger clubs like XS always have the big name dj's. However, i am very excited for Hakasan to open. I think this new spot will be an awesome addition to MGM and re-vamp their nightlife. You can't go wrong with Tiesto as a resident either.

Overall I really like MGM and would recommend it. Nice clean rooms, great service, nice choice of restaurants, and good casino. Lastly at a moderate price, you can't go wrong.",2,0,0

Me and my friends booked 2 rooms at the MGM about 4 months in advance. We spent $450 to stay 3 nights (Fri-Mon). My friend got there in the morning while I did not get there until later at night. When she arrived she talked to the receptionist about getting us a room on the same wing of the same floor. As she had my confirmation number, the receptionist said that she had me all set up in a room on the 8th floor.

I arrive that night, and am told that I am not set up in a room. I am told that the closest room I can be in would be on the 13th floor. I am told that this floor is on the same elevator as the 8th floor, which is not true. I get into the room, and immediately notice that there is other people's luggage in the room, and that it is a King bed instead of the two Queen beds I had requested. I go back down and apparently I was given another couple's room which had already been checked into, great.

I am given a room on the 10th floor, which is in the same elevator as my friends. We go back up and move all of our luggage again, and find that the new room is uncleaned. There was food everywhere and the beds were not made. I call the front desk and explain what happened and say I want to talk to the supervisor, and am put on hold. After 15 minutes on hold, I call back, and the same thing happens. I walk downstairs and demand to talk to the supervisor. She is extremely rude to me, tells me not to be rude to her, and doesn't offer to comp any part of the room. She tells me all she can do is give me a $75 buffet credit. She gives me a room on the 2nd floor which is in a completely different tower from where we already were. I tell her I don't want a room this far away and she says it's the only one available. 

We go back up to our friend's room and my friend decides to have her dad call the hotel. I end up talking to a customer service rep who gives me another room on the 7th floor and a $100 food and beverage credit. We decide to go to the room after going out for the night. Upon returning to the room later in the night, we walk in and the room is DIRTY again. Has not been cleaned, stuff is everywhere. We call downstairs, and they tell us they can send up a cleaning crew. We have to go sit in our friend's room for an hour in the middle of the night while they clean our room. We are finally comped for that night after changing rooms 4 times.

The next day, one person showers and the entire bathtub fills up with junk and will not drain. We go downstairs to request a plumber. While downstairs we talk to another lady who had just been given the wrong room as well. Her and her 10 year old daughter had just walked into a room with a naked man in it. Obviously the entire hotel has a problem. The water goes down after the plumber comes. Someone else gets in the shower, and the same thing happens. We end up having to shower in our friend's room because the bathtub is so disgusting. Also, the TV is extremely old and the channel up button doesn't even work. That night upon returning, our room keys no longer work. We have to go BACK downstairs to get a new set of keys. We finally get both Friday and Saturday night comped because of how ridiculous everything was.

I don't know what we would have done if our friends were not in another room. Everyone was extremely rude to us and the only reason we got the nights comped is because we had my friend's dad call 5 times and complain. I will never ever stay at this hotel ever again, and I suggest that unless you want to risk a terrible hotel experience like this one, that you don't either. This was a terrible waste of time and money.",4,2,2

The MGM Grand suffers from simply being too large. The trek from the elevator banks to the monorail is onerous, the trek from the elevator banks to spa\/gym, strip, sportsbook, all onerous.

The details suffer when you have 6,852 rooms. The hotel-provided lotion in the bathroom had been tampered with, bearing a greasy finger smudge (lube?) and a dark bit of foreign matter I had no interest in examining too closely. I noticed it since the bottle hadn't been properly closed, although it had been positioned correctly on the toiletry tray.

The ironing board screeched like a parrot when I opened it. The cover was stained and lumpy. I struggled for a good five minutes and nearly lost a bit of my finger attempting to close it.

The ""art"" hung in my room was identical to the ""art"" hung in my room the first time I stayed at the MGM over eight years ago. Patrick Stewart, Lauren Holly, someone I don't recognize, and a pretty lady next to a lion. Depressing yet familiar. 

The thermostat has three settings: off, not enough, and too much.

The beds were comfortable enough.

The towels weren't soft, but not scratchy either. I'm guessing somewhere between reasonably-priced boarding school and prison. 

Internet access, fitness facility at usurious rates. I guess the MGM Grand feels that if you are attempting to conduct business to better yourself financially, or if you are attempting to exercise to better yourself physically, you are not gambling. Personally, I can do the third much more, if I don't have to pay for the first two.

The MGM Grand has positioned itself at the lowest common denominator. It has everything, but everything is kind of crappy and overpriced. It follows other casinos in every aspect but size.

*Edit

My initial review was disingenuous, I had a bad time at the tables and I took it out on the hotel. The MGM Grand is a fine hotel and reasonably priced. It's not fantastic, but it's a decent value (if you can get a discounted rate). The rooms are clean, the AC is cold, and the showers are hot. You don't need much outside of that.

Me and my then boyfriend (soon-to-be fiance since he proposed on that trip, now my husband), went to Vegas and stayed at MGM for our 5 year dating anniversary. We checked in, and headed up to our room in the ""west wing"" section. We're super excited, luggage in hand, unlock the door- and there's a woman laying on our bed! Umm, WTF?! She's as surprised as we are... Apparently her husband was down at concierge changing their room since they didn't want to be close to the elevator. Either way, it was shocking to say the least! I'm not quite sure how they managed that to screw that up? She left immediately and we just kept the room since we were exhausted. Later on that night we realize why it's so terrible to have a room by the elevator. Every time it's used you hear a loud DING ""GOING DOWN."" So obnoxious! Especially at 3am! The plus side was that we received a special ""gift"" of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne- that was actually intended for the people who originally had the room! At that point we didn't feel like saying anything since we had no idea who or where they were, and frankly, we deserved it! 
The hotel is nothing special. Rooms are meh and the west wing is super dark. It's reasonably priced and has some good restaurants. I'm not a fan of the lions there.

My biggest gripe is the location of the 1st through 3rd floor rooms in the West Wing Tower.
I was allocated a room on the third floor in the West Wing Tower and it is almost impossible to find as the signs are a mess. The central elevator gives you access to floors 4 and up. There are signs to floors 1-3, but these seem to lead to nowhere. There is an access door with a card reader where the last sign to floors 1-3 point to, but this does not work. When I arrived I had to walk via the 4th floor through a seemingly endless corridor to arrive at the elevator to get me back down to the 3rd floor and in my room. So word of advice, make sure to get a room on floors 4 and up (if possible) to prevent roaming the halls. Not fun when you have travelled 14 hours with a 9 hour time difference.

The first day I checked in at the MGM they gave me the group rate of $199. Not too bad for a Tuesday night in November. But then when I wanted to extend my stay 1 night, Wednesday night, they wanted $835. What!?!? That's right, $835. The check-in person said it's basic supply and demand, MGM is short on rooms - the price goes up. 

Let me be the first to say that $199 is a lot for what you get at the MGM, but bearable. However, $299, $399 or more is just ridiculous and $835 is insane. 

The rooms look like they're from the mid-80's and the amenities suck. There is no mini bar in the room.  The clock radio looks like the $9 special from Target. There's no way to hook up your iPod to anything to play your music.  The mirror in the bathroom is showing it's age with water damage to the bottom corners.  The shower \/ tub grout is grey from use. There is only 1 power port on the desk to charge your portable electronics and the TV is the kind your grandma has. No, not a flat screen, it's a 27"" color box TV. 

On the positive side, the room is clean, the tile on the bathroom floor looks like marble and the AC works great - but that's were it ends.

My recommendation when booking your room here is to visit their Facebook page and see what deals they are currently offering. I went just a week ago and was able to get a Grand Tower Room with a King bed and a killer view of the strip (the New York New York rollercoaster included) and $50 pool credit (which was used to get free drinks) for a grand total of $79. The room was very clean and comfortable--the only thing lacking would have to be a minibar. I must say the bed might be one of the most comfortable I have ever lain myself upon. 

The pictures of the Rat Pack along with other famous classic actors\/actresses scattered throughout the hotel definitely adds to the allure. Prancing down the corridors at 5am passing a picture of Old Blue Eyes definitely feels like a win. You definitely want to put on your Sunday best 24\/7, pearls included.

The restaurants and entertainment are fantastic; I'm a huge fan of being able to just go downstairs from my room rather than having to trek clear across the strip in search of Vegas fun. Wolfgang Puck's makes for a fantastic late night snack (and affordable - I recommend splitting the club sandwich between 2, with a grand total of $15) and Crazy Horse Paris is hands down the best entertainment in all of Vegas. The pools are incredible (Wet Republic was fun as well, but only for 21+.... for those of you with kids, find a babysitter) and the bars make some delicious bevies. My advice for by-the-pool alcoholic consumption: Spend the $22\/$24 for the souvenir margarita (32 oz.) and save it... the refills are only $11. It is the most cost effective way of going about margaritas\/daiquiris.

We were told we had a strip view.  When we finally made it to our room we had a view of the airport. Really? That is the strip? Yeah, I guess so, the landing strip. Whatever.  We dont spend a lot of time in the room anyway so we didnt bitch but come on it was our 15th anniversary - no upgrade or strip view?

My favorite part about this stay was the pool area. It was beautiful and tropical, with multiple pools and a lazy river. There were many secluded spots to put down a lounge chair and find your own little piece of heaven. LOVED it. If I remember correctly I think the lazy river also had an area that went by a ""waterfall"" it was so pretty! 

I don't really gamble so I can't speak much to the casino. But I do love the location of the hotel. It's near New York New York, Excalibur, Luxor, Tropicana....lots of options for casino hopping. 

I want to try other Vegas hotels but I can't say a single bad thing about MGM Grand. It's a safe bet you'll have an amazing experience there.",0,0,0

My husband and I returned today from our stay at the hotel the past 4 days. We picked this suite based off the amenities and details described on the website. It clearly states that you will have a view of the strip...we had a view of a building and a abandon parking lot. Also that their is a TV in the bathroom...totally no TV in their.

Check-in was a breeze kinda in and outta there. The TV signal as others have stated was terrible. We actually had to have two maintenance guys come work on the TV. The fix was only temporary. It continued to cut off during out stay. The internet wasn't as bad...just every once and a while.

Another issue we had was with the iron, it didn't work. Called again to guest services to have another iron sent to the room. Waited about 20 min and no one came. At this point we were rushing because we did have a show to catch at the NYNY. Called again and they said someone would come up. About 5-10 min later we received it.

My husband and I thought that the resort fee included access to the fitness center....it doesn't. So since we have a membership to the 24 Hour Fitness, we went to one about 2.5 miles away. While there I purchased two towels that clearly state on them ""24 Hour Fitness"". Why am I mentioning this, well housekeeping took the towels from our room. I had the towels open on the table so that the words can be seen. I called guest services and explained the situation. They had security call me and it was a simple process....head to guest services, sign the waiver, and receive the cost of the towels. Easy and simple right? NOT!!!!!!! We completely got the runaround.  We were sent to guest services, to lost and found, to security and back to guest services again. This is a HUGE hotel so the walk isn't fun. This process took over 30 minutes when I expected no more than 5. 

Oh by the way, housekeeping comes to the room many times a day. So if you would like privacy, put up that sign because they will walk in there. Overall I did like my room but I never had to call or deal with the hotel staff so many times. Calling guest services each day of my trip isn't what I planned to do. The taxes are kind of ridiculous as well. Would I stay here again??? They would have to have an amazing deal going on. But as of right now....no.",1,1,0

1. You can buy frozen margaritas in the cafeteria section of the hotel.  Save the glasses - the margaritas are refillable at a reduced price.  Definitely one way to budget drink in this hotel.
2. The monorail is closer, but MGM property hotels have a tram system on the west side of the strip that can get you up and down the strip for free.
3. The hotel complex and gaming floor is huge.  I recommend getting a map at check in so that you have an easy guide to finding stores and entertainment options in the hotel.

My MGM Experience
I stayed at the MGM Grand in February and I had an extremely positive experience at the hotel.  First and foremost, I give the staff at the MGM Grand major kudos for exemplary service.  

When booking the hotel, I booked a tower spa suite and I had requested a high floor.  I got a 20th story, strip view accommodation.  On first night of my stay, the person staying in the room above me overflowed their tub, causing it to 'rain' in my suite.  The hotel had to move me to a new room.  The only other tower spa room available was on the 4th floor of the hotel.  The hotel staff, seeing that I specifically requested a high floor room, upgraded me without my prompting to a Tower One-Bedroom Suite on the 19th floor.  Definitely an excellent way to rectify what could have been a major problem with my stay and I give the staff full compliments on handling the scenario.

The Location
Located at the southern end of the strip, the MGM Grand is at the center of the action.  The MGM Grand is one of the closest on-strip hotels to the airport - making cab fares to and from McCarran some of the cheapest of the major strip hotels.

The Las Vegas Monorail has its first stop right at the east end of the MGM Grand hotel - so you can easily traverse the Las Vegas strip from the hotel. There are also plenty of bus options from the MGM Grand to go up the strip or to downtown Las Vegas.  A short walk to the west side of the strip will connect travelers to the free MGM tram that moves customers between MGM property hotels on the strip

The Hotel Grounds
The MGM Grand is a dictionary definition mega resort.  Built in the early 90s to be the premier namesake of the MGM corporation, the hotel originally had a classic Hollywood theme.  Guests would walk through the mouth of the MGM logo lion to check in at concierge and the hotel's exterior is tinted green in reference to the wizard of Oz.  While a lot of the old Hollywood look at feel has been renovated out of the interior - the MGM lion was moved away from the entrance - the MGM Grand still has the feel of a well loved namesake hotel.  

As one of the largest hotels in the world, with over five-thousand rooms, the hotel contains one of the two largest casino gaming floors in the city of Las Vegas.  The hotel grounds are lined with shops, eateries, theaters, fine dining, bars, clubs, and pools.  There is no need for guests to leave the hotel - as this hotel has dining and entertainment options for families, single travelers, and can accommodate mid-range to high-budget travelers.

The Hotel Rooms
I've stayed in two different types of suite.  Both suites had comfortable bedding, were clean, and contained excellent details and styling.  The tower spa suite sincerely impressed me from a design standpoint - the room was lit by a stage light.  The bathroom in the one bedroom suite was huge - the soaking tub could have almost fit a canoe.  Both rooms came with an assortment of tub products - from bubble bath suds to bath tea - giving us a spa experience within our hotel rooms.

Overall
I would highly recommend the MGM Grand to Vegas vacationers.  The MGM Grand is high on my personal list of hotels to stay at in Vegas, and I expect to stay here again in the future.",7,0,3

If I would have known that they were going to leave the keys inside my brand new car for a thief to easily get in, I would have never used their valet. although my car was not stolen or damaged (thank goodness) MGM management should take different measures to ensure the valet procedures are reevaluated, to avoid bigger issues in the future when a car does get stolen.

MGM houses the Cirque show known as KA, which is the primary reason we were there.  

And off we go.....first of all - there was immense construction going on, which made the whole finding the damn entrance or one that was open a challenge.  Upon strolling in and glancing around - I could see why remodeling seemed like a grand idea.  The place was looking a bit worn to say the least but then again perhaps I was spoiled from being a temporary resident of the Mirage.  

Inside - looked like the typical casino resort.  Spread out in ten different ways with different clubs, restaurants and shops in various corners and so forth.  We actually found a great sushi place inside where we decided to dine - see other review for that one.  The main area seemed much more inviting than the weird entrance we came through.  Didn't win a damn thing, but that seemed to be the gambling trend of the week.

The theater area for KA was fine, but the theater itself was absolutely stunning - see my KA review for more on that.  Once the show was done and more money slipped into those evil machines - we were off to stroll back up the Strip.  

When it came down to choosing which hotel to stay out - it was between the Mirage and MGM.  Would be curious to see what the rooms and so forth are like at this resort for future reference.  Based on some the reviews....I'm relatively happy that I went with the Mirage.",1,1,0

Big mistake; don't try to use their mini-trig for you own food. No leftovers allowed in Las Vegas!

Was interrupted at 12:30 on Christmas day so they could check the mini-bar. We never used anything, but had moved things around so we could fit a sandwich in. That's a $50 fine (she was kind enough to waive the fee). She asked if I read the label on the frog (can't post pics right now), I said no, I'm here to relax, not read a thousand signs.

They could have checked bar when cleaning the room, or at checkout... Frig now has sensors, so don't let kids even touch it!

Not only that they actually take the money out its not a hold I explained to the front desk girl I had never done that and she got defensive and said well we do here.

My husband, one year old son and I were passing through vegas to get to Utah. We decided to stay in Vegas for two nights to enjoy the sun and pools, etc. We chose MGM for their pools and intended to spend both days in and out of pools between my son's naps. 

The day we were supposed to arrive in Vegas, I received an email from MGM for ""pre check in"" via email. I completed the check in process, provided my credit card information and notified them that we would be arriving very late at night because we were hopeful that we could get my son to sleep on a late night flight from Seattle (we were unsuccessful in achieving sleep). 

We finally got to the hotel around 2am with a very tired little boy in our arms (not our finest parenting moment). We were greeted with (what we later learned) was a 1.5 hour line to simply check in to the hotel.  I found an alternative line to beg the staff to get us a room as we had already completed the ""pre check in"" process online. 

Long story short, in spite of our reservation and pre-checked in status, we were diverted to a different hotel off the main strip. They had given the room away. They had given ALL the rooms away in the setting of double booking and there were MANY dissatisfied guests.  With tears in my eyes (I was tired y'all) and a crying kid in my arms I begged them for a room, but they sent us away regardless.  They did comp the night at the new hotel which was not sufficient for me.

We got about an hour in at the pool the next evening after repeating the check in process with MGM grand. To be fair, the pools were awesome, the rooms were meh.  

We will not be returning to the MGM Grand.  I was appalled by their inability to simply provide a room in the setting of a reservation and precheckin (and the knowledge we would be arriving late) to a family with a young baby in the middle of the night. Not cool.",3,0,0

My most recent stay was in a renovated room with a nice flat screen TV and an entertainment console (could never get it to work though). There is a mini-bar fridge and the requisite $20 cans of nuts on top. There is an ""entertainment"" kit containing USB, AV and other media cable for $30 + fees. Be careful though, the dry items are on a tray with a weight sensor and the items in the refrigerator are on a sensor. If you move it you will be charged and you have to argue with the front desk to get the (not actually consumed or used) items removed from the bill.

The ""resort fee"" went up to $25, which is insane since they took out some of the perks.

The check-in process has changed a bit. Instead of picking a line, or being directed to one and hoping it moves quickly there are now two queues. Both lines moved quickly and now people who have complicated check-ins or would previously hold up the line for whatever reason don't prevent the line from moving.

Overall I stay here because they have a good rate for their players club members. But we don't spend a lot of time besides sleeping in this resort.",0,0,0

The MGM Grand Hotel is big. In fact, it's the biggest and most spread-out hotel you'll find anywhere. Rooms range between 3-4 stars. The accommodations are better than they were 5 years ago, but still kind of average hotel rooms ... which is no surprise when you think of the volume of rooms and people they must accommodate.

Three stars means a-ok and the MGM is exactly that ... a boring, but very BIG A-OK.",32,25,26

The customer service here is A1.  I expected it to be douchey & pretentious like its spokesperson Floyd Mayweather, but it was a great stay! Most people who give MGM a low rating are folks who stay on the weekend or had a standard room. Any Vegas hotel ends up being annoying and subpar in a standard room or on the weekend.
Go to booking.com or mgm.com and book in advance for a suite to make the stay more enjoyable. 

We arrived during check in rush hour and the lines were long like theme park ride lines. However the check in counter was well staffed and a check in that could've taken an hour and a half only took 30 mins. From concierge to bell staff everyone is professional and accommodating. 

Our Tower Spa Suite was wonderful! It you get one make sure to get a high floor, especially if you're on the airport side or else you'll only have a view of raggedy hotels and parking lots. Strip view is preferred of course. 

Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the cleanliness of the spa tub. It could've used a better scrubbing. I had to re-clean it before we got in. 

Food court is nice. The pizza place, Bonano's, is really good. 

The lazy river pool is really cool with a current that keeps you moving without swimming or paddling. Cost $20 to rent an inner tube.


Valet is free and if you're there during the week the waits aren't long too retrieve your vehicle. I would not recommend staying at a large casino\/hotel property like this on the weekend. Better to do the suite options like Signature, Elara, Vdara, Palms Place for less crowd hassles.

I booked my room with Expedia and I specifically asked for a non-smoking room (it even showed so in the receipt from Expedia) however when I got to the hotel the receptionist told me that ""that's only a request and they are not obligated to do that""
They were very rood when I asked for a nonsmoking room and they tried make me pay for a ""oops I see a nonsmoking suite but you'll have to add $50 a night"" and also they changed the ""resort fee"" to $30 a day!!! 
now you would think that's it but wait... there's more

They charged me for alcohol in the mini bar which I didn't take - and they charged me twice !!! for the same thing which I didn't use!!! 
and as I already paid for the resort fee when I arrived they charge me (yes again) when I checked out for the same resort fee!! 

so I asked to talk to the manager for whom I needed to wait 45 minutes and after an hour of insisting he finally was convinced I didn't use the mini bar (I never do)

So after I got back from my vacation what do I see in my credit card records? YES they charged me twice for the mini bar and twice for the resort fee

seriously I don't think a hotel should act like that - I'm never going back there and I told all of my friends that and now I'm telling you. 

so just to summarize:
1. it's far from everything on the strip, so if you wanna go to a good show you have to walk a lot which is still faster than taking a cab cause you get all the traffic on the strip.

2. they take resort fee which is a lie - basically a way for them to take money for nothing.
I stayed at the Flamingo hotel before and they didn't take any imaginary fee!! 

3. the reception clerks are idiots - sorry I can't find any other words to describe them. oh and of course the managers are not much better.

- Traffic outside the hotel is well organized. I haven't had to wait in line for too long to hail a taxi (compared to caesar palace).
--Room layouts were awesome. Spacious, clean, and comfortable. Yes, still super spacious even with a king bed. Great feng shui. Has a higher-end lux feel to it.
- Paying resort fees sucks! but at least wifi is free and fast, and there's actually a good assortment of channels to watch and not re-runing hotel advertisements.
- Windows don't open but there's a tab you can push to get fresh air! YESS
- Lots of storage compartments. 
- Elevators are fast!
- Service is great. Everyone was courteous (even the house keepers and maintenance staff was happy to address your presence)


CONS:
- The wait to check-in at front desk is horrendous. Line is long and can take a while even if there's a lot of ppl at the front desk.
- Bell desk can be long at times too if you're trying to just check in your luggage.
- Closing doors are loud. You can hear the doors being closed from next door or across the hall. At one point I had to yell ""who is it"" because I thought someone was knocking on the door.
- You can hear neighbors pulling their curtains up\/down.
- Shower head pressure sucks. 
- No toothbrush, toothpaste, combs, etc. Just small bottles of mgm branded shampoo, conditioner, body gel, soap bar, and qtips are provided. Quality of supplies is mediocre, the cheaper $1 suave brand does a better job than this.
- Key card can be a little wonky sometimes. Had to get new key cards after check-in cause our first set didn't work.

Zero stars!

We arrived late on Wednesday night 07\/24 around 11pm or so.  We were told there are no non smoking rooms left, and despite booking one it is merely a request. This is supposed to be the hotel with the most rooms in Vegas. After getting upset, the guy spoke to his manager and miraculously ""found"" a room.

Upon entering the room - it smelled... It was bad. The carpet was filthy... So much so that when my son took off his shoes his socks turned black.  The comforter on one of the beds had stains on it. 

At this point, rather than complain, I figured I would just make do. It's late and it will get better right? So I simply remove the comforter cause I generally don't use it anyway. 

The next morning when I wake up, there is something uncomfortable under my sheets bothering my back... What is it? A large bottle cap, in between the sheets and the mattress. So does that mean the sheets were not removed when the last guest stayed here?

Thursday, we left the room early in the am around 10am  Or so and  returned around 3 pm. The room was not cleaned yet, so we left. They had almost 6 hours to do so, and it wasn't done? Well it's a big hotel, I can get over it. We came back around 6, and it was finally done. Once it was finally done, guess what? The comforter was still there! Big surprise. So again, I just kicked it to the floor. 
On Friday, we returned again around 3 or so and it wasnt cleaned. When housekeeping came, we sat in the room while they cleaned the room and even tipped her $5.00. I didn't even bother pointing out the comforter since I won't use it, I just asked for 1 extra towel. 
Again, I usually don't complain. But I did watch her change the sheets. 
 
Friday night, we went to bed around 11. The connecting room next door was making a horrible amount of noise at midnight. Shouting, laughing, music. Me, my wife, and my kids could not sleep. We called the front desk and they took care of it. It started again around 2 am. I called again. And again they said they would take care of it. 
It is a little after 4 am now - and guess what? They are doing it again. I call once again and  am assured it will be dealt with. Of course, we have not slept all night. And the woman on the phone offers us a food credit for our inconvenience. 

Are you kidding me?

We come to Vegas 4 times a year, literally. We have stayed all over the strip. We are also a family that travels a lot.
Weekend trips, long vacations. So we know hotels. And honestly, we haven't had an experience like this bad before. 

The funny thing is, I've been to this hotel
Many times before to eat,
Because it houses some of the finest restaurants   in town. And I assumed that since that is the case, the hotel
Itself must be pretty amazing. L'altilier, Robuchon, and Craft Steak are 3 of my favorite restaurants  in Vegas. I've eaten at each place multiple times. These restaurants are simply too good for this place. 

This hotel  is  horrible. And the worst part, No one cares. 

I check out in a few hours, and I will definitely complain. 

5am now and the guys next door are banging on something. I have come downstairs to complain to a manger - cause clearly calling 3 times doesn't work. There is no one here, and the guy went back to get his manager... It's been almost 10 minutes. 

Do yourself a favor, don't stay here. I know I won't be returning.


So last night, the night manager Cesar promised to comp the night that I had the problem with the unruly neighbors. This morning I go to the front desk to double check... And guess what, not only did they not do it, but allegedly they can't because I prepaid through a convention group I came with. All they can do is offer me a free upgrade upon my next stay (no chance in hell that will happen). They have to go through all the convention attendees accounts, all 6,000 of them, before they can offer a credit to the convention group who will then credit me. BS. Absolute crap. The day shift manager told me,  don't store cash and we have no means of crediting your credit card.... So this casino that deals in millions of dollars a day can't give me $189.00?

Luxurious strip-view room + Flamin' Hot Cheetos on the floor when you check in that are not yours: Not so great. 

Moral: Two greats do not always equal double great, and in this case, really soured our stay. 

When we checked into the room we found trash (and Cheetos) on the floor, hair on the ground in the bathroom, stained towels, and a TV that didn't work. It's really a shame that one careless housekeeper can make such a bad impression on you for the whole stay, but that's how it goes. 

I really love MGM resorts, and I really wanted to like the MGM Grand, but this stay really made it hard for me. If I wanted to use a bathroom with someone else's nasty hair all over the floor, I'd have gone to a gas station, thanks.

The next day the manager of the hotel apologized and comped us for a buffett which was worth over $200... They took ownership of the mess up and made me feel like I counted for something... That is an awesome thing in a hotel so large. I would come back, would recommend the MGM as well.

The only thing I don't like is it is a bit far from the middle of the strip, but we got a great workout with all the walking.",1,1,1

The room was nice and clean. The cleaning staff were all very nice. Some of the staff at check in were a bit snooty. The drink girls that work at the pool all seemed aged and out dated.

MY husband and I went to Vegas this past week to celebrate our belated honeymoon. From the time we checked into the hotel and throughout the week the service was top notch. I know some of the reviews talk about terrible experiences which would make any traveler weary but we got lucky. It is at the very beginning of the strip so it's a long walk when exploring the entire strip but as it was our first time in Vegas together we wanted to do it all. The pool was great, I liked how he lazy river didn't open until 10:00am making it bearable to get up and get a spot at a decent time. 

The first day we got a daybed for a pretty good price and received great service from Shell. We went back again the second day and again had a great time. The one thing that was a major pain was the cable in the rooms. It continually cut out, who watches TV in Vegas you may ask? We watched TV while recovering from the sun and getting ready for the night and also watched the first World Cup game making it crazy annoying at the most inconvenient of times. We don't have cable at home so it really wasn't the end of the world.

The bulk of the crew were staying at the Flamingo with a group rate but my roomie and I managed to stumble across amazing deals at the MGM that completely won us over. $69\/night for a double occupancy room (for two of the four nights)? That's better than I can get in my hometown.

The rooms were impeccably clean, offered enough furniture for us to feel like home rather than just two beds and a television, and staff seemed to be at our beck and call. You know, including the night that we ended up back in the room at 5am after a theme party, me with fake eyelashes now gluing one of my eyes shut (we were eighties glam rockers, for the record) and we decided that ordering a pizza would be a GREAT idea. The lady who brought the food up laid water on our bedside tables and seemed quite genuinely interested in our tales of debauchery from the night.

Actually, we ordered that pizza using their iPhone app as we walked down the strip and they were more than happy to accommodate us despite not being in ideal conditions to be on the phone talking to anyone.

Oh - and while I don't completely love the poor lions cooped up in their habitat, it was HILARIOUS when we walked by during a time that they weren't in their pen to see that the MGM has average joe's pop into the habitat and pretend to be lion's in their absence. Amazing.

My husband and I went hotel\/Casino hopping and stayed at MGM for our stay. Holy Moly. Where to start? I LOVE the lazy river pool [which is just one of 5] where they let you rent a $16 tube for the day which is slightly retarded, OR let you just swim around which is what we decided to do. It was great!

All the restaurants and shops are really cool too in the hotel! 

Our room was a king suite on the 4th floor in the west tower. It was truly super beautiful and we felt so comfortable! It was very clean and well put together. My only complaint is we went to gordon ramseys steakhouse and had some [expensive] leftovers, but they charged you to store food in their fridge!!! That ticked me off a little bit, but I got over it.

When we walked in and checked into our room, we literally got handed a map of the hotel so we could find our way around. Definitely helped to study that thing! I think my husband walked the wrong way everytime we tried to walk up to our room or going in and out of the elevators. This hotel is HUGE. 

We gambled the most here, the casino was amazing. We played slots and tables. We interacted with one black jack dealer in particular, I believe his name was Mark from PA and he was SO patient with me as I was learning the game, as well as the rest of the table!
This hotel was in a great location where you could easily access NYNY and some other popular hotels, however was quite a walk from the other end of the strip, but thats fine if you don't mind walking! [we loved it]!! And it is also one of the closest to the airport which was super convenient as well!

Highly recommend it. I promise we will be going back soon and deff staying here! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!

I went this past weekend for a special yelp themed Spring Break event. The instant I arrived at the hotel I was was received and treated extremely well. I asked for an upgrade at the registration desk and the person who was checking me, told me she would talk to her manager. The manager came out, properly introduced herself and told me we had several upgrades available, the first one they tried to offer was their recently renovated suites, which she showed me images of in their catalog. I almost took it, but then inquired about the other suite - the properly named Celebrity Suite. The Celebrity suite was about 650 square feet, has a hot tub and a king sized bed with an awesome view overlooking the Vegas strip. She sold me at hot tub. They even were nice enough to waive my resort fee, since I was not planning to use the wi-fi or use other services.

When I entered the room I was in love, it was everything they mentioned and so much more as visions of hot tub parties danced in my head. For the two days me and my buddy ED A stayed at the hotel, we were treated like royalty as each day we were given bottles of champagne and given awesome thank you cards.

The hotel boasts also several pools, with Wet Republic being the most popular. The pool I must say was an awesome experience as well, with several spectacular views and the djs spinning classic club bangers. 

Finally the staff was great from the receptionist, to the manager, the cleaning people and the Parking attendant, who assisted me greatly when I couldnt find my parking ticket.

Great conference, but the MGM was just Ehhh, compared to Seattle and Washington D.C. where the previous 2 conferences have been.

It was cool seeing the Keynote speeches in the same arena that the big fights were that could hold 10,000 people.

The food was so fantastic at the other two places, the very mediocre meals were a little disappointing. For breakfast it was always a breakfast sandwich with egg and a protein and fresh fruit. Cereal and yogurt and stuff too, but I just wanted the vat of scrambled eggs I could take a nice couple of scoops of. Their beer was either Bud, Bud Light, or Heineken. Nothing really too special. They did have a special craft beer on the first night, but it was kind of gross I thought, and I like Pale Ales. For lunch it was more just normal buffet stuff. I realize that feeding 10,000 people is tough, but knowing what other places have done makes me greedy. How about a guy carving roast beef at the end of each lunch line? Anything special. This was just ""Food"" I have been to a ton of places that have had a lot better mass produced food.

They get you with a lot of nickel and dime stuff. Be prepared to spend an extra $45 every night for taxes and ""Resort Fees"" which is basically, free wi-fi. The pools were all closed. Pretty lame. Actually, VERY LAME! $25 for Wi-Fi?!?

I paid $189 for a room. It was like a cruise cabin room. Super small. Plus I was looking out over the HVAC system. Not good times. I was hardly in there more than 8 hours to sleep, but it was CRAZY small. Especially for that price. For $25 dollars a night resort fee, how about taking a week's worth of resort fees and throwing a mini fridge in each room? Nope, if you want a fridge, $25 a night. What a rip off.

The place is huge though. You get lost often and it would be nice if there were a ton more maps around the place. You could spend ten minutes walking around just trying to get back out to The Strip.

The service there was great though. Super nice people.

The service is a mixed bag for me depending on the busiest environment inside MGM Grand. So far, I have no issues or complaints at all as I enjoyed playing slot machines during the whole night and requesting drinks for the server.

I haven't gotta chance to stay at MGM Grand during the Las Vegas Labor Day weekend trip, so I'll deciding and planning to stay there in the future visits and reservations.

The check in routine here really lays the foundation of how poor or excellent your stay will be.. 

Our check-in went rather well for us this time around and the woman who helped was very efficient and made sure we had everything we needed. We had found a great deal through M LIfe and got a king suite for a great rate. Most likely because February 7-10 is somehwere in between holidays and not a whole lot going on. Anywho, the room was great,exactly what we had reserved. Not a bad view even from the 8th floor and the spa tub and shower were great. The room was truly an escape from the madness.. and we needed it after two nights of going hard at pub crawls, dinners and gambling.. ah what a life. Sheesh I sound like a prick.

INTRODUCTION
When traveling to Sin City, what do you expect? Fun with friends or that special someone at the tables? A romantic dinner in a great atmosphere? Leaving your uniform at home and getting a tad loco? Well then read on. I hope these notes will help you decide whether a stay at the MGM Grand is worthy of your travel dollars.
As with any review, take it with a grain of salt as EVERYONE on this earth is different, coming to town for different reasons and what you like may not be what I'm into. If you want to wake up in your vomit and not remember what happened last night, this review may not be for you. For me, I usually come to Vegas with someone that LOVES being here -- the city lights at night, the singing of the slots and walking through the amazing lobbies or taking in shows. I'm more detail oriented and like to focus on comfort, services and a nice meal experience.
GETTING THERE
Coming from Southern California, this first thing I hope for is good traffic and we left this time mid-afternoon Saturday. Normally, we take off early to mid-morning to pass through the desert part of the trip BEFORE the desert heats up. Traffic is usually the tangible and this trip (November 10, 2012) was very light and we breezed through. Usually more cars are physically on the freeway with you, so this was nice. It is a holiday weekend which made me think there would be more folks out. NICE.
PARKING\/CHECK-IN
I injured my toe a week ago and getting from the parking lot to the main lobby is a hike. Unless you luck up and catch someone exiting new the elevators\/escalators, plan on bringing comfortable walking shows and getting your walking exercise in.
SPECIAL\/CONCIERGE SERVICES
My wife has a birthday this weekend and I'm hoping that I can plan a surprise for her special day. I got up early today and stopped down at the front desk for help. Too early for the Concierge (opens at 7am at the front desk and on the phone at 6:30am), the check-in staff was very helpful stating they may be able to do something special (heart shaped flowers on the bed, customized room service - a cake, etc). Depending on the cost, a good option. NICE.
Last weekend I was at the Hyatt Regency Jacksonville Riverfront and they did not offer free internet service. Hotels have gone back and forth on this, but in Las Vegas this should be part of the Vegas experience. The MGM Grand offers Internet service bundled into your resort fee but I love being able to jump on, check mail or listen to or watch a stream without having to pay for the basics. EXCELLENT.
ROOMS\/GROUNDS
Rooms are modern, spacious and have some niceties of note. Trendy wallpaper everywhere, sexy lighting and interesting lobbies make for a good visual. Being a first-gen resort\/casino, the lobby where you check-in isn't as fancy as say, the Bellagio, and this visit has a boxing ring for the Manny Pacquiao's fourth fight with Juan Manuel Marquez encircling the golden lion. As you move out into and through the casino as mentioned earlier, the upgrades are present. 
Bathrooms a very bright and follow the trend of not having a fan circulate\/clean to air but the semi-separate water closet, art on the walls, faux-marble suggest hip. Automated curtains are an entertainment point for the kids and climate controls are easy to operate. 
On the down side, I couldn't find the TV station listing (shouldn't have to channel surf to find what is where), more information on the concierge options should be listed on the website (self-service can drive more business) and the doors boom like live shells exploding if you don't handle with care. I'll test again as it may have been drunken gambler slamming their doors. OKAY to NICE.
FOOD
I don't really dig Las Vegas, so I look forward to a great meal or show each visit and the Top Chef celebrity Chef Tom Colicchio has a soup\/sandwich and steak sit-down joints, two Asian (one Chinese, one Japanese) and other fine dining (translates into expensive) restaurants on resort grounds. You can offset that the fancy, upscale stuff with a food court with a Nathan's, McDonald's, Chinese, and Italian (pizza slices). I'd suggest heading away from the strip for all but the special occasion meal as everything inside, although convenient at 2am, is overpriced.",0,0,0

Pros:
*HUGE Hotel-easy to meet people
*Room was nice aesthetically and bed was comfy (I stayed in a grand queen on the 17th floor)
* Housekeeping is quite thorough. Always stocked towels and tucked the [--] out of my bedsheets everyday.
*LOTS of food options on the property
*The convenience store near the elevators was a LIFE SAVER
*I arrived on Tuesday July 2 around 7pm at the hotel. Check-in was a breeze and I appreciated the courteous employee that checked us in.
*Huge parking garage. Almost too big. But my buddy rented a car and we found parking pretty easy each day (Something I learned today--ALL the hotels on the strip do free valet,regardless if you stay at that hotel or not. Would have been nice to know this before my trip lol)
* There is a walgreens,7-11, and small food court with a Subway,Sbarro,Wendy's,Del Taco and DQ less than 1\/4 mile from the hotel. I ate at subway most of the week but the Walgreens has a nice selections of sandwiches and salads too. I was able to buy a gallon of water for $2 @ the walgreens and lugged it back to my room.



Cons:
*Huge Hotel. Takes FOREVER to walk through. my friend and I were finally able to speedwalk through it at about 7 minutes after a couple days lol
* I didn't like the water pressure in my shower. Didn't have a hard stream.
*My room would get warm in the middle of the night,which made me uncomfortable and hard to sleep.
*Ice machine on my floor was out the majority of my stay (I was there July2-6)
*I knwo that i went for a holiday weekend and it waould be busy because of that but it was also UFC Fight week and I think some kind of dance competition was there. Kids and stage moms...EVERYWHERE. I'm a single 25 year old with no kids...on purpose. If i wante dto be around kids,I'd have some. (No that has nothing to do with the hotel,but I'm just saying)
*Far down the strip from the center. Not a crazy far walk,just not the most convenient when its blazing like hades outside.
*DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING YOU DO NOT PLAN ON BUYING! I was so gracious that the employee that checked us intold us that there is a $50 restocking fee if you pick something up and don't use it. (It has sensors and there's also a sign in the room) Fortunately we didn't pick up anything available in the room (never used the mini fridge or the water\/nuts) but that mark-up is INSANE.


Overall,I wanted to stay somewhere where I could meet other people my age and relax. I enjoyed the casino (I'm no gambler but the Michael Jackson slot game was my BFF by the end of the week!!) Unfortunately,it was too hot to be day buzzed (day or night really) but I'm glad I tried the MGM. I'll probably try another hotel on my next visit but I'd stay here again. There was so much I didn't get to experience (Wet republic,Hakkasan nightclub and I never ate at any of the restaurants on property.) So I'll be back. Eventually",6,0,0

I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.

I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.

That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes\/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed. 

So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.",0,0,1

Pluses:
-Central location with easy access to the tram and the monorail.
-Reasonably priced
-Fabulous restaurants:  
    Shibuya, which is a wonderful Japanese restaurant, designed lovely with friendly, knowledgable staff.  Consistently delicious food.
    Wolfgang Pucks for California cuisine in a comfortable setting.  Very polite, accommodating and courteous service.
-Staff at the front desk (or at least Jerry!)
-Staff in general seems to try to be helpful.
-Slot machines
-Pools

Negatives:
-Terrible table crews at the craps table.  They appear very sour,  are not engaging and gossip amongst themselves while looking disdainfully at the customers.  They seem very burnt out on their jobs and very unprofessional. I ended up gambling elsewhere even though I was staying at the MGM!  Craps is my favorite game in Vegas! I would give them no stars if there was a separate rating.
-The remodel.  For example,  excellent quality doors that were quiet were replaced with cheap,  noisy doors that slam easily.  I was awakened early every morning by slamming doors.  Seems like such a waste.
-Housekeeping can be unresponsive,  I guess it just depends who answers the phone.  Very inconsistent.
-The scent that is in the hotel smells like stale cologne.  That,  mixed with the cigarette smoke is overwhelming.",1,0,0

I don't know why anyone would stay here with all the hammering, noise, and dust. The lobby basically has nothing fun to do in it. The hotel is also on the end of the strip making it harder to get to where the action is (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Paris).  They even took away the live tigers (which were the only reason to make a trip to the MGM).

Let's hope this remodel is a complete overall of the hotel. Otherwise, I think MGM has seen its better days.

The buildings location is solid. I enjoy this end of the strip. Its not a far walk to get to other main focal points like the Bellagio or Caesars. 
The main areas of entertainment are bright and exciting, and the pool is up-kept nicely. 
But, its time for a remodel. Everything is the same, it offers no new or differentiating features to distinguish themselves from the other properties. Sure they have those poor and sad looking captive creatures are unique to the MGM, and no matter your stance on placing a large cat in the middle of the dessert, they are only entertaining for a whole 5 minutes. I do very much enjoy KA (amazing), but Wet Republic and the CSI attractions were decent. Go elsewhere for entertainment and exciting things to do.
My room was deplorable. I understand people go to Vegas and do stupid things in their hotel rooms, but I don't want my ""freshly cleaned room"" to still smell like a reefers college dorm. But worse, upon complaint the guest services would only put an ozone machine to try to help offset the horrible smell and denied my room change request.

Within the last month I stayed there twice.  Both times the rooms were the same layout, but in different wings. One room face the New York, New York hotel, while the other faced the roof of the lobby.  The room was clean and tidy.  Although the next morning I sat on the ledge by the window to get some sun and it was very dusty. My leggings picked all the dust up.  On the way up to the hotel there's a little shop filled with overprice goodies.  They have cupcakes that are $4 during the day, but at the end of the day the price drops to $2.  I had to have a cupcake, especially because it was half off.  I must say the turtle cupcake was very good.  

The decision of what to eat may be a tough one to make.  Whether you want fine dining or McDonald's, there are many choices for food there. More than any other hotel I've been to.  I had pizza from Perfect Pie which is a great tasting pizza place.

There are several lounges as well that are located all over the hotel.  I have yet to go to any, but when I walk by, the music is bumpin' and the people look like they're having a good time.  

In the summer months, the pool is open.  There are 3 wade pools I believe, then there's the lazy river.  Every time I have been to the river, there's always a party.  Tube rental are a bit pricey, but the price drops after a certain time.  Sometimes you may be lucky and either someone leaving will give theirs to you, or y

The person in the room above me, fell asleep w\/ the bathtub running.

We loved the new modern decoration of the hotel room, and nice king bed. But if you look closely everything was kind of cheaply made. But since we didn't pay the premium price for this room, we didn't have any complain on the room itself.
The biggest problem we had this past weekend stay was the odor smell. We could tell the section we stayed at (West Wing Tower, 4-515) is newer than the rest of the tower, looks like an extension. Once we stepped into West Wing (you could tell the carpet and wall all changed all of the sudden) we could smell strong air fresheners\/deodorizer. We didn't like it, but we didn't know why. Until we got into the room, the toilet smells like sewer, I was certain it was some sort of plumbing problem caused the strong odor, and that explains why they used strong air freshener to deodorize the entire hall way. I used to live in an apartment like that, not until they fix the major plumbing problem underneath the building, the toilet will smell like that for a long time.
On top of that, TV in the bathroom wasn't working, express check out wasn't working, and Wifi internet was down for the second night of the stay, even though we were all forced to pay $25 resort fee, but couldn't use internet, I would love to see them refund us that money.
Lastly, we were supposed to have a $75 dining credit post into our room. Since the express check out wasn't working, and after this bad experience I just couldn't trust their management, so I went down to lobby to check out in person, sure enough, they did not post that $75 credit and tried to charge onto my credit card. Glad I did check out in person otherwise it would be another hour long phone calls to get that money back once I get home...

After reading the hotel representatives reply I also feel compelled to let everyone know that we were charged an additional $40 per child that we brought with us traveling... We had a total if you were in our party including my husband and myself and received no more than two bath towels. I think Lori is missing the whole issue and my point is you don't stay at a nice hotel on the Las Vegas strip and expect to need to send an email before getting any customer service assistance. 

Receiving a minimum of one bathing towel per hotel guest is the bare-bones minimum one should expect even at a low budget hotel.

The lions on display (check for times before you swing by).

Crappy customer service, order somethng specific from the front desk\/concierge and they dont follow through.
To expensive for the quality of the rooms.

The MGM expects a lot of their customers to be drawn in by their reputation (take a hint from Toyota, you have to keep that reputation by backing it up with what got you it in the first place).  The rest to be drawn in by the big giant lion out front.  It just wasn't enjoyable enough for me to ever desire to come back.

My friend's family lives in Vegas and they got a comped room for a weekend, which we used for my friend's bachelorette party. (Soooo much fun :)  

Pros:
- free room 
- really comfy beds
- clean, big, marble bathrooms
- rooms were quiet - we didn't hear the neighbors at all 
- good dining choices - I've eaten at Shibuya and Wolfgang Puck, which is a great value for the quality of food
- huge pool with lots of options - it's just far from the rooms, be sure to pack everything with you. Didn't have a chance to check out Wet Republic, but it definitely seemed like a see-and-be-seen day party. 
- has a stop on the monorail, which we didn't use, but seems like a good idea.

Entrees:
I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which was really good and extremely spicy. I was told that the spiciness was a bit hotter than normal, but I loved it. So, if it comes out not too spicy, I would ask for them to get you additional sauce to spice it up a bit more.

I tried the steak and eggs, which are basic steak and eggs. Nothing really special here, but it's good. I also tried this beef rib item, which was very good as well.

Pancakes are made with great quality and are tasty. Not the best I have ever had, but they are good.

Typically when I come to Vegas, which is at least once or twice a month, I stay at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. I've recently decided to expand my horizons and begin trying out different hotels each time I visit. So I started with the MGM Grand.

This particular trip happened to be a 2 year anniversary getaway for my girlfriend and I. After the short but always dreaded drive from Southern California, we arrived at the MGM. We opted to self park in the garage where finding a parking space was a breeze (to be expected mid-week). We made our way from the garage to the Lobby. After a short 5 minute wait in line, we were beckoned to the Check-In desk. As I handed over my credit card and I.D. I inquired about paying for a room upgrade. The lady at the desk said they were sold out and no upgrades were available.. No big deal.  She then proceeded to make a call to check to see if our room was cleaned and ready. After a 20 minute long wait (not exaggerated) she was finally able to confirm our room was ready and checked us in. We made our way to the West Grand Tower and proceeded to the 20th floor where our room was located. As we approached our room, the door was ajar and housekeeping was STILL cleaning our room, even though the front desk confirmed that our room was ready.. We sat in the hallway and waited for another 20 min (still not exaggerated) while they cleaned our room. After 40 minutes, we were FINALLY able to get into our room. (Longest check-In process I've ever experienced). 

The room was very well cleaned and in fairly good shape, This specific room appears to be renovated within the past 5 years.

Pros:
Clean and Well Kept
Large Windows\/ Good Lighting
Large Spacious Floor plan

Comfy Sectional Couch w\/ Chaise Lounge

As I'm writing this review I'm finding it hard to write a list of negatives about this hotel. If you are looking for a large no frills room\/hotel for your Vegas getaway and base your experience on only the accommodations then this is the place for you. 

Coming from a marketing background, I've always been a firm believer that customer service is they key to building customer\/client loyalty. If people aren't satisfied with their service, they will go elsewhere.

With that being said, I cant say that I will return to the MGM in the future except to gamble or hit up Hakkasan but I would not recommend this hotel to my friends, family or colleagues simply due to the fact of the poor customer service that I experience during my stay.",1,0,0

My last stay was decent but nothing spectacular. I booked the Petite King, which is one of the newer rooms in the West Tower. It was just a room for me and my boyfriend so we didn't need anything big. 

After the crazy long drive to Vegas, we went to the concierge to get our room. The woman at the front desk was polite and drew out a map on how to get to our room even though I had mentioned I stayed there before. We finally managed to get on our way to our room with our luggage and got to the West Tower elevators. Our room was booked for the 14th floor, and after numerous frustrating attempts with our heavy carry on bags and ice chest to press ""14"" in various elevators, it just would not take us there. After asking someone for help, he explained that the 14th floor was under construction. Well thank you for mentioning that to us. He directed us to the staff elevator that we could use, but also conveniently forgetting to tell us to get off at the 12th floor and walk up the flight of stairs to the 14th floor. A construction worker directed us back to the elevator and told us to go back down. Um, okay. At this point, frustration levels between my boyfriend and I were so high that I was sure our entire weekend was ruined. 

After getting on and off so many different elevators, I cant even remember how we got  to our room. When we finally did, which took about 30 minutes, the front desk called and asked if we got to our room okay. Luckily my boyfriend took the phone because I was about to scream my head off. 

I think the worst part of it though was that the room doesn't really have a ""bathroom"". It's pretty much just sectioned off to the side when you first enter and the toilet and shower are behind separate glass doors, which is incredibly deceptive if you look at their website. So if you decide to come here on a romantic getaway with your honey and book their Petite King, you better be comfortable enough to hear each other do things on the toilet because it will echo loudly even though the TV volume is up high. Or secretly hope that your honey goes to sleep before you do so you can use the bathroom.",2,2,1

The biggest complaint I've ever run into is that the length of the hallways is ridiculous. That may not sound like a big deal, but it can be given the size of the overall property. The property size is a plus in my book because it makes the place all inclusive in a lot of ways. If you're up early or late at night, there's always something open for you to eat or drink. 

The rooms have always been in great shape during my visits. Room service has always been timely and I've never experienced any issues with the staff. One thing I like about the room is the black out curtains. They come in very handy if you're working or partying on a weird schedule.

We stayed in the grand tower executive queen suite. Great room for our family. 2 queens and a pull out sofa. It was Big enough to be accommodate. 

Pool is a little far from the rooms. You have to walk through the stores and restaurants but our kids didn't mind. Get to the pool early to snatch some chairs!! It was great cause every time we went, it was all families. Then come around 1-2pm is when the mature adults came out. That's when we left which was perfect from being there 9am-1pm. 

My only complaint about the hotel is the AC in our rooms. Being in Vegas, you would assume the ac would be amazing and full blast!! Unfortunately the lowest it went was to 67 degrees and the blow of it did not cool our room as we'd like. Then, we figured out that there's Lil vents near the window that lets hot air in. Why? !!

Not from being up all night or from a hangover, but from the construction noise. Construction noise directly overhead from 9am to 3pm is terrible. I'm on vacation, in Vegas; I wanted to sleep past 9am. The power was out one night. On Wednesday we didn't have water to our room from 11am-4pm. Please believe nothing was discounted or comped. 

We booked the room directly through the hotel because my husband wanted to make sure that we got a non-smoking room. When we arrived in Vegas at 3pm we were assigned to a smoking room. No go. Then we were told that another room was not going to be available to us for several hours and were given a phone number to call later to check on it. Several hours later we were in a room. It is a very standard\/basic room. No fridge, minibar,  or coffee maker. The TV is an old hulking thing. The bed is very comfortable though (although it doesn't help much when you can't sleep for the noise.) The shower head could definitely be replaced.

The casino is very large with a lot of options. You have to walk through a mall area to get to the pool (unless there is some secret, convenient passageway I couldn't find). I stayed at Mandalay Bay last time I was in town, and while more expensive, it was definitely more comfortable and enjoyable. The staff was much nicer, too. The one good thing about MGM is that it is central to a lot of the other hotels and casinos, so I was able to spend most of my time at NYNY, which I liked much better. 

Also, the lions are gone, so don't waste your time coming to look for them. 

There really isn't much here that has made up for the noise and irritation, and I will definitely book elsewhere next time I'm in Vegas.",5,0,0

When my girls and I were out and about, we asked the housekeeping staff to clean our room. When we get arrive back to our ""clean room,"" I expected that the used crunched up kleenex  should have been taken out because I already mentioned about the incident to the front desk from previous night that we checked in.  When I opened the drawer where the used kleenex, there it was staring at me.  LOL I am not touching that used kleenex because I am fully aware of VRE and MRSA ( you know what I am implying if you are working a healthcare field LOL).  Surprisingly, the housekeeping did not AGAIN spot the dirty kleenex in the bedside table drawers. Anyways, I took 1 star off because of housekeeping. Overall, I enjoyed the stay. Espicially, the Hakassan nightclub bouncers and security staff were friendly because they do look after their guest. I am very thankful for their help! We will be back again.

Had a great room with a great view, the concierge service was really accommodating and helpful, and oddly enough, one of the best parts was being able to check in at the airport! I had read about this option, but assumed it would be some kind of kiosk, etc. But they have a whole pseudo-hotel front right at the baggage claim. You walk in, they greet you, check you in, give you your KEYS and then you head to the hotel and walk straight to the elevators. Grand, indeed!

They also have a great selection of upscale restaurants (CraftSteak was my personal favorite) and more casual ones for during the day. I was able to experience the spa, but I REALLY wanted to chill out in the lazy river, but ended up being too busy.

My main complaint is kind of random, but... I hated the in-room toiletries. The lotion and shower gel smelled like a lumberjack's deodorant!

The hotel has an energetic,  young vibe as the resident dj's there are well known edm dj's like Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Hardwell, etc. The Hakkasan club is definitely the party spot.

When we planned our trip to Vegas, i was delighted to find out that my mom had booked a couple rooms at MGM Grand, the delight was not for long. So, we get to the Hotel, and the bell boy\/girl, came to pick up our luggage, as soon as he put our luggage on the cart he ASKED for a tip?!?! He said he DOESN'T share it with the people that accompany him. So, we gave him his tip and went to the front desk. We had requested EARLY check in, and were disappointed with the fact that our rooms WERE NOT ready, so we had to go somewhere else to kill time, until regular check in time. There goes the extra money they could have made. They said they would call us back if our rooms were ready by 1:00pm. There was no call so we went back to the hotel at 2:00pm, and were informed that the rooms were STILL NOT ready, and DOWNGRADED us, rather upgrading for the inconvenience. So we agreed to it and got our rooms. Another bell boy came to drop off our stuff to the room and AGAIN asked for a tip. We handed him 3$ but he refused saying, ""the bell desk, does not take any tip under 5$"". Well too bad for him, we decided not to tip him. We then got a call from the hotel half hour later, and we were informed that our rooms were ready. They didn't even know we had already checked in. WHAT GREAT MANAGEMENT! Still, no apologies. The rooms on the other hand were really nice, which the reason for me giving 3 stars. We had a great time in Vegas, the valet services were great, they did NOT ask for tips. The day we checked out, we called for the bell desk once again and a lady came to pick up our belongings, and AGAIN, we were asked for a tip, and that she wouldn't share it with the people that deliver it to our car. We told her we wouldn't tip her until she took our stuff downstairs, and she complied. She brought our stuff downstairs, and we tipped her and the valet, and left Vegas.

If you're a tourist, you'll find that Vegas is like China.  Both try to suck money from you at every turn, except Vegas tries to be more *civilized* by masking the sucking in the form of resort fees, taxes, tips, high-priced drink and food.  Add to this the fact that I have as much interest in gambling as have in a threesome with one male orangutang and a pink bowling ball and you'll understand my frame of mind when I'm in Vegas.  Unfortunately, despite my feelings about this place, I've had to visit Vegas every year in January for business for the last 8 years.  

The MGM Grand Hotel is a monstrosity of shiny green glass on the North end of the Vegas Strip.  It's shaped like a pile of staggered Lego bricks, and when you're inside the hotel, you'll sometimes wish the bricks will just cave the hell in on you.

Like all hotels on the Strip, you're allowed to smoke in almost all public areas, so the ventilation system blows in this fake bathroom\/car scent smell which pervades the entire hotel.  We'd booked rooms directly with the hotel, believing that we'd get better rooms, but when we arrived at 7pm, we had to wait 10 minutes while our clerk checked with the Manager about getting our Premium King View Room.  The room does have a magnificent view, but at a cost - our heater was completely broken...meaning that, while Vegas was experiencing its worst freeze outside (about 27 overnight), we were experiencing what it was like to be in the Saharan desert in August.  Our thermostat was broken and temps reached the 80s overnight.  

Our lovely Samsung TV, which my boyfriend dared venture to watch one night for a few hours, suddenly shorted out in the middle of a program, then just as suddenly came blasting on a few hours later at about 1am.

Next, the mini fridge was packed with stuff (you had to pay through the nose for), and there was even a sign which stated that you couldn't put your own crap inside and take theirs out, or else there'd be a $50 re-stocking fee.  If that wasn't bad enough, none of our shampoos or lotions were refilled or replaced after they were used.  All this makes me feel that the MGM would try to charge us for the air we breathe, if they could.

The hotel does have some good.  The room we got is spacious and quiet, the bed comfortable.  There are a few pretty decent restaurants, such as Nobhill, Wolfgang Puck Express, and one of the Cirques is playing here.  Was impressed by the check in counters available for select airlines, as well as the kiosks where you can print out your boarding passes.  (You can check your luggage via the hotel for $10\/bag fee.)  Upon check out, we were comped about $28.00 for the ghost in the TV.  (This was after my boyfriend tried to get a comp over the phone but couldn't get one.  And, when he gave up all hope of getting a comp, the check out clerk gave him one.)

Their night club Hakkasan was so fun - of course, if you're a guy, you have to pay a $50 cover, which is obscene but we talked to a promoter and so our group of 11 ladies got in for free to see Zedd deejay.

My experience at this hotel was overall a really good one. When we arrived there was barely a line for check in. I like that this hotel has a single line for each check in agent at the counter. It's not one single line that wraps around the lobby, its multiple lines. Upon checking in the check in agent was very kind and helpful. She answered all our questions and explained all the information we needed to know for checking in. The whole check in process at the counter was under 7 minutes. Which is pretty decent compared to other Hotels in Las Vegas that I have stayed at.

Our room was on the 16th floor and faced the New York\/Excalibur and Tropicana hotel and street. The view was of just the south strip and also of the casino roof of the MGM. The room was clean. The bathroom was clean. The only issue I have with the room was one of the electrical plugs did not work, which I didn't know until after having my phone plugged into it for an hour and then realizing it wasn't charging.  My friend's only gripe was there was no coffee maker in the room. But other than that the room was nice. It was just a regular room so therefore it wasn't spectacular but it was nice for a Vegas room.  

The breakfast buffet was DELICIOUS!! My friend and I are both early birds so we were up early to catch the buffet. It is definitely worth going to.  The Zuri Bar is really nice. It kind of reminds me of a carousel the way it looks from the casino. The only problem about that bar is that the music inside the bar seating area is house music and strange ( at least when we were there, that was the type of music they were playing). 

Our check out process was simple and quick. We were out of there within 10 mins. It was extremely crowded that day being that there was a Pacquiao fight there that night but we checked out quick.

However, being a guest  here is quite the opposite. They gave away our two rooms, which were supposed to have 2 beds in there. It was 3 girls per room. They wouldn't give us a roll away bed because of a fire hazard since the room was so tiny (west wing). One of the girls called to complain so we were comped 2 more rooms. That helped, but it's a pain to have to check in again the next day and move our stuff.

The rooms itself were your average rooms and pretty sparse. It was modern, but the TV was real old and the bathroom was very plain. I guess it was the furniture and decor that gave it the modern look, but there weren't any capital improvements.

The cabana was basically a big, canvas tent. My expectations were high since the last cabana I had was at the Wynn and it had actual walls and misters at the entrances. The heat was trapped in there nicely. Our server, Joey, was great though. We bought a bottle of Goose and had mixers with it. It came with 2 tubes too so we didn't need to rent them for $16 each. We had a great time at the pool, but it's kind of dirty with a lot of leaves floating in it. 

Their 24 hour cafe was Wolfgang and their selection is quite limited. Everything was really fru-fru on the menu. The prices were pretty high, too.

So my room was pretty nice and chic, I think they were going for a modern feel, the layout seemed a little weird at first but the room did seem very spacious. So first when I walk in the room, there's a sink and to the left there is a toilet with a door and separating that with a wall was a shower right next to it. Walking past the sink there is a wall behind it to separate it from the bed where a large TV was mounted. The bed and mattress was really comfortable, there were 2 night stands and on the one to the right was a broken, antiquated Sony iPod clock player (16-pins instead of lightning port). So all in all the room was good and the only thing was the room was showing a little but of age was the wall outlet plate was loose and the nightstand was a little dusty, but I had a nice comfortable, homey room with an air conditioning that worked (super important to beat the heat of Vegas in the summer). The wifi was adequate but sometimes I had a little bit of problems loading browsers or sending iMessages and text messages. Now that MGM charges $10\/day for parking it's important to keep your room's keycard with you because that's your way to enter and exit the self parking lot of the MGM and it gives you in-and-out privileges at the other MGM Resorts in Las Vegas (Mandalay Bay, Delano, Luxor, Excalibur, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, The Mirage, Circus Circus) as well. I think it's good that at night they have security at the lobby level of the guest elevators. My only suggestion is that I wished that they had a mini fridge in the room so I can keep my drinks cold but other than that, good stay and I'll be back!",0,0,0

Basically, it's still the same, they've updated what they've had to but what was once cutting edge is now dated.

It's sad to see that MGM Resorts or whatever they're calling themselves these days funneled so much into CityCenter and let their other properties go. 

The rooms are rooms, nothing fancy. I stayed in the main tower, so West Wing would probably have been a better fit for me. The furniture was old, the TV was not a flat panel which would have been fine because MGM actually offers up a lot of channels if the button on the TV hadn't been broken. Um no thanks MGM, I'm not sticking my finger in the TV to get it on...

I like that there's a food court, I have to say that a lot of the food I got on room service was sub par. The best thing I got were buffalo wings and I mean who gets heating those things up wrong.

I booked a complimentary  room through myVegas (facebook game that gives real Vegas prizes).  Upon arrival, I noticed the extremely long line of people waiting to check in.  This was at 6:00 pm too!  I waited for about ten to fifteen minutes until I could talk to a representative to check in.  I started to chat it up with the person that was helping me check in.  I asked him if he had any complimentary upgrades available; perhaps a larger room.  I was expecting him to say he did not have anything available because the hotel seemed so busy.  He asked me to give him a minute.  A minute passes and he tells me to hold on some more.  He leaves the desk and comes back five minutes later.  When he comes back, he tells me he has upgraded me to the a grand towers' suite room!  I was in shock that he hooked it up, because I had tried the same thing at Aria, and she shot me down rather quickly.  After that, I gave him a $20 and darted to the room.  

The room itself was all the way at the end of the 10th floor, which is good, because all the good rooms are at the end of the halls.  When I opened the doors, I was greeted with a living room with a table, couches, chairs, lamps, and a flat screen t.v.  I then opened the cellular shades with the panel on the wall, and was amazed by the fantastic view of the many hotels and casinos on the strip.  After that, I walked into the bathroom and found his and her sinks, as well as a tub, and a separate shower.  After making my way past the bathroom, I found the master bedroom.  The view was not as spectacular as from the living room though.  However, there was yet another t.v., as well as a table.  This was definitely one awesome room.  

As for the hotel itself, parts are outdated, and other areas have been remodeled.  I think it is a hit and miss regarding their rooms.  I have read horrible reviews, and others being very positive.

Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. 

LOCATION: 
More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.

EXTERIOR:
Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway\/lobby\/drop off\/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.

INTERIOR:
HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. 

SHOPPING:
Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.

We booked in here knowing full well it was a casino and would be full of party folks and we have kids, so our expectations were not high.  Our plan was to go to the pools early to avoid the crowds and have the kids back in the room right after dinner to avoid any party craziness.  

The room was average.  Beds were ok - bathroom was kind of small.  I could have booked at the Venetian for the same price and every room is a suite there, but we choose MGM for the pool.  The pools would have been great except they were literally a mile away from our room. You had to travel through the casino, through the shops and restaurants, and then through a long Lobby to the first set of pools. The sheer volume of people was staggering by 3pm. It was so packed that there were times I thought I might drown because of the wall to wall drunken folks.  We didn't go back to the pool after the first day. The other problem was the smoke. I know everywhere you can smoke and in the other hotels it didn't seem as bad but at the MGM it seemed 10x worse. The smoke was so bad and the smell so horrible that even though we were in a non-smoking room it still reeked.

My fiancee and I arrived around noon and were unable to check in.  I figured that it wasn't a problem since check in was at 3 pm.  We stored the bags with the bellman and did some sightseeing.  We came back around 4 pm, but our room was still not ready.  It didn't bother me, but the front desk agent offered a free buffet for my fiancee and I, which I thought to be a kind gesture.  Thirty minutes later, our room was ready and we headed to our room.  As in many casinos, you have to walk through the casino floor to get to the elevators.  I guess this is their way to hustle you out for more money, but it is very inconvenient to maneuver through the crowd, especially when you have luggage.  I booked ourselves into a King Bungalow Suite that included a $25 food credit, free admission to Studio 54, and free admission to the spa. The room was exactly what I've seen on their website.  There is a spacious bedroom with a separate living room area that included a sofa and a television.  Unfortunately, we had a view of the other tower, but I got past it real quick.

That night, we used our free buffet coupon for dinner at the MGM Grand Buffet.  We ate around 6 pm and waited for a good 20 minutes before we got seated (my review on the buffet is in another section of my profile).  Other than the buffet, we didn't really use any of the facilities or food and beverage outlets.  

As for the casino, it is huge and difficult to maneuver around.  There were a lot of $5 tables to choose from, which I really enjoyed.  They cater to all types of gamblers.  I really enjoyed my time playing Casino War...which I still find hilarious to play.  What will they think of next?  

Like I said earlier, this hotel is massive.  You will get lost.  If you can get past that, I highly recommend staying here; if not, I recommend you gamble here.  It's located on the south side of The Strip and is one of the stops for the monorail.

When we first arrived, we were told to call a certain number to check if our room was ready.  We did around one and the woman who answered was really rude.  We called again at two and the woman snapped at me and hung up.  I called guest services and spoke with a very sweet manager named Monique.  I explained to her what was going on, and she could not have been more apologetic.  She bought us lunch and changed the woman answering the phones, because when we called back around three, we spoke to a very pleasant woman, and our room was finally ready.  LOL.  

The room was basic, and with all the taxes, resort fees, breathing fees, etc, our room was $300 per night.  Definitely too high for such a simple room.  We didn't even have a mini bar. (Although, that may have been a blessing in disguise.)  

The casino is well laid out, and easy to navigate even after, uh hem, a few glasses of sangria at Wolfgang Puck's. They check room keys at the elevator to keep everybody safe, which I really like.  Plus, I won $400 on the slots.  The casino gets five stars. LOL.

We went to a bar called Taboo.  Free booze = yes.  The bartender on the far side close to the DJ on Friday, June first, was a complete jerk.  He glared at me when I asked to give him my credit card so I could tip him, since everything was free.  Then he bit the head off a girl who asked if she could smoke.  It was really weird.  I have never met an angry Vegas bartender until now.  The DJ was also SUPER pretentious.  He refused to take requests, had his own security, (give me a break) and only played about 20-30 seconds of each song.  We stayed until the free booze was cut off and made a break for the Rouge Lounge, which was awesome, and had great bartenders.

Now on to my favorite part.  The LAZY RIVER!!  Okay, whose idea was it to make a lazy river, inner tubes with handles, and serve me (wildly expensive, but delicious) fruity drinks?  Because I love you.  We had a blast!  It was the most fun I've had in Vegas!  Great people, clean, cool water, strong drinks, awesome music, and on and on.  

We went to the producers' pool after the lazy river closed and the security guys were such jerks!  They kept yelling at people for making out, smoking, being drunk, etc.  Um, are we in Vegas or in church?  Those guys need to chill out, or find a new job. IT'S VEGAS, for crying out loud.  Sheesh.

I was torn as to how many stars I should give.  Monique, the lazy river and Wolfgang Puck's get five, but the other staffers, the cost, and Taboo get one.  So I gave three.  I may try a different hotel next time, but this one had some good points. :)",7,6,6

In keeping with the theory that bigger is better, even the smallest guest rooms - at 446-square-feet - are spacious, with sitting areas and luxurious marble baths.

The Room:
Our stay was, well... ""A-OK"" (just like the yelp rating definition). The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean enough, and check-in was painless. For the most part, the room was a typical  hotel room, however; it lacked amenities that I expect all Vegas hotels to offer. For example, the room lacked a coffee\/tea maker, mini-fridge, and microwave; guests have to pay $25 to use the fitness center; and the walls were very thin so you could hear your neighbors clearly.

If you get a good deal on a room, then I say go for it. But I wouldn't recommend the room if you have to pay the full-price weekend rate. 

The Hotel:
MGM has a lot of dining options. You can eat at a McDonald's for lunch and Emeril's for dinner. And I like that. There are also a lot of entertainment options, such as shows, the large pool area, and clubs. I really don't have any complaints about the hotel.",1,0,1

1.)  We made reservations for 3 nights and decided to add another one a little later so it came up in there system as 2 reservations - makes sense - they said this would not be a problem...lol...after our ""first reservation"" night was over apparently the room service thought we were supposed to be gone and tried to come into our room in the middle of the night, not only once, but twice....scaring the living you-know-what out of me.  Obviously communication was lacking.

2.)  When my husband went out to see who was trying to come into our room he took his key with him and found out that our keys were disconnected, meaning we needed to get new room keys.  We were told at the front desk there wouldn't be any problems with this, not the case.

3.)  When we got our new keys we were told that we wouldn't be debited another safety deposit, but when we got our bill we were debited $128 and $200...once again, not what we expected.

4.)  We came in to see the Mayweather fight and we initially booked a King bed and we believe when we booked the second reservation there were move reservations made thus we got a smaller room, thus for the entire stay we were give the smaller room despite the majority of the time was on the original booking with the bigger room.

5.)  Room was dark, small, smelled, the trendy heavy glass shower and toilet were right next to each other and was a little uncomfortable if you know what I mean...also opening and closing the doors was annoying since they were quite heavy and made a loud clanging noise when they shut.  Lighting was poor and b\/c we had the smaller room the head of our bed was against our jail size window.  Amenities were lacking, extremely slow internet, dial-up would have been faster and no coffee maker or fridge.  We don't drink but there was no mini-bar either.  I think we were supposed to be on the non-smoking floor but you could have fooled me!

6.)  So when we checked out our bill was severely incorrect, I believe I was on hold for about 45 min before we could get the bill reconciled.  Also there were these odd ""resort fees"" that we were mysteriously charged....apparently it was b\/c we would have had access to the business center, the cardio room, and to receive a USA today daily...lol...don't think I saw anyone with a USA Today.  And to be honest I am not real confident that this will be my last discussion with them.  

All in all, not an impressive place to stay, bad service, no great amenities, horrible communication, no one seemed to care about your stay, don't do it, unless you just want a place to crash after a hard night of drinking, I would say that is the only thing this place is good for.",3,1,1

Valet parking only, so be sure you get everything you need out of your car before they wisk it away to points unknown. The valets were very fast and efficient tho, and were quite accomodating when I had to request my car be brought round because I forgot a pair of shoes in the back.

Pros: Decent sized room (Grand King room). Decent sized bathroom. Rooms were clean and neat. Furniture was up-to-date. Any time we needed something, the service was punctual, helpful and polite (for the most part; I'll get to this in a second). The set up and interior of the hotel was beautiful. The pool area was nice. I know, February and we were by the pool. The weather was gorgeous during the day and the pool was warm, which I was happy about. Checkout was pretty standard. Valet was pretty organized and functional. They didn't seem all over the place. The walls between the rooms were not thin, so if there was an argument in either room next to us or a loud TV playing, or anything, we didn't hear it. For the most part, the bell service was nice and helpful.

Cons: The restaurant selections weren't as many as I thought there would be. Didn't like that room service was knocking on our door at 10:00 AM, before checkout. Wish they would've had a brochure or menu of the offerings the hotel has: What to do in the hotel, restaurants, nightlife, spa. If it was there, we didn't see it. We had a few bad experiences with different bellhops. When I arrived, I didn't have any cash on me (I know, tragic). I mean, people carry cash all the time, don't they? Anyhow, I felt bad that I didn't have any on hand and I told each bellhop I interacted with that I would place their tip at the desk when I do get cash out. Most of the time, they smiled and said that it was fine. They understood and said that the best way to do so is to put it in an envelope with their name on it. However, there was one that simply looked away and clinched his fist. Completely rude. He wasn't even polite during the entire time I interacted with him. I'm marking this up to being one bad apple in the bunch.

Finally, this is a HUGE CON. I know I said the checkout was in the pro. I was specifically talking about just calling them and that whole thing. It was quick. However, when I got my receipt, they put the deposit refund on the wrong card. Here's what happened. My wife and I, and two other family members went together. I booked two rooms under my name. I made sure their names were under the other room so they could check-in. The other two arrived at the hotel before we did and checked in first. They paid THEIR room and THEIR deposit under THEIR card. When my wife and I arrived, we paid OUR room and OUR deposit under OUR card. However, after I checked out, the deposit for BOTH rooms were put under the OTHER party's card. I had to call the hotel and spend 15 minutes resolving the issue. I don't know how they were going to refund my room's deposit on someone else's card when I originally paid the deposit for my room with my card. Just frustrating.

All in all, the experience wasn't bad. I know some people's reviews will say the rooms smelled moldy or their check-in experience was a disaster. I didn't have that experience. Of course, I didn't come during a busy weekend either. I would recommend this hotel, as out of the top hotels, it was more affordable and didn't feel it was an ""old"" hotel.",0,1,0

I thought MGM would be great as it is well established but the customer service is as bad as it could be! When we booked with expedia, we were told that we would get complimentary buffets. We confirmed with the front desk staff when we checked in and she explicitly said we (4 people) get to have buffet for free twice within the hotel and all the fees would just be waived when we check out. Thus, we stayed within the hotel for two DISGUSTING meals just to save money. When we checked out, we were charged for the buffets (they waived the fee of 2 buffets ie $80). When we inquired about it, the front desk person first accused us of lying saying we did ""mobile checkin"", which we did not even know was a thing and we also said they could check the surveillance camera for proof. Then he finally got the manager to talk to us. He was as bad of a manager as you could possibly imagine as he basically told us to suck it up and pay. This is MGM we are talking about, not some random motel! He not only was not understanding at all, he also said we just have to be responsible for our own expenses and since we bought it through expedia, they can't do anything about it, and we have to be responsible for their OWN EMPLOYEE'S MISTAKE! I am 100% sure that MGM, being a huge hotel, could BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKE! Our trip was so wonderful until this hotel ruined it for us! Go stay at another hotel!

Upon arrival, I had to wait about 45 minutes in line, which was a bit irritating, but I soon realized people watching is not a bad way to start off your first trip to Vegas. When I got to the front, I was pretty mortified to find out I would have to put down a $300 deposit on the room (I had won the trip and wasn't expecting that), but the lady was very helpful and lowered it to $200 for me. From there, it was only good things!

Our room itself was gorgeous! Really spacious, clean, and smelled just fine. I don't know what other people were complaining about. Although the outside view was of the oh-so-beautiful LV airport (-_-), we weren't there for that, so it didn't really matter. Also, most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on. And the bathroom?! Oh jeez, don't even get me started on that amazing mirror. Let's just say two girls who were planning on getting fancy quite a bit that weekend were very pleased.

The rest of the hotel was also lovely. Yes, the casino smells like cigar smoke, but what LV casino doesn't? MGM had a good selection of shops and restaurants. Really entertaining place to just walk around; might even see some celebrities like we did. Pools = Awesome! Never had trouble finding a place to sit and soak up some rays. (Although we gave up on trying to get into Wet Republic when Calvin Harris was there... food was beckoning and the line was as long as the Great Wall.)

Staff was also super helpful. Room service was friendly and gave us extras of pretty much everything we asked for. I almost missed check-out time, had a panic attack, called the front desk, and the lady took care of it for me over the phone. Awesome? Yes.

the room wasn't ready, but the lady checking me in was very nice. she was able to get me the perfect room. on the highest floor with a strip view, facing NYNY. she gave me a phone number to call in a couple hours to check if the room was ready. and we decided to walk around. about 2 hours passed and we gave them a call, and it was ready!!

we went up to our room and it was PERFECT. it was right out of the elevator, and the view was great!!

it was my birthday in a couple days, and when the receptionist found out, she sent up a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries up to my room, no charge!!

the lazy river was everything i ever dreamed of. the hot weather and a cold pool was all i ever wanted for my birthday weekend! hahaha. the room was VERY clean and the cleaning ladies stocked up on our soaps and shampoos (I'm addicted to their soap brand) 

the hotel itself feels like our home now. food court has a big variety of restaurants for a quick bite to eat. the poker table dealers are very nice with beginners. and anywhere\/everywhere you go out to the ""outside world"" there is convenience. a souvenir shop right outside the doors, m&m world, coca cola world... a bridge connecting to the NYNY, and my favorite... the monorail. for only $5 a ride or $12 for the whole day you can ride all the way to the end of the strip without hailing a taxi. and they are ALWAYS on time.

i love this hotel. seriously.",1,0,0

However, the customer service here is horrible!  I told my friends that these people are in the customer service industry and really should learn how to treat their guests.  The person at the registration desk was god awful.  She did not smile one bit, and even though we were here for a bachelorette party (which was pretty obvious since we were all wearing matching shirts and the bride to be was wearing a ridiculous feather boa), she was not accommodating at all.  We inquired about a room upgrade if possible but instead of even trying to check for us, she automatically responded with a curt NO.  Again, not even a smile or look of apology.  ::virtual slap::

Anyway, our experience doesn't get much better.  The night before we checked out called concierge to see if we could request a late check out.  They said to call back in the morning cuz they won't know then abruptly hung up on us.  Uhhh is that how you treat your guests?

First off, if you haven't gotten the Mlife card, do so, you get great rates on hotels, shows, etc. that are MGM and it's free!

The check in\/bell hop service was a breeze! Every employee was friendly and welcoming. I thought this hotel would take forever as it is one of the largest hotels in the entire US. Nope, check in and finding our room was a breeze much easier than Venetian! 

The room was decent sized definitely not a suite but for the price you couldn't beat it. The elevators were fast no long wait time. The halls and rooms didn't smell like smoke. 

However the casino part was smokey a little bit. Never had issues with anyone offering us drinks in casino part they were always coming around which is nice I feel like this isn't always the case. 

The bathroom had marble tile and everything was recently updated you could tell. Room was always spotless. If you request a strip view room you do indeed get that which is super cool - if you've never requested it do so its worth the few extra bucks. 

The location is the easiest and first from the airport which is nice but if you're walking to the other end of the strip or fashion show mall i'd suggest pay 5 bucks for an uber and save yourself an hour of walking. 

The buffet here i'll post on another review but don't waste your time or money on that. I'd suggest even going to the MGM food court which they have in the hotel among several other restaurants.

The casino is very large and some people may complain its to large and get lost in it. Well they didn't get the reputation of being one of the biggest casinos in the world for nothing.

Some don't like the pool because it is crowded and can be loud in certain areas (namely, around the lazy river). I, however, love the lively energy of the pool. The music, the people, the lazy river and flowing drinks all add up to a great day in the sun. Besides, if you really do want a quieter lounging experience, stay in the first pool to the right. The music is more mellow there (a lot of Classic Rock and Oldies) and the crowd isn't there for the party so you won't be disturbed while taking your sun-induced naps. And, if you do choose to drink, the cocktail servers are more attentive in this section since they don't have 20 drunk frat boys yelling for another round constantly.

Also, this pool is one of the best places to people watch. I have seen crazy, gross, hilarious and sad all in one day before.

Now for the rooms. The beds here are the most comfortable beds I have slept on in Vegas. They look nice too, with white comforters accented by navy blue (in most rooms). I am often times tempted to go to Vegas just to sleep all weekend in one of those beds. The standard rooms aren't anything spectacular, but those beds make up for the lack of pizazz. 

The rooms in the towers are nicer and more spacious than the rooms in the main hotel. Regardless of what room you stay in, YOU WILL GET LOST the first 5 times you try to get there. 

The MGM is massive. One of the biggest and most spread out casino\/hotel\/entertainment centers in Vegas. You can follow the signs all you want but you will still get lost. After a day or two you should get used to walking around and will only have to use the signs as a basic guide. You will know to stay to the left of such and such restaurant to get to the side of the casino that leads to the pool. You will know that if you can find the ""walk"" then you can find the pool and the chain restaurants. So on and so on. The most difficult part of navigating the MGM is realizing that despite the MGM's strip location, their lobby\/valet\/taxi area is relatively far off the strip on Tropicana. So if you try to find the ""front"" of the hotel by using your natural sense of direction, you will end up in the sports book. 

MGM also houses Studio 54 nightclub which is a great club several nights a week. Tuesdays and Fridays have both been fun there. 

I rarely play the table games at the MGM. The $10 tables are usually too crowded and I refuse to EVER play more than that as a minimum bet. What's the point? I can bet $50 a hand at a $10 table, but don't have to if I'm not feelin' the cards.

If you like slot machines, you will be in heaven. There are more slot machines than people on the casino floor... and the casino floor is always busy.

The dining options at MGM are varied. You can get McDonald's, greasy chinese, pizza, starbucks\/cafe food or you can go to one of their many sit down restaurants. They have a buffet which is pretty decent. Coupons are always floating around for the buffet and I would definitely suggest finding one first unless you want to pay $25-$30 for brunch. The cheapest sit down is the Rainforest Cafe. 

The only ""upscale"" restaurant I have eaten at in the MGM is Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. It was OK but definitely not worth the [moderate] price tag and the service was far less than stellar. We actually had to send our water and glasses back because they had a weird fishy\/river\/mildew smell. The wine selection for ""by the glass"" was lacking. We left full, but not satisfied and vowed to go to a non-hotel restaurant the next time. Also, they claim to be a casual attire restaurant but nobody (including us because we were heading to a club afterward) was dressed casually and I'm sure anyone who did dress casually would have felt under dressed. 

This hotel isn't intended for children. It has more upscale restaurants, shows and entertainment options that most kids would not enjoy. Also, they will get tired just walking from one end to the other. I always say Circus Circus is the best kid-friendly hotel anyway (see other review). Kids will likely enjoy the lion habitat but not for long as the lions don't do much most of the time... so don't make any special trips if you are short on time. Of course, M&M World is just a few minutes walk down the strip so you could always park at MGM, hit the lion habitat and then head to M&M World for some colorful browsing.",1,0,0

So meanwhile we decided to use the hot tub (we had the spa suite) and while we were in the hot tub the maintenance guy just walked in on us (despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on the door). Then the air conditioning went out(mid day in Sept.  100° +) they did come up to fix it..OVER AN HOUR LATER!! They never apologized or tried to compensate us in any way.  When we checked out we told them about the inconvenience and the guy reluctantly said ""well I guess I can refund your $20 resort fee"" I will not be staying here again!",0,0,0

He told me if I could not afford it to go downtown and walked away.  I left the drink and left.  It took almost half an hour to get my car from valet.

The bathrooms and beds are a great size and comfortable to be in. I also liked that there are so many places to grab food-plus there is 24 hour room service! I totally took advantage of this. It was AMAZING. There is a new club in MGM which is fun and a bunch of bars to visit. You are right on the strip and if you want to you can hang out the pool which has a fun party during the day.

We were in the tower. 

First off, this is a BUSY hotel and not quiet or private. It's Grand central station. But even though its crazy busy, I have to give their front desk staff a lot of respect and they are out there in the line, filtering and guiding people to open clerks. So they definitely have their crowd control down. 

My main complaint is that the rooms are ""old"". Not in the sense that you're looking at a pastel flowers bed spread or a Nagel picture, but old in the sense that it was built over 10 years ago (which is like 40 in Vegas years) before more advanced insulation and noise reducing concrete walls were standard. So you can hear your neighbors upstairs, downstairs, outside. Unfortunately for me, I overheard a domestic dispute at 3am. Fortunately for me, I couldn't tell which room it was coming from! Up? Down? Left? Right? 

We went to the West Wing Bar and went through that part of the hotel. I spied inside one of the rooms as it was open being cleaned. And yes that room is super new but its also super small! If I was there just to drink\/gamble and wasn't going to use that room for other than a sh*t and a shower, then it'd be a serious option.

Either way, the only way I'd stay at this hotel again is if there's a big concert or event going down. But truth be told I'd probably stay at the back property, The Signature, instead. It's hella far away but close to the MGM Grand Arena anyway. Our friends were staying there and its what you'd expect of the MGM.  My recap:

Pros:
-This resort has everything. You really don't need to leave
-The Grand Arena\/special events\/concerts
-Great deals mid week. Definitely these rooms are worth it at $44\/night
-Great service from front desk staff and hotel staff
-Of course the lion habitat.


Cons:
-Really busy; all the time, 
-Not the newest hotel rooms; noisy and not very private",2,1,0

I'm sure you old timers will already know that the original MGM Grand actually sat on LV Blvd and Flamingo Road until that deadly fire in 1980, where 85 souls perished.. That structure is now Bally's Las Vegas.

This building was built around the remains of the old Marina Hotel and Casino. Opening at the very end of 1993, this casino started out with a ""Wizard of Oz"" theme, including walking in the Lion's mouth as the main entrance. This was considered bad luck with many a valued Asian tourist, so that was quickly changed.

Anyways, enough with the history lesson. This review is for the casino only, as I have not had the pleasure of staying in one of the rooms...yet.

This place is freaking massive! Huge! I mean ginormous! This, in my opinion, is the 2nd biggest maze of a casino on the strip! (Sorry, Caesar's Palace still owns that title!) 

Whenever I have friends or family visit from out of town, I make it a point to make sure they see this casino. There's that iconic statue of the Lion on the corner of Tropicana and LV Blvd. They have some great food eateries on site. They also boast Hakkasan Nightclub, the MGM Garden Arena, and Cirque Du Soleil's production of Ka!

The casino is always kept very clean, which is impressive considering the amount of foot traffic that this place sees! Most employees I have encountered have been very friendly and engaging. 

I think it kind of blows they took the Lion Habitat out of here in 2012, but this is Las Vegas and things are constantly changing!

I really enjoy visiting this casino and I plan on doing a staycation here in the near future! I will definitely update this review after that experience!

4 stars for a Vegas Icon!",18,8,12

They are all exceptionally nice and seem truly happy to answer my questions about where's this and where's that even though there's directories everywhere- it's just easier to ask a person!  The work ethic of the employees is great too!  I never saw a single person standing around doing nothing which is nice because if I had seen that, it'd be so easy for me to say that this hotel is not committed to making this the best stay for every guest. Seeing everyone busy contributing to the overall success of their individual jobs made me feel like I'm in good hands and that they ARE working towards making it the best stay ever!

Next, the cleanliness. Just WOW!  Listen, it's Vegas, ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,"" right?  Even the dirty scummy stuff.  I wasn't expecting the overall property to be as clean as it was- especially the rooms which I'm sure get used and abused!  I live in NJ and am familiar with the hotels in Atlantic City. The ONLY hotel I feel good about saying is clean is Borgata. They really are nasty. (For example- my friend and I stayed in Ballys, her bed sheets were not the cleanest and she's very picky about that. She called for new sheets- and those has blood stains -we assume). It was appalling.

I ate at the buffet daily- the food is delicious and fresh. 

Pool area is good!  Wish it was open a little later like 7\/8pm on weekdays as it's still plenty hot out (September)

I will definitely be back in the late spring, coming to MGM Grand specifically and bringing a group with me (I came alone this time)",1,0,0

It is not as expensive as the Bellagio and it is nicer than some of the older hotels located on the north strip like Circus Circus or the Flamingo.

The room rate is average but you should be aware of a few charges that are not advertised on the front page of your reservation.  There will be a resort fee which is mainly for the wifi but I imagine it covers other costs like pool admission etc.  This fee for us was $25.  When it comes to the wifi you will have to reconnect to it throughout the day as you go to and from your room and throughout the MGM resort.  It also worked at the Bellagio as this is a MGM brand resort.  So in all the wifi can be convenient at times and inconvenient during others.

*Other room charges to be aware of are not really charges but deposits.  You may see a credit card charge for a couple hundred dollars more than they tell you at the front desk but this is a security deposit for the room.  Once you check out and everything is checked in the room you will get this money back.  

The MGM is branded by their bronze lion.  The huge bronze lion at the front of the building, in the main lobby, and on the elevator doors.  You won't miss it and will be familiar with it by the end of your stay.  

MGM was the best choice for us and I was extremely happy with our stay.  The room we had looked exactly like it was shown online and was very clean.  Room service was daily and tremendously efficient.  They even lined up my shoes for me.  They knew exactly what to touch and throw away and what not to.  I was really happy to find my things taken care of as I would.  

MGM, like all of the resorts, provides with anything and everything you need so there is no need to ever leave the huge resort.  They have restaurants, shops, entertainment, pool, gambling, night club, literally everything.  Not only did I love the resort in general but it was great to be able to go to Hakkasan and Wet Republic within your own resort.  I imagine the other night clubs and day clubs are fun as well but again it is so convenient to have these options within walking distance.  I say walking distance because these resorts are ginormous and what may look like across the street or down the way on Google Maps is actually a 10-15 minute walk.  To walk the whole strip is really not feasible.  

I can go on and on but many of my rants and raves about MGM will take place in my reviews for all of the specific entities within the resort.",4,0,2

Rooms were comfortable but not sure how often they deep clean. There were food crumbs on the tray that was sitting on the bed. Found a ""foreign hair"" on the bathroom floor.  One of our towels had stains. And the walls of the shower & curtain looked a little grimy. Otherwise the room was nice, spacious and comfy. You cannot use the ref bc they pack it with bar goods. LOVED the pools and lazy river (which closes at 6pm, fyi). Didn't really mingle with staff so cannot comment much on the customer service. Front desk did allow us to check out at noon instead to time with our flight, which was nice. 

TIPS:
- if you bring in a rental car, add parking to your room card when you check in, that way if you're in and out, you don't need to start a new tab. You'll use your room card to access and leave the structure.
- if you find yourself waiting long for an elevator for the Grand Tower, hidden behind the doors at the end of the hallway are 2 additional elevators. You're welcome! 
- got away with bringing our own inner tubes to the pool. Perhaps bc it was a weekday
- want to avoid the rowdy crowd at the pool? Go 9am.... have kids? Settle by the tide pool... perfect start and entrance to the lazy river
FOOD COURT,
we ate at quite a few. The coupons on the eat in trays are gold! If you're trying to save a few bucks, they're great to use.
Liked,
The fried chicken place! Tenders were hot, crispy and super delicious! One of the best I've had.
- The carne asada from the Mexican joint. Don't get the carnitas.. tooooo sweet. Also, their tacos comes with only 1 tortilla each.. easy to break. 
- burger joint is safe. They serve breakfast under $8.
DISLIKED, the italian stand gave subpar pizza and spaghetti for the price, even with coupon.

Ka is a great show worth checking out.

Customer service at this airportesque casino\/hotel was really bad. I spoke with probably around 10 different MGM employees over the course of my stay and the 9th person was really nice. Everyone up until then had been impolite. A lot of it was people just speaking in that ""I'm not going to take any crap"" type of voice and being unhelpful.

Pub 1842 was a great place to go, good beer selection and the pretzels and cheese with soft poached egg is fantastic!  The only downer was I asked for a chocolate martini, not one of their signature mixed drinks, and received a watered down $12 mistake, get the beer or one of their fruities and you will stay on a good track.  Ask for Juan as your server, he is friendly and likes to chat about the food and beer!
Now some small cons.  We were in a room that had an attached door, we could here the loud, at times dramatic, conversations from the next room.  The hotel smelled like old vanilla, they pump it through the vents to keep the smell of smoke down.  Internet, you can get it for free, two hours at a time, but it was sloooooowwww.  Other wise you could pay a daily fee.  Sorry but the amount you pay to stay there I think a little fast bandwidth should be included!  Not that I was there to use the web, but when you are looking up places to go and check out it would have just been nice to have the quicker speed.
Will definitely stay here again!",1,2,0

There was no view for us, but rather an eyesore of the roof below.

Green outer spotlights of the hotel blinded us while in the room during the night hours  essentially rendering the window completely useless and a hindrance.  I would have  expected the hotel to at least wash the outer windows effected by the lights as it certainly showcased just how absolutely filthy they were.  

Fortunately we had the option of completely blacking out the window by lowering the shade, otherwise sleeping would have required sedation.  

Our shower clogged leaving us standing in 8 inches of water before stepping out.

The Ice machine was a quarter of a mile walk outside our hotel room door, all the way down the hall and into another hallway.  

Nothing was complimentary, not even a bottled water.

Internet WI\/FI prices were ridiculous, around 20 dollars for 10 hours beginning from when you accepted the terms, not actual usage time.

Plan on walking great distances for just about anything you want at this hotel.

Certainly I shouldn't expect to pay anything less than premium at any hotel on the strip, however, at $500 for two nights, a few complimentary waters, some free Internet access, and somewhat of a view would have been nice.  

No need to elaborate any further on those items that are completely unacceptable.",3,1,1

While the hotel is very beautiful I would NOT recommend staying here.  We drove in from Phoenix to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We chose MGM Grand specifically for the lazy river, needing some chill time.  Although nothing like the one in the Bahamas, it sounded like a relaxing time.  

Disappointment #1:  Upon arrival we noticed that someone had broken a glass and it was not cleaned up properly.  The bathroom and vanity area had multiple pieces of glass, small and nickel size pieces.  Called housekeeping and a gentleman ""swept"" a little. Off we go to enjoy Vegas.  When we returned, we noticed still more glass and figured we'd walk around our room with flip flops until it could be cleaned in the AM.  I was mistaken.  Housekeeper #2 also missed it.  We gave up and just decided to just walk around in our flip flops and agreed not to stay at MGM Grand again.

Disappointment #2:  Was very disappointed, after paying $16 for tube rental we went around the river once and returned our tubes for a refund.  Lazy river is more like a social hangout for groups and the tubes are and after thought.  Too many people standing around in the pool we couldn't get around the river without bumping into a lot of people.  These weren't small groups, most were 5-10 people just standing on side of pool.

These disappointments did not prevent us from enjoying our anniversary.  We just agreed that MGM was a bad choice and hung out at other casinos and only slept here (bed was comfortable) .  Lessons learned...stick to what you know...much better experience at other strip hotels!",5,1,0

Exibit A: Taken from a portion of my bill from  my last stay there Jan 10 2013

2013-01-10 MGM Room Tax - 12% 18.87
2013-01-10 MGM Resort Fee 25.00
2013-01-10 MGM Resort Fee Tax - 12% 3.00

The room is taxed and the resort fee is taxed separately!  WTHM

When your online gitty about booking your vegas getaway, and your on mgm.com booking the room they only tell you about the room rate. Then when you check out and are ready to put down the deposit, they add at the bottom. reservation subject to a daily resort fee which will be added. ok fine. 

Then when you get your confirmation, mine was for 3 nights, they kindly add the $75 ($25 per day resort fee). ok fine.

Then when you get your bill at check out, %12-a-geddon breaks out on your bill. as you see above. For a 3 night stay I paid $147 in fees and taxes.  That's bullshit. 

Stupidness #2 The Petite King Room. 

When they say Petite, they mean PETITE!. This room is meant for one person and one person only. Please do not share this room because there is no separation from the bathroom and the room, and ladies, absolutely NO counter space (eeeek!).  You walk in the door and your in the bathroom with tempered glass separating you from the toilet and the shower. If you get a bad reaction from the buffet, just plan on your roommate getting to know whats inside of you, if you know whadda mean. 

Please when reserving review the room outlay plans on the hotel tab. Something I wish I would have done before booking the Petite King room. 

The Good

With taxes and fees included,  my 3 day stay was $166.67 per day.  For its location on the strip and tram access to other hotels ($12 for 24hr pass)  It hits on average for a non peak season stay. I just wished they'd been more up front about the taxes and fees.

Convenient Location

Smooth Check In

Good Casual and Formal dining spots (I recommend Fiamma, great italian food :)

Friendly Staff

KA, the best show in Vegas

Great booking incentives (I got tickets to Chris Angel Believe with my booking)

It had been turned off for several rooms on the floor for 'emergency maintenance'.  12 stinking noon. 

These days I find the gaming here to be very mediocre.  Maybe its just the vibe from the dealers and snappy or outright rude drink ladies.   Something is definitely amiss here.  Like super bad gambling feng shui.  What does salvage the gaming is a good poker room which I tend to frequent when I'm in LV.

Having done almost everything that this casino has to offer (KA, Crazy Horse, Tabu, etc.) its hard to ignore that the MGM has a lot to offer the casual visitor.  Maybe familiarity does breed contempt because MGM has lost some of its luster in my eyes.

I did get 1 hot shower and the remaining were all cold.  The front desk claimed at full capacity that can be an issue.  At checkout I refused to pay the resort fee since they couldn't provide hot water.  The check-out personnel did comply, but showed no concern over my poor experience.

Cool pool complex. 

But... Where has the quality gone?

The MGM is a nice enough Vegas Strip hotel, with lots of amenities, don't get me wrong, but there were enough things wrong that I wouldn't stay here again. The quality felt lost, seemingly because they cater to such a very high influx of guests.

We had a bad smell upon entry in our room. Whew...Yuck! The beds were a bit too soft and were probably ready to be replaced. The T.V. had  issues and no help arrived after we were told someone would come look at it. The air conditioning did not work well so the room could not be cooled down as much as we would have liked. 

If you do come here, see about becoming an M-Life Member (players club) prior to check-in. You can avoid the long line to check-in. We waited around 45 minutes. There's a much shorter line off to the side for M-Life Members. With that said, they did have nice water to drink for those waiting in the long line.


The complex is very large and spread out so be prepared to walk.

I've stayed at Paris and Treasure Island previously. Both of these are better for their proximity on the strip.",3,0,1

The bed was very comfortable and room was a good size. Nothing special but a perfectly okay hotel room which is all I need. There's no fridge in your room and don't commandeer the minibar or there's a $50 restocking fee. Also, they do offer free wifi included in your resort fee but it's spotty at best. The hotel is huge so you might need a Sherpa guide to find your way back to your room. 

As for the casino, it's not bad but is very oddly laid out and can be confusing and had to navigate. They do have a decent variety of table games and machines and okay drink service. For something different, find the old school jockey horse racing game in the corner of the casino near the buffet. This thing is cheap and fun but can get crowded. You bet a quarter on these mechanical horses that race around the track and they each have odds. No modern tickets here, you play with actual quarters. 

This place is huge and has an interesting variety of restaurants, bars, and quick eats including Whiskey Down which is a 24 hour whiskey bar, Pub 1842 which I enjoyed, and a food court with McDonald's, pizza, etc. The location is far on one end of the strip so it's a trek to the other end of the strip.

What you don't expect is that the lights all up and down the sides of the building will illuminate your room with the most sickly green color ever.  That's about the only negative thing I can think of though.  

My wallet is always sad when I spend time on the Strip, because the entire thing is one big tourist trap, so I expect to lose money and overspend wherever I go.

Downsides - that same location means that it's at the edge of the action on the Strip, so those that like to walk (a highly unrecommended idea on a 110 degree August day) should be prepared to walk for a while to find interesting things.

About those remodeled rooms - the so-called ""Grander"" rooms have decent linens and nice bathrooms. Furniture is updated and tvs have multiple video hookups - you can hook up your own technology and watch movies on the TV. (Slow) internet is included in the resort fee, but cell phone reception was terrible for Sprint and AT&T - an annoyance when trying to coordinate people (and we know how tough it is to coordinate a group of people in Las Vegas anyway).  I did love the digital safe tucked into a drawer.  I felt like James Bond as I slipped my valuables next to the bed. More hotels should do this.

The hotel is weird in that it has small vestiges of a movie theme - workers areas still say ""cast members only,"" the pools have movie-related names and there are tv studio-related features, and little MGM lion heads are everywhere.  All in all, you might not even notice that this place even has a theme anymore - it's trying to be a little more reserved than the theme casinos but isn't as nice as the upscale ones.  Some decent (but not spectacular) restaurants and the in-house nightlife is only good enough for those too lazy to leave this hotel.

The clear highlight? It has a pretty solid pool scene. There are at least 5 pools with different setups and moods - from family friendly to grownup and fun to quiet and laid back. I spend as much time here as possible. And lets not forget another highlight - Wet Republic, which I'll cover in another review.  Also, my friends who gamble seem to do well here (at least that explains why they keep coming back).

So, what do I think of the MGM? It's just ok, but probably better than most hotels at this end of the Strip.  I would stay here again if I had a great deal. At regular rates, I'll go find something at the Signature (see that review too).",2,2,1

Rooms:

I have stayed in a couple of different styles of rooms and were impressed by all. The wall is ultra thin. I was not impressed by the level of noise when I stayed in grand tower. Basically the room next door played loud music for 24 hours straight. If it was really 24 hours straight, I have no idea. But every time I am back in the room, the music was on. It was super loud and the thin wall did not help. I could also clearly hear exactly what the couple had to say and TMI that I did not need to hear. Things like that guy was taking a shower and the girl was on the phone. I also overheard them asking when their friend is going to check out. I was slightly reliefed to hear that they were checking out the morning after. I don't think they were extra loud. The wall was just too thin. It was almost like they were standing feet away from me and talking. The loud music continued until they left the room. 

Lobby:

Really grand and bright colored. A huge contrast from its casino. Check in and check out are pretty fast during my stays here. I have never had to wait for too long in the line. The line CAN get super long in the afternoons. The last time I was here, there was some football star doing an appearance. Lots of people were taking pictures. I didn't know who the guy was when I went up close so I didn't take any pictures. Concierge is friendly but not super helpful.

Light is dim and smoke everywhere. Is there a non-smoking section here? I don't know. Waiters come around pretty often to offer water and drinks. Of course, you have to tip. I didn't really like the smell in the casino. Bathroom is clean.

Commute from the airport:

So convenient! During my first time here, I took a taxi. On a tourist website, they said the trip would cost around $12 - 15 and it was around that range. Then I discovered its local bus pass system and you pay $8 for a day pass or $20 for 3-day pass. I took the bus back to the airport from here and it was so convenient. When I came back to MGM grand, I did not even think twice and took the bus again. It drops you off in front of MGM.

Tips:

Watch out for your bill here. The first time I was here, they placed $500 hold on my credit card for incidental charges. I thought that was way too much. The second time I was here, the hold for incidental charges were much lower. I think it was around $100 for incidental charges the second time. 

They have free internet here. Use it. It is probably the only thing that is worthy of your daily resort fee. I have never visited its fitness center so I cannot comment on that. The free newspaper is right next to its mini grocery store right next to the elevator to go upstairs. Otherwise you get charged $25 daily resort fee during your stay here.

There is no fridge in your room. I don't remember seeing any fridge in any of the rooms that I stayed in. There was a small fridge in the room in grand tower. I looked into the fridge and it was full of soda and alcohol. I poked around a bit and then saw a small sign reads ""place personal item in your fridge may cause charges for up to $50 per day."" So I didn't mess with it again. When I checked out, I noticed there was a $4 on refreshment center. I asked the guy about it and he asked if I had purchased a sprite there. I said no and I poked around the fridge and that was about it. He said, well that is the problem, if you take any item out for longer than 30 seconds and even if you put it back in there after that, they will automatically charge you on your credit card. Although he was nice and gave the $4 back to me. Still, I thought that was not very convenient. You can pay an additional $25 to store personal items at their fridge on each floor.",0,0,0

The room was very clean and modern, loved the fact there was a lot of mirrors!  Except we got a view of the back of the hotel instead of the strip, but they were fully booked so we couldn't switch rooms.

The casino was always lively.  We attended one of the Television City programs in the hotel which was pretty cool.

The self parking was far from the hotel, I suggest you do valet parking it's also free, but you just have to tip the valet staff. 

This hotel is at the beginning of the strip, which we didn't mind because we drove to to different parts of the strip and walked.  Just don't take Las Vegas Blvd!  Learn the small streets behind the hotels.

I think the resort fee was around $25 per night, includes wifi, which we found was pretty good.  I know there were a few complaints about the wifi, but we didn't have any issues.

The beds were fantastic, there was no smoke bleed from smoking rooms (a HUGE plus), climate control was super easy, great water pressure, and the water got hot very quickly. Additionally, when I had an issue with the iron in the room, they were incredibly helpful and prompt in resolving the issue. They truly have the excellent customer service thing DOWN.

I did come here for work and had no intention on gambling. Walking thru the Casino I couldnt help myself so I showed a co-worker how to make $20 turn into $40, $40 into $80, and so on... I ended up playing craps, three card poker, war, and 1-2 Poker. I only pulled $20 out of pocket and by the time I had headed to my room I had about $420 in hand.

I would advise you to take your own bags to the room. 

The room was smaller than normal but we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room so I was fine with that. No LCD TV however there was a TV built into the bathroom sink mirror.

I'll let myself go on a gambling binge, all in the name of fun.  So when I do, I don't expect to have asshole pit bosses sitting there and trying to ruin my experience.

After my brother and I picked up some Davidoff's, we went in to roll some dice - a favorite past time.  However, once lit up, we had the floors giving us nasty looks and constantly telling us to blow the smoke another direction.  While I understand that the smoke can be annoying if blown in your face, it's one thing if I blow it versus having the circulation pattern blowing back at you despite my best efforts.

On top of that, having a dealer calling the floor out to kick my friend out when he loudly exclaimed, ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"" in the high roller room after losing a $2k hand - that's over the top.  Just because he lost your damn paycheck doesn't mean you should be a dick about it.  I mean hell, who wouldn't want to exclaim something like that after losing that much?  Gladly it wasn't.  What was funny is that he ended up getting ""escorted out"" - they walked him to the door, asked him by name to wait one minute (he's a good man to have playing at your joint with the money he throws around), and then didn't stop him when he came back into the casino.  

Of course he dropped many more f-bombs while watching us play until we got tired of her attitude and just swept our chips to go to another friendlier casino.  Again, not my favorite spot - the dealers spoiled it for me plus it's just too crowded there being a ""named"" spot on the strip.",0,2,3

I was looking for a hotel along the strip and this world famous hotel sounded like a good option. But honestly, there are so many hotels to choose from that are modern and have that chic sexy feel, so you can definitely book something way better. 

Cons:
-Although very popular, the hotel seems a bit dated
-The lighting in the room is so dim and inadequate, its almost impossible to get dressed or apply makeup outside of the bathroom
-The hotel does not offer any special perks to their guests (vegas is known for their party life and with several hotels competing for a large turnout, MGM needs to step it up and offer their guests discounted tickets to Wet Republic or at least a free buffet for one night)
-The admission tickets to Wet Republic were outrageous (because a popular guest was spinning that weekend. again hotel guests should receive some kind of incentive) 
-Room service took a while to arrive and the food was very underwhelming
- Not all floors have an ice machine. You must travel to another floor to get a bucket of ice which at times can be annoying

Pros
-Housekeeping was very accommodating and always made sure our room was up to par
-The hotel is huge
-Even if you do not want to be bothered with the rowdiness of the pool party at Wet Republic, there is a smaller pool where you can see and here all the action for FREE
-Location, Location, Location. the hotel is located right in the center of all the madness and is smack in the middle of the strip which is excellent. 
-the casino floor is VERY large and the waitresses, floor manager and staff are very friendly 
-The liquor served on the casino floor is strong .. which is great and the MGM points rewards card is helpful when making purchases in the hotel


Our room was cool, though it could use some upgrades .. it was a great deal for the space. I would suggest the Cosmopolitan or even some of the newer hotels further down the strip. If the hotel does not start offering some sort of perks they will be overshadowed by all the newcomers. Still thanks for stress free trip MGM.",1,0,0

My fiance and I booked one night at the MGM because he had a series of meetings at the hotel and we thought it would be an easy place to stay. When we got there we had to wait in a line to check in. The line didn't seem that long, but it moved at a snail's pace. There were plenty of workers standing at desks, but they were chatting away with each other and paying no attention to guests. When one person would finish, no one would call the next person up or make eye contact with them. 

When we finally got to the desk, there were no rooms ready - though it was just noon, so I could see that happening. My fiance got us pre-registered and they told us they would call us when the room is ready, but then in the same breath, told us to call them to find out if the room was ready. I asked which it was and the answer was ""yes"" - which gave me no answers. My fiance then asked if I could be the one to get the room information when it was ready because he was going into a meeting. He had already included my name on the registration and the person at the desk said that was fine and took my name and number. 

We attempted to go check our bags so we didn't have to drag them around, but the line was ridiculous, so we started to wander around the lobby trying to find somewhere to sit. But there are only a handful of benches, which were full - otherwise you need to go to lounge\/gaming tables\/slots\/restaurants - all which require money. On top of it, you can barely hear yourself think because they are blaring music throughout the whole hotel. 

An hour goes by and we call to check on the room - still not ready. Another hour later and my fiance has gone into the meeting, and I call to check on our room. The woman tells me that yes, it's ready, but that she can only give my fiance the room number because only his name is on the room. I mention that we checked with the desk guy when we checked in and he took my name and number and said I could get the room information. She wouldn't budge - even after i explained everything, including that my fiance was in a meeting and unreachable. I hung up and tried to get a hold of my fiance. 

He was eventually able to step out and call them to get the room number. I got up to the floor only to find that the first key I put in the door didn't work. Thankfully, the second one did. I entered the room and was taken aback by the smell of cigarette smoke being masked by heavy perfume - it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. To top it off, the toiletries in the bathroom were half full - so it's evident they weren't changed out when the room was made up for us. At this point I'm exhausted and just wanted to take a nap. 

Two and a half hours later, my cell phone rings and it's the front desk calling to tell me that my room is ready - the one that I'm already attempting to sleep in. Like the person I spoke to when I called, this person only wanted to speak to my fiance, even though she clearly had the phone number that was given with my name when we checked in. Plus, here it was two and half hours after our room was ready (at least) and they were just calling to tell us. I hung up. 

Today - after we've already checked out, we both get emails reminding us to check out - with guess what on the bill - my name. So it's evident that my name is on the room, but not one person at the desk chose to acknowledge that and forced me to drag my fiance out of work to check in. 

Next time I go to Vegas, I'll be picking somewhere else, no matter the convenience.",6,1,1

Overall, I think the hotel is bi-polar. Some ends try to be affordable, while others try to be chic\/trendy and very pricey.  Prices equal, I'd stay at Mandalay over MGM every time.

It's huge! You need a map to get around the ground level. The Casino is huge lots of tables spread out all over.  The minimums can get pricey.

Studio 54 is MGM's club. I've reviewed it on here as well, long story short not recommended at all. Hopefully they re do it to a Vegas standard. The pool here is very popular and they can't have a nightclub overshadowed by the pool, that's just not right. Step your game up!

Hotel rooms are interesting. Since they are so large and expanded their basic rooms depend on where you are placed. The deluxe room is the standard two bedroom look. the beds are comfortable but the room seems to be slightly smaller than other two bedroom hotels. Nothing significant. The tv was old and bathroom was average.

The west wing rooms are fixed up to look more modern. Some furniture is nice an trendy, while other pieces look tacky and cheap. small bathrooms.

The hotel floors are long and sometimes you get stuck far from both elevators. Not good for drunken walks back to the hotel room.

They have good comp lengths. They offer 3 day comps and I once called the night before new years and got a free room for the weekend. Can't be mad at that!

Most dining options are all very pricey. All their expensive restaurants are nearby and heavily advertised. this is where the bi-polarity is evident. Decent priced hotel, wide range of table minimums, comped rooms, but very few ""cheap"" dining options. their cafe was overpriced, slow service and tasted average.

-The rooms....if you have a chance to upgrade, go for the Hollywood Suite!  I stayed here for a week in college and it was so much fun!  Other rooms I've stayed in are also nice.

-Studio 54...for some reason I really like this club!  I love the aerial dancers and the Go-Go dancers (male and female) have to be some of the hottest in town.  If you are only going to the club, park at Tropicana and walk across the bridge...I think it's faster than parking in the garage.

-David Copperfield...this is a very entertaining show!  Magical, to say the least!

-KA....amazing!  One of my top 3 favorite cirque shows in Las Vegas!

-Fat Tuesday...just walk down from the main lobby and you'll find the Fat Tuesdays stand among a couple other shops.

-The pool....absolutely cool!  The lazy river is fun but it's just as entertaining to lay out and enjoy your surroundings. 

-I've only seen the lions a couple times.  When you actually get to see them, it's really fun.  I'm a sucker for tourist attractions, even though I've lived here several years.

-Not sure what the name of their café is but it's very good.  I've had breakfast there a couple times and have never had a bad meal. 

Things I dislike:

-The walk from the parking garage to the main casino floor feels like an eternity!  Make sure to have your walking shoes on!  

-I'm not a fan of Tabu.

Since my last visit to the hotel (6 years ago), I noticed that the renovations has assisted in making the MGM a ""better"" hotel to stay in. I booked a standard room and enjoyed the newly updated furnishings quite a bit. There is more feminine vibe with the use of fuchsia, maroon, and floral prints. I especially enjoyed the fact that the TV now a plasma. Before, the TV unit was hidden inside a large armoire. 

Although the MGM Grand is located towards the end of the Strip, the pricing for the hotel rooms are always the best and never breaks my budget. Self parking for the MGM does suck.",0,0,0

A recent stay at MGM Grand proved to be comfortable, yet inconvenient at the same time. Let me explain. MGM is massive - the advantage is that everything that you could possibly want is under one roof - nightlife (Hakkasan), day club (Wet Republic), pool, spa, high end dining (Joel Robuchon), shows (KA, David Copperfield), etc. The disadvantage is that walking distances can be... well... a pain. It may be a small gripe, but the inconvenience does add up. 

Tip: If you're staying at MGM, be sure to ask for a room next to the elevator - this will save you from having to walk a great distance just to get to your room (and will save you the walk when you want to get ice). 

The newly renovated rooms are nice - they have a clean, modern look to them. One drawback to the newly renovated room is that the in-room technology is not quite up to the newer resorts on the strip - you can't control lighting, blinds, etc from the TV a la Aria. The newly renovated rooms do have automated blind controls, but for some reason, there is only one switch, and it is located near the window, which means that if you want to open the windows, you'll have to walk over to the window to do so (again, just a minor inconvenience, but what's the point of automation if you still have to walk over to do it)?

Overall, MGM's a good option for the south strip - just remember to bring some comfortable walking shoes. 

Tip: The Starbucks next to the coffee shop (Avenue 24) is the most expensive Starbucks I have ever seen - $4.50 for a grande Americano... and they don't take Starbucks gift cards... avoid it like the plague... unless you have Express Comps to burn through mLife.",6,1,2

The room we had was fairly modern looking, and there was a decent view of Tropicana and Mandalay Bay hotels. The noise carried a lot from the neighboring rooms. I could tell what music they were playing and was even woken up once by the sound of our neighbors hairdryer. The bathroom had no fan or ventilation whatsoever. 

If you're staying at the MGM, or any other hotel on the strip be prepared to pay way too much for everything! At one of the convenience stores inside, I spent $26 on a small bottle of water and two small sandwiches that were not fresh and made my boyfriend sick. 

There are mini bars in each room, however they're locked and in order to get into them someone from concierge has to come up and open it for you. You can't store leftovers or any other items in the fridge unless you pay the $25 per day fee (plus tax). 

The MGM is a great place to stay if you're not looking to go far. It's close to the airport, there's a lot to see within the hotel, and the booking prices are reasonable.

Yes, it's an insanely busy time for Vegas hotels.. but the MGM can handle it. It's massive...they're all massive, but this one has got one of the largest casinos (bad news if you're like me and rather go shopping than waste $ gambling). 

The hotel room was fine, no complaints. I think there was only approx 10 channels on the TV which I found strange. Bed, furniture- all great. Water pressure= bad. (aha! the dirty details you wanna know, right?)

We were on the 20-somethingth floor with a sweeet view facing the strip, looking out at NY,NY and the Excalibur- I HIGHLY recommend requesting a strip view!

Service was pretty good, they delivered and stored our baggage in a safe and timely manner. The cab line outside is ridiculously inefficient, filling 1 cab at a time, but I've realized Vegas is not the place for efficiency. I really enjoyed that MGM had a 'Witchcraft. We grabbed sammies there twice. All in all, I think it's one of many OK Vegas establishments. If I had a bigger budget I would have splurged for the Bellagio or Venetian.

I wanted to give it 4 stars but it gets 3 because of my BIGGEST complaint-- the smell of MGM's lobby & casino.

The remodeling transformation is well underway.  The new design is sleek and modern.  I kinda miss the former homage to Hollywood design concept, but alas the MGM Grand has to keep up with the newer stylish hotels that have quickly sprang up on the strip.  As always the hospitality is great.  I spent my three days poolside at the River Pool which is a great place to hang out. It has a nice balance of single folks and families...nothing crazy or scandalous, just people having fun.  I do have to say that the only thing I did notice on this last trip was that the prices of food and beverage throughout the complex were slightly higher than a few months ago.

Overwhelming numbers of rooms + people + Ultimate Fighting Championship made this a real disappointment.  We saw 2 people getting arrested in two different bars here so let's just say the crowd was not the best.  

We ate at the Studio Cafe, Fiamma (the Italian restaurant) and Wolfgang Pucks and service was SLOW.  When we at at Wolfgang Puck's, we waited 40 minutes for lunch when there were only about a dozen other tables. The entree at Fiamma was so salty that it made me nauseous after 3 bites, and was overpriced (about $25) for a tiny little plate of pasta.

The West Wing Bar was the only good experience we had here.  The bartender was friendly and the drink specials were good.  It was a nice place to have a drink away from the casino noise.

5-star rating for the AMAZING Yvonne in Housekeeping. As we were putting my son to bed tonight we discovered he had left his stuffed monkey, the one he's had since he was a newborn, back in our hotel room. He was devastated. We made a quick call to the MGM Grand and were transferred to Housekeeping where the wonderful Yvonne located the monkey and is mailing it to us. She was so sweet to our son when he got on the phone and tearily told her thank you for finding his monkey.

4-star rating for the hotel itself. Yes, it is humongous. But I found the signage and layout easy to follow. Parking was super easy and accesible off of Koval.  I liked the hotel's location toward the end of the strip because I felt like traffic congestion was minimal. Restaurant options were plentiful. Room was clean and we had lots of towels, toiletries, etc. Noise level in the room was very low but I could still the next door shower going. Suprised there was no minifridge (other than the one stocked with overpriced snacks and drinks) or coffeemaker.

2-star rating for David Copperfield's magic show. Some very cool tricks but there was ZERO enthusiasm on his part. He mumbled a lot of his dialogue. Completely phoned-in performance. Bummed that we spent nearly $300 (even with a 20% discount!) on this. The space alien part of the show was downright boring.

We have stayed at either Wynn or Encore each time we have visited Vegas together and obviously the bar is set pretty high. For some odd reason, I decided to switch it up and try some place new. Terrible mistake. Upon arrival and after waiting an hour on line to check in, we were informed that the rate was significantly higher than the promotional rate I used to book the reservation. When I asked to speak with someone about this, I should have been more specific and asked to speak with someone in person because I was handed a telephone receiver. 400 people checking in, a very loud lobby area and I can't hear a word. Not good. What I did hear was the regurgitation of the terrible news I had already been given and that ""the last person to visit your account was you sir."" That's rich. 

Fast forward to the next morning when we attempt to shower and I attempt to shave. The shower is backed up with 7 inches of water (nasty) and of course, the sink is backed up as well. Can't shower and can't shave under these conditions!! Of course, they are going to send someone to fix it ASAP. Off we go to our brunch reservation with half a shower and looking like a couple of hobo's!!

When I checked back with the front desk to ensure the plumbing issues had been addressed, the wonderful agent (April needs a promotion and a raise) I was given a wonderful bit of news. April saw my angry check in outburst the day before and decided to double check my reservation now that I was standing before her. Turns out, the promotional offer wasn't given, as I mentioned before and she was able to give us the correct promo rate. Awesome on her, but that's not cool. This should have been the experience upon check in, not the day after when reporting a problem. Come on folks!!

I had a GREAT time at the MGM grand.  This place is huge, it's located right across the street from NYNY, the elevators to the rooms were easily found drunk, wet, lost, ""wasted"", or even just bummed from losing money.
The rooms we had were CLEAN, nice, comfortable and if I wanted to complain, I might only say that our room seemed very far from the elevator area BUT I won't say that because I took advantage of their beautiful yellow lighting and snapped a few rad pictures in there.
The water was turned off in our room for about 2 hours at night and we all needed some rehydration so that's probably why only 4 stars.
The pool was ok but the lazy river thing is the best thing about MGM's pool areas.  They have a dorky pool party but I didn't go.  I can't stand this Vegas con of trying to get people to pay even more for the same thing they already get for free.  I hung out with hot girls all day at the pool fo' free mutha and I didn't have to yell over some crap house music to talk to anyone either.  Wet republic whatever.  Skip it seriously.
We brought some booze and watched the city fireworks from the roof of the MGM's self parking garage (see pictures), it was the highlight of Vegas all time for me.  I took some amazing shots up there.

I sound like a nag but this room is facing the sunset so it's naturally a bit warmer...the ac hasn't cooled anything off yet. It's been just under an hour. We have a show tonight that we are seeing and if the room has not cooled by then I will speak to a manager. My advice, don't stay in this dated hotel. Stay down toward the middle of the strip in the cosmo or cesars.

**Revised**
Came back from the show and the room cooled. Possibly due to the sun setting. Either way, it's cooled off in room which is a huge plus. Can't sleep in a warm room.

Day 2: got up and out the door around 8 am and hit the buffet. It wasn't totally bad. We went to the bellagio buffet for breakfast on day 1. Its not fair to compare the MGM to the bellagio buffet. The MGM breakfast buffet had a lot of the same basic foods that you would expect. The fruit seemed as though it was canned and not fresh. Some of the cheese had been out a while and hardened. More of a comfort food type of feel because of the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. I've found that with tempered expectations come better feelings towards the experiences. I'm not sure if that's good or bad overall since you're dropping well over 1500 but it helps to make the most of the trip. Seeing Anthony Cools tonight. Update to follow.

**Revised**
Day 2 cont: Got back from the show and met some friends that happened to be in town at the same time at the Wolfgang puck restaurant for some drinks. Service started poorly. I think do to the server getting off work soon because not even half way through our stay another server took over. This guy, named Zak, was fantastic. We only had a pizza, wings, and drinks but the server was on his game. The friends saw the MGM cirque show, KA, and had mixed reviews. I've seen KA previously and it's honestly in my bottom 3.

Day 3: Woke up and showered got ready and a smell begin permeating from the sinks. (I figured out the source on day 5). When one sink was on the other would fill with a brown tainted water. (Pictures to follow). If you've ever smelled perm solution, this scent could bring a sense of nostalgia. To us, it was nauseating. Like I said, we didn't figure out what the issue was until day 5. After getting ready we went out on the strip to go confirm show tickets for the evening. Went down to the Paris hotel to walk over to the V Theater. That's where the zombie burlesque show was being held. We came back in time for the MGM lunch buffet. It was pretty good food. Not a huge selection but the food was very tasteful. It was odd that it was around 3 o'clock and they still had a third of the buffet still dedicated to breakfast.

Day 5: There has been no other surprises except for discovering the horrific smell in the bathroom. I was brushing my teeth with the water turned on and I saw the other sink beginning to fill with water. It had a brown hue and as I got closer to the sink the smell became heavier. Checkout is at 11. It's been a very nice trip in spite of the MGM'S issues.",2,0,0

In the morning I get up to go to the gym and when I get there I see a sign that says ""our cardio room is now located in the grand spa"". No indication of floor or location. 

I get there and find out it doesn't open until 6. Seriously. There are still people at the bar I have to pass getting to the ""Grand Spa"".

-Buffett is always packed and also takes almost an hour to get into.
-We saw the cirque du soleil show and it was garbage for the price paid
-Like all vegas hotels, you may get a good booking price but the ""resort fees"" are stupid expensive and just a way to keep the advertised prices artificially low.

The room itself is not as big as the standard room and there really isn't any place you can change.  There is no separate bathroom, when you enter in the room, there is a sink, shower and toilet (with glass doors but it's frosted) so there is not  a lot of privacy.  There is a scale under the shelves by the sink so that comes in handy when you want to weigh yourself before and after the buffet.  The hallways are also very dim and it took a while to get to the elevators if you follow the signs to the 'West Wing'; eventually, we just used the main elevator.

You also have to rent the inner tubes for the lazy river, I'm not sure how much it is but someone told me it was $25.00\/day.

My wife was the winner of 2 tickets to the ACM's last April.  The package included flight as well as hotel.  We were put up in the MGM Grand and it was a great place to stay.

The lobby is HUGE with many places to check in\/out.  From the lobby you can head downstairs to exit the casino, you can head north and run into a HUGE game floor loaded with tables and slots.  

The room was awesome.  The bed was extremely comfortable and allowed us to sleep like a baby.  The bathroom was spacious with plenty of aminities. So far this has been one of the nicer rooms we've had while in Vegas.

MGM has TONS of pools.  We layed down at the first pool we ran into, then I noticed some signs pointing in other directions.  After some brief investigating, I found about 5 other pools!! I was shocked!! I grabbed my wife and we layed at a different pool which was pretty empty and had complete exposure to the sun.  

We didn't eat much while here, but there is TONS of food options around here.  Careful though, if you're on a budget, you just might end up hearing a nightly special which is a full course dinner for $200 per person.  WHOA!! 

I would like to point out that if you're a tall person, the seating in the grand gardens is VERY tight.  Not only is the seating narrow, there's nowhere for your knees to go.  I'm pretty sure they were thiking more about quantity vs quality of seating.  I mean, I did make it through a total of 6 hour of sitting in there, and I WAS DONE by the end.  

The only set back is that it's a bit south on the strip.  Granted, it's not Mandalay Bay type of south, but it's a ways down there.

So anyways, a few things: 

Reserving a room:  they don't guarantee room types and locations unless you pay an additional fee.  What the heck??  So this is how my wife ended up having a 2 queen beds room when we wanted a single king.

Parking garage:  don't forget to look around where you parked.  The garage is multi leveled and huge, and you could have a big search on your hands if you forget where you parked.

Grand Tower:   we stayed here on the Tropicana side, facing the NY NY, which was convenient in that it was right next to the casino, the Studio Walk, the front desk, and Star Lane Shops which is the direction to the vast self parking garage beyond.  The front desk was ""nice"" enough to point out that this made less walking for us, which may\/may not have been a point at us being juuuuuuust a bit on the over weight side. ha ha!

Tower elevator:  they have a small store (Front Page Newstand) next to the elevators with snacks, drinks and other traveling stuff you might need which is pretty handy.  But its not cheap and since the MGM is quite big, it takes a while to get out and walk to a place that's cheaper and I bet they count on you not wanting to do that.

Resort fee:  $18 plus tax(!!!) for the wired HiFi, $15 dollar beverage credit per visit, faxes(who still uses these?), the USA Today (that you have to go down to the Newstand for, only to find they are all gone), and some other minor stuff.   WHY IS THIS A MANDATORY CHARGE??  This is what blows about all MGM\/Mirage properties - this needs to be optional because quite frankly, most people don't use most of these services and are in effect, being ripped off.

That aside, the room was decent, aside from it not being the one we wanted.  It was clean, had a decent view of the NY NY, Tropicana and Excalibur hotels, but on the other side of things, had a tube TV, very few electric outlets , and a pitiful shower head with not a lot of pressure behind it.

The casino had a nice variety of slots and a cool horse racing machine that only took quarters.  Complimentary drinks weren't so easy to come by, despite the fact that I was sitting right next to the exit\/entrance doorway for the cocktail waitresses and pouring $20's in a slot like it was going out of style.

All in all, the overall experience here was mixed, with some good points and bad and a feeling that the care of the individual customer wasn't as important as was making sure they were processed thru like a herd of cattle.  I've experienced worse, but definitely there is also better to be had in Las Vegas, and at a comparable price.",3,0,0

There are many times where MGM can be a 5-star resort, then there are also times where it's a 1-2 star one.

For one the location of MGM is fairly ideal as it's at the Tropicana corner.  You're walking distance from Luxor, Excalibur, the Tropicana, NY NY, Hooters, and the Monte Carlo.  MGM is also the end stop for the monorail, so if you're willing to pay for the monorail tickets, you can easily get to the north end parts of the strip fairly quickly.

MGM consistently has one of the better rates for rooms compared to other resorts.  The regular rooms are fairly spacious and of fairly good quality.  Nothing really stands out from the norm.  Their West Wing rooms though are very nice.  They're almost like a mini-condo in a way, minus the kitchen.  They're very modern and are very chic.  They are however kind of small and they're kind of jammed packed together.  You can say that the walls are kind of ....errrrr....thin.  They do provide internet access, however it's $13 for 24hours.  Then again, you're in Vegas, you shouldn't be online.

Service for the most part is very average here.  I will say that one of the most convenient things MGM has, is a check-in counter at the airport.  You can get your bill finalized and your keys all before you get to the hotel.  This is a great amenity as check-in can be utter hell at times.  I've seen numerous occasions where there have been over 100 parties waiting to be checked in.  not fun.

Like other resorts it has it's share of fancy dining and cheap eats.  The buffet is average at best.  They do have KA which is an enjoyable Cirque show.  The Garden Arena is huge and a great venue to watch a concert or any featured event.

If you plan on spending a lot of time in your room, then MGM isn't the place for you, you're better off paying more for a nicer place like Venetian or Wynn.  If you use your room sporadically and are just out at the tables and partying it up, MGM is one of the most ideal places to be at.",0,0,0

I really want to give this place 4 stars, I really do, but there are some setbacks that keep it from getting a higher score. First of all, on a non-holiday time it still attracts a college crowd. The noise in the hallways (space under the doors doesn't help) is apparent. Second, the pool area is a drunken mess. I realize that Vegas is where you go to have a good time, but with all the smoking and drinking inside the lazy river by all ages it's a turn off for anyone who doesn't do either of those two activities. Third, we got a good rate on our room, but the bathrooms leave a bit to be desired. It is the biggest resort in Vegas and inside its like its own mall. The restaurant lineup is one of the most impressive things and the walk from end to end probably takes 15-20 minutes depending on how fast you move. They've made some upgrades which are nice, but I think I'd much rather visit than stay here. I know boxing is a big draw here and the new signature rooms probably attract a different clientele. Also when it comes to a family vacation MGM always goes up against Mandalay Bay. Since now I've stayed at both, there's really no contest. Mandalay is much better in value, cleanliness, crowd, rooms, etc. So if you're a parent and want to know what hotel to stay at, choose Mandalay. The price difference will probably only be about $10 and its money well spent!",5,1,2

I give it three stars for the price (even better if you have a AAA member discount) and service.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was meh - nice compared to some hotels, but in respect to Las Vegas strip, dated.  We got the Deluxe Grand Queen -- the non-renovated one.  We had asked for joining rooms, and ended up getting ones across from each other.  Too lazy to bother, as we were on a mission to hang out.  We were told to avoid the buffet here by many cab drivers, so we did.  Oh, and do not buy water or soda down in the newstand.  Take the effort to go to the ABC store next door (on your way back to the room from the strip).  A large bottle of water was 2\/$2 or a 16 oz was 2\/$1.  Much better than the $3 dollar for a small bottle at the hotel.

When coming from the airport, make sure you tell the taxi driver not to take the highway or tunnel.  Something I wish I knew.  The cab ride should be $15 at most.  Taking the tunnel cost me $27 plus tip, and the highway is even longer.

Saw the lions.  It sucked.  They were really lethargic, and just laid around.  

Its really more of a dated family oriented 3-star hotel.  For young people 30s and below, I would spend the extra 20 dollars a night and stay at Planet Hollywood or Paris where it is more central to the strip and closer to the party.  Cosmopolitan is where it is at.  The walk from MGM was sooooo loooong.  We walked the first day, thinking things were close since we could see it from our room.  Big mistake.  Taxi'd it the rest of the trip since we were a group.

Had a great room in the grand tower, one king-sized bed. 10th floor with a view out to the strip\/New York New York. Everything was clean, bed was super comfortable, and AC worked like a charm. Only weird quirk was the shower, it took 5 minutes to even get lukewarm, so I took a few super cold showers. Could have used a mini-bar or small fridge. Got a Facebook deal on the room, I'm convinced it's one of the best deals around. Rooms starting at $55? It was worth way more, in my opinion. 

The restaurants look very nice- got around to eating at Wolfgang Puck and the buffet, both of which were very impressive and enjoyable. The casino floor and entertainment- clubs, shows, were fantastic too. I got tickets for Crazy Horse and had a blast. 

The pool area is full of fun- our room came with a $50 pool credit which you can put toward inner tubes, booze, etc. The lazy river and multiple pools were nice. Wet Republic was alright, super bro'd out but fun with our group. Drinks were good (blended mojito was delicious, those expensive, duh).

Pros: 
Good size if you're here with a friend or solo. I stayed in the West Wing. If you want to avoid a long walk or you're here with someone that may not be able to walk a long distance, ask for a room by the elevator. You will be walking a long time to get to your room. My room was clean. Some things did seem old and dated like the flooring of the shower and the sink counter was peeling a little bit. There is a TV implanted in the bathroom mirror which was cool however mine wasn't working. This is not a family friendly hotel which I like (sometimes you just get tired of seeing children run around hotels lol). 

Cons: 
The noise. I heard literally every door, lock, click, sound when the people next to me open and closed their door. It was so loud that at time I thought someone was coming into my room. I'm a grandma when it comes to sleeping with noise and that's something that annoyed me. The check in process could be better. I don't expect a speedy check in; this is the biggest hotel in America with over 5k rooms. You will have to stand on line; there will be traffic in the parking lot. However, maybe check in kiosks or the option to do so online since this hotel is so big could suffice. 

Other than that, this hotel was pretty solid. I would stay here again and I don't have any major complaints.",2,0,0

We called early to see if our rooms would be ready since check in was at 3pm. They said there was no guarantee that the rooms would be clean upon our arrival, luckily they were. We had an ok view, it was blocked off by the main entrance to MGM but we could see the top of NY, NY. Since we were only there one night it didn't matter, but request a room higher up, we were on the 11th floor. The beds are so comfortable and the service is great, I called and asked for an extra blanket, it arrived less than 4 minutes later. We also received a call 10 minutes later making sure we had gotten the blanket. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Only complaint is no vent in the bathroom, this is such a pet peeve!  The MGM has a perfect location on the strip, we mainly hung out in NY, NY so it was nice not having to cross the actual street and just use the connecting bridge instead. The casino inside MGM is huge and nice. We didn't play there because the minimums were $20 or more. There is plenty of dining directly inside there as well so it really is a one stop shop. Another complaint is the ""perfume"" smell in the halls, I understand its purpose but MAN after only a few minutes I was in headache central. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely stay here again.

Tip: Don't even touch or pick up the extra items in the room (alcohol, technology kits, water etc.) we simply picked them up to look at them and were charged for a bottle of vodka and a technology kit upon checking out. We explained that we only looked at them and nothing had been opened, they said that they go by sensors on the stands of these items; once they are removed you are charged for them.

Having not stayed here before, she wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised when she arrived. She was hesitant to book at this hotel because my aunt had said that she did not like her room.

Well, we were really excited to see that they could accommodate us at about $70 for one night (about $100 total with tax, resort fee, etc.) and we decided to get the west wing type room over the standard since the receptionist said that the standards tend to be noisier.

Well, we weren't really impressed.  Having just stayed at TI the past few nights and we were really impressed, this just didn't measure up for a number of reasons.

1) The room literally smelled gross, like garbage.  We think the prior people left some garbage in there too wrong.  We probably could have asked for a switch room, but were so tired by now that we just ended up dealing with it.

2) There was no TV remote.  We called and they brought us a new one and that also didn't work.  Called again, got a new one, finally the right one.  But this took a while.

3) I'm allergic to dust and needed non-feather pillows and comforters.  They definitely did a good job changing it before we got back to our room, but they only left two very small foam pillows for the two of us.  Again, we said oh well, we were tired, whatever.

So in other words, it's not like the room was HORRIBLE, but we were just really disappointed and had to fell like ""whatever"" to everything.

MGM is hands down mine and my fiances favorite place to gamble.  It's clean, has smoke free tables (should you so choose), friendly and fun table hands, prompt cocktail service, and it smells pretty and is easy on the eyes.  

We love it here! They also offer European roulette which most hotels do not! Ask them about how to play ""neighbors"" on this wheel! We hit it 3 times in a row and walked away with around $600 and only staring with a $25 bet!  

It's fabulous here and highly recommended!",0,0,0

Didn't even give us our comp cards and meal discounts. Treated pretty badly if you ask me.  To add to it the pool was closed. Big downer for me because it was my first time there and I was really looking forward to going for a swim. If I were you I would look elsewhere.,1,1,0

Our room smelled like an ashtray and when we asked to be moved they tried to up sell us to a suite or down grade us with no credit. When I argued about this to the front desk person they disappeared for 5 min came back and again tried to up sell me. We were staying 2 nights so I asked for one night with the queen bed and the second in an upgraded suite... well it seems that we do have a room available to move you after all. Surprise surprise.
The MGM seemed old and still use tube TV's and the overall vibe was not that of the other hotels were were walking around.

My group went to their nightclub, Haakasan, last night. Half of people in our group had our phones pick pocketed. Half. The MGM management said that their nightclub is run by another company and it has nothing to do with them. The security representatives from the company that runs the nightclub said that it had nothing to do with them, that Vegas is a ""transient"" city and they can't protect you in their property. And that they were sorry we ""lost"" our stolen phones. The MGM and Haakasan both blamed someone else and said there's nothing they will do to help us. Beware and avoid both properties because if anything happens, they will not be there to help you.


Hey, MGM. I see you replied to this with a canned response. Please contact me with a manager's email or phone number after you share this incident with your team. Thanks.",2,1,0

The staff are very friendly and accommodating. They let Pat G. and I check-in at 10am and upgraded us from a standard room in the Grand Tower to a BUNGALOW SUITE! 

The view outside our window was not breathtaking, but I loved our room. The style is modern, but very classy and none of the decoration was tacky. There was an extended living space that included a sofa, television, coffee table and chair. The bathroom was HUGE with a separate tub and shower. What I enjoyed most about this hotel was the POOL area (5 pools, 3 whirlpools, river and waterfall).

It's a beautiful hotel and offers a variety of restaurants,  shops and services.   We've never taken advantage of the pool but I've heard rave reviews from other guests.  The spa is wonderful. The buffet is great.  Emeril's makes my mouth water thinking about it. You can stay here and never need to leave the hotel. 

We've stayed in several room types from a standard King Tower room to a Suite with and without a jetted tub and each trip we've had a really nice visit.   Any problems we've encountered (loud neighbors,  a TV not working,  keys not working) were attended to quickly and efficiently by the staff. 

The reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 is that we seem to consistently have issues with our billing.  Most of the promotions they email out and we sign up for have a ""resort credit"" included with the rate.  In 2014, we stayed at MGM three times and each time,  we had a different billing issue.  Only one of those times did we receive the full amount of our resort credit,  due to misinformation given to us at check-in. And believe me, we asked about the right way to use it. The first time,  we even asked for bill correction before we left and they emailed us an updated invoice.  Then someone reversed our credit out and  charged our card. I had to call back a couple days later when I saw it on my credit card and sort it all out.   If they will just get their billing together, MGM has it going on. 

Fix it before June 2015 , ok",2,0,0

The only negative thing from keeping this a five star review was upon check in, they gave me two double beds instead of what I had booked. They said it was based on availability, I understood but still did not think it was right. The next morning I called down to the front desk they got me another room with the king size bed and a city view.  

I had a BLAST here, Poker here was the best. Thats where I spent all my time. I stayed for a week and could not have been more pleased with the staff.

Was here for a week for work and staying in the West Wing. As soon as I walked into my room (14-511) I was greeted by the restroom.... no really...you walk in and see the wash basin. Super weird. After unpacking I discovered the drawer right under the TV was broken. Called up housekeeping...but they told me to call up maintenance...seems like this is a pretty regular occurrence as no one sounded surprised. Since I was barely in the room and out for work the entire day, I would have ignored all this if the bathroom had proper hot water. Not only was the water pressure terrible, the water was barely lukewarm. Again...calls to housekeeping didn't do much. 

Compare this to the Aria or the Cosmopolitan which have stellar customer service.... MGM in general seems to have a pretty lackluster attitude towards their guests. 

The place itself is a meandering maze...it takes at least 7-10 minutes to get to the elevators from your room. 

Pros:
3 Starbucks cafes - one is hidden behind the ""Show tickets"" booth opposite Centrifuge and always nearly empty
The Food Court - labeled as ""The District""  - so you can get a bite without breaking the bank.

I recently stayed here for 3 nights and had a great experience from the time I walked in the door. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. I was seriously impressed with how professional everyone was. That's one of the main reasons I gave them 5 stars. I felt like everything I needed was taken care of. My room was newly remodeled in lovely modern decor. I did wish they had a balcony, but I know that's not very common in Las Vegas. It also would have been nice to have a separate mini fridge (besides the minibar) for food I wanted to eat later. I suppose I should have asked about that. The bed was amazing! I got the best sleep I possibly could, while in Vegas. If only I had a bed like that at home!! But for some reason the casino and hallways were always freezing. I'm from Phoenix, I can't handle that! 

I also loved the pool. It was huge with a lazy river, volleyball and waterfall pools all packed full of people having a good time. I went two days in a row and never wanted to leave! 

They also were so nice to hold my bags when I checked out and had some time to kill before heading to the airport. (Super close to the airport which is a plus!)

Overall I really had a good time staying at the MGM Grand. It was really close to lots of other hotels I wanted to walk to and even though there was usually a line for cabs, the wait went by very quickly (they were also legit and trustworthy cabs). I would definitely stay there again if I was going back to Vegas!!",1,0,0

It has everything you can want and need without having to leave. Tons of food options ( low and high-end dining) , a ridiculous pool complex complete with a dope lazy river and who can forget one of the most popping nightclubs in LV aka Hakkasan. 

If you rented a car, do yourself a favor and valet it. The self park is towards the back and really is a waste of time walking back and forth especially when you're here on vacation. 

I booked an executive queen suite ( the old bungalo rooms ) which has plenty of room and a short walk from the front lobby. 

The floor usual gets popping during night. Most dealers have a happy disposition and make table games enticing to join. The remaining look like death took over and wonder what they've done with their lives. 

The only thing better then staying at MGM would be staying at the Skylofts at MGM.

The one thing I do not like is how the overall hotel is laid out concerning the casino floor and generally finding your way around. Now, I realize they do this on purpose but yet this hotel seems more confusing than most in its general layout. All of the rooms were fairly up-to-date and no major issues did order room service they quoted an hour in delivered within that hour. The pool looked like the place to be although from your room it's a hike. To give you a sense of how big the property is, I believe I counted four Starbucks within the property itself. They were having quite a bit of construction and some of the restaurants that you would normally eat at were closed. We did eat in a couple their specialty restaurants and those will be covered in a separate Yelp. Overall would I stay here again? If it's up to me and I'm booking the room, the answer would be no.

We stood there in line while each person checking in took at least 20-25 minutes each.  I felt bad for the front desk staff, because I know that guests can have their individual issues, but that wasn't the case here.  Whenever a guest had a question the front desk person would seem to call a supervisor over, and the supervisors looked pissed off and uninterested in engaging the guests.  People would ask questions of the staff and were just shuffled off to another line.  When we finally checked in, we were told that our room would not be ready in at least an hour.  The reason for the 2 stars and not 1, is that the front desk worker gave my wife and I each a $15 voucher for free drinks at one of the bars in the hotel.  We checked our bags in and were told to call back in an hour.   When we called back they told us that our room still wasn't ready and to call back in 30 minutes and when we did they told us that it still wasn't ready and they gave us a different room.  We were told to go up to the room and a security person would let us in.  We were finally let in and told to call the bellhop to get our room keys and bags brought up.  Finally the bellhop came with the keys...no bags...another wait. 

The Room:  The new room we were given was right across from the ice machine.  Paper-thin doors and walls.  Decent view and comfortable bed, which contributes to 2 stars rather than 1.  Why they had a glass door on the door to the toilet I will never know...not sexy.  The room looked like it was furnished by IKEA.

The Casino:  Shiny, but that is about it.  Decent machines.  They have lions in an enclosure, and I kinda just feel bad for them being so close to all of the obnoxious tourists taking constant photos of them.   Okay restaurants, buffet was cheaper than most but nothing special.  The staff speaks English...some of them do.  Don't get me wrong, it's just that when you need directions....English helps alot.

It's massive size makes it difficult  -- or at least time consuming -- to navigate. Everything is so spread out due to it's large footprint. The self parking garage is large and a long walk to the hotel. If you're dining there you'll want to give yourself a good 10-15 minutes to walk from the garage to the district. The district is a long hallway with many of their restaurants like Shibuya, Fiamma, Craftsteak, Pub 1842, Emeril's and their food court. Farther down the hallway is the entrance to the MGM Grand Garden arena, the monorail stop, entrance to their pools, and the walkway to the Signature hotels.

The pool area is great whether you're there to party or just hangout with family. I think the addition of Wet Republic has helped keep partygoers in one section while leaving a more laid back crowd to the other pools. They've got about 4 or 5 separate pools, hot tubs, and a mile long lazy river with a small shallow splash pool for the really small kids. The lazy river section opens at 10, expect many people to wait by the gates to get the best seats. There are plenty of great seats available so you don't have to be first. Inner tubes are available for rental for $16 each. Food and drink service is available so you don't have to leave your lounge chair until you have to pee or hit the water.

I hate  to bother you, but I have sent the below letter to the resort and unfortunately, I never heard back.

I was wondering if you could forward this to someone within your company that would be concerned about the below experience.


Dear Guest Services:

I enjoy coming to Las Vegas for concerts, fun, gambling, etc.

Obviously, there are lots of choices to stay, dine and gamble.

On Friday night, we planned on attending the Green Day concert for which we purchased tickets months ago.

Due to the proximity of restaurants and gambling to the concert venue, we chose gamble and dine at your hotel.

We chose the Tap House for our dinner.

The dinner was great, but I must say, the service was mediocre at best.

Luckily, we built a lot time to dine before the show, as our server disappeared and we waited 20 minutes to get our check. You know, we could have bought a few more drinks also.

But that is not the reason for the letter.

Since we did have extra time, we decided to play some slots. I will admit we are not big spenders, but we like to play anyway. 

We were playing outside what seemed to be a waitress\/bar service area, as there were waitresses going in and out.

While playing, we were waiting for a waitress to come take our drink order.  However, it was impossible for them to see us as they were not actively and purposely not looking around. Hence it was impossible to see us.

We waited 20 minutes and I finally asked 3 different waitresses to take our order.  We received rude treatment and comments from,"" hold on"", ""you already have a server in your area"", and ""I don't believe your server is not waiting on you"".

Now, there is a difference between poor service and being called a liar.

I really do not appreciate being called a liar, but did not have a chance to talk to someone in charge since we waited so long, and ended up being late for the show. And to be honest, we felt management really wouldn't have cared

I realize that paying penny slots is not where you make your money, and because of this I treat waitresses accordingly. I normally tip big out of the gate, so they know that although I am not a high roller, I still appreciate good service.

We would not mind giving the MGM and M life chain of hotels another chance. In fact, we headed down to Mandalay Bay after the show and we treated nicely.

But as this point, we feel like we really are not wanted and are in a quandary of where we should plan are next trip.

I went to Las Vegas for the UFC fight in May 2008.  The fight was great, the hotel stay was great and service was ok.  If I wrote a review on the MGM Grand within three days after I came back from my trip, I would've given them 4 or 5 stars . . . until they overcharged my credit card account.  Then all hell broke loose!

I noticed that my credit card was charged double the amount that I was supposed to pay.  The problem was that I took the option up to pay for everything upfront rather than letting them charge me on check out.  Apparently, the check out counter guy charged me again for some reason even though I told him that I paid for the hotel rooms already.  

Now the problems arose.  I had to speak with about 15 different people in their customer service to get the money credited back to my account.  It took almost 3-4 weeks for them to figure out what happened!  I think a bunch of monkeys could've figured out what happened in less time.  

My last word of advice to you is that if you stay at the MGM Grand, just pray that there are no issues that come up with the billing.  If that is the case, be prepared to call in many times and repeat yourself over and over again until you get your money back.  Check your account once you get back periodically to make sure you are not being overcharged.",0,0,0

1- We were there for our honeymoon. My husband tells me after we've already been there for awhile that he actually requested for staff to have champagne and chocolate waiting for us in our room upon arrival- there was nothing!

2. IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON! and all we got was a basic room.

3. Even the cheapest of hotels provide basic things like a coffee maker\/robe\/ usable mini fridge for the room- not the MGM grand. Don't expect any of this if you stay here.

4. The ice machines on our level were consistently out, so we had to travel to other floor levels for ice. And needing ice in the first place is all because the mini fridge provided for the room is stocked full of their expensive snacks with sensors that charge you if anything even gets moved out of place. So, the little ice bucket provided is what we had to use to keep our drinks cold.

5. sheets that weren't fully cleaned. Our bedroom sheets definitely had some stains that we did not create!

For future reference, I've been told that when you check into a hotel and state that you need a mini fridge specifically for medications, they have to provide one to you, no questions asked; so this can solve one of the problems, but not much else!",3,1,2

The rooms were redesigned over 5 years ago but when you upgrade from your average room to the ""king"" or better, you will appreciate the room and layout.  

This is one of the few higher end Hotel that are Kid Friendly with a Rainforest Cafe, Emeral's, and the Stage Deli which I really like.  They have tried to change their image from a family destination to a young hip crowd but there are still areas where kids are welcomed.  The adult entertainment is much improved here with Club 54 and high end restaurants so there's a bit for everyone.

The MGM is a nice hotel worthy of 4 stars in every sense.  When staying here it is hard to leave the hotel because everything you need is contained within the Emerald City.

A was a bit darker than most of the hotels on the strip as far as decor but still eye candy and lots to do. I had no idea how much walking I would have to do just to get around. Bring walking shoes for Vegas, the hotels seem endless!! Our room was great and very roomy. The beds are ultra comfy and my hubby and I wanted to take the bed home with us. I slept the best I have in months due to the bed. The lions were a nice touch to go see on a daily basis too. I was there for a week but just started figuring out my way around. Next time I'll know. There is so much to do just in the hotel you wouldn't have to leave for a few days. We're not gamblers so we didn't spend time in the casino, it was smokey anyways. We were there for a work conference for my hubby. The staff was very accommodating and friendly as well as helpful. Treat yourself to Cirque du Soleil's KA that's right in the hotel, it was worth every penny!! We did get discount tickets through the hotel, they had a summer deal going on so we got them for $55\/ea. I think we picked the best show. It was nice just getting back on the elevator and going back up to our room when it was done. We're not huge buffet fans so we didn't try that but we did go to Starbucks daily (there are 5 of them in there!) Studio Cafe has great food as well, had 2 meals there. I would stay here again but may try other hotels in the future. 

Get yourself a bus pass for only $7\/24hrs right outside the hotel near the M & M store. The bus only takes exact bills and prints our your ticket. Ride up and down the strip as many times as you want. You will also find a discount ticket place right near the M & M store as well so don't pay full price for any Vegas shows.

We loved Las Vegas! Rent a car for the day and make the drive to the Hoover Dam (45 min) or Red Rocks about the same. It's so worth it. Don't pay for a bus tour, it's super easy to get around especially with a GPS. If we had more time we would have driven to the Grand Canyon.

Room was great, I was on the 11th floor of the Grand Tower, room was spacious with all new furniture and other amenities. I'll admit the view wasn't much to look at but I had a grand time playing with the automatic blinds.  The king sized bed was huge and ridiculously comfortable, it felt like I suck right in.  Bathroom is also very modern and unlike most hotels, the shower heads are high letting water fall down on you instead of hitting you in the neck like some places.

Casino is good, they allow smoking but most places do in Vegas so you just have to roll with the punches. I will say my one complaint with the casino floor is it would be nice if they had more than 4 or 5 crap tables. As somebody who likes to throw the bones, I would like a few more options.

I love the sports book, I spent an entire NFL Sunday kicking back and enjoying all the games displayed over the many monitors.

Food options are plentiful and for the most part of good quality.

Staff is good, took forever to get checked in because of an issue with the website I booked through but staff was patient through the process and gave me a decent food credit for the hassle.

Here are the reasons why:

1.  The standard rooms are large enough for me and my friends to pre-party in.  
     a.  The bathroom had just one basin instead of two--my preference as this arrangement provides more counter space.  
     b.  The blinds completely block out any sunlight which allows me to sleep-in undisturbed.  
     c.  While most other large casinos on the strip have long hallways and you may get stuck with a room at the far end of a long hallway.  MGM's layout has about 6 hallways that radiate outwards from the elevators.  With more hallways, the hallways are shorter and the walks are shorter.

2.  The casino is busy with gamblers earlier in the morning than others on the strip.  While at Caesar's, Cosmo, etc, the crap tables are usually dead at 11am.  It is common to find a couple crap tables full with players during the mid-mornings.

3.  Even at night, the crap table minimum bets are low.  Most of the MGM crap tables had a minimum bet of $10; by contrast, other strip casinos would have only one $10 (it is common to have $15 minimum on the strip and no $10 tables) crap table going...

4.  They have a decent pool party--Wet Republic.  WR is overrated but is still a good pool party.

5.  There are lots of dining options at MGM.  While they are tons of better options in Vegas.  Within the hotel itself, the food selection is quite diverse--there are 15 - 18 different eateries to choose from.

6.  The casino is near the airport.  You can see the runway from the hotel room.  By taxi, the airport is less than 10 minutes away.  I usually get a rental, and there is a gas station at the corner of MGM so I can fill up my tank there and head to the rent-a-car center...

7.  The MGM arena is a great venue for concerts!  Large arena with possibly the best acoustic system on the Strip and a very large display screen behind the stage.

While not a perfect hotel, it has enough positive points to make me want to return and stay here....",11,1,8

This experience occurred in March 2009:

The hotel booked my party into an occupied room. We opened up the bungalow suite to find luggage, underwear and other sundries strewn about.

I was then booked into a smoking room, although my original reservation had specified ""Non smoking."" According to the concierge on the room phone, I had ""approved"" the smoking room at the front desk. A bald face lie.

I was booked into a third room with no view: staring out at the roof HVAC. Nice. Furnishings and appointments were very modest for a hotel of this reputation and expense. Neither TV remote worked in this room. It took one hour for someone to arrive with a functioning remote.

I called concierge to get information on the health club. I was told it was $10. I went down the first level and tried to find it: no signs for health club, so we went to the pool. Two staff people, including a supervisor, had ""no idea"" where the health club was and didn't attempt to find anyone who did. We walked upstairs to the spa, and found it there. The nasty spa attendant snapped that the fee was $15. I told her that the concierge had said $10; she just shrugged her shoulders.

I complained to the management and was comped into the health club. I went to the MGM Grand Buffet  that evening. It was a standard buffet, and  about half of it was turned off. They have serving staff dole out portions to you like you were Oliver Twist. Cheap.

That night we heard absolutely everything in the rooms on either side of us, including coughs, chatter, yelling, door slamming and more. 

We were out of the room for the entire second day. Returning to prepare for the evening, we found the room unserviced. Called and complained to housekeeping.

The margaritas we ordered in the casino were awful. 

With the many choices the Vegas strip offers, I couldn't imagine staying at this overpriced, overrated facility a second time. If you like the casino, I suggest just staying anywhere else nearby and just walking to it. There's a Motel 6 just two blocks away where I'm sure you'll at least get clean linens.",5,1,1

Don't expect security to do a thing about it. I called four times in forty minutes and security never once showed. I got ""upgraded"" at the airport to a ""Grand Queen Premier View"", which apparently means ""sharing a door with 20 people throwing a loud rave in the next room over."" Screaming, shouting, thumping hip-hop beats--literally all I heard. I have stayed in hotels from here to Pattaya Beach, Thailand and I have NEVER had this issue. The only reason I did not stay at the New York New York as I normally do was because they are under construction and I was afraid I would have to deal with excessive noise. HA! I will never stay at the MGM Grand again. Lobby looks lovely, rooms look fantastic...customer service and soundproofing, however, are a ZERO.

Update: Security finally showed up. They made at least six prostitutes leave the room. This thankfully put an end to the matter, but it is worth noting that the pencil-junk throwing the 'party' was warned at least three times about the noise and that at that point they didn't even bother to throw him out. I don't even need to bother adding that there was an odd smell coming from his room that I could detect through our shared door.

I had upgraded to a suite, which was well worth it for the size, and the view. The bed was comfy, and the suite was very spacious. Unfortunately, this is where the problems arose. First, the initial room was not cleaned yet when I got up there (though they told me it was), but they moved me to another room and issued me a food credit, which, of course, I happily accepted. Problem two, later on that night, when I was getting ready to go out, EEEK!!! No hot water... For three hours. That was even more disappointing, running in and out of the shower stall to not freeze to death (exaggerating). They were very slow to fix this, and not really apologetic for this issue.

The resort is kept very clean, housekeeping is friendly and efficient, and the location is right in the middle, kind of, of the strip, great hotel, although due to my experience, not my favorite.

The Avenue Cafe was way overpriced, but the service made up for it. Luckily too, there are two Starbucks in here, one close to the pool, and one close to the lobby. If you consider yourself a foodie, or just like good food, you may want to consider other resorts, because there's just not many good offerings here.

About 14 of my friends stayed here for about 4 days over the summer and we had a great time. The rooms weren't over the top luxurious, but they were clean, spacious, our beds were made everyday, new towels on request, and we didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it. The architecture of the place isn't has grand as the Bellagio, Wynn, etc, but it has a charm and style all it's own. 

The customer service here is fantastic. We had no problems getting what we needed in the room, and getting it quick! They even mail out some documents that I needed to get out pronto for me. How cool is that!?

Everyone mentions the Lion Habitat, which is great, if you've never seen a Lion before, but wasn't very magical or amazing for me...But maybe you'll get lucky and see one of the lion caretakers get attacked!!! http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oTmVo1JLV_g Now that would be amazing!! Haha

The pool area is great; The lazy river is nice to just sit in and grab some drinks, enjoy the sun, and the company. The bad part about the pool is that is super far away from the hotel rooms. Basically, takes about 15 minutes to walk down there. So if you get too drunk at the pool you might need help getting back to your room.",1,2,1

Restaurants\/Shows Available: 4+ stars
West Wing: 2 stars
West Wing bathroom stalls: 0 stars (see below)

MGM Grand is a decent casino, with lots of great restaurants, but there are definitely more Ed Hardy wearing types on this end of the Strip.

Don't let them talk you into a room in the West Wing, even if it has a king bed.  While quiet and great for sleeping, it's hard to know what time it is and we felt like we were on the Battlestar Galactica.  The hallways reminded us of the corridors they used to show on the X-Files...dark government hallways, dimly lit, with little spotlights all over the carpet.  It wasn't until we were about to check out that we noticed that the laundry bag\/notes\/envelopes\/pen all had a secret government theme.  Top Secret, Confidential, Confessions, Lies, etc...were printed on them all.  We had a little laugh at that - coming all the way from DC just to stay in a secretive government themed hotel.

I didn't mind it in the end - we got used to it - plus, the standup shower was huge and pretty great (despite the adjuster on the pole for the secondary hand-held showerhead was missing a washer\/gasket and held together with part of a bar of soap).  But with some ingenuity and a hand towel, we were able to position it so it was like having 2 showerheads.

The one thing that we never got used to, though, was the bathroom stall.  It was adjacent to the shower, made out of smoked glass, had no fan, and any little sound in there was majorfly amplified.  You could even hear little movements in there despite a loud TV.  And it was creepy to go to the sink\/mirrors while someone was in the bathroom because you could kinda see them sitting on the pot.  So for a secretive government theme, the bathroom was a serious privacy FAIL.

I'll come back to MGM Grand for the restaurants, and maybe even for a little blackjack, but I won't be staying there again.",1,1,0

Since we were going the weekend of the iHeartRadio festival, the hotel prices on the Strip were very high. I found the best deal on the mlife.com at the MGMGrand. I got a Petit King room for 104 a night! When we got there, I skipped the long check in line cause I was an mLife member, and the concierge upgraded our room to the Grand Tower, to the 26th Floor with a Strip View and upgraded it to a Grand King Suite when I told her it was my birthday!

The MGMGrand is where all the action is. It's located pretty much in the center of the Strip and many events that people come to Vegas for happen here. The hotel is beautiful, the pools are nice and the cocktail waitresses are plentiful and generous in the Casino.

There are a few Happy Hours in the restaurants were you can get moderately priced food and do some interesting people watching. The Fish House this time was not that great.

In addition, we did hit the mlife casinos in Monte Carlo, Bellagio and Aria as well and we had a splendid time getting buzzed while we played!

If you remove their crap from the mini bar they immediately charge you for all the items. They refused to remove alcoholic items from the room and there was a non working lock on the bar.

They will charge you a $50 restocking fee if you put any personal items in the mini bar.

A puddle of liquid was left on the floor. I'm currently recovering from a dislocated knee injury and thank goodness I had a brace on, otherwise my knee cap would've fully moved to the side again. During the fall, I did feel my knee cap move, but the brace basically prevented it from going too far. However, my fall at MGM may have prolonged my recovery process. Before my fall, another lady slipped and fell. When she went to go fill out a report, she saw me fall and was shocked that it happened to me also. My husband tried to file a report with someone at the front desk and they told him a supervisor would come and meet us. We waited to file a report and no one came for about 45 minutes. They then sent a security guy instead, not a supervisor. The security guard wanted me to go over to some other area to fill out the report, but by this time, I was tired, annoyed and concerned for my 2 tired, young kids who were waiting all that time to leave. One of the employees also had said that if we leave, it's like it never happened. Wth? Then show some effort and concern that I fell! Honestly, it felt like they were purposely just taking their time and were hoping for us to just leave so they wouldn't have to deal with us. This hotel should've at least pretended to care and apologize for the slippery mess that caused me to fall and possibly re-injure myself! Customer service is awful!

This hotel is always ""poppin"", and 4th of July weekend was insane.  If you're as big a fan as I am of people watching, then you're in luck. 

I didn't have to bother with the check-in process, someone else in my group handled that, so I cannot speak on that aspect.  We'd driven in from the Phoenix area, arrived around 5pm, I dropped them off at the front door to check in, and by the time I'd parked they were calling me from our room, so that was pretty fast IMO. 


Hotel...

lobby: 
Huge, bright lobby with large TVs over the check-in desks.  The TVs are usually playing music videos (to my delight, as I prance-dance through the lobby).  The large boxing ring, which houses a large gold lion statute, is a popular attraction for photo ops.  If you want a photo of the Lion in Ring sans a million strangers in your backdrop, I suggest getting down to the lobby before 8am...while everyone else is still hungover and asleep. 

Note: It was freezing in the hotel hallways!


Workout facility:
on the 4th floor, if I recall correctly.  You'll need your room key to enter.  Nice, clean, simple little workout room.  Lots of treadmills (I didn't count them; maybe a dozen?), stair-stepper, and other equipment. It was well stocked with lots of clean towels, and it had 2 filtered water coolers.  


Rooms:
Follow the yellow brick road (overhead signs) to the guest rooms.  From the lobby, take a quick right, walk through a short hall (cupcakery to the left, convenience store to the right), until you reach the rotunda with the large fountain in the middle.  From here there are different pathways, above which you'll see where they lead.  Proceed accordingly.  (FYI If you are told to go to a room, for example, 401, do not assume it's on the 4th floor. Verify which floor, b\/c there is a (for example) 401 on all the floors.)

We had a room on the 10th floor with 2 queen beds. The room was spacious, but not as large as the room we had here last year. Same comfy beds though!
I'm not sure why the bathroom being at the door is such a focal point for some.  With as many people as I've seen stumbling through the lobby, barely making it to the elevator, I'd think the bathroom being at your instant disposal would be a good thing.

The bathrooms are large and clean.  I like that there is a wall separating the commode from the sink area.

The maid service was great.  She kept us stocked on extra towels.
Tip: Tip the maids a little every day ($2 per day if it's just you or +1; $1 per person if there's a group of you), especially if you're staying multiple days.  You'll be rewarded!  

The city lights can be bright at night, but they have blackout curtains in the rooms, so just close the curtains and nighty-night.  There is nothing that you can do about the noise in the halls though.  Dude; it's Vegas.

I don't watch TV when I'm in Vegas, so I don't know what the TV service is like. 
However, there was an outlet center on TV stand, which included 2 USB ports; great for charging our iPhones. 

I wish they would switch from glass drinking glasses to individually wrapped, disposable plastic cups.  Those glasses are unsanitary. 

If you call guest services to request they bring you anything, call WAY before you need it. It took them almost 2 hours to bring us extra blankets one night. 


Casino:
I do not drink or gamble.  However, it was very smokey while walking through.  I wish they'd incorporate a no-smoking policy. But I know they're afraid to lose money.


Food courtyard:
McDonald's and the pizza place (forgot the name) were open at 2:30am one night, and it was packed!

Other options during the day were Asian (think Panda Express, but the name was different), Mexican (burritos, tacos, etc), Southern USA (fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc).  Aside from steamed veggies at the Asian option, nothing else was vegan-friendly.

Pool:
You'll need your MGM room key to enter, otherwise YOU SHALL NOT  PASS.
Clean towels available, so no need to bring your own.
Arrive early for a lounge chair (and some peace and quiet). Small humans (children) take over by midday. 
Pool closes at 8pm, so no late night dips for you.
There are different areas, and they're all huge.  You have to pay extra to chill in the lazy pool. :(
I think there were at least 2 restaurants inside the pool area. I didn't visit them, so I have no comment.
You can NOT bring your own water bottle into the pool area, so when (not if; when) you get thirsty, be prepared to spend $6 on a baby bottle of water. 


Entertainment:
I went to see Cirque du Soleil's KA performance, which was outstanding!  Fun, truly entertaining, eye-catching performance.  Absolutely loved it!  The auditorium is lovely as well, and it wasn't too cold inside. There's a concession stand, but I didn't visit it.

Check-in - 3 stars. Not enough people working at the desk, lines too long, but when you got an agent, efficient enough.

Room - 5 stars - marble bathrooms, cute pictures of movie stars and the mgm lion in the room, very comfy bed and we happened to have a view of the New York New York hotel!

Concierge- 2 stars - one of the greater weaknesses. Some agents were very informative about Las Vegas, but mostly they just wanted to hook you up with super expensive shows, grand canyon tours, and restaurant reservations. That is, if you merely wanted to ask, say, how to get somewhere, they would print out some written directions but carried no brochures on them. The lines were about 45 minutes long too - since often the concierge agents were in charge of making aforementioned reservations.

Housekeeping staff - 5 stars - hardworking - we didn't have bodywash when we first got in and 10 minutes afterwards got some extra body supplies.

General atmosphere - 4 stars - It is a casino, after all, but it's quite a posh interior and a very large complex of (expensive) restaurant options, card tables, and slot machines.

I have to say I never want to go there again. What a circus. I went to a concert at the MGM Grand Areana, but you have to go thru the entire place to get there. 
I know casinos are loud and crowded, but this seemed way over the top crowded and noisy. Kids all over the place. When did this become ok? People walking thru the casino in their swimwear with no coverups and no shoes. All I kept thinking was if these fools step on glass and get hurt they will be the first to sue. Is this the new casino attire? 
A huge manaic on a scooter going very fast almost knocking folks over. Then I see this manaic at the concert sans scooter, funny he was walking fine then. 
Where are the people in charge of this asylum? Perhaps hiding?

There were issues with the conference itself but that had nothing to do with the hotel.  The Grand Buffet had very good food.   Check-in did involve waiting in line but that is Vegas for you.  I have three minor complaints.  One, service in the Lobby bar was slow even though it was not crowded. Two, the West Wing bar was never open even during posted hours.

I'll review that separately as well.  Oh, and the prices.  I paid almost twice as much for my Starbucks latte as I pay at home but again, that's Vegas!

We had a problem finding our room and Officer Love the security guard noticed us struggling and really went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help us. Both her and Nicholas provided service like I have never experienced ever before, I truly felt so cared about and special. Officer Love really went out of her way, she was with us every step of the way while we were double booked on accident. I am truly so impressed.

We thought, this will be a perfect one night of fun before we land in our final destination: Los Angeles. We booked a last minute deal on the Hotels app, we found what we thought was a good deal, it was around $90.00. We parked our two door Honda Accord in the FREE PARKING LOT, and thought this is amazing. FREE PARKING! We thought we were off to a good start. We left our car close to the entrance\/high traffic area because all of our belongings were packed to the brim in the trunk and the back seat. (Months later I found out the engagement ring I didn't know about was sitting in a box, under a guitar, in that very same back seat, in that MGM parking lot...) When we entered MGM it was like grand central station. We finally made it to the check-in desk. The lady kept trying to sell us an ""upgrade"" with a hot tub for $27.00 extra. We thought we were being cheated out of our good deal, so we refused. We followed our very labyrinth like directions to a hall way, pass the high roller room. We should have taken the upgrade. The whole lot of ""good deal"" rooms were in an area that was under construction. It REEKED of five day old Chinese food. *Don't ask how I know what that smells like.* We rushed into our room to crack open the window, only what do we find in our window, the view of the New York City skyline! No window. No ventilation. Just a florescent light image of New York f-ing City. But there was a telephone in the shiter! The next day we bought over priced bagels and coffee and watched a sad domesticated lion lay on a glass floor. We also had our hearts broken, we found out that parking is free everywhere in Vegas, and we weren't special. I will say, I am giving one extra star for having a secure parking lot - our car didn't get broken into. Yay!",0,0,0

Once you've decided to brave the place some call the devil's backbone, your lodging options are virtually unlimited..  from the stratosphere and imperial palace at $40 a night weekdays to $300 a night and up rooms at the bellagio and wynn.  The MGM is squarely in the middle money-wise.   If you sign up for their player's club card and throw a couple hundred bucks in the slots you will start getting some pretty generous offers in your email box.. this goes for most of the hotels.  Especially in this shaky economy, those rooms are just sitting there and they'd rather have you there for super cheap than staying at home in des moines watching tv and eating pizza.  Walking up to the desk and checking into a comped room is a pretty sweet feeling and chicks dig it.  

Overall i've had great times and excellent service at the MGM.  Check in has always been pretty quick and fairly smooth especially compared to their sister property the mirage.  I'd say if high floor strip view rooms aren't available, stay in the west wing.. the rooms are smaller and further away but are really nice.  When i've had an issue they are there for you (i accidentally messed up my room safe code and they were there pretty quick).  Room service is super spendy cuz they want you to ""get it on tha floor"" like DMX so yep ordering up a six pack of coors light is like thirty bucks!  There are little stores by the elevators where you can buy beer, cigarettes, bottles of liquor and other ""basic necessities"" (insert stupid internet smiley thing here).  

There's a food court with pizza, mcdonalds and a nathan's famous on the way to the pool that can save you a lot of dough on chow.  The casino is huge and great with excellent staff and the sports book is awesome.  There's always good fun music by the pools and throughout the hotel.  Somehow the tunes seem to always fit what i am up to.. I'll lose my friends and then hear ""without you"" by motley crue or find myself playing slots at 4am on april fools day to bob seger's still the same..  ""you always lost every time u placed a bet"".  Ahh the irony!. 

The biggest disadvantage to the mgm is the distance from your room to the pool - it's a serious hike. Then again the best thing about the mgm IS the pool complex.. seven pools, jacuzzis, a ""lazy river"" floaty deal and different vibes at each pool.  The 'producers pool'  has some lanes blocked off for lap swimming which is great for curing your inevitable hangover.  If you want a mellower or more lively scene.. just move to another pool!   If you want that fun, party-ish singles aqua club vibe that's hip with the fake boob crowd, the ""wet republic"" pool is worth checkin' out..so long as u don't mind hearing lil wayne and daft punk at a volume slightly quieter than the jet you flew in on.  Don't worry it's not all obnoxious like rehab sundays at the hard rock.  However it will cost you twenty bones if u posess ""a five letter word rhymin' wif meanus or cleanus"".  

All in all the mgm is a good base of operations.  It's away from the center of the strip, which for me is ok.  A cab over to the hard rock and double down saloon is less than ten bucks. You can catch the las vegas monorail up to mid-strip from within the hotel - www.lvmonorail.com.  Or there is a little free monorail that goes the other way from the excalibur next door to the luxor and mandalay bay if you wanna try your luck elsewhere, see the shark reef or perhaps catch a show at the house of blues.  

The biggest mistake that new visitors to vegas make is not having a plan.  Have at least a rough idea or two for each night you stay so you aren't just wandering around like a confused moose in heat.  Hit the bellagio fountains and some other strip attractions one night, go to freemont street the next and pick a night to go see a show or sporting event - visitlasvegas.com will list all the goings-on if you plug in your dates.  Most of all don't think that you have to do everything because you can't.  Remember that it's ok to just chill by tha pool.  Limit your gambling and stay away from tha hookers and it can be a super cheap and rad vacation!",3,2,1

I'll start with the good:

Clean room with ample room
Smoke free rooms, which aren't everywhere in Vegas
Front drive is off the strip so it's easy to get in and out of
Offers great room specials since they have almost 6,000 to sell

The bad:
Service, I had some major issues during the stay. I was checked into the wrong room type even after the front desk agent repeatedly said 2 Queens? and I corrected her no I want 1 King. She said ok I have you in a one king. I walked into a room with two queens. this is frustrating after taking almost an hour to check in to have to go back to the desk. You'll never get anyone on the phone. When I got to the desk, they argued with me that I booked two queens. I'm not a moron, I have a confirmation for a K1 in my hand, don't insult me. 
Size. Took me 4 days of exploring to even see all the place, and I think I still missed some things.
Feeling of indefference. I don't think any of the staff there really liked their jobs, as they sure as hell don't want you to feel like you're important. Oh well. I'd be upset too if it were this much a hassle to get to and from work and I had to deal with non english speakers all day.",0,0,0

The stay started with a surprising two queen bed room, when I requested a 1 king; they were nice enough to fix that (they made a point to let me know that you were making an exemption; as it was my fault). This was followed by a list of problems, that I will now list:

1. Cleaning supplies left in new room, right when I arrived.
2. Wifi not working; multiple occasions now. (I'm typing this in notes right now because the wifi is down for the 2nd night now). The support team says it will take 45 minutes.
3. No hot water in the shower! It took them 3 days to fix the hot water. (They felt extremely bad at their negligence on the matter and removed all my resort fees). 
4. They said they left me a message; however the red button you click on to hear your messages is broken, I kid you not. 
5. Room needs dusting, and windows are really dirty from the outside.
6. Forgot my razor at home; asked for them to bring me up one of theirs. I hope I'm in exaggerating when I say this; it was the most painful shave of my life. It took 20 minutes to do a shave that usually takes under 5. Each stroke, pulled each strand, opposed to cutting it. Their razor isn't to even the standard of a dollar store razor

I come to Vegas every year, for a convention; this is the first year they are doing it at MGM. Prior, it was at the Venetian, for a few years. There are certain issues that I probably wouldn't have, if I hadn't stayed at a hotel to standard of the Venetian (A+ hotel); but there a lot of things on my list that are not excusable and giving me discounts and free meals are nice but I'd rather not have to take cold showers for 3 days, or go through a painful shave, or not have wifi at night when I trying to unwind.

I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. I would encourage everyone to stay at the Venetian, Aria, or Cosmopolitan.",0,0,0

Long story short, we made a reservation, but that didn't matter. We were put in the South Tower, and told it was an ""upgrade"" by the attendant from the West Wing. Afterwards we found out where we reserved our room was better by far, so we were flat out lied to. Then in our crap overpriced room, there was no fridge, no storage, and no lights in the shower. We were surrounded by college drunks sharing rooms, with garbage and empty pizza boxes in the hallway.

On top of this, be prepared to pay a $28 per day fee, which was explained as mandatory for all guests. This is for spotty wifi service. Yes that's $28 a day for wifi. We also paid $43 for a quesadilla from room service... A single quesadilla.

This was also our anniversary. We explained this hoping to get a little better treatment, or at least a discount, but no, just a $75 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the wifi.

That just means more money for gambling, shows, and drinking.

This is one of the largest hotels on the Strip. Depending on how your night goes, it can be a long walk if  your room is far from the elevator. 

Some pros:

+Restaurants- there is a nice selection of restaurants within the MGM. For a cheaper option, checkout the Planet Pie in the underground. 

+Gambling- Like all hotels on the strip, they have a casino. Their minimum to bet are on the cheaper side in the extremely late night\/early morning, but aren't as high as what you would see at the Cosmo. If you are on the cheap side, just walk across the street to Hooters

+Shows- The MGM is home to Ka. This is one of the better shows and very well done.

+Monorail- The MGM is a stop on the Monorail. The entrance is located in the Underground.

+Location to the  Airport- This is one of the fastest hotels to get to the airport from if you some how find yourself running late for your flight.

+Rooms- They were updated within the last two years and the bedding is comfortable and the blackout curtains are awesome and work extremely well after a long night out

Cons:

-Crowd: Since this is one of the larger hotels, there tend to be a lot of people. Expect there to be a long line at the checkout\/check in counter.

-Hotel Layout- It is on the larger side and depending on your room location, expect to have a nice walk

**Tip- If you are arriving in LAS, check-in at the MGM office in Terminal 1 baggage claim area. This can save you a lot of time in the long run.",4,0,2

The lazy river was great, although we could have lived without the repetitive techno music playing poolside.  

Our room was serviceable, but not great.  We were in the extended part of the west wing, and the room felt very thrown together.   We had a single king room; it was very small and generally lacking in amenities.  No refrigerator, no coffee maker, only 1 tiny window and truly terrible lighting.  My boyfriend commented that it felt like a David Lynch movie, and not in a good way.  It felt like night time even in the morning.  You want to be able to see yourself when you get dressed to go out.

The bathrooms were the biggest challenge, though.  Very small, and completely lacking privacy.  When you enter the hotel room from the exterior hallway, you are in your bathroom.  The bathroom and the foyer are one and the same.  The shower was nice, but the only thing separating the toilet from the rest of the hotel room is a very thin glass door that doesn't close well. It feels very exposed.  Not great for a couple.  There was very little counter space And the lighting in the bathroom was honestly the worst I've ever seen in a hotel.  Very dim, green, and harsh.  The light is in the center of the mirror, so only half of your face is lit up.  Clearly not designed by someone who needs to put on makeup.

It wasn't fabulous, but it didn't suck either! It was the first Vegas place I paid for out of pocket as a poor college student with my poor graduate student boyfriend (November 2007), so it holds pretty fond memories for us :)

For such a sprawling place, it was pretty well-run.  You kind of have to get used to feeling like a little cog in a massive machine.  Service was impersonal, but fairly brisk and efficient.  We got the regular no frills room, and were satisfied with what we received.  Around 400 sq. feet, with a king bed and a cool shaped couch.  The bathroom was average.  

The main draw for us was the fact that this place is so big that it has EVERYTHING. It has a mega sized casino, with decent minimums for black jack on a slower night.  There are also tons of restaurants.  The first time we were there, we were too poor to go to anything except the McDonald's in the food court, but even their food court was fun to sit in! Open and airy, good for people watching.

I knew I was coming back to visit the restaurants once I got my hands on some cash though.  Couldn't walk through their eye-popping restaurant row without remembering it good.  I've since stopped by to try Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grille and Fiamma.  Wasn't disappointed!

In addition to a comfortable couch, we requested a (rather comfy) cot which came in handy for our questionably-sober guests. While I like marble, having the desk and coffee table topped with the stuff made them harder to move than necessary. Their pool (for hotel guests only) was fairly large and inviting; I took a much-needed nap poolside. (Oh, the now-standard ""do not use hangers here"" signs by the sprinklers amused me - who DOES that?)

Gambling? Their casino rocks, as I actually won (some) money. Table limits fluctuate depending on the time of day, so the temptation to gamble can be pretty bad (I was making table bets while walking to cash my chips). At night, parking at the MGM can be a drag, from the mad confusing valet system to the unlit parking signs.

Hungry? There are lots of fast-food and luxury dining options in-house (they have a Wichcraft!) and since they're on the southern section of the strip (near Monte Carlo and Luxor), you're near Ginseng (a Korean BBQ) right around the corner.

All in all, a trouble-free stay! I've been in better hotel rooms, but the pool, reasonable cost (for Vegas), and dining options make the MGM easy to recommend.",2,2,3

1) Pool, pools, and more pools!  The perfect place for those hot summer days, and as mentioned by others, you'll find the right one for you...watch out for vomit in the lazy river :-\    Kick back with a yummy frozen mango drink...or have a bucket-o-beer...
2) Lots of dining options - Emerils, Wolfgang Puck, decent Asian food at the Grand Wok, and lots more (2 Starbucks, McDonald's, fancy fare, etc.)
3) The lions are always a treat to watch - love looking up and seeing their big ol' paws!
4) MGM is big enough so that if you don't want to visit other casinos, you'll probably still be content just staying at the MGM (though NY NY is just right across the overpass)
5) Super quick and easy cab ride to\/from the airport
6) Good happy hour at the West End bar
7) Good comps
8) I feel at home here (because we almost always stay here)

The not-so-good stuff:
1) It's at least a 15min walk to my favorite Vegas entertainment (the water show at the Bellagio) and shopping; good 25min(?) walk to my favorite shop (David & Goliath at the Venetian); monorail is okay, but you still end up walking quite a bit so...depends on how far down the strip you're going
2) I'm NOT a fan of the Grand Buffet - don't think it compares at all to the Bellagio, Paris, or Wynn. Though they did have awesome grilled cheese sandwiches last time (in the kids section)...

The first time, I was just excited that I was staying there (my family always stayed at the cheap places). To me, this place was totally nice, but that was before I stayed at other resorts in the same price range.

The regular rooms are dated and don't feel completely clean. The TV is really  old. For some reason this bothers me. The bathroom was clean, but the shower-head was not the best. The bed is not the worst bed, but also not the best.

If you stay in the West Tower, it will not live up to the hype. Very modern looking, but the layout is strange. The bathroom really affords you no privacy - not exactly sexy if you know what I mean. The bed feels cheap in these rooms. Also, our shower, which was glass all around, was leaky, so a lot our towels went toward keeping the floors dry.

The MGM has a lot of great offers, so we usually get good rates. We also love the location, particularly because the monorail station is a quick walk from the rooms. We love that they have so many restaurants, etc., so you don't have to leave to eat if you don't feel like it. All in all, the place is massive, so it can be a vacation unto itself.

There was no TV in the female lounge, but there was one in the Men's-which I heard from my boyfriend was actually very nice, and everything was in its place.  If you can manage to dodge the many employees loitering the area it can be relaxing.  

On sat 12\/15 afternoon i got a ginger lily sugar rub- don't let the name fool you, its just an overpriced showerhead ""massage"" they throw some sugar on you, not exfoliating in the least and rinse you off for 20 minutes of the 25 minute service at a whopping charge of $85 not including the 20% service charge of $17 which stated on the price list ""has been added"" - but it's false advertisement, they add that charge later once you've been billed.

It has been about 15 years since my one and only trip to Vegas and my husband had never been. We arrived on a Tuesday and figured out as the week wore on that this is THE day to check in without lines. Check in was quick and efficient. Everyday thereafter the lines got increasing longer. So I can't speak to anything other than my experience, which was great.  

We stayed in a Grand King room in the West Tower. Our room was very nice and spacious. We had a decent view, clean room and comfortable bed. The blackout shades were great for late nights and sleeping in. The room stayed relatively cool, but a little warm under the covers. Maybe I'm just used to sleeping with a ceiling fan on at home. 

The facility is enormous and I joked that maybe we might have the layout memorized before we left. It is at on one far side of the strip and we liked it that way. The Hubs and I joked that we enjoyed watching the ""crazy "" further down the strip, but that it was nice that it wasn't right outside our door. We took the monorail that stops at the MGM to a lot of places and it was very convenient. 

We ate at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant after attending KA. Both of these experiences were great. It has been stated before and I will reiterate that they really do have just about everything you could possibly need in this facility. Lots of food choices whether you want fast food, fast casual, or fancy restaurants.   

Join M Life, it really is worth it. The Hubs and I played quite a bit of blackjack and racked up a lot of points and enough comps to make it worth our while. Concierge was friendly and helpful as well as any other staff member we encountered.

After we had a map, it wasn't too hard to get around but this seems typical of most large hotel\/casinos on The Strip.   Our room was clean and our non-smoking room did not smell like smoke.  Our water pressure was just fine.  We had a  very comfortable bed.  Yep, no flat screen but we didn't watch much TV and it didn't bother us at all.  Service was nice and friendly with most encounters we had.  We did not use the pool. Planned on it but each time we got back to our room I could not fathom walking all that way back downstairs.   KA was fabulous. The only complaint I had is that there is nowhere to sit that is not a ""paid"" seat.  The only place to sit at in this hotel  is at the slots,restaurant, buffet, bar, at a show, etc.  My husband did not notice it until I pointed it out to him.  There are no benches or public seating area anywhere in this hotel that is not in an area where you are required or expected to give the MGM Grand money.  No benches or seating area in the lobby where everyone had to stand or sit on the floor waiting to check in or out.  I started noticing it in the mall\/retail areas.  I wanted to shop but my feet hurt and I wanted to rest a bit.  My only option was to sit on the floor or find a restaurant to sit at.  I therefore, decided not to shop.

I stayed here last night for the fourth night of my July 4th weekend, but I've stayed here dozens of times over the years.  The rooms here are cheap if you book well in advance.  E.g., you can get a low end room for around $100\/night on the weekends if you book at least 4 to 6 months ahead of time.  If you book within the last couple months before your stay, that same room might be around $250\/night on the weekends.  

The rooms here are very contemporary.  My room basically looked like an Ikea demonstration bedroom.  Outside your room, you will find a plethora of entertainment, shops and restaurants.  

Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak here has the best porterhouse I've ever eaten.  You will find excellent service here.  Rainforest cafe is a wonderful family restaurant that has animatronic animals everywhere that regularly move and make sounds in the rainforest decorated surroundings.  The menu items are American food.  The prices are reasonable and Kids will love this place.

Hakkasan here has the reputation for being one of the biggest and best nightclubs in the world.  Steve Aoki, Calvin Harris, Tiesto are resident DJs here, which means you can catch one of them performing at either Hakkasan or the Wet Republic pool party at least once a month.  In the summer months, all three DJs usually perform here monthly.  I caught Tiesto yesterday at Wet Republic and had a blast.

MGM has a pretty large pool complex with a lazy river that is available to hotel guests for free.  MGM's casino has a large array of slots and table games if that's your thing.  Finally, the only downside of this place is that it is so large it feels like it takes forever to walk to anything.",3,0,2

Hier gibt es die gemütlichsten Betten im stylischsten Zimmer (alle neu seit 2012), die beste Pizza im Food Court um 4 Uhr morgens, das hilfsbereiteste Personal... vom Concierge, der dir Baseballkarten für die Triple A League besorgen will, bis zum Hausmeister, der dir anbietet, das billigere Wasser aus dem Automaten für Mitarbeiter zu besorgen.

Aussicht: grandios, egal in welche Richtung. Poollandschaft: gigantisch, mit Wildwasserpool, für den man sich Schwimmringe leihen kann. Und es gibt einen Erwachsenenpool, kein Kindergebrüll hier, wenn man es nicht möchte.

Drinks: für Zocker natürlich umsonst

Frisör\/Stylist: der Hammer, aus mir wurde eine Anwärterin für America's next Topmodell!

Buffet: all you can eat - and you'd like to eat even more. Das Angebot der Superlative. Sieben Mägen müsste man haben!

Shows: unfassbar gut (z.B. KA von Cirque du Soleil und David Copperfield).

Comfortable and one positive was to take the stairs towards the rear elevators.  At the ground level it's a short walk out the door onto the strip or the other way is the sports book.

Check-in was very clumsy, with the front desk clerk trying to push for an upcharge to check us in early.   Took about 10 minutes for him to explain that if we wanted to simply pre-register, we'd get a call when the room was ready at no extra cost.

Spent $145 total because of their pay to park garage, ridiculous resort fees and TWO taxes. ""Resort Fee Tax"" AND ""Room Rate Tax."" 

Our sheets and pillows did not get changed. Looked like the housekeeping folded the blankets and that's it. Didn't even bother to notice the dead skin, hairs, and makeup on the bed. Disgusting. Also, there was stuff on the floor - somebody went shopping and left tags on the floor, there was literally toilet paper on the ground in the bathroom, and toothpaste on the ground. 
We checked in on my phone about 6 hours prior to actually arriving, and received an email notifying us that our room was ready. To me, this is a ""check the box"" thing where the housekeeping was either blind or no management oversees quality assurance and said ""Yeah sure they can come in now."" 

Granted, this was resolved after calling the front desk but by this time it was 1030 pm. Not how I wanted to celebrate my anniversary but oh well. Won't be staying here next time.

We received a room on the 20th floor in the grand tower. The room was a spacious and mostly clean. There was some dust in places obvious to us while laying down on the bed so this was probably not obvious to the cleaners. No problem. 

The bath room was huge! The shower had different settings which was nice. 

The view of the room was nice at night with all the lights of the different hotels nearby but during the day it really just overlooked a roof. 

The hotel itself is again huge but well sign posted so we only got lost a little bit the first day.

I travel the world for work and I wouldn't expect something this seedy unless I was in a third world country.  So far I have been staying here for over two weeks. I was put up in a west wing room this time. The room VERY small and outdated, but that does not even begin to describe how horrible my experience has been. 

At least once a day while I walk though the hotel (I only leave my room to either get food or go to work), I've been approached by people selling drugs. Yesterday morning there were hookers going door to door asking if anyone needed some morning company. They asked me if I wanted them to come with me to my room for a ""morning session"" while I was walking down the hallway to get something out of my room before going to work. I told them no... they kept yelling at me and pushing it. I continued walking and stopped responding to them, so they went back to knocking on every door in the hallway. What if they knocked on a room occupied by young children or newlyweds? They were literally going door to door while housekeeping was in the hall and nobody did a thing. By the way, this was at 10am.

The elevators from the west wing exit into the west wing bar. There are literally homeless people sleeping on the couches there. I can't walk though it without being asked for money or if I want drugs. Did someone pin a sign on my back or something? Is this a joke?! If I walk outside of the west wing bar doors, there are homeless people and crack heads that swarm me asking for money.

I haven't stayed at the MGM in the past two years and never in the west wing. Either the MGM has gone completely down hill, or the west wing has always been this seedy. I will never stay at the MGM again. I feel like I'm in a shady motel on the wrong side of town.

The hotel appears to draw a much older crowd and features tons of gaming area.  Since it's one of the older casino and hotels on the strip, they have expanded in size!

Their basic bottom of the line rooms are a bit motel like.  Why?  You have your sink located separately from the rest of the restroom.  These basic rooms in the original towers are a bit on the older side and unfortunately it shows.

If you have a rental car, you are forced to park in the very back, walk through their really bad mini-mall and into the casino.  It's a bit of a walk, so be prepared.

The pool is pretty good and really enjoyed it.  That is probably the best highlight of the place.

TIP: If you stay here, may sure that you do not reserve a standard room unless you must!  The MGM now has 4 brand new towers which are really timeshares rented out the the public.  These rooms are comparable to what you will see at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay and has a modern edge to it.",3,0,1

After waiting in an obscenely long check in line, we were informed that our room was ready (thankfully).  We got upstairs and the room was awesome (I've uploaded photos of our suite\/bathroom).  Our initial booking was a deal that came with a $75 meal credit towards any of the MGM eateries.  The room itself was spacious and clean and had zero trace of that awful smoky smell you can't escape in the actual casino downstairs.  I didn't see any sign of construction in the casino so I assume they're done with all that and the lion habitat won't be coming back but I'm not 100% sure.
The room was at the end of a very long hallway which provided for a nice seclusion but a pain in my butt when I was wearing heels or needed something from the ice\/vending machine.  There was a room across from ours that seemed to be quite full or having a party but once inside our room, there wasn't much noise infiltration so the soundproofing was pretty good - very important to a light sleeper like me!  Also helpful so the finicky sleeper were the awesome remote control window shades in sheer and blackout so you could filter out most\/all the light from the 2 giant windows.  And the remote control panel was fun in a James Bond kind of way.  The room had a decent sized flat screen tv and hook ups for your computer (usb, etc) built into the desk as well as a large L-shaped couch, ottoman, and a large bed...I think we had a king.  There was ample drawer space and 2 safes in the room.  There was an easy to use iron\/ironing board in the closet with plenty of hangars.  We didn't have a fridge but I saw a note saying you could ask for one.  The bed was awesome, but the pillows were not my favorite.  They had some give to them but unlike a memory foam pillow, they didn't really spring back much they just kind of deflated under my head..but like I said, I'm a very uptight person about sleeping habits.  
The bathroom I never wanted to leave!  I'm fairly certain it's bigger than my entire bedroom.  It had a huge vanity counter with double mirrors and a storage shelf underneath.  The toilet was partially walled off and the shower and tub were adjacent but not connected.  The jacuzzi tub was awesome and didn't take long to fill up at all.  There was a rain-style showerhead in the shower with great water pressure.  The towels were nice and soft and everything in the bathroom looked clean.  
One of the afternoons we were there a maid actually came into our room without knocking so make sure you put the DND sign on the door if you want your privacy and there are no chain locks on the doors so tilt the handle up once inside to lock out people even with a room key.  There was one day we left the room a bit on the later side and took the sign off to have the room cleaned but no one ever came.  Thankfully they'd cleaned the day before when we'd left although I thought it was weird to realize the cleaning lady had been watching our tv in our room because the channel had been changed to a Spanish one and the tv had been swiveled into a different position.  
We had some issues with the internet and the front desk was very apologetic and sent someone up which fixed it instantly.  Due to the trouble, they added an extra $25 resort credit to our bill.  Then we had an issue charging to the room at one of the restaurants so they added another $25 credit.  We had an issue as well with my bf trying to charge the room to his credit card but the hold on it was larger than what they put on if it's a debit card (oddly the opposite of renting a car) so he ended up having 2 pending charges on separate cards and had to have the credit card company talk to the front desk guy to get one of the holds removed which was a bit of a pain but again...$25 resort fee.  Not bad really, that means we essentially got $150 taken off our total bill at the end.
Also the concierge was super helpful and friendly when we bought our tickets to LOVE.

The bed was very soft and squishy. The lamps were touch-activated, which is very cool. 

The West Wing also has its own bar area, which was nearly empty every time we cut through.

You drive here from Phoenix, you fly in here from New Orleans, the absolute last thing you want to do is wait in a line for over an hour to check out.. Right? They know its busy 24\/7.. They know their occupancy up front, so it should be fairly simple to have the appropriate amount of desk agents to accommodate the 300 plus people standing in line right? This isn't their first rodeo, This is like groundhog day for the MGM.. Every Day, and every Hour, tons of people wait in a ""Are you Kidding Me"" size line to check in, you need something at the Bell Desk, You need an extra Hotel Key, whatever it is.. You are going to wait in ""Disneyland on New Years Eve"" sized lines with very little staff on.. Their were six agents checking in well over 300 people.. Not to mention Valet..They will hold you hostage for thirty minutes at the Valet here.. We just self parked, and hired sherpas to take us the 1\/3 of a mile to our room from the Garage.. The MGM acts like they truly do not care..Hands down my worst experience at a Las Vegas Hotel.. Next time, I'll go with what I know.. Aria, Wynn, Trump, or Venetian next time..",0,0,0

There is was no microwave or coffee pot. In addition too, they charged $50.00 for storing items in the refrigerator in the room. There is only one place on each wing where you can get ice. When taking a shower, the water does not drain so my first shower was full of soap scum and dirt because the tub has been been cleaned. At night they must turn the air up because it was extremely hot in the room. There is no ventilation in the bathrooms either.

To add injury to insult, the hotel charges an additional $200 fee for incidentals that is refundable. That's okay, but an additional deposit has been made for the first and last night of the stay as contracted by my group reservations. So why as for an additional monies? I will never stay here again and would advise others to do the same.

After meeting on the floor, we all went up to their room to catch up while they had some drinks. 

On the 14th floor, their room was located down what seemed to be an endless hallway straight out of a psychological thriller type movie. Upon opening the door to their room, they were excited to show us the TV screen above the sink. Not sure how many people need a 6""-ish TV screen embedded in the wall by the sink, but cool.

Walking past the sink\/bathing area, we got to the main portion of the room. There was a decent sized, and comfy bed against the windows, a stylish leather chair against one wall, and a desk with a chair against the opposing wall, next to the 'closet'. The layout of the room may have had some bearing on the sensation that the room was very small and cramped. Most Motel 6 rooms are more spacious than this room. It was nicely appointed, just... cramped.

+ Despite being 20 yrs old, this resort\/casino is always changing and building new concepts to keep fresh and maintain their lead in the market.

+ They built the most expensive, best nightclub in the world in Hakkasan.  Not only did they build it, they also signed some of the top DJ's in the world to exclusive contracts to play in Vegas.

+ Their Wet Republic pool parties are one of the best in Vegas.  We look forward to every pool season.

These new points are in addition to the points in my prior review.  Whenever we come back to Vegas, this place is on our list to visit.

We spent the night at the Grand King room located in the West Wing, which faces the south end of The Strip. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons.

Pros:
- Front desk service was quick and hospitable.
- Complimentary 1 hour late check-out extension.
- Updated bedroom and bathroom area.
- Bed was comfortable.

Cons:
- Check-in at 3 p.m. was 15-20 minutes worth of standing in line.
- Disneyland-like lines in the elevator lobby; it took us more than 5 minutes each time we wanted to head back up to the room.
- No blackout curtains in the room to block out the green, glowing ""nightlight"" that illuminates the hotel's exterior.
- Thin walls.
- Boogers on the bathroom walls and on the towels -- if those weren't boogers, then what else is crusty-looking and green?
- Pieces of potato chips were found on the floor.

You can see every type of person here, and there are plenty of food and drink options.

Other pluses include being able to walk right into the monorail station and being close to the legendary lazy river.

The gym was amazingly packed in the mornings, and 3 of the 15 treadmills were broken. Not the best gym experience, but if you're strategic with timing, you can get every type of machine you want.

The bathroom was extremely spacious which I loved. What I didn't like was the fact there was no microwave or fridge, I get that this is how the strip hotels get us to be big spenders at the restaurants and buy elsewhere. 

The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The Express Check Out feature helps save time when catching a flight or shuttle bus. 

A negative complaint here is the poor restaurants and Food Court. Avenue Cafe, Starbucks and Nathans are not enough options for breakfast.  PUB, Fiamma and Tacos and Tequila are just not adequate.

I always said a good way to judge the casino you are in is by how hot the cocktail waitresses are. Cosmopolitan and Aria probably have the hottest ones in Vegas right now.........MGM ...ughhh.....not so much.

I swear 2 years ago MGM was my favorite spot. I would come in here for hours just hanging around. Loved the hotel rooms. The reason I come here still is that I just feel like I win more money in MGM than anywhere else. 

To be fair I do see that MGM is doing a lot of construction. They were doing it on my October 2012 trip and still were on my december 2012 trip. I go back march 6, 2013 so I will see if they are done by then. 

MGM is just run of the mill right now. Lame clubs and bars. Pretty basic casino. Took out the lions cage. MGM has been the biggest disappointment lately. A couple of years ago this place used to be packed every night. Now it only gets packed if there is a UFC or boxing match going on. I really think that Cosmopolitan just stole all of MGM's shine.

We originally had booked a West Wing King through Mlife, but a day or so later they sent an offer to upgrade to a Stay Well King for only $18 extra a night so we took it. 

The first issue came at check-in, although admittedly, it may be my own fault. When I booked through Mlife, I could have sworn it said the resort fee was only $18 dollars instead of the $25 it looked to charge elsewhere. We even commented to each other that we would have an extra $14 to gamble with. Once I upgraded my room, my resort fee said $25 a night, but I figured I would clear it up upon check-in. When checking in, the front desk attendant said he had never heard of anything but $25 being charged. It made us question our own sanity as we were sure it said $18 when we originally booked. But again, maybe we just read it wrong. However, when we got to the room we decided to check it out online, only to find the resort charge was now $28, which only made it seem like the front desk clerk was lying to us. 

The 2nd issue to me was the $200 room security deposit that was not mentioned a all while booking. That would probably be something you want to tell your guests before they arrive, and honestly is $200 the casino didn't get from me as I had planned to blow through all the money I had transferred into that bank account. Well, in hindsight, maybe they did get it from me because I have yet to receive my security deposit back from them. Still waiting. 

The third issue, and a minor one, is the remote control only worked if you pressed the buttons with the force of a thousand men. Annoying yes, but manageable. 

The fourth issue, and probably the most inconvenient and troubling was that our toilet backed up and overflowed onto the bathroom floor for no apparent reason. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. About 30-45 minutes later we had to call the front desk again and ask if they were going to send someone up so we could use the bathroom. They said they couldn't guarantee when someone was going to be up to fix it. Someone finally came about 20 minutes after the second call and plunged the toilet but did not clean up the floor. They said they would send housekeeping to clean it. Housekeeping never came, and the mess around the toilet remained throughout the rest of our stay, which fortunately was only another half of a day. 


One the positive side, the bed was nice and the blackout curtains worked.


We booked at the MGM for the experience, but afterwards we regretted not saving the money by staying at Hooters. We expected better, and MGM certainly left quite a bit of emptiness in our weekend.",2,1,0

We had a reservation for a room with a King size bed and were told upon arrival that the room we already paid for was sold out, so we were ""upgraded"" to a room with two queens.  Not sure how sleeping in a queen bed rather than a king is an upgrade for a couple, but okay.

Then we discovered large brown stains on the comforter of one of our beds.  Nice.

What's worse is our sink was clogged when we arrived, so brown dirty water has been sitting there all day.  Spoke to three people at the front desk and a manager, and it still hasn't been resolved.  Aside from being a huge inconvenience, it's an obvious health hazard; no one here cares.

Save your money and spend it elsewhere.  We have one more day here and might miss our 9:30 show because it's 8:00 and I'm still waiting for either a maintenance person to show up or for the manager to call me right back with the update she promised half an hour ago.

Approaching the casino from the Strip, there's graffiti, broken fixtures, homeless people hanging out in front begging for change, and general grittiness that most of the casinos on the strip don't offer. 
But they do offer the best sports betting environment on the Strip. They have a huge area to watch any sport conceivable, with complimentary betting books, and a giant display showing the scores and odds on the various upcoming games. The betting area was a bit dirty, with most of the areas to sit being surrounded by empty drink glasses. 
The minimums were a lower than some of the Strip casinos, but I had a real hard time understanding the dealers' English. They knew how to deal, but didn't know how to explain the game, or speak clearly for that matter. 
It's cool that the main lobby has all their boxing memorabilia. It's cool to check out the old fight's gloves and outfits. There's some real boxing history at this place.

When I booked online it didn't say anything about incidental charges and if its in writing somewhere I certainly didn't see it.

I've been here an hour and I already feel like I need my review started because there's so much already going through my head. Not in the best way either. I liked the fact that ""check in"" was right through the door instead of like some places where you get dropped off and have to go on a mission to find where you check in. You walk in and there it is. Despite it being 10:00pm there was a line to check in. It went so quick though. Plenty of people working. I have no complaints except for the fact they charge $200 for incidentals. That's quite a bit. I got totally lost trying to find the ""Grand Tower"" because the instructions I was given at the front desk were horrible. Other than those issues check in was fine. My room is on the 10th floor room 516. This whole place is a maze. When you finally find your tower you have another mission to find your elevators! Once you find those and get to your floor you come a circle and in each direction going all around is a series of hallways. Once you figure out what hallway to go you end up going down and hallway never ends it seems like. I felt like I was walking the green mile or something. It took forever to get to my room. The ice machine is located in the ""300"" hallway so you have a quite always to get ice. I think each hallway should have an ice machine at least halfway down because there's about 150 rooms in one hallway! 

The room is so small. The other hotels I've stayed at have larger and more cozy rooms. They have the ""bathroom"" to your immediate right when you come in. The vanity area is very small. They have the toilet in a little room by itself kinda like its a public bathroom. Next to it is the shower. The shower is awesome though. Great water temp and pressure and very spacious. The TV has a lot of channels but the signal goes out quite a bit which is annoying. The bed though OMG! It was like sleeping on a cloud. So comfy! The pillows were great. I had a king bed with 4 huge heavy pillows that you melt into once your head hits them. The mattress, the sheets and the comforter were so soft! I loved that bed and I wanted to take it with me. I will admit as my stay went on the room grew on me a bit. 

The casino was huge. It took me a couple of days to start figuring out where everything was and still found myself getting lost at times. Plenty of places to eat and a wide variety of table games and slots. Plenty to do. They closed the pool on one of the days and it figures it was on the day I planned to enjoy the pool after my spa visit. It was a little rainy out and they closed it over that! Very stupid and dramatic if you ask me. I also loved the fact that in the lobby of my tower was a 24 hour convenient store with all the odds and ends you might need for your trip. Gambling here was great and I met some awesome dealers. Specifically Vic and Niegel. I would come here again just to play at their table.

I've stayed here before, once for my 21st birthday when it was being renovated, and in the Signature Suites in 2011. The latter and this present time were crowded, but the room fit five women with suitcases and lots of hair. The second part of our group stayed higher up, in the 20s, though they had a view of the strip and only three women with lots of hair. Sleeping arrangements were determined prior hand, and though Ms. Bonilla may have been disappointing there was not cuddling, the room did what it was supposed to in Las Vegas - shut out the light and let us sleep. 

I don't always expect the world from a hotel - I want clean white sheets (who doesn't?), clean towels, a working flat screen, and to be left alone. Everything else I can either find or bring myself - and in Las Vegas, you can do both, depending on your desires. Literally. The hotel is large, at one end of the Strip, so you have to walk a lot to get anywhere else, but again - know this prior, and you'll be happily drinking (and eating if that's your thing) to your heart's content. 

I was. And then I went upstairs to my room, and slept it off. Or go to the pool. That one is amazing, and one of the best on the Strip.",3,0,3

That came in handy because all the restaurants are pretty upscale and expensive, even the ""cafe"".  I counted something like 3 different Starbucks.  The buffet doesn't measure up to the Tropicanas, go across the bridge and eat there for less.  I'll echo what other people have said and point out that the MGM hotel is maybe just a bit too big to really enjoy staying here.  I liked my room, the only thing missing that normally I would expect was there was no coffee\/tea maker.  I got my share of sun by the pool and floated in the lazy river.  Convenient to the Tropicana, NY\/NY and Hooters (I had an awful dinner at Dan Marinos).  It was too hot to really explore more of the strip.",0,0,0

4) No coffee maker in room. Even cheap, sleazy hotels have coffee in the room. Does MGM need money that badly? 
5) Fridge in room is only for selling things. You cannot store your own things or you will be fined.

Normally I don't like staying on this end of the strip - I've been spoiled by rooms at the Venetian you see - but when going on the dime of a company, you go where they tell you.  Curiously, I had to pay for Sunday night since the conference didn't start until Monday.  It was only $110 so I didn't think it was that bad.

I had a room in the West Wing or whatever they call it, not the Tower rooms.  That wing of the MGM has seen better days for sure.  I had to walk down probably the longest, coldest hallway ever to get to the elevator to go up to my room.  There were stains all over the floor - luckily the dim lighting hid it a bit.  OR you could walk through the West Wing bar and then to the elevator.  

The room was A-OK though.  It was decorated in a throwback 70s style sort of.  The bathroom had glass sink and shelving all in one piece, but also had separate shower and toilet.  Everything had glass doors though and even if they were frosted I'd say you'd better be pretty close to your roomie before you start lathering up.  I was absolutely FASCINATED by the TV in the bathroom - it was inside the mirror.  Yes, completely flat inside the mirror.  I watched TV every time I got ready just because I thought it was so funny!  The light was completely embedded in the mirror also.

Speaking of mirrors, there were a lot of them in the bedroom part of the room too.  The entire closet and also the wall beside it was mirrored.  A retro chair stood over to the side.  The bed was huge and was so phenomenally soft and comfy with feather pillows.  MMMM so good when you come home tipsy and want to pass out.  I liked that it was positioned far away from the door so that no noise from the hallway could reach you while sleeping.  I didn't like NO mini bar, the stained carpet, and the fact that some of the molding around the bottom of the room was cracked off and no repairs had been made.  Made it look a little shabby.  But hell, are you even in the room anyway? 

The casino was ok - slots were not very loose (insert Beavis and Butthead laugh here).  Bartenders were friendly.  Food court had some decent fast food options (Nathan's hot dogs, some Asian place with fresh meats that you picked out, pizza, McDonald's, Starbucks) and there were fancy pants restaurants too.  The conference center was also a decent size and they had a large ballroom for large events (free Foghat and Kansas show?  Yes please!).  I really liked the Centrifuge bar where you could play video poker, drink, listen to bangin' tunes, and watch the hot bartenders dance on the bar.  The pool looked fun too (even if a chemical spill did cause problems just 2 days before I was there) and I hear Wet Republic is the bomb diggity so no problems there.  You can also take the monorail from here to other casinos in the area.  They even have a few stores for shopping, although not very many options so go somewhere else to buy an outfit.

I think MGM Grand is A-OK for a reasonably priced room where you can crash while drunk.  I'm not going to be clamoring to stay here, but if I am paying my own money I might consider it.",3,3,3

We checked in pretty quick and were able to get an upgrade to our room.  We stayed in the main hotel which was nice.  The room was really big and clean.  We had a nice view of Las Vegas including the mountains.  This hotel is very HUGE so ask questions if you can not find anything as the staff here are very helpful.  There were a few Starbucks in this hotel which was a score as there is not a coffee maker in the room!  The resort fees gave you access to their gym which is only the ""cardio room"".

We checked in on June 27 and checked out on June 29, 2007. The $20 trick is a bribe to give to the front desk in order to get an upgraded room. Now, it all depends on who's working and when and where, but I asked my dad to do this. But did he do this, NO!! He asked for an upgrade and had to pay $20 per night, which was $40. OMG! Well, enough of that, on to the rooms.

We ended up going from a regular room to a Celebrity Spa Suite on the 17th floor. The size of the room was alright. The king bed was oh so comfortable. There was even a mini fridge and safe. The room was clean and we had nice toiletries, including lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. 

So, after staying here, I wouldn't stay at the MGM Grand again. It's one of those ""Have to stay at least once"" hotels. Only if a room is less than $60, we might go back.

STATS
Celebrity Spa Suite 17th floor, Room 17250, 2 nights, $90 per night with upgrade.

PROS
-Location on the South Strip
-Comfortable room and atmosphere

CONS
-Long walk through the casino (not that it matters for a 18 year old like me)
-A longer walk from Valet to our actual room, which was situated at the far end of a hallway.
-Spa was too small
-Floor can get slippery in the bathroom (My dad fell after getting out of the spa.)

The MGM Grand was a nice and clean hotel, with a great pool and atmosphere and you can't beat the price. They also had a offer, where if you got the MGM Grand VIP pass, which you put $500 on a card and you have to spend within MGM Grand Hotels, you got other special offers and discounts which in the end was actually very helpful, as we were able to get half price tickets to some shows, we were able to get a free limo to the airport, and got discounts on all the food we ate.

The biggest drawback from this hotel is that it's like staying in a Maze. I was constantly asking myself where I was the first couple days until I got my bearings straight.

The Room View that we received was of the roof of another part of the hotel which wasn't that great, but the room itself was very nice. The TV in the room was a very nice flat screen TV.

The Food within the MGM Grand is good, which is what you get when you stay at a Huge Hotel.

Even though there were multiple starbucks within the Hotel they were always ridiculously crowded and the lines weren't really worth it.

The Spa at the MGM was very nice, and very very accommodating. I had my girlfriend go and get a manicure and pedicure while I gambled a bit, and she was very happy and when I went back to the Spa to meet with her it was if she had known the people for years, they were very friendly.

The Pool area was very nice, and the bars were very conveniently placed, so you really didn't have to wait for a drink long at all.

I would recommend this Hotel, but for the first couple of days have a hotel map handy.",1,0,1

It's better than the Hilton in terms of location and room quality, but way, way below Mandalay and Wynn. Of course, you'll never book a room at Mandalay or Wynn for less than $100\/night (which is what we paid here at MGM) so I think for most people this is a moot point.

PROS:
-Location: South side of strip with monorail in building. If you want to drive, the parking lot drops you off on Koval which runs parallel to the strip. 
-Price: Cheap and great rooms for the price. 
-Infused Water: Due to long check-ins, they set out infused water. Citrus and pineapple. Win. Sadly these pitchers disappeared after a couple days.

CONS:
-Size: Easy to get lost and not too close to the strip, depending on where you're staying. 
-Parking: Getting to our car took 15 minutes! 
-Check-in line: long. Really long. Mind you, it was a holiday weekend.

This has been my fourth stay at the MGM Grand. Our first visit was in 1984 in the old MGM before the hotel burned to the ground. This was our third stay in the new MGM.

When we first arrived, there was a very long wait at check in. I mean, really long. Reading other reviews, this seems to be an ongoing problem they need to work on. Once we reached the front of the line, the person attending us was very well trained. He apologized for the wait, and seemed to go to great lengths to find something to suit us. He found us a room, even though it was before check in time. He said he was trying to find something facing the strip - but we would have to wait. But, he had a suite available that overlooked the mountains. We wanted to check in, it sounded nice, so we checked in and took the room.

And, I posted a couple of pictures of the room - it was very nice. There were electronic shades - both sun shades and room darkening. There was a large comfortable bed. There was a second room, a sitting room. The room had a nice sound system and flat screen TV. The view was nice - first the Hooters Casino, then the airport, then the mountains. Not exactly a gorgeous view, but it was certainly nice. Forgive me if I sound a little sarcastic, but as I reflect on all of this it seems that the excellent training received by the check in person was to help make people feel as if they were treated better because of the wait. 

The hotel and casino is enormous. Aside from the large rooms, the amenities are huge. It as too cold to go to the pool, but we did get a look at it, it looked wonderful. The casino is very large and well lit. There are lots and lots of slot machines. I was amazed at the amount of penny slots not just at this casino, but at all of the ones we visited. Tables were generally crowded, starting at $5 and going up. It was kind of fun watching the high rollers. But, I'm not much of a gambler, so I enjoyed people watching.

And, what people watching there was - the weekend we went, the MGM hosted the UFC championships. There were so many people, so many different kinds of people. If you've never been to a UFC event, yes - there are lots of tattoos and lots of skin tight clothing. But, there is a huge variety of different types so you can't really stereotype here. The events themselves were really expensive, so we didn't go to any. But, from the folks we talked to, it seemed the fights were great.

There are a number of places to eat in the MGM Grand, but most of the ones that are comfortable are typically very expensive ($$$$). We did enjoy several of the Starbucks in and around the MGM, and had one lunch at the Stage Deli (a counter with tables).

We also got the chance to see Brad Garrett at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club in the ""basement"" of  the MGM Grand. The theater is really nice and the comedians that performed were great.

The overall experience was great. The service was outstanding and the accommodations were A #1. We've been there four times. If I can stand to take the noise and craziness of Las Vegas again in the future, we'll be back for a 5th appearance at the MGM.",4,1,1

Crowd - Busy with a younger crowd, doesn't feel stuck up.

I wish I would have spent an extra $10\/night to stay at a suite at the Signature. Who knows if that would have been any better? When we got to the room the light to the bathroom area would not turn on, we tried the breaker and it was shot. The area was  pitch black, so we couldn't get ready to go to the nice dinner reservation we had planned. Later on in the night we ended up just eating at Emerils in the MGM right before they closed. It took an hour and half for the electrician to get up to the room. It took me three times to call to get him up there.The bathroom is right there when you walk in and is the first thing you see, which is unexpected. There is only one small junky sink, the water took a long time to go down the sink and it is gross when you spit your toothpaste in it. Other cons: the towels had brown stains on them, the wall was coming apart to the left when you walk in, the wall to the left on the bed had a brownish red drip like stain on the wall (looks like it could have been wiped off, but housekeeping failed to do so), the carpet area directly under the tv was stained black, the cheap drawers underneath the tv were chipped(?????), the bed had stains on it, there was only an outlet on one side of the bed, and the shower was old and stained, the glass door to the toilet kept slamming hard (we were afraid that we were going to break it and be charged up the you know). Housekeeping: I put all the towels and glasses and empty bottle\/trash together on the table for housekeeping to take and clean up. When we left for the day, housekeeping has come by, but left all the trash on the table!!! This room needs a remodel bad, with all the income MGM brings in that shouldn't be a problem. I usually stay at the Mandalay and have no issues, the room was cheaper this weekend, so it scares we to think that they would have stuck me in a shitty room as well.

I come to vegas for the restaurants, shopping, atmosphere, and nice hotels. I have never stayed at such crap on the strip. I have to believe the Grand has better rooms, I just got unlucky with one of the crappy party rooms. I am willing to pay a good amount, but I expect a good room.

We've been coming to the MGM for roughly 20 years now - alot has changed!  Remember when Vegas fashioned itself as a 'family destination', and MGM had a theme park, and the Vegas strip courted gamblers from around the world with the best gambling rules\/odds?

Well thats all changed, some for the good (no kids, yay!), to very bad (worst gambling rules in the US at corporate Strip Casinos)

So this trip, we were encouraged to use the 'mobile check in' by several emails.  After going thru this very tedious process (having to get my credit card out twice and filling out multiple pages of info), it tells us to 'wait for an email' before checking in.  Said email fails to arrive even two hours AFTER I stated we'd be arriving (we were a bit late).  So stand in line for about 10 minutes, we check in, luckily the gracious gal voluntarily moves us up from the 4th floor (!!!) to the 8th.  That way, we'll have a nice view of the ugly MGM gravel rooftop and air conditioners.  I'm not expecting much for $200\/night, am I? Anyway, we walk away and I go 'SNAP!' I forgot to ask about the whole dang paid-parking thing, so I go back, wait in line AGAIN....and a different clerk says 'Oh!', give me back your keys, they need to be redone for parking in\/out privileges. Use the key at any MGM resort.  Parking is $10\/day plus tax unless you're Pearl Mlife or better.  Add that to the nearly $40\/day resort fee (after tax)

Okay, my usual resort fee gripe: this fee allegedly includes internet access; yet, internet is offered to ANYONE, guest or not.  So its not a benefit.  I guess we're actually being forced to pay for all the freeloaders using the internet at Hakkasan.  So, for $40\/day, you get (wait for it): fitness center access.

Thats it.  No one needs 'free local calling'.  No one wants to use your boarding pass printing service.  One might think parking fee would be included in the 'resort fee', now THAT would be an ACTUAL benefit.

Anyway.  The Room.  Still the same after several years, things are aging.  Notably, the once electric motor driven window shades are now hand operated with a chain, they removed the ostensibly failing motors and took out the neat control panel for them.  The shades are kinda crooked now.  And the inroom ripoff mini-fridge cheerfully advises that we better not touch it or use it for our own purposes; if you want a fridge we'll bring one up for $25\/day.

The TV works great.  There is a pretty cool A\/V control panel with HDMI inputs and USB charging ports.  Beds, super firm (i.e., barely slept the whole stay).  Pillows, firm as well.  Bathroom big, well lit, makeup mirror.  Of course no coffee pot, but I have a big suitcase that my little 4cup coffee pot fits in quite nicely.  Two nice chairs, coffee table and a desk with a good chair.  And weird giant artwork on the walls.  Overall, nice.

The pool here is fabulous, lazy river, several pools, palm trees.  I like the music pumped in from Wet Republic.  Great staff.

The Casino:  Sadly, 6\/5 Blackjack disease has invaded here too.  The main casino is ALL 6\/5.  There are a few 3\/2 BJ tables in the high-rent section (but early weekdays you can find $15min 3\/2).
Video Poker is as bad as it gets; 7\/5 JoB and 6\/5 Bonus Poker.
They DO have one 'single zero' roulette wheel in the high rent section, and craps is 3x4x5x, so that earns the casino a stunning:
1.0 star out of 5.0 stars (see table below)

Casino dealers are top notch in my experience.  Every interaction with hotel staff was terrific.
The TV Checkout finally worked! 

I'm a gambler, and MGM doesnt want real gamblers anymore.  I have to play off-strip, and I guess I'll stay off-strip from now on.

I've never tried staying at MGM signatures, I usually stick with MGM grand which is pretty awesome. If you get upgraded to one of the staywell rooms, you get free day pass access to the spa as well, which is pretty great for recovery after all the partying.

The rooms itself are decent sized. I love the bedding in the stay well rooms. The rooms are decently clean although theres not much of a view. 

The pool though, is amazing. I love the lazy river and there's always great music if there's a pool party going on at Wet Republic.",3,0,1

I did only have one issue with the second stay.  When I got to my room from checking in, the hallway smelled like weed.  I entered my room and was instantly hit with a wall of weed smoke.  It was coming from the room next to mine. 
I went downstairs and they briskly changed my room with no questions asked. 
While staying here I played many games (slots\/tables) and found the accommodations very pleasing. Lots of variety in regards to gambling. 
Many places to eat to choose from.

Which, for some, can be considered a curse rather than a blessing. The second best is (or was) the poker room. I'm not sure about that anymore because I haven't played here since before the cowboys came to town and they relocated the poker room to put in a stage area for NFR events. I sincerely hope this is just a temporary adjustment.

The first thing I noticed when I walked through the door was the overwhelmingly fragranced air. Not good. It smelled like perfume mania in here. Yuck. After tending to the business at hand I had planned to buy-in for some Texas hold'em and enjoy a meal here. My plans were immediately changed due to the fact that I was light-headed from trying to hold my breath. The smell was that strong. The second thing I notice was the rodeo crowd. There were LOTS of cowboys in proper attire ever ready for a tip of the hat. 

I headed straight  to the players club as I was here for business not pleasure. After a minimal wait I received great customer service. I was attempting to redeem my Mlife points for show tickets. Even though I didn't get exactly what I wanted the staff was helpful and appeared to do all they could to fulfill my request. Unfortunately, their new players club is not as good as originally advertised as the accumulated points don't travel between MGM properties. Points earned in the MGM poker room can only be redeemed at the MGM, in MGM eateries. They cannot however be redeemed for Lion King tickets at Mandalay Bay.

I wasn't feeling well, so after waiting in line for about 30 minutes (not too bad considering the length of the line) we paid $30 for early check in.

As soon as we entered the new room, we were hit with the smell of an ashtray.  Honestly, the person before us must have been chain smoking.  We called the front desk, and they said they would have someone bring up an air cleaning machine... Fair enough.  Fast forward several hours later, we come back and the room is still bad.  The maintenance guy says that they will have to clean the carpets to get rid of the stench.  Long story short, their system is down, so they couldn't move us to a new room.

In the end, they agreed to take off the resort fees and half of the room upgrade charges... This came to nearly $200 on a 3-night stay (the resort fee is murder).

In contrast to closed circuit fights at Aria where they do table seating that is much more comfortable and accessible.

The price was pretty affordable especially in June where vegas seems to be a popular destination. It ran for around 100 a night after all the fee and taxes. The checking in line was pretty long but eventually was able to get through it. The checking out process was very easy. You can just check out on the TV in the room with a few buttons. They also provide luggage storage if you check out early and don't have a flight till late at night. Free service but of course.. tips recommended. Parking was free for people who was staying at the hotel but i believe if booked in June they started charging $10 per day because of busy season. 

The room itself was spacious enough for two people but the bathroom and bedroom was pretty much in one room. The bathroom wasn't in its own room which is I guess weird for some people. There was no fridge or microwave where I was expecting at this popular and known hotel. Room service cleaning was random at times... one of the days we didn't even get the room cleaned for whatever reason. It was a pretty peaceful setting for a hotel that is usually filled with youngins trying to party it up in vegas. 

The casino itself is big and plenty for play. I did end up going to see the jabbowockeez, home to MGM which they were GREAT. ( find my jabbowockeez review for more information). Also saw that there was David Copperfield (Magic show) and some circus show also available at the MGM grand.  Hakkasan and wet republic usually have the higher end DJs but the club settings are mehhh compared to the other clubs you can find in vegas. 

Overall a good experience but not a great or excellent experience staying at the MGM grand. Will probably try another hotel on the next visit unless MGM grand has an offer I can't resist.",9,3,4

First night, I check in, get up to my room and there are used fake eyelashes on the floor. YUCK. Then, the drain in the tub was stuck closed so I could take a bath, but not a shower. It took me calling 3 times for anyone to come up to fix the issue. Next day, switched rooms. Second room was same size, but with chairs instead of a couch. Ok, cool, that wasn't a big deal. 

Ordered room service for breakfast one morning, and it took 2 hours to get to our room, and then was so bland and flavorless that I didn't want to finish eating it despite being super hungry. $86 for a horrible breakfast... ugh. 

So, then we booked a massage appointment and tried to move it when our plans changed. They charged us $300 to cancel the appointment... on top of the actually cost of the massage. WHAT?! EXCUSE ME?? Imagine my shock when I open my credit card statement and see an extra $700 charge!! Not ok. Thankfully, they have since reversed the charges since there was no video of us signing a receipt in the spa. 

The people watching was fantastic, and overall I enjoyed my stay. I think next time I visit Vegas, I'll try a different hotel though. 

There are a bunch of bars and restaurants within the hotel, ranging from $-$$$$, plus shows and a world class club (Hakkasan). We easily could have stayed just on MGM Grand property for several days without ever seeing the sky, as there's just that much to keep you occupied.",3,1,1

They have a casino on the first floor, shopping places, and a big concert hall. I have been a couple of times to see some artists.

Cons:
- Annoying $67 resort fee charged for the weekend (3 nights) that did not appear anywhere on Expedia
- Huge...  too huge - it's a long walk from one end to the other, and getting from the elevator to the rooms on the ends can be quite a hike

We ordered couple of burgers, I ordered chicken, shrimp, & steak pho, onion rings, fries, & buffalo wings. I was so surprise at how good the food was, my pho was so good, it came with all the veggie toppers. Everyone said their burgers were so juicy and perfectly cooked. The onion rings were sooooo good and the fries perfect too!!

This time...checked into room that smelled like marijuana and had trash on the table. Hot tub had dirty film. Oily fingerprints all over cabinets and sticky spots near TV. Spoke with manager who comped us $100\/ waived resort fee but the room was not cleaned nor were we moved to a clean room. 

Second day: housekeeping asked if we wanted room cleaned which I replied yes, room was not clean when we returned in the late afternoon. Spoke with manager who increased the comp to $150. Room was supposed to be cleaned while we were at dinner which did not happen. At this point, gave up on having a clean room. Housekeeping eventually came and our room was clean at 10pm! 

When I arrived back in LA, looked at credit card bill; ended up getting charged for meal WITHOUT any comp AND the resort fee. Had to call my bank and credit card company to settle everything which took about 3 hours. 

Also called a few numbers to try to speak to higher management at MGM. Spoke to about 5 people before someone actually apologized and said she would email the corporate office about our experience. MGM seems to think comping their customers is the solution to the problem...the solution would have been to clean the room when we complained or move us. We will never stay at MGM again.

The MGM use to be one of the ""best hotels"" on the Las Vegas strip but boy have they changed! Booked a room 6 months in advance, got to the hotel waited in a 1.5 hour line to check in and was given a 3rd floor room facing a wall. They moved us the next day because the room was so bad.

We got a new room but the room still sucked for being booked so far in advanced and arriving on a Wednesday. The hotel lacked ""Las Vegas"" vibes and was outdated for the most part in the lobby, casino, etc.

I filled out a customer satisfaction survey and asked to be contacted about my stay. No call. I called them, they didn't care to resolve my unhappiness much. I go to Vegas often and won't be staying here again. Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Vdara, and even Excalibur are better choices in the future.

And if I saw one more sign about ""Top Golf"" I would have freaked out. I get it. You have golf.

I also had many packages shipped to MGM's FedEx store. 2 of 3 packages arrived. The 3rd ""arrived on Monday"" after I had already left. My tracking showed that it arrived on Friday and they just couldn't find it. They charged me $20 to get the package shipped back to me and no one would help. By the way, the package total value was $30. It took me 5 phone calls, 3 emails, 2 hang ups because they don't know how to transfer a call, just to try to pay the $20.

Well to be honest, I have no idea how to write about anything in Las Vegas. I don't go to clubs, or play poker, or go to shows... So here it goes, with the 3 things I do do...

ROOM: K well lets see here...I've only been to Vegas 3 times...1st I was 15 and hated it (stayed at Mandalay Bay)...2nd time we stayed at Motel 6, across the street from MGM, so MGM was our main source of entertainment. This time, we actually stayed in an MGM room, 7 people in a double. The BF and I ordered a cot, and attempted to share it...which was very uncomfortable. The beds looked comfortable, and our room had two tvs and two showers for some reason. I mean as far as hotel rooms are concerned, Ive been in better, and Ive been in worse. Definitely comfortable enough.

CASINO: I only play slot machines, and bet on horse racing. I like the Enchanted Unicorn 1cent slots by the lion exhibit. Although I won $50 here last time, this time I wasn't so lucky. The horse race betting area is a great place to get free drinks and waste a couple of hours.

POOL: EW...I mean I guess when it's 100 degrees out, the only place to go is the pool. Which means all the dude-bros and such pile into the pools that the MGM has to offer. I mean it was Memorial day, and there was a big fight going on...so it was packed. But even if it wasn't I hate that they play music over the speakers...HATE. The water in the river pool was murky from who-knows what, and almost impossible to float through because it was jammed with drunkards. The other pools were pretty much the same. Oh well, now I know not to go in the pool unless its a 'slow weekend'.

In conclusion...compared to other hotels\/casinos that I've been to, this is the least obnoxious theme. I mean yeah Bellagio and stuff is classy, but it's a little tacky. Excalibur is worse, and I would rather just go to the real New York. What I mean is MGM is a little bit on the mellow side. Except of course for 'studio' walk or whatever. Oh well. 

Another thing I find useful, is that it's a tram stop making it easy to go places, especially if you are staying at Motel 6 across the street. Just hop across the street, stop at the Fat Tuesday and hop on the tram. So in my book MGM gets the job done. PLUS they have KITTEHS!!!!! Real live lions that live a better life then me! I get excited every time I see them, and it's hard for me to understand how other people don't care to stop and look at them when they are outside.

PS. 
-don't share a cot, the cot is comfy, but not for two people..OUCHIES...
-ask whoever is in your party if they snore or if they have obnoxious relatives who bring 11 strangers to your room to try to party...if they do, kick them out of your Vegas plans.",4,5,4

I've stayed here more times than I can remember and I've stayed at most other hotels in Vegas as well. I always find good room rates here and I usually get a free upgrade when I check-in. Who doesn't love free upgrades? I know this kid does!
My rooms are always clean when I check-in and the maids do quality work on keeping things sparkly and clean. Since I only smoke an occasional cigar I get nonsmoking rooms and they are exactly that. There isn't a trace of smoke smell in them.
From the valet, concierge, greeter and bag boy the staff here is efficient and friendly. I've never had a question they couldn't handle and they've always been on top of things. If you're travel ling with children they do have an arcade and something of a kids' zone to keep the little ones entertained.
Aside from the hotel I've also made use of their pools and cabanas. In my opinion MGM has one of the nicer cabanas in Vegas. I particularly enjoy the fact the adult cabanas are not located directly adjacent the general swimming pool. A little swim, a lot of sun and a lot of drinks make relaxing easier than you'd think.
I highly recommend The MGM Grand as a great hotel to stay at... besides... you're in Vegas. How much time are you going to spend in your room anyways?",1,1,0

Their service was excellent and when they messed up they didn't argue and immediately compensated for it.  As far as prices go it varies from place to place and you won't get the same deals cause it varies with a lot of factors.  There are deals abound online you just gotta plan and dig, especially when it comes to Vegas.  

It was  a pretty enjoyable experience.  The service was good, the rooms are clean, They have one of the tightest pools.  Parking was nice cause there was always someone leaving.  We actually got good parking every time we needed it.  That will vary with the tourist season though.

Things I like
Housekeeping is friendly and efficient
Great view of the strip from most rooms 
The Studio Café for breakfast- Best Lox ever! 
Many really good restaurants 
Maintenance crew responds well.
Photos of yesteryears stars hanging on the walls-Wow did they know how to dress. 

Things I don't like
Horrible water pressure- unfixable
Nasty looking couches in our room
Broken shower handle, so no hot water- until I called for maintenance
Broken hair dryer
Broken lock on our door- until I called for maintenance
No Internet until I called for maintenance 
Requested a King bed, got two queen beds 
Room service doesn't pick up in a timely manner. Wine glasses in hall for 3 days. 
Poor hotel maintenance- Ice cream drips on the beautiful brass elevator doors, never cleaned in the 5 days we were there 
Robot staff at front desk.  
Real Lions on display in a glass enclosure -I get the connection, just don't approve
The rainforest area with all its dusty plastic plants.  
I don't expect cheesiness at a hotel of this caliber 
I also expect to be pampered in a Hotel like the MGM. 
Things seem to be going downhill at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 

But all in all, I had my family with me and that makes everything perfect 
We had a blast playing together. Happy 21ST Birthday Grandaughter 

Now please excuse me I need another nap.

They have SO many restaurants and lame tourist options (hello, cheesy green-screen videos and useless trinkets!) and not enough other fun stuff to look at or do on the premises.  The lion exhibit is only cute for a few minutes, CSI would be better at a theme park, and Tabu lounge was LAME. The people I went with who saw KA weren't raving about it like the other Cirque du Soleil productions, but I think everyone had fun at Studio 54 haha.

I do like the fact that there were so many food options, but you really have to stay for a week to enjoy them all!

Also, hellooooo, mirrors inside the rooms!  It was a bit difficult getting ready to go out when one person is in the bathroom and all of the mirrors are in there.

Never experienced any issues and can't remember anything bad that sticks out through all my stays

The room was upgraded for only $20 dollars to a MGM Grand room I believe. Hint; with AAA you can get a decent discount. Plus the rate for Sunday was only $70 dollars. Parking on the property is now a chargeable expense, cost us $10 dollars a day
The bed was a bit soft, I prefer it that way. The room was quiet, and dark with the shades drawn if you like quiet and dark like I do 
The property has a nice gym and spa that we tried out. The pool is amazing, restaurants are unequal, and plenty of choices high end and fast food.

CASINO...
Very elegant, in keeping with the theme.  And HUGE.  It's pretty much _too_ big; it's easy to get lost inside regardless of the plentiful signage and any cockiness you may have about a sense of direction.  There's an excellent selection of restaurants throughout, but nearly all on the extremely expensive side.  Also, despite the size of the place, it's somewhat cramped and airless by all the machines, tables, and people crammed inside (and searching for a door...).

HOTEL...
Slowest.  Check in.  Ever.  The desk had a full complement of staff, but each employee across the board was taking 10-15 minutes per customer.  I wondered if this might just be overkill on customer service, or maybe even slow computers (I was ready to give benefit of the doubt), until my turn at the front of my line when I discovered that no, it was just slow staff.

Each floor of the hotel is beautiful and airy, especially the central area near the elevators from which the spokes of the hallways radiate.  The rooms are . . . okay.  They're rooms.  Simple, but nicely decorated.  The pictures on the walls are nicely framed black & white photos of stars of stage and screen.  (Some are a bit dark and creepy, but most are nice.)  But the feel is _old_.  The fixtures are not ageing well, from chipped, scarred, and stained chairs, to chipped, scarred, and stained bathroom fixtures.  (I was a little concerned about the toilet.)  The beds are beautiful and supremely comfortable, but otherwise I definitely felt let down by the quality -- I just expected much more.  Plus, for a non-smoking floor, there was a constant definite smell of cigarette smoke in my room.

Overall does the job as a hotel, but the old-school Tinseltown elegance has definitely faded.  With all the other options around, I won't stay here again.",0,0,0

We stayed at the MGM Grand because the Eagles were playing live there and figured it would be more convenient to stay at the same place the Eagles were playing at.  We arrived from the airport which was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport via a taxi and only around $15 with tip and taxi service fees.  The line at check-in was very long.  It took about 20 minutes to check in.  The gal that helped us was really nice.  They gave us a room in the West Wing.  As we walked down the loooooooong hallways to our room we began to notice old suspended ceilings, smelly hall ways and ugly old décor.  We got to the room and was not excited to see what we had just flown 6 hours from Boston to stay in.  The room was tiny.  It had almost no bathroom.  The bath sink was in the room and not in the bathroom.  The toilet was located in the room but not in a separate bathroom.  It was like a closet door in the room.  We quickly decided we could not stay in this room.  We call down to the operator and was connected to some one who said they could not help us because the hotel was full.  I asked to speak to the manager and was given someone whom said the same thing and that the next day they could see if they had something better.  Feeling disappointed we went back down to the front desk and asked for the gal that checked us in.  She had mentioned at check in that if we were not happy to come back and see her.  She was sooo nice and was able to immediately change our room to the main towers.  We had reserved a king size bed but was willing to take the room with the double queen beds instead of the original room.  This new room was great.  It was on the 18th floor room 101.  It even had a nice view.  It would have been ice if the room had a refrigerator that the guest could use.  They had fully stocked refrigerator that you could not use because they had beer, booze, water etc in them and if you removed a item you would be charged.  The room did have a built in safe which was nice.  This room was very nice and the hall ways leading to the room was nice.  The food court was awesome.  The Eagles concert was unbelievable!!!  I was VERY surprised to find out that there was no non smoking area's in the casino!  I have never seen so many smokers in my life!!  The entire hotel smelled solely of cigarette smoke.  We are spoiled up here in New England that we have 2 casino's with non smoking area.  How can the MGM not designate a small non smoking area to their non smoking crowd?  The casino is HUGE and you can not tell me that a area could not be roped off for non smokers.  The smokers were not even considerate to non smokers.  Over all Vegas was a fun ""people watching"" place.  You'll see all kinds of interesting people and activities.  We saw the Jersey Boys at the Paris and loved that.  We took a ride to Freemont St in old Vegas.  It was honky tonk and for the $32 taxi ride each way was probably not worth the visit.  Walking around from hotel to hotel and people watching was fun!  They could of had more pools open with better beverage service.  The only pool open served only beer and wine.  Hope you enjoy your trip!",0,1,0

Ok...I will give them their rating based on magnitude and options. This place is gigantic, and packed full of good food, shopping and entertainment. Fairly easy to get around. View was great, room was comfortable...even if our mini bar was broken.
Now. Let me explain why we will NEVER return to the MGM (not so) Grand. 
First off, upon entering our room, our joy derived from our view and spacious room was instantly sucked from our souls and rendered moot by the open condom wrapper and open tube of lotion by the bed. Then we found someone's clothing...
Then, they improperly coded our room keys which created multiple problems. One, we were locked out of our room. And two, our ""free"" parking almost cost $20, until an argument with the parking attendant solved that issue after ten minutes!
I can overlook certain things...and had nearly forgiven them, until the final straw. 
The most disturbing part of our visit was when I was resting in our room after dialysis. As I was about to drift off into a wonderful pile of pillowed sleep, I heard a noise at our door. DESPITE the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, in walked a guy (from housekeeping I assume)...""oh, you're not checking out?""  NO JACK ASS IM HERE FOR A FEW MORE DAYS!
Why did that happen? Maybe a clerical error, but I don't buy that...
Needless to say, I was very irritated. I could have overlooked even a few more minor irritations, but the blatant disregard for our privacy was beyond unacceptable. 
Not even winning a huge jackpot would get me here again.

The MGM Grand is where I stayed during that trip to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. The folks at the check-in were pretty cool, and the guy who checked us in (I honestly can't remember his name, but he had a strong Italian accent) seemed like a sincerely jolly fellow. Our stay did start off a little oddly, because the only room they had available for my friend and I was a handicapped-accessible room on the first floor. Our jovial Italian check-in guy informed us that we had a good chance of upgrading our room the next day, and he was right...we stayed in that handicapped-accessible room our first night there, and upgraded to a better room the next morning. And in case you were wondering, the most notable details about that handicapped accessible room were that it had a sliding door for the bathroom, a higher toilet and a low shower head in said bathroom, and a table that was a little lower than a usual hotel room table. 

Other things I liked about the MGM Grand:

- the lions exhibit was pretty cool.
- the mini-mall on the lower level of the hotel...I wish that I had more time to explore that area while I was staying there. 
- the wheelchair service they provided for my homie (the one who was celebrating his birthday), when he got too drunk at a club and couldn't make it back to our room under his own power. I would have helped him up, but dude outweighs me by about 40 lbs. Plus I was pretty faded at the time too, and it would have been tough to help him up all the way to our 4th floor room. Props to the security guys who helped us out with that...I thought they were gonna be a-holes, but both of them were cool about it and said they were used to handling situations like that at the hotel. 
- the view from our room was AWESOME.

There wasn't much that i disliked about the MGM Grand, but like one of the other reviewers said, the walls (not to mention the doors) are pretty thin. On our last night there, I could hear kids yelling and running up and down the halls near our room. When it's 4 in the morning, and you're trying to sleep off a hangover on the night before you check out, that's one of the last things you want to hear.

We met up with my mother's other friends who came so it was nice weekend for her. 

The service was rude from nearly the beginning. There was only one great woman at check in when we arrived early but she was replaced by a man who had no clue what to do and couldn't find our reservation, he needed help and was so slow. He took at least half hour. Not only that, my mother overhead him talking about us on the phone nastily like he thought we were making it up about our suite, she got so displeased and I had her to walk away. Then I had to get a manager to try to finish the check in process. Then went to the luggage section so they can check in our bags and the guy said no u have to go to other line but the couple behind us in the other line went to the guy and he checked in their bags! 

There was construction and no signs pointing where the strip was or anything else. It was very time consuming to ask workers how to get on strip or get to a specific location. Some of them pointed to the wrong way. 

We had to call twice and go down in person to request more clean towels. It was a suite yet no coffeemaker in the room. We had to go to Starbucks. 

The pool was nice but hotel should do more to clean up glass\/beer can\/bottles that fall in the lazy river. My mom gambled a bit and we ate in hotel, yet when I called the M life reward I found out NOT one was credited to my players card. It is as if we never were at MGM Grand. 

Next time I would stay in their sister hotels like New York (where I have stayed at least four times) or Mandalay Bay. Even Excalibur offered better services and was so friendly.

We had a nice room (but we were upgraded to an executive suite due to someone being in our room when we walked in after checking in!!! What?! The original room didn't look that great though - very small. The suite was nice, minus the broken sink and light).
Big casino with cool decor. Bathrooms clean.
Pool bartenders were nice.
Deal or no deal interactive machine! It's soooo fun and I'm so thankful they had it (I didn't see it at other casinos). I don't gamble except God this fun game!
Wolf gang puck was yummy and service was sooo good! I got the burger and it was very good! 
Emerald happy hour was pretty good deal and food samples
Bell hop taking our bags to be held for our checkout day was very nice and the guys getting us cabs outside were also.
Check in sucked. I did read other reviews before I left so I was prepared. We got in at 1 am so it wasn't too bad. About 30 min in line. But getting to our room and having it be occupied was a joke. 

Cons:
Casino is too large
Buffett was terrible! Expensive and gross
Starbucks packed every day so NEVER can get a dang coffee. It's so rude as there are no machines in the rooms (of course)
Drinks at the pool were expensive and sometimes not strong at all
Lazy river (why I booked this hotel) was packed and we couldn't get tubes the whole stay. The store and rental sold out   Way too many kids anyway
Pools were gross as too many people were in them by 1. Hair, oil, etc
They had a pharmacy convention the last few days of our stay and therefore closed the pools early and two pools all day to set up for their party at night so the other pools were even more crowded! Sucks when you book the hotel it doesn't tell you that since you won't be getting what they advertise.
Monorail escalators never worked   No one even trying to fix them
$25 a day to unlock n use hotel fridge. What?! So can't eat your left overs that you spent $100-200 on dinner earlier 
Next door suite had a SCREAMING kid - not baby- the first three days of our stay and then the last night were two young girls who left their BLARING music on all night and THEY WEREN'T EVEN IN THERE! Security did come and go in and turn it off but they weren't told because they continued to be obnoxiously loud the rest of the night and day. 
Cocktail servers came by once in an hour of playing and one was very rude

I read reviews after I booked and I was disheartened to say the least. I stayed at MGM 10 years ago and liked it. Wow it's changed. I would not stay here again.",0,0,0

I mean the hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms are really nice, but we had a problem with one of our rooms.  After checking in, we went up to our room to find that one of the room's floors was soaking wet.  We had two rooms, and our other room next door was absolutely fine.  I called down to the front desk to complain, and there was nothing they could do but offer us free dinner buffet for two.  Too bad we had a party of 8 people.  I asked to be switched to a different room, but they weren't able to accomodate us because they claimed the only rooms they had available were smoking rooms.  I kinda didn't believe them, and wanted to at least get the room discounted, but they said they couldnt discount the room further because I had already been set up with a casino rate.  Oh well.  

There is a monorail stop at the hotel, so it made it really convenient to go to other hotels without having to take a taxi or drive ourselves. There was a March special and an all day pass was $9.  The all day pass was for 24 hours following the purchase (we bought ours at 8pm, so it was valid til 8pm the next night)  

There are a lot of places to eat at the hotel, from fine dining to casual eats like Mcdonalds and Nathan's hot dogs.  They also had a Haagen Daz which i loved!  There is also a fat tuesday, which is nice, even though I didn't get anything from there (but i wanted to)  I know that you can buy a yard long margarita and then just bring the cup down and pay less for refills. :)

The lion habitat is something definitely worth checking out if you've never seen it.  

The casino is HUGE, so please be prepared to do some walking if you want to go from one end of the casino to the other. The poker room is always pretty busy, and the tables usually have $10-$15 minimums.  

Join their players club and play some slots, because that way you will be able to get rated and get cheaper rates on their rooms.  :)

We got in pretty late Sunday night. I think our check in was after 9pm so we were too tired to do anything. The check-in was pretty swift. There was no line since it was late so the process took less than 3 minutes. We were assigned a room on the 7th floor in the West area. As soon as we got inside our room, we all detected a cigarette smoke scent. It was just a hint, but it was enough for all of us to get a wiff of it and know that someone obviously smoked in the room. Upon further inspection we noticed a band aid at the foot of the bed and also that the bathroom counter was super dusty. My sister said she was too tired to complain, but my other sister did call the front desk to tell them about our dissatisfaction with the room. The person in the front desk told my sister that she would tell the next cleaning lady to do a thorough job with cleaning it the next day.

Cut to the next day....We left the room to grab breakfast downstairs. We got back to our room and saw the beds were made and everything fully restocked. So my sister checks on the band aid we found and IT WAS STILL THERE. My sister and I marched downstairs and told them what's happening. We were assisted by Jeannie who was training Ryan. She was very apologetic and moved us to a different floor at our request. For the inconvenience, she also comped our buffet. Three free buffets. All we really wanted was to be moved, so the added treat was nice. We were moved to the 25th Floor. As soon as we walked in, it smelled fresh and clean and the view was far nicer.

The rest of our stay was wonderful. My sisters went to Wet Republic while I napped. They said it was great. They went right before the sunset so it wasn't too crowded. Meanwhile, I enjoyed the quiet room and checked out a movie that was playing.

We had dinner at the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. The food was great. We also did a little bit of walking around in the casino as well as checking out a show. My aim was to not leave the casino. Basically it was to see if they really had literally everything you need that you didn't feel the need to go to the strip. They do. I ate there, did a bit of gambling, used the gym and enjoyed what they had to offer.

I've stayed at all the other casinos on the strip at least once and I'd have to say MGM is up there with the best. The facilities are great, the rooms spacious, great view wherever you are and lots of fun activities and shows. We also saw KA and loved it. It was quite an impressive show.

Bottom line, I think I've found my go to. I'm definitely staying here for the rest of time that I come visit the city of sin.",6,0,2

We reserved 4 rooms, and I called 3 different times prior to the trip to request that our rooms all be on the same floor. I already assumed with a long weekend coming up it wasn't going to be likely that we would be able to get 4 rooms right next to each other. The agent on the phone told us that it was pretty likely our request could be accommodated since we agreed the rooms could be scattered as long as we had them all one one floor, so we didn't worry about it. Once we checked in, it turns out that 2 of our rooms were on one floor and 2 were on another floor. I told the front desk I had called several different times to make the request and he could care less. He didn't seem sympathetic toward our disappointment whatsoever. When we were still standing at the front desk I hear the lady next to us checking in another guest and she said loud enough for us to hear ""oh across the hallway okay?"" and the guest responded ""yeah that's fine as long as the rooms are next to each other."" To me that sounds like the guest was being accommodated for her needs and we were not. We didn't let it ruin the trip though and thought ""hey at least its one floor apart from each other"". Then when one of the couples in our group got inside their room, they said it smelled repulsive like mold and had to change rooms, and was then placed on ANOTHER completely different floor. So in total 4 of our rooms were on 3 different floors. It wasn't how we thought our stay would be and I expected better customer satisfaction. Probably will try something else out next time.",2,1,1

We decided to go on Super Bowl Sunday and stay for 2 nights.  Once we got there, we followed the signs to parking lot. The parking lot is so huge and the elevators were super confusing as some only went up and some only went down. ( good tip is once you park start walking towards the hotel and there should be an escalator that leads to the entrance at the end of the parking lot). The good thing is the lobby is near the parking lot.

I knew that our comp room entitled us to the dreaded West Tower.  I heard about people slipping the employee who is checking you in a $20 for a upgrade. I have never tried it before but after some liquid courage, we slipped the employee a $20 and asked about an upgrade. She said she would check and she obliged us with a room in the main tower (sweet!). The room itself was pretty nice and it seemed renovated. The pool was closed for us as it is open from May to September, which was fine because it was too cold to swim.

My only complaint was that on our last night there, there was some drilling that was going on at 2 am in the morning and didn't stop until 4 am!! We called down to the lobby and they said they had to do some constructions, but it was pretty annoying that they were doing this in the middle of the night.

This is the best second tier hotel on the strip (top tier being the luxurious dens of excess like the Venetian).  I've managed to stay at pretty much every hotel on the strip and the MGM is where I prefer to leave my luggage.  The rooms are modern and well appointed.  The casino is huge.  The selection of restaurants fits all budgets.  There are two big clubs in the hotel (Tabu and Studio 54).  And they have a lion show a few times a day where you can watch two lions interact with trainers and have their pictures taken.  

Sure you may be able to find a nicer room on the strip, but you're going to pay much more for it...and you shouldn't be going to Vegas to spend tons of time in your room anyway...
 
Let's one thing straight from the get go...  People smoke in Vegas casinos.  I hate hearing people complain that the casinos are smokey.  That's like complaining that a bar smells like booze or that your local gym doesn't smell like a flower field.  It's just part of the program and you have to deal with it.
 
That said, it is always nice when your room actually gives you some sense of being on vacation.  It can be pretty discouraging staying at a hotel where the rooms are tired or only qualify as a room because they have a bed, a bathroom, and tv.  The basic rooms are very nice with tasteful art on the walls (pictures of movie stars and Vegas icons from the 40's and 50's), plenty of marble in the bathroom, and towels that actually have some thickness to them (I hate those paper thin towels some places give you).  Move up to a Spa Suite and you get a huge room with cavernous bathroom and a spa tub.

I really like the feel of the casino.  It winds on forever and there is no shortage of tables.  The poker room is pretty large too and you will find a variety of players from all over the world in there (not just locals like some rooms).  The kicker is that they have one of those Sigma Derby mechanical horse racing machines over by the sports book.  You pick the horses that will come in first and second and get odds on your quarter bets...fun fun fun.

The one knock that I have about the MGM is that it is so big, the walk from your room to the pools is a journey.  
 
Oh and beware staying in one of the new towers, otherwise known as The Signature at MGM Grand.  We had some friends stay there during our last visit and it is a lengthy walk to and from the casino floor.  The front desk even mentioned a shuttle service to and from that part of the property, so you know it's out there.
 
MGM MONEY SAVING TIPS (because we are all cheap bastards at heart):
 
You can get a good sized deli sandwich for $7.25 at the Stage Deli over by the sports book and poker room.  They also have hot dogs, soups, and other snacks that won't bruise your wallet too badly.  Grab a quick bite here after your late night carousing, as it is open until 2:00 or 3:00AM on the weekends.
 
A nice cheap snack - If you go to the food court where the McDonald's and the Nathan's are located, there is a Chinese fast food place on the left side where you can get a ""side"" of chow mein or fried rice for $1.50.  A side is a plate full.  The chow mein is a good snack, as you get noodles and veggies (bean sprouts, onions, and some cabbage).  That could actually be one of the more healthy meals that you have while you are in Vegas.
 
If you play slots, you have to join their Players Club.  It is one of those group things, since the MGM is owned by the same company that also owns a host of other hotels on the strip like New York New York, Bellagio, and Mandalay Bay.  Put that card into the machine and take your shot at winning 1,000 nickels.  The benefits are huge, ranging from receiving great room deal (you have to opt in online to get them) to very generous comps.  My wife just likes to play penny and nickel slots, but we always get some kind of great perk.  Call the players club before you check out and ask if you qualified for any comps.  We have gotten one or two nights of our stay comp'd or at the very least all of our food charges comp'd.  Not bad.",6,0,1

Just a little.

The casino itself is pretty decent, but being on the South end of the strip makes it a bit less convenient to walk to other casinos.  For me, it didn't matter because I've been to Vegas too many times, and I'm so over visiting each and every casino.

The restaurants downstairs are decent, but there are a couple of Wolfgang Puck restaurants that were completely devoid of customers.    Overall, if you can get it a deal when booking, I don't think you will be dissatisfied by the experience at all.",1,1,1

Being an MGM-Mirage Players Club member, I was offered a promotional rate via email: $59.99 (Monday - Thursday) and $79.99 (Friday). This was much such a good deal that I couldn't pass it up, in the past I usually booked through either Expedia, Orbitz, or Travelocity. 

I have one of the MGM-Mirage credit cards which offers certain perks such as earning Gift Certificates, Invited Guest Check-In, and Early\/Late Check-Out. 

During this visit I was able to use the Invited Guest Check-In, which you think would be more efficient since this is the line that people with Casino Hosts use. I was only the third person in line, and it took longer than if I would've waited in the normal check-in lines 5 or 6 people deep. 

The room was nothing too special, it had a view of the parking garage and Koval Lane. The TV was outdated (TI had upgraded to LCD TVs in 2006). The best part of the room was the bed, which was surprisingly comfortable. 

I'm not sure if it was isolated to our room but there was an adjoining door to the room next to us that seemed as if it was paper thin, we could hear normal conversations being carried out late at night and early in the morning. 

The pool is a mystery to find. I am thinking that the pool was more accessible in the past before the hotel did renovations in connecting the MGM Grand to the MGM Signature Towers. From the elevator,  you need to walk through some shopping areas down a long corridor to the pool. 

I almost think that the casino is too big at the MGM Grand. If you want to visit any of the other casinos in the area: NY NY or Excalibur it is a very long walk from the elevators to the walkways of these casinos. Also, some of the slots are very dated, especially the quarter slots. We had a slot machine malfunction twice in about a 30 minute time frame. Also, with the casino being so big, the cocktail waitresses are nowhere to be found in the slots areas.

I'm a non-smoker and found this hotel to be clean and fresh smelling. The ambience is nice too and it has an overhead walkway to the New York New York which is a really fun casino. The only drawback is that its near the south end, so not right in the middle of the action like the bellagio, mirage, or flamingo. Still, it is pretty close with the deuce bus and the southern end of the strip is still better than the northern end. Id rather be in the MGM than anywhere near of ceasar palace when the casinos start spreading out more. I would definately stay here again, or perhaps the mirage with is an MGM casino as well. Really good bang for your buck. After walking through places like caesars, manadalay, bellagio, I found them to be overrated. The MGM gives an upper class feel for less money.",0,0,0

I've never stayed here, here but the MGM has become a part of our trip because of the legendary Lion's Share slot machine. The rumor is that this is part of an old bank of progressive slots and the casino can't remove it until it pays out. The jackpot was up to $2M in Sept 2012. To find it, go to the high-limit slot area and ask the attendant there where it is (it moves around the floor). Also, CraftSteak is near the top of our Vegas steakhouses list.",1,0,0

Our hotel room on the other hand was disappointing. The walls are seriously paper thin, you could hear the people next door talking and joking around until like 4 in the morning.

I was told they would be put on a higher floor and that the hotel would do something nice for them since they were celebrating two birthdays. When my parents got there they were given a room on the 3rd floor in a location where they had to walk a very long distance just to get to the elevator. My mom has a bad knee and that walk was not reasonable for her. When they asked to get their room changed, they were put on the 13th floor but were charged an extra $20 per night. When they checked out, the hotel had a fee charged to them because they had arived early and left their bags with the conceirge. After my dad complained the fee was removed. 

I called MGM to let them know how upset and embarrassed I was that they charged my parents for a room that they were suposed to get for free. They acknowledged the fact that the notes said to put them in a higher floor room and its their birthdays but said higher floors are based on availability and they do not do anything special for birthdays. They had no regard for the fact that their rep had promised me these things when I was making the reservation. The room was obviously available since they put them on the 13th floor, and they had the note in their system with instructions, so why did they have to pay for it? The manager denied they did anything wrong, said she would ""have a talk"" with the rep for saying they would do something nice for the birthdays, and denied the attempted charge for leaving the bags with the conceirge. All she had to do was say sorry or refund the $40 charged to my parents. I'd even refrain from writing this review if they refunded my parents and charged me instead. But the fact that they did nothing and showed no remorse and did not care when I told them I would never book a room with them again, made me write my first review on yelp.

The TV was the old-fashioned, non-flat screen kind.  The beds were super comfortable and the pillows were the best I've ever had. They seemed like overstuffed down pillows. I'd like to find out what they are and buy some for my bed at home!

The pool area was very nice, if crowded. We particularly enjoyed the lazy river.  This hotel seems to attract mostly people in their 20's bent on drinking and having a good time.

The first time was for my bachelorette party so we got a suite. It was the perfect! There were 12 girls and suite was able to accommodate all of us comfortably and ALL our luggage! The suite was clean and the service was prompt. Our suite had two king beds, a sectional in the living area, and a pull out bed. I think the only thing missing was a kitchenette and since originally we only planned on 8 girls staying in the suite, we didn't think we needed to opt for that (another option was the penthouse suite at  PH). But when we landed the other girls wanted to stay with us and it's always more fun when you have ALL your girls with you in one room right? So they cancelled their reservations at their hotel and it was a 3 day slumber party at the MGM!! I'd definitely recommend looking in their suites if you are coming with a larger party. 

The second time I stayed here was for my birthday. It was just me and a girlfriend of mine. Since I'm actually the one that booked the hotel and checked in, I can give you insight on my experience in that process. I booked through the hotel's site and it was an easy process and I was able to pick and choose the room I wanted. Upon arrival and checkin, the man that checked us in was so nice and we were able to get early check in, late check out, and a room upgrade all comped!! Now, for our room. Very clean, very spacious, and a great view. We got two queen beds and room service again was very prompt. Honestly, it was a lot of room for just two people but I'm not complaining.

One thing you need to do for sure is visit their  massive pool complex, its huge!! They have five pools, including a pool for adults only, as well as a lazy river and a whirlpool. They also have a snack bar near the pool that have hamburgers, nachos, etc. Hungry? This place have a variety of dining options to offer from upscale restaurants, such as Emeril's , to more casual restaurants like Studio Cafe. They also have a McDonald's  and a Starbucks for those who want something quick to eat. They  have nightclubs, like Studio 54, which is great for those who want to have a  date night out. If you are staying at the MGM Grand then I recommend you staying at the Grand Tower. The rooms are much larger and nicer than the rooms in the West Wing Tower. I got a great deal on the room rates by joining their fan page on their website. The rooms does not have flat screen tv  like other hotels on the strip but who comes to Vegas just to watch tv?  The staff were very accommodating in assisting your needs and the lines were not that long when I was checking in\/out. 

I forget to mention if you are going to see the KA Cirque del Soleil show, I highly recommend you wait and purchase your tickets when you arrive here. Guests who are staying at the hotel receive 40% percent off on tickets to the show so don't book online!!

Was booked for a suite and told I was to go to VIP check-in. Upon arriving, I was met by a young woman who was assigning everyone into their proper registration line. When I told her I needed to go to VIP check-in she looked me up and down (was wearing jeans and a polo) with a condescending look and stated she did not think I needed to be in VIP check-in. Instead, was sent into the herd with everyone else. 

While in line, I was approached by another employee and was asked if I needed any help. When I told her that I was to go to VIP check-in, she brought me to the back of yet another line. No drinks while waiting, no Mr., Sir, etc... The agent checking me in did not appear to know what was going on. At one point she went in the back room for 5 minutes or so without saying when she would be back. I saw another employee pass by and asked him if my original agent would be back. Apparently he was a Concierge because he pointed towards that desk and walked off. So much for Customer Service.

When the agent finally came back, I was informed there was a $500 deposit because it was a suite. Not being a rockstar who wrecks hotel rooms I was a little confused why it would be required. I used a credit card to hold the room, so they already knew how to find me if something happened.

The room itself was not particularly impressive. The bathroom was about half the size of the room and covered in marble that became slippery when wet. Fired up the jacuzzi tub and a strong smell of bleach permeated the room. We had to turn it off after a few minutes as it was too much to handle.

During the stay I ordered the ""Shrimp Noodle Bowl"" from room service. It cost approximately $30 JUST FOR THAT. When it arrived it was two large pieces of shrimp with Noodles below them. What surprised me most was that the noodles themselves were Beef Ramen. It wasn't that it just looked like Beef Ramen, smelled like Beef Ramen, or tasted like Beef Ramen. IT WAS BEEF RAMEN. 30 G-D DOLLARS FOR BEEF RAMEN. AHHH!!

The only shining light the entire stay was the bellman on the way out. Very professional and helpful. I am sure the poorly managed organization at the MGM will ensure he is never promoted, praised, nor rewarded. 

Overall, I would stay far away from this hole. It is already one of the older properties on the strip and it shows. Spend a few more dollars (literally) and stay at the Encore or something. The MGM is played out.

I actually just came back this past weekend and I didn't realize it was also spring break for a lot of college kids so that could have made a big difference.  What was absolutely excruciating was the check in\/check out line.  I would have to say that was the worst part of Vegas I've experienced all weekend long.

I do have one advice as far as checking in\/checking out.  You can somewhat skip the checkin\/checkout line by standing in the ""Invited Guests"" line.  That's what my boyfriend ended up doing while I stood in the other line in case if they rejected him, but they didn't.  Makes sense since the hotel doesn't want to rub off the wrong way to a hotel guest.  

Also, beware--their checkout system via T.V. didn't work either so when you do check out, try and look for the ladies who are carrying the little pads, they are able to check you out if you don't want to stand in that 20-30 minute line...  Checking out via those individuals with the pads is that you can't see the charges that have been charged to your room but if you didn't mess with the censored goodies or charged a restaurant bill to your room, you should be good to go.

Hope that helps and have a great time in Vegas if you stay at the MGM!!!

Studio 54 and Tabu' are here for dancing.  Lots of nice eats from sushi to steak.  And cheap eats from New York Pretzel, Nathan's Hot Dogs and let's not forget Fat Tuesday pina colada smoothies served in what could be used as a portable urinal for both sexes.  Gross!  But true....

Pools are awesome!  A pool for everyone.  First there's the party pool where dance music is playing while the 20's crowd bob up and down in the pool with plastic beer bottles.  Go early since that's the only time you'll be able to swim.  The 30's pool, still close enough to the party pool but if you have stretch marks and a belly this is the one to go to.  The central pool, usually for those who don't venture out into the other pools.  The back pool, I noticed for seniors and much more quiet than the other pools.  Then the FUN POOL!!  There's a lazy river  here that has a current AND there are waterfalls!!  Great for kids but fun for just lazing around....

Rooms are comfortable, stylish and have standard amenities.  They had a cool stylish sofa that is great to sit on and feels like therapy having a conversation on it.  Marble floors in the bathroom that I almost slipped on, but nice toilet paper.  The lotion was actually really nice too!  I'm big on lotion!

This hotel has a Monorail station that goes clear across the North part of the Strip and ideal for staying out of the heat.  A 24 hour pass is $9.  Not bad for cruising through the hotels on the strip.

I would probably stay at this hotel again!

There is no hot water so I've been freezing trying to shower as quickly as possible with that cold water. The tub took 15 minutes to drain so that was annoying too. No coffee in the room and they wanted to charge us an extra $35 a night for a fridge. For a ""5 star"" hotel it's definitely a let down.

Never stayed at the MGM Grand (I always stay at the Mandalay Bay) but it is definitely close enough to where I can take a tram to the Excalibur and walk over to play a little 2\/4 limit holdem, a game they have scheduled regulary which is cool. The MGM also has the last Sigma Derby in Las Vegas, which may seem cool, but the sound is really obnoxious, and you can hear it from everywhere in the casino. If you were wondering what that loud farting noise was, it is actually a simulation of horses running. It is actually really funny to see all these people gathered around this old machine betting quarters and shaking their cups of change and yelling at the small plastic horses.

I mainly come here for the 2\/4 limit game. The poker room is situated right by the lion sanctuary and is nice- but not as nice as the one inside The Mirage. If you want to come here to play no-nonsense poker this is a good place. The games are always going off consistently and there isn't much of a wait. Plus the swanky computerized wait list with the names is pretty cool. Lots of TVs, very good drink service, and you can also get food brought to you too.

When I come to visit Las Vegas, I make it a point to stay at one of their hotels. I have stayed at the MGM Grand Hotel before and my most previous stay was this past weekend. I can safely say that I have once again made the right decision in choosing where to stay. 

I will first start with the rooms:

The first time I stayed at MGM Grand, I booked a Grand Queen room. But upon check in, I requested an upgrade and they offered me a Stay Well Grand Queen room. Situated on the 14the floor of the hotel, the room was designed for wellness in mind. The floor is non-smoking and the room offers amenities that other rooms in the hotel do not have which include special beds, aromatherapy, an air purification system and many others. The room is perfect for guests who REALLY want to relax. My favorite amenity in this room had to be the Vitamin C infused shower. Think of it as a spa room. It was the best decision I made and the room was so comfortable I almost didn't want to leave my room for the entire stay. I said almost...LOL! 

The second time I stayed at MGM Grand I opted to stay in a Grand Queen room. It's not as fancy as the Stay Well Grand Queen, but it was comfortable nonetheless. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom had all that you needed to make your stay complete. 

Now on to the food:

The MGM Grand has many dining options that range from fast food to luxury dining but my favorite place to eat at the MGM Grand is The Wolfgang Bar & Grill. I always have the Spaghetti & Meatballs for my entree and the Creme Brûlée for my dessert. Always. Every time I come to Las Vegas, even if I don't stay here I come and have dinner here. It's that good. 

Casino Floor:

The casino floor has every slot machine and every table game imaginable and in every denomination and betting minimums. Unfortunately this is where the MGM Grand's weakness lies. There are so many people that play and stay here that it feels like I never get a chance to play the machines or table games that I want. I also feel like while the casino is big, I feel very crowded in the gaming areas. I usually end up playing in another M Life property. But when I do get a chance to hit up a table game, the dealers are super nice, very helpful and if you ask them a question about the rules of the game they are more than willing to help. 

Entertainment:

Like everything else in this Casino, the options are endless. They have bars, clubs, comedy clubs etc. etc. etc. You name it, they have it. I myself have been inside The Brad Garret Comedy Club and was privileged enough to watch Mike Tyson perform his award winning show Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth. The Comedy Club atmosphere is really nice and while we sat towards the back, we were able to see and hear Mike Tyson just fine.

They also have a Top Golf driving range here and that was definitely high on my list of things to do while I was out here. Be forewarned though it is a walk to get here. The walk from my hotel room to Top Golf took a solid 10-15 mins. But it was well worth the walk. 

All in all I would highly recommend the MGM Grand. Its a huge resort that has clean rooms, an awesome staff that are very friendly and all the gaming, dining and entertainment options that one needs to have a fun and enjoyable stay in Las Vegas and I myself will continue to stay here again and again.

I use to stay here all the time however it has been a couple yrs. Our first night our comforter had a red stain on it (not sure what the heck it was)... lucky for us we were given two queen sized beds so we used the other. Next, our shower had no shower curtains or drapes. We called housekeeping the first time and let them know of the situation. She said okay we'll be up soon and hung up. An hour later we called again and spoke to someone else and she said the first order was never placed for our room and she they'll be right up. An hour later we called again because still no one had shown up and this time housekeeping was unavailable so i was forced to go down stairs to speak to someone abt this. He was friendly and acted surprised when i said the room had no shower curtains and said to give him a moment after taking down my information. After about 5 mins he came back and apologized, thanked me for my patience and said the manager has ordered for an immediate delivery... after 3 hours, still no curtains so we took the bed sheets off of the dirty bed and used them as shower curtains. The reason why it was a big deal is because it was a bath tub is next to the toilet so everytime we need to use the restroom we would be walking thru water. Anyways, this is the first night.

My friend and I are here now and when we checked in to our room l, we couldn't help but notice how filthy it was. (Eg hair on the bed, makeup stains on the sheets, hair all over the bathroom tile, and dirty shower). We called to complain and the supervisor came to our room and said, ""who gave you this room?"" ""This room was never cleaned, I don't know why front desk would assign you this room."" She then said sometimes there is a glitch in the system and it shows rooms have been cleaned. We had already wasted half of our day and the woman said that we can wait while it's being cleaned. It was inconvenient and a waste of time. It was also irritating how the supervisor just acted nonchalant about it. Like it was okay that we were given a dirty room. She wasn't nice at all about it. She also acted like it was a nuisance that we were complaining about a used and dirty room!!!Anyways, we asked to just get a brand new clean room and it was even worse. Just disgusting. We asked for it to be recleaned and we just dealt with it since our whole day was wasted already due to this incompetence. 

The beds are nasty and the walls are very thin. You can hear every noise from the hallway. Also, the water in the shower doesn't get hot until it's running for 20 min. 
Update: sometimes it never gets hot. So miserable!!!

There weren't any rooms (no big deal, it was early) so we decided to go to the buffet. $40 for food that was practically inedible. The fine gentleman that runs the omelette station apparently isn't much of a multitasker. I guess he's unable to cook and hit on my wife at the same time since her omelette was raw on the inside when she sat down to eat. The rest of the food was dry and tasted like it sat out for days. We finally get a room that was suppose to have a view of the pool, we have a beautiful view of the top of a building. After a long day of traveling we decide to call it a night and hit it hard the next day. We wake up early to go to the pool and have to go to the gift shop for sunscreen since a normal container is too big to fly with. $20 for a  can of sunscreen, the kid behind the counter agreed that it's a ripoff. There's only 2 pools open in the morning, and the lazy river doesn't open until 10:00. Half of the restaurants and bars inside the hotel don't open until later in the day. We go back to our room to shower before we hit the strip and arrive to find our room door wide open. The lock the door decided to stop working, luckily all our valuables were locked in the safe.

We order our drinks, only to be informed that their blender is broken? Apparently there's only one blender in the entire hotel.

We were annoyed with the inconvenience because we had to haul our luggage back downstairs to the check-in desk.

Also, they have the JabbaWockeez dance show. I always come through this hotel, they have a huge gambling floor with almost every slot and table game you can think of. It has many shops and restaurants in the vicinity. The one thing I don't like because the hotel is so huge the parking lot is huge too and it takes a bit of a walk from the parking lot to the through the lobby to get to the hotel. 

The other nice thing about this hotel is that it has a bridge that links to New York New York where the Hersey factory is. It is also located next to the big Ross store, Coke Cola and the M&M store. The staff if very friendly and it is well airconditioned because there are so many people who smoke. The floor area and the slots are always clean and they always have casino service people walking around ready to give directions or assistants.

1) The lazy river
2) A Coors light in hand as I am tubing around the Lazy river
3) Napping away my hangover on my tube in the Lazy river
Can you tell that I am all about their lazy river?? 
My other favorite thing is that they got rid of the Sky Screamer. I try to fulfill most dares and this is not one I ever wanted to do - and now I don't have to. 
I also think the rooms are really nice and we've never had an issue with noise. 
I am a huge fan of their Rain Forest Cafe and feel their Cobb salad is probably the biggest I've ever gotten. 
Being a cat lover, I can also totally appreciate the cat sanctuary. If only they'd let me in it to feed the lions!! 
Even when we haven't stayed at the MGM, we've always made a point to go to their club Studio 54. I don't know if it's the multiple levels or acrobats coming down from the ceiling or just the familiarity, but it's my favorite club. 
The buffet here is as good as any of the other hotels, just a little cheaper than the new 5 and 6 star ones popping up. 
You can catch the monorail from the MGM all the way to the north end of the strip or cross the overpass and catch another one that heads south, ending at the Mandalay Bay. 
This hotel is family friendly and always has good deals. It's a win-win, even if you don't win on the gaming floor!",2,2,2

We felt like queens. We had two queen sized beds in our room, they were great!!! We got free passes to the clubs in the casino.  We were also able to cut the line at the buffet!!! This trip was awesome overall, but what really made me look back at this hotel was the customer service they provided above and beyond.

I bought a top in Vegas, wore it one night, somehow got it stained, and sent it to the hotel's drycleaning service.  Well lets just say my top would never look the same again. I brought it up to the manager at the bell desk. Now keep in mind it was my last day there...I was freaking out that this would never get fixed!!! The manager took my top and told me someone would get back to me. I was mad to say the least, and then the dry cleaning company the hotel works with wouldn't refund my money.  I called the bell desk back and told them what happened and the manager ended up sending me a check about a month later. What I love the most was that they constantly followed up with me, making sure that something was being done. Now thats customer service!!!!!!",1,1,1

Pros:
1.) Smells heavenly.
2.) They upgraded our room during a holiday weekend (so extra points for accommodating us)
3.) Won a few hundred here (score)
4.) The bed was sooooo comfortable, firm but soft.
5.) Modern rooms (attached a few pics).
6.) Tons of restaurants here, if you want cheap restaurants, you want expensive restaurants they have it.
7.) Shopping (even though I didn't, but could tell tons of the women were enjoying it)
8.) Lots of cute chicks here.
9.) One of the best clubs in Vegas (Hakkasan) even though we didn't go and decided to go to a WAY better club in my opinion, XS at Wynn (AMAZING CLUB).
10.) Its close to the airport (taxi ride was $10.50)
11.) McDonald's and Nathan's were open till 3:50am late night munchies after partying.
12.) And the most important pro, they have the best pool scene.  If you want an exclusive pool party were you have to spend $50-$100 to get in, you can go to Wet Republic (which I've been to), BUT, for a free and even BETTER time, you can go to the Grand Pool Complex at MGM (the general pool) which has a lazy river and have an awesome time.  The pool scene is kind of slow from 9-11am, but the best sets get taken quick, so get there early to lock it down, but by 1-3pm, the party is rocking and you get all the music from Wet Republic.  By 4-5, your partying and meeting tons of fun and cool random people along the lazy river.  YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.  Just make sure to down a few energizers from the bars (there $20), after 3, the place was off the hook.  

Cons:
1.) Check in here sucks.  The line wasn't an issue for us, we must have waited 3 minutes at most.  The real issue was that we had to wait till 3pm to get our room, even though we were willing to pay the early check in fee of $30. (-.5 star)
2.) No cable service the whole stay and to make matters worse we called the front desk but no one came to fix it.  But to be fair, they did give us a discount, so no negative stars.

Overall, I love it here, its not the newest hotel, but they did a great job with their renovation.  I'll be back next year!",3,2,0

It took about 45 minutes for them to correct our Priceline reservation. We had paid for two for one buffet, free admission to Studio 54 and two free drinks but they didn't have any record and had to find it (which they did). The person that originally checked us in rushed us out before we had the chance to ask any questions, but the second person we got (after waiting in line again) was great and resolved the issue. 

We then got two shows, KA and David Copperfield. Both were great shows, KA was the best show I've seen anywhere, ever... and David Copperfield was entertaining (but not to the scale of KA). 

Our room needed a lot of work. The remotes didn't work, but were replaced after a few hours of waiting. The shower flooded the bathroom and bedroom area (there was no sealer under the curtain) but the front desk was responsive in getting fresh towels up within a few minutes after that happened. 

The lamp in the room on the desk would constantly spark, sometimes randomly and any time you tapped it. The power in the room caused some power issues with my laptop which appeared like it might be causing random surges (which would also explain the lamp issue). We were not able to get a lamp that did not spark during our stay.  Additionally, the wireless only worked the first day we were there (but no discount on the ""resort fee!"")

Check out was fast, efficient, and painless. 

Overall, the service was excellent, the rooms were poor, and the shows were great. We'll definitely be back for the entertainment, but will be staying somewhere else in the future.",0,1,0

The annoying - I think I've mentioned before that my husband must have coffee in the morning.  Well, no coffeepot in the room.  Is this a recent trend?  This is particularly annoying in the fact that you have to haul yourself through a casino to get to the food court to get a cup of coffee in the morning.  

The lazy river is a meat market.  People just standing around with drinks in their hand clogging up the river.  People, it's a river, there's current, you're meant to float along.  If you want to pick up a stranger or stand around w\/a drink in your hand, go to the adult swimming pool.  I'm just saying if you want to hook up, as long as you're floating, that's fine.  

The good - there were no bed bugs.  I was a little worried.  (call me paranoid).  The beds were comfortable.  The room did not smell like smoke.  I got a good deal, room with tix (but there was almost a huge fiasco there)  Tell you about it later.

My daughter loved the lazy river.  Now, they say you can't bring in outside flotation devices, but it does not seem to be strictly enforced.  I mean, really, when you run out of tubes and they say you can go buy one and use it, how are they to know where you bought your flotation device, really.   Or they say, people usually abandon them and if you see one floating or an empty one just use it.  So we got a freebie w\/out having to pay $16 for rental fee. I asked a guy who didn't seem to be using his.  There seemed to be a lot of hoarding of inner tubes.

The excellent - KA is really good.  Amazing.  This show feels like it's in 4-d with the actors\/acrobats wandering through the audience and the stage revolving in 360 degrees, it seemed to me.

The food - There is a food court, so there are some lower-priced food options for breakfast and stuff.  The breakfast\/brunch buffet on Sat is pretty decent.  They have casino roast( prime rib-ish) and ham and also shrimp.  The bagels are as hard as a rock.  Even toasting does not help.  They have really good no sugar desserts.  Now I am not a fan of the no-sugar.  I hate that disgusting after taste.  But these were so pretty, that I had to try them.  They were really good w\/out aftertaste and so cute.  We went in before 9 a.m. so we got the early bird discount.  $19.99 instead of $24,99.  I wanted to do one buffet before we left town.

The ugly - So I mentioned that I got the room with Ka tix.  I do not know why, but I was never able to get a e-mailed confirmation for my room w\/Ka tix.  I seriously called three times.  When I made the reservations thru their hotel reservation line, the lady gave me Section A seating.  Whoo-hoo.  These are supposedly $100+ tix.  So I really wanted that e-mail confirmation bec. I did not want to get screwed and find out that, oh, no, we made a mistake and there are no tix or we're going to have to charge you for those tix or whatever.

Well, arrive, check, you can pick up tix at concierge.  Okay.  Pick up tix at concierge.  Oh, wait, we have to charge these tix to your room.  When you check out, you'll be comped. (warning bells are ringing in my head)  Go to show (see above. )

Next day, check out.  You betcha.  Oh, the reservation person should have given you section C seating.  That package is only for Section C seating.  let me talk to my manager.  Oh, we can reimburse you $100, and you're have to eat the rest.  

Me: Oh, no.  I called several times to make sure this scenario that we are enacting would not happen.  

Them:  Well, we're front desk, we have no control over what they told you.  I don't have any access to any notes they may have kept in their system.

Me:  Let's call them and find out.   Call reservation, on hold for ten minutes.  (I tell the people behind me, you should find another line to check out bec. this is going to take a while.)  Finally get ahold of reservation.  Hey, you said these tix would be free with 2-night stay. 
Reservation:  Your letter says only one guest.
Me:  So what?  I asked for two tickets. You reserved two tickets.  You gave me two tix.
Reservation:  What happened when you checked in, did they say anything at the front desk?
Me:  NO.  What would they say?  It's obvious I'm more than a single guest.  I got a room w\/ two queen beds and got two tix and bought one extra tix.  It's fairly obvious that I'm not here by myself.

Well, it's too late to make this post short, but I think it was time for the lady at the front desk to go off.  I had obviously made it clear that I did not feel it was my mistake and they said they would take the charge off.  The squeaky wheel gets oiled.

If worse came to worse, I would have taken the $100 reimbursement and paid the difference.  The show was worth it, but it's the damn principal.  I had called them on three separate occasions to get the confirmed info, and they dropped the ball.",3,1,0

I come to Vegas quite often and I've stayed at numerous hotels on the strip including Planet Hollywood, The Venetian, Treasure Island, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Bally's, Caesar's and some off the strip and downtown. 

I expected so much more from The MGM given that they're supposed to be one of the top properties on the strip. 

Of all my Vegas visits I have never experienced a more horrendous check in process. We waited over an hour to check into the hotel! The line was so long that the hotel was giving out free alcoholic drinks! It was a mess! They charge for parking now as well. If you're going to charge people all this money, the least you could do is make it more convenient for them! We were also unable to check out from the TV and waited over 20 minutes to try to check out via phone so we had to again wait in line to check out!

The reviews were pretty good, as I understood it was one of the newer and nicer hotels on the strip, and I was also excited to check out Hakkasan night club, since I knew Tiesto was the resident DJ there. We arrived on a Wednesday around 3pm. Check-in line was about 10 mins, which is not unreasonable at a large hotel. The guy who checked us in was polite but not what I would call friendly. I mentioned we were celebrating my birthday which didn't get any reaction out of him, not that it's a big deal I mean it's MY birthday so I'm the one that gets to be excited. We booked a pretty basic room in the west wing tower. The room was comfortable, very average. Lighting was dim in the room but great in the bathroom. We did have automated blinds and a huge window that provided plenty of natural light, yet there were windows of the other rooms close by which eliminated privacy with open blinds. The mattress was not uncomfortable, but did give me shoulder pain for 3 days after we left. We were there for 5 nights, and I am spoiled, taking into consideration I sleep on a Tempurpedic at home. I enjoyed the pool, although the lazy river is not the cleanest, but a few Coronas will make you not care. Wet Republic was disappointing. Long security process to get in which I thought was silly, and on the inside is a very warm shallow pool and a bar with unusually expensive alcohol. And no of course you can not bring your drink in there unlike everywhere else. We thought we were going to a ""pool party"" but I wouldn't really call it a party at all. Although maybe it was a bad Saturday. Hakkasan was amazing. We got to see Tiesto, and it was a great way to start my birthday celebration. We got on the guest list and in for free, of course the line to get in was an hour and a half but we got in right before he came out. HE was worth the wait. Overall the staff and security at the hotel was polite yet once again not friendly. We did ask for fresh towels and toiletries since we keep the ""do not disturb"" sign on the whole time during our stays, and it was brought up quite quickly. There was an issue with our sink being clogged when we first got to the room, it was addressed right away, although the lady which answered the call said she's not sure when they can get up there because she wasn't sure how many other tasks they had to perform, once again not friendly. What bumped this review from a 3 star to a 4 star one is the guy who attended us at check out. They take a $200 deposit for the room if you are paying with a debit card and not a major credit card, but you can use that to cover things that you charge to your room during your stay, so I wanted to make sure to do an in-person check-out to look at the bill and what I had spend. I'm pretty sure the guys name was Nui. I overheard the lady in front of us giving him attitude and speaking rudely to him, and despite that he greeted us with the friendliness I did not experience throughout the hotel during my stay. He was cheerful, chatty, asking us about our trip and how it went, advising us about luggage storage and asking us if we needed transportation without us asking. He inquired about our stay and we mentioned the cable going in and out every 15 mins, we were quite nice about it. He was apologetic and explained that they upgraded their system and its possible there's an issue with the wires not being all the way in. Because of that and him seeing the plumbing issue in the beginning of the stay he gave us a refund of $136 although we had used the full $200 charging things to the room. It was unexpected and such an amazing gesture to compensate for our small inconveniences. It's very seldom that everything goes 100% perfect when you are staying at such a big hotel for a period of 5 nights, but it is service like that that separates a 4-5 star hotel from the other ones. I wish you guys could clone Nui. Customer service is so important and he really did made me feel like the MGM is a place I would like to come back to. This review was written solely because of us running into Nui, and although it ended up very long, its all really a compliment to him for his great service.",0,0,0

The food choices are OK - if you have $80 to spend on dinner every night..then the restaurants at this hotel are great. If you only have $10...you're in trouble. $10 will get you a cup of coffee and doughnut from Starbucks downstairs. Gambling is obviously high on the strip too.
The pool costs money to go to also. I think the only free thing here to do is to visit the Lion Habitat - where poor lions are displayed in faux environments behind glass for you to see.

If you are looking around for the right place to stay in Las Vegas you just need to know that the MGM Grand is reliable and has a bit of everything for all different types of people. 

You can bring your family here for vacation, you just need to know where to bring the kids and what palces to avoid. Even by the pool you can kind of feel out where the familys are and where the single wild groups are camped out. 

If you are looking to party you have Wet Republic which is insane and Studio 54 is still a solid nightlife choice. Tabu is a solid lounge choice if you are not looking to go crazy dancing. 

The food is excellent, the buffet used to be legendary but i had to take it down a notch for my last stay(spring break 2011), the food quality was still good but not what it used to be. 

Good spots on site include Diego for Mexican, Tom Colliccio's Craft Steak, a diner that serves breakfast all day and so many other options like the Rainforst Cafe that's open till the wee hours. They have Starbucks on property.

The basic room has plenty of space and they still have the old MGM movie posters on the walls, nothing spectacular at this point but clean and comfortable. The bungalow suite is a good bet if you are going to party because there is a ton of room to hang out. 

The all-time best thing to do is buy a $22 ""yardstick"" pina colada or strawberry daquori, which is 32 ounces and comes with $11 refills, sit by one of the the seven pools, lazy river or waterfall all day and enjoy!

The pool area is massive with the only lazy river in all of Vegas. There is a great gym included in your resort fee but some hidden costs to use the spa facilities or rentals for the tubes on the lazy river. 
Expect to wait a long line to check as with most Vegas properties. Parking is free and valet is on a tip basis. It's much better to consider valet. If you are around long enough head on over to TV City where you can get paid to do surveys related to tv as long as your qualify. Starbucks is also 24 hours.

So I haven't seen the finished product.  But I did stay in a newly remodeled room, so I can go off that for now.

What can I say about the MGM...

Well, the lobby is huge and they have two huge and beautiful screens for you to watch music videos and tweets.  Actually, when we arrived to check in, the Billboard Music Awards were taking place there that night.  So we watched a little of the red carpet up on the screens, which was cool.  The lobby looked like it needed a bit of updating when compared to the newer hotels like the Aria and the Cosmopolitan.  Actually, the whole hotel could use more remodeling, but they are in the process of remodeling so I'm not sure what it will see remodeled in the future.  The MGM does have some nice restaurants like Joel Robuchon and Craftsteak, and there are nice quick places to get food such as Starbucks and McDonald's.

Our room was okay.  We stayed in the newly renovated Grand King, which was nice but small.  I liked the blackout shutters and the TV, but the bathroom was small and not very impressive.  Also, the minibar is set up like a trap.  If you remove anything on the minibar or in the refrigerator, they will charge you.  If you accidentally move anything and put it back, they will charge you a restocking fee of $55.  That is just ridiculous!  Especially when coming from the Trump, where no such charge or concerns exist!  The room was new, so I'm sure in a few more months there will be a smoke smell to it.

The thing that I liked the most about the MGM is their lazy river.  I just like lazy rivers, period.  And the MGM was a good sized lazy river, so I can't complain.

I would probably not come back to the MGM Grand to stay.  There are just too many better options in Las Vegas to stay, so to me it isn't worth it.  Maybe after they finish their renovations, the MGM will look better.  But to be honest, what renovations that I did see didn't really impress me.",1,1,1

A cheeky email a couple of days before got us an upgrade before we'd arrived.

We opted for the Primo offer during check in. We knew we'd easily spend the money between 5 of us in two rooms and so the added perks were effectively free! We were offered another upgrade as a result too!

The rooms were great. Huge in comparison to some on the strip. We're not too fussy so we were happy campers. Our rooms were next to each other too, which helped.

Being a huge resort, the MGM really does everything you need in it, to an extent. The range of food, drinking and gambling options is immense and it helped the Primo perks were extended to the other MGM owned properties on the strip too.

The rugby sevens were a great addition to an already exciting town. Rugby, gambling and drinking in Sin City? The perfect combo for us!

It has moved a short distance from where it was but you can still here the horses trotting around the track while walking through. The layout of the casino is decent as well.

I've stayed here a couple times and gambled here a handful of times. I've always been pleased with the experience. The Las Vegas Strip is inundated with first-class hotels and casinos, but this one still remains a favorite of mine.

The only thing that holds me back from giving them a full 5-star rating is the room rates. They're significantly higher than many of the other hotels nearby. Given, MGM does seem to be just a little bit nicer in decor, I don't think it justifies such a dramatic hike in room rate.

That aside, I have can't find anything to complain about. They have just about every game or slot you can imagine, the buffet is good, their ""Centrifuge Bar"" is a lot of fun, and the service is very good. Don't forget to check out the Lion Habitat as well.

The basic rooms are adequate in size. Not huge, but spacious enough. Plumbing issues (slow drains or weak water preassure) and sometimes being able to hear your next door neighbors ""getting it on"" might be the only issues I've come across. But I find this to be the case with all hotels I've stayed at in Vegas. So I accept this to be the ""norm"". Personally, I spend very little time sleeping while I'm in Vegas so the rooms don't bear a lot of weight in my review.

Just being in Las Vegas is awesome and I look forward to my next visit to MGM Grand (whenever I can afford it).",2,0,1

We only stayed there one night, but it wasnt something to remember for sure. The ice machine on our floor didnt have ice....so I went to the 21st floor, to which also smelled like a sewer, and found ice. Went back to our room trying hard not to smell the nasty rotten egg-like pungent odor......but realized the smell had traveled into our hotel room......

The marble in the bathrooms were either low quality or definitely not maintained. They looked dingy and flat in appearance. When I think of the MGM ""Grand"" I expect ""grand""..........so the day we checked out, we made a complaint and well, they gave us free buffet....for 3. $75 value but the buffet was DISGUSTING!!! Grabbed about 7 diiferent items and pretty much told the waiter to take the entire plate away. The pizza was the best part, even though it tasted like pizza from a 7-eleven.

Service was great for the most part (exception was when I reported broken hinge on armoire - see below), but our room was terrible.  

The first night there was an awful jet-engine sound somewhere outside - no idea where or how, as we were on the 27th floor.  Additionally, the ventilation system was horrible, we could smell smoke (non-smoking floor) AND smelly whory perfume.  We were supposedly upgraded to a suite, but this was no more than a slightly large room.  

When we got to the room immediately after checking in, I noticed that the armoire had a broken hinge.  Not wanting to be charged for it, I called the front desk to report the problem.  The woman I spoke with was quite rude and told me that I wouldn't be charged for it and that she was pretty certain that engineering already know about it but that she would report it AGAIN (my first time calling about it).  We kept our ""privacy"" sign on the door since I spread my work out all over and basically we're messy and didn't want anyone to see our mess until we're ready to pack it up....however, engineering felt it necessary to come in and make the repair despite the ""privacy"" sign while we were out.  

I figured since we were ""upgraded"" the room would have a fridge and\/or coffeemaker or some kind of amenities for people not interested in spending $500 per meal.  Nope.

The casino was filled with the most clueless and sheltered people on the planet.  For crying out loud people, it's just Vegas - don't get out much?  No need to take a photo of EVERY damn thing!  Or stopping mid-walkway for no reason other than to stand there and look around.  Get out of the way!  Some people have places to be!

The pool was a million miles away and wasn't really all that exciting - especially since the frozen drinks were SO expensive and we couldn't find a cocktail waitress to save our lives.  Since I was there to work, I found it very distracting and annoying that it was so loud at night CONSTANTLY.

The check-in process was time consuming.  Even though we got in at 11:30 PM, there was still a long line that went past the ropes and it took us about 45 minutes to go through the line.  We had a pleasant check-in experience with the front desk concierge, who kindly upgraded us to a bigger room for no extra charge.

The hotel itself tries to do aroma marketing, but it's way too strong.  The smell reminds me of a mix of Chanel No. 5 and vanilla.  Our room was located at the North Tower, and there were no actual signs on the boards that lead us to the tower.  We had to ask two associates before receiving the correct directions.

Our room was a little small for Vegas standards and the bathrooms were even smaller (with only one sink for 2 queen beds!).  The mirror was the best thing about the bathroom because it had great lighting. (A plus for the ladies!)

The reason I picked this hotel is because I had stayed here in the past with great location to everything, plenty of places to choose from when eating, and easy to get around everywhere.

However I went there with my honey and it was not the experience I was hoping it would be.  He had been away for a long time and I missed him, I wanted it to be special.

Check in was easy but my goodness they charge so much for early check in by a few hours.  The room was already empty and clean, all I wanted to do was take a shower before my sweeties flight landed.  I wanted him to see me refreshed and not sweaty and gross.  I accept the charges and they give me my keys for the room.  At first glance it's clean and big, I pull the blinds and to my horror it is not overlooking the strip like I requested.  Turns out the Tower Spa Suites don't overlook the strip at all and there was this big ugly building blocking my view.  The parts of the building that weren't blocking the few, you got to see a nice view of an ugly parking lot of hotel cars and golf carts, along with the roof of a neighboring building.  I closed the blinds back ASAP to hide the mood killing view.

I showered, got dressed, and laid down for a few moments to take a nap when I heard a terrifying noise coming out of the bathroom.  The shower started leaking water on it's own, almost as if someone was trying to turn it on.  This water going on and off by itself happened the whole weekend stay there.   Not to mention the AC was broken in our bedroom, the heat was so bad my man decided he wanted to sleep on the couch in the living room.  I'm use to heat so I said in the bedroom as the couch wasn't comfortable and wasn't big enough for us both.

How great to plan a romantic and fun weekend only to end up spending it alone on the first night.  Next day we complained to the front desk and they said they would send someone up around 2pm.  I didn't fuss about the time because we were going to be gone until the sun went down.

When we returned to our room it was much cooler inside, the AC was finally working!  But come night time again and the AC starts howling and making unusual demonic possessed noises.  The noise is so loud in the bedroom our options are to turn off the AC and be hot or turn the AC and sleep in the living room with the bedroom door closed to try and muffle the sound out.  We picked option #2 which again killed the romance of it all.

I think when you spend thousands on a hotel room your view should be better then a dirty parking lot and roof, and you should have working showers and AC systems.

The only upside was the rooms were clean as always.  I've never been unhappy with the cleanliness of a room while staying there.  And the noise level was zero, from any outside rooms.  Not sure if it was due to us being the last room down the hallway, quiet neighbors, or if it was just the noise of the AC was so nice and loud you couldn't really focus on anything else.

They offered me two free nights if I pay for the first two nights.  I'm honestly not sure if I'll go back and give it a try or if I'll opt to try a different hotel next time.  We shall see.",1,0,0

Pros:
- Decent price up front.
- Close to the airport.
- Maid service always did a great job.
- Employees were helpful checking in and out.
- Multiple GORGEOUS pools with many bars outside.
- Loved having the huge variety of restaurants available in the hotel, from McDonald's to Craftsteak, multiple Starbucks and everything in between. 

Cons:
- Had to pay a mandatory fee per day when checking in for, Wi-fi, phone calls, and a newspaper to delivered to your door daily (which we NEVER received). 
- Had a TV in our bathroom area, it did not work.
- Had a leak from our shower in to the bathroom area.
- Ironing board was broken.

Had two rooms:
2 Queen room was gorgeous! 
1 King room felt a bit tight but it was cozy (the lights dim and they have mood music lol) 

We booked our reservations through AAA. When we got there they had us down for two king rooms. Thankfully we were there early, so they were able to switch us to one king and 2 queen room and waive the fee. I guess AAA messed up on this part, but MGM was able to fix it even though it was a holiday weekend and they were booked solid.

Hotel Staff:
-They had a ton of employees checking people in so the line went wicked fast, especially since it was a holiday weekend. 
-Literally all of the employees (even the housekeepers and maintenance crew) say hi to you. Everyone on the staff is so nice and welcoming.

There are so many amenities that I can't even list all of them. The experience is just so cool!

Parking: 
Hotel guests have to pay for parking, which is pointless and unfair in my opinion.

Check-In: 
When our group finally arrived, all I could say was WOW.... What a line. I have never stood in a longer line in Vegas for hotel check-in. We waited for over 1 hour before we reached the front. They were fully staffed, though, so I'm sure they were trying their best, but perhaps MGM should consider ways to improve operational efficiency and output. I will award one of my stars for their excellent service to the guests waiting in line. They continuously and sincerely apologized and offered water to everyone in the queue. 

Once my boyfriend and I got to the front after that grueling wait, an employee (I believe her name was Ann) had told us our entire reservation had been cancelled (we had previously only wanted to cancel one room). We were freaking out until another employee helped us out by searching for the reservation with the last name and first name reversed - which worked! I didn't get his name, but thank you to him for being clever enough to try a different tactic which saved us from a complete nightmare (take notes, Ann). 

Rooms: 
The rooms need some serious upgrading (actually, the entire hotel could use some renovation). The design is old and there initially was a weird smell (moth balls? *shudder*)  when we first got inside. Bathrooms were above average with great lighting, but that's about it. Our room was poorly lit and some lights also didn't work. We also had a beautiful view of the adjacent Motel 6 and Hooters (not). 

Check-Out: 
We struggled to use the check-out function on the TV. It lagged and lagged until it finally said that the system was unavailable. Why bother to have an easy check-out system if it's not going to be functional?!

MGM Grand is not so Grand, unless you like second-rate rooms, paying for parking, and waiting in lines longer than those of Disneyland rides. Avoid.",4,2,2

I don't know if it was cleaned or not but I just flushed and kept it moving hoping the cleaning crew just dropped it in and forgot to flush.

I had to call the front desk and was switched to another room across the hall. I told them this is not what I expect from the MGM. The next room was cleaner or so I thought. I was exhausted. I checked the drawers and toilets and it was ok. When I woke up, I found candy pieces on the floor and in corners and my bedding had what looks like food stains on it between the duvet covers.

I've always been a fan of cinema and old Hollywood. The pools at this place are beyond awesome as well. Take your pick, I always lose count of how many they have. Plus the lazy backlot river, which is always fun. The buffet and restaurants are all delicious, I dont ever remember having a bad meal.

I'm a huge germaphobe so I'm a stickler when it comes to grit in the shower, stains in the restroom and stained linens. 

None of which were present at MGM. I give the cleanliness of the room as a whole 5 Stars. Furniture was a bit dusty but I can live with that, it was only lampshade and backside of desks and nightstands. 

Hallway did not smell like smoke what so ever and carpet was clean (on the 10th floor). Placement of furniture wasn't weird (ie, no blocking of any doors when closet was opened).

Here are a few issues: 

-The shower pressure was super slow, more than doubled my time to wash my shoulder length hair. 
- Our room was located right above Valet drop off (facing airport) ang though the view was beautiful, we can hear every ones voices outside CLEARLY. The laughing, giggling and all.
- AC stayed at what felt like 80 degrees even though we had it turned down to the highest speed at the lowest temp.

Pros - location.  On the strip and a monorail stop. Poolside cabana service is worth the price.  I recommend the Reviv pool cabana if you want a smaller, quieter, adult only experience.  

Cons - virtually everything else.  Room was adequate.  Temperature never cooled down. I booked 2 rooms.  The other was quite cool.  Bathrooms throughout the hotel common areas were dirty, smelly and in need of repair.   Casino-adequate but the cocktail waitresses left something to be desired.  Tried three different restaurants within the hotel.  All were fair to good.  Wolfang Puck's ranking the lowest.  Meatballs were bland and flaborly. Food court offers some of the most outrageous pricing on subpar food $6 plus for a SINGLE slice of pizza.  Starbucks locations (3) were among the worst I have ever experienced.  Security was lacking. Reported an incident in the food court but had to go all the way to the security desk in the casino.  In addition, I had the Do Not Disturb hanging my door but housekeeping came in anyway. The air handling system in the casino was poor as the whole place smelled like an ashtray.

The pros: the marvelously comfortable bed, the spacious room, the nice flatscreen TV.

The hotel and casino were both beautiful.

The cons: the food options in this hotel were disappointing and we chose not to eat there over the span of our 5-day trip. The only coffee option is Starbucks. The hotel is not nearly as cool, fun, or activity-filled as other hotels (such as the Bellagio with its water show or the Caesars with it's Chinese New Year garden and shops). THE HOTEL CHARGES A $20 RESORT FEE, WHICH PURPORTEDLY IS FOR THE WI-FI AND SOME OTHER NONSENSE. Oh, and you no coffee maker in the room, obviously so that you'll go spend money on coffee downstairs at Starbucks. 

Additionally, the free wi-fi internet was spotty and slow, the concierge and front desk failed to pick up our phone calls on more than one occasion and we had a RIDICULOUSLY long walk to and from our room on check-in and check-out days.

I stayed in one of the Stay Well suites this time. It boasts amenities like blackout shades, aromatherapy, air purifier, and vitamin c shower. 

The aroma therapy device didn't seem to be very powerful, you could only smell it if you out your nose right in front of it. The vitamin c shower didn't feel any different than a normal one, and I didn't really notice a difference in my skin or hair, but it's hard to tell.

Two things are a definite plus about being in the Staywell suite:

1) there is a separate check-in at a private off-lobby lounge. We were immediately helped and didn't have to wait in the massive line with everyone else 

2) free admission to the spa and sports center, which usually costs $25 per day. 

The spa facility has two saunas, locker room, relaxation room and massive hot tub.

Also paid for the open bar which was $90 a person. We were told by the concierge that the doors open at 5 o'clock at the MGM grand ballroom, which turned out to be their conference room.
  Didn't get in until almost 6. There was absolutely no organization at all while we were waiting in line to get in. People are walking in front cutting, no security, nobody cared. 
 Finally got through security, and walked over to where the open bar was for the people that purchased the bar packages and the lines were atrocious. I get it was a big fight and that we were not the only ones there but it took us almost 45 minutes to get our first round of drinks. So we ordered two each. The drinks came in the smallest cups maybe 6 ounces, and the tickets had said the gratuity was included however I always tip bartenders and food servers, since I am in the same profession. We gave the bartender 20 for the night so we wouldn't have to keep going to get change for tip. 
  After we found seats, I went back out to stand in line to get food. I took the hotdogs back to our seats, went to use the restrooms, and there was a long line... so after I decided to get another round of drinks. I left in the second round of the second fight and didn't get back to our seats with our drinks until the first round of the third fight. This time the drinks were put in larger cups and I told (bartender) that I'd already given the (bartender) next him $20 for the night and he actually asked the other bartender did she give you $20 she said she did. Number one why would I lie about that, and number two that had to be one of the tackiest things I've ever seen since as I stated before our tickets it said the gratuity was included. Since the bars were scheduled to close at the beginning of the main event (STUPID) my fiancé went up to get a couple of more drinks and barely made it back for the start of the main event.
 This was by far the most disorganized, biggest rip off and disappointing venue that I have ever attended a fight in Vegas for.
 All in all, even if the drinks for even $15 each they made about $30 in tips extra off of each of us for what they charged us for the open bar.

You can pay a little extra for early check-in and late check-out, which we were told a few times wasn't guaranteed.

Half-awake and desperate to check-in at 9:00AM, it was Jeepett at the front desk who was our saving grace.  She was so personable and accommodating -- it made the morning so much easier.  She is reason I'm giving the hotel five stars instead of four.

Our room was spacious. It had a sort-of view of the Strip (not what we expected but still decent-ish).  The linens were clean, the bathroom was clean, the beds were comfortable.  There was no safe, which was a little upsetting, but it seems like they're still renovating various parts of the hotel, so it might be something they plan to add later...

The hotel itself has a lot of great features.  There are a lot of places to eat and drink, the casino is fairly large, and there are several pools to choose from. If you'd actually like to go into the water, I would strongly suggest avoiding Wet Republic.  Also, Wet Republic's food\/beer\/water prices are obscene -- the regular pool area costs WAY less and you can still hear the music.

First of all we had booked this hotel 7 months in advance. However when we arrived we were told that it was a first come first serve basis and because we arrived late at night ""we were lucky that there was one room left on the first floor because of a huge conference they had at the hotel"". The room was right off the casino floor so stunk of cigarette smoke  and when we open our window we saw a brick wall. Welcome to Vegas! We went back and complained to front desk who clearly didn't understand the word ""reservation"" and managed to get a new room on the13th floor (yay great omen for winning lots in Vegas!) 

Now to the middle of our stay. The whole 13th floor smelt of sewage- actual faeces and garbage- that no one else seemed to concerned about (??) and our room smelt of vinegar. Our window which had a better view that then brick wall, now didn't have block out curtains on them, so at night our room was lit up like a green light box. Our room was barely made after house keeping (toilet paper not replaced, no new face washers). 

End of stay. We go to check out and find all these additional charges to the room. So called ""amenity fees"" of $150 that everyone failed to mention  to us- even after we had specifically asked them if there was anything else we would be charged for at the beginning of the trip as we had paid up in advance.

I can't imagine they wash the comforters every time, and a sheet on top and below the comforter does not make me feel very secure that I don't have someone else's DNA in my bed. 

Service earned maybe a negative star. 

First, I couldn't get the wifi to work. I called the number on the card in the room and waited on hold maybe about 5 minutes. When someone picked up she informed me she would transfer me to the wifi help desk. Why didn't the number on the card send me there??? This number said my expected wait time was two minutes. It was actually a nine minute wait time. The wifi was fixed and all was fine. 

When we got back to the room at 2 am we were hungry and decided to order room service. I called the number and waited. Meanwhile, my boyfriend took a shower. Then he got on the phone and I took a shower. Then we both sat and waited some more. He hung up after over 15 minutes on hold and called immediately back. Someone picked up right away. Obviously they had forgotten about us. Room service said there was no card on file so we had to pay cash. When I called the front desk I was told because it was a debit card room service couldn't see it, but they should have told me to call the front desk, which they didn't.

There were 10 of us in the group so at $89\/each we ended up spending $1K just on tickets. That doesn't include any alcohol and come to find out, does not in fact guarantee a seat. You are basically paying about hundred bucks just for a spot in line. After waiting for half an hour or so, we were approached (in the restroom no less) by a Mad House sales rep offering us a table and bottle service. Since it was a special occasion and we wanted to be sure our friend had a great night, my boyfriend picked up the tab. Two bottle minimum which included mixers and a booth at the very back of the theater, for $1500.  All of that was fine (of course it's a rip off, we expected that), until about an hour into the evening when one of the girls in our group left to use the restroom.

The booths sit on a raised platform and the back of the theater was almost pitch black; when she stood up to go to the restroom she missed the ledge and slid on ice from a drink someone had spilled in front of our table that had not been cleaned up.

My boyfriend spent nearly an hour lobbying for her to be allowed to re-enter (by this point everyone has completely sobered up and the mood is ruined anyway, not to mentioned we've missed most of the show), to no avail. 

Just to summarize, we spent about three grand total for this ""performance"" only to miss most of the show, be told that our friend was too drunk to come in (how is it even possible to be too drunk to get into a club on Satruday night in Vegas--especially when you've paid for bottle service??), and generally be treated as second class citizens, the most disturbing part was how rude and disrespectful the bouncers\/staff were. They openly mocked my friend while she waited outside the theater, (""guess you should have learned to handle your liquor,"" laughed in my boyfriends face when he pointed out that we were spending a fair amount of money, and  generally seemed to take perverse pleasure in ruining the evening for everyone.

I had always heard that the staff and service at MGM were sub par and this experience did nothing to persuade me to feel otherwise. We spent several thousand dollars on a show we barely saw, drinks we apparently should not have actually drunk because heaven forbid(!) someone become intoxicated in the club, and  an overall atmosphere that wasn't even that fun. Whether you're looking to spend $100 or $3000, I'd highly recommend avoiding Beachers Mad House at all costs.",0,0,0

The room was adequate, not the best in Vegas but not the worst. 

Paranoid complaint, I need to just start calling down and have them remove the shit. They have a little pad next to the TV with crap on it, like a $30 USB cord, that if the stuff gets moved you get charged for it plus a $50 restocking fee. I saw these when I stayed at the Bellagio as well. I have never had anything happen, but I would hate to bump the stand in the middle of the night and get charged more than the cost of the room for crap I would never buy. 

The entire hotel has a smell about it, it is a sickeningly sweet vanilla fragrance that hangs in the air everywhere. I would almost prefer the smell of smoke over that. 

The room had a noisy air conditioner that sounded like the compressor was a diesel engine about to stall out. 

Constantly while we were trying to get around they had staircases closed for cleaning and aromafying. 

Worse, I was there for a convention, which provided meals. These were awful. There was nothing good to say about the food there. I cannot say if they were trying to get people to eat at their restaurants instead, but wow it was bad. When we did eat on our own, it was not at MGM Grand restaurants. 

Starting with Day 1 lunch, some soggy sandwiches, I took  ""thanksgiving"" which is the new popular turkey with stuffing and cranberry. Not really good by any measure. Seemed like they had been sitting for a long time. 

Day 1 dinner - Black tie - So they come around and sit down trays on the tables, WTF family style black tie event, that is a first. So we are sitting at 10 tops and the platters have 2 tiny pieces of beef and 3 pieces of chicken, the table gets 2 platters. Plus a small bowl of mashed potatoes that I could eat myself. When we asked for more the server gave us grief, but eventually provided more meat and potatoes. 

Day 2 breakfast - convention eggs, you know the scrambled egg mix with no taste, bacon, sausage, and a peach pancake casserole. 

Day 2 lunch - more sammiches... didn't eat any.

Day 2 dinner - buffet style taquitos, carved roast beef and turkey & stuffing, This was the best meal of the trip

Day 3 breakfast - soggy croissant breakfast sandwiches with a little bit of scrambled egg and a little piece of bacon or a chibatta with a little egg and sausage. 

Everything was pretty bland and tasted old.",3,2,2

When we got settled into our gigantic new suite, the beds were amazingly comfortable and the TVs have plenty of input options. Relaxing in the room between Vegas adventures was a delight. You can completely black out the room with the automatic blinds on the windows which makes sleeping in after a long night easy.

The outdoor Pools are pretty awesome as well. There's a tube run that takes you around a large area through waterfalls and misters.

after that kurfufle, check in went pretty smooth. we were able to get a room key in a couple hours. we didn't try to get to the room, just grabbed a drink and hung out for a bit, waiting for the line to die down. after dropping off the bags, headed to pool and spent the rest of the morning there.

we got a west wing room which was pretty modern and chic. unfortunately, there was no sink counter area for mama. that part really irked her. room and bed were pretty nice. shower and toilet were separate and fancy. the hallways were pretty freaking long and you had to commit to walking it cause there's no turning back. luckily, elevators were fast and not ever full. 

the MGM affords a lot of options for both dining, drinking and good times. our second night we pretty much didn't have to leave the property for anything.

But the staff treated my son like he had won an Oscar. Everyone was kind, solicitous and funny with him. We got an upgraded room with (at my son's request) a 12th-floor view of the airport and monorail which he adored -- not too high, not too low, and directly over the grand port-au-cochere, where he could watch the comings and goings of the limos. He sat by those huge windows at dawn and dusk, noon and night, whenever we stopped by the room, to soak in. Everything we wanted to do was within so short a walking distance -- like the M&M show, the Coca Cola museum, the Hershey store and the roller coaster at New York, New York -- that it was doable even in the 113 degree heat. For more far-flung adventures, like the High Roller observation wheel and the awards dinner itself, we used day passes for the monorail which connects right to the hotel; you only feel the heat during the 7 minutes you stand waiting at the platform for the next train.

Another thumbs down is they failed to mention that they limit you to certain places you can spend it, & do not give you a list. Because we were having fun elsewhere, we've lost $50 so far. Another stupid rule is they will charge a restocking fee of $50 if you use the fridge. After I posted this review my Bf also mentioned that they only comped us for $50 after spending extra $$ gambling & the tub filling up while showering. They did fix it, but after them coming by twice. We almost bought drano & did it ourselves. Another thing is they overbooked & we were given 2 queens instead of a king.

MGM has always been busy especially since we visit during a work convention. Valet looks busy but we arrived by airport shuttle so it was quick to get us in the lobby for check in. We also didn't need the bell service with carry-on baggage. 

The line for checking in was long. The staff members at check in as well as check out don't seem very experienced. It took a while to get things done with a lot of waiting since they needed approval for specific transactions. 

The first room we stayed in was at the West Wing Towers next to the Crush Bar. It was a long walk through the hallway before we reached the elevators and eventually to our room. It was a cozy room with a king-sized bed. There's an open bathroom with glass doors to the toilet and the shower only. A nice feature was the TV build inside the mirror. Overall, I would not request the West Wing Tower next time because it seemed small and there was way too much walking to get to our room.

The other nights were spent in the North Tower next to the Fiamma Ristorante. The room was slightly larger with a bathroom that had a tub, not just a stand-up shower. It was more convenient staying at the North Tower room since it's not the main tower where everyone else was crowded around, with floors to wait for (3rd floor was the highest). Another perk is that it's close to The District (for eateries), the Garden Arena, and the conference rooms.

Cleanliness in the rooms were average. There was nothing spectacular or noteworthy. I know it was a busy weekend due to the convention so there were long lines everywhere such as the check-in line, taxi line, bell desk line, and the eateries.",2,0,0

It was a last minute decision since we are fairly close and thought seeing some fireworks in Vegas and catching some shows would be nice.

My last review was not as favorable as this one and I will admit that I did return with some apprehension. I room was comped which was obviously nice especially for an expensive holiday weekend. The 4 stars is based upon me being open minded and attempting not to judge my past experience. In all honesty, there would reasonably be past judgements that influence my opinions both positively and negatively. 

For instance, the person that helped us at registration was very friendly and efficient. I realize I judge him as such because I previously had an issue at the registration desk. Nonetheless, he was very professional, greeted us with a smile and got us setup with keys in less than 5 minutes. Great job Jonathan! 

Overall, we love the MGM. Our favorite place to eat in Vegas is most likely Shibuya (inside the MGM and where we held our wedding reception). 

Ka is one of our favorite shows. See it! 

We've eaten at Hecho in Mexico, Pub 1842, Corner Cakes & more. All of the above was fantastic! 

I still haven't gone to the pool or any of the clubs inside of the hotel, but we aren't much into the party scene and it appears that the pool and Hakkasan are more than we'd want to experience on our trips.

We stayed in a Stay Well room and would probably request this floor the next time we return. I appreciated the non-smoking restrictions, the Vitamin C shower and the clean feel of the room.

My experience with MGM was atrocious.  We were lucky (?) to get one of the newly remodeled rooms, and it really is nicely designed and furnished.  The room was HUGE, the bathroom was HUGE, and everything looked really nice.  When the lights were working.

The bathroom lights had something wrong with the wiring, as they would trip out from time to time.  After being off for a while (cooling down) they would work again.  You can see how this causes trouble when maintenance tries to fix it.  They come when we're out, say the lights work fine.  We get back, have them on for 20 minutes while getting ready and POOF.  Awesome.  The patronizing little notes about resetting the outlet really helped.

Sort of on a tangent, but I don't like staying in a fancy schmancy hotel and finding random garbage in the drawers.  Ew.  What else wasn't cleaned?

And, the kicker.  The night we got to town, fiance was at another casino playing cards, and I was tired.  I head up to the room, try my key, and nothing is working.  I am tired, I am in heels, grrrrrrrrr.  So down to the desk I go.

This woman legitimately looked me in the eye and said ""that room checked in and out today.""  What?  Do you see the reservation?  It is not for four hours.  She finally gets some information from someone else, and tells me I have to go wait for security to let me into the room.

The costumer service. I know I am not a high roller but I had reserved three rooms  for two nights each so i expected some respect. Instead the girl at check in was rude and short.

It's a city in its own and you never have to leave if you can afford it. There are lots of entertainment options right on the property from Circque de Soleil, to a comedy club below the lobby. It has an arena with top acts currently touring the country appearing nightly.
     The rooms are very nice and the beds are soft and comfortable.
    It has a beautiful pool area with a lazy river.
It has many restaurants, some great and some greatly over rated. I found Emeral's in the latter catagory. Their Knob Hill bar served me an eleven dollar pair of ribs appitizer that had actually been fried into unchewable leather. The fish and chips in the coffee shop is excellent and I've never had a bad breakfast there and I've probably had at least fifty breakfasts there.
    If you're into night-clubbing they have Studio 54 and Club Tabu.

      A current downside (4\/4\/12 is that its undergoing renovation and the jackhammers start at 9AM.
      Room service is pricey and the wait is long. A pal ordered a shrimp cocktail and a beer and I think it was $50.
      The Will Call for the arena is untrustworthy. I left two tickets to the ACMA's for guests and when my guests got there the tickets had disappeared. Two other people were sitting in their seats.
       If you have a room with a door that adjoins another room you can hear the people in that room like they are in your room.
      I spent eighteen minutes on a house phone trying to get an operator listening to a recording tell me how much they cared about my business. The line eventually went dead without anyone ever answering. I was ready to rip the phone off the wall.
      A small but highly annoying detail: Bring your own moisturizer. They have these tall square bottles that don't squeeze easily. When you do squeeze hard enough to get some out, it all comes out. It looked like the money shot from a large animal in a porn produced by Animal Planet. I had conditioner all over my Dopp Kit, medicine bottles, the counter, the mirror. It was a big mess. They need to find the guy who designed that and kill him before he breeds.",0,0,0

This review is more about the hotel rooms and teh staff than the hotel as a whole. I will say that i went to their pool and it was ok. Nothing special. They have a lazy river but it is always overly crowded and sort of a meat market. The staff at the pool was nice and when there was a lighting storm they immediatley had every guest get out of the pool

I went to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party. We decided to stay at the MGM Grand because the cost for the hotel rooms were pretty decent.  We checked in on a Thursday. When we went to the front desk to check in, we immeditatley received horrbible customer service. The gentleman at the front desk was very unwelcoming. We asked if he would be able to upgrade us since it was my bachelorette party. He was able to do this for an extra fee. We decided to do this since it would end up being a larger room. He let us know that our card would not be charged until check out. (which he was incorrect about. I received a call from my fiancee why there was a charge for $800 about 5 minutes after we checked in. I had to straighten that out with teh front desk the next morning) He then asked us what our plans for this evening and we told him that we would be going to Tao for dinner. He gave us a disgusted look and told us that he had never been there but heard horrible things and that our dinner choice was a bad one. We then asked if he had any suggestions and he did not respond. He handed us our room keys and that was it.... nice was to start the weekend. 




We went up to our room and we were blown away by how HOT our room was. I ran over to air condition and saw that it was on the coldest and highest setting. We thought since it was a larger room, maybe it needed more time to cool down. The lighting in teh hollywood suite was akso very, very dim. It was extremley hard to see much of anytihng in our room. We went out that night and when we came back, it was still so hot. it was compleltley miserable. On top of that, we could not locate the light switch to turn off the main light in the bedroom.It was about 4 am but we called the front desk in hopes that someone could help us. The woman on the other line was just as bad as the gentleman at the fron desk. She must have thought we were dumb, drunk people who were being stupid. I completley understand asking someone how to turn off the light might sound like a stupid question but we seriously could not find the light switch. We also asked her if she could send someone up to help us with our air condition as it was very hot in our room. She said someone would be up shortly...Well obviously shortly can mean very different times to different epople. A Half hour later we were still waiting for someone to come up to our room. We called about 5 more times and each time the lady would either tell us what we wanted to hear, hang up the phone or just transfer us to another department(i.e. house keeping, maintence or the food service...) very odd behavior for someone working in customer service. I get that they probably get alot of drunk phone calls in the middle of the night\/early morning but  if you have someone working at that time, then i would suggest they be helpful to the people paying to stay at your hotel. FINALLY someone came to our room by 5am. He searched and searched but he too was not able to turn off the light in the main room. He asked us if he could just break the light. He almost did until he called someone else and was able to find teh light swtich; which was behind the armour. He said he had never seen something like that. He also had no idea how to fix the air condition. Great...

After sweating through the night from the intense heat, we left  to talk to someone in person at teh front desk. A different gentleman  tried to help us with our air condition problem. He said someone would go up shortly and that we did not need to be in the room while he was fixing it...We decided to leave for an afternoon of shopping. When we came back the room was completley miserable! It was just so hot. We called teh front desk again and the woman suggest we move to anotehr room. Fantastic. So they moved us....right next door. The room was just as hot and miserable and the room was in worse condition: Lamps did not work, plugs were burnt out, furniture was broken and the air condition did not work. We then called the front desk to explain o ur dilemma and about 45 minutes later, anoterh maintence guy came up. He was in our room for about an hour and finally fixed the air condition.

Once in their regular grand room, once in their celebrity spa suite, and most recently a mix between their executive suite & their newly renovated grand rooms. Every experience has been enjoyable, but this most recent one I have enjoyed the most because I felt like the hotel  management went out of its way to make me felt welcome. At check-in, the manager introduced herself to me and shook my hand, and then consequently sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne, 2 Fiji water bottles, and a petit four. On another day, after my bedroom had already been made-up, I came back one evening to find a copy of my invoice summary waiting on the bedside table, and also to find that the room had been made-up again. Here are some notes about the hotel:

-The pool complex is humongous, and there are many different pools to choose from, in addition to the lazy river.

-The hotel contains its own monorail stop, as well as a Deuce \/ SDX bus-stop approximately in front of it

-The hotel contains a Fat Tuesdays, an awesome hole-in-the-wall slushy bar which is open late and is humorously one of the highest rated businesses on Yelp in Las Vegas

-The buffet is satisfying and contains both hot and cold crab legs, which have been split in half for you (no need to peel, fortunately!). On a busy weekend, I went on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm and there was nearly no line to get in. I was glad this buffet did not play any shenanigans with its line (some other buffets like Aria make you wait forever in line even when half the seating is empty). The variety, however, at this buffet is somewhat lacking.

-The in-room climate was very dry. No matter if the A\/C was on, or if it was off and the window ventilation was left open, the air inside was excessively dry and felt somewhat uncomfortable to breathe.

-The hotel not only charges a $25 resort fee, but also charges you several additional dollars on top of that (tax... on the resort fee)

Overall, I have a very positive, lasting impression of MGM Grand and I would come back to MGM, because there is great value here and there are so many different types of rooms to try out.",0,0,0

Lets start with location, which is at the beginning of the strip.  Its an optimal location if you intend on driving or taking a cab to another location because the street in front of the exit is not filled with boozed up idiots that can't figure out how to negotiate walking down the street and staying out of the drive ways.  
We got to the casino and the valet staff was accommodating and nice.  Check in was a breeze because they actually have 10 to 12 people checking you in.  
Our room was fantastic for the price we paid.  Comfortable bed, new carpet, bathroom that was totally upscale and appealing to the eyes.  Our view was of the mountain range rather than the strip, but I prefer that.  You can see the planes coming in and out of the airport.  The best part of the room was the shades, one which was sheer and would drown out a little light.  The other would black out the entire room even during the day.  They are quiet and cozy and perfect for relaxing after walking your butt off all day.
The hotel has many amenities and you would really never have to leave the place if you didnt want to.  Just remember EVERYTHING in there is expensive.  So bring your own water and be prepared to get raped by starbucks lol.

True to all the online reviews, a stay at the MGM Grand is a mixed bag. It's clear that this massively cavernous hotel has seen better days. You'll notice it in the small details like the vinyl peeling away from the wall in the bathroom area and the dirty carpeting in the hallways, as well as the larger facts of nearly deserted restaurants and gambling floors (until Thursday night, that is). 

And while it's to be expected during a stay in any Vegas casino hotel, the prices for anything ranging from a bottle of water to dinner are jaw-dropping. Absolutely jaw-dropping. TIP: As soon as you get to Vegas hit up a local supermarket and\/or liquor store to stock up on water, alcohol, snacks and even breakfast for your room -- but make sure these items don't require refrigeration as MGM Grand will also charge you to use the refrigerator. I mean, IF there's one in your room. You won't regret stocking up, particularly when you discover nasty little realities like an 8 oz. drink with barely any alcohol in it costing $15 by the pool. The restaurant experience at the Grand, while delicious, was also tainted by the astonishingly exorbitant prices. Breakfast for four one morning (sans alcoholic beverages, mind you) was $90+. 

But perhaps what hurt most of all was booking our travel package through Expedia (plane + hotel) for what we considered to be a reasonable rate, only to learn that an additional $100 per room was being tacked on at check in for ""resort fees."" One. Hundred. Dollars. Per. Room. The desk lady attempted to admonish us that this shock was our fault, as we had obviously not read the fine print. Correct, desk lady: when Expedia gave us our final total with the many taxes and fees clearly indicated, silly us, we assumed that was our actual final total, as has always been the case before with any other Expedia booking. Showing up for check in only to be told that we'd have to shell out $200 more than anticipated before our stay even began, well, that left more than a little bad taste in our mouths. Suddenly, the reasonable bargain vacation we thought we'd signed up for wasn't so reasonable anymore. Our plans for doing a little gambling went out the window right then and there.

And then, of course, despite this little bait and switch, we were still assigned crappy rooms in the run down and dated West Tower near the elevator (which I assume is where they stick the people who attempt to book bargain vacations, because we certainly don't merit their nicer rooms in the other tower). DING!  (all night long)  DING!   DING!! 

Exceptionally glad that none in our party handed them any more easy money on the gambling floor. Obviously won't be back.",8,7,7

When I went to the lost and found desk the lady questioned my knowledge of the bag in a rather rude way. I get that it was for security reasons but she was a bit rude about it. ""I MIGHT have that bag. What was the orange thing inside""? First of all, the item was Yellow. Second, don't fuck with me, just tell me if you have my stuff or not. (contents of bag are worth over $500). They made me wait overnight to get the bag back. She told me it was in storage and they can't get it out until 8 Am the nxt morning. Stupid.

The features of the room were a rip off. I'm talking about the minibar and snacks (optional, expensive). $32 for a tiny bottle of Grey Goose? $11 for the smallest can of Pringles you have ever seen? A can of coke for $8 when there is a vending machine down the hall that has bigger coke bottles for $3.50? Such a scam. Bathtub in room was tiny. I know we didn't pay for the best room, but still. I've paid less for a hotel room and gotten a much bigger and better bathtub with jets. I was allergic to something in the hotel body wash or maybe the sheets.

I personally love the MGM. I usually stay here when I travel to Vegas. 
Lets start with the beginning.

Every time I come to the MGM they welcome you to their hotel like you're home. They make the drive in so worth it. They always offer to help with my bags, but I don't take the help. 

The customer service at the front desk is irreplaceable. They are very helpful and nice. They've even upgraded me a couple of times!
The rooms are really nice and clean. The beds are super comfortable and the sheets and comforter are really soft and clean.
The bathrooms are nice and big, perfect size. 

The casino itself is really cool. There is a main bar which is in the middle of the casino, then a more vintage-ey bar in the front, by the front desk and then we call it the ""circle"" bar in the back... I think its called centrifuge. My favorite bar is centrifuge, but really all three bars are good.

The casino itself is usually pretty happenin. The craps tables are really fun to watch (i dont know how to play) and the blackjack and texas tables are fun as well. Don't feel dumb if you don't really know how to play, the dealers will help you. 

The food at the MGM is also very tasty. I've never had a bad meal there.

I know some people gave the MGM one star because they took their children there, or because their air conditioner wasn't working properly etc etc. and I totally understand how that can damper a trip, especially if it starts out bad.  But literally every time I've been to the MGM, I've had a superb experience.

My major number one complaint about this place, and it's probably something I can't get away from in Vegas, is the cigarette smell that manages to sneak its way into the non-smoking rooms.  I'm not sure if it's just seeping out of the walls from smoking days gone by, or if it's getting through the vent system or whatever the case is.  

The staff have always been attentive and friendly, and they are pretty organized here.  No troubles in that regard.  Price is decent. 

Still a long-ass walk to the convention center, but hey we all need our exercise.  They have a ton of stuff to keep you busy here, and you will not be bored.  Their gift shops have a pretty decent selection of items.

Room was as expected with a decent view. Elevators are smooth and quick with 4 available for a range of floors.
Restaurants are pretty good regarding availability options. I recommend the 'wichcraft, Wolfgang Puck, and the Grand Buffet.
Floor is very open with slots and tables. The signs are very readable to get to wherever you want to go. Note, use reference points\/places so you can easily to about. Even with the signs, I got lost a few times until I used the Lion habitat as a go-to point.
The pool is ok. Nice and sunny for tanning and relaxing. But quite the distance from the elevators.
Outside, by far one of the best and classiest hotels. Well lit and you can't miss it with its regal gold lion and green lighting.

Pros: Staff and customer service was great for the most part. The staff is friendly and very accommodating for the crap they have to deal with on a daily basis. 

Cons: 
1st room: Room is well loved, many different stains on the carpet and menus, Shower leaked a lot, maintenance came to fix the seal twice (no change), two days I asked housekeeping to add another towel daily when they replaced my towels (they never did), switched rooms since my neighbor's above me we're loud all day\/night for 3 days(I couldn't switch rooms since they were sold out), and sheets had ciggerettes marks all over it.
Bed had on huge dip like someone loves sleeping on that side for the last 5 years. I kept falling into it.

2nd room: Reeked of ciggerettes. Left room instantly it was so bad.

3rd room: Reeked of weed\/ciggerettes, bathroom fixtures were busted up, sheets had burn hole marks and ciggerette marks. Stayed over night since they were sold out. Towels has blood or feces stained into towel....

4th room: It was what one should expect for any hotel. Staff comped me for this room on my final night with them.

I know lots of the hotels on the strip are dated and have seen a lot of love over the years but it's gotta be better than the nastiness at MGM that's due to the customers that have abused the crap out of this place.",1,1,0

If you're considering booking a room at MGM, be sure to obtain a Mlife account and book via the Mlife site. The prices tend to be much cheaper. 

The MGM is on the south strip across from NY, NY and near Excalibur, Tropicana, Luxor (a bit of a walk) & Mandalay (a longer bit of a walk). There's also the M&M store complex area. To me, the area kind of plays off NY, NY for a city feel. You also have easy access to the monorail.

We have stayed at the MGM grand about 4 times in the past 2 years, and all stays have been pretty good overall.  Its a huge hotel, so unless you have been there before be prepared to get a lil lost...even the directionals are a little hard to follow sometimes.  

I am not a big fan of the west wing room....way too small and there is no privacy whatsoever.  We got upgraded to this room one time, and never again will we stay in this room.  I would only recommend that room for someone staying by him\/herself.  One morning I was trying to sleep past 8:00AM, yeah silly I know, and the person above us most of been getting ready for an interview or something.  They were pacing back and forth in dress shoes and I heard every step of it!  It didn't make my hangover go away any quicker!  

We normally stay in the grand tower room which is nice, especially for the price.  We always end up staying at this hotel because of the great deals they offer, like $50\/night with complimentary drinks and $50 fine dining credit.  The hotel has some great restaurants too if your into that, which we are, like Joel Robuchon, Craftsteak, Nobhill, etc.

Things I like about this casino:  its huge, lobby area (red roses everywhere), restaurant choices, blackjack tables are okay, great deals, rooms are pretty good.

I have stayed at the MGM every time I have ever visited Vegas whether it be for an event or just to celebrate or have fun with a significant other or with groups of friends.
This was the first time I encountered such bad customer service and such sub-par conditions.

First of all: the West Wing is just poorly designed. To enter the room, you have to walk through the bathroom area. There is no door separating the room and the bathroom. Just a frosted glass stall for each the toilet and the shower. This means A) you can hear (or smell) everything that goes on in the bathroom from anywhere in the room and B) if you want to use the restroom and leave the bedroom still dark, you had better use your phone to light your way. No separation! At all! The light brightens the entire space. Just poorly designed beyond belief. Looks modern and pretty but absolutely not functional. 

If you're traveling alone or with a heavy\/forgiving sleeper then it shouldn't be a problem. Anyone else?  Avoid it at all costs! 

Once past that: the cabinet under the TV was falling apart and a heavy wood piece almost fell onto my boyfriend when he walked by it. He didn't even have to touch it! 
The wallpaper is peeling (I mean, really?) -we can overlook this but it just added to the disrepair of the room. 
To go back to sleeping in the dark: the blinds were broken and wouldn't close all the way. You're in vegas. You should have working blinds!  Blackout preferred! 

We ended up going to the front desk to see if we could change rooms or at least get things fixed. It started really well with a very kind woman at the desk but  unfortunately, she passed us up to a manager who was rude and unaccommodating. He said he had no rooms outside of the west wing (fine, they're busy. I can understand that) and the only other rooms would cost us 200 more per night. We clarified that we should not have to pay so much just to have a working room. We explained we would at least like the issues to be addressed even if they didn't have another room available for us.  He was rude and didn't want to fix any of the problems in the room. He eventually caved and said he'd have things looked at....which never happened. 

It's extremely disappointing to go from great every single visit to such awful service and room quality.

For the most part, we received really friendly service at the front desk (+); however, we ended up spending way too much time at the front desk in the first place, because of MGM's mistakes (-).  We checked in really late, and were told our original rooms were not available that night (we just booked a regular room with two doubles)... as a result, we were getting a MAJOR upgrade to a two bedroom, two bathroom suite (++++).  This was great luck, and the suite was just baller...double doors entrance, bathtub with jets and 3 showers, etc.  

However, we were told that we had to switch rooms the next day.  The woman told me this at check-in, and that I could come in at any time the following day to receive my new keys.  But the following morning, I receive an annoying phone call informing us that we had to be out of the suite immediately... no communication there between customer service employees.  I had to tell them that we were told we could check into the new room at any time, and the woman on the phone just said ""Oh, okay""...overall, it was all just a hassle.  I get that we were getting a free upgrade so we should be appreciative, but it was just inconvenient to have to take the time and move our stuff to another room because of overbooking on MGM's part.  Also, the regular room we moved into was mediocre at best.  Walls were very thin, rooms smaller than expected, no full couch.

I probably walked 5 miles total going back and forth between our rooms and the front desk...first, they gave us the wrong keys, then the keys demagnetized, etc.  To compensate us for our troubles, they offered us free late check-out and complimentary buffets.  But then the rude employees at the buffet told us we couldn't use our comp!  At the end of our trip, we just said f*** it, let's go to In-n-Out.

Overall, I got tired of having to deal with the service people at MGM Grand.  I would have preferred to just check-in, and that be that.

I booked a Grand Tower room for several nights in Vegas and about the only thing I was pleased with is the room itself. It was very clean and everything was in decent working order. For this, three stars is fair as the room was not luxurious or top-notch by any means. Just a standard room.

Mobile check-in has potential but is annoying. You're supposed to be able to walk in, scan your QR code, get your room keys out of the machine, and walk away without any human intervention. However, there was a lady hovering around the area who insisted on getting involved and asking me to repeat answers to questions, etc. She also wrote the wrong room number in my key folder that caused me confusion when I got up to the floor. Her involvement in the process made it worse.

The casino is pretty dirty (cleaning staff ignore messes, piles of ashes sitting on gaming machines, etc.), it's hard to get drink service, and there are a lot of annoying drunk people on the floor. I also noticed on Friday night that there are a lot of ""ladies of the night"" skulking around looking for marks, and the staff seemingly doesn't have a problem with allowing this (or they aren't trained to recognize it; a problem either way).

1) To start with they did not have the room that we had reserved with a deposit when we arrived for checking. The clerk apologized and said she would upgrade the room for us. I said that's great but we requested a wheelchair accessible room for a reason and the ""upgrade"" room wasn't accessible. So we had to wait around at 2am while housekeeping rushed to get a room read for us.

2) We get to the room and it was rather small but after getting in from such a late flight we didn't care. The next morning I start to unpack our things and the entire closet smells horribly of weed....more on this point later.

3) I turn the water on to brush my teeth and there is no hot water....ok what ever cold water works, right?....Until I run the shower for 20 minutes and still cant get hot water in the room. 2 hours later engineering comes in and replaces our hot water valve and then says oh just let it run it will work now. It took me calling the front desk and engineering multiple times to get someone to come fix our hot water and we have lost half of the day.

4) Leaving we saw housekeeping working on the room next to ours and though ""oh good, they will do ours next"".....we come back early the next day and housekeeping never came. I call my friends at the front desk again very upset about this and they were just like well did you have the do not disturb sign on the door? I said no and not only that we saw them next door to us as we were leaving so there was no reason for them to not clean our room. So they sent up towels and agreed to have the manager call me at 11AM because of how upset I was over our visit.

5) So it is now 11:40 am and no call from the manager. I call the front desk and ask for the manager myself since it was too much for them to call me. I tell her everything once I get a hold of her and she does the same routine of asking if the do not disturb sign was on the door and then offers me an air freshener to get rid of the smell of weed in the closet. Seriously? This is your solution? I paid over $1K for a 4 night stay to be offered a car air freshener to get rid of the smell of weed in our closet? No hot water, no housekeeping, no club writs bands for free entry that is supposed to come with our Mlife membership cause the room that had them was locked. On top of everything I bring up that I was supposed to receive a call at 11AM and the manager tells me that yeah she sees that in the notes.....So the manager was notified to call me but just didn't give enough of a $%&* to follow through. I also had to fight tooth and nail to get them to refund the resort fees.

There is an excellent combination of restaurants- everything from fast food and pizza to top-rated restaurants. It was great!

Resort rooms are ok, large and comfortable.  But you can find that anywhere in Vegas.  Price may be an issue for Friday & Saturday nights.  

Don't forget it's Vegas and lots & lots of walking (night\/day) even if you're not planning on leaving the resort.  Why rent a car?  Unless you're there for biz.  If you share cab fares you'll save more and not run the risk of end up on Cops, Taxi Cab Confessions is more likely...  jeje

Did not do Studio 54 but Tabu was great, sexy\/hot and some stargazing is possible although pricey drinks for Vegas.  Great Dancers up on the stages\/tables but it can get a bit crowed at peek 12mid + pretty much every night, they close Tuesdays.   Check them out: http:\/\/www.mgmgrand.com\/nightlife.

One word to describe MGM GRAND and that is ""MASSIVE!"" That's right, this hotel and casino is one of the biggest hotels on the strip and formally in the world until the hotel in Thailand broke the record. This formally housed the, Wizard of Oz theme from 1993 - 1999 and ended it because the studio sold the rights to the movie. The only thing left that resembles the theme is the Emerald skin on the MGM hotel tower. 

Valet here takes forever to park and the registration area is huge! The check in clerk was pleasant and gave the upgrade skit as every other clerk I've encountered. We in the Grand Tower and it took about 5-8 minutes to get to the elevator from the lobby. Our room overlooked Excalibur, Luxor, Tropicana, and Mandalay Bay. The room was completely renovated and was impressed with the furnishings, floor to ceiling windows, comfy beds, and a high tech area to charge your gizmos. 

The casino is just as massive as the hotel and casino you can easily get lost unless you can read the signage. Pool is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel room and is layed out on a grand scale. Sadly, the lion exhibit is gone and replaced by TAP, Studio 54 is now Hakkasan, and they now have a 24\/7 café, called Avenue 24. 

Staff here are very friendly and most are all smiles. I did have a pleasant experience here it's just too big for my taste. Preferably I would stick with my home base hotel, the Mirage. MGM is nice to visit, I just wouldn't want to stay here again in this ginormous cluster!

The Mirage FTW!!",3,2,3

The room was dark, the carpet was musty & stained. The TV should be in the museum. The web bar drainage was clogged. The fridge is not cold, we can hear some weird noises coming through some pipes in the wall at night ... 
We went to the advertised Happy Hour, and after a long wait to be seated, we were only then told the Happy Hour is only for the bar area. 
The pools are nice but I got ripped off at the pool bar. I bought one of those huge margaritas (totally diluted down to sugar water) and was told I could get free refills; of course I found out the truth the next day when I went back for the refills.",0,1,0

Pros:
Complimentary fitness center with your ""Stay-Well"" room
Free apples and granola bars and water in the fitness center
The curtains in the stay-well rooms make the room pitch dark 24\/7

Cons:
Starbucks and every other restaurant has literally jacked up their prices by something ridiculous. My regular latte which is $2.95 at starbucks was $6 out the door here.
No coffee makers in the rooms
No microwave\/mini fridge in rooms

There are nicer hotels on the strip that I prefer to stay at.  However, if I'm looking to do it on the cheap or those hotels are booked out, MGM Grand is just fine.  Their cheapest room is a little too small for me - felt like I was in a cheap cruise ship room.  The $20 upgrade from the grand tower is well worth it!

I just sleep here - I haven't done the whole pool thing or treated it like a resort so I can't speak to that.  It does house the Craftsteak restaurant which does have the greatest steak I've ever eaten, so that's something in the win column.

You want to do the Vegas strip on a budget, MGM is a good option.",3,2,1

I generally try to save a few bucks and stay off site but, thought I'd give the MGM a try this year. I wasn't disappointed.  

With over 5,000 room, this place is enormous!  It is spotlessly clean and the rooms are good sized and very nicely decorated.  Each and every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. The service is top notch. 

There aren't many hotels with offerings so numerous that it's practically an entire vacation under one roof. With such a wide variety of things to do and see at the MGM Grand, don't be the least bit surprised if it takes more than one visit to experience it all. I know there are parts of the hotel I missed.  While large, the hotel is pretty well organized and easy to find your way around.

The pool area is pretty amazing. The lobby bar is a great spot to people watch, especially later at night.  Drinks aren't cheap but, nothing is in Vegas 

The choice of restaurants is varied.  From high end (think $200 or so for one) to McDonald's at the food court.  

Self and valet parking is free. Be sure to take advantage of the airport check in and beat the line at the hotel. They will also check your bags for you upon departure for a nominal fee. 

The only negative comment I have is that the wireless Internet service (which you pay for in your resort fee) is as bad as I've experienced at any hotel.  When traveling for business, this is important to me and the MGM fails badly here.

Rates vary dramatically depending on the day of the week, time of the year or current promotion so, it pays to shop around.  I've stayed at a number of hotels in Vegas and would place the MGM near the top of my list on a price vs. value scale.",0,1,0

MGM being one of the ""older"" hotels on the strip, we only hoped for a clean place to stay.

No bells and whistles but good enough to call it home for 2 days!

I only gave it 3 stars because I feel like every hotel on the strip needs to at least have a flat screen and mini bar or fridge. This room did not. Also, albeit clean with marble floors and accents, the bathroom showed the age of the hotel, as it clearly had not been updated very much at all.

We booked a room online, and their website says to show your AAA card at check-in for a discounted rate. Well, when I did just that, the girl at the front desk told me they can't do discounts at the front desk. I asked her where to do it online, and she told me you have to call in to get the discount. I said, ""Well, they don't make that clear online."" ""I guess not"", she said, and shrugged her shoulders. 

She put us in a room on the 3rd floor that could have passed as a closet. There was only one tiny window above the bed, the sink was the size of a drinking fountain, and there wasn't even a door into the bathroom. There is no privacy whatsoever. I do not understand why they even have rooms like this!!

On top of that, she did not even bother to tell us that there was construction going on the 1st floor of our wing. It took us half an hour to even find the wing, and then we had to take the only elevator that was open to the 4th floor (it only went up to the 4th floor. Why? I have no idea), and then we had to take the stairs back down to the 3rd floor. Isn't that considered some sort of fire hazard? 

This was the worst experience ever. We talked to three other people before they finally did something about it and ""upgraded"" us to a normal room. And they tried to make us pay an extra $30 for this upgrade! It took another 15 minutes of negotiating before they brought it down to $10. By that time I was just so over this whole experience. 

I am a long-time MGM customer, since I go to Vegas at least 3 times a year and they own half the hotels there. At this point, I'd rather stay in a Motel 6 than another MGM hotel ever again. 

By the way, I double checked their website and it doesn't say ANYTHING about calling in for the AAA discount. It clearly states to show your membership card during check-in.",5,2,1

Since I thought it'd be convenient to stay at MGM, I also booked a room - king size, non smoking. The prices for two nights were $149 (Friday night), $179 for Saturday night. They charged me $166. When I got there, I was told the room wasn't available. If I wanted, I got ""the option"" to upgrade (which I'd have to pay for). I got slightly upset, although I never raised my voice. 

I asked why I'm being charged $166 for something I'm not getting and why I was forced to pay for something I don't want? The manager came over and immediately said ""She's just doing her job!"" No s**t Sherlock! I'm not upset at the receptionist, I'm upset at the situation. Not fair to be charging customer for something he\/she's not getting. On top of that, they place a pending charge on your CC (for me, it was $500 pending charge). 

So they offered comp buffet and $50 off drinks. This is great for someone who eats at buffets and drinks, but I'm not a drinker and I don't eat at buffets, but when I said it to the manager, she said ""well, that's your only option."" In regards to rooms, they are spacious, clean. The TV was working occasionally, the bathrooms were nicely remodeled. I must say the concert was fabulous!

When I was checking out, I don't know what I was expecting, but I got ""how do you wish to pay for your bill"" question. This kind of floored me. So the rooms were $328 total minus the $166 charge (this would be around $162 total)+ the upgrade fee. You are already placing $500 charge on my CC, I guess I'm expecting you to say what you are going to give back to me. 

Anyway, long story short, the 2 nights cost me total $502. They charge you for upgrade you didn't want, they also charge your for something called ""remodeled room"", ""remodeled room tax"" (these charges are for every day you are staying) on top of your regular resort fee.

True, while the casino is older compared to other hotels on the strip, there is a nice quality to it. I wouldn't say classic...maybe homey? As homey as a casino can get. Does that make me sound like I have a gambling problem?! Moving on...

Personally, I have experienced solid customer service. For New Years we were put up on the 22nd floor overlooking the strip.

Instead of having a bathroom the toilet and shower are seperate by glass and you can see in each. Thank goodness we are married. You have no privacy and the rooms are so old and run down. The hotel is great, but $600 for 3 days is ridiculous.

Then, the cafe has horrible service and even worse food.  I'm not impressed MGM, we've spent a lot of money here this weekend, but we will not be back to your hotel.

So I am trying to recreate from memory.

First gave the MGM 1 STAR.  Check in was 45 minutes and this did not look atypical given the queues set up.  One I checked in I realized this hotel in EVERY was was trying to extract more money from me.
    NO fridge.  The had a completely stocked mini bar with items that automatically charge your room if you move them.   I asked if I could have a real fridge - you know the kind Motel 6 or Hampton in has the courtesy to give you complementary.  It would cost me an additional $25\/night.
   NO way to make hot water.  
   NO complimentary coffee.  I had to buy $4 starbucks cups.
In the morning it became apparent they had far to few vendors in the hotels.  LInes for breakfast were at least 30 minutes long - and for overpriced food to boot.

**********************************************

Updating review to two stars, as I now realize the behavior of this hotel is typical for the Las Vegas strip.  

Positives i didn't mention before were they let me connect 4 devices to the wifi and didn't have to reregister wifi each day.  Also price of room was not bad.",0,0,0

Huge disappointment. Check in line was 2 hours. Told by bellman to drop off bags and come back in two hours and it would be gone. Came back in 2 hours and told check in line was now 3 hours. Asserted my dissatisfaction and told I ""should have known"" before I booked the wait was very long at the MGM Grand. 

However due to unique business circumstances it was imperative I get to my room as fast as possible. I further confronted them about the situation. When that did not work I then raised my voice to the hotel employees. I started cursing and making a scene. I continued to raise my voice. The entire line started starting at me. That got their attention and they immediately moved me to the platinum line for fast check in. 

My room is literally a mile walk from lobby at the farthest end of the hotel. Cheap inadequate insulation means you can hear everyone's conversations on both sides of the room and many doors down in the hall. Internet didn't work. Fought with staff for hours before it worked. Console didn't work. Ethernet line didn't work. Constant noise from street. Ugly bathroom with ugly marble and a small tub. Staff explained they installed ""green"" shower heads to ""save water"" (in corporate speak =  save money) so there is wimpy water pressure in shower. 

Fighting with front desk all night. Huge dips in bed. Banged shin on bed foundation. Dangerous edges on bed with marks from drunk people banging shins. Woke up at 3am to mooing in my room. Realized it was just two old fat people having sex next door. ""Forced"" to hear every drunken disgusting detail (no sound insulation). Last but not least - there were com stains dripping off the corner the bed foundation. How disgusting! I took photographic evidence. . . 

And THAT is what I got for $300\/night.

I gave them a piece of my mind and checked out as fast as possible the next day. I then spent the next four nights at  LUXOR in an amazing room with Jacuzzi overlooking the strip. I will NEVER stay at the MGM Grand again!",0,1,0

We originally booked a King room. Upon check in we decided to pay for an upgrade to the newer renovated towers it was a couple hours before check in. The desk clerk said we would call when our room was available. We never received a call so we waited until after check in time. We arrive to our room and it wasn't clean. After waiting 20 minutes we walk into a room with 2 double beds. I call the desk and the clerk was like sorry you weren't told you were upgraded to a room with double beds. She could send us back to the original room I booked in the other tower. I told her I was disappointed. Especially since I paid for the upgrade. She replied with ""Well that's your opinion.""

And what a pool it is - the lazy river is a ton of fun.  They also have that ""club"" pool, Wet Republic, which attracts many a frat boy\/sorority girl.  Honestly one of the best hotel pools on the Strip, very hard to compare.

The MGM Grand is about 15 years old now.  Compared to the surrounding hotels, it's pretty dated.  But it's still a massive draw.  And a massive complex.  It will literally take you a good 20 minutes to walk from the parking structure to your hotel room (ok, maybe exaggerating a little bit - but it IS a bit of a walk.  Tack on an extra 10 for the pool)

The standard rooms are pretty decent; watch out for dirty towels, though, and the housekeeping service knocking at your door at an ungodly hour (at least for Vegas... I mean, 9am?  seriously?)  The beds are quite comfy though.  

There are 3 clubs of note - the aformentioned Wet Republic, Studio 54, and Tabu.  Of the three, we tried to go Tabu, which is considered the ""after hours club"" - we went at around 3AM on a Sunday, and the place was closed.  How can you be an after hours club when you're closed at 3AM? Granted, it was a Sunday, but still.  LV is the fucking city that never sleeps, just like New York.  What the hell?

Food options are great here - there's a Joel Robuchon restaurant, Tom Colicchio (of Top Chef fame) has both his Craftsteak and Wichcraft restaurants on the premises, and some others here and there.  There's even a food court with Nathan's, McDonalds', etc. in the ""Studiowalk"" area.

The only thing open was McDonald's. Nobody eats McDonald's. 
HousekeePing skipped us one of our three days and by the time we got back into the room late night it was too late to call for someone so we just let it go. 

We paid a daily resort fee for amenities. But yet we were charged additional fees to use the treadmills. So ridiculous. Total cheapskates. That is outrageously offensive.

On our last night on Sunday valet wait was over 30 minutes and that was in 107 degree heat. 
Their nightclub Hakkasan should be shut down by the Health Department and fire department immediately. It is a cancer on the mgm brand.

There is no longer anything grand about this property. They run a bare-bones staff and the staff that are there are no longer engaged in customer service.  

We hit the buffet a couple of times but it was overpriced for what you get. They had three aisles of food and every aisle had  identical items. Powdered eggs and bacon in pools of grease. 

Typically in most casinos you can float through the gaming area and hear screams of joy with multiple jackpots being won at different slot machines. Over the 4 days and 3 nights that we were there we never saw one person hit anything big. Not once.

We had 4 rooms here for our friend's birthday for 3 nights and we all noticed the little things that MGM lacked that other hotels had.

1. There is 1 ice machine per floor. Seeing as there is 150+ rooms per floor, it was not surprising that the machine could not keep up. When we called down to the front desk to let them know, they initially argued that a tech would look into the issue. After some time, they finally agreed to send up a ""complimentary"" bucket of ice. Glad that staying in a suite, they could shell out for ice for us! The bucket arrived one hour later.

2. One of the worst sportsbook\/cashier setups I have experienced. We bet on March Madness and when we tried to cash in our tickets after dinner, the sportsbook was closing so they said to check in with cashier. When we got there, they said we couldn't cash in our tickets until 1130. Seeing as how we were going to bet the tables we didn't mind at the time. When we came back at midnight, they said come back at 130. We came back then and they said come back at 330. Finally at 330 they admitted that their ONE machine to cash in sports bets was not working. Really ONE machine for a casino this big? Almost makes me wonder if they purposely try to discourage you from cashing in bets.

3. We got a suite so we would have a place to watch the March Madness games. Unfortunately the cable constantly cut out (at least 6 times during Kansas\/Michigan game).

4. Shower drains at extremely slow rate so plan on standing in your dirty water throughout your shower.

5. When using the iron on the first night, it spewed brown water all over my shirt. Not sure if it was from previous starch or just old water but was nice to start the trip with a stained shirt.

6. There are no lights besides 4 lamps in the 2 bedroom suite. They had a weird spotlight in the corner that was more for show than anything but you really were walking around in the dark, well unless you opened your shades and wanted to get blinded by green lights on outside of hotel.

7.  The suite is pretty nice but lacks certain features that other hotels has. We were looking for the mini fridge to put some stuff in and found out that it's a $35 charger per night to have a fridge.

8. There advertising is deceiving. Yes, every casino now charges you resort fees without any choice, but it's annoying that they say you have free Wi-Fi when you are paying an extra $30\/day in resort fees to cover that. And don't even think about using the business center unless you want to take out a loan.

We've been coming to Vegas annually for past 10 years and stayed at a number of casinos including Treasure Island, Mirage, NY NY, and Aria.

The hotel itself you can get lost in. We had meetings here which were completely on the otherside which made a great workout. Speaking of workout, the gym was tiny. For the amount of rooms this place has I have a better home gym. Some advantages are that this place has a McDonald's, Nathan's, several bars lounges and a very large casino floor.

Arrived Friday night to a huge line and less than half of the kiosks with an employee to check you in. On a Friday night? EDC weekend? We weren't the only patrons to feel irritated.

The front desk clerk was nice, and offered us a room upgrade for $10 a night, after seeing the photos, we agreed. Oh & don't forget about the $33 extra dollars a night, resort fee after the immense bill you've already paid for your room.

We finally get to our room, and I had to call the front desk to make sure we weren't given the original smaller room we had booked first, because the room was TINY, no couch like the pictures, and I would hate to see what a smaller room looks like. While I must say, the room decor and bathroom were superb, the room itself was not. The bed was comfy, the pillows were awful.
The joke of the century is the fact that you don't have a coffee maker, microwave or anything - but oh wait, you do have a fridge that can only be opened by code for $25 a day!?!!! What the hell is that. Why not just make it empty, and charge the fee if you want mini bar service? Went downstairs to buy 2 medium water bottles and a small Sprite - $15+?!?!?!!? Are you kidding? 
The maid came only one of the 3 days, had to call twice for someone just to bring towels!!

The buffet - you always hear about the Las Vegas buffets, and i remember them growing up. The buffet at the MGM is a single step up from hometown buffet, it was awful. 

Now the kicker - our first technical day in Vegas, we bought tickets to see Calvin Harris at the hotel night club, and tickets to a pool party with Tiesto the DJ. 
One drink each later, five hours of missing memory, and my boyfriend in the hospital, our items missing, and two drugged drinks. Yes, the stories you hear in movies about Vegas - can happen. & while I do not blame the MGM themselves for this travesty, because it was neither there fault, nor ours - it was a horrendous experience. We apologize from the bottom of our hearts for the scene we caused on whatever was slipped in to our drinks, and for however inappropriate we treated the security staff. We are hardworking young parents, and feel violated for not having control of our actions.
we never got our money back for the show at the nightclub, we lost our belongings, our memories, and our money.

The staff at the concierge and front desk were courteous and helpful. Our room wasn't available until 3pm and we checked in at 9am, but they were kind enough to stash our luggage until our room was ready. Smelled like perfume trying to cover up smoke, but what do you expect from a casino in Vegas. 

Spent that time getting to know the hotel and casino. As with pretty much any of the large casino's, be sure you have good walking shoes. It seemed to go on for miles. There was enough in terms of food and entertainment that you wouldn't have to leave the hotel if you opted. 

Did alot of gambling on the poker machines located at each bar stool, mainly because I could drag out $20 for a few hours on .25 bets and get comp beers. As far as the rest of the casino, it had pretty much every kind of slot and table you could ask for. There were a few trendy clubs there too, but not my thing so couldn't tell you what they were like. Also skipped the buffet. 

Just got a regular room, but it was plenty nice and the bed was very comfy. We were on the 26th floor overlooking mostly the airport, but you could see Tropicana, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandilay Bay. I would've preferred to be on the other side of the hotel to get a view of the other side of the strip at night. 

One of the better points was a lion habitat. They had one male and two females that were on display for most of the day. 

Quite a walk to the other side of the strip or Fremont St., but buy an all day ticket on the Deuce bus that runs up and down the strip and at least you can sit in some air conditioning getting to your destination.

The lobby area is huge, spacious, and has nice decor. In fact, you can practically get lost. The staff was kind and courteous. Housekeeping was so prompt and always available daily ... a bit too available. Sometimes they just knock once, and as I go to open the door, they already let themselves in ... which I'm not a big fan of. Next, the rooms were not as spacious as I expected, just average. It's a bit small, and plain. However, some perks are ... the pool is gorgeous, and is an also great place to relax. You get a 15% discount to shows and spa services. And the shuttle ($6 per person) is located right outside of the hotel, and can take you straight to the McCarren International Airport.

Boyfriend and I had planned a trip to Vegas since we turned 21 earlier this year; We never got the chance until the middle of winter Dec. 14-17th. 

MGM had a deal going on and we decided to take advantage. When we arrived, Ryan somehow worked his charm and got us bumped up into the 13th floor of the West Wing with Strip views; Really nice.

--Two TV's, one embedded in the mirror in the bathroom area

Now...this place kinda sucks even for someone who doesn't pay for the room.
For my visit last month....
I always confirm my reso over the phone and basically the front desk had no information about my arrival until I was transferred to VIP services.
The desk girl was so stupid and made the process 1000 times worse than it should have been.
VIP service was emaculate. No problems there...hence VIP.

So we get there and the bell desk fails to bring our bags for hours.
Then I find out they sent it to the wrong room! 
Next time, bring all bags in myself. 
I never self park at MGM b\/c of their stupid parking lot.

We get a non smoking room, but guess what?
Everyone is smoking on this No smoking floor.
In the hallways and in front of the elevators.
Obviously the management here doesn't care...staff passes by the smokers and don't say a peep or report it.
Let's just say MGM guests are below class...and they can't read or interpret the NO smoking signage?

Room service...terrible.
The person comes and goes with a tude...really? Guess you're not working for tips today.

Check out..a pain..the tv just spazzed out and I wasn't able to really confirm checkout.
Had to go do it physically...aiya and even that was a pain.

Many people there were commenting that this was busier than usual.  I am assuming because it was Cinco de Mayo. The concierge desk is professional and outgoing.  Never a dull moment in the casino, at the food court or even on our way up to the room in the elevator!

The reason for four stars instead of five... room 8-419.  I called it ""the room that was bangin'.""  You get my drift.  It was funny at first but they were just loud and we even saw people roll their eyes.  Also, across the hallway, some guys decided it would be a great idea to smoke many bowls each night because all of the fumes went into the hall.

Regardless of those two things, it was a great time.  We were across the hallway from the other people in our group which was super convenient.  Checking out was simple: You had your option of TV, internet or phone (via text message).

I'm adding my Centrifuge review here because they weren't listed on Yelp yet. I LOVE it here. Good hip hop, good drinks. It's located across from Studio 54 which is not one of my favorites but when you're drunk and not ready to go to bed F it! Studio 54 was open until 8am that night. Since Centrifuge closed at 4am  we went in and kept the party going.  What sucks about Centrifuge were the bathrooms that are a huge walk away so for those that were really under the influence had a long stumble to go through.

The room had adequate space and a clean well maintained bathroom.  When I go to vegas I find myself out of my room 90% of the time so room size is generally not a concern of mine.

The gaming downstairs is solid (had a negative experience at another hotel, so the MGM staff working at craps and blackjack were great).
Stayed until Sunday, and really appreciated every aspect of the hotel.

Coming from the airport, the taxi ride was about 10 bucks because it's at the beginning of the strip. We checked in close to noon and we were charged a 25 dollar fee for early check in. I didn't care, because I had waited in line to check in for about half an hour.  The lobby was nice and the check in went smooth. 

The room was located on the 14th floor but not part of the ""well being"" rooms. We had to walk down this long hallway that looked Newly renovated. We knew we were getting close to our room once the carpet changed to the old dingy carpet. We had a king bed. We only had two pillows on the bed. This was upsetting because I sleep with two. There was no fitted sheet on our bed, just a flat sheet to cover the mattress. This was terrible. The sheet kept slipping down the bed revealing the bare mattress. Gross. Our room just looked super outdated with stains in the carpet and wallpaper was coming off the wall. There was a huge footprint on the back of the door. There was no mini fridge either. 

Overall, the location was my favorite thing about staying here. There are better rooms than the one I stayed in. Next time I go back to Vegas, I'll be staying somewhere else because of the amount of money I paid; I expected to get a better room. They offered to upgrade my room to two queen beds, for a 35 dollar fee per night.

First off, I love the rest of the MGM - the restaurants, the gambling, the bars, even the pool. But the room we had was not up to my standards. The walls are so thin you can hear everything your neighbors are doing. EVERYTHING. The minibar was not stocked so now I'm worried that I'm going to be charged for the missing items.  The bed is comfortable enough but the bathrooms are starting to look dated. 

I guess it was Spring Break or something but there were constantly kids just partying and smoking pot at all hours in the hallways. There were fall-down drunk chicks everywhere. One was so drunk she crashed into me at the pool and her friends had to get her a wheelchair since she could no longer walk. Another time there was a girl throwing up by the elevators. Security should have a better handle on this.

As aforementioned, I love the restaurants here - We ate at L'Atelier, Taps, Emeril's and Shibuya. Except for Taps, they were excellent.  

So I guess the bottom-line is this: I'll continue to frequent MGM for the restaurants and gambling, but for the price of our room, I think we'll be sleeping elsewhere.",7,1,2

We got an upgrade with $20 more a day to the Tower Suites. I would say it's not worth it. 
The room we got was very spacious, the bed was comfortable but other than that it's very basic. I've stayed in hotels all around the world. They didn't even have a shower cap provided in the room, nor a care kit provided with the amount of money we paid.

The first time I stayed July 2010....I had a pleasant experience and this past time in May 2011 it was okay. 

Things I like about the hotel:
The Casino is good

Went to a really great comedy show there that was reasonably priced. 

LOVE the pool.... so many options and the lazy river is fun!!

Beds are comfy, and rooms are a good size.

Also the price is reasonable and they have fairly good deals.

Do NOT like:

Asked to extend our time and the kicked us right out because they had an event 

Most of the rooms smell like smoke even if they are non smoking. 

Restaurants are not great.

Out dated TV's

And the showers are for people under 5'4""....so uncomfortable.

To start with, we know it's Vegas and we tend to focus less on the little things and more on the general stay as a whole.  That said, this is not going to go down as one of our favorite hotels by any means.  

To start with, the hotel is so massive that they really need to refine their signage.  There is far too much looping around only to end up where you started and that is purely due to very poor directional signage.  It's not going to be perfect but it's not effective at all and you get led astray easily.  This is coming from a person who has stayed in almost every major hotel in Las Vegas.

As far as the rooms are concerned, when we arrived, I always check to see if there are things missing from the mini-bar or fridge that we are going to get dinged for and sure enough, there was a missing Smart Water and a back of M&M's that the housekeeping team missed re-stocking.  I mean, how hard is it not to see a tall Smart Water that isn't there when you are prepping a room for a new guest?  

The hot water is terrible here.  It's the worst I have seen in Vegas.  At two separate times(Saturday at 6pm and Sunday at 1pm) there was no hot water for at least 15 minutes.  That's just ridiculous and inexcusable. 

The beds were fine and the room stayed dark which is always a plus in this town if you are a late riser.  When we checked out, of course there are two charges for....drum roll please:  Smart Water and M&M;s.  They took them off but it's just an annoyance that was caused by an employee who doesn't know how to do their job. 

Those were the main points that made the stay underwhelming.",4,0,0

I stayed in the grand tower this week and a FIRE started in my room from an electrical outlet! Apparently there was a water leak upstairs in the unit above me. Around 2p on Friday we noticed that we had no water. We were never notified of a water shut off until WE called the front desk to ask what was going on. They said ""oh yeah, we have an emergency water shut off"". I would think it'd be courteous of them to call our room and let us know that we wouldn't have water for and even then offer some sort of monetary refund. However, that didn't happen. Then, after the water returned and my partner and I were getting dressed for a show at Planet Hollywood, all of a sudden, we hear a loud buzzing-bang and I look into the bathroom and saw there there was a FIRE coming from the wall where the outlet was! No joking! About a foot of flames. I had my partner leave the room and I quickly called the front desk, told them, and then hung up and left.

When I got to the front desk demanding an explanation the manager, Justin, offered to comp one night and move us into a suite. I'm sorry but this was 1 hour before our show we were going to, affecting our schedules, and did I mention A FIRE STARTED IN OUR ROOM! So no, I don't want a night comp'ed I would like a full refund!

We settled on two nights refunded and moved into a suite. Then at check out there were still fee's associated to the two night due to be refunded on our bill in which that check-out women then went to her manager to have removed.

Still not seeing ANY charges on my bank statement I called MGM about 5 hours later and asked why I hadn't seen anything. They informed me that it was going to take a few days. 

However, it's not all showing and they are cheating us for the first nights stay, and parking fee's. I'm sorry but when a fire happens in someone's room and they are 5 inch's away from it, YOU COMP THE ENTIRE STAY!

MGM I hope you see this because we will NEVER be returning to your hotel and this entire episode will be shared with friends, family, and social media.

However, it is quickly losing it's luster to all the other more glittery, themed casinos that keep popping up. I had lunch at the rainforest cafe and it was pretty standard burgers an salads type deal (not unlike ordering from Applebees or Ruby Tuesdays). There's lots of little shops and inside the main lobby there is a large habitat with white tigers. You may think this is cool, I firmly do not. i am staunchly afraid of large, carnivorous animals that have the ability to ingest me. Obviously i was a gazelle or zebra in a past life because the mere sight of them sent me running to the other side of the room. **(UPDATE: One of those scary bastards just attacked someone in spring of 2010 at the MGM. Who's silly for thinking them frightening instead of cool now? That's right.)***

The saving grace, as far as I am concerned, is Studio 54 where there are the sky dancers who hang from the ceiling and dancers who perform on lighted pedestals. Every time I have gone to Vegas I have stopped there because it is such a good time and that's me talking, not the six vodka and cranberries I had.

My friend and I met someone for dinner so I did get to sneak a peek at the rooms, nothing special really, exactly like a Comfort Inn. Also, I was informed by the occupant that because of the outside lighting (take a look at any picture of this casino) the room permanently glows ooze green at all times, it looked like someone needed to call Ghostbusters.

One thing I will say is don't drink the water...it's gross, but I think that's just a Vegas thing overall. It tastes like chlorine. Stick to bottled agua if you can!

The casino was pretty typical. I won $32 on the slop machines, but people sweat this casino has bad luck.

First off, if you're an MMA or boxing fan (btw, SCREW MAYWEATHER), you'll know this is the only casino that has the dedicated fighting ring.  So if you expect to see fights, it's going to be at MGM.

Second, they have several decent places to eat from the cheap (McDonalds) to the pricy (Emerill).  

Third, I just had to see the pool at Mandalay Bay to be sure, but I definitely ended up enjoying the design and overall environment at MGM Grand's pool.  I love their lazy pool and how they're just several pools to choose from when you just can't stand to be around certain crowds.

Fourth, the room and the beds are very comfortable.  Probably the only beds more comfortable are at Caesar's Palace\/Hotel Nobu.

Fifth, they have impeccable front desk service. I always got to check out late at no charge and when the shower didn't do hot water, not only did they fix it within an hour, they waived my entire stay's resort fee.  It was totally unnecessary, but totally appreciated!

Sixth, they have a rail that can take you to other casinos at not only a much cheaper rate than a taxi, but without the traffic.

Lastly, for those that love to party, Wet Republic is among the best pool parties and Hakka-San is among the best (and largest) nightclubs.  If you end up going to both, you might as well stay at the same hotel, right?  Both clubs have been good to me in more ways than one.

The overall hotel rates is in the middle of all the strip hotels.  It's not quite expensive like the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio, but not lower end like Harrah's or Flamingo's.

Perhaps my only complaint is unless you get the SkyLoft, you're not going to get a good view.  I got a good view from Mandalay Bay, but honestly, I didn't think it was worth it.

1. Craft Steak - restaurant owned by Tom Coliccio from Top Chef. 
2. Ka- Cirque du Soleil show
3. The lions who were energetic and lively in comparison to the sleepy lions at the Zoo who just lay around all day. 

My family and I stayed here (VIP style) for free thanks to my dad's vendor. We had the suite, which was OKAY. I expected a little more, since it was a suite; but it was definitely not as nice as the suites in the Hotel at Mandalay Bay. 

Room service was okay and the food was blah. We ordered the gourmet cheese platter which was $30 for crackers, 6 diff cheeses, and nuts. Totally not worth it. The buffalo wings were whatever- seemed like it was the frozen kind, but not the good ones that they sell at Costco. 

Anyways, I ended up winning $50 at the Wheel of Fortune slot machines so that improved my experienced with MGM. 

MGM would not be my 1st choice to stay, mainly because of the location ( I like to be in the middle of the strip) but Id like to come back and visit the other restaurants in this hotel.",0,0,1

I was excited to try it & assumed the pretty penny that it cost would be returned to me in at least a mostly enjoyable experience. I was wrong.

The Good: 
1. We chose to pay the $30 for the express check-in feature because Friday check-in lines are ridiculous & painful. We were helped after just a few moments. 
2. The young woman who checked us in was delightful. When I asked about upgrading to a two queen room she took care of it for us without hesitation. 
3. Our room was modern & clean, albeit small (We were in a Grand Queen Room). 
4. The Lazy River was the best part of the vacation, while it lasted. We had fun, the water was heated to the perfect temp for an overcast day, & the bartenders at the Casting Call bar were friendly. We were asked to exit the water after about an hour for ""cleaning"" which cut the fun short & we ended up just heading back to our room because it was too cloudy to hang out outside the water. This threw a wrench in the most enjoyable part of the stay. 

The Bad: 
Where do I start? 
1. The cords, from what I can only guess was a window cleaner, banging against our window first thing in the morning on a Saturday? That was horrible & lasted nearly two hours. News Flash MGM Grand, people stay up late in Vegas, the last thing they want is to be woken up by cords bouncing against their window & making a racket early in the morning. 
2. After being awoken so early I went down to the Starbucks to pick up some coffee. Bad idea, there were at least 75 people in line. Insanity. I gave up & headed back to Corner Cakes since their line was smaller. After being told they do not accept the coupon that was in my room I paid $31 for 4 donuts (not cronuts, just 4 regular donuts), 2 drip coffees, a milk & an orange juice. 
3. On my way up from Corner Cakes I find the elevator bay full & see that one of the lifts is stopped halfway between floors, full of people, & employees on the ground asking them to remain calm. That inspires confidence right? I head up on the next working one only to find, with everyone else stuffed into it, about half way, all of the buttons were suddenly unlit & now we're going down.
4. There was also Rainforest Cafe, where after waiting forever to be seated, we were told by our server he would be ""right with us"" only to wait over an additional 10 minutes to have our drink order taken. Then only 3 of our 4 meals came out together. I was left waiting 5 extra minutes for mine. The choice was for everyone else at the table to allow their food to get cold waiting for mine, or be half finished when mine arrived. Not a mention the server spilled root beer on my husband when refilling a cup. Totally worth the $120 we paid for the meal. 
5. The buffet. Wow. My husband went to use the restroom right after we were seated to wash his hands, & was directed out of the buffet, by a buffet employee, to a men's room on the casino floor. Upon his return the other employees at the front of the buffet weren't going to allow him back in, after we had JUST paid, & gave him a very bad attitude about the situation. Luckily the gentleman who had directed him out to the restroom to begin with noticed & came over to clear it up so he could eat the meal he paid for. I almost wish he hadn't. We both ended up with immediate stomach issues from the buffet & I ended up with terrible stomach cramps, vomiting, a headache...full blown food poisoning for days afterward. 
6. Then there was the issue of the sink & the toilet in the room. After running the water in the sink for more than a few seconds a sewer smell emanated out of the drain & then it would make a gurgling sound. That made me gag when brushing my teeth. The toilet had a sewer like smell whenever it was flushed as well.
7. It didn't help that our  itemized receipt would not load on the TV check out (2nd page had a failed to load error repeatedly) so I had to stop at the desk to get a print out before leaving to assure our charges were accurate (they were). 
8. Another concern was the Valet. When walking through the East Valet on our 2nd day we found the Valets driving the cars through the lot so fast & dangerously that they literally would honk the horn the entire time they were driving them from the drop until the cars were parked. After getting back into our vehicle at the end of our trip we found anything & everything we had left, from water bottles in cup holders to plugs or snacks in pouches or on the seats strewn throughout the car, having been thrown around by their careless driving. Everything was a mess. 

If just one, or maybe even two, of the problems had occurred I might have overlooked it, but this was just too much in 2 days. We are thoroughly disappointed. I wouldn't recommend the MGM Grand at this point. For the cost you can get better, or for the same experience you can pay less. It entirely ruined our weekend. We came home upset instead of rested.",5,3,0

If you have never been to Vegas google Vegas promotion codes as there can be some awesome deals available.  Our promotion included all day access to the buffet everyday, 2 cocktails at the pool, 2 passes to Studio 54 or Tabu and 25% off spa services.

Check-In- Counter was busy but wait was only about 5-10 minutes.  Our room type was not available with a King so we had to settle for 2 queens with the promise of switching the following day to a King with a strip view. We checked in and arrived at our room to find the door slightly open and not cleaned.  We went back down and was switched to a second room and upon arrival found the door slightly open but clean this time. We were uncomfortable with accepting this room so went back down to check in and asked for a third room.  We were helped by Joey and she was able to get us a $60 dining credit for our troubles.  After this little problem everything went smoothly and we switched to a KIng Room with a view as promised the next day.

Room- As people have stated the decor and the TV is a little dated but how often are you in your room or watching TV, it's Vegas people.  Room was very spacious, comfortable bed, large closet, nice marble bathroom with double vanity and plenty of space.  Plumbing was a little slow but not a huge deal.

Casino-Massive is an understatement.  I think it is the largest gaming floor in the world.  Can't really comment on the gambling here as we are thrifty and chose to gamble at places with cheaper table minimums such as Bill's Gamblin Hall (they have 99 cent margaritas at the bar), Imperial Palace, Casino Royale and O'Sheas.  All of these places are not as fancy but you can find $5 roulette all day and even on weekends.

Food-Buffet was fine especially since it was free but if you had to pay it is not worth it.  Best buffets are at Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Paris and Mirage.  Most restaurants here are very expensive.  We ate at Diego and Studio Cafe which are 2 of the cheaper sit down restaurants.  Both were pretty good.  There is also a small food court with a McDonald's, Nathan's and a pizza place on the way to the pool area.

Pool Area-  Awesome just like everyone says.  4 pools and a lazy river.  We stayed at the lazy river everyday as there is more shade and it's a lot of fun to just hop in the river and float around whenever you need to cool off.  There is quite a few kids with floats at the river everyday but there is plenty of room for everyone.  If you want good chairs get there by 11 on weekdays and 10 on Saturday as it is a lot busier on the weekend.  There is also seperate pool area called Wet Republic that is pretty much just for partying and functions like a nightclub with a cover charge and over priced drinks.  We did not go here as the lines can be enormous especially around the weekend and there is no shade and you have to pay for loungers.  If you are bringing kids I must warn that we saw 2 women with thongs at the lazy river on Saturday.

Entertainment- We saw Ka and it was good but we like ""O"" better on our last visit to Vegas. Also saw Crazy Horse Paris, it was okay. See Jubilee instead.  Best show we saw was Terry Fator at the Mirage, he is hilarious.  Keep in mind that you get discounts on shows at MGM if you are a guest.  We did use free passes to Studio 54 and it's best days are behind it.  If you want to go to clubs I recommend Tryst or XS or even LAX if you are okay with being shoulder to shoulder throughout the entire club.

Overall- Enjoyed our stay very much and the price was right for those on a budget.  If money were not an issue I would stay at the Venetian, Wynn or Encore as they appear to be immaculate.",0,0,0

Its also amazingly clean and very well lit.  I booked this hotel months ago for EDC week and after reading many reviews I was a bit skeptical. After staying for EDC week I'd have to say that it exceeds expectations. One downfall was the check-in process took what seemed like forever... Maybe it was edc week and everyone tried to check in at the same time. So I knew that there would be a wait regardless. Once I got to the counter the gentleman helping me was amazing. He was extremely nice and very resourceful. He made the check-in process a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes. We stayed in the Grand Tower Kings on the 21st floor. Which on the map looked far away but the elevator was literally right by check in. Our room was huge. Amazingly clean. A very modern look to the room. I also love that the window blinds actually block out the sun. From looking of the the window we had a clear view of the grand canyon I believe. As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas the last thing you want to happen was to wake up at 6am with the sun when you went to bed at 4am. I was able to call down to the front desk to get clean towels within minutes. Highspeed Wifi was a great plus I had very spotty phone reception and was able to make calls right through the Wifi connection without being dropped. Room Service? The menu is superb. Depends on the wait sometimes less than 20 mins and sometimes in the early morning (3am) the wait is a bit longer. For that weekend I believe it was 2 hours or so.There also is a food court area and a plethera of restaurants pretty much to cater to any kind of cuisine that you fancy  I love that there were two Starbucks located in MGM and one was just literally a few steps away once you go down to the main lobby.  As many as there is restaurants MGM has tons of things too do from WetRepublic, Hakkasan, TopGolf and their lazy river, you'll never be bored or out of things to do. I didnt have a cnance to experience these during my stay but conversations made with other hotel stayers in the elevators mentioned that MGM's pools are the best on the strip. As for late checkout that was a breeze. I was able to call the front desk the day beforehand and ask if it was available and it was so I was able to check out at 3pm! Checking out was probably the best part you can checkout from your phone your tv or waiting simply at the desk. I chose the option to checkout on the TV and was emailed a receipt of all that was charged straight to my email. This was my first stay at MGM Grand and from the Staff and the experience I had it definitely wont be my last.",1,0,1

There was the big fight with Pacquia and Marques and you would think it would be crazy and out of control, but it was actually not bad.  After the fight, people left quickly and in control.  I didn't see any fights, which I expected.  A lot of celebrities were walking through and nothing got out of hand.  

The rooms were clean and had the softest beds ever.  I swear, it was like sleeping on a cloud.  The only weird thing was that we were on the 13th floor and usually, there isn't one in a hotel.  Unlucky 13 turned out to be our lucky number.  Won on the tables, won on machines, saw celebrities, had a great time.

The tables in the day are around $10 and slowly move up as the day goes on.  Around 2pm, it goes to around $15-25 and around 5pm most table minimums are at least $25.

We get to our room (which is a HIKE from the main casino floor) and it was nice enough, until we discovered around 1 AM that the roman shades are broken, and considering our room faced the strip and that GIGANTIC video board at the Aria it was about as bright as mid-day in the room. After two different folks came up to our room to check the shade they finally decided to just break the pulley system so that the shades would stay down and said they would come back in the morning to replace them, but that never happened. At random times throughout our stay we would get an overwhelming stench of sewage coming from the restroom, and whenever we used the shower it would leak all over the floor.
