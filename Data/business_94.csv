The service.... Awkward. I liked that we had little sides waiting at the table for us. We arrived party of two and had to wait ten minutes for our table, even though was a lot of empty tables, but there must be a shift change or something or section rules, I don't know. Lots of employees though. 


The dining was nice. Except when you ask for extra settings for my friends arriving. It's all good, we just got up and walked to a neatly set table and grabbed the extra settings so they can eat. The dining was good. The food was equal to the price. 

Except when it comes to splitting checks. They can only split the check three times. We spent more time waiting for the check than eating. We got up and just paid up in front no problem. The lady who takes the money usually walks to each table with an armful of electronics. She looked like she was going into an intergalactic battle. 

Food was great, service was awkward with how to pay.",1,1,1

The service was what I had issues with. We went on a Saturday night around 8, and the hostess told us the wait is about 1.5 hours. I said that's fine and wanted to put my name down. The she proceeded to ""warn"" me that their last call is at 11pm and if we are not seated by then, we can't order and that's completely my responsibility. I was very confused and said ""... but that's 3 hours from now and you quoted me 1.5 hours for the wait..."" She was like ""I know, but I just need to let you know that."" I'm sure there's another more inviting way to tell me the same information.

Our wait ended up being ~45 min to an hour. I'm not sure if the food is worth that long of a wait (while I am fine with waiting for 2+ hours for KHDB) and the interaction with the hostess was definitely a big turn off. Probably won't be back anytime soon.",0,0,0

The very last time I was here I was so disappointed with the service. First our server was a female and she was nice and after our first order she told us she's clocking out and that we are going to have a new server (she mentioned his name but I couldnt remember because this guy never introduced himself nor tried to serve us) and then I noticed this server that's serving the table next to us, which by the way had the same female server that finished her shift, so I assumed that this guy is our server too. But we kinda waited and he never approached us and he kept serving the other table asking them if they need something else, so my bf called him and asked we could have some more of the sauce (or dip) the server is polite and all, but he never came back with the sauce, and he brought more food to the next table, so we called him again to order more food and to ask for that sauce again, and he did come back with everything we asked for, but after that he never approached us again, he kept passing by and serving the other table but never once asked us if we need something else, when we needed a new grilling pan we had to call him again just so we would get help, and this is how it was the whole time, never once did he try to actually serve us, at this point I was so mad I was close to going to the front desk to ask who really is our server, although I know it's gotta be this guy orelse someone else would have already approached us. We still tipped accordingly out of respect but honestly I didn't wanna go back here after that night.. I don't know.. Maybe I will get a better service next time.. But im still very disappointed.",0,0,0

There seems to be varying levels of experience in the waitstaff. I started by ordering some hot tea, and the server tells me they don't have it so I pointed it out on the menu. He says again that they don't have it which I took to mean that they ran out?? I then asked if the green tea is sweetened and he says a little bit but they can always make it sweeter. I said I actually don't want sweetened tea so I ordered an unsweetened ice tea and he proceeds to ask if I want sugar packets. I got the sense he's new to waiting tables and doesn't know how to veer off from script.

He then comes back 5 minutes later and apologizes for forgetting to start up our grill. He walks away and we had to flag him down to take our order. That was the last we saw of him. After that we were waited on by a girl who seemed more comfortable at interacting with people. 

I noticed the table next to us was asked whether they wanted their grill changed out while they were still cooking their food. Uh, where are they supposed to put the raw meats in the meantime? We weren't asked whether we wanted our grill changed until we were ready for our check. I think management should work on establishing more consistency.

We quite enjoyed our meal until it came time to pay. I think this restaurant is trying too hard to be hip. Instead of having your server take your payment or going to the front of the restaurant to pay, you have to wait for the designated person to come to you with a handheld card reader. Our server apologized for the wait and said there would be no wait if we paid cash. Doesn't the restaurant realize people don't carry cash anymore? And don't they realize they are a full-service restaurant and not a little food truck or cafe? There were so many irritated people waiting to pay it was unbelievable. 

Please invest in a regular cash register. I understand it takes away the coolness factor, but it'll make your customers so much happier. Here's a tip to fellow diners, ask to pay your bill 30 minutes before you're ready to leave.",2,0,0
26056,pzpH5qk-GAOGwxzyYMMpVw,pDplkJbShOXPhAChKVRMzQ,eLFfWcdb7VkqNyTONksHiQ,5,2017-03-26,"* Let me first say something, I've tried other kbbq restaurants, but this is, by-far, my favorite lbbq of them all. They give so many sides that the table is basically full and I LOVE the sides. This is probably my 3rd time eating there and it ceases to disappointment. 

* Once you walk into Gen, you get a feel of the aesthetic look of the restaurant. It looks like it would be one of those super expensive restaurants you'd find at the strip, but let me tell you something, the price is great! For all-you-can-eat, it's $16 for lunch and $20.99 for dinner. It sets a great romantic mood because of the darkness and pastel lights. It's usually busy there but it's really nothing to be worried about. The wait to be seated was very short; sometimes there's no wait at all. Although, on the days it's really busy, it's kind of hard to get the waiters attention so you could order more. 

* For the sides, they give clear noodles, kimchi, spicy pickled cucumbers, rice cakes, peas, salad, and others (I'm not sure what they are tbh). They all taste amazing and I could basically just eat them and get full. But anyways. We (2 of us) lasted for about 4 rounds of orders. Our favorite orders would probably be the Gen Chadol (beef brisket), Gen Beef Bulgolgi (marinated beef), and Chicken Bulgolgi (marinated chicken). Of course we've tried a bunch others and they're just as amazing. They're all flavorful and not bland like other meats in some kbbq's. 

* Would I go there again? YES!!! I have and will continue to do so. So far, it still marks as the best kbbq for me. 

* Rate 10\/10

Because they just opened, expect a very long wait, regardless of your party size. A table for two at 8pm on a Friday took 1.5 hours to get seated. Fortunately, they have a very innovative check-in system where they take your phone number and text you when you are almost ready to be seated, so you can walk around the connecting mall to kill time. They even have an app so you can monitor your place in line. 

Dinner - $19.95\/person - 32 items + about a dozen more items from the appetizer menu! Very good price (considering a lot of KBBQ AYCE joints are over $20), wide selection, and qualify food. I especially loved that the jap chae (glass noodle) is included because most places account it as a separate item outside of their AYCE menu. 

Service is in progress. Our guy forgot simple needs like white rice and waters after being prompted twice, and I was sooo thirsty in between eating all the salty dishes. But I won't ding them on that because he seemed new, and I applaud him for keeping his composure amidst a very busy night! Things should pick up after some months.

Gen is definitely my go-to for KBBQ in Las Vegas!",6,2,3

Ridiculous amount of time, but we were set on Gen BBQ, so we decided to wait. And although it was closer to 2 hours before we were sat, our server Samuel and the delicious food made the wait well worth it.
Let's just start off with a big ollll' round of applause to Samuel. We were probably one of the most obnoxious crowd, with hungry and needy people,  but he was able to not only accommodate every single one of our requests, but also had such a good attitude and everyone brought out our food so quick. He even sang happy birthday to my brother with everyone! :)
So now the food. Over 30 different, all delicious, selections for only 20 dollars. Whaaaaaat. Our party was put on two tables. Our table had 7 people. We ordered 18 briskets, 2 pork bellies, 11 beef tongues, 8 bulgogis, 2 orders roast beef, 1 calamari, and the list can go on. Every single dish was delicious and you bet we finished all of our orders.
The only reason for the 4 stars was because the hostesses quote inaccurate wait times, and a party of 13 can get super impatient, super quick. And also, the tapas were very minimal..
I've never had gen bbq in california, but I've heard everyone rave about it so I didn't really know what to expect. But they are by far the best kbbq in town, even if it is a good 30 minute drive, it is all worth it!! Samuels the best!! :)",1,1,1

Meat: They have a lot of different beef cuts and pork! LIKE A LOT PLUS SEAFOOD. Some of their items include: brisket, beef tongue, different types of marinated premium beef and pork, pork loin, shrimp, chicken, beef chunk flap, calamari, pork belly, and prime steak (top sirloin). My favorites are the beef brisket, beef tongue (trust me, it may seem weird but the texture is just a little chewier and doesn't get dry even if you accidentally over cook it), and prime steak. All my meats were juicy red and never frozen (places like Tofu Hut will give you the beef tongue with icicles on there).

Banchan: DISAPPOINTING. It really sucks here and they only have 4 items; cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi, a mashed potato-like item, and daikon. They don't have any of the  traditional items like soybean sprouts or pan-fried breaded fish. I guess their appetizers make up for it... They have a handful of items like spicy rice cake, jap chae, garlic chicken, edamame, etc. (No more seaweed salad starting July 2016). I recommend ordering rice paper, it's an off menu item and goes great with your meat (think of it as the tortilla to your beef\/pork). 

Service: It depends. Sometimes their service can be amazing, even on a busy day, but generally they seem understaffed and take forever to get food out. 

Overall: I am satisfied and can't complain because they do offer a lot. Lunch is $14.95 a person, and dinner is $19.95 (which is cheaper than a lot of places like Hwaro for example). I wish the maroon ice creams were included but they aren't sadly. It's $3.95 each (mango, strawberry, vanilla, and green tea).",8,4,6

There will probably almost always be a wait time, but the great thing this place offers is that they'll send you a text when your table is ready. I found it pretty convenient since you can kill time in the mall while you wait.

This place is HUGE! The biggest Korean barbecue place I've been to, which can also be why service wasn't up to par. We were seated at the high tables - something I've never experienced before. I'm not sure if they're still working out kinks with their burners, but our burner went out at least 4-5 times. It wouldn't be much of a problem if service wasn't so slow. 

Now their appetizer menu is pretty darn impressive compared to other places. They also have a unique menu for their meats. I wasn't impressed too much by the quality though. It lacked finesse and that special ""oomph"" that sets it apart. I personally found the environment and decor more satisfying to my eyes than the food to my stomach.

I know I'm late on my review, but whatevs. The beef tongue is AMAZING. That's all I order here, tbh. Thank god they started serving rice paper and radish. I don't think they did when they first opened. Also, the KFC chicken is pretty good. I would've given a 3-4 star rating because our waiter was ehh the last time we went. I believe his name was Julian or something. He rarely stopped by our table so we can order more. I gave a 5 star for Alan. Even though he wasn't our waiter, he checked up on us and was very prompt with everything we ordered. Totally made up for the bad service we started out with.",1,1,1

We had a party of 12 on a Wednesday and were given an hour to an hour and a half wait which we begrudgingly accepted. Close to an hour and a half later, we went to check on the status of our table and were told we would have to wait even longer than our original wait time because there were no tables big enough for all of us and no two six-person booths across the aisle from each other. So, we opted to sit at two different six-person tables on either side of the restaurant. Horrible planning on the staff's part and that is why I had to dock two stars.

As for the food, it was delicious and an amazing experience to cook it at your own table. We tried the pork belly, ribeye, etc. Pretty much a wide range of the selection offered on the menu. I would definitely go back for the food. Overall, it was a good experience and our server was super nice, but the wait time and issue with the large party was frustrating.",0,0,1

It is conveniently located next to the Galleria Mall, which prior to that, I was just at because I picked up a gift card because of a special promotion. I asked the front desk if this could be used at Gen KBBQ and she said yes.

When I got to Gen, I wanted to make sure so I asked the hostess before signing in if we could use these Galleria gift cards but she wasn't entirely sure. I handed both cards to her and  she asked her fellow hostess whether or not they'd work. They both said yes.

The food is alright, typical kbbq. Honestly, it kind of sucks that the meat portions are so small so that we have to keep on ordering back and forth. I would say that Gen has more focus on it's appetizers, but that's my opinion. Our server was somewhat tentative, I never got a refill at all until the very end...

We changed our grill plenty of times like at least 5-6 because of how charred it'd get. It sucks that they don't provide oil on the grill anymore like they used to. 

When it was time to pay, I gave the same hostess that I had spoken to both the gift cards and she then told me that they actually don't accept them after running the cards and went to go speak to the manager about it.

Long story short, this review is more focused on the customer service. I ended up paying my debit card which I didn't mind but next time, don't provide me false information... especially if you had another hostess agree with you, when in fact, were both wrong.

Next time, if you don't know, ask the manager. I would've been more understanding.. but boy, was that a hassle. I'm not entirely sure if I'll come back.",0,0,0

1. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but they had one side of the restaurant empty... Maybe they were understaffed or the kitchen couldn't keep up.

My friends and I couldn't tell if the noodles were raw, and since everything else was, we grilled them. Our waiter could not stop laughing at and teasing us! It was hilarious, stupid and embarrassing but a great time! 
Any how-this place was awesome. My friends and I felt it was too cool for the Galleria Mall; it really seemed like a District or Town Square-y joint. Very atmospheric, modernized intimate dining on the second floor of the mall. We also had a 20 minute wait so we left and wandered the mall until they texted me they were ready, which was super convenient.
The whole experience from the moment we sat down to the time we finally left was awesome, super fun and just a great time. The meats were all delicious and it was really fun to cook and season your own food and sample the tables' creations.  
I think my favorite thing was the squid bulgogi. It was hilarious watching the little white blob curl and quiver on the grill and it tasted absolutely delicious. The jap chae, glass noodles and veggies, was also really yummy, double cooked or not. I wanted to order another serving just to double grill as a joke but my friends are better at being decent adults and convinced me not to. The other fav was the soju; we got pomegranate lychee (you can mix flavors) and it was so delicious that two of us downed a pitcher in about 30 minutes.

We did the AYCE dinner experience and honestly, it's a great price for what you're getting. The bar was set up so that there was a grill between two people and we were still able to talk and enjoy each other. The noise level was a little high, but nothing that dampened our experience. 

It's not even worth listing everything we tried because I'm pretty sure we tried about 60% of the menu. It was all very yummy and filling and I didn't think the meats were too salty or anything.

Yet as soon as you emerge through the front doors the fun environment, the colors of the lighting and the beats from the music just fill you up with this awesome vibe that is Gen. The decor of Gen is very modern yet has slight classy aesthetics of the Korean culture sprinkled through the layout. It's actually very eye catching once you come through the entrance. For the style alone I give Gen 5\/5 stars.

Let's get down to the main part of the review here. The food, the comfort,  and our help\/service.

Gen is all you can eat...and the pricing is actually very reasonable. $20 per person isn't bad at all! Especially if you have 34 choices of meats and items + any of the appetizers + all of the sides. All of that for just for $20! My wife and tried as much as we could. We started with appetizers: gyoza(fried), edamame, japchae, pickled veggies, potato salad, and a salad.
-Only gripe was the edamame which was a little over cooked but didn't stop me from enjoying them. Everything else was delicious! Now the main part....MEAT! So many wonderful choices! 
We ordered: Beef bugolgi, garlic chicken,garlic calamari,steak strips,pork cutlet,cajun shrimp, roast beef, bugogli chicken, and I know more just can't remember it all. Everything was freaking delicious! The portions were not too much nor too little. The plethora of flavors kept my dance buds dancing all night. Gens good easy get 4\/5 stars

All this yummy food was accompanied by the awesome booth seating we asked for. The booth was comfortable, soft and supportive. The tables had a nice feel to them, like a mixture of vinyl and marble. The table was large enough for our multiple plates, our drinks, the sides and our entrees; with plenty of elbow room to spare. Oh and I almost forgot the cooking pan sits dead center of the table! So all in all the comfort level was indeed a 5\/5 stars!

Now onto the icing on the cake , the service. Adolina was our main service of help for the night and she was awesome!  Really attentive and friendly. She made recommendations that were awesome! She always had our glasses full and prompt when making sure our cooking pan was replaced immediately when it started to have all the excess burnt food sizzling on it. It's easy to express that Adolina was just pure awesome sauce; friendly, fun, informative, and an all around suburb waitress. We will be back for her service and friendly smile along side the food!  Adolina services alone help give Gen a 5\/5 stars. 

So to sum it up for you yelp readers, Gen is fun, has great food, energetic atmosphere and has amazing service. Let Gen be your next Kbbq experience!",3,3,3

I've been to many Korean barbecue's in the past but nothing like Gen. It was alive- great music, a lot of people having a wonderful time with friends, and an attractive decor. 

All that aside the food was top notch. There wasn't one item of the 32 meat's provided that wasn't great. Granted, I didn't eat all 32 but gave it a good try!  With that said I will be back as many times it takes to give it all a sample. I know I won't be disappointed. 

Lastly, the service was over the top! Krinke was amazing! There wasn't a moment that my girlfriend and I went without. The food came at a perfect rate, the drinks never ran dry, and we felt like we were the only people in a nearly packed restaurant. 

Thank you Gen for giving Henderson one hell of a restaurant.. and thank you Krinke for being amazing!

Well done!",2,2,2

First at all, we didn't ask any discount. He is the one who offer 50% . And when the birthday boy got the check it's only shows 20%. I really wanna know how dare he lied to a birthday boy which is only 19 years old! This is not about training system , this is about their personality. Really disappointing of Gen group also really disappointing of UNLV. Cuz the person who lied is graduated from UNLV. Really wanna know with his personality how does UNLV let him graduated.
Second , I checked all the reviews. Pretty much there have a lot ppl had same experiences. Why Gen group they never improve ? Looks like they even don't care about what we wrote. I know Gen is only open a month . So what? If u guys not ready for open a business like this. Then finish the training . Don't open when you are not ready. 
Third, just wanna let everybody know I went to Gen in LA before. the service and food quality r better than Gen Las Vegas . Much better. At least Gen @ LA they didn't lied about discount.",6,5,0

Eugene made great menu recommendations (e.g. Beef tongue, Gen sauce, etc.). I have never been a fan of beef tounge in my life, but Gen's tongue is my new favorite on the menu. He also hooked me up with chili sauce and their special Gen sauce and i didn't even ask for it.

Not saying that this is the worst kbbq in Vegas, but it's close to there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money here, there are much better kbbqs in Vegas.

Ew moment of the week: Went to the toilet stall as a WORKER was coming out. Go in to find toilet seat down with pee drops all over it.... BRUHHH WTFFF?! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AND THEN PEE. As if that wasn't bad enough he didn't even flush!!!!! PLEASE MAN MERCY.

I've been here three times with friends and family that wanted to try it out. And each time I've went here the same problem was always there.

I find it off putting that their speech is always the same is ""3 card max. split, 4 meat per order, leftover will be charged"" I came here to eat ayce bbq and have a good time, not a speech of ""here is what you can't do"" in a semi threatening tone.

Servers here are 0\/5. They have a system where you don't have a dedicated server it's just a whole bunch of servers walking around. This creates the problem of zones specifically being left out. Many many times I saw tables next to me waiting forever to get an order in, when the other side of the room is swarming with severs dicking around. The servers seem to not have the intention of helping out too, they just walk around in circles and avoid areas waiting for their shift to be over. You really have to get their attention. Instead of them asking you if you need help with anything it's you that need to get their attention. It's very frustrating when you need a simple water refill or more potato salad.

Echoing off many of the reviews here. You can only place 4 orders of meat....imagine coming in with a group more than 5... So limited!!!!! The portions are teri-freaking-bad too. So tiny!!!!!!!!!!

Literally the only saving grace at the end was one server who kind of kept an eye out for us. Mizzo was his name! He made sure our orders we're coming through and apologized if it took a long time.

I like the side dishes and appetizers like the Korean fried chicken (KFC!) And the cheese stuffed pork.

Whenever restaurants from California and other places develop a location in Vegas, it is always nice to know that I don't have to travel too far to go to a place like Gen again. Even though Gen is 30 minutes away from where I live, I would be down to make a trip to Henderson just to get Korean BBQ!

Compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas, Gen Korean BBQ house has one of the best deals for AYCE! It is only $14.95 for lunch and $19.95 for dinner! Even though their AYCE cost is cheaper than other places, Gen's meat quality is excellent! From their beef brisket to their marinated pork belly, everything is very delicious at Gen. Gen is the only place I would enjoy eating pork belly because I believe that other Korean BBQ places cannot compete with the pork belly that Gen offers! In addition, Gen has A TON of choices for AYCE menu items that you can go from your basic brisket and bulgogi to delicious Korean fried chicken and japchae. Gen is also the only KBBQ place in Southern Nevada that has rice paper! I have been waiting for a KBBQ place to come that offers rice paper because eating KBBQ meat with rice paper is WAAAAY better than eating KBBQ meat with your typical bowl of rice.

Whether you have to make a 30+ minute trip to deep Henderson like me or even live close to this place, Gen Korean BBQ House is definitely worth going to!",4,5,6

They dipping sauce was lite and tasty and didn't overpower the Gyoza. Our 2nd appetizer was the Cheese Pork Cutlet that was very good it was crunchy on the outside while the pork was tender oozing with cheese, this also came with a dipping sauce and it was good but very strong. For our Entree we had Gen Chadol (Beef Brisket) it was so tender and cooked quickly they give you a dipping sauce and seasoning for your meats. We had Chicken Bulgogi and it was marinated in a sauce that had a little sweetness to it with no need to dip it in any sauce.

Me and my friends came here for Halloween for dinner. The hostess took down our name and we were immediately seated at our table not even 30 seconds later, so that was big plus. We ordered our food and immediately we got our food. Fast service is also a big plus. Here's where it went downhill.

1. I ordered Kalbi, one of the best Korean meats you can eat, and when it came out, it was only one slab of meat. All the other Korean restaurants I went to, I always got a plateful with stacks of Kalbi. But here, I only got...one. And it wasn't even good. So, portion wise, Gen should add way more meat.

2. This is just my two cents, but the menu needs work. This is a Korean restaurant and there were no Korean words in the menu. Only the English equivalents which made it confusing. 

3. The grill wasn't even hot. Even when I turned it way up it wasn't warm enough. 

4. This one really made me reel over. After dinner, I asked for the dessert menu: They said they don't serve dessert. Whhhaaaaaaaaat?! You can see my reaction. What kind of place has no dessert?! I understand it's a new joint and it just opened, but seriously? Not even Sikhye?? (traditional Korean beverage, Google it) 

5. The foods themselves were okay. The workers there were okay. 

***6. Oh, and make sure you remember this: if you want to split the bill, the maximum they can do is up to 3 people. So me and one other friend had to combine our bills. That was just frustrating. 

Overall, in Vegas there are way better choices for Korean food. I recommend Sura. At least there you can grab however much you want to eat. And they have dessert.",0,0,0

The lunch is $15 on weekdays and dinner (and weekends lunches) are $20. The premise is all you can eat (AYCE) meat, and most of the meat is decent quality. Some AYCE restaurants serve low quality meats so they can bring your a tremendous quantity, but Gen doesn't compromise quality. The beef brisket and tongue are very tender and juicy even if you have to cook it yourself and believe me, I've gotten way more plates of those order than I should. Their pork belly (samgyupsal) is worth trying although I'm only a moderate fan of that cut. Their soy sauce has a mild tart and sweet flavor which adds a unique flavor when you dip meat into it. You can ask for all sorts of side dishes included in the price such as japchae (glass noodles), calamari, tofu soup, etc.

I'm somewhat of a KBBQ veteran having eaten at many AYCE KBBQ places, and Gen is near the top in my overall list of KBBQ to visit again.

The parking is at the Galleria Mall. And if you have to wait for seating, which can happen during dinnertime, you can always wait while shopping at the mall.

The wait staff is very friendly and attentive even when business gets busy.

They have you pay your check on an iPad which can be unsual for some folks, but they make the process very easy and low-pressure as they look away when you select a tip amount in front of them.",2,2,2

Gen Korean BBQ is basically the same everywhere... from Honolulu to Cerritos, and Rowland Heights... the service is cheerful and helpful!  The menu and rules are similar - two hour time limit; order four meats at a time; and finish the meats or get charged for the leftovers.  

The main difference here was the free and plentiful parking at the Galleria Mall in Henderson; there was no wait; and there was no loud music!  My cousins, mom, auntie, sister, and I were able to have great conversation while we cooked our own food!  We had a great time catching up and talking about all of the dishes!  

They enjoyed the Marinated Beef (with the slice of pineapple on the top) the best. It was tender, flavorful and quick to cook.  The banchan, rice, and sauces complimented our meats well.  We got refills easily!  The boy cousins got the Spicy Baby octopus and Cajun shrimp - they ate everything!  We got two of the three extra items that are served at dinner only - tongue and the previously named Hawaiian Steak (yangyum galbisal).  Delicious!

I guess a party of 3 wasn't large enough for a 4 seater booth... whomp!  The menu blew my mind!! I've never seen so much selection! My mouth couldn't stop drooling! My GF was overwhelmed with all the selection that lead to instantly selecting all the basics.... I wanted to explore but I also didn't want to be stuck eating everything! There is also a fun selection of appetizers. The quality in the meats I've tried are great and well portioned. Note- if you order the short ribs be prepared to tell them how many. The appetizer pictures can be a bit deceiving but it was still delicious. I can go on about details on each bite but I wont! I'll let you taste it for yourselves.

** after speaking to the manager, the server was much more attentive. When I payed the bill the hostess was very unapologetic , and actually pretty rude. I would of thought the manager would of offered some kind of compensation after our inconvenience, but I had to pay the whole bill of $147.51 (which included 18% gratuity for their bad service), probably not going to come back anytime soon **",4,0,0

Everything is seasoned well and the glass noodles, while they look like worms, are delightfully savory and delish. The service is hit and miss. When they first opened, I had exceptional service twice, since then, not so much. 
A few weekends ago I took my brother and his GF here for lunch, Sunday is dinner prices all day. No problem there, it's still a good deal with the amount of meat you can order. However, it was hot. Like the temperature inside the building was so hot. It was a hot day and I was hoping the restaurant would be cool, but nope. And we didn't get prompt water refills. We had to ask multiple times for dishes and grill changes. 
I can forgive all things except the lack of water refills. If you can't quite get the place cooled off, I get it. If you are short on clean grills, I get it. But, leave a carafe of water for the table if you are prone to forgetting. Leave more than one carafe if it's hot as balls and your table keeps asking for water. We are dying, mister!
I will be back again though. The food is too good to hold the heat against them for long. I'm hoping they get the air conditioning sorted out and that they can get the staff up to its former glory. If they can do that, it would be 5 stars. Yeah. Meat. It's good.",2,2,2

I was genuinely dissapoointed with my experience here. If you are looking for traditional KBBQ restaurant, this is not your place. 

The food was a huge dissapointment. The marinades lacked traditional flavor and meats did not seem to be of good quality. The combinations of side dishes were weak to say the least, as we were only given 5. They were even out of half of the sides of we asked for, unfortunately. 

I understand wanting to cut down on wasteful eaters, but portions were miniature compared to traditional KBBQ places (example: they served my party of 4, 4 slices of galbi per each order... SLICES).

Coming from Southern California, i grew up spoiled with cheap but great quality all you can eat Korean bbq. For the past 8 years, I've been looking for a similar experience here on Vegas. Well, Gen Korean BBQ is definitely the place. First of all, the price of 19.99 for dinner is a steal for the quality of food. They have a wide range of meat\/chicken\/seafood selection. The brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly are all on point. The different seasonings for their pork belly were all excellent. Their side dishes and appetizers were all really good as well. My fiancé and friend especially loved the rice cake. The salad is good, and they have rice paper!! That was a huge selling point for me. I got to have rice paper with my Korean BBQ. Bean paste was also great.

The service their was excellent. We were told the wait was 30-45 minutes, and was seated at about 41 minutes into our wait. Side dishes were already waiting for us when we sat down. We got our orders taken within 5 minutes, and even before we were finishing our first order, they were already bringing out our meat! Throughout our dining experience, the servers were quick to refill our drinks, take our orders, and brought our food within 2 minutes of ordering. We asked for a ton of rice paper and salad, and each time they were quick and accommodating. I cannot rave anymore about the great service we got.

I do wish there was a location closer to the southwest area, as the drive out to Henderson took about 30 minutes. But it is completely worth it. The wait looks like can be pretty long, as we did hear some people being quoted up to 90 minute wait time for seating. But in my opinion, if you can make the drive and wait, then you will be rewarded!

We live close and I have read on Yelp and Eater.Vegas that this place was good so we decided to check it out. We were greeted immediately and our name taken. The wait was about ten minutes maybe less. This place was very busy and as we ate it got much busier. This was a Wednesday night. We were first seated with another two gentleman, but I felt like I was intruding in their loud conversation. Since it was our first time I requested to move to a more private table. I am not always crazy about places that you cook your own food, but i was wiling to give it a go. Drink orders were taken right away. (you know me) (bonus). Not much beer on tap but that is not a deal breaker. Appetizer Popcorn shrimp and Calamari. Both good tatsting, the dipping sauce was real enjoyable having a bite needed to offset the plane-Jane shrimp. Red wine Pork Belly, Thin sliced Ribeye, And Garlic Chicken. There was not a lot of instruction from our waiter on how to use the grill in our table so the meat stuck and ripped when we put it on the hot surface. The Ribeye was good but needed some pre seasoning. Pork Belly was full of great taste marinated well. Chicken was bland but thee was a sauce that was given to dip it in. We finished our meal off with Ice Cream Maccaroons, Strawberry and Mango. Both had good smooth creamy taste and a good way to finish off a meal. 

Thank you for dining at Gen Korean BBQ. Overall a great experience, staff was friendly and accommodating. Could have used better instruction on the Grill. Drinks were refilled without asking.

My husand recently came back from a year tour in korea and we were craving kbbq. So we decided to try here. Well for starters, when we walked in we were greeted warmly by the beautiful decor and friendly host staff. We were seating in booths that are quite comfortable. Service was amazing, we had the pleasure of having Ozzy who was supper efficient in eveything from water refills to explanation and recommendations to stuff in the menu! They even have appetizers included In the AYCE. Our meats were brought out quickly and they were delish. I will say the lack of bachan (side dishes) were very scarce and in the korean tradition (I'm half korean born and raised in korea) those are important. Non the less the appetizers did a good job in replacement of missing banchan. My son was enjoying his pork cutlet and even had 2 orders! I was too busy enjoying the food I forgot to take more pictures. Overall great environment, cost, taste, food and service!

Went here around 7PM, & wasnt surprised to know that there would be at least an hour wait. It's dinner time at an AYCE location, no biggie. Once we were notified that a table was ready two dishes, a salad & noodle, were brought out as appetizers as well as 6 little sides arranged by the grill. 

We ordered brisket, pork belly & premium steak to grill. We also ordered this panko breaded chicken & cheese with a dark sauce... I want to say it's similar to katsu, even the sauce. Also KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) that came with a creamy sesame? sauce, both were pretty good! Rice all around & of course we had to get more of the noodles.

Our server was a little busy & had to come back to the table multiple times when he could have made it with one trip.. but it was just simple things like refilling drinks or getting sauce. And at the end there was a mix-up with checks from our table & another table getting the wrong change. Because of those things, I gave 4 stars.

Maybe coming back at a less busy time (whenever that may be for dinner) it'll be a more seamless experience with the service. But the quality of the meats were great, & the food that is already prepared is hot & delicious! Can't want to go back!",2,2,2

I've heard mixed reviews from friends that have tried this place so I decided to check this out with some friends that are Asian. I have been to many Korean BBQ including the ones in Korea. 

This place would NOT be on my list to go. The atmosphere is not what I expected. The waiter we had was not friendly. They squished seven adults in a small booth with not enough table space for food to grill and eating. We basically cooked our food ourselves. The condiments were mediocre. No service. Maybe because some of us were Asian? I don't know.

The price is cheap, but so was the quality of the meat. I definitely had better. Overall, the whole experience was not that good. I was hoping I would like something to come back. I think for people who may not have experienced the whole Korean BBQ thinks this is great, but not for me. I will go elsewhere. Too bad, we need a great place in Henderson.

We literally ordered everything off of the menu that was available for lunch, which only excluded beef tongue and maybe one or two other items. Lunch also includes all you can eat appetizers for $15.99 per person!

Let me begin by saying that the table booths are a little cramped for 6 adults but we managed to sit elbow to elbow without too much of an issue. Once seated, we took inventory of the small bowls of sample-sized extras that surrounded the in-table circular grill and quickly received our drinks without hardly any wait time. (THANK YOU OZZY!!) Ozzy gave great explanations of everything on the menu and was attentive to some dietary needs we had, while maintaining a sincere smile and positive attitude. This means a lot in today's food service industry.

Our only problem presented itself when the food started arriving. The grill, extra sides, drinks and our place settings left hardly any room on the table for our food! It was like playing Jenga with dishes of meat and vegetables. It was then that Ozzy informed us that we could place items on the high shelf close to the wall if we were out of room. There is a pretty good amount of room up on that shelf, but it is awkward because it sits pretty far above your head and you have to stand up to see what you have placed on it. Without that shelf, there is no way we would have been able to fit all of the plates in our eating space.

We were SO pleased with the quality of the beef, chicken, pork and seafood that came out of the kitchen. The brisket was beautifully marbled, bright red, sliced super thin and absolutely melted in my mouth. The seafood was not slimy at all, which gives me confidence in rating the freshness of their ingredients. We went through maybe 8 plates of the brisket, 4 plates of calamari, 3 orders of KFC (yummy!), 4 plates of chicken, 2 plates of pork, 3 plates of shrimp and one plate of the volcano chicken along with lots of fresh veggies, pickled veggies and kimchi. You also get unlimited rice with your meal. Our favorite appetizer was definitely the fried rice sticks but the veggie dumplings are great, too! After a couple of pitchers of Sapporo and a TON of dirty plates, we finally hit our limit.

There are 3 minor complaints that I would give these guys -
1. The lack of larger tables for larger groups (just get 2 tables if you have a group larger than 4 to avoid our issue)
2. The restaurant itself is rather dark and people on one side of the table (away from the window light) had difficulty reading their menu. This is nothing a commercial lighting redo wouldn't address, however.
3. The wait staff is paid in a tip pool and are required to split their tips. Now this may seem fair from a customer perspective, but when you work as hard as Ozzy does side-by-side next to a low-energy, non-motivated waiter (who will remain unnamed), the problem becomes clear. Please, Gen, consider giving incentive and recognition to your hard-working wait staff on a regular basis! They SUPER deserve it!

I am giving Gen a 4\/5 because of the 3 issues above. The food quality is amazing and is absolutely deserving of 4 stars. I would also say that the grill doesn't really get hot enough to sear the fat on the thicker-cut pork belly the way I like it, but this may just be personal preference. Maybe cut the pork belly a little thinner to combat this. Clean plates, cups and silverware and the overall restaurant seemed well maintained. I cannot attest to the cleanliness of the restroom because I did not use it. I also did not partake in any of the drinks over at the small bar they have.

Highly recommended and I will most certainly be back, with friends!",3,3,3

Perhaps mopping isn't on their list of priorities.  Also, I did notice posted at the front by the hostess station that their rating by the Heath Department had been downgraded to a B but we decided to stick around and try it any way. Most of the meat is mediocre at best.  The only thing we would give a good rating is the smoked pork belly.  Additionally, the kitchen manager was unaccomodating.  We noticed there was a chicken dish with a cheese fondue.  We asked if we could have the cheese fondue with a different item but the manager said no.  Again later in our visit we requested only a half order of meat and were again told no that they we could only get a full order.

The selection of korean bbq restaurants in Las Vegas is mediocre at best. Hailing from sunny California, Gen decided to grace Sin City with its presence. I have dined there a few times and found it to be better than any other AYCE KBBQ spot in Las Vegas.

LOCATION\/AMBIENCE
Its main drawback is location, which is pretty much ACROSS TOWN from most people. However, I am willing to bet all the Henderson and east side folks are happy they no longer have to travel to Chinatown. 

The restaurant is HUGE and very modern. There is ample seating and weird glowy lights and random shows playing on the screen. Looks more like a lounge than a restaurant. Since the place is so large, we never have to wait very long to be seated (or am I just lucky?)

Since it's located at Galleria Mall, parking is easy and plentiful.

FOOD
The selection of meats is fairly standard so I won't go over every little thing. However, marinated thick cuts of pork belly, pork jowl, and large sections of tripe, which I all love, are quite rare in Las Vegas. For that I am thankful. The standouts are definitely the pork jowl, miso pork belly, and smoked garlic pork belly for me. I just love pork belly. 

Beef tongue is also good but beef brisket is sliced waaay too thin, causing it to just fall apart upon cooking. 

The appetizer and banchan selection is average. My favorites are the potato salad, salad, and thin radish for wrapping.

SERVICE
The other drawback of Gen is its service, which is extremely inconsistent. Some employees are obviously inexperienced or just not motivated to work quickly and efficiently. In addition, there seems to be no organization, as you will be asked the same question multiple times by different people but end up waiting 20 minutes for a plate of meat and somehow receive 2 items you did not even order.

VALUE
At 14.99 for weekday lunch and 19.99 for weekday dinner and all day weekend, Gen is very much worth the price. Just make sure you have ample time allotted to compensate for cooking, driving, and slow service. Overall meat quality is average but you get what you pay for!

Tips:
- Request for oil on the grill to prevent sticking (why don't they do this already?)
- You can request sesame oil and salt for dipping.

The quality was either terrible (Tofu Hut) or the price was just outrageous (Woonam Jung). But fear not, deer friends, Gen Korean Bbq house is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the situation, hopefully, in order to execute the awesomeness of the situation, and finding that shining light, that wherever it takes us, we will find a way to succeed. I don't know what that last sentence was, I was on a roll. And sometimes, it's just hard for me to stop. Like the copper top. Who likes to drop. Bippity bop.

Gen Korean comes by the way of California, a chain that has proven its popularity, particularly the Tustin location. This is also the only ayce kbbq in the Henderson area. I've heard the buzz and wanted to check out their stuff. I also heard it through the grapevine that they had something called 'rice paper'. I was like ""Rice paper?!?"". And then I left to try it out.

For some of you who have trouble finding it, Gen is located on a new part of the Galleria Mall that had been built out. For some reason, I thought it was near like the Sauce restaurant and stuff. But it wasn't, it was connected to the mall. So look at the mall, and you should be able to see it. There is a sign. A big one. A very big one.

Walking in, I liked the interior. It was modern, new, and fresh. But, it didn't feel too uptight or rigid. And you know I'm all about that. And then some. Picked out a boothy (boo), and started perusing the menu. One thing I noticed as I was about to order was that there were none of those huge air vents that are normally located above the grills on a kbbq table. Then I looked at the grill. Ermahgerd!
They have the side vents that are located right next to the grills to suck up all that smoke! The only other place I saw this at was at Gyu-Kaku, and I thought that this was the greatest thing in the world. Right there Gen (Bennifer), you've got a big fan right ova' heah!

Onto the food itself. There weren't a lot of misses, but of course there is on every menu, so I shall inform you. Popcorn skrimpy's. If you're expecting Taiwanese popcorn skrimps, you will be disappointed. These are more of the Chili's or Applebee varieties. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The other people I was with thought that all the other appetizers and sides were good though. And normally, my favorite thing to eat at a Kbbq is kalbi (marinated short ribs). I thought the ones here were OK. The meat quality is very good, but I felt as though the meat could have been marinated for a longer period of time. It tasted more like a steak. And steak is great. But kalbi... I need a bit more of that flava flav, catch my drift ;). And the skrimps (the ones you grill). I'll go on record by saying that I've never had good skrimps to grill on a kbbq in Vegas. That trend will most likely continue.

Everything else was rock solid. The banchan is really good here. All the other meats that I've tried were excellente. Keep an eye on that #9, that beef short plate. T-ara was right about that one (I applaud you if you got that). One of the best meats I've had at a kbbq in a looong time. Surprisingly, their bulgogi (thin marinated sirloin) is probably the best in Vegas. Haven't had a good one in a while, and this one was really good. Probably a close second to the short plate. All the meats here are amazing and the grill is heated perfectly to cook them all. 

The service was good here. I've read the reviews and it looked like it would have been inconsistent, but it seems that Gen is constantly working on it, and for myself, it was probably one of the better services that I had at any kbbq in town. My drinks were always filled, and so were the banchan. They were also taking our orders quickly after we had finished our meats, so I was impressed.

Gen is my go-to Kbbq in Vegas. This place has everything I'm looking for when I go out to one, and so far, stands head above the rest in town. Oh and Gen's famous rice paper. B to the omb.",23,17,21

The food is also fantastic although, the kimchi has had a funny taste to it. The beef bulgogi is very good and the meat seems to be marinated well. While the garlic calamari is good, it could have a bit more flavor. I also like that there are ready made options for picky eaters like my brother. They have chicken Katsu and fried calamari. Their japchae is pretty good as well. It's great for family and friend gatherings and there's plenty of room to accommodate a large family in a booth. If you request a certain game or channel to be put on the big screen, they will generally accommodate you. Lastly, I hate the tipping system! I requested that my tip go to a specific server and was told it couldn't be given that way because it's put into a pool. This makes no sense because my server may have worked hard to help my table but, the server serving the table next to me may not have been as helpful.

They crack jokes, get to know you, suggest different plates, they make you feel apart of the family. I've been to this location twice and both experiences were ridiculous. Tonight's experiences was definitely my last. 

First experience: 
- Host was rude. Didn't greet me. Looked at me and turned to the other host and continued to chit chat about weekend plans. 
- Waiter was MIA. The entire time. When he was there, he was so slow. I received more help from the busser than I did with him. Went back there to find him since the grill was so charred and I just saw him chatting with another waiter. Sweet. 

Second experience: 
- Host was rude, again. Same host from the first experience. No surprise there. But this time she was conversing with a guy. I assume he was a manager because he was wearing an Affliction shirt and not a black button up. Go figure. 
- Poor waiter, he was so busy with 5+ different tables with larger groups. Had to ask multiple different bussers for water, extra meat, napkins, etc. before I even received anything. Within 1 hour, I asked 3 bussers + my waiter for extra meat and only received assistance once with a partial order. 
- Bartender was standing behind the bar singing and laughing with absolutely no customers on that side of the restaurant. Might've been helpful to utilize her assisting customers rather than chatting and singing Adele at the top of her lungs. 
- The manager came over and I thought that he was coming to check in since I had continually asked the bussers and the waiter for multiple things. Nope. He came to pick up the dishes and ask for the menu. Didn't even get a ""hi, how are you?"" SMH. 

When will people understand that customers are what drive your business. Not having your staff mopping and cleaning 20 minutes prior to closing time. 

Here's some advice, save your money and go to Tofu Hut haha. They may not have the 90s playlist or flashing neon lights, but at least someone will greet you and serve you food. You can get Korean BBQ anywhere. But without a focus on driving your business and creating loyal customers, you'll never get anywhere. 

Gen isn't on the strip, so tourists aren't even easily accessible to them. We are locals and we are your target audience. A lesson in customer service and effective management would greatly benefit this location. Smh.",3,1,1

The meat is average quality and you're definitely getting the quality that matches the price. The portions are relatively small, but each person in your party receives up to 34 menu selections - including the sides. The steaks and galbi are pretty decent and probably the best value of the all you can eat menu. If you are a fan of Sundubu (spicy tofu stew) like they have in Korea, I don't recommend their side of it. It was pretty watery and not hot at all. My friend ordered the sesame chicken and it was overcooked, extremely dry, and lacking in sauce and flavor. The samgyupsal ( pork belly) selections were absolutely delicious, especially the pork belly marinated in red wine. I would also recommend the chabol (thinly sliced pieces of beef). Service was divided in quality in aspects of who was serving you. Individuals check in periodically to see what you'd like to order and also change out the stove (whenever you feel) to maximize the flavor of the meat. The menu was lacking in the side selections in comparison to other korean bbqs, such as steamed egg and bean paste stew. 

Overall, this place doesn't even come close to other Korean bbqs I have experienced. If you are in the mood to eat a ton of meat, want to ease into the korean bbq experience,  or looking for an easy place to fill yourself up, I recommend this place to satisfy those desires. You can't expect highly of all you can eat bbqs, but this one is pretty decent. It does beat the other restaurant selections in the galleria and is a nice place to stop after shopping and running errands. It really depends on what you're ordering, but personally I'd invest in a better quality bbq if it was a nice occasion.",0,0,0

There are a lot of options to choose from, but the flavors and food didn't feel like authentic Korean BBQ. I actually found the items that were pre-cooked (e.g. KFC) and the side items (salad, kimchi, and potato salad) to be better than the main dishes that you cook at the table. 

As for the cook-at-the-table items, the beef bulgogi didn't quite taste like bulgogi and was disappointing; however, the pork bulgogi was better marinated. The Gen Chadol was also disappointing and very bland. The best item was the garlic pork belly which was tastiest when you got it a little crispy like bacon. 

Overall, we left full but not quite satisfied with the meal. I think the menu is the same for dinner which raises the cost to $20.99 so I recommend trying it out for lunch first.",0,0,0

From the sleek decor, to the prompt and courteous service, Gen has the system down to a T. No angry Korean moms yanking the tongs out of your hands to correct your ""cooking style."" Don't get me wrong, I secretly love angry Korean moms, but they are not for everyone.

The meats are some of the most fresh I have ever had, and our server Lisa (along with like, five other servers) kept them coming at breakneck speed!

The buzz is hot right now, so expect at least a 45 min to an hour wait on Friday and Saturday. I'm sure some of the hype will die down eventually, and so will wait times. But even so, totally worth it. I live only 10 minuets from here, so I know I will be here often.

All the meats come out pretty quick, so you don't end up sitting there for ages before you get to eat. Like other Korean BBQ places, there are the side dishes, but the side dish selection isn't as large as other places. Side dishes aren't too important to me as the actual meat selection, so i'm not too broken up about it.

We had a 15 person party for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, and the only thing that's important when having a large party here is that they do not take reservations.

I went up again to ask the hostess if our table and she said yeah your table is being cleaned.

With several locations, well established in California (mainly so-cal), GEN brings the flavor to Southern Nevada in the city of Henderson (basically Las Vegas) but to be politically correct..it is in Henderson & situated in the Galleria Mall main entrance along side other restaurants.

I do compliment the fact that Gen provided an outdoor menu located by the entrance pathway for those not familiar with the delicacy or those just curious of what will be served...of course alongside prices.  This does give the opportunity for the customer, the option to decide whether or not they want to eat here without stepping inside, only to walk out in slight embarrassment...depending on one's personality.  (This could be a good thing or bad thing for GEN) I decide it is a good thing for me as a customer and to know what is expected.

Since the restaurant is located in a high traffic shopping mall, parking can be a hassle, especially at peak hours.  Wife and I arrived at an off time, around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Booths were in full use with a couple of hungry patrons before us waiting to be seated. We were given the option to be seated advanced with an open area at the high tables (somewhat like a bar area with high chairs) but we opted to wait an additional 30 minutes for a more comfortable and intimate booth. I do applaud the host for recognizing the option as others not willing to wait...would be able to jump on it.

Low & behold, our 30 minute wait turned into a quick 15 minutes as we noticed the patrons before us, being seated in timely fashion. 

***** Please note that peers and colleagues have noted that waiting time can be very long especially at peak hours...so we got lucky. 

Weekend price was fixed all day to a reasonable $19.99 considering it was a dinner price & everything on the menu was available. If you are looking for a cheaper price & time permits, definitely come in during the weekdays during lunch hours, but do caution limited menu items for ayce.

Ambience was very modern & contemporary...very different compared to the casual and Asian feel of the usual Korean BBQ places here in Vegas and Chinatown area anyways. It had a feel to somewhat being in a VIP night club to an expensive gourmet restaurant. Background music was mild in sound, but could have been drowned out caused by Noise level chatter. It was some what loud, but not as bad as a Chinese Dimsum restaurant I won't name since I am not reviewing it. 

Upon being seated, our hosts & servers were on point & seemed to check back frequent for more food order requests, taking empty dishes away & making sure our experience was on par. Menu choices were a-plenty in variety which I appreciated & even included appetizers to the ayce menu. Some of their portions per order were on the smaller side, but since it was ayce...it didn't matter, because you could request more & more until your heart desires...or until your stomach can FeastMode no more. 

I was disappointed in the brisket, being bland compared to other kbbq joints. Their dipping sauce was limited as well as the seasoning & oils. I cannot complain on that area though, because I did not ask to see if they had any hidden in the kitchen. 

Over all my experience was definitely on par & did fill me and my wifey's Tum~Tum to the brim. I do knock off one star as I have tried many kbbq joints...4 stars is being generous...as taste was mediocre and comparable but not better than cheaper china town locations. Again variety, service & ambience gave a very slight edge, but not by much. 

I think the real winners here are the Henderson locals who do not have to drive out to Chinatown to get their K-Fix. As for me living in Summerlin it is quite a drive, so I do not see myself coming back anytime soon, as other competition are much closer. This does not mean I won't come back. Vegas is small so even a drive out to Henderson isn't that bad compared to California standards. Am willing to give it another go if I am in the area or bringing others out to try it. 

I think Gen did a good job, & it's always nice to have another option to go to. It gets my approval and recommendations to try and check out...so if you are in the area...check it out too!",3,2,2

2nd when you get seated your side dishes are already set for you. Last night the salad and Japchae was already at the table. FOR ME THAT IS A NO, because it's not sanitary to me. I mean how long has that been sitting there? I'm fat, so I still eat the fish cake and kimchi.
3rd BATHROOM WASH TRASH! The floors were sticky and it was not properly clean. I understand they have the dinner rush, but please have someone delegated to clean the bathroom at least every hour to the hour.
4th service was great, Ozzy you were great! Always making sure we were good, and making sure we got our food right away. They even accommodated my weird request of just having a plate of lettuce no dressing .They were always asking to top off our drinks or to change our grill. 
5th the real review on the food: meat was really good, I don't think you can really go wrong with the meat at Gen. If it sounds good, 8 out of 10 times it will taste good. THAT BEEF BELLY THOUGH! THAT IS A FREAKING MUST TRY!!! Chicken and cheese sauce is good as well. Red wine pork belly is so sinful. Sesame chicken my favorite. Only complaint is that they NEVER have Squid Bulgogi.

When we , the four of us, got to the table,
Service was good. However, time went by, servers did not walk next to us intentionally.
I asked another server to get our server, he completely ignored us. We did not see our server for 30min. When he finally showed up, he looked upset and we felt very uncomfortable. Furthermore, they brought us the wrong order twice. 

I talked about this service with other people who visited separately.  We concluded that the restaurant tried to slow down our order. 

I am wring this review for other people not to come but to warn the owner or manager that if they keep doing business like this, they will eventually lose their loyal customers in the long term.

I've been to better ones near Chinatown where it's a tad bit pricier; however, quality was much better than GEN. GEN's looks may be nice but isn't really matched up for the type of restaurant they are hosting. 
1) GEN's interior design is sadly better than the food. The food is dry, not well marinated, oily in some cases, small portioned, and monotoned. 
2) There's no sprinklers in the ceilings so what happens if a Wanna-be-chef (like me) can't cook right and accidentally 'overcooks' their food and a catastrophe happened. Yes, I saw a fire extinguisher but it's far from being reached and being reasonably safe. 
3) The overhead hood that collects the smoke wasn't present and should be on top of the grill. While I was eating, I was inhaling smoke like crazy and got sicker and sicker the more I stayed. I know some veteran restaurants have vents above grills to collect the smoke and suck it up instead of spreading around the restaurant. 
4) Service was okay. Their communication was on point. Once me and my partner ordered more we got it in less than a minute because they use smart tablets to send it up to the kitchen. Now that's clever way of being precise and fast for the customers. 
5) So many grill changes and it was driving me crazy. Of course I'm cooking more food yet they have the audacity to ask me if I want a grill change. The other restaurant automatically does it for us because why would we cook our food on a burnt grill? Common sense. Yes it's nice to ask but do it in a way where you have to change it rather than wanting a customer to keep a burnt grill where the burner is still running. 

I would personally not be back here. They don't accept discover cards (sorry folks). They don't give you forks (unless they have some in stock- sorry for those who can't use chopsticks for their life (like me)). And the prices for drinks is higher than most restaurants and they do not have HOT WATER for hot tea. They only have soda and iced water. I can see potential in this restaurant but that's in the future. They're still in their opening phase and I can't blame them. But for the meantime, I'll keep this restaurant on my low priorty list.",14,11,11

Our AYCE meal included unlimited appetizers, meats, seafood and banchan (small side dishes).   We started off with a mundane and unnecessary order of gyoza. This was followed by orders of signature steak, Cajun shrimp and spicy chicken that we cooked on the grill.  The grill was replaced a few times and we ended up ordering just 2 more proteins, though I don't remember either.   The food was good, but there was a sameness to our second order since many of the proteins are marinated in the same ingredients. 

When I went to settle the bill, our waiter said he did not think our coupon would be accepted, but he would check with the manager.  Once he returned and told us it would not be accepted, I asked him to send the manager over who reiterated that only a hard copy of the coupon would be accepted and not one printed off the Zip Code Magazine website.  The obvious question that he could not explain was how does the consumer know that some coupons (originals from the magazine) would be accepted while those printed off the website would not?  He said he would confirm the policy with the main office, but I seriously doubt anyone was working at 8PM on a Monday night.

First off, we were seated immediately, despite calling ahead and being informed of a 30 minute wait. The side dishes and water were brought within minutes.

Our server, Alodia, was so attentive and understanding of our requests. We had a group of 6 and we really REALLY like the rice paper, she was so great for constantly bringing us the rice paper and sides we needed. In addition, all our meat orders arrived very swiftly. 

At one point we asked another server for Hawaiian Steak (which is what it is called at the Gen in my area, but apparently is not the name here) and he tried to guess what we wanted based on how we described it, but it ended up being a meat we didn't want, and Alodia was so understanding and took the incorrectly ordered meat away and explained that the one we wanted is actually called Galbi. 

All around spectacular service, this is absolutely our favorite location and best believe we will be making coming to this Gen a new tradition for our Vegas trips.

Food is okay, not terrible but not the greatest. 

I lived near ktown in Los Angeles and this would be a lower tier bbq joint.

However, adjusting for this area and it's competitors I think it's a good mid tier joint.

Reason for the two stars is that my girlfriend got food poisoning from here.

We woke up late that day, came here around 2pm for our first meal of the day. A few hours later she was vomiting on and off for the rest of the night.

The only things she had that I did not was the shrimp tempura and an iced green tea. My money being on the shrimp.

Customer service makes a huge difference when it comes to an overall customer experience. I came here with three friends and we instantly fell in love with the environment. It is so modern and the ambiance sets off a good vibe, we were given drinks and our sides, and asked our waitress a lot of questions since it was our first time. Rude off the bat - she was very impatient with us and in the middle of asking her questions she'd talk to the table near by to get their order. As shocked as we were we just proceeded to order with her once she finally came back. I'm a short ribs lover as well as the rest of my party so we put in 1 order not knowing it was going to be a slice on one plate, and our waitress knew because that's all we ordered so when she came back with the one slice of rib she put it on the table as if she knew 4 people could share that ONE SLICE! Ridiculous. We had to wave her down and order 16 orders of short ribs, she stops writing down our order, looks at us, and says ""16 short ribs?!"" YES GIRL, what else did we say? We killed that one slice of short rib in a second between us 4, we want more than ONE rib to eat LOL We waited for a long time and when she came to give us our short ribs, one slice was on one plate, aka, she brought out 16 plates of individual sliced short ribs to us, why not just put the 16 pieces on one big plate?! Anyways, her service was slow and rude, we always had to flag her down, we only refilled our waters ONCE because she never came to check on us or looked our way to grab her attention. Towards the end another server helped us because she explained that our previous server had to clock out, our previous server didn't even warn us of the server switch because if she notified us then we'd we looking out for the second server instead of waiting and looking out for her instead. Our second server appeared to have more tables to cover yet she was on top of her game to try and pick up what the first server has started with us, and I appreciated that! However, upon finishing up and paying I do not think what I paid was worth the experience, worth the long waits, or even with tolerating the rude server.",3,2,2

My friends who live in Vegas decided to take a few of us visiting from Oahu to this awesome restaurant. I saw one will be opening at Ala Moana Shopping Center within the next few months & I wanted to see what the hype was about.

Luckily for the 5 of us we only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night. For $20.99 you can choose from an abundant amount of meats, sides & seafood to fill you up. Each party is allowed 2 hours to chow down & drink up. The food came out really quickly so we didn't feel like we were wasting our 2 hours waiting for our food. Everything we ordered was delicious & I don't remember exactly what we ordered because I was just so hungry. Your set up comes with 4 sides to share (potato salad, kim chee, picked daikon & cucumber kim chee), salad, 2 sauces & rice. 

The staff were very attentive. They always checked on us if we wanted to order more food, have our waters filled or just see how we were enjoying everything. I liked how they asked us if we wanted to change our grill often because it kept everything neat & not burnt. 

The 5 of us got a pitcher of strawberry yogurt soju which was delicious. I think happy hour starts at 9 with a ton of drink specials.

Let me start by saying this is my absolute favorite KBBQ place in LA (born and raised there, and I was so excited about its LV arrival). I live on the south west side, and am rarely ever in Henderson. Let's face it, if you're gonna cross the 15, it's gonna be a whole day event!

We tried to go in after the UNLV\/UCLA game @ Sam Boyd, and figured we'd have plenty of time since they close at 12. We left the game at the start of the 4th quarter and got to the restaurant at 10:55pm, and figured we made it right on time. Unfortunately, the hostess informed us that they weren't taking any new tables. We asked them what time they close, and she said 12, but the kitchen closes at 11. We asked them, just for future reference, what time their last seating is, and she suggested we arrive at least by 10:30pm. 

If that's the case, then there needs to be some kind of warning or signage or something! Unless it is mentioned otherwise, a restaurant's last seating is typically when the restaurant closes. 

Definitely not sure if or when I'll be back because I have no idea when I'll be back in Henderson. I had such high hopes for this place and am really disappointed in my first visit there.

My friend was having her birthday so her and her kids jumped into my Dodge Ram limousine and headed south to Gen Korean BBQ, located in the Galleria Mall off Sunset. As we arrived, the combination of the weather along with the Great American Foodie Fest across the street made us think that grabbing a table would be no problem. How wrong we were. It was a 45 minute wait at 6:45pm. The restaurant was filled with groups and groups of asian people. There were asian people flowing out the door onto the sidewalk. All for $19.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ. I was both impressed and thinking this was going to be great.

A text message summoned us to a table set for 5, in a comfortable booth with a low set grilling device built in to the table. An appetizer of edaname, and seaweed salad accompanied the already served small dishes of various Korean appetizers like kim chi and others. A brief flurry of ordering steak, kalbi (not called that on the menu), pork bellies, roast beef, squid, baby octopus and others. They had some interesting variations on the pork belly like smoked garlic (ordered) and miso flavored. 

A tower of Widmer Hefeweizen and a few carafes of Soju got the party started. Lots of cooking and soon plates were filled with various meats. Unfortunately for me, none of it had any flavor, it was very bland and basic. A small dish with salt\/pepper mix and a few drips of a liquid flavor were also given to each diner, but this wasn't going to offset the bland flavors.

Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I would come back because the food was just blah. Service was hectic, but when you ordered it came out from the kitchen fast. The table was barely large enough to hold all the plates and drinks. There are other Korean BBQ places that place an emphasis on flavor. This place is popular because you can eat a lot of food for $20.",5,3,4

It was my choice to go and my Bday, but only saying that because I was in a good mood and chose the place.

They told us there was a 20 minute wait turned out to be more like 30 to 40 minutes and all the time l saw there were open tables just sitting there why are you going to make people wait when you have open tables I just don't get it. But things became a little more clear from the hostesses but they don't know what the hell they're doing, walking back and looking at the empty tables over and over again taking my phone number to text me when the seat is ready yet not even using them just calling out my name, and you have waiters thatthat literally said please give me the number instead of the name when ordering it's easier for me. Also it would be easier for you, is to not act like no one's ever asked for soy sauce or to ask us if we are finished over and over, but at least  bring the check at the end of the meal, we had to walk up to the counter because nobody came by for 10 mins?

The food quality and keep mine I have nothing to compare it to other than a one time Korean restaurant was OK then you have the short ribs off the bone and while there was a lot of options there wasn't a lot of blow you away quality when It came to the meats and very little flavor-marinade-sauces

There is definitely value in the $20 the all you can eat and maybe they're still going to improve the service which might put three-four star which in my mind means it is worthy of a least one more shot but I'm not in a rush to go back",1,0,0

Interior: Unlike most KBBQ place which has a pretty casual vibe inside, the inside of this place was so fancy! It was also really cool and not smoky like some kbbq places.

Grill: The ventilation of the grill is great! Usually when I am at kbbq, I have smoke blowing in my face at some point. Not here!

Selection: so many different selections for a great price! I love that they have various type of sea food instead of just one. Most places I have been to, have different menu set with increasing prices so I always feel like I am missing out by going cheap. Or if you go to a cheap kbbq place you get like five selections.

Side Dishes: I usually don't eat these and they didn't have a great selection (some places gives you ten different dishes). I did love the potato salad and the fact that they had pickled radishes. They ran out of rice paper when we went :(

Price: Reasonable lunch and dinner prices. I went for lunch and loved it. I would say lunch price is most worth it for me. 

Service: Really nice service! Water refills! They changed out grill so often and was always asking if we need something. Paying was super easy because they brought the electronic payment system over so we can pay. We didn't have to wait for the check or anything.",4,4,4

Lunch prices are a little cheaper so we make it a point to go around 11am-3pm ($16); dinner is ($21). 

Order the KFC Appetizer, Jap Chae glass noodles, and gyoza to start. I normally order two or more orders of the KFC because it's just that delicious! We've recently switched from white rice to rice paper which helps us save some room for more meats. You should try it! 

Red wine pork belly, Gen signature steak, spicy pork bulgogi, and lots and lot and lots of Gen Chadol which is the brisket. We order all those over and over again till we're full! 

They also come with sides that are already available at the table upon sitting down. I usually only eat the fish cake, sweet potato and kimchie. The rest I kinda just push aside. They're kind enough to get me some more of my favorite sides if they see you run out. 

You can also ask them to change your grill when you feel like it's a little gross from all the cooking. They'll gladly do it for you. This place always has a good amount of staff working and will always have people constantly checking on you throughout your meal. 

Aura of the place is nice. My BF especially likes the old school songs they play in the background. 

Will always be back!",10,5,9

I came up to Vegas for my friends birthday and of course we wanted to do ALL YOU CAN EAT. BBQ is also her favorite so it was perfect.

It was basically ~$20 and you get to order as much as you want. Just make sure that you eat everything because they will charge you if you have too much left over stuff.  I really love the khalbi and the Teri beef...  all their little sides are also really good. I always have to order more of them. 

I think the best way to do these kinda all you can eat is to do family style and just share everything so that you get to eat a little bit of everything. Everything comes out relatively fast because you grill it yourself.  

On a side note, our waiter was really cute and I thought the food runners were also easy on the eyes  so that's just a bonus!",3,1,4

Other than what I had already mentioned, there was an incident during our dining experience where I accidentally spilled water. If I had not waived down a server\/bus person endlessly, they were not going to do anything about the spill on the table even though they were walking by our table multiple times ignoring the situation. They didn't even offer a new glass of water when everything was half-ass cleaned. Only the floor was wiped but not the table. The food that had water in them was not replaced or taken away. I know it was my fault to spill the water but accidents do happen and I was once a server so I know what level of service is to be expected when drinks are spilled as it happens more often than not.

I can only see this place getting 4 stars because people that are giving high ratings are not used to going to real korean bbq places so Gen blows their clueless minds.",4,4,2

The restaurant is large, tons of seating, and clean. The grills suck the smoke through the sides, so you don't get so much in your clothes. 

Another plus for me is their appetizers. I love the deep fried squid legs and the KFC (Korean fried chicken). The place gets really busy, so don't be afraid to place a large order at the start, since more than likely you'll only get checked on a few times. If I go in a group of 5, I'll start out with an order of 5 or 6 of everything (brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, etc.), then add on more later as needed. In terms of dessert, they offer those macaron ice cream sandwiches.

A late lunch last Friday was a great time to try the place out. We got there around 3 and it was pretty empty - it is a big place to be honest.

After asking us if we'd eaten there before, our drink orders were taken and we were brought the sides typical of kbbq. The salad dressing, a nice vinaigrette with a hint of Asian flavor, was just phenomenal to me, I ate about two plates just to myself.

We started with steamed edamame and sesame chicken. I had to ask about three times to finally get the edamame. Luckily I had my salad.

The first meats we ordered were the signature steak, beef tongue, spicy chicken (one friend loves spicy) and small intestine (one other friend loves that). I didn't get any of the steak, but it looked great and my friends said it was awesome. I'll definitely make sure I get some next time I'm here for dinner. The beef tongue was good here, not too chewy.

Next we got the chicken bulgogi, pork belly, and the brisket, a go-to meat that never disappoints. Both types of chicken here aren't the easiest to cook if you don't use the scissor provided to cut them up first; some pieces are pretty big and won't cook through quickly and there was a decent bit of fat on some of our bulgogi. I don't care for pork belly, the but the two big slices looked really nice and my friend said they were quite good. The brisket, given to us in GIANT slices, was really delicious. The marbling was great and there weren't like huge parts that were just fat which I liked.

I think my favorite thing about the meats here were the portions - sometimes at kbbq, the plates of raw meat are so big that its hard to be able to try a variety before getting too full, but Gen's plates were nice and small, allowing us to try more things and never get stuck with too much to eat in order to leave no waste.

Before I was done, I wanted another small bowl of edamame. Again, I had to ask three times. The second time I asked if it was on the way, I considered saying nevermind, and I wish I had - this bowl was overcooked and pretty much every piece was soggy, mushy, and full of regret and sadness.

Besides the edamame being forgotten both times, the service was great. Every server was polite and I never felt like I was being annoying asking about the edamame. The food was really delicious. I can't wait to try this place again, either this one when I'm in town for another weekend or a so cal location the next time I'm in LA.",3,2,2

the quality of the food was really good. i loved the sides they gave, the potato salad, kim chee, onion etc..sooo good. we ordered alot of the kal bi, premium steak, squid legs, miso pork belly, and shrimp to name a few. we had so much food. there were 6 of us at the table.

one thing i would say that was a bad thing about this place is at one point, we were slowing down a bit but we were still eating and drinking. then someone from the staff comes over to our table and asks if we could move to another table because there was a big party coming in and they were waiting for the table we were on. although we had a 2hour limit, we were there for only almost an hour at that time. my aunty then told them that we were still eating and we werent done. i could understand if we were just drinking and talking stories with each other, then yes, we could move to another table because we werent using the burners. but we were. anyway, the staff was a little rude at first, but they realized we were still eating and they apologized and moved the big party to another table.

We came here to celebrate our anniversary and while the ambience was great, they really need to work on customer service. The night started out great, but 20 minutes into our dinner, our waitress disappeared. She never came back to tell us she left for the night and that another person was going to wait her tables. This particular waiter was nice, but not very attentive. Our food came out really slow at this point, and then they forgot one order and got another one wrong.

Terrible.

We've been to a handful of other AYCE Korean BBQ places, and while the food here wasn't bad, it wasn't the greatest either. The portions were smaller and the appetizers not very appetizing. May be if the waiters were more attentive at helping customers, I would have had a better experience.

In fact, there were more workers cleaning tables and changing grills than there were employees waiting tables.

I sure as hell ain't hard to please. Great customer service goes a long way for me and I was sorely disappointed with the service and the night overall. My wife wasn't as critical of this place as I am, but she also wasn't happy.",2,1,3

Their meat was A1. Even the location was hard to find  on Google maps. The service and quality of food surpassed all my expectations. next time we visit Vegas we will definitely come again.,0,0,0

And it was a Monday around 7:30pm! Food is on point, didn't care too much for the flavored sojus. We tried the lychee flavor and it tasted more like the lychee juice from the cans. Tried a lot of the meats on the menu and I especially liked the cow tongue. It wasn't too gamey like most places and the pork belly was super good.

I was a bit disappointed by the food. My sister commented that the meats tasted rather Americanized and I'm inclined to agree. I always get favorites like beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi at other Korean restaurants but when we got the food, it just didn't taste right. It tasted overly sweet and the charcoal flavor wasn't really there. The Korean fried chicken ended up being like this weird sesame chicken.

However, surprise hits were the beef brisket and the beef tongue. Both meats were sliced very thin and cooked really fast. The flavors here were nice, and we kept on ordering multiple orders of beef brisket.

The mashed potatoes were really good. The potatoes were slightly sweet (probably due to apple) and had some corn. We had multiple orders of this dish.

The grill we had was really weird. Despite using a lot of oil, the grills kept sticking. Maybe the heat was on too high? Maybe the grills were bad? Combination of both? We had to get the grill changed out like five times.

Also initially the service was really strange. Our server seemed disinterested and almost hesitant on getting us orders of food. Later on she lightened up and was more friendly about it, but the relationship started out strangely.

Anyway, this place is okay, a lot of the meats tasted funny, but there were some good hits.",3,1,1

This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being ""chain restaurant"" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.

I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).

This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...

Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because ""sticky"" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.

Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.

They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.

I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows: 

#3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the ""beefiest"" flavor.

#5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.

#7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.

#8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...

#10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.

#15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.

#17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.

#20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.

The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.

Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.

Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony.",14,5,10

Came in around lunch time since I was in the area and it was busy so we waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The whole restaurant was pretty dark and playing loud music.

We got seated at one of the high bar tables, in which there was barely any room to put our plates. There was only 4 dishes of banchan, which is really small compared to other kbbq places. They didn't even taste good, nor were they ever offered to be refilled once the plate was empty.

Our waiter came immediately to take our drink order and then our food order. He disappeared after that and we never saw him again. We had to ask the busser in order to get more food. Our water was never refilled and we had to ask 4 times.

Whoever gave our food to us didn't seem to want to be there. She just mumbled the name of the meat, slammed it on the table and walked off. This happened every time, it made me not even want to order anymore. It also took a while for our dirty dishes to be taken away. I asked for an extra bowl of rice, waited a bit and it never came - so I asked another girl. Waited again and it never came. I asked one more person and it finally came after 20 minutes.

I'm going to make this short and simple. The brisket is the business. Bulgogi could be a hit or miss depending if you like it more sweet or not. The Cajun shrimp was a miss for me, as it was lacking in flavor. The spicy chicken, it is delicious especially since I love spicy food. The marinated beef steak is delicious, has a nice garlic kick to it. For appetizers I liked the popcorn shrimp, the Gyoza was very lackluster. Overall the dinner was awesome!

Came here with a friend on a decently busy Wednesday night and was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. Typically kbbq places are pretty plain with poor ventilation and leaves one suffocating in smoke, and clothes soaked in kbbq sweat; however, gen knows this and did a great job at it. 

Service: Friendly greeting by the hostess, attentive staff, and overall a pretty pleasant experience with the employees. Meat came out quicker than expected.

Apps: I wanted to save my room for the meat and only got the K.F.C. which are boneless yangyum style chicken thats marinated in a more tangy\/sweet than spicy sauce. Like a much crispier orange chicken that was very good

Meat: We got the sirloin, brisket, tongue, pork belly, pork belly garilc, and galbi. All of which was pretty disappointing. The brisket lacked a good amount of fat that resulted in dry meat within 20 seconds of grilling, the galbi's marinade was a bit weak and didn't have the sweet goodness i'm used to enjoying. The pork belly garlic was very salty....

Bill: They do the tablet checkout method when it came to paying with a card (no discover accepted) but what i didn't like was the manager holding the tablet and watching me leave a tip which made me uncomfortable. I felt an unnecessary pressure for something I should be comfortable about doing.

Some cons since it's the soft opening.
The staff are still new and learning what to do. So service is a bit slow and unrefined.

We came here about 730pm last night (Tuesday) still skeptical about giving this place another shot. We didn't wait to long but there was steady traffic but still enough cleared tables to sit us down quickly. 

Our server was Lisa
She was very knowledgable & patient. When I asked about half orders again (thinking they would do it this time) she replied no but she also pointed out which items on the menu were small portioned & able to share between 2 girls. She didn't brush us off or seemed annoyed with us asking for rice paper every time she passed by, she didn't mind that we order one item at a time & she communicated with us that she was going on break so that someone else would be helping us. Her service is the only reason why I am giving this place 5 stars instead of 2 again. I'd ask to be seated in her section when I come back!

The food... Seaweed salad has a very weird after taste, not too fresh. Brisket still tasted like it was brisket. Cajun calamari\/garlic calamari\/pork belly\/ short ribs were pretty good compared to last time. 

The portion of the rice paper sucks (5 sheets or so) I mean .. If all the reviews are about rice paper why not portion it right?",2,2,2

If you are looking for a Korean BBQ joint with an awesome variety of meats and appetizers Gen is the place to go. I personally will choose Gen over an other KBBQ restaurant in LV. You really get what you pay for, so I'd rather spend a little more to eat here than at another stop.

Now for my recommendations, you absolutely need to get their Beef tongue! This is by far my favorite meat dish because of the texture. Also the marinated steak is really good as well. On top of that their potato salad and tofu soup is delicious.

I came with my aunt and uncle who were visiting from California; they also had a friend from Taiwan with them. Even though we were only a party of four, we were seated at a table with two grills, which was nice. We came on a Monday night around 7PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.

Our waitress was rather nice and her shift ended during our meal, but our subsequent waiter was also quite attentive and friendly. 

The menu at each Gen is slightly different, but I feel like there were less items on the menu than the ones in California. The quality of the meat was good, but also not as good as California. There were fewer banchan and no rice paper here, and you have to ask for the daikon radish sheets. Portions in general are smaller, but since it is AYCE, just ask for more.

Overall, a solid meal at a fair price, but not as good as the California locations. Also, it was a little bit warm in the restaurant during our meal; you would think they would turn up the A\/C more given that it's summer in Vegas and there are a ton of barbecue grills running.",2,1,1

I'm so happy that Gen made its way to Vegas because I go to the one in Tustin ALL THE TIME since I go to school in Irvine. For $20, you really can't complain. They have a fantastic selection of good quality meats, along with some other goodies like fries, fried chicken, etc.

I went with a group of friends the night after they opened and we were a party of 9. They ended up splitting us up into two booths, which was understandable since we were a large group, but we saw that there were tables on the bar side of the restaurant that looked like they could've seated us. We figured they must've been reserved or something, but it sucked that we couldn't sit together and it felt awkward screaming across the aisle to the group at the other table. 

If you're used to more traditional KBBQ, you may not enjoy Gen. I'm Korean so I've had my fair share of KBBQ and Gen definitely keeps it simple. I was a little disappointed because they don't serve the steamed egg (gyeran jim) or the soybean soup (doenjang jigae) here. I also asked for rice paper, which I assumed they had since the Gens in CA have them, but the server told me that they don't serve that and he offered me tortilla wraps (?!)  in lieu of the rice paper. That was interesting. They were also sold out of a LOT of the appetizers when I went, but I guess that was understandable since they opened the day before. 

Service was eh. It was difficult to flag down a server at times, but the meats came out fairly quickly. The servings of meat was pretty inconsistent though. We ordered the steak multiple times and a couple were paper thin while a couple were thick slabs. When we ordered chadol, the first plate was full, but the next plate we got literally had 8 pieces.

The meats was very fresh, steaks, bulgogi, not so impressed with the cook your own calamari, the appetizer crispy calamari legs were great.  Chop chae not impressed, maybe it was from the night before.

My friend and I were dressed appropriately, and we were super nice to everyone who was serving the table. The servers pretty much ignored us, though, and when our waiter deigned to make eye contact with us on his way around the restaurant, he always seemed to be annoyed that we were bothering him asking for a refill and was bristling with impatience when we asked for more meat. He was overly polite to the couple next to us, though, even though they were quite demanding; maybe it was because we were an ethnic minority that night? 

Food and drinks took forever to get to us, and the portion sizes weren't consistent. We got a tiny little portion of beef bulgogi, so we asked for more, and the next time the portion was 3 times the size. It made it hard for us to judge how much to order, especially when you're charged extra for leftovers.

We ordered 2 orders of beef bulgogi, brisket, garlic squid, Cajun shrimp, popcorn shrimp, kimchi, spicy cucumbers, seaweed salad, veggies, fried squid and of course a Chardonnay. Warning! Orders of meat are decent sized orders. We ate almost everything because my bf took it upon himself to clean every plate.

It's also part of a chain, but do not let that detract you from coming here as this is one of those cases where the quality comes in stark contrast from its low price of 14.95-lunch and 19.95-dinner (that's WTF-cheap).  

Sadly enough, I was very disappointed to find that they did not serve fish cake as part of their banchan. Unlike my significant other, I'm not a HUGE fan of Korean BBQ, but I do love my fish cakes. I always order 5 servings every time I go to one. 

What I found very unique was their large selection of BBQ in comparison to other BBQ places. I believe  there's 32 options, including some, but not all of the appetizers. The only thing I'm disappointed about in their selection is that they don't have steamed egg. I feel like that's an absolute must AND classic anywhere you go!

My favorite meats (and we tried everything) at this location include the premium beef tongue, red wine pork belly, and the Gen chadol. I was particularly surprised to see the red wine, as that was an option that I have never seen at all at an AYCE before, and it tasted quite savory if you ask me. 

Don't come here for the appetizers even though the large amount may tempt you. Save your room for the meats as the appetizers are skip-worthy IMO. 

When you come, be prepared to completely serve yourself. Nobody's cutting your meat into bite-sizes for you or starting you off with grilling the first order. You get a scissors and some tongs and you are off on your own. I thought that was the fun part if you ask me, because I absolutely hate it when the servers do it for me. I feel it detracts from the experience. 


A solid AYCE BBQ place for an extremely competitive price. It's far from my area, but I really can't ask for anything more.",13,10,13

The food was delicious. When I found out that Vegas got a Gen, I was literally screaming with joy. Let me tell you, Gen is now my go-to Korean BBQ place considering that I used to be a die hard Tofu Hut fan. 

The service here is always amazing. When you get there and ask for a table, they'll kindly ask for your first name and last initial & phone number. The reason being for the phone number is because they text you when your table is ready. So you could walk around the mall if you wanted to, then return when your table is ready. What I found cool about their reservation service is that along with texting you when your table is ready, they also have an app called ""NoWait."" NoWait is an app where you can see the current wait time for the restaurant you're at. It shows you how many parties are in front of you. In this app, you can also add people in your party to show them your place in line. They also have a bar where you can chill while waiting for your table.

After being seated, they are really quick with drinks and orders. Considering my friends and I are regulars here, we already know what to order. Once we get seated, we start ordering by the boat loads. We always start by getting 3 orders of Japchae, #10, brisket and pork belly. Literally 2-5 mins later, the server is back with the orders. They check up on you every 10 mins or so, so that you can re-order. We always get the sesame chicken and the KFC. So good! Considering that we're asian, we need rice....and lots of it. This is sometimes a problem because they say ""sorry we're out of rice right now."" However, that doesn't stop us from chowing down on just meat. 

I like how the place is designed. It's very modern looking compared to the KBBQ places in china town. Every time I come here, we're always seated right away and the service is always fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this place but....MAKE MORE RICE PLEASE. I AM ASIAN AND I NEED MY RICE. That is all. oh wait one last thing:  K B B...really Q waiters\/waitresses. Just sayin' ayyyyye!",4,2,2

It's located outside of Galleria mall by JC Penny. Parking was a lil shit both days but they offer valet. Interior is veryyyy nice. One of the nicest kbbq restaurants I've been to (I haven't been to many). There's even kbbq stoves at the bar, I thought that was pretty freaking neat haha.

My first visit here was with one friend. We walked in and about a handful of workers looked at us then looked at each other like they didn't know what to do before a few of them finally greeted us. We only waited about 5-10 mins to be seated so it was not a bad wait. Our waiter was really nice, she already seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't hesitate to explain it. AYCE Lunch is about $14.99 while Dinner is $19.99, not bad!

Second visit was with a much larger group. Waiters still all over the place but I cut them some slack since they are still pretty brand new. You know, they forget my miso soup spoon, the straws, ask us if we ordered Premium Steak as we are CLEARLY ALL getting out of our chairs to leave lol. It's all good though, I'm still coming back!!

Anyways I wanted to get this salad issue  off my chest cuz I thought it was kind of funny. During my first visit, after we had placed our order, my friend and I noticed that the couple next to us, who was seated AFTER us, received their salad before us. Or at least we though it was their salad because the way it was placed closer to their invisible dividing line so we asked for our own. Even the couple wasn't sure if it was theirs or ours so no one ended up touching it. We end up getting our own, then like 30 mins into the waiter brings out a 3rd salad all confused but just sets it by them anyway. AND THEN when we were almost finished with the meal, a different waiter finally tells us ""oh that's your guys salad btw"" I was like -___- why would you put it on that couple's invisible dividing line then!?!? Gaaah man get your salad shit together lol. Anyways, the food!!


Favorites: The brisket, spicy pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, cajun shrimp, sesame chicken appetizer

Least Favorites\/or just straight up hated: Red Wine Pork Belly (hated), Miso Pork Belly, Regular Pork Chop or Pork belly (I think). 

The red wine pork belly literally just tasted like wine. I felt bad because I didn't care for it at all and neither did my friend who originally wanted it. The miso pork belly was slightly better. It didn't taste like miso at all and didn't have too much flavor. Now I THINK this was the pork chop, if that was even on the menu but all I know is that I didn't like it at all. It was probably the way we cooked it though but still, I just didn't really enjoy it.

The spicy pork bulgogi is a MUST. It was my most favorite out of everything. & brisket, well, I just love any brisket. It tasted like every other brisket. Nothing special but I really enjoyed it. 

Overall, the service could be better. I know they are all starting out but hopefully during my 3rd visit it will have improved. Food is pretty good for the price. Place is spacious and is a great place to eat after shopping!",2,2,2

The wait was very minimal, we came on a Wednesday night. It just so happened when we got seated they did their usual happy hour chant, or so it seems. My Jameson was only $5 and Sapporo $4, not bad. 

For those new to Gen, it is all you can eat (AYCE) and is $21 per person. It includes all the meats you expect and their sides too. The service was really good this night always checking up on us. As for quality, this was one of the best I've seen at a $20 AYCE place. Barely any fat at all on the brisket and they were not frozen either.

We instantly regretted coming here. First, out of all the booths that were free, they chose to seat us at a common table. We were placed at the end of the table blocked by a pillar, so we were ignored a lot. We were also seated next to the cart where the dirty dishes were literally being thrown in, so throughout our dinner we heard the clang of dishes ringing in our ears which made us uncomfortable. Our waitress wasn't friendly, she didn't smile, and when she left she neglected to let us know that another waiter would be serving us. So for a while we were waiting and looking out for her, and we felt like we had been forgotten. Our second waiter was nice and smiled a lot, but service was very slow. We were advised to order a few meats at a time, which we did, but twice we waited more than 15 minutes for our meat to arrive. When the hostess brought the bill and processed our payment, she asked if everything was fine. I told her it was just ok.

It was Tuesday at 6PM and the place was busy but not packed, there were free ready tables available, yet we had to wait - why? After waiting for few minutes we were walked to the table. Side dishes already on table - makes you wonder for how long these were there for. The side dishes selection, size and taste had a lot to desire. The place has high ceiling there's loud music and we had hard time to hear the waiter who was standing right next to us. We ordered their favorite meal #5 and #10. The waitress brought the meat to our table but started to serve it to a couple sitting next to us. The burner was not on. We called waiter to turn it on, he did. then you need to wait to have the burner plate to heat up - it never did. After about additional 5 minutes of waiting - the burner was still or again not working. We called the same waiter. He turned it on again. That was well over 15 minutes after we walked in with raw meat on the table and still cold burner. The burner was yet again not working. We called the waiter - again - he called manager. Do you know that manager has magic touch? Yeah he does and the burner was up and hot. In the meantime -since we were starving we ordered appetizers that is supposed to be ready to eat. The 1st round of the meat was already done and appetizer nowhere to seen. When we finished the #5 and #10 appetizer arrived. Taste wise - not much so far. Let's order some pork. Pork belly arrived - after we called waiter. Hey look the burner is off again. Called that guy and he turned it on. Got that pork going - at the end it was so greasy that most fat bacon has nothing on it. My wife refuse to swallow it. Then she ordered something that should fix the bad taste and improve bad experience. So how about chicken. Chicken arrived - hey look the burner is off again. OK that's it! Enough it enough. We call them to take that raw chicken away - paid the bill and left. Nobody came to talk to us to apologize or trying to remedy the bad experience.

The manager wasn't any help either and kept making excuses why they couldn't reverse the credit card transaction.  This problem took 20 minutes to sort out because of their incompetency.

The food was good but since the opening a few weeks ago, they have definitely reduced the size of their portions.  I know it is AYCE but some items take awhile to come out. The delay perhaps strategically causes you to eat less.

They have a decent menu and everything I tried, which was one of everything was actually pretty good. I went during lunch so I didn't have the opportunity to try EVERYTHING, but next time I will!

They DON'T do half orders, which is a complete shame and I was pretty upset about it. Considering I'm only one person! But not really a deal breaker, just silly that they don't allow you to do half orders. 

They did have radish paper, which is only thinly sliced radish, when I went. It was really tiny and pretty crappy. They gave me five slices of radish that were end pieces and completely folded over on itself. Pretty annoying to me. 

All in all it's a decent place. We'll see on the next trip how it goes!",2,1,1

I wanted to give them a month or so though. I understand the pressure on new businesses but today's visit was just totally insulting. 

Party of 9 for my cousins bday & they quoted an hour wait & they'll text once the table is ready. No problem, we totally understand it would be long. An hour later, we ask if it'll be any longer. ""5 more minutes, just cleaning the table."" This happened for another 45 mins. ""10 more minutes, just cleaning the table."" Nothing yet. Finally, we were informed that there are two booths available back to back, is that okay, they ask. Yes, but.. you're telling me that for 45 minutes, you weren't really cleaning the damn table?! You were just bluffing?! Oh hell no. We got to the table and there's a booth side by side. We asked if we could have that instead so we could interact with each other. She had to ask management if that's okay. It's common sense so it better be! Sigh..

We were finally seated & got our orders in. Received our food and cooked them. Asked for the rice and they said it will be coming in 20 mins bc they ran out. Are you serious?! By the time the rice came, we already ate the food cause we were starving. We ordered some more and waited another 30 mins for those to eat with our already cold rice. Oh, and our waters only came 30 mins into our meal after asking them several times. That should've been the first things you give to customers. 

Patience was running thin at this point because every single server we encountered had the nastiest attitudes. No smiles, no eye contact, slamming plates on the table..(except for one guy who tried to compensate for his co-workers' actions but it was too late). Really felt they did not want to be there at all and we were nuisances for ordering. It's AYCE isn't it?! You make us wait so long so.. hell yeah, we're hungry hippos now! 

You can only split the check 3 times so we did. 3 different servers came by and kept asking how and it got old repeating what we were saying. We waited at our table for 30 more mins for our checks. We finally walked up to the counter and asked where our checks were. They said ""Ummmmm.. Well...."" Okay, got it.. This is how you want to end an already crappy dining experience. Good job. 

Walked out of there & heard 5 other parties complaining about their experience. 

So there, you've been warned. I usually give a 2nd chance for places but this place is not one of them. Cousin's bday ruined. Thanks Gen!",11,2,3

Yeah sure, parking in the Galleria Mall Parking lot kills the authentic feeling other BBQ joints in China Town have (Yes, it's in the mall BUT it has an outdoor entrance so don't worry, shopping addicts) but you'll feel better once inside. The inside is designed to look sort of like a club, slightly obnoxiously loud pop music with a giant projector showing music videos in the background. I read a study once that eating with fast paced music makes you eat more. That was definitely the case at Gen today.... Or maybe it was that the food was too good. 

$14.99 for lunch, $19.99 for dinner. (Dinner price all day on the weekends!) The dinner menu includes a couple of extra plates, many are the same meats, but have the word ""premium"" in front. Lunch for me it is. 

Gen Chadol: Aka Brisket. Aka MY FAVORITE. Thinly sliced meat with a bit of visible fat, but none of that chewiness everyone hates. 
Beef Tongue: Small portion, very similar to the brisket, less fat than brisket. 
Bulgogi: Chewy, flavorful, chunks of meat with some onions. I don't need to explain it, it's a must for every trip to Korean BBQ. 
Smoked Garlic Pork Belly: We opted to order the garlic version rather than the plain pork belly, simply because it had a ""Chef recommended"" stamp next to it. It didn't have much of a garlic taste. It was basically thick slices of bacon. A little dry. 
Cajun Shrimp: Yes, yes, yes. Small portion! Peeling the shrimps a hassle, but totally worth it. 
Japchae: A little too oily and gooey for my liking. It did not have any meat or much of anything, but noodles. Skip it and save room for the meat. 

They have the usual small plate appetizers ready to eat on the table. Kimchi, cucumbers, pickled onion and mashed potato? Whatever, it was good. 
Rice is included if you ask for it.",6,2,5

I came here for the AYCE dinner and had the miso pork belly, spicy tofu soup, pork steak, bulgolgi, spicy octo... Okay, basically, I had ALL 32 options. Yes, it was good, but completely average when taking into account other options and the decent food could not overshadow the terrible service. See below.

2. Service = 5 punches to the throat
Upon arriving with a party of 4, we were told that there would be an hour-long wait for the underwhelming Korean BBQ experience (see above). Please note that you cannot make reservations here. However, after an hour, as we were slowly rotting away in the shadows, one of us sought an update and was informed that we had to wait yet another hour... and this was all while at least 5 tables around us were completely empty. Apparently, there's a policy that people who had put their names down before us would receive texts that their tables are ready and are given a 15-minute grace period to show up, but this is hardly effective if no one monitors that time limit and keeps open tables empty for 30 - 40 minutes while other parties are available in person to be seated immediately. Ultimately, we ended up waiting around 3 hours to be seated because we kept falling for the incremental increases to our wait and the false understanding that the food would be worth the lost time. I found a list of things that one can do with an extra hour due to daylight savings: http:\/\/www.inc.com\/kevin-daum\/24-things-you-can-do-with-an-extra-hour.html -- imagine doing all of those things THREE TIMES.

Unfortunately, my family and I had a really bad experience at this establishment. We were a party of 6 adults and 3 kids. We were given the table all the way in back, right next to the restrooms, and where the servers deposit dirty dishes (actually tossed them in a big container making loud noises thus scaring our kids). Since we were a big party gratuity was already included, and I strongly feel this is why our waitress service was crap. She rarely visited our table. She would walk pass our table and as we called her she'd ignored us. When our orders where actually taken, we had to keep asking different waiters about them because they took forever to be brought out. 

I left Gen Korean bbq house as a very unsatisfied customer, who spent $20.99(dinner price) along with her family. For the amount of money that my husband and I ended up paying with the additional $26 gratuity, which was added automatically, I expected our orders to be out in time and our drinks refilled.

We've been here twice now. We recently came right after Valentine's Day after they opened & they were pretty steady. Our waitress Alodia had a full section but she was very personable & friendly! They were out of rice for 45 min which I could see a lot of tables getting frustrated (we didn't really mind) but she made sure to keep on top of everything to try & compensate for the kitchen\/management's lack of preparedness opening up that day. She compensated for it very well & made the experience great despite the little hiccup of no rice for awhile. 

After a decent first experience & wonderful second one, we def will be returning! 

Ps: payment at the end is really convenient as well.",6,3,2

The service was fantastic thanks to Lisa and Krink who tagged teamed our table. They were on point every time with our high demands. 

If you are familiar with GEN then you know they set them selves apart from other KBBQ with their special marinades and wide selection of meats choices. Aside from brisket that I can eat all day, I recommend trying the Galbisal which is the marinated short rib steaks.. it is absolutely phenomenal.

Gens could have so much potential. A few things wrong with GEN. 
1. Not enough staff
2. Restricted menu. Everyone at the table have to order from the same menu. If you have kids that don't want BBQ, you have to settle for the kitchen menu. You can't mix and match.
3. Limited banchan, side dishes. You get 4. That's it. They call them ""seasonal"" but I call it lazy.
4. The spicy tofu soup took over an hour to make and served.
5. Service was pleasant but slow.

The service here is always hit or miss.  The first couples of times I've gone, service was a mess.  The burners would always go out because of the AC and we would have to be seated elsewhere after asking them to light the grill 5 times.  As of late, service has gotten a lot better!  Grills work well now and the food comes out in a timely manner.  They also offer rice paper now, but I'm still waiting for them to have steamed egg.

True fact: A LOT of people do come here. It is very busy all the time. Even on this unassuming Tuesday evening.  Friends that I know are not Yelpers are repeat customers.

Pro-tip: Be smart about the time you come or be prepared to wait. I have never waited more than 15-20 minutes the two times I've been here.  Arriving Tuesday at 6:40 PM. Seated at 7:00 PM. Dined 7:00-9:00.  I could see the hangry folks waiting from my table. The waiting area was packed from 7:00-9:00. Meaning diners like myself ate for 2 hours. No table turnover. Duh. So come early or come really late. You're welcome.

#1 - Gen signature steak - Want to feel like a pro chef? Season that baby with the salt and pepper from the little dipping dish. Bam!

#3 - Gen chadol - thinly sliced brisket. Get this. Like at least two times. It cooks very fast!

#5 - Gen beef bulgogi - thinly sliced, marinated sweet and savory. We got this twice. It comes with onions, get those on the grill too!

#8 - Beef tongue - Not bad!

#10 - Gen yangyum galbisal - marinated premium steak. Pretty good!

#15 - Spicy pork bulgogi - Great flavor! Not too spicy.

(In general, not a chicken fan when it comes to KBBQ)

Pork belly options: 

#17 - Smoked garlic pork belly - Least favorite. Garlic flavor was weak.

#18 - Red wine pork belly - Yummy! You can really taste the red wine. 

#19 - Miso pork belly - Yummy! Very tasty!

Seafood options? Too full to consider, but we did try the #22 garlic calamari and it was okay.

Other food items:
- Salad - Very good and fresh tasting
- KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - A bit sad. Not my favorite.
- Tofu appetizer - Looks nothing like the photo on menu. Grossly heavy breading. Skip.
 - Gyoza - Not mind blowing in any way. We got three times though. The kiddos enjoyed the crunchy treat.
- White rice - Needs a lot of improvement. For an Asian establishment, do not serve hard rice okay?
- Jap chae - 2 orders were sufficient for 5 adults. Not bad, not the best.
- Rice paper - not available. Boo!
- Radish paper - pretty good actually.
- Spicy tofu soup - It was okay. Did not taste ""authentic."" 
Did I enjoy my meal? Yes.
Would I come again? Yes.

This really is a generous 4, considering some flaws with customer service. I liked the food, so I'm not complaining.",16,9,11

We waited couple of minutes to be seated because the restaurant was packed that night but we never had to wait that long for our food. Our waitress and our hostess told us we have two hours for AYCE to finish and cannot leave extra meat un eaten and we will be charged (just like all other AYCE places) We ordered AYCE of everything beef.

This place has been open long enough for these guys to get a good flow of things, but I guess some take longer than others to learn. Why do I have to ask 4 times in a span of 35 minutes for my rice to come out? If there's something going on that's out of your hands, that's totally understandable. But you gotta let me know so I won't keep asking! But every time I come here, it seems they just keep forgetting. Same goes for radish paper and rice paper. It's ridiculous. And it's bad when you notice that your server only has 2 or 3 tables and they're still struggling. I'd love to grab a job here just so I can empathize how hard it is to work here, because they make it look so hard.  I really wanna give this place, at least a 3 but even some of their meat options are going down the drain and it hasn't even been that long! The brisket is always too dry.

The food could not have been better; we had the #10 steak (I'm not sure exactly what it is called), but it was absolutely delicious. The chicken and spicy pork bulgogi were all fantastic choices. Affordable prices, great for a date night, and a huge selection of foods for all-you-can-eat.

It was semi ""family style"" seating and semi private seating. There was also a large tv projection on the wall. However, the food was mediocre. Because we are cooking the food ourselves, I expected the food to be better spiced. In my opinion the only thing that wasn't bland was the edamame, which the customer doesn't cook. The cheese sauce from the garlic chicken tasted like Velveeta cheese. The service also sucked. We had to ask our grill to be changed out, ask for refills and they didn't ask if I wanted change for my bill until we asked them about it.

There are also a ton of options and variety which is great (wish they had 1 or 2 more veggie options).

The service was awesome! Everyone we encountered was very friendly, informative & knowledgable about the menu. I was warned by a handful of people that the service was bad so that was what I was prepared for. It was a pleasant surprise for me.
As we read the appetizer menu, our waiter informed us that they ran out of like 4 appetizers so we couldn't order it. Luckily we weren't planning to order those anyways & they still had the noodles we wanted! My 2 friends & I did AYCE. We ordered 2 of the briskets (number 3 I believe), some kind of bulgogi, & garlic pork belly. I feel like the brisket was too dry. I like Tofu hut's brisket better to be honest. My friends agreed with me on that one lol. My side of rice was a little dry. I didn't personally care for the pork belly but my friends said it was bomb. I liked the bulgogi.

The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working\/living in this part of Las Vegas.

Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.

There seems to be a lot servers\/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change). 

I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.

Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.

They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).

As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.

Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).

As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.

So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.

In closing, keep up the good job Gen KBBQ House & welcome to Las Vegas!

Pretty decent AYCE price, some good picks on the menu, and an overall unique vibe. With the huge spacious interior and counter-style seating areas, it almost feels like you're eating in a very modern adult-sized lunchroom.

My main issue was their lack of preparation and efficiency. This restaurant ran out of rice... RICE! We had to sit waiting with our ready-to-grill food for a solid 20-30 minutes before rice was served. If it was any other item, I wouldn't have knocked a star off my review - but any person who has had K-BBQ knows rice is the most necessary part of your meal. They also gave us a crazy small (and laughable) portion of edamame so I assumed they were low on that too.

I know they are reasonably new and having such a large restaurant (with so many mouths to feed) must be an adjustment, so I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and hope not to experience that same problem again. Our server was very nice to us and I'd easily come back again, especially during happy hour.",2,2,2

From what I heard, the portions are smaller here in Vegas but it's AYCE, just keep ordering. 

Just driving up to Gen I knew the wait was a little long and surely it was. definitely worth the wait. (Waited 1hr 30min on a busy night but didn't mind because we walked around the mall)
Waiting area was pretty small but The texting feature they have was awesome. Better than waiting outside, not hearing your name get called & losing your spot in line.

Glad this location is far from the other KBBQ spots because if they opened up in Chinatown, they'd put the other KBBQ spots to shame. Ha.

I ordered a variety of meats like I usually do, and of course it's a little busy, so a wait time is to be expected. But what really disappointed me was waiting 30 minutes for an appetizer, KFC chicken. When we started seeing multiple plates of it being served to other tables we asked what was going on? We were informed the fryer was not working and they were down to one. Eventually our chicken came out and it was cold. 

At this point, we asked to speak to a manager. He came to our table and we asked him if he knew if the fryer was down. He seemed very confused. So not sure if a fryer was down or they just forgot about our dish. But either way, neither the manager or the waitress apologized\/tried to make things right.

The meats came out quickly and with generous cuts, our drinks were refilled in a timely manner, they offered to change the grill twice, and we even ordered 2 green tea macarons for dessert at the end which is an extra charge.

I went here with my girl to get the Hawaiian steak the LA locations have, unfortunately they did not have it at this location. Bummer but still hungry so lets go

Food 3\/5
I had high expectation, unfortunately they were barely met. Quality was good especially on the marinated items but they did not come to par from the LA Locations. I would say the barely exceed the quality of tofu hut. Which for 5$ less i would definitely go to tofu hut.

Service 3.5\/5 ......
This part is tricky, The waiters and staff were very friendly. Except we sat next to this couple and as they were paying out the host was making small talk and ASKED them if they knew what yelp was and asked them to write a good review with their servers name. Because they were having a competition. Well that definitely knocked me back. Em not opposed to the competition because that is good motivation for the team. BUT ASKING someone to write a good review and shout out the server. Very unprofessional. Had i not overheard this it would be a 5\/5.

One thing that is SUPER surprising is the price point for this place! It is about $5 cheaper than all the AYCE Korean BBQ joints that i have been to so far, although all the ones i have been to may have been mainly in California. Since i have been to the GEN in Cali, i was expecting pretty much the same thing. I was WRONG.... i also decided to come here a little while after they had opened so that they could get all the trial stuff out of the way. They still have MORE to work on in my opinion.

We had one of the NEW servers take care of us which I THINK his name was YOUNG-UHN?.... ahahahha something along that line he was great service wise. Although his first day on his own he did quite well taking care of us especially w\/ his up beat personality. He kept us up to date w\/ anything that may have taken some time. A bit disappointed when we asked the manager for a refill on salad & did not get it right away especially when you are a manager... 

The meat was OK... the best thing was the BEEF BELLY & MISO PORK BELLY. I typically love the PORK JOWEL meat but it had a nasty old stench to it & it wasn't even slices it was just the whole chunck of it =\  

REGARDLESS.... I probably may be back when I'm in the area... definitely would NOT go out of my way to crave it like I would in Cali.",5,3,5

I've heard soo much about this place and we finally tried it. It being Mother's Day we expected to wait long. Longer than the wait we had. Given it was Mother's Day we actually didn't wait long. I checked in at 4:30pm and was told it was going to be a 60-90min wait. They took my name and phone # and texted me when we were close. We were seated by 5:30pm and out the place by 6:45pm! Impressive!

The service was spectacular! From the start to the end and everything in between! It was a well oil machine, in my opinion. Ordering was easy as the server had iPads (or some electronic device) that they used to input our order as we spoke and the food was out to us in minutes. They had servers to take our orders, bus persons for drinks and ""runners"" as I call them serving our food. From one order to another, wait was minimal. We even had someone offer us a grill change in between! The meat was nice and fresh. Selections of meat was outstanding and to top it off they had appetizers that were included in the AYCE price of $19.95! 

The place was more of a lounge feel. Dimmed lights and loud music. It was nice! I definitely think it's more for adults because of the feel but it was still a kid friendly restaurant. They had spacious booths and walkways. I personally won't take my kids with us here but if you had to, there's no harm as several families had babies to kids with them. 

Another thing I loved was the place was not smokey! We didn't leave smelling like Korean bbq like we would at any other kbbq joint. They had the new grill that had the vents on them and smoke went directly in. It was awesome!

Will definitely be back for more date nights or girls night for sure!

The best part is that it's $20 for AYCE which is awesome. I hope it stays this way bc I will come back like every week. I hope it's not a thing where they get a lot of people and then raise their price. They should open another on the southwest side of town lol

After my friend heard about this place on NPR and seeing so many great reviews, my friends and I made the long trek out to Henderson in search of some great AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ.  Unfortunately, this did not end up being the mecca of KBBQ we had hoped it to be...

Firstly, the decor was weird! It was very modern and young, like it was trying to cater to KPOP teenage fans or something. It was also way too clean to be authentic...If I can't smell the BBQ, that's not a good sign!

Second, the BBQ was only OK. At least they had bulgogi\/steak\/pork belly\/ spicy pork....but they didn't have galbi....like no marinated bone in short ribs in sight! What? Also, the portion sizes when they came out were kinda small....but I guess since it's AYCE, it doesn't really matter. I will say that the jap chae noodles were garlicky and delicious and I may have ordered like 3 plates of it :) Also, for $20\/pp it's a good deal.  

Finally, the service was HORRIBLE. I mean, who are you hiring, Gen? High schoolers? These kids had no idea what was going on, told really odd\/weird\/inappropriate jokes, forgot to bring us multiple items (sauces, ordered meats, water), and honestly didn't listen to us half the time when we asked about items on the menu.

--
Us: ""what is the difference between the premium pork and the regular pork?""

Tip: the saucy dishes will take longer to cook b\/c it coats  the grill, turn the grill on max when you first turn it on so you can get a good sear then lower as necessary :)

Today was the first time I've ever been there but honestly, it beats most of the Korean places I've been to.  The food was awesome and the waiter was amazing.  There's an adorable waiter named James and when me and my friends told him it was the first time we came there, he recommended us all the good food.  The service was amazing, our cups where always full and the food came fast onto our tables.  Honestly, I wished I lived closer to this place so I could come here all the time.  Not only where the waiters and food awesome, but the decor in this place was also amazing.  All of the girls I came with, fan-girled over the waiters and I don't blame them.

Worth waiting for, and worth coming on the opening night.  Didn't seem to have any teething issues with the service, no confusion etc typically associated with an opening- everything was spot on.

The price:  19.99 per person AYCE, a bargain for LV, as all of the other places in town are a few $ more.

The ambience:  Not a normal AYCE BBQ place- more of a laid back modern vibe with nice decor, music, and lights. Almost like a bar with cozy white leather booths, huge tv, and great view of the mountains.

The food:  32 choices for the AYCE- a lot of different marinated beef choices, chicken and pork.  Tonight had the #1Gen Signature steak (Not recommended- chewy and no flavour), #3 Gen Chadoi (Highly Recommended- very very tasty), #5 Gen Beef Bulgogi (very good also- nice marinade flavour), #14 Cajun Chicken (Nice sauce, spicy and deep flavoured), #17 Smoked Garlic Pork Belly, and #32 Miso Soup (Very rich and good Miso base).

It comes with the usually side dishes which were laid out before getting to the table, so they were not fresh- they should be brought out after you sit down, they were mostly left untouched because either hard or a bit dryer out.    The salad and Jap Chae glass noodles were constantly refilled because they were eaten so quickly.

The grill is nice, it doesn't smoke upwards, the venting pulls it down, and you can't hear it at all, and doesn't leave the typical grease spatters on the table.  Changing the grill was done frequently, but the guys doing it simply picked up the old *hot & oiled* grill and run off with it.  No cart, no tray, no towel, nothing.  I wonder how long until someone burns themselves or slips on the oil dripping from it.  Opening day glitch maybe...

  Easy payment, swiped at the table with a square, and ready to go.

Definitely coming back here- and skipping all the other Korean BBQ in town at this point- all the rest are overpriced, dirty and random.

Thank you for coming to LV, GEN!!!",5,3,3

The crap service in my experience came from the hostess stand not so much the server. We walked in at 5:30 and the place was packed. We were told the wait for a table would be 30-35 minutes, whereas the bar would be available in 5-10. We opted for the bar, and the hostess took our name, asked us for ID and said we just had to wait for them to set up the bar seating. We waited about 15 minutes, watching the bar seats get pulled over and the ban chan placed around the burner. Meanwhile a couple walks up and I see them getting carded as well, thinking oh they've chosen to sit at the bar too. I see a short conversation between the hostess that took our name and the one carding the new couple, then she turns around and leads the couple to the seats we had already waited 15 minutes for. I immediately look to the the girl that took our name and she responds ""She didn't know you were waiting, I'm sorry."" She spoke while rolling her eyes and talking as if she could care less that we were inconvenienced. We then had to wait about 5 more minutes for another place to be set up. I was so mad, by the time we sat down the other couple that bypassed us already had meat cooking on their grill. When we ordered, it literally took 15 minutes for our first plate of meat to come out. The spicy baby octopus was the first to arrive. I do like that the portions are small, so you can try many things without being too stuffed. The pork cheek was too thick and tough, and was void of flavor. The premium steak wasn't ribeye, but was still tasty. The smoked garlic pork belly was salty and smoky deliciousness. The red wine pork belly was good but very sweet. The pork steak and the spicy pork bulgogi might have been my favorites. The garlic calamari was flavorless. They were out of squid. The garlic chicken with nacho cheese was underwhelming. The marinated premium steak was small but tasty with a sweet pineapple ring on top. The beef tongue was a bit bland. I will say that sitting at the bar has its benefits as you're able to ask your server across the bar for drink refills and meat refills. All being said, if you show up when they're not busy, or stand far enough away from the hostess stand to not notice them shuttle in people that came in after you, you might enjoy your experience here. As for me, I'll be trekking back Hwaro to get my fix.",5,1,1

So the service has always been wishy Washy for me. Some days it'll be on point. We get more than one drink refill and will be asked a good amount of times for meat orders. Other days I'll get one round and half of my appetizers before I feel full feel waiting for the waiter to order again. Ozzy and I think her name was Jessica. They were always attentive and I think for being the only kbbq spot I know In Henderson. I'm happy with what is here. 

The four stars is for the iffy service, and the fact their bathroom floors are always sticky. I know you're busy .. But I like leaving a restaurant without worrying if my flip flop will want to stick around when I walk out.

If you like beef tongue, it's only available in the dinner menu. There's no desserts here but they have more side dishes you can choose from. I also like that they give you small portions at a time  so you don't overwhelm yourself. It's very new, clean and really good. I gave 4 stars because their gen signature premium steak tasted really bland- it was cooked right & texture was right but I'm pretty sure they forgot the flavor. Also saw some tables (booth) were 6 people are seated but it looked like there should only be for 4. They also have the high tables which is not okay if you're going with kids. Also, this place is much smaller to the one I went to in California so there might be a wait time unless you call for reservations. They recently opened so expect it to be busy.

My servers Seaver and Minju were awesome and everyone should ask for them ! 

Now my favorite part... THE MEAT ! My personal favorites and must tries are the beef tongue and pork cheek. The beef tongue is unlike any I've tried because of how the taste,texture, and thickness of the cut. Other good choices I tried were the garlic chicken and the galbi.

Salad and Japche (noodles) also followed. So good! 
He recommended the red wine pork belly -  very flavorful, thick pieces!
Also had the brisket, steak and beef bulgogi... all good but small portions. 
We had to ask for better pair of scissors because it was really tough to cut the steak with the ones they gave us. 
They don't have short ribs but had something similar...it's the number 10 probably my favorite.

First off the weaknesses that other diners have mentioned are mostly all true. Service is very good, but who is who in there? It seemed like we had a main server, but then several random people would come over and help us. We ordered our drinks, but the food came before our drinks. We had already started cooking our meats, when a lady came over and asked if we had ordered drinks, we said we did, but it had not arrived yet, but she went and got them in a hurry. Now I am thinking we might get another set of drinks from the guy that first took our order, but he didn't bring them. Oh yeah, we first ordered coke, but the server said they had pepsi, we said that is fine. Then when we were asked the second time and we said we ordered 2 pepsi's the other server said they only had coke. Whatever! we'll take it! (huff!)
The meats come at a super rapid pace, they must have them ready and plated in the back room. The classic standard ""Bul (fire) gogi (meat)"" was seasoned properly and the meat was tender for the most part. Lana and I both experienced a fatty inedible ""super ball"" of fat that should have been trimmed off in the kitchen, but they let it go through. The short rib meat (less the traditional bone) was really good. Lana also ordered the steak and she didn't like it, but I did. The table top grill was on full blast and we asked for the power level to be turned down and it helped the cooking process. The inherent drawback of this style of dining is that if you are not paying attention, the meats will not be properly cooked. I hardly took a single bite since I was keeping an eye on the cooking process. The food cooks fast, so take a bite and resume cooking and flipping the meats. The in table ventilation system is as reported, nearly all the smoke is captured as you grill and there is no excessive smoke or odor on you clothes when you leave.
I tried some of the suggestions other diners recommended, some were good, some not so good. The agedashi tofu was soft and undercooked, it was just cooked tofu and sauce. The crispy squid was OK, nothing special, some were overcooked and I did get one bite that was delicious, the remainder was hard cooked rubber bands. Towards the end of the meal, I remembered the ""KFC"" (Korean Fried Chicken) and I ordered one to see how it was. The pictures on Yelp from other diners had it as a small side dish, but mine was like a double order and it was not all that great, akin to Panda Express orange chicken with some Korean chili pepper flavoring. The bad part was that some of the chicken was tough and kind of tasted like tough tendons and junk. I had to cover most of it up with my paper knapkin cause it was a gamble to see if the next bite was good or something unedible. I didn't complain about it and I didn't want to be charged extra for not eating everything I ordered.
The various side dishes (ban chan) was good, I asked for some extra potato salad, but never got it. (I was getting full anyways). Another server asked if we wanted more kimchi and was said, ""sure"", but he never brought it either. Once again, we were about done anyhow. I noticed some guy in the kitchen slicing away with the meat slicer machine, but that is kind of a bad sign since Korean BBQ meat should take a while to marinate then be served, but it could have been he was slicing more for dinner, so I'll just pretend I didn't see that.
The restaurant is very modern and stylish, it's only been a few weeks since they opened so things are clean and in good condition. We only had to wait about 15 minutes to be sat, so that isn't too bad for a Saturday afternoon. The Hostess went through her speech, but she spoke so fast I could not understand most of it, not a big deal since I know the dos and don'ts of Korean BBQ. All day Saturday and Sunday is $19.95 and I guess lunch during the weekdays is $14.95, with dinner prices after 3pm to midnight increasing to $19.95. Pretty good prices for All you can eat with a 2 hour time limit.
We noticed one corner table with some big guys having lunch and they surely got their monies worth, they did some damage!
Overall very good and I don't need to order stuff to try out next time, I know what to get and what not to repeat. AND they should offer rice to every diner, that is like Mexican food without tortillas!
Final note as others had mentioned, we could not get our check! We said we were done so our main server cleared out dishes and he still went on serving other diners. I asked someone else and they acknowledged me, but still no check! I just left the tip on the table and we paid up at the counter. We'll be back again after a while, they still need to get their routine down.",1,0,1

The interior of the restaurant is super nice and not comparable to most KBBQ spots, the food is plated\/presented in a more upscale fine dining type of way, and I love that they serve a bunch of sides\/cooked items, included in the AYCE price. But let me tell you...if you're going to seat seven people with one grill, at least bring enough meat to actually satisfy everyone simultaneously. This place has got tricks up their sleeves with the plating they use for their meats and sides. I mean, one tiny little plate of kimchee for SEVEN people? You got to be kidding me! It was a joke and kind of insulting in my opinion to be served ONE side of kimchee for seven ravenous individuals. We even asked for seconds and still got served the same amount. Gen, your concept of AYCE lacks the whole idea of what All you can eat Korean BBQ is all about! I was just a tad bit baffled. Lol. I don't mean to offend the establishment but try places on spring mountain or elsewhere and see where I'm coming from. 

Other than that, the quality of the meats were mediocre. I had better at other KBBQ restaurants that were a lot more tasteful. In all honesty, this place seemed more of an Americanized feel. If that even makes sense. I wish I got pictures but I had such a long day and forgot to charge my phone battery. I wouldn't suggest this place nor will I refuse to come back. You'll probably see me back here if someone else suggests it and it's out of my power to disagree. Still sticking to Doh on Rainbow.",4,2,4

Our waiter Bo, was an awesome waiter! He was very nice, & always made sure to stop by our table often so that we had everything we need. He told me that he felt like he didn't do a great job at serving us, but I disagree. I've done my fair share within the food industry, & know a hard worker when I see one. Now onto the food. This place was very clean organized compared to Tofu Hut or other places I have been too. I didn't even have to question myself whether or not the food was safe to eat. Their sauce to dip the beef in was absolutely delicious. It had a hint of vinegar and sweet soy sauce I believe. Many KBBQ places I have been to don't really have a great selection of dipping sauces (most of them just look like straight up oil). I also enjoyed their salad. My mom doesn't eat rice so we literally ordered like 4 plates of salad with extra sauce (cause that's how we like it). The meat was very good as well! The brisket is always good anywhere you go, but I was surprised they had the boneless Kalbi beef (we're used to getting the one with bones). Definitely get the chicken appetizer, you won't regret it. Also the bulgogi was very flavorful & tasty. I gave them 4 stars because they don't have a desert selection (which I was highly disappointed about), & they ran out of edamame & Cajun fries during the time we went. All in all, definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it. & they have a pretty cool electronic hand held device thingy to pay with if you're paying with a card. I thought that was unique compared to other restaurants I've been to.

4 Food
5 Service
4 Value

The food was good...we stuck mainly with the thin ribeye, bulgogi and the galbisal out of the dozen or so options offered. The spicy pork bulgogi was also a hit. 

I like my Kimchi a little more funky\/strong but I'm an unusual white boy. I also wish they offered full lettuce leaves with which to make an Asian lettuce wrap with the grilled meat rather than the lettuce strips in a bowl.

Appetizers:

STAY AWAY from anything that is fried\/breaded as the breading was way heavy. Popcorn shrimp: 80% breading (seriously could not see the shrimp) Pork cutlet 60% breading. Fried squid about 70% breading...and the breading was salty. No thanks. 
DO GET the K.F.C chicken. It's like orange chicken but with a slightly spicy Korean sauce coating it.

I see people complaining on yelp about having 4 different servers and not knowing who their server was...I see this as a positive. Due to the amount of servers floating around, my glass was never half empty, the side dishes were always refilled, our next round of meat orders were taken even before the current one could hit the grill. Our grills were changed frequently without having to ask. Waiters were friendly and extremely attentive. Why would I want to hunt down ""my server"" if I needed a grill change? I felt things ran smooth.

Value was spot on. For $20 I walked out extremely satisfied. I could definitely see myself coming here monthly if they opened one up in Summerlin...driving way out to the bowels of Henderson is a schlep.",5,3,4

The recently opened Gen is at the Galleria at Sunset mall in Henderson. The restaurant is not attached to the mall however. It is located directly to the left of the main mall entrance. 

I have been long awaiting a good KBBQ joint since I moved to Vegas. And as luck would have it, it just opened in Henderson!

I visited the second day of opening so things were still being kicked into gear with the staff and service so I can forgive some blips that we had like missed orders and the waitress dropping a glass of water on my friend. (ooops)

The AYCE menu is extensive and very reasonably priced imo. $14.95 for lunch (open-3pm) and $19.95 (3pm-close)! Appetizers are included in the price as well. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu with a few 'premium' items left off. 

Of note, I really enjoyed the chadol (beef brisket), beef tongue, spicy rice cake, garlic pork belly and agedashi tofu! Granted, there wasn't anything I didn't like, but you get the idea. They were missing the pineapple steak from the menu, however. And I wasn't a huge fan of their side dishes :( There is no rice paper here but they do give you thin radish slices to wrap everything in!

They also serve alcoholic beverages but I didn't indulge this time around. The parking is also plentiful in the mall lot. The decor is very swanky and modern which I enjoyed and there is greattttt ventilation (which my KBBQ veterans will know is very very important)

 We asked for forks from 4 different people, when Jaenica again was the ONLY person that informed us that they were out of forks, and took it upon herself to even clean some for us, thank you!  We even asked for refills on water 3 times and they got refilled once!

Food: You can choose from tons of different proteins and veggies including spicy baby octopus, kalbi beef, chicken, and shrimp. There are appetizers such as gyoza and the freshest salad. There are relishes like kim chi, sweet potato mash, and bean sprouts on your table as well as spices and dipping sauces to make your food your own. For around $22+ a person, the possibilities are endless! 

Service: We always have the nicest servers at Gen. We've been for birthdays and on other evenings and never have to wait long for food or drinks. They even change out the grills per your request if you want to avoid mixing seafood and chicken and beef etc.

Mainly, hungry, but I'm forgiving too. I dragged along my brother and cousin (everyone needs a sidekick) while my five-year-old was in school. They've always wanted to try it, and so I saw that this was my opportunity to see if my first impression on this place still stands.

Remember last time I told you all that their brisket was very chewy and ew? Not this time! It was definitely melt-in-your-mouth goodness this time around! I fell in love with it so bad that I we ordered SIX of these babies. You heard (err... READ) me right! I said SIX! My brother wanted to try the bulgogi, so he ordered beef and pork bulgogi. Yo.. The pork bulgogi WINS everything! It was so damn delicious. I don't know what it was, but this is definitely the best bulgogi that I've ever had. The beef was pretty good too, but I'd order the pork over the beef all day, err' day! 

Service was the same as last time. We had an attentive server. I don't know her name because either A). I forgot her name or B). she never gave it to us. She was cool, though. Let me tell you what WON my little visit there. It's the fact that they were playing old school hits. No, not Stevie Wonder or BeeGees. But I'm talking about old R&B songs from the early 2000s (i.e. Dilemma by Nelly ft. Kelly Rowland). My brother straight up told me, ""It's like they stole your (first generation) iPod and plugged it in."" I was really feelin' myself when we were eating there. I wanted to stay just for the music.

I don't know if they changed their little SH*T ""EVERYONE AT THE TABLE MUST PAY FOR AYCE EVEN IF IT'S JUST TWO PEOPLE EATING IT"" RULE because my entire little posse and I all ordered AYCE lunch. That's why I didn't give them 5 STARS.

First and foremost the place looks great. It's located right next to the galleria mall and has giant signs, so you can't really miss it. The inside looks fancy and their seating is comfy. We went on a Sunday during lunch time so it was getting busy, but we got seated in no time. At first everyone was super friendly, we had a really nice guy who kept asking if we got our order and drinks in, but it just went downhill after that. After we got our first wave of food in, we waited for a waiter to ask us if we needed more, but no one came. We then asked the bus boy if we can order more food and he said ""of course"" and whispered to the waiter who was taking an order at the table next to us, but after he finished he walked away, and so we waited. 15 more minutes, no one came, so we asked another girl who walked by if we can order, and she said she would get a server to us. Then another 10 more minutes went by and with no food on our grill, we stopped another person and they were a server, so he got our order in (but forgot the sesame oil). We got our food, but still no sesame oil, until a really polite girl walked by and we asked and she obliged. When we finished we asked a waiter for our check. While we were waiting we were trying to get a water refill, and was completely ignored by a waiter with a jug of water after yelling out ""excuse me"" who proceeded to fill up the table behind us and walk. We finally got someone to refill our water and our green tea, but was still waiting for our check. About 20 minutes after asking for the check we finally decided to give up and walk up to the counter where we tried to pay, but was rudely denied by the lady at the counter who said we had to pay at our table. We told her that we've been waiting 20 minutes for the check, and she sarcastically said ""really? That long"" but luckily the lady who seated us early defended us and agreed that it was been quiet awhile since we've been here. She was happy to get our check and apologized over and over again for their lack of service.
All in all their food was alright, but for a restaurant that has a country wide franchise I really expected the service to be quicker. It always may have to do with the fact that the servers pretty much have a free for all because they don't have sections and don't keep track of what stage of the eating process each table are on.",2,1,0

First for all, the sides were great. The kimchi, pickled veggies, seaweed salad, and potato salad were on point. Unfortunately, they didn't have all of the sides but I was pleased with what I had.

The JAP CHAE was beyond YUMS! The beef bulgogi was super tasty, too  and I really enjoyed the kalbi (but I think it was other another name) I wasn't too keen on the pork belly or the squid. Spicy chicken was pretty tasty, but I would recommend ordering chicken first since it takes so long to cook.

This restaurant is located at the Galleria Mall. Service is inconsistent... there are good days and bad days but mostly good. Selections vary and the quality of the food is okay. 

Theres some days when the flame of the grill can be low or hot. Whenever it's low, it takes a really long time for it to cook. 

We always get the pork bulgogi, GEN premium steak, pork belly, beef tongue, and Red Wine steak. They also have appetizers like gyoza and the jap chae. Sides are unlimited, of course. Everything legit tastes better with the sauce though. Stay away from the beef bulgogi. We ordered the beef bulgogi once and it wasn't that great. Another thing is that they dont have steamed egg which can be disappointing.

Meat and more meat and more meat. Beef Tongue unreal good. They do serve other proteins and a good variety of side dishes. I feel family style of cooking your own food in front of you makes it fun for everyone, entertaining, and good times. 

I read that few yelpers have had problem with the service. Maybe it helped that went early before 6pm meet up with friends for dinner. By the time left around 7pm the place was crazy busy. I think overheard someone say easy over hour wait. Early is the way too go. We had wait but nothing crazy like hour. Really from the minute sat down feel like the service we got was nothing but five star. Once we started ordering I was surprise but the raw protein and the side dishes was bam bam bam coming out one after another. It was pretty darn fast our plates was piling up around the grill. Since there was five of us just about ordered the whole menu. The main things I ordered or should say got my AYCE in was the Beef Tongue and Japchae. The only other AYCE Korean been in Vegas is Sura. The last time went they never had Beef Tongue or was out. The Japchae I believe they never offered. Both are right up on top for my favorite Korean food in general. Both were awesome at Gen Korean BBQ House. The Japchae could have ordered that all night be totally happy in life. The gyoza was solid. Pork Cutlet another solid dish. Bulgogi another one of my favorite was tasty. The chicken I would pass on order the other stuff. The dipping sauce found interesting that came with it and suppose you dip it before or once it done. Any case just never worked besides it does take longer too cook then some of the other proteins. The head on shrimp friend order seriously  waste of time. It lot of work just get little pieces of meat and takes forever cook. The pork belly looked good have two different ones on the menu. Friends ordered both. Our glasses never had empty glass the whole time. They checked after round two if need was grill plate changed up. Our server was friendly and no problem separate checks. 

The interior was very modern. I had no idea that walked into Korean BBQ. The minute you walk in see  nice open bar area with couple wide screen that can hang out while wait. Or might be able eat there just never walked by but it the first thing notice walk in. Nice high ceilings always plus for BBQ cause so many people cooking can get smoky. Think with the place being packed packed be really loud but not bad and you can have great conversations over dinner with friends. I had no idea the place was outside or part of the Galleria Mall.

I decided to give it a 4 due to the cleanliness of the place and neat use of iPads for ordering\/paying. This restaurant caught me by surprise as they had some technological equipment.

I went during dinner and for the price of $19.99, you can't really complain too much. This is dirt cheap (well, not as cheap as SoCal) and will definitely be a great place after a workout or if you're just feeling super hungry\/hungover. For a party of two, we waited about 40 minutes. Instead of waiting at the restaurant, the hostess took our number information down and said we'd get a text message when our table was ready. Loved this concept. I forgot which platform they used, but great job! 

The quality of meat was fairly decent for all the beef dishes. I hated cooking the shrimp, but that was me. There was a mix-up in the beginning and they delivered plates that weren't ours. 
No worries.

Appetizers (included in the price): I tried their popcorn shrimp and it tasted kinda stale. The fried squid legs were OK. I was not a fan of the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) as it tasted like Panda Express's orange chicken that was left outside for hours. The edamame wasn't that great either (seriously, how can you mess that up?!)

Service was really slow and our waiter looked consistently overwhelmed. It was clear he couldn't manage the number of tables. Once a server comes to your table, they enter your orders into an iPad Mini and the order gets sent straight to the kitchen. Servers would then bring you your orders within minutes, which was awesome. It seemed super efficient at first, but that's only if you got your waiter's attention.

Pro-Tip: Order all your dishes in advance because the turnaround time for ordering dishes is unpredictable. They also replace your grills too periodically, which was good. I was slightly confused why they didn't pre-grease their grills as our meats got constantly stuck on there. 

Overall, this place was a solid 4-star restaurant that I wouldn't mind going again.",5,5,4

For three of us, one order of brisket = 5 pieces. One order of kimchi = 3 pieces. Tasteless salad dressing, and the spicy tofu soup tasted like recycled miso soup with some chili oil. 
Reminds me of the Red Lobster unlimited shrimp scam, where they make you wait 20 minutes for 5 more pieces of shrimp, in the the hopes that the customers get tired of it and leave.
Pick the lowest rated Korean BBQ on Spring Mountain, and it'll be heads and shoulders above this one. If this survives the next three months, it'll be only because there is no other Korean BBQ in the area.

It was a birthday dinner with family.  We had no problem waiting for almost 1 hour 20 mins.  They take us to the tables.  Yes!! We were seated at 2 seperate tables then was told we would be charged an 18% gratuity for party of 6 or more.  We then ask for a manager and was sent an inexperienced hostess as a reprensentative for a manager.  We told her how long we waited just to be seated at 2 separate tables as a family and on top an 18% gratuity for 6 or more.  The hostess then blames us and says ""Did you tell the hostess you wanted to sit together?  If not then thats not our fault.""  Last time I checked saying party of 8, its implied and common sense says we're here together to sit together and eat together.  I have never ever been seated at different tables  w\/large parties in my life. We could have only waited10-20 mins to sit seperatly instead of almost an hour 20 mins.  Then I asked her to justify the 18% gratuity.  We were split up, we are no longer a party of 8, there is only 4 being served in our group.  We should have left then.  We ordered drinks and 2 drinks didn't come til meal was almost over after notifying them numerous times that we're still waiting for drinks.  Same with food, everytime we put an order in they forgot 1 or 2 items and after asking and being told it was on its way, it never came.  I don't know how the other half of our party faired but I doubt it went well.  They didn't look happy and left about 45mins before our group.

The first was definitely a 5 star experience which was why we returned with friends for the second time. On the first visit, the restaurant was exceptional with friendly staff and fast service!  The food was great and it was so much fun!  We brought some friends for lunch today and I have to say it was embarrassing that we recommended it. The waiter introduced himself then proceeded to give us a list of several rules we needed to follow. We were to pay dinner prices at lunchtime, and he repeated that if we left any food uneaten at the table we were to be charged extra. People don't want to sit down at a restaurant and hear a bunch of rules from the waiter in the first minute after being seated. I would change that. While we were sitting at the table, my friend's husband came in for a quick visit before heading to work and sat down at our table. The waiter came over and asked what he wanted to drink and he said he wasn't eating and that he would be there just for a minute before going to work. The waiter then told him that if he was sitting at the table he would be charged the full price of $19.99 and that was their policy. Needless to say my friend's husband was insulted and left upset.  He was literally staying for a couple of minutes just to see his wife before work.

My hostess seated me quick and explained the process of how KBBQ worked thoroughly and most importantly simply. My waiter was David if I remember correctly and he always managed to check my table despite the place being close to a full house at the time, needless to say the service there was really good. 

Onto the food, I got the 32 item dinner and ordered I think 9 different items, 5 of those being appetizers. I loved the appetizers, they were delicious and were cooked already. With that being said, if you're like me and tend to burn things when you cook because you have bad judgement, the other entrees somewhat vary on your own grilling skills. For me burning almost all of my raw entrees, they were all still really really good (I also only really ordered the spicy foods so I can't really speak on behalf of any of the other item choices) and I was so full by the end of it I ended up spending at least 15 minutes in the bathroom.

Since we're on the topic, they've got one of the nicest bathrooms I've ever been to. The dark toned color scheme and dim lights made it really easy on the eyes, I felt as if I was in Van Gogh's starry night, it was so serene. Not only that but the height from the floor to the toilet seat was perfect. I am a 5'5 male, a little short compared to Nevadans, but I swear either that toilet was made for me or I was made for it, didn't even have to go on my toes and get that awkward position where your legs go numb. Not only that but there was a side rail for stability so I didn't have to awkwardly hold my knees or hips, also thought I'd mention it was at the perfect height that just seemed to cater to the comfort of my arms. The toilet seat also wasn't one of those weird small circular seats that just cuffed your butt and suctioned it down as if that would be the spot you'd die in, but an innovative oval-esque shape ending with a pointed tip, seriously, when I call it a porcelain throne, I mean It. Don't even get me started about that rectangular edged iron cast canyon that is the sink, the possible hand washing techniques that could go on in there.....just endless. Gen\/10 would eat all the spicy food at Gen again just to reclaim the throne.",2,2,2

WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE NOW 
DO YOU WANNA RIDE OR DIE... from mediocre Las Vegas Korean BBQ. 

Gen is a personal favorite of mine. The first time I had it in SoCal it felt like a 12 gauge shotty. Korean BBQ could be this good AND affordable? I literally have spoken about it as if it was a religion to my friends. All hail $19.99 Korean BBQ ($14.99 for lunch) with an extensive menu and and quality cuts.

The interior is the most ""upscale"" Gen I've been to with its blue neon lights and the layout is efficient and spacious enough for any size parties. I believe there is 36 types of meat on the menu, you can order up to 4 items and all you can eat appetizers. Service may be a bit too attentive, last visit I had servers and managers table touching back to back within minutes of each other, but is too much service really a fault? Table with banchans were all set up before I sat down, doesn't sound like a bad thing to me!

What separates this Gen from the other's in California are the only cons. First there is NO rice paper. I love rice paper, and I know others do as well, but I was informed its not possible to carry because of Nevada law requiring it to be refrigerated and that causing it to not be appetizing to eat. They have tortillas as a substitute but its not a solution, definitely don't expect to be making Kogi's or Komex table side. There are a few missing items, notably steam egg and some other favorites. Call me crazy but I feel like some meats are thicker than they should be (brisket). 

Besides all of the above Gen Henderson still reigns supreme in the Las Vegas Area (even if its in Hendertucky).

[Let's start with the POSITIVES]:
* Food came out very quickly after the initial order (as in, immediately after the server completed our orders since she used an iPad - or some electronic device - to take our orders to then send to the kitchen). This was AWESOME!

* Meats were fresh & delicious

* Serving size was sufficient for each order 

* Beef tongue was the best, and we ordered it about 8 times (and I'm not exaggerating)


[Now on to the NEGATIVES - which could make or break the restaurant for me]:

* Macaron ice cream was $4 each, and they were just OK. Macarons were stale.

* Tables are not good for a large party w\/ kids (the max they can fit in the low booths is 6 people). Tall tables fit large parties better, but high chairs aren't allowed

* Initially, we were told by 2 hosts we can have a high chair at the tall tables. After waiting 40mins, we finally got seated, then another host said we can't have high chairs & removed them (which we understand can be a fire hazard, but we wish they told us this in the first place). My siblings then had to hold their children all night as we all ate\/cooked dinner

* Ambiance is very lounge-ish

* Pretty loud inside (like a lounge\/bar)

* They don't take reservations, and wait could take as long as 30mins - 1.5hrs

* The hosts didn't know how to pronounce Gen & they didn't know what it meant! We asked a couple other hosts, and we were shocked they didn't know the answers as well!


Sadly, I came here with my family of 10 hoping to have a great experience for my Dad's birthday: 7 adults, 1 toddler, 2 infants. I know they tried to accommodate us as best as they could, but the inability to seat all of us comfortably, and the miscommunication between the hosts & servers to us were quite disappointing.

It's a shame it's not as family friendly as we'd hope, and the servers had no knowledge about the restaurant name (nor did they have an interest to ask management for the answer). Their food is good and their prices are really reasonable compared to other AYCE Korean places, so I wish my review was more positive.

I know they're still new, but I only hope they'll make these improvements before it gets worse.",0,1,1

I have no complaints at all about the food.The reason for my 2 star is because of the service. I am all about customer service especially when I work in the same field. The ladies at the front was very welcoming to seat us. However our server Julian sucked. He did not look happy at all and it took him awhile to get our order. As soon as he came over, he rushed us to order our food  & seemed annoyed we were still looking st the menu. He forgot to get our drink order first before getting our food order. My boyfriend tried to talk to him but he was quick with getting our order then left. We had to keep asking other servers to get us refills on drinks or sides. He was gone for a long time and finally my boyfriend asked another server if Julian can place another order for us but he said he was on break.

She also lost her voice  & said she was getting over being sick, but still had a smile and had great customer service. Finally when we were about to leave and we see our server again Julian and my boyfriend gives him the check, he did not say thank you or anything. As we are heading out the door, he had the nerve to ask us if we would go on yelp and write a great review for him because the person with the most reviews would get a promotion.

However, when we were sat down we asked our horrible server Sam for water and if they had hot tea. The response he gave us, I've never heard in my life. He said that they didn't have hot tea because it was too hot outside. Now, is that how you inform customers that you don't have hot tea?! You refer to the weather?!?! & so I asked another waiter and she mention they weren't serving hot tea at the moment which sounds more professional then what the other waiter said. Anyways, the meat wasn't that great. Not the same quality as the one in LA. The servers were slow and they didn't even oil our pan until we asked them to. It was just disorganized. When it was time for us to pay the bill, 4 servers came to ask if we wanted our check and we mentioned that someone was already getting it for us. We didn't get our check after another 20 min and when it came they made a mistake on our bill and so we had to wait for another 10-15 min. I was so upset I wanted to speak with the manager.

Some people compare this GEN to the GEN in LA. However, it is a whole different thing. The ingredients prices are much higher than in LA. With $20 bucks to eat lots of choices of meat and other side dishes, you can't get it anywhere in Las Vegas. This place was a little mess at the beginning before its grand opening.

I have to say that the wait for place is awesome. They were able to seat 7 of us in 10 - 20 mins @630pm on a Friday night. Pretty impressive. 
Their sides, appetizers, and meats are delicious. I'm very pleased with their food and all the different varieties meats they have to offer. 
TIP: When ordering especially with a large group order in small increments. We did the mistake of ordering a lot and them bringing everything all at one time. Don't get me wrong. I love fast service but we were literally running out of space on our table. So that was little irritating. But after cooking a few meats as fast as we could we eventually made space. 
\/\/GEN has a time limit when dining. 2 hours. To most this is more than enough time to dine. But I find when we dine especially in a large group 2 hours fly by. So when we reached our 2 hour limit they had no problem letting us know. I was a bit upset because we were still ordering. However we were ordering alcohol. We ordered 3 pitchers of Sapporo and 3 bottles of sake and 2 other bottles of beer. So it wasn't like we were just sitting there doing nothing. So we had to rush with our last pitcher. 
\/\/One more thing that was a bit bothersome was that we had 3 different servers. Which was fine because it felt like if we asked anyone for anything they would gladly get it. But I just felt like if we were going to be served by someone else other than our server than maybe an introduction was of been nice instead of Eddie saying oh I'm taking over for Kevin now but I'm leaving so I'll come back and introduce your next server ... and he never did.

For the last year (and for the next 6 months only! I'm counting down the days!) I've been living and going to school in this area. All the Vegas Korean BBQ places are clear on the other side of town and I'm never usually in that area. Pretty much the only time I ate kbbq was when I went home to LA. So I'm really glad that one opened up here because it is going to be my default kbbq spot simply because of the proximity.

That being said, I am extremely familiar with Gen and have dined at multiple locations. It is honestly my default kbbq spot back home too since they have one in Torrance, CA and I don't have to drive all the way to Koreatown. Compared to the California locations I've tried, this place really isn't that great. It's okay for what it is, but it could be better.

One thing to keep in mind is that Gen is not your traditional kbbq restaurant. It is more Americanized\/modernized. This is reflected in the decor, which is very ""nightclub""-y. There are also no hood vents, as the ventilation system is under the table\/surrounding the grill. There are also no traditional staples of kbbq such as steamed egg and Korean pancake (which I love and wish Gen would offer). There are Americanized appetizers such as cajun fries. Actually, the appetizer thing is new to this location if I remember correctly. They do not offer rice paper at this location, and you can only order 4 meats\/apps at a time.

The service is pretty bad. I have been here 3 times so far and I've had to search for our waiter every time. It's too bad I don't remember the names of the waiters. The first one was the only slightly decent experience as he was on point with service up until the end, when it was time for us to get our bill and there was no one around for like 20 minutes. It really sucks to have finished all the meat you cooked, without being checked on by anyone, and wait for 10-15 minutes before someone finally shows up and asks if you want to order more meat. Bad service isn't really localized to the Henderson location though, it is a complaint I can make of most Gen locations in California. They really needs to implement the button system that traditional kbbq restaurants have.

The table ventilation system can be a big issue. I haven't had too many problems at this location with it, but the flame in the grill can and will go out, causing you to have to find someone to light it again. One time we went, the couple next to us had to have theirs relit 3 times within what was probably a 10 minute period. If that happened to me, I would be really annoyed.

The Gens in CA offer macaron ice cream sandwiches as a dessert (not as part of the menu, you go up to the little freezer by the host stand and pay for one there), but this one does not have that, which is really disappointing.

As for whether or not it's the best kbbq in Vegas, I can't really say. I do genuinely enjoy the meat and the marinade flavor. The spicy pork bulgogi is one of my favorite things of all time. However, this location serves much smaller portions than the California locations do, and I don't know why. It's not that big of a deal for me as I usually go to eat here with my boyfriend only, but considering the 4-at-a-time rule, if you're trying to eat here in a large group some of you won't get to eat. Or you'll all eat really teeny tiny portions, like one slice of brisket per person.

A final note to my unnecessarily long review, because this really rubbed me the wrong way...
The first two times I dined here, the waiter informed us of a promotion they were having for their grand opening. If you wrote a Yelp review on your phone before getting your bill and named your server, you would get your drinks on the house. I feel like this is SUPER SHADY. First off, I write too much (as evidenced by this very review) and I would feel way too pressured to do it while sitting at the table. I mean, do I just sit in the table occupying it after I'm done eating and write my review for 20 minutes? Or am I supposed to do it a quick one-sentence, five-star review like Gervin D.? Secondly, I wasn't told to put 5 stars, but if he was told to by his server, that's super uncool and shady. That actually makes me want to drop my review to 1 star. I'll think about it.",3,0,0

My visit today makes me not want to come back. When we first arrived we were quoted a 45 minute wait which turned to one hour which with how busy they were I understand. Secondly when we were sat I ordered alcoholic beverages which were never rung in. We had to ask someone about it and they placed it again. From the time we got sat to when we got our drinks was a good 15 minutes. We dropped a pair of chopsticks on the floor and asked to get new ones and never got them. Had to go to another table and get them myself. Finally the grand finale... Our fire went out and had our server try to turn it back on. After 10 failed attempts he finally said we needed to be sat at a new table. We said ok. The server came back and said sorry they had to seat another table and we had to wait. Uh.. I think common sense is to seat us first since we have been unconvinced and have the people that have been waiting wait for the next table. We decided just to ask for the check and leave. Not once did the manager walk over to us to apologize and just told the server to give us a 20 percent discount on check. Sure I probably could have gotten into it with the manager but decided just to leave and never come again. From what I saw the only people who were on it was the kitchen. Food sure was coming out fast but the rest of the restaurant was poor. Personally I don't recommend anyone to go there. But that's just my opinion.,2,1,1

The banchan (side dishes) are limited, but tasty. I liked the cucumber and potato salad, but don't like that they put cilantro in the shredded daikon.  The bulgogi chicken and bulgogi beef were good.  They don't freely give sesame oil, so if you're into that just ask and they'll get some for you. 
The entrance is out front outside the mall, facing south.

I feel service (food wise) has gone a little down hill, I've noticed now that this place is poppin, their meat portions they bring out are smaller. With it being busier, our parties are going through the smaller portions faster than they could replenish. 
The sides are also smaller, oh on top of that, I'm really sick of them constantly being out of certain items. Some of these items are not seasonal.  When has there ever been a shortage of potatoes?

The restaurant itself looks nice, modern, and clean. 
Sounds good? Yes that stuff is good. 
Now here's where it takes a turn. The service and the staff. Wow. I was looking around like this has to be a joke. I was referred here by my cousin who said hey you gotta try this place it's awesome. So I came in happy to eat here. I walk in and there are maybe 5 tables seated. There were 3 hostesses there and they greet me kind of like I was bothering them. I let them know how many were in my party since they didn't know how to ask. They said they needed to set up a table. We waited about 15 minutes and a crowd was now building up waiting. My wife and I started to joke with each other about how the hostesses looked like they were afraid to make eye contact with anyone waiting. There was even a moment that the 3 of them formed a circle looking at each other so they wouldn't have to look at anyone. 
Another 5 to 10 minutes went by and we were seated. The hostess starts with her presentation of the menu by asking if we have ever eaten Korean bbq. I said yes I'm actually Korean. She looks at me and it's like nothing registered in her brain except for her trying so hard to remember her script, and so she explains to us what Korean bbq is. 
The waitress comes up literally within 10 seconds and asks if we are ready to order. Lol. We actually haven't even had a chance to open the menu. I say could you give us just a second so we can review the menu. She comes back and so we order. I also order a beer and my wife ordered some type of mango drink. A lady comes back to the table with the wrong beer. So I send it back. Then she brings my wife's drink out and it tasted like warm jello. We got our food and were relieved that it was actually good. So we ate, and our waitress never once checked with us. I sat there waiting to try and get some more food and she never came back. I just figured oh well I guess we will go. I really couldn't take it anymore. I had to ask a busser how we pay. They went and got a hostess who didn't know how to work her pay machine for my card. She was waiting on printing a receipt after she had already clicked the no receipt button. Until I finally said I don't need a receipt it's ok. 
It's a cool place to try because the food is good. Just be prepared for the most disorganized service you have ever had and you should be alright. Set your service expectations to 0 and you won't be disappointed.

Their red wine pork belly is SO AMAZING!! Must try!! Smoked garlic is good too but the red wine... it's a must. I love pork belly now, way more than I used to love brisket. Which is a lot. I also recommend the Hawaiian steak I think it is..? It's some type of steak on the menu and it's so good. 

They offer tons of options for dinner, including various appetizers. One being a spicy fried chicken that had me spitting fire... and I love spicy food. That chicken was something else.

We arrived around five and was greeted by the hostess rolling her eyes at us. We weren't the only lucky ones that got those rolled eyes too, customers that came after us all got the same. We got sat down after five minutes which was pretty good after what just happened.  
First our server didn't want to be there and as far as we could tell the other waitress's near by had the same horrible attitude. They weren't happy and nobody smiled. But here you have an energetic family smiling and being positive until they bring out the food; it was a disappointment. The portions were like for my eight year old, we had to order like the max order over and over just to make something happen.  This place is the reverse of all you can eat (AYCE).  We weren't the only ones complaining about the servings. Then to top things up, we had to remind our waitress for our drinks, refills and napkins.  Then don't let me get started with the busser's; they were just running laps, passing tables with empty plates on them, I had to literally put the plates in front of his way for him to stop.  But they were all like this, this place is far from good.  I can't read anymore of these reviews from this place from people that don't know what real Korean BBQ AYCE is and the service. 
To end this horrible dining experience we were asked by our dopey depressed waitress if we were paying cash or credit? She waited until I gave her a response; to eventually have a rude cashier come up to us with a tablet asking me for my CC. I had to double check she actually worked there because she didn't introduced herself or let us know she was going to take care of our bill at our table.

I had a friend growing up that we dined on this style of cooking at the dinner table and it was AMAZING. I was really excited to share this with my husband as something different and what I hoped would be as great as what I had as a teen. 

Umm yeah. Our first server was terrible. At the beginning, I asked how it worked (since we had not been here before) and she didn't explain anything other than it is all you can eat, but make sure you read the clauses at the bottom of the page on the menu. Didn't explain the 4 random dishes sitting on the table already, how it works, etc. Whatever. I asked for soy for my hubby, and she looked at me like I was insane. SOY? WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY??? What Kind of establishment do you think we run here? You have some, well you have a sauce, that isn't soy, it's slightly sweeter, but there ya go. Fortunately, we were taken over by a new server after our initial order. We did manage to get some soy too. 

Food- It was sad. Maybe we hit an off day, or maybe it just is crap, but the quality is nothing. The pre-cooked things were all either overcooked, hard, or stale. Nothing was fresh. Nothing. Second note, if you get the marinated shrimp, ask them if there is a technique to get the shells and heads off without totally getting it everywhere. I had no such luck and had so much gunk all over my hands trying to get it apart. UGH. There was no flavor to anything. It just had no redeeming quality, aside from our second server, the bussers, and cooktop swapper were all incredible friendly and nice. We tried almost everything, and I can't say I would try any of it again. 2 stars just because it is all you can eat (again, read the clause on the menu....and note they have cameras on the facility...in case you were thinking of slipping some chewing calamari or cow tongue in your purse to avoid being charged extra for it) , service was nice, and the process is fun.

First the waiter asked how old is my baby and I told him he is two and he gave me the look as if he didn't trust my word for it. He asked me once more and I gave the same answer. 

After we all sat down, my son started to have a bloody nose, and I asked for extra napkins to attempt to stop the bleeding, but they took their time and said please use the restroom because he was bleeding too much. I didn't say anything and did as they asked. After coming out from the restroom, took my son to the car to let him rest up with his mom. I went back to let the group to start ordering the meat without my wife and I. I assumed that the Gen in Orange County had great service before and will be able to accommodate my group without me, but they provided terrible service. The grill wasn't changed not till upon request. We ordered veggies but they took their time bringing it out.

After the group ate for about 30 minutes, since everyone was concerned for my son, I asked for the bill so that we come back to the hotel, and they charged is for 10 people!! I was shocked since my wife was out in the car and she didn't even get to sit to dine. I asked them why they charged for 10 rather than 9 since my wife didn't even had a bite to eat, their initial response was unfortunately you told us 10 adults and 1 baby they have to charge. I asked but she didn't even eat anything or even touch her plate, she used the restroom to tend to my son and left to the car right away. They then said that once she comes inside the store they will charge. I asked to speak with a manager, and she said the samething. 

Worse experience at Gen ever!!",4,1,1

We were seated within 10 minutes, which is unusual for a Korean BBQ place since it usually takes much longer. After being seated, we were informed of all of the menu items we were able to order. The menu, especially for the price, is a lot more that what we were expecting, ranging from beef briskets to marinated squid. All of this, of course, is all you can eat (AYCE).

After going through 5 orders, I already knew that this place was going to be a favorite of mine. The meats were delicious, and unlike some of the KBBQ places I've been too, the quality seemed excellent as well. The portions that were brought out at one time did not seem as large as other places, but since it is AYCE, this problem is alleviated. The servers were very attentive and came to us frequently, and waiting for the next batch didn't take an eternity. The appetizers and side dishes are very much appreciated and delicious, and I feel that the atmosphere was excellent.

The reason why I gave such a low rating beforehand was because of how the service was and how the servers were completely confused and not communicating with one another. 

The food was better this time. The portions of the appetizers now, especially the popcorn shrimp was a lot more than how it was before. The meats had more flavor this time and the service, even though it was busy, was much better.

I was fairly hesitant to come back to this place after hearing more negative comments about it. But I'm actually completely happy I went back because I'm definitely not down to drive too far again for some good Korean bbq.

I had the lunch special for $15 bucks even though I wanted to order the dinner cause I love the tongue but I was pleasantly pleased and the army of hungry people trying it for the first time loved it as well!!! 

Jaenica (I think that's her name) was an excellent server and very friendly and serviced us well especially me haha. 

Will come back again but probably only when I'm in Henderson. This place is out there in like the boondocks

Ok now that I had time to digest the slaughter, let's take a look at this subjectively..

Tofu hut is 14 for late night and 18 for reg. sura is like 23. sura is the worst. I would not go back on my own accord. Very small selection and unappetizing presentation. Tofu hut is limited but convenient and had beef tongue which is my favorite. But tofu hut is busy, very greasy, and I leave there smelling like Korean BBQ...


Now to Gen. I was super Impressed. I wanted to order the dinner for lunch and pay 20 bucks but the people I was with didn't want that. The lunch special for 15 bucks is amazing value. 

For starters their pan chan (side dishes) was great. Also all appetizers were included in the ayce price and included miso soup, sesame chicken (more like a karaage chicken), popcorn shrimp, and pork cutlet, gyoza, and many more. Already I was impressed with this. 

Now on to the meats!!! Many different meat selections, a few chicken choices which is rare cause most Korean BBQ has only one. The #1 item on their list is actually a whole steak. We ordered 3 of those. They had 3 different kinds of bulgogi. Not my favorite in general but it kept my white man friends happy which is good. 

Also the grill was designed like a gyukaku or Japanese style BBQ where the it was below the table a bit and holes around the grill sucked up the smoke so the restaurant was not smokey at all and your clothes are smelling like clothes still and not like ur slaving away in the kitchen. 

Now the service. I had an Asian guy come up to help us 3-4 times, a one republic boy band waiter help us 3-4 times, and also jaenica who was super friendly and works three jobs come and help us about 4-5 times. So even though I like to talk to friends during this time and don't like to be bothered much, I felt the service for the general population as a whole would find this place outstanding. 

Cons-

This restaurant is in Henderson, Arizona almost next to Phoenix. And I wouldn't recommend going and expect to sit more than 5 people on one table. I would recommend 3-4 people or 5 people with two of the, being petite women. 

Other than that, A+ rating for value and gets the Michelin-Fuks 3star rating",3,9,3

I was honestly shocked at how bad some of the meat we were given was, a couple plates were about 75% fat and gristle, and the rest were much more fat than usual.  The supposedly premium dinner cuts were just as bad, if not worse, than the basic cuts.  Would not feed meat like this to my cats, let alone a human.  All of the beef dishes had a weird-bad taste to them that I couldn't tell if it was rotten or just poorly stored, and I was afraid I was going to be sick later (but I wasn't).  The crowd was quite low for a Saturday, big change from all the other times I've been here before.  This place is clear across town for me, and I would pass a lot of other kbbq places to go here, but no more.

The quality of the meat is always good too. The must-try item on the menu is the Red Wine Pork Belly and their Premium Steak. The appetizers I always get are the Spicy Rice Cakes and the Jap Chae--SOOOO GOOD. They have a new item on the menu, the Volcano Fried Chicken. WARNING: the Volcano Fried Chicken is spicy AF--make sure to order a small portion first to try it out because the spice WILL creep up on you. One thing I wasn't too excited about was the Spicy Baby Octopus, it just wasn't for me.

Make sure if there is a wait, don't just put your name down, but can also ask to put your # down for notification mins before table ready so you don't have to wait inside crowded if is busy. Plus the location is right outside galleria mall, so can always go next store check around while waiting! After we got sat down at the booth, few side dishes was already prepared for us on the table! Our server got here really quick and took out drink order first. Honestly I don't really remember the name cause the fact seems our table don't have a pacific server. But however after we got our drinks we were ready to order some meat to cook:) so many choices !! 32 dishes for dinner to choose from! I guess cause they just open and the servers haven't memorize the menu, so when I order by name , the server was asking\/confirming by number which I totally understand . Only can order ""4"" dish at a time which is not bad, so it prevent people from wasting food :) got our meat , start cooking, make sure when they put oil on top the pan, it enough, sometimes at first they didn't seem put enough . The meat was just juicy and delicious!! I love it, no need much flavor and every plate was great:) the steak comes with full piece too but can always cut to pieces. Basically on food over all was great, but only  reason I gave 4 star was on service (which I rather put 4 1\/2 star but there is no choice lol)  is not a big deal, and I understand just open and servers still new getting use to it, many of different servers come to our table check on us like every 10mins or so, is not bad checking up but was bit too much  , and their food comes out quick so if something you order took awhile they probably forgot and just got to remind them:) their air suctioning fan right on the side of where you cooking very nice and simple! I recommend order some slice radish piece if you like to wrap small piece meat and eat it, balance the flavor and more appetite. Also there is some disharmony they only have for dinner menu. Will defiantly come back again! Hope to see you all soon!

Pros: *location *design *food *menu choices *price defiantly ( L. $14.99 D. $19.99) 
Cons: Nothing major:)",2,1,1

All you can eat meat, 
What can I say?
Priced just right, 
takes my breath away. 

I first tried Gen in October this year,
It's all you can eat, 
so it's quality I fear.

No fear no more,
The food is just good.
I came back multiple times,
like I knew I would. 

As for the meats,
So, here's my take.
The Signature's my favorite,
it's their premium steak

The beef bulgogi is dry,
the Chadol's too thin.
The KFC is a winner,
but the Signature still wins.  

I'm a fan of meat,
The service is great.
Are they the best KBBQ?  
Now that's the debate.

3 stars they earned,
Qualities' okay.
I would give more stars,
But wasn't blown away.

So, who's my favorite?
Does it really matter? 
Just keep the food coming,
with meat on my platter.

I've been here for dinner,
and even for lunch.
I will come back,
for that protein punch. 

So who am I?
A Yelper with rhymes on the loose,
Call me Mel C,
Not Yelp's Doctor Seuss.

Havnt been back in awhile because I live all the way on the other side of town but decided to eat tonight. I loved that this place has a lot of different appetizers and sides to choose from but THEY CHANGED THEIR MENU!!! Their banchan is so pathetically small too. U can finish it in one bite and constantly have to ask for more sides. They should just give a bigger portion of banchan so they're not always running back and forth to get the sides on the table. I went thru about 5-6 plates of kimchi sides and 7 potato salads and it was just my BF and I. 

Onto the meat-
Ordered the brisket because that's my favorite to eat. Its ok. The galbi used to be good and tender as well but this time it was so chewy I couldn't even swallow it. Smoked garlic pork belly was good though.

A couple eating next to us ordered a meat that I wasn't sure what it was so I asked a waiter and he told me its roast beef. So I said okay I want to try it and when it came out it was totally different than the plate next to us but they just said its a ""different"" cut. Idk.

Overall, I am disappointed and will not be returning. I'll stick to eating $13.99 tofu hut because it's WAY better than gen and bang for your buck. 

Side note: the table next to us ordered an iced sweetened green tea and when they recieved it , there was no ice and it was not sweet. Lol weird",0,3,0

I've only been to Korean bbq one other time at Shilla BBQ here in Vegas, and it closed down.  It was really gross and dirty so with that being my only experience to compare it to, this place was very good to me.  
I got the AYCE menu and a coke and my total was $28.47 with tax and tip.  I didn't realize that dinner prices apply all day on Saturday and Sunday.  
___________\\\\Things I liked:\/\/\/\/ 
-The waitress did not get judge-y when we ordered a ton of stuff. 
-The meat was super fresh. 
-The salad was really tasty. 
-Their rice was really good and sticky. 
-Server was very attentive and brought refills and asked if we wanted more meat. 
-Food came out really quickly.
-Huge variety of meats.  
-The decor is beautiful.  
-The baby octopus are HUGE.  I was expecting the tiny ones like some chinese buffets have but these were like the size of my hand.  
-Spicy rice cakes are wonderful.  I like them grilled. 
___________\\\\Things I didn't like:\/\/\/\/
-There was a huge spiderweb in the corner.  Didn't this place just open? 
-The potato salad was gross.  Imagine cold mashed potatoes with pickles in it. Blech.  
-We had to ask for rice.  
-Banchan was sitting on all the tables prior to seating people.  I found that pretty gross.  What if flies landed on it, or worse, some kid comes by and sneezes on it??  Ewww.  
-I asked for rice paper and was brought some chewed up sheets that wouldn't even stay together.  I think they were old or something. 
-No macaron ice cream sandwiches like the other GEN locations.  BOO!!!
-They were out of french fries and mac & cheese.  (like the only 2 things for kids)",12,8,7

But unfortunately, I think it should be a soft opening since they didn't have a lot of items on the menu. 

My body was so ready to dine at a decent kbbq in Vegas since there are really none worth mentioning around here\/worth the price lol.

I was taken by surprise with the items that they had because they had Cajun fries!!!!!!!!! But of course, they didn't have it :-( They also didn't have gyoza, tofu, or any teas. 

Meats are ok, but to me... the Cali locations taste a lot better. I love love love the garlic pork belly, but for some reason it just had a weird after taste lol. Brisket was pretty dry as well, even when we tried to cook it medium. 

What I did like was that they serve Japchae in big portions!!!! My fav. The KFC Chicken was pretty good too, a little too saucy, but still good. 

The service is A1, they try their best. 

I've been to two of the locations in Cali & this one just disappointed me a little. But I hope the employees don't get discouraged because you are all doing the best you can & I see the hard work you all are putting in :-) Customers should understand that it's the grand opening and should be a little nicer to the workers for things they have no control of!

 I know this place will do well though because there aren't many kbbq places in Vegas and Gen is pretty well known.

Walking in, I already had a biased opinion formed due to my terrible experience at their TUSTIN location. I can't say I had a better experience this time around either. 
I understand this is a pretty new location but the kids all seemed young an inexperienced. 
They also need to step up their banchan portion game! This was also an issue at the Tustin location. I asked for extra kimchi. They bring the little thing with TWO pieces in it. TWO! I was like Oh gee. Can I have a BIG BOWL of kimchi please, perhaps with MORE than TWO pieces in it? Thaaaaanks! I mean, seriously. Wtf. Banchan + Korean BBQ go hand in hand! Especially kimchi! What the damn hell! Besides, the more I ask you for something, the more annoying it is for BOTH of us. I am an unhappy guest with no kimchi and you are an unhappy employee who had to keep going back and forth to bring me said kimchi! How bout just a niiiiice portion size to keep your guests satisfied??
They have little banchan anyway, meaning not much variety, as well as TINY portions. 
They didn't have rice paper.
They didn't automatically give you garlic and jalapeños. 
They do have appetizers you can order which is different and they also have some lunch box options which is nice too. That's about the only positive thing i can say. Oh and thank you RICHARD for changing our charred grill. Even tho we were pretty much done eating it was still nice of him! 
We only had the beef brisket, premium pork belly and spicy pork. It was all pretty MEH.

They have not disappointed me. Although I think Tofu Hut is so much better (but thats just my opinion). They have good brisket, but how can you go wrong with brisket? Its not seasoned anyway lol. The main thing I dont like about this place is the dipping they give. Its some type of sea salt with green tea leaves or something Idk but I didn't like it so I asked if they had salt and pepper with sesame oil and they did but again it was sea salt which can be too salty. The meat options are over whelming and their kalbi was not that greatly marinated. the steak was horrible. very dry and unseasoned. The pork belly was good, but again like the brisket, you cant really go wrong with it, its not seasoned. I did like how they often changed the grill out for you when it became dirty. Another reason why I rate this place 4 stars is because of the shrimp that they offer on the menu and the squid legs I believe they have as well. My boy friend orders those two things endlessly.

My boyfriend come here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes more and we have always had a pleasant experience.

But this time we left extremely dissatisfied and disgusted.

When we first walked in our shoes stuck to the ground because it was so sticky. Which we ignored because maybe someone spilt a drink, no big deal.
Than we arrived at our table..
It looked clean but the second we sat down we felt a weird film over the seats and our hands covered in what we assume was grease on the table.
We immediately informed the lady that seated us... instead of having someone come over and actually wipe down the table she hands us more napkins...
Really? I didn't realize the people eating and paying also need to clean your mess.

So we waited until our waiter got to us and informed her, she was kind enough to offer to have our tables switched which of course we politely accepted.

Than we were faced with other problems.
-The grill wouldn't get hot even after we asked her to turn it up
-The scissors weren't sharp enough to cut the food
-The waiter was no where to be found when we needed her
-The food quality was very poor, weird textures, slimy consistency with the KFC which comes fully cooked.
-Waited 15-30 minutes to pay our bill. 
We could have walked out with out paying and no one would have noticed, that's how bad it was.


Like I said, we came here quite frequently at different times of the day and have NEVER had a problem like this. Tonight was just one disappointment after the other.

We will most likely not be returning to GEN and will be on the search for a new kbbq place.",3,5,2

When we got to the restaurant we were greeted & seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our server Ozzy was very helpful with the menu.

Even if it's a 27 minute drive from where I live, I wouldn't mind coming here on a weekly basis! I love this place mostly because of their friendly staff and their FOOD, duh! The interior design is a bonus.

I really don't know where to begin with this place. But let's start with location. It's right next door (literally, a 1 minute walking distance) to the Galleria Mall. They are usually packed on weekends and during the night time. So whenever I have to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, my party and I would look around the Galleria Mall to pass time. Along with the ease of reserving a table, they have an app you download that would notify you how many people are in front of you on the list, and tell you when your table is ready. Keep in mind that you can't reserve ahead of time via phone call, you can only reserve at the front check-in desk to have them write your name on the list.

Now back to getting seated. There are booths and high tables to sit at. The booths and tables are good for parties of 4-6? However, each both has only one grill, whereas the high tables have 2 grills for every 8 seats. The restaurant is still fairly new so of course everything is spankin' clean! 

I usually come here with parties of 4-8 so we order by the BULK, literally. Our favorite appetizers are the:

1. Fried Squid Legs
2. Japchae!
3. Sesame Chicken
4. Korean Fried Chicken
5. Seaweed Salad
6. Salad
7. Rice (a must lol)

and for meats we love getting:
1. Marinated Prime Rib (#10)
2. Brisket
3. Pork Belly
4. Bulgogi
5. Spicy Chicken

The quality of the food tastes better\/fresher than other AYCE KBBQ places I've been to in Vegas. They have a large variety of food as well, making the price of lunch ($14.95) and dinner ($19.95) all the more WORTH IT. And I'm glad I don't leave feeling gross and smelly like how I do at Tofu Hut or Haro. They have a bar and happy hour as well, but unfortunately I have yet to partake in that experience ): The ambience is trendy and classy since the lighting is dimmed. Don't worry you can still see your food and company still!

The customer service is great overtime I come here. No matter how busy or understaffed they seem, it is always quick and personable. We get our grill changed accordingly and have no problems with the workers.

I truly recommend this place if you're looking for an AYCE KBBQ place. The distance might be a deal breaker but it's no problem for me. Thank you for opening in Nevada Gen KBBQ!",11,7,13

Allowed some time to do some quick mall browsing. The 45 min estimated wait time was very accurate. 

The atmosphere is really nice and feels more like a high-end sushi or lounge type of environment. Definitely not the traditional Korean restaurant look. But the vibe was vibrant, active, and seemed fun. Couple big screen TVs that were airing sports. Seemed more geared towards the younger crowd and families. Decent alcohol selection.

We were seated at the bar. As someone who prefers more privacy when dining, I didn't like it at first, but found that it was a great spot to be seated at since it was easy to flag someone down or have servers continually stop by for orders. Our grill went out several times, but finally someone devised a way to keep the air flow going. I liked that the grill was set down into the table, which helped keep any grease splatters to a minimum.

Highlights:
#10 Marinated premium steak - very tender, and was our top meat choice
Salad
Side dishes - I loved all their kimchis. The cabbage, radish, and cucumber. Just the right amount of fermentation for my tastes.

Average:
#17 Smoked garlic pork belly - came with the rind, and was flavorful but a bit too much of a smoked flavor
Brisket - used to smaller pieces, and every piece had quite a bit of fat on it
Cajun shrimp
Fried squid legs - crispy
Fried spicy rice cake - I love rice cake so naturally I loved that this was offered. However don't expect the 'spicy' sauce to be in any way similar to ddukbokki (Korean spicy rice cake). It was more of a sweet chili sauce. 

Didn't enjoy:
Seaweed salad - Seemed frozen, and one of the ingredients in it was overpowering in a bad way

Wanted to try popcorn shrimp, but we were told that they had sold out of it. 

Have to ask for rice, sesame oil, soybean paste, garlic\/jalapenos.

Let downs: No Korean boricha barley tea, no gochujang (red pepper paste), no soybean or tofu soup, no steamed egg, no rice papers. No desserts (afaik)

Service was prompt and empty plates were taken away efficiently. Unfortunately we forgot to catch everyone's names, but we were helped by several servers who were all friendly and eager to help.  This isn't one of those BBQ places where the server comes by and helps you cook your meats. (Never realized there's people out there who expect the server to cook all your meats for you!)

For $20 a person, Gen Korean BBQ is an awesome deal. Even with a generous tip, it's still cheaper than most other places. What sets this place apart from other Korean BBQ places in Vegas are the atmosphere, service, and much wider menu selection. Definitely a good one to add to the rotation if you're a KBBQ fan.",1,0,0

Gen is a franchise I first tried in CA. Atmosphere is consistent, but Vegas menu is different and appears catered more towards an American palate. 

The (raw meat) portions are served smaller; let's call it a single person serving. No complaints about this approach (just a heads up). Quality of meat appears of ""better than average"" (for now, at least). Large selection of meats as well as a good selection of appetizers. 

An ""A"" for effort on service, but they've plenty of room for improvement. Long periods of waiting for the next order, bringing the wrong things, and having to remind the server about the orders. Staff does not mind their P's & Q's, which isn't a deal breaker, but leaves a lasting impression when a tray of raw meat darts past your face without so much as an ""excuse me"". 

Overall, I recommend Gen to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ. Not your standard creature comforts, but a good meal nonetheless.",3,0,0

There really is no waiting in Vegas\/Henderson unlike in SoCal and in the Bay Area.
Gen is still my all time favorite AYCE KBBQ (Although K-Elements in San Francisco may soon top that), and prices are damn cheap!
Servers are friendly, décor is nice, has a very hip feel to the establishment.
Banchan comes out as you're seated, and they have a very good salad dressing. They haven't done this before at any of my previous visits to any Gen locations, but they now have a Japchae ready from the start, so I don't have to order it.
Soft tofu soup has gotten a lot better compared to the last several times I have ordered it. It actually has some flavor now.
Most meat seems to be pretty decent quality, and flavorful. They have a huge selection of meats!
I have tried the appetizers on occasion too, but I think you can pass for the most part.
The thing that puts everything together is definitely the sesame oil dip\/sauce. I don't know what they do differently from other KBBQ places, but this one has a little bit of sweetness and saltiness that works with all of their meats.
Prime steak is nice and juicy, kalbi is good but wish they brought out more on one plate. Most of their pork belly taste the same to me.
They have the down draft system here, so your clothes won't smell like crap after and you can still go out!
I know Sura BBQ is in Chinatown and the kalbi is pretty good too, but I'd rather not smell like charred food after I eat.
At $20.99 for dinner, I'll be coming to the Gen in Henderson when I'm around and avoid the 2hr long waits that I have in the Bay Area.",1,0,0

Location: At the mall. Plenty of parking (parking lot). Easy access and easy to find.

Food: Beef tongue and the beef short plate was really good today. Brisket was so-so and it may be due to the flavor? We aren't sure on the reason why on that one. I wished they would give us more of the side dishes at one time so we don't have to keep asking for them.

On our first visit, service was terrible and it didn't seem like anyone knew what they were doing.

Their meats don't taste as good and their steak doesn't have a nice fatty rind like I've had in Cali. 

One good thing about this location is that they offer to change your grill top fairly often which is nice. It's also a little weird if you want to pay with a credit\/debit card because they send a manager to your table with a tablet to run it instead of taking it to the register...just seems a little unnecessary but works I guess

I've been to a couple of Gens back in California and I have to say this place was just alright compared to back home. Then again, I suppose this place would be a better alternative to having no nearby KBBQ places at all lol. The place has that club-like feel with the dimness and blue lights. It actually makes you feel like you should dress up a bit, but who does that for KBBQ? 

Anyways, it was cool to find out that they had a variety of appetizers which are included in the $19.95 AYCE dinner price. I tried the agadashi tofu and seaweed salad. The tofu was just alright. It could have used more seasoning and it'd be nice if it was crispier. The shell was so thin and didn't have that crunchiness factor. I'd rather just eat the tofu without the shell since it would be healthier lol. The seaweed salad was decent and a nice addition to the meal since it was refreshing and doesn't really fill you up (more room for meat!). 

As for the meats, I would not order their brisket. It literally was the most fatty pieces of meat I have ever seen and eaten. It seemed okay at first, but after cooking them on the grill for a few minutes, the fat began to puff up and the meat resembled marshmallows. I think there was more fat than meat and my poor arteries cried with each bite I took. Besides, that experience, the rest of the meat was okay. The bulgolgi I've had at other places were much saucier and flavorful while this place seemed much drier and tasteless. Their steak is good and I would recommend trying their K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken). It looks like the orange chicken you can get at Panda Express, but the sauce definitely makes it worth it. 

The side dishes were typical, but I was sad that they didn't have the thin slices of radishes. The sourness definitely makes the meal much more enjoyable. 

The service was actually pretty good. There were people coming about every 10-15 minutes just to check up on my table. They were nice and had a good upbeat attitude which makes a big difference because I've been to some places where you can tell that the workers did not want to be there.

On our recent trip to LV, we took the in-laws out of their comfort zone and into Henderson for this AYCE Korean BBQ.  These are just a few reasons why Gen Korean BBQ gets five stars:

-Friendly staff: If you don't know what something is, ask and surely they will tell you.  Also, they are happy to provide suggestions based on your likes and dislikes
-Good quality meats.  No nasty cuts.
-Fast service.  Some yakiniku spots have you waiting DAYS for raw meat.  Not here!
-Efficient.  Once we were ready for our check, the host came around with an ipad, swiped our card and printed our receipt.  Painless!
-Yummy Korean food.  Good dobbokki, especially in LV is hard to find.  They stay true to Korean specialties while making it accessible to everyone.  Even my in-laws who are kind of picky, LOVED this place.  My FIL kept asking ""what's the catch?!"" in disbelief!

Best part is that a new one just opened in Hawaii.  Once the hype dies down and the wait isn't three hours, I'll be there!",4,2,4

The restaurant is located in front of the Galleria Mall, which is convenient because unlike other Korean BBQ places, you don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown and deal with the hassle of finding parking. The place had a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I did the AYCE and thought the food was just ok. I wish they had more sauces available because the only dipping sauce they provided was a bit too salty. I really didn't like their grills. Everything I cooked stuck to it, and the servers had to change our grill about 7 times because it kept turning black from all the burnt residue. Another thing I really didn't like was having to pay at our table. The server came to the table with their iPad and stood there the entire time to run my payment. It just made things REALLY awkward.

I have never heard of this place and so I didn't have any expectations, but they did make a good first impression. Before entering the restaurant, there's a menu for you to look at. There's was so many things I wanted to try! We haven't gotten a table yet and already I'm craving me some KBBQ.

Atmosphere:
Upon entering the Gen, the first thing you see is how the interior is decorated. The design is modern. It is definitely decorated a lot better then most of the other KBBQ places I have been to in Vegas. It's a plus, but I didn't come here for the decorations, I came for the food!

Food:
They have a big menu and I was really excited to try a lot of the stuff on the menu. My boyfriend and I already knew what we wanted to order. One of the cons was that some of the items that we wanted wasn't avaliable, such as the Cajun fries and the hot tea. Still, there's a lot of things for us to try, so it wasn't a big deal. The food came in small portions. It allows me to try more stuff before I can't eat anymore. Some items were better than other. I didn't expected everything to taste great, but overall most of the items were pretty good.
Noteworthy items includes: Spicy Chicken, Red Wine Samgyubsal, and the Gen Pork Bulgogi

Service:
The service started off really great. Our drinks came quickly and our first order of food came out really quickly as well. At one point we noticed that our food wasn't cooking because the food wasn't on, but our server, Lisa, got that fixed really quickly. As the night went on, the service fluctuated. Most of the time we would get our food quickly, but there were a few instances where we had to wait a long time for our food to come out. Sometimes, the food runner would bring over food that we never ordered or bring us food that we have already ordered.

Miscellaneous:
Another thing that I want to bring up is that their venting system is AWESOME. One of the things that bothers me about KBBQ is that I always leave with that KBBQ smokey smell and it stinks up my car for a week. But not this time, I was spared the stink.

Overall:
I would eat here again. I wasn't expecting the best food ever, considering it was $19.99 for AYCE, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. The food is comparable (or even a little bit better) to some of the well-known KBBQ places in Vegas. I wasn't expecting the greatest service ever, considering that they have only opened for a few days when I ate there, therefore I was very lenient with the service.",0,0,0

Friday night and GEEZ it was packed! Expect a bit of a wait, but nothing horribly unreasonable. Probably took up around 30-minutes, during rush hour. You should get here earlier if you want to beat the crowd. They don't do reservations, so by the time we were seated, I was starving. It's $20 all-you-can-eat so it was a total steal compared to places like Sura, Honey Pig etc.

We had the smoked garlic pork belly, galbisal(?), beef tongue, and garlic calamari several times. I think I found religion. THIS must have been what heaven tasted like. The pork belly melted in my mouth. Although I felt like my party overcooked it a bit, our server (Terry I think his name was), helped us out. Most of my coworkers never had KBBQ before and when I wasn't paying attention, they seared it on their side of the grill for a little too long! It was perfect the second time around. Salty, well-seasoned enough to give you a heart attack. Glad our server paid attention heh. Coworkers were kinda hopeless haha. I mean, how hard is it to cook meat right?!

The kalbi was AMAZING. Thick, marbled meat that sizzled beautifully on the grill, it tasted fresh. My best friend (korean), is pretty critical of KBBQ joints and this, by far, blew her expectations out of the water! I can normally tell when she doesn't say anything and slightly nods and doesn't criticize the food. I was kind of shocked because she absolutely dislikes going out to eat korean foods that fall short of her expectations. Her number one complaint is usually freshness and Gen, she admitted, was pretty damn good. FINALLY, she and I can agree on something.

We had a couple waiters tend to us, but Terry stood out by doing a good job of refilling our drinks (I drink water like it's alcohol) and keeping an eye on my companions when they were stubbornly cooking the meats themselves. 

Decor is very stylish and modern. Fits right in with Galleria. I like the open-air floor plan. Whatever ventilation system they have, it was way better than the other Gen I went to in Cali. My clothes didn't stink of pungent meats, which is a refreshing change. My friend complained a bit about that lol.

For the price, the quality is unparalleled. It's about $15 AYCE for lunch! Even better! I'll have to bring my other friends here next time!",4,3,4

My husband and I are approaching 40 visits to this restaurant and we still intend to come back every Sunday for brunch.  Of course, this Sunday was father's day so we arrived expecting to wait a long time for a table.  This place is PACKED almost every day of the week but especially on holidays - it's worth the wait and everyone knows it.  Surprisingly, we were seated much faster than we had expected!

We had Jaenica (I know I'm spelling that wrong, and I apologize) for a server and she was great.  I think we've only ever had her once before but she still had our usual order memorized.  There was a minor mix-up in the kitchen and we ended up with 3 orders of roast beef instead of 2 orders of roast beef and an order of pork belly but when Shae arrived to deliver the food and we mentioned it to her she hurried back to the kitchen and returned with the pork belly in no time at all.  Our meal was perfect, as always, and we had a great time.

I will say I am a little bummed to see the seaweed salad is no longer on the menu and if there is any way to bring it back I would be thrilled!  That said, putting cheese in the pork cutlet was pure GENius and made an already delicious appetizer even better!

See you all again next Sunday!",3,3,3

So make sure you ask for him, he was hustling and bustling and ensuring that we were happy as well as his other customers. 

I'm definitely picky when it comes to food, so make sure you try this place out. My favorite dish was the Gen Beef Bulgogi (sweet one) and their side appetizers of different kimchi. The disappointment was that there were no short ribs with the bone, but if you like it without the bone then you've come to the right place. This was my first and definitely not last time to dine here. 

Last note, it's hard to find this place if your looking at the galleria mall map. So the best way to get here is to go up the escalator to the second level next to Larsen's at the main entrance area before you enter into the mall.

To start off, the restaurant looked very clean and modern. There were plenty of seats and the vents did a great job at keeping the place smoke free and not smelling like a grill. Although it is a big restaurant, you would have to wait for a little bit since this place is plenty popular already. 

At first, most of the staff members were very attentive. We were greeted once we entered and put on wait-list. Once we got to our seats, our server, Yuhao, did a great job at explaining how ordering food works, any drinks to start off with and what was or was not available for the day. Yuhao did a fantastic job at serving me and my friends. He constantly checked up on us and refilled our water.

The food served here is great. My favorite dishes were the brisket and KFC chicken. They have the best brisket ever! It was very nice to find a Korean BBQ place that served unlimited appetizers. A lot of their appetizers were good, especially the popcorn chicken. My friends and I also tried a lot of their meats that contained the ""thumbs up"" sign but found that a lot of them were not that great. The smoked garlic pork belly tasted like bacon and the red wine marinated pork belly tasted like Chinese sausage. I was very excited for the garlic chicken but was disappointed when it tasted like grilled chicken with nacho cheese. Besides those three, all of the other dishes were delicious and had a lot of flavor to them. 

However, toward the middle of our meal, we noticed that our great service was dying. In the end, it seemed that our server was off the clock and new servers clocked in. This is where the customer service went from 10 to 0. None of the new servers ever bothered checking up on us. We wanted to order more food but it was almost impossible to get someone's attention even though my friends and I were constantly staring at any staff walking past our table. After two tries of trying to get someone's attention, I had to wave my hand and give the server the ""come here"" gesture for him to come to the table. My friend decided to order another appetizer but after waiting for over 15 minutes, he never got the food. We decided to just ask for the check and leave. 

Overall, I would come back here because the restaurant has a lot of space and I love their appetizers and meat. $20 for unlimited appetizers and BBQ during dinner is a bargain. They just need improvement on continuing to take care of their customers after the servers switch shift.",6,3,4

There are some appetizers that are part of the AYCE menu. Price per person depends on when you go: weekday vs weekend, lunch vs dinner. We've been here for lung during the week which is probably the best time to go because you avoid the ridiculous wait during the weekend AND it's only $15 per person.

The banchan was good. From the AYCE menu, we tried: brisket, bulgogi, garlic pork belly, signature steak, KFC, and jap chae. I liked everything especially the garlic pork belly. Yuuuum!!!

The thing I like the most about Gen is that each grill has its own vent. The smoke doesn't even get a chance to go up more than 2 inches - it gets sucked in right away so, you don't end up smelling like grilled meat!

Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich - it's not part of their AYCE menu but it is available. The flavors they have include coffee, vanilla, mango, green tea, etc. They're ok. The macaron shells are very dry and hard. The ice cream in the middle is icy. Skip this and just eat all the meat!",12,3,7

Every time before I entered, I looked at the menu displayed at the main entrance to see if Gen have the steaks that Gen serves during lunch time. I will see it displayed but when I am ordering with my family or friends the steak, even when the Restaurant just opened, the waitress will tell us , ""I am sorry we are out of the steak."" 
The problem is, the menu on the main entrance and the menu that they gave me and my family or friends did not say, ""out of stock on the steak."" The waitress waited until you start ordering. 
The other problem with Gen Restaurant about ordering steak, they always ""out of stock."" One time, we ordered 3 different menus and guess what, the waitress told me with my family, we are ""out of stock."" Imagine, 3 consecutive orders were ""out of stock.""
I was invited with my spouse back to Gen Restaurant by a friend. I told my friend that Gen Restaurant has this habit of ""out of stock"" on their menu. She told me that to give it another try and if it happens again, we will never go back to Gen Restaurant.
Guess what? There was no steak again, as usual response,""out of stock.""
For me, this is a pattern. Gen displays a ""False Advertisement "" to the public. I need to contact the agency that enforces the Consumers' Act because this is not the first time that this ""False Advertisement"" has happened.
For the readers, I used to work in a restaurant and I know what the things the owners in the restaurant are not supposed to do.
For the future customers, I wish you luck because by writing this article whether Gen Restaurant will take it constructively and have the menus always ""on stock"" or you will be the next VICTIM of ""out of stock.""
Lastly, for the new customers, be prepared to be embarrassed by Gen's waitress. Gen Restaurant is ""Eat All You Can"" but when you call the waitress to order, they tell you as a customer, ""You still have food on your plate."" I am the customer. Why comment that ""You still have food on your plate.""
Then again, future customers, good luck and enjoy your unwanted menu on your table Gen Restaurant because ""out of stock.",1,1,1

The brisket, fast cooking slices of beef is great, especially if you eat it with the salad like Ssam.
The bulgogi is tasty, but you need to order multiple orders, as the portions seemed too small for 2 to share.
The spicy pork, again was tasty, as was the Dakgogi (chicken).

I ordered 6 different meat dishes, a plate of fried calamari, and a plate of tofu so I had quite a bit to eat. My waiter, Seong (maybe Sung?) took my order and came to check up on me several times throughout the meal. He came often enough so I never ran out of food, but not so often to the point that I would feel bothered. During my first round of ordering food, I only ordered one dish but he suggested that I order one more dish since the dishes aren't full sized. That was a definite plus since that allows customers to try a lot of different things, then go back and just keep ordering whatever is best on the menu to their taste (Remember that this is a buffet so you're getting a great deal here). In short the service was excellent. I would say the top pick goes to any of the pork belly dishes and also the spicy squid dish. Both need were cooked at the table, taste great, and the pork belly is just the right thickness and doesn't burn.

It's new, clean, and modern looking. Relative to food, service, price, and decor I think Las Vegas has found a new bidder for best Korean BBQ joint. Highly recommended.",2,2,2

We couldn't fit at one table so they split us up with two booths next to each other which is fine. The decor is very spacious, modern, sleek, and with the blue neon lighting throughout the restaurant, it has a trendy, loungey feel to it. They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday. Since this restaurant is new and popular, we didn't want to wait an hour. We turned out to be right because people started coming in and they got busy with people waiting.

They charge the $19.99 dinner price for lunches on weekends. $14.99 for lunch on M-F. Dinner is $19.99 everyday. You can order four apps and meats at a time. The servings are small. Some people have complained about the portion size but I actually like it. That way, I can try more things and I tend to be a greedy KBBQ eater. I order too much sometimes. They were out of a few apps that day which I wanted to try. Out of the apps, I liked their sesame chicken the best. Their kimchi is really good too. I find that if I like the kimchi a restaurant serves, I usually end up liking the food as well.

We ordered beef brisket, Cajun shrimp, galbisal, miso pork belly, beef tongue, chicken bulgogi, and beef short rib plate. We repeated some of the orders. I like the galbisal the best. I liked the seasoning on the Cajun shrimp but it was too much work peeling the shrimp. I rarely get chicken because it takes too long to cook and I'd rather eat red meat. We only ordered it because my friend's kid likes chicken. 

We received VIP service. Our waters were constantly refilled, our grills were changed 6-7 times, got more banchan, and the servers checked up on us often. The cons: no gyeran jjim (steamed egg), doenjang chigae (fermented soybean soup) and no dduk bo ssam (rice wrappers). Also, I'm not a fan of their grills. They don't have an overhead hood system. The grill burned too quickly and it needed to be constantly changed. However, you don't leave with that terrible KBBQ smell on you so I like that part.

I haven't been to the CA location but looking at the pictures, their portions seem larger and they offer more items. I'll have to visit one of the CA locations to compare one of these days. Other than the lack of some KBBQ staples and the grill burning too quickly, it's a pretty good deal to satisfy your KBBQ fix. I felt so fat and satiated after.",10,9,10

My parents (in their 70's) and I arrived 4 minutes prior to opening (11am). The door was ajar so I asked employees if my parents could take a seat in the waiting area to avoid the heat as well as the soot in the air due to the California wildfires. We were denied. What made it worse was the Galleria mall parking which is the same for Gen, was already packed. Since there is no seating outside I figured it would be a waste of time to walk to the car to get the AC running cold and back to my parents to get in and sit. By the time it would take me to accomplish that, the restaurant would probably be open. So, I chose to take my parents to Sunset Station and with our Chairman status we were  inside and seated in AC with full plates in no time. Thanks Sunset Station! GEN you won't see me there again.

The server returned to the table 3 times and asked if we were doing ok and we kept having to remind him about the edemame. The worst is that they charged 18% gratuity for tables larger than six, I usually tip more but on this occasion the server was less than deserving of any gratuity at all.

Moving from California, my husband and I are tough customers. You see, mostly every kbbq at California have similarities in menu options but the quality of the meat is what matters the most for us. That's why you wouldn't catch us in any 9.99 spot in California anymore since we've experienced a handful of premium quality meats in the 19.99 or 25.99 spots or even worse, per plate! Eeks now that's pricey but delicious!

We went at around 4pm. The crowd was a good crowd. Wasn't too hectic. We were seated within 10 minutes of waiting with a group of 7 (two kids included) which are 9.99 four years and up. Gratuity is included in groups of 6 or more FYI. We had to remind them of the salads and jap cha noodles since you can notice that with so many side dishes available, they can't keep track of whats supposed to be handed out without question. Haha. We weren't offended at all. We already know wassup. Being a waiter\/waitress in hard enough, now imagine at an AYCE kbbq spot, that's almost suicide so  we have respect for them and try to be patient with no more than having to ask more than 2x of a 5-10 minute wait span. 

Their noodles are really! I've tasted a good amount of glass noodles where it either had too much onions and carrots and everything mixed it to ones that were hella peppered up and all you taste was pepper to ones that were overly oiled and flavored up. This is a winner for me! Light on everything topping and flavor wise. Brisket meat was on point. Good cut and good enough fats on it. We tried their house steak but wasn't my favorite. The gen at California had thicker cuts with better texture on each bite. We used to just ask for pepper and salt to season it before throwing it on the grill. The beef tongue was one of the best yet, I'm speaking for my husband at this point coz I don't eat beef tongue at all but he kept going and going and going on it. He asked for lemon on the side so he was really happy with that. The Cajun chicken was devoured by my mom. She expressed how much she liked the seasoning as well. The pork belly was delicious. The wine pork belly is good if you're into wine marinated meats. You will taste the wine I can promise you that. The Cajun shrimp was good. You don't get that ocean taste. The calamari was alright and squid was alright. We really missed the Hawaiian steak that the Gens offer at California. That was honestly one of my favorites dish selection over there. Salad was on point! I don't know about you but I am a salad girl. The dressing was perfect. The slices were perfect. I went on and on with that. I literally had more than 10 plates of their salad alone. Perfect spice. Their brisket sauce is good too. Not too strong and not too light. They will change you grill no matter how many times you ask! Also you're not stuck with one waiter\/waitress. Don't be shy to just ask anyone. They're all friendly and ready to serve you.

3 disappointing facts .. NO RICE PAPER, NO EGG POT and NO TOFU\/BEAN SOUP! I've talked to the manager about it and he said they will not get any rice paper, they will not get egg pot since they didn't offer that in Cali and I stated that the Gen in California, Cerritos was starting it since I was there before we left for Vegas. They will not get tofu or bean soup since they offer miso soup and honestly their miso soup is too strong and too salty and very plain. No green onions on it nor does it have an tofu in it at all. It's more like a a tofu soup pack that you just microwave at home -__- 

Overall, we're going back for the price and quality of their meats and side dishes. But very sad and upset that there's no rice paper and no tofu soup at least. The manager said he'll pass on my request and suggestions but I don't see it going that far unless we all team up and complain but then again, they're already winning with the price and quality they offer so I'm pretty sure people wouldn't give a damn in the end of rice paper or soup coz it's all about the meats anyway right?!

Macaroon ice cream sandwiches should just be illegal.

Service is good, BUT even though we told the server we had never been there before and needed a little advice...none was forthcoming.  

With a little trial and error we caught on to cooking times and technique.  The biggest problem was, at first, the grille was turned down really, really low so it took forever for anything to cook.   Another table noticed our frustration and suggested we tell the bus person who immediately figured out the problem.  After that is was pretty smooth sailing. 

The only reason the trip to Gen doesn't get five stars is the lack of instructions re: the cooking time issue.  Okay, your thinking, ""How difficult is it to figure out how to cook chicken,  pork,  beef, etc?"" And right you are!   However, whole baby octopus, whole calamari?   A little less obvious!

We came here at 11:03 on a Monday night and we were turned away by the hostess. ""Sorry but we stop seating at 11."" That's fine, but it's not mentioned anywhere on the website or the menu and we were mere mins past 11pm. Is 3 mins really going to make that much of a difference? It seemed like a slow night, so I'm guessing the hostess cared more about getting to close early than taking our business. If they treat potential customers that way I can't imagine how poor their service is when you've already sat down and they know they already have your money. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Also from the pictures and reviews I've seen it seems like they put a lot more effort into their trendy ambiance than they do their food (only 4 banchan dishes at a kbbq? frozen meat?). This is subpar even for $20 AYCE. If you want QUALITY, authentic kbbq and good service you'll find much better driving 10-15 mins to Chinatown area. If you prefer trendy ambiance to an authentic experience and attentive staff then this is the place for you.",4,4,2

Minus the drinks and desert. There are also some other options that are for dinner only menu but if you pay a little more you can have it. The beef brisket and beef bulgogi are one of my top faves for all you can eat. The atmosphere for the restaurant is really modern and laid back.

We were seated way faster than the wait time they gave us. They took our order quickly and brought everything out pretty fast too. The food was good, but not amazing. The fact that it's all you can eat makes it a good reason to come back. My favorite was the boneless galbi. Most of the meats were tender, but they lacked a little flavor...maybe some more seasonings like sesame seed oil and sesame seeds would help and a sweeter more flavorful Korean BBQ sauce. There were several different waiters coming by our table making sure we didn't need anything, but we did have to ask a couple of times for a fork and to get more spicy cucumbers...but that might have been because of the number of people that were tending to us. Our main server, Kevin, was awesome!!! He made suggestions and had pretty good knowledge of everything on the menu. He was super polite and friendly too. If there was something he didn't know, he quickly went and found out. 
The atmosphere was good, even though they had people working on the bar and by the door. They had music playing, but not too loud, and when happy hour started, they all cheered and yelled out, ""It's happy hour!!!!""

service - definitely still quite the short-falling on this area. took quite the long while before our area's waiter came to our table. Waters were forgotten til probably after then 2nd round of ordering, even after a reminder. BUT after waiter took our first order, WOW the meat came out fast ! .................... that didnt last long.. it took forever for the orders later LOL dang it ! 

grill - noticed the venting wasnt as good as it was the first time i went. first time, i was super surprised how well they worked for the grill-side venting system. quite the bit of smoke escaped this time around. another note, not sure if it should be a blame or its just a common thing that happens... the ring of fire under the grill has a metal cap on top of it that helps evenly distribute the flame\/gas... tends to get hit when waiters\/whoever changes the grill. we tried to fix it a few times but still had trouble. it wasnt until the manager saw us struggling and came to fix it that it was fixed... up till then, we just had to keep rotating the grill to have the high\/low spots for things XD 

side dishes were definitely lacking. we had like... 3? maybe 4 diff items? wao o.O was it always this low? 

this time around, they had the rice paper o.O wonder what changed ... hopefully its within health district ruling @_@ still dont have my sliced daikon ""paper"" i like to wrap my meats with before eating. 

meats were the same. my uncles fav were the #1 signature steak and #2 pork jowl. #3 brisket was a bit on the leaner side this time. 

overall still a decent deal for $20. yeah kind of far but eh i dont eat kbbq that often anyway... so im ok with the drive Lol",3,2,0

Then when we sit they tell us that on the weekends it's dinner prices only, we were somewhat okay with that, just wish it would be publicized somewhere. So we are about to order and now our server proceeds to tell us they are are out of half their appetizers\/side dishes. If you want me to , pay full dinner price then don't be out of your supply, especially on a weekend; you need to be better prepared for a weekend and high demand! Not a first good impression! We were looking forward to a new restaurant at Galleria, don't think it will be an asset to the area unless they get their act together. Oh, and ALL hostesses (6) working at the front counter need nicer attitudes as they are the first person you meet when you walk in.  I think all you can eat sushi would be a better choice and money better spent.",1,0,0

Make sure to get there early - they do not take reservations. (And an FYI - they only do ""lunch"" pricing on the weekdays. Dinner pricing applies all day in the weekends).

For $15.99 (for lunch) on the weekdays or $19.99 for dinner, you get an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord of appetizers (they never have the fries - ever) and specialty meats and sides. You had better know how to use a grill, or else you may have a difficult time cooking your food here - you cook it - the staff does not.

The staff are polite and happy to explain how the place works. However - if you have leftover food, you will face additional charges to your bill for wasting it. I've never had that issue, but the warning is there. You also have only two hours - or else you will get charged for another dinner if you decide to sit around! The staff are quite busy here, and it seems to be quite disorganized. We waited for almost 20 minutes for refills on water. If your grill gets dirty (read: charred) they will happily change it for you though.

I suggest the brisket and the roast beef. The marinated meats (especially the chicken) are difficult to cook right and burn easily because of the sugars involved. The pickled radishes and mashed potatoes are good, too.

I would suggest this place for the price, and give it 4 stars, but -1 star for the madness of disorganization. Happy eating!",0,0,0

Our server was Eugene and he had probably the best customer service than anywhere I've ever been! He constantly made sure we had napkins, sesame oil, orders in, grills changed, and etc. basically his customer service totally made up for the host trying to put us in the horrible corner.

I didn't get really bad indigestion from eating here versus any other korean restaurant. The only thing that's possibly different is their sesame oil, it doesn't taste that great with my pork belly versus other places, and their spicy tofu soup lacks a bit of authenticity but other than that; they also have Cajun shrimps you can grill and a huge variety of meat selections I mean so it makes up for it.

My favorite was when we tried to order seconds and our grill burned for a good 10 minutes, drinks were empty, before she comes over and asks if we're done...?? Not to mention she lets us know after my other half complains that they are out of some of the meats we ordered.

After the next set of food arrives, everything shows up in 2s.... So, I ordered a good 6 dishes and she comes out with 12? I'm sorry but I never said 2 of everything and I certainly cannot eat all of that. Don't understand where her brain was.

There is a waiter who checks on you often and takes your ongoing orders, and another person who clears your table from the plates and changes your grill.

Food...well it's an AYCE dinner for $19.99 which is a heck of a bargain! From the 4 -5 variety of side dishes, rice paper and\/or radish paper, appetizer and meat variety...there is quite a selection. We loved the crispy squid legs from the appetizer menu, finding ourselves ordering it throughout the night. The miso pork belly, bulgogi, Cajun shrimp head on, and calamari were are choices which were all equally tasty.

Once we sat down, we were told prices were higher for President's Day (about $5 more), but we're already there so no big.  My cousin and her boyfriend ordered calamari and brisket and got their food pretty quick.  I ordered crispy sesame chicken, but what I wasn't told was that there would be a wait (at least 10 minutes).  I had some salad and rice to munch on, but it was annoying to have to be the one to remind our waiter about my food.  He'd come by asking if we were ok, and I'd have to tell him ""just waiting on my chicken.""   He would tell me it's frying, but he never said why it took so long.  I worked at a restaurant where we fried food, it would never take as long as this did.  

When it finally arrived, it definitely didn't look like the picture, just 5-6 pieces of shrunken fried bits.  Half of them actually had chicken in it, the other half were just pieces of fried skin.

I ordered Cajun chicken next, which came out pretty quick, though it was hard to taste the Cajun flavoring.  Then our waiter forgot my cousin's final order for more brisket.

Most of the food (minus the chicken) was actually decent once it came out and was cooked, and the presentation inside is neat, almost has a club like atmosphere, high end.  But service brought this experience down. If our waiter seemed friendlier, it might have not been as bad, but he just seemed like he was running through the motions for basic service.

Plus, for those who have never been to a restaurant like this, you cook your own food.  There's a skillet\/stove top in the middle of your table and you put your raw meat on there to cook.  Yes, it's unique, but you're paying them so you can cook your own food.  Sure they're providing the meat, but it might not be worth it to you.  In addition, you cannot leave any leftover meat or else they'll charge you and you have a two hour limit.  Now this is common with other All You Can Eat places (like sushi), but if you want to eat without restrictions on how much to eat and for how long, stick to somewhere else.

I've been to quite a few Korean BBQ restaurants and I would say that Gen is #1 when it comes to ambiance and cleanliness of the establishment. The food are served in nice looking plates. The only thing that is stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the fact that sometimes, it is extremely hard to get a table and they do not take reservations. Another is the fact that they don't have fish cakes, which is OKAY because what they're missing with the fish cakes, they make up for in their large selection of appetizers.

Upon arriving there was a wait of about 30-40 minutes, the hostess asked for our phone number and we were able to track through an app how many parties were ahead of us, and then we were texted once our table was ready.  About an hour later, longer than we were quoted, we received a text informing us that our table was ready.  We arrived to the host stand and there was still about a 15 minute wait and one party ahead of us.  Kind of disappointing.  

We were then sat at our table and noticed the menu on their website is a little different than the menu you get at your table. Also they don't even have everything on their menu.  The waitress informed us they only have 4 side dishes.  There were about 8 on the menu.  

As far as the menu went, they have a great variety of options ranging from edamame to intestines to brisket.  There is definitely something for everyone.  They have many menu options that a lot of local Korean BBQ places that are not even AYCE offer.

The food came out in a timely manner and the waitress was attentive to our drinks being empty and wanting more sides.  

The beef brisket was delicous.  I also loved the popcorn shrimp, the pickled cucumber side, and the yogurt soju!  

A few downsides - We were sat across from the entrance to the kitchen and just from a quick glance in the kitchen the floor was dirty and had a lot of debris.  A team member of theirs sneezed across from our table all over a counter and didn't cover his face.  In the bathroom when I reached for a paper towel probably about 15 paper towels came out.  

Overall, a wonderful experience.  I mean for $20 you truly can't beat it!  I will definitely be back!",3,2,2

I also bought a gift card here, and when my friend attempted to use it, the staff stated that the balance was $0. This was due to an incompetent staff member who incorrectly rang up the gift card.

Our server Kristina did a good job explaining the different meats and recommending meats for us to grill.  Our selections included the dinner only items (Roast Beef, Galbisal [marinated premium steak]) as well as premium pork belly, beef bulgolgi, and beef brisket.  As a tip, always get the beef brisket because it cooks really fast.  That way you have stuff to eat as the other thicker meats take its time to cook.  

The appetizers we also ordered (again, surprisingly free)  included japchae (glass noodles), miso soup, seaweed salad, pork katsu cutlet, popcorn shrimp, korean fried chicken, and gyoza.   Of course staple mini dishes like kimchee, rice, spicy pickles, and potato salad were also included and waiting on the table when we were seated.

The service was great and overall there seemed to be enough staff as almost every booth was filled with customers and yet the food kept on coming.   There are plenty of tables in this large restaurant and parking is easy as it is connected to Galleria Mall.

The menu here is slightly different from the one in LA.  It appears that there are less items available to order.  The dishes that we received were lacking in flavor, marinate, and sauce.  They cuts were also not as good, or perhaps we got the bad pieces.  It was all very sloppy.

I informed the host that she had just ate Gen and she was accompanying a different party. The female host in the white blouse stated she would try to accommodate us. But after she  briefly spoke with management, they stated their policy was to charge everyone at the sitting table. I think that is a bit inconsiderate when there are 4 potential customers willing to eat at the establishment. 

We left and went to a different AYCE KBBQ called Arirang, which had extremely better service and minimum wait times. They had also accommodated all 5 of us, but minus 1, because my sister was not eating. Their gyoza taste 10x better than Gen as well.

Okay, first problem: We were a party of 5 (for a birthday) on Saturday and came to the restaurant around 6:30 PM. We were told before we got there that the restaurant didn't accept reservations. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. We took a place in line (using their app) and shopped around the mall. After about an hour, there were still 20+ people in front of us. Instead of the 1-1.5, we were not seated until 9 PM! That is 2.5 hours, my friend! I want to kick myself for waiting that long for the crappy experience we had.

Okay, next issue. Our server asked if we wanted any drinks. We asked for waters with lemon, I asked for an alcoholic beverage. The server told me that she was underage and couldn't serve me alcohol, but she would have someone come ASAP. No one ever took my drink order the entire night, but preceded to give me their happy hour drink menu at 9:30 (when happy hour started). I left the menu on the edge of the table, but it obviously wasn't enough of a reminder (way to up-sell). I gave up at one point because I figured if they took that long to take the order, imagine how long it would take to have them serve it. We gave our orders (I ordered most of the ""recommended"" dishes.) which included a few sides of glass noodles and rice. The waters came with a plate of lemons because, according to the waitress ""the bartender was too lazy to put the lemons in glass"". WTF is wrong with your unprofessional staff? Why would you tell us that? And why is a bartender having to prepare WATER???? And isn't it ironic the bartender apparently makes the waters, but not the drink I was trying to order? Whatever, anyways, on to the next issue. 

My boyfriend and I received our raw meat orders. We started grilling it up, but the 3 other guests did not receive their orders. When the waitress stopped to check on us, we pointed out that it is raw meat (therefore it shouldn't take that long) and it had not come out. She said that they were busy, and it shouldn't be that much longer. 15-20 minutes later, she came back and told us that the kitchen ""lost our order"". We ordered everything again, including glass noodles and rice. 

The only plates I would recommend:

K.F.C.
Tofu
Glass Noodles

All of which were already prepared. 

The raw meats were pure fat or tasteless and bland.

Not only that, the waitress was the only person that was slightly nice to us. The other servers were just tossing plates on our table and mumbled which dishes they were, then ran away as fast as they could. We had no idea what they had tossed on the table because we couldn't ask before they dipped out. Also, the person with the credit card machine (I really hope that wasn't the manager, because if so, this place has no hope) had a really bad attitude. The whole time we were there, we felt we had to ration our water (even tried to steal one of the pitchers for the table), the main dishes never came out with the sides (rice and noodles), and it was very difficult to get the servers to take our empty dishes. The shrimp and pork belly were the most unappetizing dishes. The shrimp had a funky taste and the pork belly was all fat. 

Here's the cherry on top: I walked into the ladies room before the check came, and our server was curled up in a ball in front of the sink, next to a stall. Listen, if you're going to break down, please have an ounce of professionalism and cry in a stall where customers do not see you. Or, if you're sick, please call out. It isn't very appetizing to think you're getting sick, then serving my food.

If I owned this restaurant, I'd be pissed. The staff was extremely unprofessional, you need a complete overhaul. I'm shocked this place has the rating it does. I am so bothered by my experience, I'm going to tell everyone to never come to this restaurant and to go to Chinatown instead. I really don't care how cheap it is, I'd be happy to pay $30 for AYCE to never experience that again. Your unprofessional employees are going to make you lose customers and money. Good luck with that.",5,3,2

My wife was in the area and my daughter said her and a friend had gone for Korean bbq ( another establishment ) and had really enjoyed it so they invited me down to join them at Gen, what a mistake. 

Approx 45 min wait which for a popular place is to be expected, but the clubby music should have been a sign of all the soul (Seoul) that was missing from this 'restaurant.' 

We waited for quite a bit for our waiter to find his way out of the weeds and over to our table, whereupon we ordered drinks one of which was a hot green tea. You guessed it, said tea never arrived, although we did get a cup of Lipton and later an attempted delivery of an iced green tea from the manager. 

The meats came out quickly, but the vegetables we ordered only arrived after the waiter again made his way to us after the meats were pretty well done and consumed.  

He again made his way back to let us know he was leaving should we need anything else, lol, there'd be someone else taking care , again lol, of us. 

The new waiter stopped by to say he'd be taking over and I again mentioned the tea and the fact that the veggies came out so late. He said the other waiter had been busy with a large party so...

This is when the Mgr came by with the iced tea, and again said the waiter had been busy,( isn't this what you want as a server? I know I did when I was a waiter.) so we said thanks for stopping by but the experience was beyond salvaging at this point. 

Our new server passed by our cleared table numerous times over the next 15 minutes w\/o making eye contact or bringing us our bill to end our suffering. 

We finally went back to the hostess stand asked for our bill and lo and behold they were still charging us for the tea we never received. Told em we wouldn't be back with the Mgr right there. No response was the response. 

Long story short, don't do it and at $20 per plus drinks, it just ain't worth it.",2,1,1

The meats are awesome and the service is impeccable. It was slow initially but they were changing shifts so that was probably what happened. After that, our plates were taken away quickly and drinks filled promptly like the first time. Today we had our usual fill of cow tongue, rib eye, squid, octopus, and brisket. The sides were good. Nothing exceptional but I came for the meats, truth be told. The octopus is a bit spicy though. Squid was, well squid. Not much flavor to that sucker. Maybe next time I will put some salt on it when grilling it. The meats here are really good for the price of admission.

They bring the food quick and everything seems automated. Even the check out process.they bring the cash register to you literally, albeit in a miniature way.

The edamame (soy beans) were good and the soup was tasty, not too spicy. It came with chunks of tofu today and not the squash from the other day. We also got the fried chicken and man was it crispy! And good too! You have to try it because it's not your KFC or Popeyes chicken. It's fried twice and REALLY crispy.

I give them 5 stars because the food is great but service is awesome too so all in all I give them a 4+1. I think for the price, food, quality, and service, this place wins hands down. If you want to pay 25% more, by all means, try to find a better one. I don't think you will find one as I have not either.

The service is probably the best for Korean places and among the best for all Asian places. They know what you want before you do it seems. I hope it stays that way and not because of the newness. Not that I am stereotyping Asian restaurants but if it quacks like a duck. Besides, I am one of those guys who grimaces when he sees an ugly baby and can't say it out loud ""man that's one ugly winkly baby"" while everyone else expounds praises. Yeah, if Jerry\/Elaine\/Kramer\/George were real, I'd be in their living room\/kitchen all the time.

One bit of advice, get here before 6pm if you can. The place piles on fast. I leave my number and they text you when you should start heading back.

I especially like the spicy octopus n the galbi steak which was tender n had a good marinade. The squid was just salt n peppered. Utilize the scissors, ain't no table side service here. The only time they do anything at your table is when they change the grill. Fast process btw, they got it down to max efficiency.

We came in a little late at 10:30pm n their last call for meat orders is @11pm so we ordered a table full and spent the last hour just cooking n eating. Had a really good time. Our waiter isn't the most skilled at waiting but he certainly tries hard and is super nice.

Ambience is modern, music n blacklight... Nothing distracting though, pretty comforting not having to see other peeps too clearly.

Forgive me for this will be tediously long. LOL. 

Bad experience happened first:
Ok well all the hype about this place made me wanna try it. If it's good in Cali, then it has to be good in Vegas right??? Well.... The first time I went to Gen, the server and hostess were very rude. I understand it's busy, but we're not giving you attitude so why are you? There were 4 people seated with my group and I'm not even joking, we didn't get our meals worth. Why? The server constantly forgot our food, wasn't always checking up on us, and we constantly had to remind him what we ordered. And since they had a 4 item rule, me and my 4 people group always finished  our 4-items pretty fast. Out of all the limited food we ate, I think that the brisket and beef tongue were good. We left with half-satiated stomachs, because we just didn't want to deal with the service anymore. Food was bomb, really wish I tried more. 

I GAVE IT A THOUGHT, and gave Gen another try. 

Good experience:
LETS JUST SAY BRAVO for taking all the criticism and changing some things! I went with my bf to Gen because he never been, and it was totally different. A cool thing they changed is they didn't have the 4-item rule anymore, we can order as much food as want, glorious! As always it was busy, but not one server or hostess was giving me and my bf attitude, GREAT change. Our server TERRY kept up with our orders, he was very intuitive, kind, and observational. Once he saw that we were almost done with our food, he would ask what we wanted. I ended up trying ALL the delicious food I wanted to try the 1st time:
Likes: brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, octopus, salad, potato salad
Dislikes: KFC

Overall, it was awesome the 2nd time. Great food with decent prices and small portions because the quality is amazing. I would like if they changed how they swipe debit\/credit cards cause both times I've been there, they said my debit\/credit card didn't work, but I go eat out at other places and it does -_- I think it's their cashier machine not my card.",0,0,0

Service is pretty good compared to other Korean BBQ place. Food is delicious and they don't give you big portions so you can try more! Ventilation is great here and the place is very modernized. 
When I came here with only one other person, we were sat at a very tall and long table with two other grills. This table is meant to sit multiple small parties. Although, the atmosphere is loud, it feels a little awkward hearing the people next to you have their own conversation.

The only real down side is the payment method. When I came with a party of six, we were not told until after we were done eating, that the cashier can only do up three cards. When I was here with just my sister, we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us out. Even with that, the cashier didn't even apologize for making us wait that long. Both times, the cashier asks if you want to leave a tip which is always pressuring and a bit annoying.
Come here for good kbbq, but expect to have to wait for seating and paying.",0,0,0

The wine took 30 minutes to receive mango drink never came. First order came within 10 minutes.  Did a second order and it never showed up. Asked about 3 time they said next on line. After 35 minutes decided we were leaving. I would of been happy just paying for the 3 drinks and 1 all you can eat cause that amount of food would fill 1 person up.

James was good, he suggested a lot of things for us to try.  Happy hour is at 9:30pm.

The ambiance is nice.  You can have a private table or table with a different party. We came on a Wednesday and we the wait was about 5 mins.  But then they sat us at a table we had to share, then we requested a private table and waited less than 10 mins.  Over all experience was nice.

Located along the mall, next to JC Penny..
I'm so giving this AYCE kbbq a 5+.. By far the BEST kbbq in vegas..All the meats were so tasty, well marinated and tender.. This is even better than the one in California..
They have only open for 8 days and it's packed, came here for lunch @12 ish and had to wait for half an hr. Wkend is $19.99.
They let u order 4 item at a time and everything on the appetizer. They didn't have Cajun fries and Popcorn chicken, which I didn't care for anyway. The KFC chicken was crunchy and tasty. 

They have galbi(short ribs-boneless)... So delish.. MUST order!!! I'm not a fan of pork belly but the #17 smoke garlic belly caught me by surprise.. Not over powering with the smoke flavor.. Really good

All the side dishes were on par. I don't know how many times my niece and I order the side dishes, japchae was alright and I didn't like the fried rice cake(weird texture) skip it!!

I've been a really big fan of Gen ever since I got to try it in California, and it is definitely one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants I have ever been to (although this location still does not compare to the ones in California). Service here is alright, it really depends on who you get as a server.

Lunch price is $14.95 while dinner price is $19.95, which is great considering all the choices of meat that they offer.

When I went here for their grand opening, they still needed to make some adjustments, specifically on their grills. Our grill turned off so many times to the point where it got so annoying, but the servers were nice enough to help us and keep turning it on. It probably would've been better if they transferred us to another table though lol.

Anyway, I'm in love with Korean BBQ, so I definitely went back several more times. The time I went with my friends, service was slow. Our server just kept disappearing, and we had to keep asking other servers for help. Same thing happened when I returned with my boyfriend and my sister also.
The servers just have a really big problem of neglecting their customers. They should always be on sight, especially since this is an all you can eat restaurant, it's expected for people to keep ordering meat, so there really shouldn't be a reason why I can't get a hold of my server.

Another down side to this place is the location and wait. Although I don't really mind driving all the way to Henderson, it takes 20 minutes from my house to get here. So whenever I go here, I always make sure I'm starving, so it's actually worth the drive. I also recommend going here before 6 or 7pm, because that's the time they start to get really busy and the wait can go up to 2 hours, especially if you have a big party. Other than that, everything else is great. This is the only Korean BBQ restaurant I would ever go to in Vegas, because of their exceptional price and high quality meat!",0,0,0

Environment: The inside is very trendy. Neon lights, a projector, and various sections of seating including low booths, high tables, and a full bar. The lighting is somewhat dim but the overall atmosphere is fun and the restaurant is usually full, however not full to the point where I have ever had to wait for more than 20 minutes for a table.

Food: Going to an All You Can Eat restaurant you obviously must sacrifice a little bit of quality for quantity and that's what you get at Gen. However, they do have a rather extensive menu, with stand outs being the Garlic Calamari, Signature Steak, and Premium Pork Belly. Additionally, they do have happy hour later at night which gives you a couple dollars off Beer and Soju.

Service: The service is overall good. They are typically adequately staffed and even if my server seems out of reach there are various other employees habitually checking up on us. Additionally, they are attentive in bringing all the sides I typically request.

Overall, Gen is reliable option for KBBQ if you are in Henderson and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown.",1,0,1

Wait for tables weren't too bad, maybe 15 minutes. Unfortunately we had to be split up. Some say at the higher table while the rest of us were at the booth. Little kids must be at the booth. It can be a little challenging because there isn't too much space, plus when you're trying to cook and hold them at the same time.. 

Lunch price isn't valid on the weekends. That was a bit of a bummer, but we were sure to eat up! 

Service is prompt and friendly. You get your drinks fast and they're on it with refills. Ordering is simple they have a device that puts in your order, so you get your food fast.

The first time I went was fine.  We had four people and got sat relatively quickly at a table with two grills.  We got our food and cooked.  The flame was really low so it took a long time to cook\/eat but the experience was fine.  

The second time was a mess.  We had 6 people this time and got crammed into a booth with one grill.  The place was really busy when we went so we weren't really expecting fast service but what we got was a snail's pace.  We got our drinks and free sides quickly enough but with those, our entire table was already filled up.  Like there wasn't any room to put anything!  We all ordered our food and it came out but the servers didn't have anywhere to put it so they kind of just looked at us to either finish the free sides (which are supposed to accompany the meal) or hold the sides so they could put the meats down.  None of us could eat at the same time and we had the grill so filled with food (one from each person, with one or two people left out bc of room) that the food took about 45 minutes to an hour to cook!  This was totally unacceptable but we couldn't complain because our servers didn't come back for another 45 minutes or so.  Our table was literally piled high with used dishes and empty plates, some 6 plates tall!  We got so upset at how long it was taking to cook the food that we decided to just order ready made dishes.  Half of what we ordered they said they were out of, even though the table next to us ordered the same food ten minutes after we did and got it promptly delivered.  We were honestly so pissed at this point.  I hate their two card policy, I hate how expensive it is when we are doing most of the work, I hate how little seasoning they give with your food, I hate how weak their grills are, and I don't understand why this place is so popular!  I am giving it 2 stars because of my first experience.  The last time I was there definitely gets a 1 star.

My personal favorite on their menu was number 10, their premium marinated steak.

One thing this gen lacks though in comparison to the California locations is the infamous rice paper due to it being a Las Vegas health code violation. But I didn't complain, I never ate the rice paper anyways. What I was disappointed in it missing though was the rib fingers (meat between the ribs), and the daikon radish.

But despite that, gen still packs a punch in the gut, a good one that is! Their appetizer menu will keep you plenty satisfied in between main course orders and their selection is pretty large, unfortunately the seasoned fries, popcorn shrimp, and calamari are usually the first to go so I've yet to try myself. Wait times can take up to an hour, and the room occupancy is slightly smaller than their California counter parts, but still an hour wait beats the 120 min wait I've endured in the oc and rancho locations.. So be ready ahead of time.

Over all though, nothing beats a $20 all you can eat premium Korean bbq. Just be sure to clear out your schedule if you plan on going because you'll need it open for the food coma recovery!",4,0,1

Once seated, the hostess told me about the all you can eat option, but did not advise that it was mandatory. We ordered drinks (hot tea) that did not arrive until 10 mins into my meal. My Mom doesn't eat meat, only fish, so she ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer. I told our server about this and she didn't say anything. She also ordered the seaweed salad (which never arrived). 

Upon receiving the bill, I saw a charge for 2 all you can eat meals. I let the hostess know we only had one AYCE as my Mom is not able to eat meat, so she ordered an appetizer which the server acknowledged. She let me know AYCE is mandatory and she would have to get the manager. 

The ONLY reason I am giving this restaurant a 2 star rating is because the manager was extremely accommodating and pleasant about this issue. He didn't hassle me and fixed this issue. He advised that individual pricing is on the menu for appetizers only as a courtesy for lunch, not dinner (again, not explained). Thankfully though, he was great.

First of all, it's located at Galleria Mall, but you don't have to actually enter the mall to get to the restaurant, which is a plus (IMO). There is also tons of parking, which is another bonus.

The decor is super cute. It's dimly lit, but not overly romantic (unless you want it to be). It's not a small place either.

For $19.95 per person, it's hard to complain. It's AYCE and the food was all delicious. We seriously had a bit of everything. Be careful when ordering though, they will charge you extra for wasted food. I can imagine that would be pretty awkward.

This place gets pretty busy during dinner time so be aware that the wait time for a table might be long. The atmosphere and design of the place is really nice and I enjoyed the big projector screen.

Once we got our table we were greeted immediately and our server was very nice and helped us with our order. I really enjoyed the brisket and the spicy bulgogi selections and they were all very juicy.

The meat does not take long to cool and it's a fun experience with family or friends. The servers use cool touchscreen pads to take our orders and the meat comes to our table pretty quick.

I really appreciate when one of the servers request for a grill change because over time our grill gets really greasy and dirty and we probably had our grill changed 4 times.

The overall service was excellent and will definitely recommend eating here for dinner.

Can't wait to take the kids here.  This was a great fun experience.  Is the food the best in Vegas? No.  Are the servers\/bartenders the best in Vegas? No.  But this isn't some high end Vegas strip joint.  This is a restaurant outside the Galleria mall.  And let me tell you, it's worth every penny.  There is a considerably large selection of meats you can choose from for $20!  We happen to go here by mistake.  We intended to go to the steakhouse next door but this caught our eye and we lucked out.  My wife made me eat the baby octopus.  It did not taste like chicken, I repeat IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CHICKEN.  Whoever tells you that is full of it.  But it was good.  The meat portions aren't huge, which is good because you'll want to sample a lot of them.  And you really won't be able to try them all in a single visit.  You do all the cooking yourself.  We ended up paying $65 after two dinners, a couple drinks and a 23% gratuity.  The place has casual and open atmosphere.  It would be great to meet up with friends to have a great social time.

Now,
For the negatives. This was our 1st time and they explained the menu very quickly.  We had to ask 2x for our noodles and steak and soy sauce. 
The HUGE negative is my 12 year old son ordered the ALREADY COOKED Sesame Chicken and after eating most of it he offered me a piece..... it was RAW! We told the waiter. Who apologized. However, I'm sorry but u just fed my child RAW chicken. My son then didn't want anything else to eat. 
When the cashier came with the bill she asked if everything was good.... Um no.  I explained to her what happened and all she said was sorry. I didn't expect all of our meals to be free. However, I did expect my sons to be. That would have been customer service.

I ordered the signiture steak, baby octopus, cajun shrimp, marinated beef, beef tongue, beef brisket and miso soup. Being solo, the portions were large and filling to the point that I was plenty  full although I wanted to check out the dessert menu. Unfortunately  they didn't offer desserts yet - because they're so new.

Our waiter was Ozzie. Very nice fellow, took his time explaining how it worked. It is an all you can eat but where you order and they bring it to your table. They bring you as much as you want and they also checked back regularly. I'd suggest the KFC (Korean fried chicken), the pork ___ (I forget what it was called but it is an appetizer that comes out cooked) also the pork steak. The apps come out cooked, the entrees you cook yourself in the center of the table. The regular steak is nice, and is the spicy chicken bulgogi.
tip: do not get the brisket. It is too thin, it cooks to nothing. Waste of time really to order that.

Customer Service: 3\/5

- Everybody was very nice and smiley. The issue I had was that the restaurant was super busy, instead of the waiter coming around and checking up on us we had to wave down the waiter or ask the bus boy to get him for me. I think if the staff was more prepared for the volume of customers then the service would be better.

Food: 4\/5

- The food here was bomb! We ate here with a Korean local that ordered all of our food for us and let me tell you I'm glad we had her. The meats where very well seasoned and the portions were perfect for sharing and trying out all the different items on their menu. My issue comes with the rice, the first batch we got seemed like it was a day old and cold, the second just didn't taste right.

Presentation: 3\/5

- The stove top that his restaurant uses is a stick top, not a non-stick top. All the meats we cooked got stuck to the stove and we had to rip it off just to flip it, not cool. 

Price:  5\/5

- For the amount off food and the quality of the food I can't complain about the price. For lunch AYCE is 15$ and for night AYCE it's 20$. Not a bad price at all and very reasonable

Overall: 4\/5

Food is good, service is good. I'd say the service exceeded our expectations, but after the 9th time of different servers always checking up on us & asking if everything's ok gets kinda annoying especially when your trying to enjoy your food. The only thing I had a problem with was the way their checkout system works, they do it on a tablet which relies on wifi signal for credit\/debit card transactions. So if your card doesn't go through once they'll do it again. My card was charged twice, but hopefully that'll clear up. Overall good place & atmosphere, being that they're relatively new in town they can make some tweaks.",0,0,0

We came in at 10:30 and during the first round of our meal the hostess brought out our check saying ""were closing the register soon so heres your check."" They close at 12am not 10:45pm. I work in the restaurant industry and can understand wanting to close the restaurant in a timely manner, but an hour and 15 minutes early when the register is most likely closed last is ridiculous. 
When we came in, a table next to us left and a huge piece of chicken fell on the floor (see photo). It was left in the walking aisle the entire time we were dining in. I stepped on it once i forgot about it and so did my boyfriend. The server would accidentally kick it, but still not pick it up. It was disgusting. 
Also, the appetizers sit out on the tables until someone comes which is gross and not fresh. At least other kbbq places plastic wrap them until someone comes. I took a photo of an empty table with appetizers waiting. No one ever sat at this table and they took the appetizers out probably to reuse them to sit out the next day. 
Our water was not refilled once due to everybody being too busy closing. We finally got a water refill after we asked after we paid our bill. 
Our server was one of those people that just took orders, but didn't provide any customer service. 
2 stars for food. Food was good and quick and came out before our waters hit the table.",1,0,0

I love their salad dish but their kimchi stew is lacking and not good. You cook the bbq yourself but they should really consider switching out or using a different grill top for certain meats since certain ones just burn and stick which seems like a waste. The chadol kept sticking and got ruined but meats that are marinated cooked well and was delicious. Some of their side dishes were pretty good and during busy times it can be hard to get good service. Overall food is good and service can be good depending on what time you get in.,0,0,0

Its already hot outside. I expect atleast to be able to eat comfortably not swimming in sweat! My son has asthma and could barely breathe! Its a shame me and my family are regulars and love the food here. My sons favorite dish is the kfc. We have been out all day and didn't eat to save our appetite for dinner so we decided to stay and still eat because they actually had the chicken today.

Thats one more thing too. You never know when they wonmt have something on the menu. Last week they had none of the fried chickens! ALL OF THE CHICKEN WAS UNAVAILABLE. And this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT?!? And the squid bulgogi is NEVER available. Why don't they just take it off the menu if you don't even serve it anymore?? 

Now every single time we come, we are either greeted by the hostess or not. You have to really try to figure out what day is a good day when these people aren't in a mood. Almost every single time we come, they are never smiling. And talk to you as if its such a bother to them to have to take you to a table and explain the rules. Its as if they really hate their jobs and take it out on us customers. What kind of hostesses are these?!? The lady that had a red shirt took us to our table today. With a very annoyed and condescending tone, asked us if we've been here before we said yes and she continued to tell us the rules with the same tone. Not once did she smile and had the expression on her face as if we had done something horrible. I've worked in the food industry and understand when a customer is being really unreasonable and rude. And since I understand that, me and my family ARE never rude yet we still get treated like this with the VERY FIRST person that is supposed to take care of us. We always just let it go because the service after that is usually okay and the food comes out really quick. 

But tonight was the absolute worst! Appetizers were super slow, drinks didn't come until 20 minutes later, not even getting refilled until conpletely gone, grill kept turning off and our server did the best he could to fix it but was still cooking very slowly, we were getting meats that we didn't even order and find out the server made a mistake and it was for the other table, and most especially it was HOT. I suggest no one comes here during the summer since their ac is broken!",1,1,0

The service is also really good. They have it down to a science, everyone from the hostess to the servers works hard to make sure you are attended to. The only read I'm knocking them down to 4 vs. 5 stars is: 1) They hesitate to allow you to order more if you have a few items still to cook... which I understand to an extent but if we have 4 people and only 1 plate left, let me order... we are here bc we are hungry. Lol. Not a huge complaint but frustrating if you are starving. 2) I am a little disappointed that there are not more vegetables options...

I walked in on a weekday lunch, without an appointment.  No problem seating us.  The place was nice and new.  It didn't reek of bbq, which was nice.  I came here for their lunch buffet which is $14.99!  Such a good deal!   There are some items that are not available on the lunch menu, but still a lot to enjoy.  I had the steak, sesame chicken and the squid legs are probably my favorites.  The spicy pork was also good.  I could not try everything on the menu, but there is enough for me to keep coming back.  Just an FYI there is a 2 hr eating limit.

One of my gripes was at the end of the meal I asked if they have tea, and the server said they do and would bring some over.  They asked who wanted, and 3 of us raised our hands.  Then came the bill...$1.50 for each cup of tea!  I would have wished to be informed that it wasn't complimentary.  In most Asian restaurants tea is free like water.  To make matters worse, the tea wasn't very good either.  I told the hostess that we were not informed that the tea would be an extra cost, and she just gave me an ""Oh Well"" kind of look.  If I had know I would be charged I would have passed on the tea.  I didn't even drink the whole glass.  I didn't take the matter any further and just paid for the the damn tea and still gave them 20% tip.  I know I'm a idiot.

Overall, I am willing to give this place a chance again.  As some reviewers have mentioned, this place does need to workout some hiccups in their service.  We had some items we ordered take forever, or forgotten completely, but it was okay for us.  Not a big deal.  Then the tea thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, in more ways than one.  If I was the hostess, I would have taken the item off the bill and note that in the future I would be a $1.50.  The tea probably only cost them 5 cents!  It could have made the whole experience more positive!  I look forward to hearing that things will improve there.",2,1,0

1. It always smells like clorox and oil. Kudos for being clean, but the smell is not so appetizing.

2. I've gotten sick, twice. I blame the side dishes on the table that are always sitting there before anyone is seated. I watched a table from beginning of my meal-end and saw the sides still sitting out. Is that potentially a health violation?!

3. The chairs are falling apart! If you're wearing shorts, as I do in this Vegas heat, forget being comfortable! The seats will scratch your thighs all meal long.

It has been almost 3 years since I last set foot in a KBBQ place since leaving California, there was always that hesitation that nothing could ever compare lol.

All that changed when I tried Gen for the first time last night. The food itself I would give 4 stars, more on that later. What really sold me on this place is the crews dedication and quality of service. TOP NOTCH. I have never seen a group of people work so good together, everyone was in sync. It wasn't like, this is your table\/area you deal with it. They all pitched in as far as clearing your plates, asking if we needed anything else, can I replace your grill? And all with courteousness and smiles to boot. It was fine dining caliber of service for sure! Our waiter Ozzy was wonderfully pleasant and friendly, almost giddy lol like he truly enjoyed being there. I think that speaks volumes on how management runs this place. Though it was busy on a Wednesday night it wasn't chaotic.

For starters we ordered their crispy sesame chicken and pork cutlet, both moist and flavorful. The banchan offered were tasty though I wish there was more choices, I would've loved to see some bean sprouts and fish cakes. The meat selection was plentiful, too much choices if you ask me. We settled with the crowd favorites: 

-Gen Yangyum Galbisal (marinated premium steak) only offered during dinner AYCE which is $19.99 by the way. Delicious marinade that you can really taste. 

-Spicy Pork Bulgogi I'm a weak sauce and a sissy so I didn't enjoy this as much but hubby loved it. The beef bulgogi on the other hand was melt in your mouth goodness!

-Gen Chadol is my go to in every KBBQ place, it cooks very quickly and it's scrumptious wrapped in Rice paper (another HUGE plus for this place is they carry rice paper, brings back such great memories of home) and dipped in sesame oil and salt. Ahhhhh I'm craving this again!

-Smoked Garlic Samgyubsal (pork belly) is the least of my favorite, though it was good and tasted like bacon, the garlic flavorful was not prominent at all.

Of course we couldn't leave without trying their Macaron ice cream sandwich. It was tasty but not worth the $3.95 price tag in my opinion with its minuscule portion. Definitely looking forward to going back, it's a great place to eat and be merry with friends and family. Only bad thing is it's quite a trek for us to get there but maybe that's a good thing or else we'll find ourselves here a little more than our waistlines would like.",21,13,16

Returned here about 2 months after I wrote this post and they took away the crispy calamari!! The best thing on the menu. Kind of bummed about that. I tried something called a spicy Korean rice cake. It was different. I liked the texture but not the sweet and spicy sauce on top of it. I noticed that they do have a macaroon machine out front now but it's an extra charge! Come on now!

Don't believe me, check out Brian K's profile. Yelping since 2012, and two reviews? Also, his profile links to his Facebook, which shows he works at Gen Korean BBQ House.

Enough about their gaming the system, to artificially inflate the ratings for this new Korean BBQ joint in Henderson. My wife and I were unsure where to go, as she is half Korean, we eat at a LOT of Korean BBQ places, in Vegas, and on the road. Galleria's newest food additions all look amazing from the outside, and this place was busy for a Monday night! The check-in process was great, you give a #, they text you your progress in queue. 

We were seated, and had the standard corporate greeting, ""Is this your first time eating here with us? Oh, great, let me explain..."" of course it is, you have only been open a couple days. Our server had minimal knowledge of the food, but brought out our drinks rather quickly. And then, a second person came to bring our drinks out. Overly efficient, or inept duplication?

Our food was ordered, after being told there is a two hour time limit for the AYCE foods. The menu looked like there was a wide selection of options. Our first round of meats came out, and only two of them were right.

So, they brought out 2x the drinks, and 50% wrong food to start. My wife ordered edamame, and was brought out a salad. 

When they delivered the meats, they gave my wife her boneless Kalbi rib type option, and put down some thinly sliced meat, and said it was spicy pork. They dropped off chicken and what they said was bulgogi to me.

Spicy pork is coated in a red paste, but she gave it a try, just in case. It was beef bulgogi. When correcting it, they took the beef bulgogi, and brought out spicy pork. What they told me was bulgogi was pork. It took a while to get the right food brought out, after having our server tell me that beef turns white, depending on the marinade used. Ummmm. No. Pork turns white, beef turns brown, please try again. That got straightened out, thanks to a California trainer.  

As to the flavor... the chicken bulgogi tasted like burnt soy sauce, and the beef bulgogi was just flavorless mush.

After that... We only saw our server as he spent 20+ minutes chatting with a guy two tables over. Other tables around us were heard asking random employees, ""Who is our server?!"" We waited, and waited to pay. Finally, we just got up and went to the hostess. They aren't supposed to get our check for us, but did. Upon giving them a quick rundown of how our visit went, they got the GM. He is a very nice guy, who took our feedback, as a manager should, and said he would address the issue with his staff.",8,5,0

3. Service is great, I love the staff there what a difference in treatment compared to Las Vegas.
When it first opened, it was so busy I could not get in until an hour or two later.  
Waiters and waitresses are very attentive to your requests, if they have it they will get it to you asap. Drinks are average price, it's understandable-they run out of special cocktails sometimes.  The decor is sleek and modern, the audience is very diverse. I would give it five if they start developing a customer's promotion system, give me a free meal for how many meals I already had at the place.  Fresh, modern, and tasty!",0,0,0

Not only the food, but Luke's service drew us back to Gen. Not even a week apart, my boyfriend and I came back and this time Sam was our server. And his service was terrible. He was no where to be found when we needed to order more food. We asked two different servers to find Sam and 20 minutes later, still nowhere to be found. We had to go up to the hostess to pay our bill. We still tipped him $5, but he definitely did not deserve it. So you're welcome Sam.

I've had Gen KBBQ at numerous of their locations both in SoCal and the one in Henderson, NV. The Henderson, Nevada location leaves a little bit to be desired over not only other KBBQ restaurants, but other Gen locations. 

Their menu seems to be toned down here a little bit, and is rather Americanized. Growing up in Los Angeles, you have a lot of authentic choices in terms of cuts of meats and sides at KBBQ restaurants. Gen offers them, but they just taste...a little different. A little, less dramatic, should I say. And to my earlier point, is what causes me to highlight this location as being rather ""domesticated"". Which is a shame.

If you come to this location, be prepared for a wait, much as you would at any of their other locations. 

The staff here is all VERY polite and friendly, and service is usually rather expeditious, which is the only plus side to this being ""Americanized"". If you've been to Korean run KBBQ restaurants that are authentic, you know good service is the last think you should expect.

All in all, good restaurant for KBBQ. 

Would I come back here again? Yup.

Would I recommend this place to others? Sure, as long as they aren't expecting something too authentic.",4,3,3

On second thought, it might be the ONLY Korean BBQ place in the area :P Anyways, this is a very chic, contemporary restaurant; The interior is dim with blue lighting by the sitting area. I would say that the setting is nice for a date or a family outing. I haven't been to their CA locations but its a nice restaurant all around.

The prices are very reasonable, AYCE for under $25 and no choice A, B, C here - $25 gives you everything on the menu. The Red Wine Samgyupsal is to DIE for! This exclusive meat is by far my favorite selection on their menu. They have all the tried and true selections such as galbi, bulgogi, briskets and beef tongue. TIP: Order at least three dishes of the brisket and beef tongue. They give you literally 7-10 pieces per order, like what...That's not even enough to feed a small hamster. So make sure you order at least three at a time ;) The quality of the meat is very good and tastes fresh. The meat is chopped thin and nicely so they are easy and quick to cook. 

The service is pretty good considering how busy it is. I've been there 4 times now and everytime it is a packed house. Still, the servers are diligent about refilling drinks and taking orders. To get seated, expect to wait at least 15 minutes if you have no reservations. On a busy night you might wait up to 30 minutes or more easily. Book a reservation if you can.",5,5,4

I went with my friend Rachel and a couple of her peeps. We arrived a little after 12:30 and waited just a few minutes while they prepared our table. I thought we were getting the lunch price, but they do not do lunch on the weekends. Still at $19.99 pp, that is not a bad deal.

Our server was nice, she did have a very thick accent so it made it kind of hard to understand her. She explained the menu to us, and how it works. Everything is AYCE, so you can order as much as you want. Most everything comes raw, and you cook on the grill in the middle of your table. This way you can cook to your liking. You are given a menu with a list of different meats, as well as appetizers. The items we tried:

Appetizers
Gyoza- Really yummy. Little fried dumplings with dipping sauce, one of my favorites
Edamame- It's edamame with salt, nothing good and nothing bad.
Sesame Chicken- Fried and comes with sriracha mayo (I think) dipping sauce 
KFC chicken- Korean Fried Chicken, tasty with a little bit of spice. Reminds me of General Chix
Popcorn Shrimp- Not much to say bout this one. Came with the sriracha mayo that is yummy.
We wanted cajun fries, but they were out.

Main Course
Salad- Comes to your table with your dinner. Had a delicious ginger dressing on top.
Veggies- Mixed veg, green pepper, green onion, and zucchini I think. Tasty when grilled.
Spicy Rice Cake- OMG these are delicious.  
Garlic Chicken- Comes with a side of jalapeno nacho cheese, wtf?? Not that garlicky.
Beef Bulgogi- Yummmy. 
Spicy Chicken- This is very spicy! 
Spicy Baby Octopus- I wanted to be adventurous and try this out, but I didn't like it at all. it was spicy and chewy. 
Brisket- This was my fav. Super thin and delicious.
Rice- White rice to accompany our meal

We ordered a lot of food, and by the time we were done, everyone was super full. I would be careful in ordering because if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, like ours, you might give yourself a stomachache trying to finish. The thing is, you can't take anything home and they charge for uneaten meat. All in all, I have to say this was a fun experience. I told my boyfriend about it and he can't wait to go.

At the end of our meal, when the person that took our payment asked what our favorite part of dinner was...I told her it was our waitress! They don't take reservations but if you can request Alodia, I would! 

I was surprised by how good the quality of the meat was considering the affordable AYCE price. ($20.99 for dinner) When you sit down, you have your standard side dishes on the table already and the server brings you salad. Once you place your order, the server will also bring rice for everyone at the table. My favorite items were Bulgogi and the K.F.C. chicken. (Korean Fried Chicken. It's a sweet and spicy chicken that comes to the table already cooked. We ordered it twice because it was so good! The Bulgogi takes a while to cook but it had the most flavor out of what I ordered. The only dish I didn't like was the pork belly. I'm usually a fan but it wasn't good at all. (I could only eat one bite)

We decided to approach the host to let her know what is the status about our table and why is everyone else getting seated before us and she turns the iPad to us and says "" I did call you guys and you never came"", usually I can hold my temper but that's when I got pissed and preceded to tell her that,  ""you never called us and we have been sitting inside practically right next to the host booth  and not once did we hear you call our name, you've called every other group that came AFTER and BEFORE us.""

I wish they had just a little bit more selection on the meats (I heard the Cali locations have more?) but otherwise the service is great. Their building had some issues with AC when it was 100+ outside but hopefully it's fixed.  I also appreciate the ventilation that's built in to the table. It's quiet and does a good job.

Gen has been on my radar for a few weeks now and I did I enjoy my dinner there this week. I have to admit that it was more for the experience and the great service standards they keep that made me enjoy it. The food ended up being very average. Is it a contender for a go-to Korean BBQ spot? They did have a lot of pluses, but in short, no. I'd describe this as KBBQ for the masses like Olive Garden to Italian food. At $15 for their lunch menu and $20 for their dinner menu the price is pretty average for Las Vegas.

I'm going to assume everyone understands AYCE Korean BBQ: you cook your own meat on a grill and eat the meats with a variety of mostly pickled side dishes.

Gen is in a beautiful space outside of the re-vamped Galleria Mall. There is no entrance to and from the mall through the restaurant. The servers and hosts use a tablet to check you in, place orders, and ring up your meal. This made the meal enjoyable as the tablet sends tickets to the kitchen in real time. That means that food is coming to your table before your whole order is taken.

The restaurant has a lot of open and shared seating to accommodate small parties and large parties if necessary. I think one of the high counters can seat 12 people on 3 grills or 3 groups of 4 on those same grills. It was so annoying to me that nothing separated some tables because figuring out who gets what space. Also the staff would bring stuff and I wouldn't know who it was for: us or them. They seemed annoyed that I kept asking if the food was ours or theirs lol.

They boast a 30+ item menu which is completely AYCE. They have appetizers like chicken karage and fried spicy squid tentacles that set them apart. KBBQ can get boring even if you love meat. Having fried appetizers really add something to the meal that satisfies my taste buds. With that being said, most of the appetizers were just okay. We tried the agedashi tofu, fried chicken, KFC chicken, sea weed salad, squid tentacles, gyoza. Everything was a-okay, but nothing stand out, nothing special, and nothing I'd order all night. 

The seafood proteins they offer like whole shrimp, baby octopus, and squid are unique to me and were my favorite part of the meal. The spicy shrimp was very good! Flavorful and spicy. The garlic squid was also good- tender and flavorful.

Out of all of their sides the one I liked most was their salad. Their dressing was very good and I asked for refills a couple of times. Their spicy tofu soup was also good. A lot of tofu and the perfect amount of spice. 

Now that the good is out of the way here comes the down side.

Although the list of meats they offer was extensive, none of them were anything special. There was nothing I'd order a second time. We probably ordered everything and I found their meats to be some what off. Average quality? Or maybe just not what I'm used to. The end of all of their pork belly meats were cute way too thin. They all had a hard rubbery cap too that was almost plastic-y. I also commend their ""signature steak"" to be a nice offering but it was just boring and bland. Their short ribs were also a miss. 

The meats I thought were okay: red mine marinated pork belly and of course the shrimp and squid.

I did enjoy my experience at Gen. I like what they're doing by introducing Korean BBQ to the masses outside of China Town. Im pretty sure it's a chain as I've seen friends in other states post about it. My highlights for this place was the great service, the ""ambience"", and the variety in their menu. With their pretty big seafood selection I'm sure anyone can find something to eat here.

The atmosphere is comfortable and trendy, the food selection is plentiful, and the staff members are very pleasant. However, the service is subpar, the quality of the food is nothing special, and the sanitary condition and cleanliness is questionable in parts of the restaurant that give pause to parts unseen. The confusion and disorganization however became a primary focus instead of enjoying the dining experience. 

I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, but I don't live in Henderson. I needed a reason to travel this way - and my friend's invitation was the motivating force. I was excited as I love cultural food varieties and the concept of a cook-it yourself Korean BBQ peeked my interest. 

Upon walking in to GEN, we were told our wait would be 30-minutes as they were quite busy. So, we headed over to the bar for our wait but became confused where to sit. It is an eating bar so grills are located between seats. I would have had no problem sitting down regardless of the grill plates, but the restaurant policy is obviously to presets the standard sides along the grill plates (e.g., spicy cucumbers, Korean potatoes salad, kimchi, meat dipping sauce & salt). I think having people stand around preset food is a little unsanitary. So, my stomach was slightly turning before ever sitting down to eat. Upon being seated, our assigned table also had preset seasonal sides at the table. This is truly a strange concept - I mean we are not talking about sealed condiments or salt & peppershakers. We are talking about open ramekins of food on tables in a busy restaurant with numerous people eating around these tables were preset food is placed. Not even the silverware in this restaurant is open to the elements - why the food?

We first ordered some Gen appetizers to give us time to look over the meat selection on the menu. The Crispy Squid Legs were tough to eat. The Gyoza was very good. The Pork Cutlet was good but arrived lukewarm. About 10-minutes after we received the three appetizers another server tried to bring us another set of appetizers not realizing we already received our order. But, the atmosphere of confusion doesn't end here.

Throughout the dinning experience we tried many selections of meat. We had the Gen Galbisal, Garlic Chicken, Gen Chadol, Pork Belly, Smoked Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Spicy Octopus, and Cajun Shrimp. There was really nothing that stood out as an amazing choice. Some of the meat had great flavor but most was bland that had to be dipped in the salt sauce provided. The garlic chicken came with a cheese like dip in a tin ramekin that had to be tossed on the grill plate so it could be made dippable. 

Food runners would drop off ordered meat selections and run as abruptly as they arrived. At times, we were confused about what had been delivered - and searching for someone to answer this question after it was dropped off was futile. The answers tended to feel more like  guesses. Some answers were blantantly not correct with what appeared to be staff feeling compelled to give an answer - any answer. For example when asked what the side selections were, I was told my romaine salad was the seaweed salad :) I know what seaweed salad looks like - so really? When I asked what meat selection was dropped off - beef tongue or Gen Chadol, I was told it was Gen Chadol. It was a different quantity than was previously ordered and it didn't taste quit the same,  so I used the menu pictures for comparison. Yup, I ate my friends beef tongue thinking it was my Chadol.

The service staff appeared to be going in two directions at the same time - rather consistently. It was standard to wait long periods of time to have the grill plate replaced (or lit). Meanwhile, inhaling the burning smoke from food particles that fused to the stainless steal plate and produced a flowing, burning stream of smoke not caught by the under grill filtration system was uncomfortable. It really ruined the mediocre experience! 

Cooking the meats on the grill was easier when oil was put on the grill plates because the plates are super hot and the meat instantly sticks. Some wait staff would bring oil when changing the plates and others would not. Often times by the time you realize THIS server didn't bring oil, and didn't ask if any was desired, he was off and running. If you were lucky enough to catch a waiter to ask for oil the wait was usually 5-10 minutes. Additionally, not one server could tell me what kind of oil they were using on the grill plates. 

Lastly, there is a garbage and plate collection station outside of the restroom area. It is an unsightly, gross scene.  I can't stand to see dirty dish stations. That is something that should be in the back of a restaurant. I am not sure the flow of this restaurant was considered before the opening.

My Mango-Tini was really good! -  In the end, I won't be in a hurry to return.",11,6,4

Literally everyone has been raving about GEN so I finally went to check it out with a friend who's never had KBBQ before. I was really excited and looking forward to try a newer KBBQ spot in town, especially after hearing all of the positive reviews. 

It's definitely the most Americanized AYCE KBBQ I've ever been to. All of the KBBQ places are usually employed by Koreans, smaller hole in the wall type restaurants (besides Sura, which is huge). GEN is located in Galleria Mall and the inside is ginormous and quite colorful. The ventilation is great so you don't have to worry about leaving smelling like a walking piece of grilled KBBQ meat. I couldn't help but notice that they played old school R&B and love songs...(?) The menu also strayed a bit away from a traditional KBBQ menu. Some apps were popcorn shrimp, edamame, and fries (?!?) Interesting choices to say the least.

The meat was subpar. I usually go for brisket but since I was with a newbie, I ordered a variety of meats to share: 

- Brisket; Pretty good! Very juicy
- Bulgogi; Fatty, the marinade was so-so
- Kalbi; Tender, same marinade as Bulgogi but the quality of meat tasted better 
- Spicy Pork Bulgogi; One of the more flavorful meats, not very spicy but tasted good. Also fatty
- Pork Belly\/Smoked Garlic Pork Belly; The slices were SO thin that it cooked really fast. I've cooked pork belly enough times to know when it's time to eat, but these thin slices tasted like pure bacon
- Spicy BBQ Chicken; Took FOREVER to cook thoroughly and tasted like a teriyaki stir fried chicken. Definitely not worth the wait. Took over 10 minutes for sure 
- Spicy Baby Squid; We ate the legs and not the head. We both actually really enjoyed the flavor

The salad was good and tasted similar as salads served at typical KBBQs. For dipping, we each received soy sauce\/vinegar and salt\/pepper. I had to ask the server for sesame oil to add into the salt\/pepper. The banchan (side dishes) tasted average. We also ordered Japchae (Korean stir-fried glass noodles) which was tasteless and dry and the Fried Gyoza which was unmemorable. 

Overall the service was pretty decent. They changed the grill out for us frequently (which was good because the meats would burn and the grill would get black rather quickly... they didn't use any oil on the grills) and our waters were refilled whenever empty. We had to call a server over to order more meats a few times which was the only negative, especially since they weren't very busy on a Weekday afternoon.

I think I went with too high of expectations. Unfortunately I was not impressed. I would give GEN:

-1\/5 for the overpowering grill which we kept trying to decrease the heat but would somehow end up burning the grill anyway 
-2\/5 for the side dishes and apps 
-3\/5 for the meat taste\/quality
-4\/5 for the overall customer service
-4\/5 for the ambiance (gorgeous restaurant but doesn't fit KBBQ? The love songs also caught me off guard when trying to feast on meat and kimchi...)

I'd recommend venturing to Spring Mountain for a more authentic and tasty AYCE KBBQ dining experience.",13,4,11

There were already 8 other parties ahead of us, so it took about 45 minutes to get a table but it was definitely worth it. If you're having a get together with friends during a busy time I would suggest trying to get someone there a bit early and putting their name on the list first and then go in the mall and shop around while they wait for the rest of the party to arrive. Just keep your phone handy because they text you when your table is almost ready. 

The quality\/taste of the food was great, the price is competitive (20$ for dinner and I think like 15$ for lunch), the place is nice and the service was great too! I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant and can't wait to come back. 

It's quite a drive for me but it's definitely worth it. I won't ever go to other places like Sura or Hwaro again because they have a much larger selection of food. Their dinner menu is hugeee. There's 32 items that you can choose from and the appetizers are also part of the AYCE menu, so that was a definite plus!

It is actually new and for the price, the service and the atmosphere, you can't beat it. If you like Korean BBQ especially All You Can Eat, I definitely suggest this as a bucket list when you're in Las Vegas, it's a little ways off the strip but definitely worth it!

The set up is pretty modern. It almost looks like a nice night\/bar club, with neon lights to eccentric the visuals and seating from high top tables to regular booth tables. Unlike most KBBQ places, this place is well ventilated and doesn't hit you with that strong BBQ smoke smell. The ventilation system used here is actually different from others that I've experienced. Most other places have an overhead vent that sucks the smoke out, however here, they have it built into the actual stove. So when you are cooking you meals, the smoke is instantly sucked right back down. Don't worry it doesn't affect the taste, or smell of the food.

The price to do all you can eat was only $14.95 and that included your big list of meats to choose from, up to 20 different types of meat! You can't beat that, most other places only give you from a range of 3 - 6 types of meat. Also to add, the All you can eat also includes appetizers! So for that price and the ability to PIG OUT, definitely can't pass that up. I would definitely recommend to try everything! The different marination of pork bellies, to bulgogi, to cajun shrimps and squids. 

If you are wanting to enjoy a alcoholic beverage, they also have a bar there that serve pretty good signature drinks. I had a Lychee Martini and it was on point! Especially for the price of $2.83! If I wasn't so beat up from Sin City, I would have ordered more! 

The service is great, all the servers take time to come serve you and help one another out. They are also using modern technology (tablets) to take your order so that helps expedite ordering. They even use a tablet with a portable receipt printer so you don't even have to wait long to pay, they'll take care of you right then and there!

The environment is one of the best and very hip and trendy, with blue LEDs to create the ambiance!  Hopefully, it will be kept up and cleanliness not let go. The only negative I have is the shortness on wait staff.

I went here within 9 days of opening, and there were already over 155 reviews due to the soft opening. It speaks for their reputation carrying over from California. 

I like their text messaging system during the wait, so you can walk around the mall. We were told that the wait would be 30 at most so stayed put at the bar area, but it was rather 45 minutes, and that's a lot when you're starving. I WAS HAAAAAAANGRY. 

A great idea and concept that they have a variety of tapas available besides korean BBQ--there is no place like this in Vegas. 

One major critique about this place is their grill pan. It's stainless, and without any oil to properly coat it, your meat will stick and get stuck, unless you constantly move it around. This was most challenging for thin cuts like brisket or bulgogi. And evidently, it would burn so quickly so the grill change had to be conducted frequently. On a side note, we had to ask them for something to put on the grill pan, and it wasn't incorporated into the server's routine. Not sure why we had to ask, since it would save them extra work (changing pans) if they came up with a way to prolong the grill pan cook cycle. 

We tried a variety of meats, and I wasn't too impressed with the quality, but what can you do for $19.99\/person. It's a sweet deal. Service was highly disorganized, where you'd ask for your bill to the server, but some lady would come with an iPad to do this transaction separately. I get that each person has a role, but, it took about 15 minutes for us to get the bill, and as they charged for 4 people instead of our head count of 3, we waited for another 10 minutes for them to correct their mistake. 

Since they have barely opened, and are still short-staffed in comparison to the demand, there was a lot of chaos, disorganization, and some confusion, which I assume will be figured in time. I think most important is that even if the organization were resolved, I wouldn't go back due to the quality of the meats and food being average.",5,5,5

It's about 15 minutes away from the strip. The location was difficult to find because they are connected to the mall. So your GPS might say go inside the mall it's actually not. It's near red robin and chevy's. 
The time we arrived it was about lunch. They weren't as busy so we were seated right away. Once you are seated all the side dishes is ready and their service 5 star. They took our order pretty fast. The downside was that we didn't get our appetizer first the main meats and dishes came out before the appetizer which was okay had food in front of us to munch on. The food was excellent. We didn't care so much for their premium steak so I wouldn't advise to get that even if you are a steak lover, it was really bland. I would recommend to order from all the ""thumbs"" up listed on the menu. Their price is different on the weekend so on the weekend their lunch price is dinner price and the 14.99 is only valid on the weekdays. Overall, I would come visit this place again, their service is excellent as well as their food and the cool part is that once you pay you actually get your card back because they come to you to slide your card.",2,2,2

We arrived a little after 8PM and checked in to wait for a seat. We were told 20 - 30 minute wait and they took my number to text me once our table was near ready. We were called to our table and all seemed to be going smoothly. 

We were seated, ordered water and a sprite. We were given info about how the restaurant works and whatnot. Our server brought our drinks, followed moments later by someone else bringing another Sprite - lack of communication, not a big deal. I'd rather have 2 than none. They start you out with banchan waiting at the table. The Oi (cucumber) kim chee was good, I don't really care for the other sides, which seems a waste to start them at the table instead of letting people order them. 

We ordered 4 meats. Spicy pork (one of my favorites), chicken, beef bulgogi, and the closest thing they had to kalbi. The meats were brought out - they put the beef bulgogi down and told me it was spicy pork (BIG difference both in taste and looks) - the beef bulgogi was actually non-spicy pork, the chicken was garlic chicken, and the other beef order was possibly correct. When I asked about the spicy pork, the server didn't really seem to know what I was talking about. He went and checked with the kitchen and then returned to get the correct meat out. We then later discovered that the beef bulgogi for my husband was the pork (which he doesn't eat). It took forever to have someone check on us so we could ask about the mix up. It was replaced fairly quickly, but the rice had already gotten cold waiting for the meats. I also ordered edemame, which never arrived. 

We ate the food, which was rather bland. The spicy pork had some flavor due to the spicy, but the rest of the meats did not have the traditional korean flavors. The best tasting part of the meal was actually the Oi. Our server checked on us a total of one time, about 5 minutes after the food came out, to see if we wanted more food. They charge if you have leftovers on the plates, so we wanted to wait until we had actually had some food to eat. Good thing I don't eat that much anymore, because he NEVER came back! We ran out of meats, I never got the edemame (though we did randomly get a salad we didn't order?) and we ran out of drinks. After waiting for a LONG time, we realized we had been there nearly an hour and had been served ONE serving... seriously? We waited for the check. And waited. And waited. 

I heard the table next to us call someone aside ""hey bro, who's our server, we'd like to order"". So, it wasn't just us being neglected. We waited a couple more minutes for the check, which never arrived. I got up and the husband followed. We walked toward the doors and were wished a good evening. Honestly, I was tempted to just leave, but I'm not that kind of person. We could have walked out without paying and no one would have known. Not a great business model.

We asked if we could pay, and the girls up front looked confused. I explained the situation and the manager was called over to speak with us. We explained it again, spoke with the manager for a few moments, paid our bill and left. 

For nearly $50, I would rather go down to SURA for more flavor, better service (serve yourself from the food bar) and only a few dollars more per person. Honestly, I doubt we'll be back. I know the husband is not willing to go back at all. Hopefully they can use this as a training experience, but that still wont fix the lack of flavor.",10,2,1

My friends and I are from out of town and were looking for any korean bbq AYCE places in Las Vegas. We came across Gen Korean bbq and we couldn't believe it was only $20 for AYCE because on the east coast, its always $30+. 

The menu is very generous and you can choose a lot of different things from the menu. We always get the pork belly because we normally judge the restaurant based on the freshness of the pork belly and the beef. There were different choices for the pork belly and we tried every single one and it was all very delicious. I'm actually use to having lettuce for wraps (to wrap your meat around) for korean bbq so i'm not sure if that salad they give you cuts it...even though it was good as well.  I also wish they had more side dishes and gave you more kimchi initially. I'm assuming thats for costs reasons so they don't waste food so i KIND OF understand why they do that. But AUTHENTIC korean restaurants, gives you about 8 side dishes for your tatsting initially. Happy hour starts at 9:30 and we tried different flavors of soju. The yogurt soju was delicious even though, they water it down A LOT...which is kinda a turn off. 

But honestly, the best part of the meal was our server, Terry. I have NEVER met a server that was so down to earth and friendly as Terry. He was SO attentive and quick on everything that me and my friends were very ""wow"" by his performance. We gave more than 25% tip because of his service and friendliness. We even went up to the manager and told him how excellent this server is and how he REALLY deserves a raise. We honestly came back two days after because of Terry and his service (and the food) :) 

I highly suggest you request Terry as your server because you won't regret it.",2,2,2

The types of meat, the quality and cuts of meats are pretty different here.  I'll give this Gen an extra star for having more choices of non-marinated meats.  However, the quality of meat is just not the same here.  It's definitely fattier than I remembered it to be, much slower service. Once happy hour hit, the kitchen stalled for an entire 20 minutes for some reason and ran out of rice.   

The brisket and roast beef were okay and the most disappointing of it all is, they don't carry any variety of short ribs any longer.  I didn't see any pork cheeks either, plus they ran out of tofu soup and I guess they don't make it after they run out at 9 p,m for dinner.

There was a pretty good amount of people but we were seated in about 5 mins. It's located in Galleria Mall so we were quite excited that it was somewhat close to us considering we live in the Henderson area. I should have noted that before we stepped inside this establishment. Most of the menu was catered towards the dominant American population's taste.

I don't know what they consider ""premium"" but the meat was definitely not authentic. The pork belly was not black pork belly usually used at other kbbq restaurants. The chadol aka thinly sliced beef brisket was two or three times thicker than it should have been making it less savory, more dry and lean. Note that the bulgogi used the same thickness of meat. 

They had no boricha (korean tea),  gochujjang (red pepper paste), steamed egg, and soybean soup. Knowing  we paid $20 a person for three people and that some of the essentials in a kbbq dinner were unavailable made our dining experience very very unsatisfying. We could have paid less at another place at ala carte price and still have left completely satisfied. 

It was nice to note that the bar actually has grills installed in it. The grill itself throughout the place seemed to burn too quickly however.

We came in around 3 pm, they only had a few tables but we were asked to wait for a table, not a big deal, just a little curious since they had lots of tables open and enough staff walking around. We were greeted by our server immediately and drinks were brought out quickly. 

Typical of other AYCE places there are lunch price ($16) and dinner ($22) I think. Dinner you get tongue and two other types of meats. 

Only 3 stars compared to other AYCE places because:
-No soup and no steamed egg on the menu
-No tongue on the lunch menu ( in my opinion tongue is very basic for Korean BBQ, they should include tongue in the lunch price)
-They give very small amount of the sides...when I say small I meant teeny tiny...like they are serving barbie sized food - it was annoying having to constantly ask for more sides and waiting quite a long while for re-fills 
-They do not offer to change the grill until you ask them to
-Meat was ok nothing impressive, even the marinated ones were decent, nothing stood out

A few pros are that:
-Server was very nice and friendly
-They offer more variety of seafood than other places
-The vent sucks the smoke down to the bottom instead of sucking the smoke upward like other places so we did not smell like a BBQ pit leaving the place - this is a great pro if you plan on going somewhere after the meal so you don't have to smell like meats 

If you are in the area or watching the wallet this is a pretty good place for Korean BBQ. I personally would rather pay a few more bucks to get tongue, steamed egg and soup!",0,0,0

We ordered the all you can eat Korean BBQ style.  The ingredients for the BBQ did not taste right or I should say not fresh.  The pork belly tasted stale like it just came out of a year long freeze.  The shrimp tasted like mud with a lingering after taste.  I guess you suppose to drenched them in a sauce before you eat them. The service was less than OK.  Waiters forgetting our orders and never came back to check on water until we asked.  We had to go to the cashier to pay our bill because the waiter never came back with the bill when we asked.

By wonky, I mean we arrived about 9:50 pm and were told we had a 10 to 20 minute wait. During our wait, we observed multiple tables which sat empty, waiting for their place settings and when they did get their place settings, they sat people down but you could tell there was a disconnect between the clean up and set up crews. The hostess was doing her best to get people seated and the place was packed with people waiting. It felt like they were short staffed overall.

As soon as we sat down, the waiter took our drink order and plugged it onto their pos system. They took our app and meat order as well. Our food showed up first so we started cooking it and the waiter came back to check on us, but we hadn't received our drinks yet. He went back in and apparently our drinks were sitting on a tray waiting for someone to bring them out.

We ordered more food and had someone else's food show up, it was the table next to us. We think the rest of our food showed up, but by then we were decently full. Then our waiter just disappeared. It looked like they took people from the front of the house and pulled them into the back of the house to clean up. Another waitress refilled our drinks and she brought us our checks.

Usually the place is on par from our previous visits, but tonight was really quirky. Not sure if we'll be back until things get smoothed out again.",0,0,0

We were told to wait 20 minutes at first, then told to wait 30, which is no problem. We ended up waiting for an hour, which we also didn't mind because it was Sunday night but when we arrived it was empty and by the end of our wait, we've seen multiples parties with groups as large as ours get seated before us. 

We were then told that our party of 8 was going to be spilt into 2 tables back to back. After waiting an hour we weren't just going to walk out. 2 tables next to each other opened up and we asked to be sat there. The hostess said ""ok, let me check for you."" We wait another 15 minutes on top of the hour that was originally supposed to only be 20 minutes, only to be sat at 2 tables, back to back. Meanwhile, one of the other 2 tables that were next to each other was given to a party of 7 that showed up after us.

Already upset about this, the table that 4 of us were sitting at started leaking in the ceiling above the table (it was raining out). So now that half of the group had to move to a table even further from the other half. 

We saw our server twice, three times maybe. We ended up ordering the majority of our food from the runners who were dropping off our orders or cleaning the table. 

We chose your restaurant as a going away celebration for a friend moving to another country and now instead of spending it with 7 friends, the going away celebration was spent with just 3. No free meals or free desserts are being seeked for compensation. The plans along with the night have already been ruined. As a last get together for a friend, this is what the 8 of us will remember.

The only reason why I even gave 2 stars is because the food was delicious.",1,0,1

They put our party of seven at a table so small, they had to add a chair to the end of the table. Plus, the wait staff was extremely rude, and it took a long time to order and get our meat. After sitting there starving, and finally getting our meat, we then found that their grill was S-L-O-W!  We told two regular employees about the grill (with no resolution), then asked for the manager, and was given the ""assistant"" manager (still no resolution).  You only get a certain amount of time to eat there, and our wait staff told us that we had to have our last order in by 11:00. After complaining more, and more waiting, we finally got the ""real"" manager, Eugene Kang, who was the rudest, and argued with us about the wait time, and told us that the wait staff did NOT tell us that 11PM was the cutoff time (untrue, and unless he was at the table, how could he know what seven people heard), arguing about the cooker, etc., and more and he was VERY CONFRONTATIVE.  It was readily apparent that he was enjoying his position of power at that restaurant. It was embarrassing, and my daughter wanted to be away from everyone seated near us.  When she stood up, HE STOOD IN FRONT OF HER AND PHYSICALLY BLOCKED HER!!! She was so intimidated that she called the police, and a report was made, resulting in one of those little white cards explaining rights to victims of crimes.  Even after all of this, the manager was lying, stating that we ordered 22 orders of meat and had eaten all of them but one, when there was a grill full of uncooked meat at the table, and more meat raw on the table that could not be put on the grill. At least two of us had a very tight throat, two of us had the runs after eating there, and at least one of us still has a cramped stomach, two days later.  What we can gather, is that the food cooker is slow so that not a lot of meat can be cooked.  The entire staff was rude, and when I went to pay for mine so I could leave (I thought I was going to have to get medical care due to my stomach cramping and tight throat), there were three employees at the register who were smirking.  After the police came, the rest of our party left and were not made to pay, but I still AM PAYING even two days later, with stomach cramping.  Overall, this is a horrible establishment with staff that is RUDE, and it is VERY apparent that they don't care about their customers.  Don't go there.  There are many other ""real"" Korean BBQ's in town that DO CARE, cost less money, and appreciate their patrons.

Apparently they don't have any lunch specials for the weekends so we were forced to pay the all you can eat dinner price. Which was fine considering you have the option of a lot of different menu items. 
Let's just say the food was awful. Not worth the price at all. The slices of chicken they give you to cook are large and misshapen, very hard to cook on an open flame, no knife to cut them up to make sure that each area of the chicken was fully cooked.  This would be fine if we were eating beef, but chicken is very dangerous to potentially eat raw. I found myself biting around areas of chicken to make sure it wasn't raw. 

The side dishes that are already at your table when you arrive look like they've been sitting out all afternoon. And they don't remove the plates that your raw food comes on so you're basically sitting next to raw poultry juice all while eating your meal. The food that you can order that's already cooked clearly looks like it's been sitting out as well. 
Also the restaurant is just generally filthy, bus tub (dish carts) everywhere. And food crumbs on the seat and floor.

Brisket
Bulgolgi
Beef tongue

That is where I originally tried it out the first time years ago even though of course there are Korean BBQ places all over. 

Las Vegas is a place I do not go to very often. But it was the second time I have been in the area and someone whom I know was kind enough to show me a great place he had already eaten twice at (within the span of two weeks ) previously. 

The premise of Korean barbecue is that you basically pay to cook your own food. But it is the price and experience that being people to come back to places like this. The menu of meat is extensive at most restaurants. This was no different. There is a lunch special during the week for all you can eat but the price is different during the weekend. 

The place has a good energy and modern fusion look in the decor. Many tables with booth style seating ( what we were offered ) or a large sit down bar area. The wait was not too long as there were five in our group. As soon as we were seated the hostess let us know that even though it was lunch time, the dinner price was what was available during the weekend. It was still a good deal for the amount of food we ended up ordering. The different in price was approximately $5 but there was a reason why our friends ate here at least twice ( which they normally would not ). 

The banchan put out and our server let us know the special appetizers that were available. Popcorn chicken, Korean fried chicken ( which is touted as the new KFC ) spicy pork bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chadol, steak, chicken bulgogi and some bovine intestine (gobchang). The last dish everyone politely declined to try. 

Dessert options. While waiting for a table at the beginning I noticed a large waist height display freezer full of macrons. But these were not regular dessert macrons. They were filled with ice cream. Four main flavors were available but I only ordered while another one in our party decided to try one. I decided to get the mango and chocolate flavor.  

There is a good assortment of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I did not partake but they have both sake, soju, wine and different beers. 

Overall service was excellent. They were attentive and even took time to explain that we were able to adjust the heat for cooking. This was important as some meats required more or less heat. 

They accommodated babies but I did not like that the baby chair was on the outside of the booth. Customers and employees kept walking by and out of curiosity there were many attempts to grab the food as it was put on the table. But there were no issues and the employees were careful. 

They separated the bill for each person which made my group happy. This is a spot I would not mind visiting again.",3,3,3

The first time I went into Gen BBQ I asked if they had any a la carte options since I am vegetarian. The hostess (I believe the lead) said ""we only do all you can eat"". I asked if I could just order a few things off the menu and she said no and was not very understanding about it. I was disappointed because my boyfriend really wanted to go. The second time, I decided to get the regular all you can eat menu and just eat vegetables, I asked if we could sit at the bar (so my boyfriend and I could have different grills). Again, without listening to the fact that I am vegetarian, she said no because no one was serving at the bar. I said I did not want to order drinks, just food, and she said a server could not take my order over there. She was not compensating and I don't think she even listened to my question. My boyfriend and I sat at the same grill, and she failed to communicate to the server that I did not eat meat and every time my boyfriend ordered a meat portion the server would assume two orders and brought us TONS of meat. I ordered a bottle of sake, and the server did not serve it with a glass. Just the bottle itself. The food is bland and the dressings seem to not be helpful enough to sustain its flavor on the VERY hot grill. The atmosphere is nice and has a electric blue undertone which makes the vibe of the place comfortable. Unfortunately, the service was not good and the food was bland. Don't order too much food (or make sure the server doesn't bring out two of everything, in my case!) note: they will charge you for uneaten food. I will say, if you eat meat, and are okay with paying a hefty price for prices of average meat, this might be the place for you.",0,0,0

There is a coupon that offers $20 off of $40. This coupon is available online and says ""valid if printed"".

I waited another 30min, before the waiter came back with the hostess and said they were sorry, but they no longer accept this coupon. I asked to speak with a manager.

I told them that I had already spoken to a manager earlier and he had told me that this coupon was OK! But now, after waiting more than an hour for a table and an hour more just to pay, the bill was $20 more?! 

Instead of allowing us to pay and leave with the understanding that in the future the printed coupon would not be accepted, the manager simply said it was out of his hands because it was a decision that corporate had made. BS

Please ignore the people who proclaim this is the best AYCE or Korean BBQ they've ever had.  It's not even close to that -  I would say it's the worst in Vegas.  

Pro's - cheap, 20 bucks, a lot of variety to choose from, and while you wait you can kill time in the mall and dl an app that shows you your place in line which is updated frequently 

Cons - oh boy.....

Gimmicky and lacks any Korean culture\/experience.  Waiters aren't knowledgable of food.  You can only order 4 orders of meet and they are TINY portions.   We must have placed a good 5-6 orders.  A plate of brisket will have 9-10 pieces.  Everything you pretty much have to ask for like sesame sauce, rice.  They don't offer rice paper or lettuce. 
The meats are average at most.  A few of the apps were frozen.  I could go on....

To be fair, I'm not going to compare this place to my spots in Cali because Gen doesn't stand a chance for many reasons. On that note, I think it's common knowledge that the kbbq scene in Las Vegas is pretty weak and leaves much to be desired. Sorry, but it's true.

Enter Gen House. First impression: Ohh my my my.. The atmosphere is definitely chic, like something you should come to expect for a kbbq spot in Las Vegas (I know it's in Henderson, but whatever). Gen is centrally located in a mall, so parking is of no issue. Waiting in line, however, can be sporadic, much like most kbbq places.

Like I said earlier, I can't compare this place with my spots in Cali, but I can, however, compare the service. Enter Jaenica (heart and music note). She was simply amazing; I couldn't ask for a better server. Seriously, she's the best, I can't emphasize that enough. She catered to our needs very quickly and was very entertaining to talk to--cute, too.

There's nothing much to say as far as the food goes, other than that it was pretty standard for what you would expect for a ayce kbbq. Nonetheless, I do have two gripes: kimchi and bean sprouts. I don't even know where to begin, but of all the sides, kimchi reigns supreme and should not be compromised. The ones we got were watery and were mainly the rooted end of the cabbage--very disappointing. On the other hand, the bean sprouts, second in line to the throne, is missing in action! Where are my bean sprouts?! Seriously, Gen, get it together.

All things considered, I definitely recommend this place for your ayce kbbq needs. This is the spot in Vegas, hands down, no doubt about it. Still in all, I'm inclined to give Gen only 3 stars because of the kimchi and bean sprouts ordeal.

I mean if you're a Cali person (like myself) then you know what good quality beef at a Korean bbq restaurant tastes like. I've eaten at other Kbbq joints in Vegas and this is NOTHING like those average places. Gen Korean BBQ House has premium quality beef and meat! Did I mention, it's all YOU can eat for a great price! The service is on point. Everyone from servers, to bussers, to the meat delivery staff, and the hostess are all so friendly. I will admit when my husband and I first walked into this place, it was super busy the hostess told us there was an hour wait. We were pretty bummed out by the wait but we decided to stay because this location is kinda far from our house since it is located in Henderson. Aside from the wait time, the food was  scrumdiddlyumptious! We came for dinner which is only $20 for all you can eat Korean BBQ PLUS all you can eat appetizers. How great is that? Such a good deal & so much food for a great price. I'm super stuffed! Our server, Yuhao aka Howard, was a friendly young gentleman. He was helpful, answered all questions, even noticed when our drinks & rice needed a refill! I'm very pleased with such great staff members for a premium Korean BBQ location. We will definitely be back and this will be our go to spot now that we live in Vegas! We didn't eat kbbq for about a year since we moved here and now that'll all change :) 

Dishes I recommend were:
Beef brisket
Beef bulgogi
Marinated premium steak

Dishes we ordered were :
All the recommended ones &&
Spicy chicken
Cajun shrimp 
(Those ones weren't as delicious & shrimp takes too long to peel off when you just want to stuff your face!)

Appetizers we ordered
Fried Gyoza
Popcorn shrimp (delicious!!)",5,5,5

We were seated promptly at a booth, which was very spacious given the extra ledge on the top. I think Korean BBQ places are always lacking table space since there's so many plates.

Our server, Ozzy, totally made our experience at Gen memorable.  He was very attentive and always came by right when we needed him to order more dishes. He had great recommendations and everything was delicious.

Coming from LA, I was so happy to see that Gen had made its way to us from Henderson. We had the dinner menu, and we got to have all you can eat appetizers in addition to the meat. The only downside is that they ran out of the seaweed salad, but there was plenty of other food to make up for it.

Must get: galbi, bulgogi beef, signature pork steak, bulgogi chicken, japchae

Good: chadol (brisket), bulgogi pork, garlic chicken with cheese fondue (interesting), fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, grilled veggies

Probably not again: fried squid legs, Cajun shrimp (too much work to peel)

As with any AYCE Korean BBQ, there are plenty of side dishes, rice paper, salad, rice, etc to accompany your meat. The staff was very attentive our your needs and changed our grill pretty frequently. The thing I love about Gen is the small portion size.  We were able to try so many things with just the four of us.

We also enjoyed reverse happy hour towards the end of our meal. We could mix two flavors of soju, our favorite was the Peach\/Yogurt recommended to us by Ozzy. We also tried strawberry\/mango and pina colada\/yogurt which were good too. All of them are pretty sweet as soju drinks usually are. Overall, we'd definitely visit again!",4,2,3

Meats were not marinated or presented well-incredibly bland and not of good quality. I want to say they have tried to make this place mainstream and by doing so made kbbq terrible. For example, they had bloody French fries and fricken nacho cheese garlic chicken in their menu-it'd be fine if it was good but it was really just awful.

All the really good waiters got promoted and their replacements are appalling. We had the ""pleasure"" of having Julian as our waiter last night. Completely unapproachable and inattentive. We would wait patiently for refills, reordering, etc but would end up flagging someone else down because we were ignored by Julian after our first order. We would see him roaming the restaurant, chatting it up with other waiters. We eventually saw him not even in uniform anymore cleaning the restaurant, everyone was. My friends and I also work in the service industry, so we completely understand cleaning when you can so you can close. But the restaurant wasn't closing for another 50 minutes! The hostess asked if she could take our payments so she could close the register (almost an hour before close...ok?). Whatever, no big deal. But no surprise, after she took our money, we received ZERO service. We weren't even done eating! I had to go up to the hostess to ask for a simple refill of our water because we still had food left to eat and no waiters to be seen.

I guess based on my experience with new businesses opening, it's not always a good idea to do a review during the first month.  They really did a complete turn around each experience after.  

So the rule of only being able to order just a certain amount of items at a time doesn't apply anymore.  In fact you can order as much as you want.  What I really love about this place is it it comes in a smaller portion size, which is still a good shareable amount, but it's not overwhelming to the point where you would get full off one order.  By ordering small, you get more opportunity to try more dishes!

Also, the ""hood system"" has greatly improved.  No more issues with the burner going out.  

All their marinated meats are perfectly marinated, especially their bulgogi.  It comes with regular sliced onions as well as green onions, which makes it all better.  They offer rice or rice paper, and sesame oil is available.

The ice cream green tea macarons make the perfect dessert.",8,5,7

So we finally trekked across town (40 minute drive) to give it a shot.  After we got there we knew there would be a wait but it was another hour! OMG this had better be good.

We were finally called and sat down.  The first part of there service seemed slow, we asked for water and a few things to start but it was our first time so we need some time for the rest.  By the time we ordered our next round our first round had not come yet...  All in all I think is was just a really busy night and the lull slowed them down a bit, pretty understanding of that.  When it did come it is small portions so it is good for the AYCE setting but please don't under estimate or they will charger you for not eating.  We paced ourselves, one if the things I really liked is the variety of meat they had.  I am a Bulgogi so give me that with one other thing and I am happy.  Here I tried so many things it made the experience fun for me again.

The different kinds of meat I tried was great, the service was great, some of the appetizers were good.  A few downfalls in my mind is they seved the lettuce chopped on the side (like a salad) I like to warp my BBQ in lettuce with all the toppings.  They were also missing the soybean sauce one of my favs but because they serve the lettuce chopped it wouldn't matter anyways.  They do have a Radish wrap our friend loves my man liked it I am not a fan but that is only because I don't like radish, so that has nothing to do with the restaurant.  The other wrap he loved was a rice paper wrap.  I tried it was amazingly difficult to work with and all my food fell out anyways (horrible), not a fan but whatever that is a personal choice.

I am still giving 4 starts because all the things I disliked besides the lettuce wrap and the soybean sauce was a personal choice.  The restaurant is Really good the meant is great and some of the specialty meat is absolutely amazing!  I like the small serving sizes because it is an AYCE they portion it on the small side so you can eat more kinds!  

All in all, Great service, Good timing, could be a bit better expelling the menu if new even if our friend has been, food delivered quickly after the first lull, flavor of the meat and cuts of meat very good!  Could add non chopped lettuce, could add soybean sauce. 

Pretty good stuff I might be back if on this side of town again!  If I lived on this side, well 100%",3,0,2

My first visit was cool, good enough for this restaurant to get a second visit from me. 
It is not really traditional Korean food. They do have the meats and the flavor of those meats have hints of Korean flavor, but its clear that their goal is for you to throw on the feedbag and chow down. It is clear that they are not interested in their patrons enjoying an authentic Korean culinary experience. I can accept that. No gochujang? Ok, It's like the ketchup of Korean and you don't have it. Might as well just have the ban chan be dill pickles and olives.

My second visit had me fuming. I had a coupon and showed it to the waitress. She said ok and told me to give it to her when the bill came around. The meal was uneventful, aside from the shame of no gochujang. The bill came via the manager and I provide my coupon. He tells me they do not accept it anymore. I point out that it is not expired and I did show it to the server; she did not alert me to what he is telling me now. The manager tells me that they do not accept the coupon anymore, nothing he can do, it came down from corporate. I pointed to the waitress and said she told me to just give the coupon to her when the bill comes. The manager told me that staff is new, they are not trained.

Long story short, they did not honor my coupon. What made me angry was that the manager was argumentative and made no accommodation for the situation. No apology. The server essentially accepted the coupon when I showed it to her (as the coupon stated) and then the manager said J\/K... ha ha.

But like I said briskets + mashed potato is the best thing ever. Oh may I add that I like to dip this with the sesame oil with salt instead of just the salt.

Per usual, the experience is great. My last visit was tip top, thanks to ALODIA. It wasn't too busy that time, we just missed the lunch price! She came back to our table a few times to constantly check if we were doing okay. I don't really ask for much in service as long as my food is bomb.com but since we have so many plates of meat all at once, our table was always clear of plates we don't use.

Let's start by saying, the atmosphere was very nice, upscale and clean.  I've spent 20 years immersed in the Korean culture spent a considerable amount of time in Korea and attending Korean events, this restaurant is hit for the most part. There are a couple things that aren't right and that's why they didn't get a 5 star. Let's start with what was amazing, the beef tongue was unbelievable, we ordered that 5 times, the steak was out of this world for the price and quality. The first waiter we had started waiting tables for the first day when we arrived, so he wasn't very good and seemed very confused as to what to bring to the table. We needed to ask for a bowl of rice otherwise it would have been protein overload. The one thing I didn't like about Gen's is, they don't have the traditional leaves to wrap your rice, meat and bean paste in. I asked for it and I got radish wraps, they are tasty but very small. Next time I go back I'll be bringing romaine lettuce from my local Sam's Club. The waiter all though he was new, was not a big deal, he was trying something new in his career and I think that deserves a little patience as he learns. The lack of romaine lettuce to wrap my cook protein, rice, bean paste and fresh garlic was a bum deal. I'm assuming the restaurant will work this out eventually and will probably offer a better wrap later. Overall the restaurant was very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try a Korean BBQ, it's fun, inexpensive and a nice night out.",0,0,0

Our server took forever to get our orders. He made alot of mistakes.. 1st we want 2 miso soup and gave us 1, japchae we ordered never came but when we follow it up they were no more!! Our drinks never get refilled.  Server didn't even bother to drop by and ask if we need to order again. Our pans are so dirty that the food tasted burnt. We asked for a replacement but it took awhile as well. Servers cant be found anywhere. 

The food is ok, there were other korean restaurant i have been that are way better especially when it comes to customer service.

To manager, you gotta teach your employees customer service because its not about the food alone but how you keep your customers taken care off. 

Its very frustrating because its a new place but due to the bad customer service, i wont come back and i wont recommend it either",2,0,0

The food here was very good and the service was fantastic. they had the tables with the side dishes set up before we even got there which was new because more Korean restaurants don't do this normally. They were able to bring out our meat dishes fairly quickly and took away our finished dishes as well. The kfc and the fried squid legs were surprisingly good. Wasn't expected that from a kbbq place. My server Eugene was extremely helpful and friendly. He frequently came to our table to see if we needed anything and when we did, he was very prompt in getting what we needed. This was a surprising and appreciated service I received compared to other kbbq restaurants. Thank you for the great service Eugene",2,2,2

When you walk inside you are met with the aroma of cooking meat, sizzling sound everywhere, lots of people talking, and the modern interior. I personally like the hustle and bustle aspect of the restaurant. 

Every time I have went I did have to wait about 5-10 minutes each time because it always seems to be busy every night. My favorite place to sit is in the booth, there seems to be more table room which is handy since you'll have plates everywhere. The food selection is fairly large. Mainly just meats and the sides tend to be rice. The food is good if you can cook it right. I do feel sick a little after though, but that's because I try to stuff as much as I can into my stomach.

The service is where the cons come in. There are a lot of young people working and they aren't as friendly and excited to serve you as compared to other restaurants. They are very forgetful as well. I should not have to ask for another bowl of rice three times. Also they never seem to remember what drink you had. The service isn't completely terrible but I have had better. Another annoyance is that they always try to give us someone else's food at least three times a sitting. 

The atmosphere, good. The food, good. The service, eh.",1,0,0

The servers were polite. If I have any critiques, the consistency of service. My guest and I along w the people we sat next to were waiting for sometime before we were asked for our orders or refill of our drinks. 
But Jaenica (heart)(musicnote) went above and beyond to make sure that was changed, and that we were well taken care of for the rest of the time she noticed  the mishap.

My husband and I decided to try Gen for dinner tonight, and I'm glad we did! The wait was long (30+ minutes on a Monday evening at around 7:30pm for a table for two), but our server, Lisa, totally made up for it. She patiently and pleasantly explained how everything worked and made recommendations for us newbies. We really enjoyed the marinated steak, and my husband loved the pork belly (the garlic and the red wine flavors). I wasn't a fan of some of the unseasoned, thinly cut beef options, but my husband seemed to like them. Lisa provided awesome service and was so nice, which really made the evening for me, especially being more than a little nervous to try this new type of dining experience.
