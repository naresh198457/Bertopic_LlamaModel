We got there around 530ish on a saturday night for the seafood dinner buffet. The line was pretty much a HUGE crowd of people all the way down to the bathroom area. The wait looked like about 3 hours for dinner. How horrible!! Luckily, someone in our party had a comp dinner so we got to go to the SHORTER line!!! YAY! We ended up waiting 1 hour rather then 3! 

The dinner is $29.99 for a seafood buffet and drinks (alcohol included!). I tried pretty much everything this buffet had to offer. There's crab, raw oysters, sushi, prime rib and lots of hot\/cold food. Sometimes the food was pretty hit and miss, but overall everything was delicious. The dessert was so tasty and very pretty to the eye. 

Even though this place was pretty busy, I felt like the waiter got us our drinks, napkins, etc in a very timely manner. 

This buffet has quantity and quality! It is definetly worth the wait.  I wanna drive all the way back to vegas just to have this buffet. BEST buffet I have ever been to!",4,1,2

Suddenly then I walk into the buffet and then it seems like I was there for the first time visiting again.  The same memories that my friends have being there, come flooding back; And then for a moment, that I forget that I live in Vegas.  I grab some prime rib, mashed potatoes, crawfish and crab legs.  I make a run for the oxtail stew and the roasted lamb.  Then I make myself an early thanksgiving plate with turkey and all the trimmings.  Finally, I finish with an affogato for desert and sit back and reminisce.

Take advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine area. Or if you're like me, all you can drink root beer :P. What stands out the most to me is the dessert area.

The overall quality is A+, selection is A+, and the desserts would get 10 stars in my book.

I went for the Saturday night buffet - I think seafood is only on the weekends and I loaded up on the crab legs.  Other items I had were the meatloaf, braised short ribs, turkey, stuffed turkey, some pasta, veggies and so on. 

I just wanted to make sure I had enough room for the best dessert bar I have ever seen.  I enjoyed chocolate mousse shooters, tiramisu shooters, the phenomenal ice cream selection (rum raisin, cookies n' cream), some carrot cake, cheesecake... I can go on and on.

To top it off there was a wine bar\/beer area - the M Lager was very good.

I think I started the buffet at 145 pounds and left at 150+.

The only bad thing is the wait - I got there at around 5:30pm and didn't get seated until 6:30pm.

A solid buffet with a couple of very good items, but it's not the finest buffet Vegas has to offer either. But at only $25.95 for a weekend seafood dinner with unlimited seafood and wine, it's a steal and worthy of a visit for sure if you can trek out over there!

The good stuff
+ GREAT prime rib! One of the best I've ever had!
+ Deliciousss BBQ pork ribs, I got seconds on that!! 
+ Ahi tuna salad - omg. amazing.
+ Shrimp were bomb
+ Unlimited wine at no additional charge! Wish i had taken more advantage of this!

The downside:
- Wayy out of the way from the strip. Best for a trip either on your way in\/out of Vegas as a first or last stop!
- Everything other than the meats I tried were kinda meh. Nothing was too memorable.
- There was no lobster when I came for a Friday diner :( what's up with that!!
- They oysters looked gross and I did not even want to test them out. Tear!
- The desserts weren't too impressive at all. I usually have to stop myself from chomping through a whole plate, but here there were few where I even wanted to eat the whole thing. I did finish my cookies and cream gelato, though - and there were a lot of gelato options, yum!

The pasta selection was delicious and well cooked. The desserts were absolutely delectable. They do have a fresh pho station, and the food was constantly being changed. I was satisfied with the food overall. 
One of the awkward moments was the amount of servers for the amount of tables they had. It took us 11 minutes to finally get the server (he would run by with stacks on stacks of plates ) and then another 6 min to get my coffee.

We could have paid less at the Rio and gotten more seafood, including lobster.  

The wine and beer station was great!  I hit that station a few times after our very long wait in line!  SMH

THE LINE-  This is why they get the lone star rating.  General buffet line treatment was horrible!  There were no benches lining the wall, and there was space for it!  The VIP line moved quickly, and they had seats in their waiting area (the thought of ""we are the peasants waiting for the remainder of the VIP's food"" ran through my head).  An older woman almost fainted from standing so long.  I'm not that old, but I was wearing 1 inch heals and by the time we were at the front, my shoes were off.  Usually, after you pay the cashier, you get seated a few minutes later.  We ended up waiting an additional 40 minutes after payment and we were only a party of 3.  When we got in the dining area, we noticed the back area wasn't full and a lot of the tables needed to be bussed.

Based on our awful waiting experience, and the fact that they have no handicapped line ( it's a good thing my Autistic son wasn't with us), we give it a piss poor rating.  SHAME ON YOU STUDIO B!!!  PUT SOME BENCHES ALONG YOUR WALL!!!",2,1,1

The crab legs and oysters were extremely fresh, and there was a good selection of different cuisines to choose from.  My only gripe is that the sushi section was very limited.  My favorite part of buffets is the sushi\/sashimi area.  I guess the unlimited oysters and crab legs made up for it though!  One of the best parts of this buffet is the unlimited drinks.

I visited during weekday lunch hour and the line was not very long.  We were seated quickly (~15-20 mins). The dining room itself is very, very grand.  The way they designed makes you feel that you are surrounded by foods, in a good way (Foods were easily accessible, you just need to reach your hand out).  I had enough space between me and my neighbors, which is a nice thought.  There's a real studio on site where they film the show on certain dates.  

Service is on the spot.  Our plates were taken out routinely and the drinks were refilled as soon as we finished it.  You can tell the level of service is high here and people do work hard compare to some other buffets on the strip.

* Drinks are free (White\/Red\/Imported Beer) +++ for some alcohol lovers!!

The food:  So many to choose from.  Got the standard world cuisine fare.  I tried at least one bite on most of the items,  more on some particular items.  I have to say the foods were all well presented and the taste is in between above-average to excellent for a buffet restaurant. 

Some of my personal favorites during lunch hours were their fried items (Chicken, Shrimp), steak, italian station, their Ox Tail Soup is phenomenal.  Steak is decent, and I liked their salad and sushi station. Its actually better than some non-Japanese operated Sushi buffet in town!   I also liked the fact they have lots fresh cut fruits so I can get some fibers without cutting \/preparing it.

Dessert station is another highlight of this buffet.  There are so many to choose from.  Cakes, Fruit Tarts, Mousses, Cookies, Macaroons.. They made it infront of you, and this is the same items that are selling at the M resort cafe at the entrance of the Casino area.  I also LOVE their gelato.  Made from scratch daily, 18 flavors to choose from , plus the toppings of your choice.  I tried most of them , and the only place that have smiliar quality in terms of dessert was Wynn, but they don't have as many varities as Studio B buffet, and you are paying much more $ for it. 

Feel stuffed? There's also fresh pressed espresso\/coffee that's made to order!  Whoever designed\/organized this buffet should be awarded for their thoughfulness.  Without this attractive buffet, I think  M resort would lose alot of clients due to their geographic locations (about 10 miles from the strip).

We came here versus going to Bacchanal because it was on our way back to Cali and the line wasn't super duper long. Love it, service was pretty good, but it took awhile for us to get seated and get our drinks ordered, otherwise, the extensive array of food made it almost impossible to try everything. For the most part the food was good, I really enjoyed the beef roast, the pad thai, their sesame chicken. The dessert section was delicious, they had creme brulee, an assortment of mousses, and tiramisu, which I enjoyed the most. The creme brulee was also super yummy. And my friend, who is a fan of flan, said it was probably one of the best flan's she's tasted. Again, I'm not a fan of flan, but anyone who is, may want to definitely come try it. Gelatto was also delicious, but less creamy than the ones I've tasted, I liked the pistachio flavor the most only because they had small bits of real pistachio in it.

They even had a bar where you can order champagne and wine. I got the mimosa, and it was a bit strong for me, luckily I just diluted i with more orange juice. To order drinks, just bring your ID over. Great thing about this place is that you can go to the restroom and come back, the workers don't say anything to people coming and going.

For me I would rather go at night then in the day. We pay $40 per person for the brunch menu, but I feel like there could have been more of an assortment of seafood. The only thing I really enjoyed seafood wise were the mussels with the mayonnaise. Everything else was mediocre for me.",0,0,0

In terms of dessert, I highly recommend their coconut pudding with mango and pineapple sauce topped with raspberry and blueberries! It was so good, I had three of those after my mountains of steak and snow crabs!  It also went well with my cafe lattes!  I also recommend finishing up their draft rootbeer - RootBeer Float style!

Came to check it out because I didn't feel like cooking and my boyfriend plays poker at the M everyday, so my mother and I went to go meet up with him for dinner. Went through the VIP line, but the buffet is pretty small compared to all the others, so it took a while to get seated. They have a really good selection and variety. Some out of the norm range like Hawaiian & Greek. To be honest, I do think it is over priced though. Only reason why we came was because the boyfriend gets like 15% off or something for us and my mother gets free buffet comps all the time for here, but hey, if you have money to spend then go for it. I'm currently pregnant, so I didn't get to try the unl. beer & wine bar, but if your coming to get your drink on, then i guess you can say it's decently priced. Lol. The desert bar was amazing!

having once been a connoisseur of the vegas buffets, i appreciate the value of a well designed layout and variety of cuisine to choose from.  at the end of the day, every buffet will serve the same types of food...carving station, salads, sushi, americanized asian\/italian\/random country with a distinct palate, soups, an occasional seafood feast and dessert.  so it's fair to say that it's difficult to stand out in the buffet world of las vegas.

Friend and I went yesterday, Saturday morning. Short wait, but as soon as we paid, a hostess seated us. She explained the set up, introduced us to our waiter, Izzy, and let us be. Izzy was very kind, pointed out where certain food groups were, and asked us if we wanted water, juice, tea, etc. I opted for hot tea, while my friend went for water. 

I grabbed some desserts first since we were seated right next to the server entry and desserts. My friend went off in search of the seafood. She got enough seafood to make up for my cost of not eating it. Anyway, next was nigiri and caesar salad, since it was safe. There was a pho station by the soups too. Seafood on my friend's plate was smallish, but oysters were huge. She didn't like the ceviche shooter. Fried shrimp was a bit puny and over fried, but still good. Managed to get to the prime rib\/steak area, really good. And the whole time, the staff seemed very nice. Toward the end, my friend got 3 plates of desserts and tried the pistachio gelato. Not a fan of that, but she enjoyed the flan and macarons. I got mini cheesecake with sauce on it, and the tart rolls with pineapple chunk on it...x3. 

Other points to keep in mind, there was truffle mashed potatoes, and lobster Mac and cheese, pizza, and spaghetti. Again, limited on what I can eat, didn't want allergic reaction. Seemed good since my friend got a lot and went back for seconds with the sweet potato mash with marshmallows.

In addition, as long as you are 21+, it is endless alcohol. Friend had 4, I had 2. Plus, a specialty barrista stand for cappucino, espresso, etc.

We ate at least 4x worth what we paid for. Weekend seafood buffet is $43.25 per person after tax. 

We left a fair tip, since Izzy was very accommodating when we asked for things. Meanwhile taking care of a whole 1\/4th of the room and a giant table of 20+ rude people and crazy kids. 

But to me, fair price for what we got. Again, especially for Vegas. The slight upscale and decadence and low din felt nice. Enter at your own risk.",0,0,0

We went late afternoon\/early evening on a Friday. It wasn't very crowded. Most of the food was ok, there were a couple really good dishes, but most were lackluster. The seafood had a very fishy smell and the sushi had the texture of store bought sushi. 

There are warming and cooling dishes, but the prime rib is self serve and food it replenished from the back, nobody preparing and carving food. 

Service seemed scattered and slow, drinks were rarely refilled. They didn't provide spoons with place settings and our waitress had to track some down.

I thought it could have had more variety, pretty pricey. I think the big appeal is free beer and wine, but we aren't huge drinkers and you had to go to the bar to get it. The line was always 10 deep.

-Shrimp Cocktail - fresh and decent sizes
-Orange chicken - decent for buffet
-Assorted Sushi - fresh and liked the salmon
-oysters - VERY VERY Fresh! I was very impressed. Usually I would not eat raw oysters but I was impressed. They have big and small ones. I, myself like the small ones.

First off, the selection and quality of food is incredible!! They have a LARGE selection of various types of foods....including lots of different types of seafood, gelato, and even wine!

As any seasoned buffet diner knows, don't go for the pizza and fried chicken.....but instead, go for the exotic and expensive foods such as king crab legs, clams, mussels, fish, prime rib, etc.

As such, I went around the buffet area and grabbed A LOT of different foods and to my surprise, everything tasted good! The quality really surprised me for a buffet....usually buffet quality food is just MEH, but the food here was outstanding. 

The prime rib was probably the best dish that I had all night. The prime rib was cooked just right, tender and juicy with an appropriate amount of juices retained in the meat.

The gelato bar also had a multitude of flavors and each one of them tasted great. The wine bar was fantastic as well, as you could go up and request any wine and\/or beer that you wanted.

Secondly, the pricing here is reasonable, quite possibly cheaper than the Bellagio Buiffet and the Wynn Buffet!

The only downside to this place is that it is far away from the strip....which means you have to take a long taxi ride here. If I remember correctly, the taxi ride was about $30-$40 bucks one way.

In any case, if you come to Vegas for a buffet, and you have the time, definitely check out this buffet as it surpasses all of the other buffets in Vegas!!",0,0,0

The lines, though, oh the lines. Even during non-peak season, the line is deceiving. While there were no people along the rails, the wait after paying admission took longer than I've remembered.

The Asian food blew donkey nuts and the ahi poke was so bad that our hero actually had to spit it out.  Don't even bother trying the sushi because the rice is rock hard and the fish isn't fresh.  The seafood is pretty average.  The salads were generally good and the meatloaf was delicious.

After gorging on main courses, our hero was disappointed that he didn't leave more room for dessert, as the quality of their sweets beats out the mains by a long stretch.

The best thing Studio B Buffet has going for it is that it has a free beer, wine, and cider station.  Their house brews and PBR aren't exactly even decent beers, but it gets the job done.  When you think about it, the price of admission might be worth it for the beer and wine alone.

After an all you can drink beerfest... good luck getting back to your hotel room.

PROS:
- All you can drink beer\/wine\/cider.
- Very wide selection of food from many nationalities.
- Pretty good price for weekday lunch buffets for the selection it has.

CONS:
- Most of the food that isn't Western style kind of sucks.
- Huge lines at peak hours.
- No discounted rates for having a players card.",5,2,4

Two things save this place.  1.  Free beer\/wine  2.  Desert section with coffee bar coffee.

Without those thing this buffet was avg at best.

Oysters Terrible worst I ever ate.  I have been sick since.  I will spare the gory details but lets just put it like this.  I didn't think one could throw up out of both ends over 10 times.

I wish to god I didn't eat the Oysters.  Word of advice if they look old and taste like metal, spit them out and don't trust them.  I even went back to the Seafood chef and said I think they are bad.  He said I was crazy.  I told him to eat one.  He refused.  I pulled out a Ten dollar bill and said Eat 3.  He still refused.  Wonder why?  He knew these things were toxic.

Crab.  Ate better.

In any buffet, it's usually expected that the quality of the food will not have the same attention as a regular sit down joint because, let's face it, buffet food is cooked in bulk and sometimes quality is lost. I did not experience that with Studio B. Crab Legs were not over cooked, oysters nice and plump, wide variety of pastas and dessert, you can choose from Gelato and various other oven baked goodies! All of the things that I always look for :) BTW, some sugar-free desserts available!

It's a very large Buffet, high ceilings, modernized decor and there's also a seating area that has a view of the Strip. We haven't had any issues with service, plates are cleared and drinks are refilled, usually upon request but I don't knock them for that because most times that we eat there, it's during the peak hours so they're usually running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

At the M Resort we paid about $53 for 2 people and we also got unlimited wine, beer and mimosas which were not part of the Bellagio's deal.

Wine is included (quit trying to seduce me, M.  You had me at self-serve drinks in your casino).  I really liked the turkey, chow mein, and dark chocolate marshmallow bark.

There are about 4 main sections, salad, seafood, American (meat), and asian (chinese, thai, japanese, and hawaiian).  Starting on the right you have a small salad section, with intertingly tabuolleh and grape leaves one table (so thats their middle-eastern section).  Meh.   Next, from the right to the middle, we have a smallish selection of seafood (semi precut crab legs, oysters, shrimp), not too much cjoice but all of them were very fresh and tasty.  I'm usually somewhat sensitive to unfresh seafood.  And everything was very fresh.
Middle was decent American (osso buco, prime rib, rotisserie chicken, and others).   Nothing crazy good but ok.  
From the middle to the left is Japanese (sushi too cold!), Hawaiian, korean, thai, then chinese.

Also, they have alcohol (albeit cheap) but it's pretty good.  I stuck to the white wine (the beers tasted the same, and I can't take red)

I've tried them all, from the Rio's Carnival to Red Rock's Feast buffet.  I rarely find a buffet that doesn't impress me, but that is just what happened at Studio B.  It started off just fine, my girlfriend and I got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice. We got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the buffet and it looked real nice. We were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the city.  Nice.  That was the extent of my satisfaction with this buffet.  
I head to the buffet and I like to scope out all the different types of foods. I first notice that there were no signs above the areas stating the type of culture the food was (i.e. Some places will have a sign or something saying 'AMERICAN' or 'KOREAN').  So I figured I would just have to rely on the signs with the food stating what each item was.  There were none.  Nothing to let me know what food was what.  Didnt know if I was putting Mandarin chicken on my plate or Mongolian pork. Didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.  No labels for the soups.  I just had to assume I knew what I was doing.  So, I grab a few familiar foods (can't go wrong with white rice) and head back to my table, only to find people sitting at it.  Huh? I see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.  Moved us?  WOW! Thats new to me.  So I sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink, we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.  About 10 minutes later (which in Las Vegas buffet time is an hour) I see our waitress loaded with drinks strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.  She begins to hand off drinks to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when I ask her where our drinks were.  She says 'Oh diet? Ok take this one.'  She gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat. 
Now for my second plate.  I want meat so I go to the carving station and look at what they have.  I see the turkey and I approach and ask for a couple of slices (Note: I LOVE Thanksgiving, I love turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy and all that).  I get a couple of slices and look around....um...where's the turkey gravy?  To my chagrin, the cook tells me there is none.  WHAT? You have turkey but no gravy??? 'Ya', replied the cook, 'I don't get it either'.  So what am I supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...there's no stuffing either?  Thats right.  No turkey gravy. No stuffing.  Just dry turkey.  And the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.  I ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was 'Yesterday just about everyone asked that'.  Now I'm losing hope. 
Finally, I begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line like you would see at a cafeteria.  50% of it was flan and when finally reaching the only thing that looked appealing, the gelatto, I asked for some.  The lady presented my scoop and instead of asking, 'Anything else' or 'Is that enough' or anything to the sort, instead she RUDELY tells me to please me along.  I felt like I was in the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld.   Funny thing is I had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings!!! We ate dessert and left for home.  But it doesnt end there.  Our total was about $34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.  However, when we got home and my girlfriend checked her online statement, they had somehow charged her $41!  Ugh...So now we're trying to get this fixed.  
All in all, this was the WORST experience I have ever had at any buffet and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time I would.  Mr. Marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his property to ensure better customer service but last night felt more like he was cutting corners.

We did have to wait for a table for a bit as the hostess was consumed with some big groups that had arrived after us.

The food on the buffet is overall very good but the selection seems limited to me.  There are lots of different cuisines but not a lot of any one thing.

First thing's first: how to avoid the wait. Come between normal lunch and dinner times in the the late afternoon. I came here twice in the last week and the waiting experience was vastly different. Both were on weekdays. The first time I came here was around 4pm and we pretty much walked right in after paying. The second time my group came at 7pm and we ended up waiting 2 and a half hours in the massive beast of a line.

On to the food! The highlights:
-Prime Rib
-Slow Cooked Pork
-Kalbi short ribs
-Chicken Marsala 
(as you can tell, I am a huge advocate of carnivorism)
-Mac and Cheese
-The salads were surprisingly good
-Sushi
-Cider (along with endless beer\/wine)

-Creme brulee
-Strawberry gelato
-Chocolate souffle
-Fruit tart
-The canisters of fruit and cream (not sure what these are called but you'll see what I mean. The ones with pistachio and passion fruit were the best)

The tri tip and sirloin was SOO BOMB! They had it in medium, which is my favorite! It was soo good!!!! Their bbq ribs were also very very good, it was actually my favorite. 

I also got their pad thai in the asian section. OMG the best pad thai I've had ANYWHERE.

The dessert was the perfect ending to my meal. They have their own gelato bar and I got the mango gelato and it was soo good. The flavor was deep, the texture was soo smooth. The creme brulee was crispy on the top and very smooth and milky below the top. I also really liked their panna cotta.

Located inside the newly built M Resort, Studio B Buffet has a very nice structure for their entrance way.  It seems like that they took the time to figure out the set up and how its going to look, once people stands in line.  Even though, it was kind of busy when we got there, at least they got something for us to read, or to look at.  Mainly something to keep us entertained while waiting in line to get a table.  The line was moving quickly, since they had two cashiers to check you in.  Quickly after, they had some one escort us to our table.

The setting was very nice, it look like a big ""C"".  It is very spacious and roomy.  Enough space to move around, and not hit other tables.  But, the buffet line itself, I didn't like the fact that its all on one line.  I like buffet, where you can move around the island and pick something else, when your waiting for another item to be open.  But the fact of people jumping in front of you and you don't want to jump in front of others, seems a bit awkward in a way.  

The selection of the food, is AMAZING.  They have something that I'm sure everyone would love.  Especially a buffet with Sushi, I would eat that all day if  could.  But, going there at a point where its really busy, the food tend to be slim pickings when your up there.  Since everyone is jumping to get what they want, by the time you get to a certain food, some one already grabbed it before you did.  So the cooks were kind of slow to bring out the food.  On the other hand, it was kind of expected, since it was during busy hours.  

The staff, I believe, was absolutely awesome.  From the point of checking with the cashier, to being escorted to our tables, to the waitress who made sure our glass was never empty.  It was very warming that these staff will still smile and say thank you, despite how busy it was.

M is located 10-15 minutes away from the strip.  So be prepared to drive for a little bit.  But once you get there, parking is guaranteed, and the resort is just beautiful.  Once you get through the horrendous line, be prepared for heaven.

I swear this place has over 150 things you can choose from.  And none of this stuff is crap at all.  Everything you get here is either fresh, warm, and all ready for you to eat.  The seafood here is amazing.  The crab legs were fresh and sweet.  The shrimp here was just your typical shrimp, but they were very fresh as well.  The clams here were amazing.  The melted butter was okay, but a nice compliment with the crab legs.  I've been to many buffets, and Studio B's seafood outweighs them all.

I also give them props for the prime rib.  The prime rib was both juicy and tender, best amongst the many buffets I've been to.

This place also has unlimited wine, beer, and champagne.  Is this even possible?  I haven't been to any buffet that does this.  Only at the Studio B buffet.

The dessert here is outstanding.  You think they have those yogurt or ice cream machines? Hell no!  They have gellato! YES...GELLATO!  And it's not crap either.  It's actually VERY good.  They also have a wide variety of desserts that I couldn't even stuff myself with.

And the best part about this is?  It's only $30!!!  Aside from the annoying line, it's worth every penny.  I will go here again once I head back to Vegas.",0,0,0

It's a bit of a drive from the Strip, but in my mind totally worth it.  Studio B offers the same large selections as those more famous buffets in the large hotels on the strip.  But, frankly in my humble opinion, Studio B offers a much better value.  At $~38 for dinner that comes with unlimited wine\/beer on the weekends is already a value.  Throw in dishes that I think are better made and cooked, you've got a winner.  Of course I haven't tried all the Vegas buffets, but Studio B so far is in the lead.",0,0,0

Went for late breakfast which was a good thing since the dessert and coffee bar didn't open until 10:30.  

The regular coffee kinda sucked but their lattes and expressos are made on the spot.  The caffeine rush was mellowed out from the food coma.

Omelette guy did a great job with my veggie concoction.  

Sausages, bacon, hash browns were all good.  Wasn't in the mood, so I stayed away from the fancy stuff this time.

Oatmeal was good too.  Cook was stirring it up as I was approaching that area, so I had to get a big bowl.

lox - you snooze you lose.  The Chinese customers were piling this on their plates like mad, so you better strike first and hard!

pancakes - meh.  been sitting out too long under the heat lamps and developed a hard crust.

macadamia french toast with blueberry topping - this is the preferred way to go.

Studio B hits on multiple levels.  The food selection is right there with The Rio.  Probably not too surprising considering the people behind M Resort also created The Rio 20 years ago.  Italian, Mexican, American, Asian, protein, vegetarian, seafood and dessert.  All of the popular food groups are represented and not just with a taco section or spaghetti.  You'll find multiple dishes for each style of food.  Presentation is also a priority at Studio B.  When lesser buffets almost feel like a school cafeteria, you can see the quality and care from the chefs.  I can't imagine that's an easy task when cooking for hundreds.

You can also tell a lot of thought went into the layout.  Instead of a long, singular spread, the experience is almost Ikea-like in how you get a chance to see everything with seemingly little effort.  All the foods are well marked and well lit.  Plenty of space means it doesn't always feel like a feeding trough.  The decor is very modern and sleek.  There's even a wrap-around video screen although it looks like it's used more for promotion and marketing.  I wonder if they had the capability of showing live sports.  THAT would make this place radical.  There's also a VIP seating area with a great view.  But I think this is probably a better view at night with the strip lit up in the distance.  During the day it's just the undeveloped side of the M Resort grounds.

Final verdict: You can't go wrong.",2,0,1

In a city that is known for opulence, this buffet fits the profile. It's tough competing on a block with so many different hotels\/buffets to choose from (I've dined at most of them), but M resort got it right. They have a wide variety of food selections ranging from traditional American (prime rib, chicken, salads) to more unique options such as Ox Tail soup and Osso Buco. The layout is great with the food centered in the middle with most tables surrounding the entree selections and dessert off to the side. The food is well prepared and tasty...not over cooked and bland like you may find at some buffets that are just looking to serve you mass quantities of blah.

Pros: 
- Lots of food selections
- Unlimited beer, wine, and mimosa
- Clean and 

Cons:
- Long long line (can be up to 1.5 hour wait)
- Off the strip (but worth drive)
- Service can be spotty

DESSERTS! I usually have low expectations for desserts at buffets. They're usually mediocre and the cakes tend to be dry. But not at Studio B buffet!

Positive - Beer and Wine is included in the price. And it isn't horrible.
                  Deserts are great, some of the better Gelato I have had outside of Italy.
                  a lot of choices.
                  The chef was very friendly and eager to assist at the carving station.

The rest of the review - Ok this was a horrible experience from the start.  When we arrived we were sixth in line on a mid week night..  It took us over 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 30 minutes to get seated.  The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).

So we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  

My first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.

Specific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level)

When we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.

The place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1\/2 of in the car.)

Under our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.)

All in all it was a huge disappointment.  I think the majority of people who rate this place high do so because of the free alcohol.

I will not be back here.",10,6,0

I'm a big fan of random buffets and this place is probably one of the best organized in all of Vegas- mind you, it is just outside of Vegas, in nearby Henderson NV, but it's a place where all the locals go. 

The lay out of this buffet is well thought out, there are no weird jams, it's a HUGE lay out and the flow of traffic around the stations are excellent. The egress alone is one to marvel at. They have a show kitchen, and that would a be a cool thing to experience if they ever have cooking demonstrations. 

Really great food, excellent constant refresh of food items and the selection is amazing. There is so much to choose from, there was a Mediterranean station, Italian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Mexican, assorted carving stations, even thanksgiving dinner related station (try the sweet potato mash with the marshmallows... yum)  Ample selection and choices, I was stuffed to the gills after this visit. Save room for desert, because they have gelato and so many teeny tiny bites that are worth the belly space.

They did I mention that they have unlimited Beer and Wine... ummm yes please?

We didn't have any crab legs (went on a weekday for lunch) on the day we visited, but I'm sure they would have plenty of that to go around if we were back on a weekend\/night visit.

1. Open bar . . . that's right, open bar!!! now you can get sloshed not only during sunday brunch, but every meal that you eat here! they serve wines, beer, and a delightful cider

2. Desserts.  this isn't your half assed attempt at dessert done by most buffets.  this is a go-back-for-a-2nd-creme-brulee-even-if-you-feel-sick type of dessert spread (which i did).  They have lots of yummy stuff, most notable is the creme brulee and the gelato!

3.  Selection.  they have so much food there and it's all delicious.  the asian food is notable.  usually, there's a little lame asian section with some orange chicken, a lame attempt at noodles, and teriyaki chicken.  however, the M respects their asian folk and gives us something worth our money.  pad thai, kalbi ribs, very good stir fry, sushi (yes, you heard right, sushi), and my personal favorite - oxtail soup.  it was SO good! 

my boyfriend and i had a great experience here.  the wait is long so be sure to go well before you're hungry.  he absolutely stuffed his face and will go back again every time we're in vegas.",1,1,1

The crab was finger licking fresh
The oyster was sweet and tasty 
Cocktail shrimp didn't need to be shucked
Dessert bar added 2 lbs on my waist
Service was quick and attentive
Prime rib, and red meat selection was better than places like Rio

The buffet is located in M Resort, which is off the strip, but it's a very nice place.  My draw dropped at the price -- $15.  There was no line (it was a Monday after all).  The cashier lady was super nice, and asked if it was our first time (it was mine, not my date's).  She explained that there is a beer and wine bar - all you can drink!

(No thanks though, I'd rather fill up on FOOD)

I'm having trouble recalling the decor in detail, and I didn't really take pics of the place... I remember it being a very expansive dining hall, slightly reminiscent of a very upscale cafeteria.  Sorry, I'm sure that didn't sound appealing, but, like I said, I'm having trouble.

I do remember giant screens with food show clips and commercials (situated above the food counters).

Anyway, I would describe the food as very fresh and flavorful.  I remember thinking each plate was at least decent to very good... none that were a miss.  The selection is smaller than Rio, but the quality more than makes up for it.  I would say it's almost as good as Bellagio's... and considering its price, it has knocked Bellagio from the #1 spot for best buffet in Vegas, imho.

Food was ok... some things were very salty, some were good. Everything is very Americanized so don't expect any high quality sushi or something - you're at the wrong place. The line can be very long (we waited about an hour for lunch-ish time on Sunday).

I think the best thing about Studio B buffet is the unlimited crab lets (they have a huge stock, so they won't run out so quick), and the Mimosas. What better way to end a Vegas trip with some crab legs and alcohol. The mimosa's weren't as good as hoped, but didn't quite expect great quality drinks as well (it's a buffet after all).

Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and crème brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  
However, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  
I thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.

My friends seem to like this buffet, like a lot, while I am a little more discerning. 

The M Hotel way to the south of the Strip is in Henderson, you know that city when you come down the hill into Vegas. While most things in this area are still in the shadow of the opulence of the Strip, this is a shiny beacon stating there is more to Vegas than the Strip and even Old Vegas.

The Buffet is way on the East end of the building. The line moves quickly with the bulk of their business being the seafood buffet on Fridays-Sunday which is significantly more than the rest of the times as it's billed as ""Seafood Buffet"". Quite frankly they don't have that much seafood and it's marginally different from what I can get back home at Choices Buffet in Pala Casino. It's worse in some ways. 

First off the service was excellent from the cashier to our waiter who was cranking on our drinks and clearing, but ghosted us after we got coffee. Also they only give you 1 set of silverware, so be sure to keep yours or you will have to ask the waiter for more, there is no silverware area at the buffet, weird huh?

Salad's were on point from the red cabbage (sweet, light), to the poke(plenty of non wakame seaweed, sweet onions and toasted sesame seed oil). I was impressed with the Asian food, something from every cuisine, they even had pho and the broth was good (a little heavy on the star anise). The prime rib\/rib roast was dry as was the turkey, kielbasa was ok. The sushi was super basic and bland. The oysters were bland, though I was impressed by the mignonette. Their butter game is weak using plastic cups and the crab legs are pre-split down the middle which for most people is a great convenience, but for an experienced and highly efficient crabber I get more without the help. They also break the individual clusters which is way messier (they didn't used to). 1 side has the butter the other does not. Shrimp cocktail sauce is bland. Desserts were ok (pistachio\/lemon gelato combo son). They have a barista doing some basics. Omelets station could be more delicate as I saw 2 sloppy one's get sent out. 

Beer and wine are included, but most people don't drink while they eat and the selection is bunk. Tucked away in the corner. No bathrooms inside the buffet area and even the one's nearest are packed as it's in the heaviest traffic area. Go to the one's by the sports book, they get the least traffic. You do have room to move around and the room is nice and open, no smells permeate. As a foodie who has eaten more buffets than most I consider this good, but would never eat here as a destination, probably why we always come here on our way out of town, just because.",10,5,6

So it was with great dismay that the place would not have been worth the wait, time and $40\/pp seafood price tag. I am from small city and I can find better seafood buffet offerings for half the price. I don't know who would even give this place 2 stars. 

First the line is horrendous. I have never seen a place that has a waiting lounge after getting to the front of the line. The dining hall was half empty. I think they do this on purpose to create buzz on the casino floor. It makes it look more in demand than it really is. 

Second the seafood was at the bottom of any seafood buffet I have ever had (I have had more than most) so I know my food. For $40 a pop you should have more than two stations with crab considering the size of the place. MOST importantly I have never seen a place halve single SNOW crab legs. I have seen it for king crab but snow crabs. They did not have king crab. You have got to be kidding me. I am used to clusters of half a whole crab not individual legs. It was dry and bland looking. I say this because I did not even bother to take any. The shrimp cocktail was small and not jumbo like other places (did not bother with those either). Are you getting the picture. 

Crawfish was bland, no clams of any sort. I think that was about all the seafood I saw. 

Oh and the kicker was someone had wildly defecated on the tile floors around 2\/3 of the food line. There was a whole trail of stool and all the guests were talking about it. Unfortunately none of the wait staff seem too eager to jump in and take care of the problem. Instead they placed dinner napkins over the trail of splatters and then also placed dining chairs over it so no one would walk over it. I kid you not there were 15 chairs strategically place around the whole buffet line.

The carved prime rib was what probably saved the evening but never again on an ordinary weekday night.

Other than that, there were a ton of great selections-- from crab legs (not king crab legs), oysters, CRAWFISH, to basic tuna\/salmon sushi, etc. My favorite were the KBBQ ribs and fresh oysters. Oh, and the dessert selection wasn't too bad-- CREME BRULEE! GELATO! ... And the rest were mediocre, just because they were a tad cold.

My husband and I had been looking forward to visiting this buffet for a really long time. We arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday and didn't get to a table until around 6:30 pm. Our backs and feet were aching and of course we were starving. 

We finally got to a nice table in the back over-flow area. It was nice, clean, and had a great view of the strip. I was, however, disappointed in the seafood selections. The Snow Crab was great (even though each leg was sliced in half....no full crab legs), the Crawfish was OK, but I am a lover of Lobster and Scallops and neither were on the buffet line. 

Some of the other items on the buffet line: under-seasoned fried chicken, room-temp sushi rolls, pork loins, salads, pizza, Chinese & Thai selections, oyster, shrimp, etc...

The Osso Buco was large, but the bone was about 90% so there wasn't much meat on the bone.  The mac and cheese lacked flavor.  The Chinese food ok, but overcooked.
The buffet does have a large selection of items, but the quality of each item is not as delicious as when they first opened.  The food items were disappointing in  taste and quality of ingriedients.
 The price was $39 for the weekend brunch, which is fine as long as the quality equates to or surpasses the price.This visit it did not, and I left unsatisfied.
I'll be checking out other high quality buffets on the strip, and won't return to the M until I hear that they've brought their quality standards back to when they originally opened. THAT was impressive!!!",0,0,0

You also get unlimited beer, wine and they have all kinds of coffee and desserts. My fav was the Generals chicken and the fried prawns. Yum, Yum! The best buffet in Vegas.

We recently went for my birthday and the wait staff was rude, we were seated at 8pm (last seating of the night) before the waiter greeted us and asked us what we would like for drinks, he rudely said 'all food is broken down at 9:15' they sat us at a small dirty table and said we couldn't sit at a larger table because the back station was already closed. NOTHING was refilled at all from 8pm til closing, several empty trays and waiters too busy to get us drinks. And they actually start breaking down the buffet at 8:45 PM 

We commented to management at the buffet and his response was, I just came over to tell you, you must leave by 9:30 pm

Please tell me why we paid the same price as people coming early and  didn't have same food choices. Waiters need an attitude adjustment except the waiter who sounds like a game show host, he is always friendly and smiling. Haven't been back to this buffet since, will keep my local business at Wynn and Bellagio, pay the extra money because it is worth it.

Very disappointing this is happening at a 'local' casino",0,0,0

The boyfriend and I love going to this buffet! I love the crablegs and the cocktail shrimps. Those are pretty much the only things I eat there! The boyfriend eats the rest of the variety lol.

There are a lot of different varieties of food here! From the seafood, to the asian food, to the prime ribs, to the pizza! Everything I tried here is pretty good!

The dessert bar is deee-lish-ousss! I loved the madeleines, the flan, the crepes, everything! Unfortunately, I didnt have room for gelatto, but I will try that next time. 

I love how beer and wine is included in the price! Ordered a cider and it was very tasty! I asked whats the closest thing to moscato and this is what the lady recommended. Pretty good chouce if you ask me!

The line can get really long, but luckily for me, I've never really had to wait the 1-2 hours some people have talked about. I would estimate that my wait time this weekend was about 20-30 minutes around 2pm.

Will definitely be going back to this buffet again next time I'm in town. This is usually always our last stop as its on the way home.",0,0,0

If I could give this place 10 stars I would.

Fabulous atmosphere where you don't even feel like you're eating at a cafeteria like most of the other buffets in town.

The price won't break the bank.  I know you've heard the phrase ""more bang for your buck"".  This here gives you a BIG BANG alright.  $25 for FRESH food (they have fresh salmon sitting on wooden planks for crying out loud).    Presentation is EVERYTHING. 

Delectable desserts. When do you go to a buffet where you actually like ALL the desserts?  I can't emphasize enough how FRESH their food is.

The seating room has a great view of the Strip.  So much better than looking at 1970's fugly wallpaper and atrocious paintings like other mediocre buffets in town.

And the best part.....unlimited, yes, UNLIMITED beer and wine.  For how much again??  $25.95.  Take a couple of bucks off if you're an iMagine rewards member, of course ;)

Fast forward to this past weekend, it was our mission to eat here so we arrived at 4:40pm and the line was at full capacity, gee whiz!  Overall, our wait time from getting in line to getting seated  was a good 1.5 hours.

First off, the setup of the buffet is odd.  Yes, it's literally the shape of a ""B"" without the vertical line so, it was quite curvaceous.  Also, the main thoroughfare into the resto merged with the buffet line so there were a lot of people bumping into each other.  I will say however I was impressed.  With as long as the buffet was, there were not any duplicated offerings!

As far as food quality and selections, for a Vegas casino (Yes, I know it's technically in Henderson) it was decent.  They featured your standard buffet offerings such as Asian, Seafood, American, Italian, etc.  However, they had a few items that were unique, such as the Thai Beef Salad, Panang Beef which was spicy but delicious, Kalbi Short Ribs and Seafood Salad among a few other things.  I like how they also offered cold Crab and steamed Crab.  I didn't try the steamed Crab because the cold Crab I had was just too salty and wasn't craving anymore.  Also, I'm always hesitant about buffet Prime Rib but their Prime Rib was actually really good, just a few steps shy of steakhouse quality, in my opinion.

My favorite station overall was the Dessert station.  Granted the line for dessert was redonkulous, it was cool because it insured no one would just cut in and out.  They had your standard fare of desserts along with crepes and gelato.  I loved that they had a made to order Espresso station at the end.

Our server however was less than satisfactory.  I couldn't figure it out.  I observed the other servers in our area and they were stellar, bussing plates that were a foot high on a tray they'd carry above their shoulders, keep beves full and we get stuck with the ho hum server that would barely take our few dirty plates, much less, give us refills.  I wanted to leave him a dollar but the s\/o felt bad.  Really?  The server was bad is more like it.

Overall, would I come here again?  The food was okay but it wasn't worth that horrendous wait.  As for the 5-star reviews well keep in mind, beer and wine are included in the buffet so, 'nuff said.  ""Best buffet in Vegas..."" y'all are trippin!!!  : \/",1,2,1

For some reason the coffee is excellent here - kept drinking cups of this while eating. I wasn't a fan of the Asian food offerings but liked the paella and some of the fish they had. The best part of the lunchtime buffet was the dessert offerings - they had creme brulee and tons of gelato, cheese cakes, and lovely little shot glass cups of creme, raspberries, and other delicious desserts.

The high ceilings, open layout, and big video screens give the place a bright, modern feel. Much slicker than most any other buffet - many of which feel like they're in a cave.

The place is always very clean, and the staff is continuously asking if they can get you anything or if you would like a refill. I usually opt for my Coke or juice, but this time I had the berry hard cider. They have a small selection of beers and wine for you to choose from at the front of the buffet at no additional charge.

The food options range from the Chinese food selection to the typical sushi bar, which this one even offers salmon and tuna sashimi for those who don't want the added rice. They have the prime rib carving station, crab legs and an Italian section. If you're not feeling you want to start heavy, the salad and soup selection is really good as well. I tried the basil tomato soup with the raisin wheat bread for the first time, and it hit the spot.

My first main course plate was the prime rib, turkey and ham from the carving station. I got the mashed potatoes with gravy on the side to complement my entree. Crab legs for the second plate with butter. Oh, and they have either the steamed hot crab legs or cold. Either way you can't go wrong at all. My last plate was some antipasto salad, meatballs and a slice of pizza. Bravo to the chef for making the pizza really cheesy, just the way I like it.

I ended this meal with some great desserts. There was cheesecake, mini individual pasties, cookies and gelato. The cheesecake bite and strawberry mascarpone felt like I was in dessert heaven. To end my selection of desserts, I got 2 of the creme brûlée. Soooo good!!!

If you're visiting here for the first time, I suggest you try even just a small piece of everything they have to offer. If you don't like any, just put it aside and have your waiter take your plate when finished. The food is awesome! I had a free buffet entry from an offer they sent me. If not, it would be around $40 a head for lunch\/dinner time. This is one experience that is a must for me and my family when visiting this area. I'll be back over and over again.",3,0,1

Came here on our last night in Vegas cause my friend said it was the best buffet off the strip. For normal dinner, it cost about $40 and they close the line at 8 but the inside closes at 9. The wait wasn't too bad considering it was a Sunday evening, it was about a 15 minute wait before we got a table. Not too shabby compared to the carnival buffet I had at the Rio the night before. 

Walking in, this place really feels like you're in an international buffet. The place is lighted everywhere and so big, I felt like I was in a mansion. They have a wide variety of food which I liked. I got mussels, crab legs that are cracked for you (!!!)  and I ate like 2 plates of that so yum. My friends really liked the prime ribs which was nice, but I'm more of a seafood person. For me, I think the crab legs in heat had more meat so I suggest that. As well, this place has a FREE mini bar where, since I just turned 21, I totally took advantage of and got a bunch of champagne and then switching over to pink wine. 

The staff was super friendly. After I finished eating the ocean (LOL), I walked over to the dessert bar where I got a chocolate mousse and then gelato! I mean, it's not the best gelato but it helped clean my palette and it was decent enough. The chocolate mousse was actually pretty good, but I was too full from the seafood to really enjoy dessert. 

I liked this place better than the carnival Rio buffet because they didn't really discriminate between those who want seafood and the regular. As well, who can say no to an open bar?! NOT ME!!

On their website, Studio B claims that you can ""enjoy over 200 dishes daily"", which is absolutely true. However, please note that half of these dishes are simply variations of different salads (Caesar Salad, Greek Salad, Sweet Potato Salad, Chinese Shrimp Salad, Sautéed Kale & Strawberries etc.), which may be disappointing if you're expecting the majority of dishes to consist of meat.  

Studio B does offer unlimited beer and wine, which is unique. During my visit, they had a berry wine cooler, Stone Pale Ale, Rolling Rock and others on tap.

Not what it used to be. Food made me really sick but the desserts are still fantastic. Free buffet if you earn enough daily gaming points. 

Full review:
This used to be the best buffet in town! I am not sure what happened. About 20 mins after eating here I started to feel naseaus. I barely made it home before my entire meal came back up and I felt sick for nearly two days. Not sure exactly what was bad- could have been a number of things- The Caesar dressing was oily and chunky.  I actually spit out the bite of cucumber salad because it tasted rancid. Creamed corn was like glue with chunks of corn in it. Reminded me of the ""yellow"" at at the buffet in the National Lampoon's Vegas movie. I was afraid to try any of the seafood. 

On a better note- the meatballs were pretty good, the tomato bisque had really a fresh flavor and the Asian chicken salad wasn't as tasty as it used to be but was edible.  

The desserts here are still delicious. Excellent quality, home made, and everything you would expect from a high end pastry shop. The meringues perfectly light and airy and the Gelato was creamy. Mini cheesecake was sinful. 
 
Beer, wine, and after dinner coffe drinks are available. I did not have any this trip but in the past have enjoyed wine with dinner and an irish cream and coffee with dessert.

It is unfortunate that the food is no where near the quality it used to be.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  

If I had not gotten so ill I would have given this a little higher star rating just for the desserts and drinks. You may want to skip the food and just do desserts. Or skip it all together and go to the Bellagio instead.",0,0,0

They serve a few beers, wines and my favorite is their M Resort cider. It's so light and crisp and refreshing!! It goes great with the meal.

It was our last day in Vegas and all 11 of us hung over were pretty gosh darn hungry. The price I paid with gratuity totaled $37!! ouch right? But the food made up for it. I LOVED the oysters! No limit on how many you can take. Thank goodness!! The soup was amazing and the gelato ice cream all you can eat!! Yum!

I noticed that most buffets in Vegas have more than one dish that I take one bite of and push the plate to the side. Some may have soups and veggies that taste like it's straight out of a can, crab legs are so thin, the chicken may be too dry, fish is overcooked, or the food just doesn't taste fresh. I can guarantee that you will not feel that way eating here. 

I love seafood and that's the first stop I made. The crab legs are HUGE in comparison to the embarrassing crab legs most buffets in Vegas have to offer. They also offer fresh oysters, steamed clams, mussels, and cocktail shrimp. 

I was impressed with every single dish I chose. I did not notice a dish being TOO greasy. It was just right. 

If this buffet was located on the strip, it would put everybody out of business. I will definitely come here again!!!!!

Came here past Sunday night around 7PM.  Tried out some of my favorite items like prime rib and it was dry on one side and raw on the other end. Some of the other items like the bamboo mahi were just dry and bland also. I don't know if I came on an off day but I can't say it was worth $30 for the seafood dinner. 

If you do want to get your money's worth, get the warm crab legs. They were juicy.  Also was the oysters, the curry, the red wine (which tasted like a milder version of a cab), the beer (which was a German lager), and the desserts.

Speaking of desserts, we came here with a bunch of friends and one of the girls had a metal string inside of the desserts. When asked for a supervisor, it took 30 minutes to find the guy. He seemed apologetic and went to the kitchen staff and checked on the problem and was going to refund my friend for the meal. 20 minutes after that, he came back with a biz card and on the back it scribbled ""one free meal"". What the heck? Who is going to go eat a buffet by themselves? And didn't you promise money back in the first place?

As for the ""biggest winner"" contest, they give you these yellow entry cards which no one explained to us about. I went to ask one of the hostess and she told me that check their website to see if you are the winner for the week. Well, here is their website and it says nothing about it. http:\/\/www.themresort.com\/dining\/studiob.html

[need I say more for a buffet? :]

How about seafood buffet on Sundays for $33.99? They have an extensive selection of food from every culture. Loved that they had crab legs prepared cold, hot, or cooked with a ginger sauce. The sushi rice was kind of gross, but the fish was fine. 

The dessert bar selection was amazing too! The creme brulee was better than most restaurants I've ordered it from, light and creamy custard... Mmmm... they have gelato and sorbet, wish I wasn't so full so that I could have tried more! You can also get hot coffee beverages like cappuccino in the dessert section. Also heard that you can add some liquor to it like  Bailey's, Sambucca, Amaretto or Kahlua for no additional cost.

I usually don't like buffets because the quality of the food isn't as great [that and I don't eat much], but Studio B Buffet is an exception! Can't wait to come back and try their lunch, which is about $16! 

Pro Tips: 
-go early because this place can get busy! I was lucky enough to go during an off hour (3pm) so there was no line.

I dont know why this buffet has such a high rating. For what?!

My friends mom visited here once with her friends and told my friend that it was pretty good so after hearing that from a friend, I thought I should try. Its on the way back home anyway. I could have waited 243 minutes at Bacchanal but we just couldnt wait that long. And guess what? We waited about 1 hour and 30 mins for this place and the time we sat down was 4:30 which was 15 mins prior to my Bacchanal reservation time. Ugh.

Anyway, hardly anything is good here. Ive tried almost everything and I didnt really like anything except crab legs. I mean crab legs are crab legs. It cant be bad. Their steak was way too hard to chew on and too dry to eat. One stuffed steak dish was too nasty that I almost threw up. Their oysters were DRY and had hardly any meat on the shell. I ate one and I didnt want to risk eating more. 

The worst of worst was their sushi. YUCK! their sushi rice was hard and dry and I am almost certain that they are using one of those factory prepared sushi rice that comes out of a machine already all structured and shaped to make sushi that all you have to do is to put fish meat on top of it. I know because I saw this rice from Todai once. Gross!

Almost everything was way too salty and couldnt really enjoy any of them. Their so called 'seafood' dinner which goes from $39.99 per person is totally not worth your wait and money. All they had was crab legs, dried small oysters and cocktail shrimp.

Dont waste your hard-earned money at this buffet! Go to Bacchanal 3-4 hours early, make a reservation and hang out at the strip or rest at the hotel and come back to pay a little more and dine there. Trust me.

We purposely don't eat much before driving to Vegas from SoCal just so we can make this our first stop.  Food is always fairly good and a nice selection.  

Only thing that is frustrating is their line to get in and how it operates.  It just seems out of whack somehow and confusing for the customer as to what's going on.  A lot of hurry up to the next waiting area and then waiting without any clear instruction.

The food was good.  The selection was even better.  It's nice to see tabbouleh and galbi on the same selection menu.  Even the kim-chee was on point.  The pesto pizza was surprisingly good, and I'm so picky about pizza, but something about the look of it made me want to try it.  The oxtail soup was also on point.  I'm 100% sure I've never seen oxtail soup offered at a buffet.  

The desserts were also good.  Pecan tarts, cheese cake, creme brulee and a little cup of gelato for cleansing the palette.

The prime rib was juicy and seasoned very well.  A little fresh horseradish and au jus did the trick.  The killer part with this whole deal was that I went for Sunday brunch.  I may have to go back during dinner hours to see if this place is legit or just a mirage.

I stand corrected...",2,2,2

Pros:
- HOT and COLD crab legs with no lines :)  The crab meat quality was pretty much what you expect from a buffet.
- delicious med\/ rare prime rib, best I've tasted at a buffet.  sooo tender!
- beer and wine are included with your dinner meal price
- gelato, about 8-10 different flavors!
- coffee (it's from a ""pod"", but it was good nonetheless) 

Cons:
- desserts, pretty much everything was a miss except the gelato
- 10 miles away from the strip

On this night the only seafood available was fish, mussels, crayfish, california and veggie rolls; no crab legs.  The entrees I enjoyed were the prime rib, BBQ beef short rib, oxtail, and chicken parmesan.

Desserts were blah.  I did enjoy the apple pie and cronut.  The feature that separates this buffet from the rest is the unlimited beer, wine, coffee, and espresso.

It was juicy and flavorful, and I had to go back for seconds! They also have a really wide selection of foods, including Mediterranean, Thai, and Chinese. 

Their dessert selection wasn't the greatest, but they had some pretty good staples like creme brulee, flan, and panna cotta. They also have yummy gelato! They offer a lot of meringues, which I'm not too big of a fan of... although they are pretty. If only they could change it all to macarons - I'd be such a happy camper! 

The food is pretty consistent. I came here twice in two weeks with different people, and everything tasted the same! Meaning the prime rib was juicy and tender, and the ribs and the calamari were tough and overcooked both times. 

Also, the 2nd time I was here was the week between Christmas and New Years, and we waited about 2 hours to get in for dinner!

The salty skin on fried chicken made me feel so dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Otherwise, the chicken wasn't too bad. The prime rib was enjoyable - tender, easy to chew.

Chinese chicken salad was good - friend had 2 sizeable servings. Chicken teriyaki had too much sauce. The tuna roll was decent - basic buffet-style generically made.

Dessert bar looked good too. Had the cookies & cream ice cream.

There's also free wine, beer, lattes and espresso (please remember to tip!) and they have a gelato and sorbetto station which is awesome!  For the ice cream or cappuccinos, please remember to stand on the dessert line, it's rude to cut.  

My favorites from this place are their baked ziti, clam dish, prime rib with sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes and string beans, spicy tuna rolls, oxtail dish, shrimp cocktails, the warm snow crabs (they also have the chilled ones and I feel like they are super salty), cream brulee, flan, chocolate chip cookies (they bake it fresh!) and the gelato.  It's nice to be able to get a fresh cup of cappuccino to go with my dessert too, so that's a huge plus!

If you sign up for their players card and gamble a little, they send you flyers for buy one get one free for the buffet which we always take advantage of.

There were only 4 different sushi roll options, and nothing special. Your regular California roll and then a few different crab rolls. I'm more into specialty rolls so was kinda sad to not see any. Hubby got down on some oysters and muscles. They also had sashimi salad and poke, crab legs, some delicious baked salmon over rice, as well as a lot of non seafood options. They advertise unlimited beer but just a heads up, not many options there either. I went with the M Resort house lager and it was just okay. So okay that I only had one glass. But still!

Hmm how about...

B for bountiful! Studio B buffet has so much selection! They have all kinds of food- like Italian (pizzas, pastas), Chinese (orange chicken, fried rice, chow mein), Thai (yellow curry, red curry), American (turkey, prime rib, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes), Mexican (Spanish rice, enchiladas), breakfast entrees (eggs, bacons, corn beef hash, potatoes), all kinds of salads and a abundant amount of different desserts  (creme brulee, meringues, cheesecakes, gelato)

B for beautiful! Studio B buffet's presentation of food is simply beautiful. The desserts are a perfect example of this. They have colorful meringue cookies (pink, yellow, green), cute dessert shooters, cheesecakes drizzled in sweet strawberry syrup, small awesome looking fruit tarts and scrumptious multicolored gelato!

B for brilliant! Studio B buffet has a brilliant setup! The overall buffet atmosphere is a true winner! I like how they showcase different clips from the food network all around on large screens all around the buffet. In between the clips, are cute cartoons of dancing fruit! When we were there, at the dessert bar, there was a Super Mario cake that was a winner at a dessert contest. It was one cool looking cake. Visually pleasant and hip all around, one can enjoy scrumptious food in one of the coolest looking buffets in Vegas.

Lastly, B for best! Yummy tasting food, good selection and nice presentation of food and cool place = Studio B buffet :).

What B is it for you? ;)",7,5,4

This place is a little out of the way but I kinda appreciated the peacefulness of it while still having that modern NYC feeling at the same time (minus the crowds of people of coarse. 

This place definitely had a lot variety ranging from Asian( Thai, Korean Chinese, & Japanese) Italian, BBQ, seafood dishes, etc. It honestly depends on the type of cuisine you like because some genres were done a lot better than the others. For example the rice on the Nigiri Sushi was hard! But my Asian mother would have told me just to say the fish n leave the rice on the plate since its more of a filler. So I advice you to eat the Nigiri as if it were sashimi lol. I think I was expecting the sushi to be above other buffets that serve sushi such as Todai unfortunately it kinda fell below....

My favorite entree was the ginger crab! It was sooo juicy, moist, & flavorful to the point where my mouth is watering just writing about it. My only concern was this beautiful buffet didn't have the shell crackers for me to crack open a crab leg....this was a first...so I had to manhandle my crab by cracking it open with my bare hands (remember these crabs are slathered in a ginger sauce so u can only imagine how lovely and greasy my hands were looking...barbarian status).  So please bring in your own...had I had some I would have eaten 2x the amount! 

The all you can drink wine was an added bonus :-).

Please be sure to sit around or save room for the gelato bar...that shit gets pricey on the strip so I definitely made sure to get my fair share.

The quality of the food was great. They had everything from pasta to sushi, crab and seafood. lots and lots of variety. The only thing i didn't like was the plastic utensil they gave us to eat the crab with.

Highs:
- Prime rib. This was easily the best buffet prime rib I've ever had, so much so I indulged in a second piece. Extremely tender and very flavorful. Au jus was good too.
- Warsteiner on tap. Can't go wrong there. 
- Grilled asparagus was definite highlight amongst a collection generally sad looking vegetables. 
- Cappuccino was very good.
- If you leave without trying the creme brule you have missed out on the best thing there. 

Lows: 
- Seafood. All of the seafood was sub-par. The crab legs were so skinny they looked like they were harvested from a snow crab labor camp. Oysters were horrible and probably poisonous. Shrimp were rubbery and about the size of plankton. The mussels smelled so bad that my survival instinct kept me from trying them. 
- Sushi. Jesus, where to begin. Let's just say I think I found out where all the expired sushi at Albertsons ends up.
- Lobster bisque. I know what lobster bisque tastes like. This isn't it. Somehow I imagine giant, white, one gallon cans of ACME Lobster Bisque stacked in back.

All-in-all we managed to have a good meal and, more importantly, a good time. Trying to guess the cholesterol levels of the, shall we say, more calorically challenged patrons kept us entertained.

not being a sweet tooth myself, i skipped all that dessert stuff. but i'm with my friend that HAD tried their desserts, and when asked if it was bombskies, her eyes went wide and nodded. i'm thinking, goot thing!

I like the look of the place - circular design with a very large two-sided buffet line almost the entire diameter of the space with a portion of the radius too ( can you picture this geometry geeks ?!?! ) There's a portion of the dining area providing a nice few of the strip\/vegas valley. A rather large tv\/video screen area on the surrounding radius wall that advertises the resort, provides the dinner buffet menu and food facts - ,kinda neat. 

The food - not a huge selection, but decent ( cost - i believe $7.50 ) 
The highlights - carved to order smoked bacon - very good ! 
in the pastry section they had fruit fritters - crunchy outside, moist inside - had a rich taste to it - EXCELLENT ! 

The mexican foods - nice spice, good flavor ( enchiladas and the smoke sausage ) 

Service - very good but the place was slow. 

lowlights - no id cards for the food items ( but there's a large # of employees to ask what's what )

I paired my crab legs with more of an Asian theme with beef chow fun, kim chee, some type of crunchy noodle salad, spicy tuna sushi, salmon sushi and lots of hot sauce. With my prime rib, I paired it with more of an American\/Italian theme; meaty rigatoni, mac and cheese, green beans, and mashed potatoes. I don't believe in the no carb rule when eating buffets. Carbs are very good for you! If I could I would have eaten more. The food was delicious, fresh and surpassed my expectations. All paired with a crisp, white wine. I wasn't able to bring myself to the dessert bar since I was so full, but I munched on other people's dessert; tiramisu, crepes, and ice cream.

If you want a great dining experience and a break for the normal Las Vegas strip (since the M Resort is a good ways away), go here now!",0,0,0

(((1))) FOOD: 3\/5 stars
$24 per person for the weekday (no seafood) dinner buffet - certainly a better price than the buffets on the strip. The food here was average. I was only able to find a handful of solid items that I could enjoy. Would I come back? Slight chance, but ONLY for the the sashimi salad and the few items I have listed below:

- Salmon sashimi salad - This was the star of the entire dinner. The salmon was extremely buttery, sweet, moist, and fresh. I could just eat this all night and be happy. 
- American beef BBQ ribs - The ribs were meaty, not too dry, and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. It satisfied my rib craving just fine.
- Chinese style BBQ pork ribs - The Chinese BBQ sauce was sweet and not too salty. The ribs were moist, meaty, and didn't have too much fat, which made it enjoyable. 
- Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) - I enjoyed the flavorful and bold Korean sweet and salty marinade. Some of the meat was tender, but there were also many pieces that were charred to a crispy black.
- The creme brûlée was perfectly custardy. 
- The luscious flan had a beautiful smooth texture and not overly sweet.
- I also enjoyed being able to order Americano and expresso from the dessert bar. They were both light (watery) and not robust, but they were packed with enough caffeine to fight off the food coma.  

The rest of the food and desserts offered at the buffet were either dried out, overcooked, bland, mushy, or tasted like dishwater. I was also really looking forward to the oysters and crab legs that I've seen in pictures, but alas I didn't see them being offered last night - Note: the seafood buffet is more expensive ($40) and it's only offered Fri-Sat-Sun. 

(((2))) SERVICE: 0\/5 stars
The servers here are shockingly rude and ruined my experience at this buffet and my appetite. 

When we arrived, the ladies working the front registers advised us that their buffet line will be closing at 9 pm tonight and that's also when the food will stop being refreshed. It was about 7:50 pm, so that wasn't a problem to us - from our understanding, we wouldn't be able to grab anymore food after 9, but we would still be able to finish our meal even after the buffet line was closed. Well, that's typically the case at most buffets...

Apparently that's not the case here. What ended up happening was, we grabbed our food, ate, and when 9 pm rolled up, our server abruptly came up to us and said, ""you have to leave now, we're closed."" Her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional. Mind you, we still had a plate full of food in front of us and we were in the middle of eating (chewing) when she rudely addressed us. I had an obvious look of confusion written all over my face and she then quickly said, ""I'll give you up to 5 minutes, then you must leave"" --- Wow, who talks like that? I was in utter shock that our server was so extremely abrasive. We were just trying to enjoy the rest of our dinner and didn't know that they wanted us out of the restaurant by 9 pm - no one told us that! How does ""buffet line closes at 9"" = ""you must get out by 9""?!

We quickly tried to finish chewing so we can get the heck out of there and then another gentleman rushed up to us and yelled at us, ""just to let you know, you have less than 2 minutes to leave."" ---seriously? You can't even approach us with kindness and professionalism? I was beyond infuriated at that point and also still so confused as to how the staff here carried themselves with such poor etiquette. 

With hindsight, I understand that it was major negligent miscommunication between the staff and my party, but even so, that's never an appropriate reason to mistreat your guests or speak to them like they are livestock. 

Also, to rub a pound of salt into our wounds - I didn't even know we could have unlimited beer\/wine during our buffet - none of the servers or staff informed us. I just ordered a coke and our waitress never even came back to refill it! My glass was empty 15 minutes into eating there and I had to get up and go look for her and ask her if I may get a refill. Of course she forgot to refill it, so I had to get another server to refill it for me. Finally, my server waltzes up with my refilled coke. It was an extremely annoying dinner to say the least.",23,10,9

I went here on Saturday for lunch with my family that was visiting me from California. I paid about $180 for their seafood lunch for 4 people. If you are going with a group be ready to shell out quite a bit of money..but when is that ever new in Vegas? I was not upset with the price because I knew the buffet would be worth it.

Upon entering you will see a vast array of food spread out before you. A word of buffet  wisdom: scan around and then take a little bit of what looks appealing, and figure out your favorites. Believe me. You will want to keep eating everything there.  Everything that they have available from the crab legs to the fruit is fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite things that I tried was the prime rib. The prime rib is usually generously served and very juicy. Definitely something you want to try if you're a meat lover. Another great option that they have there is their kalbi ribs. The kalbi ribs are cooked perfectly and are very huge. I don't think I have ever seen kalbi ribs so big! 

If you aren't a fan of beef, they have various pasta choices that you can try that are very delicious. If they have mushroom ravioli available, I definitely recommend you try it. The cream sauce and ravioli filling will make you go ""Mmmmm"" from the first bite! Their crab legs are always being refilled because everyone loves them so much! They are all pretty big and have a good amount of crab meat in them. In addition, they have various fruits to choose from that look and taste juicy and sweet. 

Studio B Buffet is definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas that is actually worth the price. If you are looking for a great buffet away from the strip, this is your place! I promise, it won't disappoint you.

Our friend has suggested the buffet because of the variety and dessert station. I must say that buffet plus all you can drink wine\/beer is a steal!!!! The buffet is located in The M hotel which is a 15 minute drive down from the Strip. The buffet price is $24.99, and luckily our friend was able to give us 20% off AND vip. So we only paid $40 for dinner for 2, and we were able to cut in-front of what looked like a 1-2 hour wait of people. Yay for friends!!! LOL. This was our second buffet during our trip, and it was way better in comparison to the Spice Market at Planet Hollywood. Like 10 times better. And cheaper too!!

I would say the food was separated in different cultures.. American, Italian, Asian (chinese\/thai\/vietnamese), etc. I had a few selections from the asian and american areas which included pad thai, salads, stir fry, sweet potato mash, etc. Everything was seasoned well and in stock. I didn't have any room for the prime rib which I heard was super good. The dessert station was so much better than most buffet dessert stations. There was a selection of different cakes, cookies, parfaits and even had a gelato freezer!!! My sweet tooth was so happy. The only downside to our visit was that there was no crab legs because we went on a Monday night. But that's okay, everything else made up for it.

Glad the free buffet coupon puts you in the VIP line, we waited just a few minutes and got seated very quickly.  Buffet looks small, but they actually utilize their space really well, not duplicating dishes around the bend, as plenty of other Vegas buffets do, in an attempt to look larger.  Tables are well spread out as well, and the layout is very open - not too close to your neighbor, and a big ceiling with tv's & displays on the wall to really bring the brightness in and give it an over-all bigger depth\/feel.

Service was good.  Our plates were taken away promptly and our drinks refilled quickly.  Free wine\/mimosa\/champagne\/beer bar in the front, most people weren't tipping, but I'd feel bad not, so if you can, even just a little bit, I hope you do (you tip the cocktail waitresses on the floor, right?).

Now down to the food - well, a strong 3.75 stars.  Baked mussels were too dry - probably sitting out too long.  Wanted to get some crab & oysters & shrimp, but people pre-super bowl were trying to stuff their faces and I didn't want to deal with the mob.  Other foods were great.  Ribs were soft and fell off the bone.  Breakfast was still nice and warm when I got the eggs, corned beef & some hash browns.  Bacon wasn't too bad (can people actually do bacon wrong?).  Dessert is definitely a strong point here - fiance loved the cheesecake and the cupcakes at this place are no joke (full sized!).  Cappuccinos up by the gelato too (get the mint chip & the strawberry & coffee - best flavored ones).  Stay away from the vanilla gelato, tasted like blahhh, plain, meh.  Little shooters are also way better than the one's at Caesars.  And just the right size too.

Let me just start off by saying that what you get for the price is amazing. I was taken back by the fact they even had paella at a buffet, among their other options. And the beer and wine! Don't even get me started. 

If I was reviewing Studio B solely on its food, I'd give it a 5. But unfortunately the service we received...or didn't, put my rating down to 3. I typically expect our servers at buffets to regularly clear plates and regularly refill drinks. And our server almost felt non-existent. My plates began to pile up, not because I ate quickly, but because our server took way too long to clear our plates. When it came to the drinks, I found myself sucking down on the remaining ice in my cup, and even asking my friends if I could have some of their waters, because our server was rarely around our table for us to flag down.

Poor service aside, I'm sure I'd come back here if I was in the area mainly for the food. Hopefully you don't get the same server we did. Otherwise, prepare to be an aggressive flagger-downer.",1,0,0

Paellae is not saffron based and on par with fast food paellae found in cheap Spain sidewalk restaurants.

We came for a late lunch (around 2pm) and there was still a pretty long line, so be prepared to wait a bit.

Price- Their lunch price Monday through Thursdays are much cheaper than the buffets down on The Strip. Friday through Sundays are more expensive as those are their seafood days.

Service- Staff were friendly. They came by pretty quickly to clean up our used plates and also to bring us more drinks.

Food- They have a pretty good variety of food to choose from. There's asian\/mexican cuisine, sushi, salads, lots of veggies, and good ol` hearty american foods (meats, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, etc). The beef tri tip was super yummy and cooked perfectly to my liking (medium rare). They also offer to cook it more for you if you're looking for medium or well done. The ribs, however, were too dry for my taste. I also wish their sweet potato fries were less soggy. Taste was still okay though. 
Their desserts were bomb! I'm a huge coconut fan so my favorites were the coconut gelato and the mango coconut shooter. I highly recmmend trying those if you`re also a coconut lover!

Dinner offers you a wide selection of choices but I prefer breakfast. But focusing on dinner, there's seafood, salads, Oriental, American, Mexican, whatever your food desire is they have a little something for everyone.  Or adventure out of your comfort zone and try a little of everything. Most of the food appears to be prepared fresher than you'll find at other buffets. At some of the stations, the chefs and cooks are preparing edibles right behind the serving counters. And you can keep your beer or wine glass full if you like.

I like the selections for breakfast and it's a good way to start the day. I'm a scrambled eggs guy, which they have, but omelets are made to order.

The serving line is laid out in the semi circular U-shaped fashion, which makes it easier for people to get to their favorite items.

Inaccessible and infuriating.

What began as a 1hr-2hr wait turned into bouncers telling people that they were at full capacity or that the line was a 3+ hour wait. This happened THREE times in the past 5 days I was trying to grab a meal there.

Here's where it became a sh*tshow. The M resort offers a lot of complimentary deals now to gamblers now. Why you ask? To make their gamblers stay at the hotel longer, therefore raking in more revenue. Smart ass business plan they got there, they even have the weekdays covered with special deals such as ""Senior Wednesdays"" (a horror fest with all 60+ seniors filling the entire casino to the brim with walkers and wheel chairs). The M resort definitely cares more about making their gamblers stay; they hand out comped meals like candy therefore making the VIP line EXTREMELY long on top of the EXTREMELY long waiting lines thus translating to absolutely absurd waiting times.

Another point observed in my 5+ visits there (which all ended up driving back on the strip since it was packed to the brim), apparently they also offer meal passes (all day any day) to locals, so forget about going on weekends when the entire city of LV is trying to grab a good deal.

The M resort has made their star buffet too accessible to the masses. Just a warning to people who don't want to wait 3+ hours for a 20 dollar buffet. Are you seriously going to waste hours of your time just to save a few dollars on a buffet? Spend the extra 10 and go on to Bellagio and the Wynn, their lines move way faster now (waited 30 or less minutes for both of them on a WEEKEND during dinner rush).

Somehow it was between that (a $25 value) and $15 in slot play. Doesn't really add up, but whatever.

We managed to sneak in right before our free lunch buffet privileges expired, and ended up getting ""trapped"" inside when they brought out more seafood selections for another, higher priced buffet. Quite nice.

Everything I ate was great, save for the fried calamari. Don't really know what went wrong there. The desserts were TOP NOTCH and could be a full meal unto themselves. Who needs the crepe stations at the Paris buffet anyways?

And while the desserts may be a big draw, there is no draw bigger than an ALL YOU CAN DRINK beer\/wine bar! Wowwwww that is what dreams are made of. We each got a beverage when we walked in, but thought that it was one per person and couldn't go back for more. Midway through the meal, I decided to press my luck and go back for another beer, figuring that they'd have to have a pretty good memory to actually remember me. Another booze refill. Nothing said about it. Heck, after a while I started seeing people going up with multiple glasses and I knew it was on. And by the way, they DO have a good memory in the sense that they'll remember what you keep coming back to drink!

Upon walking into Studio B, it was like the buffet pearly gates open and I heard harps playing and song birds chirping. Liker seriously. I don't ever in my natural life can recall seeing a buffet as grandiose as this one!

There is like sooooooooooo much food. You name it, they had it. Ox tails (YUMMY) crab legs, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp, fried chicken, Mongolian BBQ, rack of lamb, prime rib, desserts GALORE. Amazing gelato (my goodness) Beer and wine included on the buffet. Sushi, steak, oysters, Chinese food, ribs......I mean everything!!!!! Everything was piping hot because they had just opened.

Went during the weekend so it was the seafood brunch. 

We went kinda early so there was not a long line. Anytime I go to a buffet I head straight for the proteins and try to keep away from the carbs. They have a great selection of food from all around the world. Everything looks clean and fresh, but what I find kind of weird is that they write the names of the food on the glass with like a marker. Why no engraved or printed signs? It isn't a big deal, but just kinda odd.

Prime Rib was pretty tasty, but the cocktail shrimp is puny unlike other buffets on the strip. Since it's pretty far off the strip you will need a car to get there, unless you're ballin' and want to pay for a taxi.

Dessert was pretty awesome too. A nice selection of pastries, cakes, cookies, gelato and other sweets. After walking out with a full stomach, I noticed the line to get in was crazy long.

The food here is really good. Everything is presented nicely on the buffet stations. 

I love their dessert stations. Lots of varieties to choose from. 

Our server was very helpful. She kept asking if we wanted more refill. Once were done with the plate, she cleared it right away.

The only downside to eating at this buffet is that it's very far from the strip at about 10 miles to Mandalay Bay. The only time, I will stop here to eat is on my way to Vegas from Los Angeles or if I'm planning on leaving Vegas.

The Sunday buffet at M Casino was exceptional. It's a little pricey at $39.99 but well worth it. There were so many options I can't even begin to name them all here but a few highlights in addition to unlimited beer and wine: peel & eat shrimp, steamed and cold crab legs (already sliced open so no struggling to get the meat out), oysters on the half shell, prime rib and roast turkey carving stations, several Thai selections, sides, sushi, salads, deserts, espresso; the options seemed endless. In addition to the massive and very tasty food selections; the setup of the buffet is very good as well and made for an easy time getting to things you wanted.

Crab legs for days!!!!!! Always a line to get crab legs but always stocked and full. 

Prime rib is a must at any Vegas buffet and they always have a fresh one ready to go cooked to perfection. 

Dessert section is a little skimpy in my opinion but I don't really enjoy dessert that much. (My dessert always consists of a piece of prime rib lol)

Oysters at any buffet are surprising to see for me, so I was so happy to see how much they had and how they were always stocked to the fullest on these. Quality wasn't the greatest on the oysters but I was just happy to see them in the first place.

Anyway, my favorite buffet for years has been the Bellagio Buffet.  Probably what made it the best was the awesome selection and the king crab legs that they served.  The last time I went there though, they didn't have king crab legs so then I really had no real strong desire to HAVE to go back there.  I mean, let's be honest.  A buffet is a buffet is a buffet.  Right?  WRONG!

Studio B in the M Resort has ousted the title of best buffet in Vegas, in my book.  *erasing Bellagio and writing in Studio B*  First of all, the selection.  Once you enter the dining area after the line for the ends after over an hour long wait, you'll see that it looks like a maze.  But I thought to myself, ""Ah, it's probably another one of those buffets that have duplicate dishes on either side, to make the line more efficient, right?  WRONG!

Every single plate, nook, cranny of that line has a different dish.  I think what I like best about this buffet is that there's a lot of Asian themed dishes here, reminiscent of dishes that you can find in Hawaii.  Yes, I'm Asian.  (You just looked at my profile picture again just to make sure I wasn't lying, didn't you?) And yes, I'm from Hawaii.  So when there's something on the buffet line in a resort NOT located in The California Hotel or in the Main Street Station Hotel and Casino, it's actually pretty impressive.  Kal bi?  Teriyaki steak?  Wow.  If I lived in Vegas, this would definitely be a place that I would come to so I could get  my local food fix.  They also have crab legs!  OK, so it's not king crab legs.  But it was still delicious!  

So what's the worst part of a buffet?  Having to pay for drinks when you already paid a lot for the food, right?  WRONG!  They even give you unlimited wine and beer here!  When I went, I didn't have any since I don't like to drink when I'm trying to binge eat and pretend I'm not going to eat again for a week.  But next time I go, I'm definitely going to get some alcohol to consume with my meal.

What's the second worst part of a buffet?  Poor service, right?  WRONG!  The service here was great.  Our server ensured our iced teas were always refilled and we had all the napkins or whatever else we needed at hand.  

If you come to Vegas, make sure you come here.  And try to come on a weekend so you get the FULL (seafood) buffet.  Don't walk...RUN!  It'll bump you up ahead of at least a few people in line, guaranteed!",3,1,1

I had never heard of this buffet before and didn't know what to expect. Wow! I will be recommending this place from here on out. The sea food was amazing! I have simple pleasures when it comes to sea food, I tried my first oyster (brought me right to the ocean!) and was so happy to see crab legs opened with delicious looking meat, next to a tower of the most delicious shrimp I've ever had. I dedicated a plate to those 2 foods!! 

All of the food was really good, I found some of the sushi to be a bit dry but I also forgot the sauce! It was still excellent! Anything you want at a buffet, I found it here. 

Last but definitely not least, although it looks like a small area for desserts, they put a lot of variety in a small area! The desserts were amazing and I wish I could have sampled them all, I was too full by then! But I had a lot of them just because they looked too good not to.

The staff was exceptional, and a weird thing I factor into a restaurant is their root beer. The woman helping us at our table informed me that they have root beer on tap! IS THIS HEAVEN?! 

Speaking of heaven, although I'm not a big drinker (besides the root beer!) they have beer and wine included in the price of the buffet, and although it's not a cheap buffet, I think you get more than what you pay for by eating here!

Let's face it the unlimited house wine and beer is a huge seller. Eat forever and get drunk. 

Another aspect of studio B is the wide open space they have. Creates a real comforting eating environment to gorge my face. Lastly the food speaks for itself if I give it 4 stars.

Their dessert, omg, I liked all of them! 

This place is really great! I did knock down a star because it's off the strip!  It's a bit of a drive!  You need a car to get here! Don't even think about cabbing it! =(",3,3,3

This is one of the few buffets I know of where BOTH Asian and American dishes were yummy! The desserts were amazing and cute too; my favorite was the mango parfait and the gelato. The poor servers here were working to the bone to serve us!

There was this server, Becky, a forty-somethin year old woman wearing pig-tails, who was a bit weird. We asked her if there were tools to break down the crab legs since they only gave us the weak and useless plastic crab leg scraper. Her reaction was this: ""You HAVE them, I GAVE them to you!"" in a defensive and whiny tone as if we were blaming her for not having tools. Later on she said the buffet didn't have the good quality tools because people kept taking them home. That made sense, but she didn't have to react like that at first! yeesh. For a second, I thought she was a serial killer from looking at her facial expression as she said that.",2,0,1

I was invited to have a buffet here in Studio B, and most buffets make money off of their alcohol. Studio B has beer and wine as part of the buffet. On to the selection, it is HUGE. Anyone walking in will find something they want. I tried almost every dish on the menu, and it was good. So far it's the best Vegas buffet I've been to. It's really clean, and you can see that they emphasize a lot on the quality. The prime rib was delicious and tender, they have snow crabs, and a lot of selections that are virtually unheard of in your standard Vegas buffet.

Most Vegas buffets have a reputation for quantity over quality, but as I heard from one of my acquaintances, when M opened they really wanted to provide the quality of the buffet and they didn't just want regular people coming in to take as much as they wanted but to actually TASTE the food & come out satisfied with that quality. Recently though, he said that the quality isn't as good as when it first opened, but still better than most.

I've been here twice, and the first time, our taxi driver told us this buffet is catered towards the locals because it's near a big new housing community. The locals know good food! Food selection is decent. On the weekend, there's oysters (eh, nevada oysters..), fresh shrimp cocktails, a variety of hot foods, salads, fruits, and well made desserts (my favorite, is their creme brulee..you can never go wrong! and they have a gelato bar)

On top of a pretty well priced buffet, ALCOHOL is included!!! wine, beer, cider, and mimosas galore!

Foods I enjoyed: rosemary lamb, steamed clams, spicy tuna rolls, shrimp scampi, tri-tip, kalbi, chocolate souffle, gelato, creme brulee, and carrot cake.

Selections for the Seafood night are very diverse and I wouldn't necessarily say they offered a lot of seafood, but they did have good quality choices in hot and cold snow crablegs, oysers, shrimp every which way, and a pretty good Salmon roasted on a bamboo plank.  The crablegs were meaty and firm, pretty good quality if you think about the volume they must go through for the night.

The selection is rounded out by your usually salads and veggies, bbq, asian, and Italian fare.  Overall the quality of selections were very good but in any buffet it is difficult to maintain quality on every dish, especially if your items hover around 50+.

As a bonus they do serve wine by the glass (think 2 buck chuck brand) and draft beer (Coors Light, Pabst, Primo, and Cider).

Service is good, our table of 14 never felt like we had to search for our attendant.

1.) Studio B: You are getting top quality food for a very good price. I've eaten here on every trip and I wouldn't mind paying more if I had to because I know the meals will always be delicious. Tip: if you're not a seafood fan then go on the weekdays and save $10 per person. They serve a seafood buffet on the weekends. My favorite thing here is their succulent prime rib served at dinner time on the weekdays and all day on the weekends. I've had some of the best sashimi salad, Pad Thai, Korean short ribs, and lobster ravioli here. Plus the tap beer and wine is included. They used to serve a breakfast buffet which was the best I've had anywhere, but being 8 miles away from the Strip, I can see why they weren't packing in the crowds. 

2.) Sterling Brunch: It's been about 4-5 years since I've enjoyed a Sunday brunch here. And if you're a big fan of all you can eat baked lobsters and caviar with your sushi, and endless mimosas, this place is great.  Plus you can have your personal waiter get your food for you. The selection of food is limited but the quality is top notch and all prepared by professional chefs. Tip: You usually need a reservation and the price 3-4 years ago was $90 per person. 

3.) Wicked Spoon: I've been to this place once and remembered a few dishes being pretty good while many others were just average.  However, the way the foods are displayed is very appealing to the eye. The lines and prices weren't outrageous either. 

4.) Bacchanal Buffet: I would rate the quality of food the same as Wicked Spoon with a few dishes being good while others are just alright. However, their selection is extensive  and their presentation is really great, but the fact that the line and wait time is usually 2-4 hours long, it's just not worth it. Plus it's $50 per person. 

5.) Buffet at the Bellagio:  Again, some very good dishes and a wonderful prime rib but not worth the average wait time of 2 hours and not worth the price tag of $40. But the last time I was here was about 3-4 years ago so things may have changed. 

6.) The Buffet at Wynn:  I was just here a week ago and I remembered it being much better 5 years ago.  If the short lines is an indicator, then it's just not one of the better high end buffets anymore and for good reason.  I've had much better prepared dishes at MResort's lunch than I did at Wynn's dinner.  Their fresh crepe bar is the only thing I enjoyed about my meal here.",2,0,1

We are always a little hesitant about buffets...especially since the first buffet we tried in Vegas that week was kind of disappointing. Studio B Buffet ended up being absolutely wonderful!

Studio B Buffet is in The M Resort (we recommend that, too). It isn't in the middle of the strip...it is further down Las Vegas Blvd near the I-15 entrance\/exit. Even if you have to drive or take a cab, I think it's worth it.

After eating at the first buffet we tried (their price was $35\/person) and being let down, we were more than willing to try this place for dinner for $23.99\/person. Dinner hours started at 4pm, so we got there around 3:30pm. There was already a line (other people were saying that was unusual for that time), but it really didn't take that long to get through it. We got up to the front of the line and paid - it was about 5-10 minutes before 4pm. After we paid, I realized that the price they charged was the lunch price so it was an even better deal. I don't know how it normally works, but that was fine with me! LOL!

We didn't have a chance to hit it when they had the Champagne and Lobster feast, but we were still pleased with the variety. There was a little bit of everything (I can't remember all of it) - prime rib, tri tip, Korean short ribs (my husband went nuts over those!), rotisserie chicken, pastas, various Asian dishes, shrimp cocktail, enchiladas, fruit, salads, veggies, all kinds of yummy desserts, etc.

Our waitress was great - friendly, on top of drink refills and constantly cleared our plates.

Many times you find mediocre food that's been sitting for a long time under heat lamps, small selections of different cuisines, or you end up in a buffet having paid over $20 for your meal only to find that you like one or two dishes that they serve.

Then there was Studio B.  Friends and family talking about how awesome it was, the great desserts they offer, the all you can drink beer and wine!  It turned out to be true.  One of my favorite things at this buffet is the meat carving; they offer large, juicy cuts that go great with their horseradish.  I have to stop by at least three times during each visit, I'm such a fatty!  Seafood selection seems fresh and is satisfying as well.  I'm not much of a dessert person but I always end up getting two plates here.  Be sure to try the cream puffs!

I'm not sure that I've been to another casino buffet that makes me feel like my $30 is so well spent.  The only thing to be on the lookout for is the killer line to get in.  Be sure to get to the line when you're kinda hungry, not super hungry.  Use the time waiting in line to build up the rest of your appetite, otherwise you'll be grumpy and stuck in line, two things that don't go well together.",4,2,3

You know that random buildling about 10 miles from the strip that looks like it's out of place? YUP, welcome to the M resort! Before coming here, I've heard some pretty amazing things about this place and my friends and I FINALLY got off our lazy butts and drove here. BOY WAS IT WORTH IT. 

First, UNLIMITED and PAID FOR (included in the buffet price) amount of champagne and crab and lobster?!?! Uhhh, YES PLEASE. Second, the food variety here is AMAZING. This was pricey - $50\/60 per person - but it is REALLY really worth it. Come on ... unlimited portions of these?! Score! We literally stayed here for about 2-3 hours just eating mounds of seafood and drinking glasses of champagne and mimosas over and over. NOM. 

Like I said, the other food choices are also extremely delicious. I LOVED the quinoa (my new favorite food!) and veggies. Everything was extremely fresh and the line for the seafood was actually NOT long. We were lucky to not wait in line since our friends held the table for us, but the line seemed a bit long ... though it looked like it was moving pretty fast. 

This buffet is spacious and able to hold LARGE parties - we had a party of about 10-12 and we just scooted tables together with no complaints. 

I'm pretty much in love with this place ... but WHY does it have to be so far from the strip!? :( It really is the only inconvenience ... but I guess if you're a gambler, the casino is pretty nice. So after you've stuffed yourself silly, go ahead ... gamble! We actually came up about $100 when we stopped by. Try your luck ;)",3,1,0

I love their dessert!!! They got everything and it all looks appetizing.

Don't forget to order some wine Pinot Noir ;-) and I also got some caramel latte on the side. I was probably drinking from 3-4 glasses.

Despite the long line, my boyfriend and I ALWAYS wait.  I would suggest going for Friday dinners or any time during the weekend b\/c they have the seafood buffet at these times.  At other times, it's just their regular buffet, which is ~$20 w\/ tax.  The seafood buffet is ~$40 w\/ tax for obvious reasons, but it's totally worth it.  

Whenever I catch the seafood buffet, I gorge myself w\/ steamed snow crab legs (which is served cold AND hot) and oysters.  A couple months ago, I remember them having crawfish, but when I visited in early January, I didn't see any crawfish -- must not be in season.  But the snow crab legs and  oysters alone are satisfactory.  They slice the snow crab legs in half, so you don't have to go through the trouble of breaking the legs -- which makes things a lot more enjoyable when you're gorging yourself.  

Aside from the seafood, their other buffet choices are excellent.  They have wonderfully tender steak options; the salad bar is phenomenal; and their soups are delish.  My favorites are the tomato basil, lobster bisque (only served w\/ the seafood buffet), and the  miso soup (which has a large variety of seaweed in it).  They also have FREE ALCOHOL. You can choose from a variety of wines and beers.  I'm not sure if they have mixed drinks, but they may add it in the future.  Last, but not least, the dessert bar is to die for b\/c they literally have everything under the sun, from gelato to flan to cake to tiramisu and plenty more.  Studio B is certainly amazing!!!

The only con I can see (aside from the long lines) is that Studio B Buffet is in the M, which is 10 miles off the strip.  So if you stay on the strip, you'd have to drive 10 miles.  This is what my boyfriend and I do: we drive in from So Cal to Las Vegas and drop by the M to eat.  Then when we drive back to California, we drop by the M again.  Everything's on the way in this case, so it minimizes inconvenience.  Hope this helps any of you coming from So Cal.",0,0,0

Contradicting?  Sure.  But when its all said and done you leave here drunk and satisfied from all the free alcohol and wide variety.  My review is being written by the carnivor in me because that is all i had at studio B because when i drink i just wanna pupu on meat and they had alot of meat.  The buffet itself is quite enourmous and its probably a hundred yards long slithered like a snake starting with the bar  and ending with a pizza\/meditteranian station and on the other side of the bar the dessert station.  My lady, kids and mother in law had a blast at studio B sampling everything from thier asian station, pasta station, salad station, carving station and dessert station.  Studio B is not your average buffet because of the variety they have and none of the dishes are repeated as it is at most buffets.  The reason for the five stars is the free alcohol that is included in the price which is why i decided to visit studio b before the bellagio buffet.  The last time i was in Vegas the M resort and casino was in construction so this was my first visit to studio B.  Best buffet in Vegas?? Between studio B and Bellagio i think so.
     The carving station, while standing in line i started to drool, was on the top of my hit list and i hit hard so hard i thought i had gout the next morning lol.  When i stood in line for my succulent piece of prime rib i lost intrest when i saw there was a 1\/4 piece left of the huge roast and it looked well done, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut they brought out a brand new prime rib roast and i asked for a big middle cut and it was medium rare just way i like it.  Yum!  After that it was history and every piece was medium rare seasoned to perfection and you had the choice of toppings such as horseradish cream, butter, au jus, horseradish, pico de giyo, cranberry sauce, gravy and some kind of sweet sauce.  Devine!
     I also had thier turkey breast which was so so and thier tri tip roast which was good but a little chewy for my liking.  I cant comment on the flavors of anything else but i know my family liked it very much there is a lot of everything for every taste bud and preference.  The other thing i did try was thier dessert station and it was normal buffet dessert transformed in to eligance.  The also had capaccino and probably 10-15 gellato flavors.  Its hard to screw up dessert and studio B didnt dissapoint.  I know the raves about studio B is the seafood buffet but we went on a tuesday night and i believe the seafood buffet is on the weekends.  Besides im not a seafood kind of guy but i dont remember seeing any seafood except for shrimp, which i didnt have.
     The all you can drink beer and wine is why this place became our first buffet destination and by the time i left i was pretty hammered lol.  They have draft beer only and three different wines.  I think the draft changes every so often but none the less its still all you can drink and thats a good sign of service in my book.  The best kept hidden secret, if at all a secret, is you can go in, while someone in your group holds your place in line, and start drinking!  The wait is a wait as it is at every buffet in Vegas but if you have a players card then you get priority so get the players card.
     If you are looking to start your binge eating at a buffet i highly recommend you start at studio B and i can guarentee you wont be disappointed.  The prices for dinner M-F are 22.99 for adults and half that price for kids 3 and older while younger are free.  If you like to binge drink while in Vegas then studio B is the place to be lol.

Food is to die for! I tried to sample as much as I could! They make everything in small batches so it does not get stale. Everything was so flavorful!

Meringues..ice cakes..cookies..tarts..crepes galore! Hold on let me wipe my drool before I continue. 

An added plus about this buffet is that they serve unlimited wine and beer as apart of your meal. No extra charge..ITS INCLUDED!

The carving station is bigger than most budget buffets. We first ate here for breakfast and the quality was excellent. The cold fish's station was superb. The salmon and typical breakfast additions to make a wonderful breakfast bagels were perfect as were the other cold fish dishes. The eggs Florentine and eggs Benedict were made in small batches and were perfect. All the other breakfast items were also great like a yogurt parfait's and the omelette station was fantastic. The waiters\/waitresses and sous chefs at the stations were excellent and helpful.

Lunch time more stations opened up as well as the all you can drink wine and beer station and the dessert station. The selection was out of this world and while most of the food was great to fantastic there was one or two or five items that were okay or needed some help. For example the baked salmon was overcooked sadly that you can see it as a foodie. The beef tips while deliciously soft were in a under seasoned gravy.  The beef panang while the veggies were quite delicious and crunchy in a deliciously spicy broth had beef in it that had some quite tough where one piece I had to use my napkin to get it out of my mouth for the first time in my life in a restaurant.  I could not chew it it was that bad. Other than just some slight other things like slightly overcooked chicken in the green curry but otherwise the food was great.  The bread station was excellent and whoever the Baker is who does the olive bread I would love to shake his hand.

While I did not indulge in the wine and beer, I did try The M Resort's own cider.  This nectar is so good, almost soda like, almost cider like, almost sweet summer wine like.... I felt like it was almost non alcoholic it was so good, and great with a meal. 

Dessert was heaven in a cup....  Every thing they serve was fantastic!!!!  I had the chocolate soufflé... It was a warm fluffy lightly sweet puck of godly goodness in a aluminum mini pan.  Then in a shooter cup i had the pistachio shooter... A mousse of pistachio with a berry (blueberry?)puddling on the lower half as a delightful foil topped with a shelled pistachio.  Next a passionfruit mousse shooter, perfectly sweet & light cloud atop a bittersweet chocolate pudding as a great counterpoint.  lastly the the perfect raspberry cheesecake... A lopped off pyramid of cheesecake sans crust with a purée of raspberries in the center indentation   Chef... YOU HAVE RUINED ALL OTHER ENJOYMENTS OF CHEESECAKES FROM NOW ON!!!  (I tried a plain cheesecake at a regular buffet a few days after.... Why it was good & it had a crust, it was not The Cheesecake).  I was in food orgasm. It was the perfect end to a great meal.

Note;  if you have a handicapped family member with you, they have a line for your party so you will not have to wait long in line and once paid there is a sofa to wait for your table.

I wish I could take it all back.

I'm not going to say that Studio B is a bad buffet, because that's not true for many people. (Like, say, the many people wrapped around the queue every evening.) I just hate when I read a restaurant review and someone says a place is ""bad"" or ""good"" and leaves it at that, like I'm supposed to just accept their word from on high. Restaurant reviews are useless without some idea of the commenter's expectations.

Let's get the big elephant on the center dais first: I'm a vegetarian. ""Oh,"" you meat eaters might now be saying, ""no wonder. Probably cries herself to sleep if they don't have six kinds of alfalfa. High maintenance!"" No no no no, please listen to my tale...

Like I said, I couldn't shut up about this buffet when it opened. We sometimes ate there two or three times a week. I cannot stress enough what a huge fan I was. Six kinds of soup, and at least two of them always vegetarian? Yum. Three or four pasta dishes - a ravioli, an alfredo with vegetables, a pomodoro, and a ""pink"" sauce item? Nice. Three of four kinds of legendary M Resort bread? Mmmm. Four or five types of slice cheese? Deee-lish.

Now, this is where the vegetarians are going to chime in. ""Really, Shari? You're satisfied with just some pasta, soup, cheese, and bread? Have you ever *been* to the Wynn? TI? Bellagio? Even... yikes... Sunset? What was so great about Studio B?""

Okay, so the vegetarian offerings weren't the most stylish, and the pasta wasn't made to order, and the salads tended to be meaty, and the salad bar itself was a little slim, but you know what? The food itself was just soooo fresh and of obviously high quality. Top it all off with a little coconut gelato, and it was an unusually excellent buffet. Who needs much variety or originality when the quality is amazing?

THEN THINGS CHANGED.

The cheese slices became cubes: your choice, orange or white. The vegetarian soup became one single offering for eternity: tomato bisque. The ravioli disappeared. Ham was added to the alfredo. The remaining pasta dishes became two ""pink sauces"" items - one penne, one tortellini, and both always congealed upon delivery.

The bread... well, sometimes it's the lone memory of better days, and other times it's just one kind, slow to be replaced.

Furthermore, the staff changed. Originally, we were impressed by the near-Disney cheerfulness of the employees. A year later it was all slow\/bad drink service an rushed apologies. Everyone is still extremely nice, but it's clear that staff reductions are causing strain.

And that little cup of coconut gelato? Prepare to wait... and wait... and wait some more, as the single person manning the desserts area must keep stopping to make cappuccinos.

Thanks to coupons and my husband's love of the buffet, I've kept schlepping along. Hubby only needs a strong Asian section to be satisfied so Studio B - who clearly know where the largest demographic bread is buttered, so to speak - is great for him; in fact, the Asian offerings just keep increasing.

Loving bloke that he is, and sad that our visits get further and further apart, he politely asked the M Resort if they're thinking of varying the soup or the cheese or the pasta, like in the beginning. The first time they were receptive to his comments and asked him to check back often. Eventually, though, they blew him off with a remark that the buffet was popular as-is and they had no plans to offer more veg-friendly fare unless a ""significant number"" of people requested it.

That's fine. Honestly, I don't feel like I'm entitled to special privileges or like a buffet should cater to the minority. It's unfortunate for me, but I certainly appreciate a business needing to make the best buck possible.

Except... well... how is that so many other buffets can do it? 

I sometimes dream of the potato strudel from Bellagio and the cashew rice from Wynn. Spice Market has grilled veggie kebobs and cheese enchiladas. Treasure Island is small but knocks my socks off with their made-to-order pasta. Even Sunset Station does custom pasta and quesadillas. And I can't say how many buffets can do better than always making tomato soup their veg option.

But all Studio B can do is shrug and say it isn't really in their interest to change? 

I was excited when the breakfast buffet returned for the summer... until we saw that the omelet makers now just recycle the same three pans for everyone. I've watched them reuse the same pans on every visit this summer. The rest of the meal is always fine - it's breakfast - but why return, really? It's time to forget the Studio B that was and just... sigh... let go.

You may love Studio B - many do - but vegetarians should be wary, and those who haven't been in a year or so may need to lower the bar before returning.",2,2,1

Ate here on a Friday night and the line wasn't bad, but it did take almost 20 minutes to get through the 10-15 people ahead of us. Some people say they liked the layout of this place, I didn't. All the people lining up for the crab legs block all the food right ahead of it, so you don't know whether to cut in front of them if you just want to grab something, or wait with everyone else even if you're not going for the crab legs. 

The crab legs were pretty good. The oysters were not. The prime rib was good. The sushi not so much. The gelato was good. The other desserts not so much. Beware they have macaroons, not macarons. The veggie dishes were fresh. The shrimp cocktails were small and limpy. The unlimited beer and wine is a nice addition, but really are you going to fill yourself up with alcohol at a buffet? 

This place is probably on par with Wynn and Bellagio, but at a lower price point, so that's a plus.

Free beer and wine is included. Desserts were outstanding. Staff is super nice. The property and the pool is very nice as well. The cheap buffet lures you to the property and the nice pool makes you want to stay here. Great marketing. It works.

I took a star off because my wife thinks something she ate something there that made her sick. Nobody else got sick and we ate like pigs the entire weekend so I'm not convinced. Might have been the tequila shot the night before too.

I could really just stop there and it would cover it all.  But, I think people would be happier with some details.  I went there Friday 6\/1 for dinner with my husband and teenage daughter to celebrate hubby's birthday.  I'd read a lot of great reviews of Studio B and we wanted something a little upscale - food-quality-wise.  We were not disappointed.

Initially, things did not start well.  We paid almost immediately and then had to stand in line for 15 minutes or so to be seated.  15 minutes is not that long, but we'd already paid, so it was more irritating than anything else.  But, we were seated at a lovely table near the bar, which please my husband immensely and he mostly forgot about the wait.

We made a quick stop at the bar to take advantage of the included beer\/wine.  I was really surprised to see that there were a number of options, including a raspberry cider and a draft rootbeer.  My husband had some sort of microbrew lager, and I had the cider.  It was crisp and refreshing and very tasty.  

Ok, but the food... that's the big thing... It was almost unending in quantity and variety.  There were 6-8 carving stations with Prime rib, ribs, turkey, chicken, etc in addition to hundreds of buffet offerings.  It was not laid out as well as some buffets I've been to, it seemed that most of it was thematic, but there were things mixed in everywhere.

The selling point of the buffet is the weekend seafood.  No question about it.  And they lived up to the hype.  I personally ate hot crab legs, shrimp, mussels, some fish & chips (that was soggy) and some calamari.  There was also crayfish, dozens of varieties of shellfish and fish dishes.  Additionally, we loved the gnocchi and bacon dish, the mac and cheese, the pad Thai, miso soup and the tomato and mozzarella salad (I think they make their own cheese).  We sampled a variety of desserts and we happy with everything - I loved the gelato.  

In all, this was fantastic.  When you took the drinks into account (2 each for hubby and I), the $30 price tag per person is not unreasonable by any means.  The food was hot and tasty.  We won't be going back often because of the price, but I know we'll go back.",0,0,0

You may ask yourself, ""why do all these people keep going there? It can't just be because of the food can it?"" Of course it can silly. The buffet here is one of the best ones in terms of quality compared to other buffets. The only reason why this is a solid four stars is purely for the slightly above average Asian food and selection. That is purely because I am bias and nothing compares to my mother's cooking. The rest of the food is near or at restaurant quality so you will thoroughly enjoy yourself here.

Asked around for best buffet, and was told repeatedly that it was the M.  Went there for Seafood Brunch - Fantastic!  Have gone back several times with out of town visitors.   But, something has changed.  Now, not only would I not go again (after two bad outings), I won't be taking anyone there.   

Sunday, went for the breakfast buffet- $10.  Awful.  Most pans were either empty, or in need of a refill.  I finally got a serving of Eggs Benedict (my favorite) - muffin wasn't even cooked, let alone warm.  Egg: over done.  Didn't finish it).   Line for ""cooked to order eggs"" was ridiculously out of hand - they had the line following the buffet, making easily 1\/3 of it next to impossible to access (Management, Really?  Don't you see how this is ineffective?  I would have had that line re-routed within 5 minutes, and I don't even work in F&B industry).  

Today, I played at the M so I earned a 'free' lunch buffet.  Line wasn't long, so I went on in.  After I paid, I still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  Once I was allowed entry, I was escorted to  my table, passing by many empty tables and many tables that needed to be cleared.  Food was just 'meh'.  

True that the desserts are plentiful and tasty - but the same every time I've been there.  No variety.  Not worth it.

We went at an off peak time (2-3pm) on a Saturday but there was no line!  Winning!  It was pricey at $86 for two of us after tax.  The crab legs are a popular draw, they are now split for your eating like a machine convenience.  I am starting to agree that, despite the decrease in work, the split legs are perhaps less appealing than the ones you do on your own.  Split legs tended to be colder and more difficult to get a good chunk of meat.  Still good!  

There are a myriad of dining options at this buffet.  The Kalbi Korean ribs were tasty.  The lamb chops were thin and covered in a delicious sauce.   I also enjoyed the all you can drink options.  Mimosas, white zin, beer, strawberry cider, merlot, cab. to name a few.

$26 for an intense seafood buffet complete with crab legs and raw oysters.The variety of food is amazing, featuring everything from buffet staples such as Chinese food and pizza, to less buffet-featured fare as Thai food, crepes and gelato. Beer and wine are also included, as are espressos and lattes.  Definitely the best value I've ever heard of, even for vegas. 

The waitress was really friendly and attentive, and the venue is pretty flashy (actually, the whole hotel\/resort is really slick.) We didn't eat in the main area next to the buffet, but more in the back which is a little less cafeteria-like and has peaceful view of the surrounding area. 

I suggest if you want to check it out then go before 5pm. We got there literally minutes before the rush (around 4:45, 4:50pm), so we didn't wait more than 10 minutes.  Once it hit 5, almost like magic it became a one to two-hour wait.",0,0,0

This place is unbelievable. We try to stay clear of buffets these days, but this is the best buffet, in every category, that I have ever seen. From selection, way to numerous to mention, to quality, to layout, to service and attitude, it is beyond any buffet I have ever experienced. You can eat healthy with multiple fish\/crab\/oyster\/sushi\/shrimp etc. selections, or down home with fried chicken, (very good), Bar B Q ribs, mashed potatoes\/gravy, or some of the best looking prime rib I have seen anywhere, let alone a buffet. We walked straight in without a wait that they say can be hours on a week day. Draught (draft) beer in a chilled glass, and wine are included. Don't remember the price, but it wasn't expensive!!! Go figure!!! 


This is my second review, we went back last week, 10-10-10, I won't change the rating, but if I did it would be much lower, as it would verify what I was told, and what I said in my initial posting, ""DON'T GO ON A WEEK DAY""!!!!!!!!

When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.

I have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  

Meats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  

While not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.

And then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.

Finally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.

Overall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election.",13,6,8

I came here in June but the line was so long that we gave up after waiting 45 minutes and seeing that the line was not moving fast enough.  This time around, there was no line!!  4 of us got in and seated in about 10 minutes so that was good because I've been hearing a lot about this place and really wanted to see what it was all about.  Walking in, the setup is impressive with the LCD TV's surrounding the place making the walls change patterns every so often.  The counters stretch for what seems like miles with tons of food.

Some simple rules I follow when going to a buffet are:
1) Don't waste space on low value items like bread, salad, and drinks
2) Start with many items in small quantities to determine what you want to go back and get.
3) Seek out the most expensive but best tasting food in the place and load up on it to make it worth the money you paid (here, $22.99).

So, to follow my rules, I grabbed a plate and started on one end of the counter and worked my way through looking for things to try that I would go back and refill on after trying more things.  Once I tried many things, I stuck to the different shrimp offerings they had as each one was really good but I really liked the shrimp scampi but stayed light on the sauce because the cream definitely has a lot of calories.

My friends didn't really follow any rules and loaded up on stuff they said didn't taste good so they were passing full plates for the server to take away.  But, no need to worry, the scraps are picked up by the pig farms in North Las Vegas so it is indeed recycled.  However, the one thing they really enjoyed was the all you can drink wine and beer.  I don't know what kinds of wine they had but I know beer offerings consisted of PBR on tap as well as a raspberry cider that smelled delicious.

After stuffing ourselves with the main course, we save a little room for dessert.  One of my friends recommended the cookies, especially if they just came out the oven.  So, I walked over and loaded a plate for all of us which included said cookies which were warm!!  I brought the cookies, chocolate covered Rice Krispies, and pecan pie over and we enjoyed the calorie filled desserts guilt free.  After that, we all went back to get the ice cream, maybe it was gelato, and grubbed on that which was excellent.

Overall, this was a really good buffet.  I don't go to buffets often but this one makes me want to come back next time I'm in Vegas.",0,0,0

Inside I found this to be very high on my lists of hotel buffets. A fabulous selection of entrées and even, my favorite, lobster bisque. The crab legs were on the small side but more than made up for by other select selections.

I've certainly been to bigger, larger and more expensive hotel buffets with terrible service and long lines. So there is always a balance and, in this case, in favor of Studio B.

I would go every week, trying every single buffet in town. But that was like 8 years ago. After trying all the different buffet in town, I'm really tired of it already. It's always the same thing again and again. 

I personally prefer going to Studio B for weekdays lunch, since the major difference between lunch and dinner\/weekend  is the oysters and crab legs. I don't think it's worth the extra money for that

Studio B Buffet has relieved my appetite of loving back the buffet I used to love. It's like meeting your first love again. 

Studio B Buffet has varieties of food menu like all other popular buffets in town, so what makes Studio B Buffet stands out among best of the best?

1. Unlimited red wine, white wine, and beer. That's definitely a good first impression to everybody. But it won't matter if the alcohol tastes horrible. As a huge wine and beer drinker myself, I can tell you that those are a pretty good wine and beer. 

2. Don't care too much about alcohol? Fine, get yourself a fresh made cappucino, latte or even espresso! 

3. Deserts. Most of other buffet has many varieties of desert as well. But few of them took the time to make their desert like Studio B. The desert that Studio B offer, is the same quality that I would pay from a bake shop. In fact, theirs taste better than most of local store in town. And what's best is, all of their deserts are offered in a bite size plate. So you get to try as many as deserts you can before you get too full. 10 flavors of gelato, flan, creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate souffle, coconut macaroons, crepes and so many more.

There are so many good food that I can't even remember anymore what I ate. I just remembered that their oxtail soup is sooo good. The meat are so tender. I don't know why they didn't put it next to all of the other soup.  It was placed next to the ribs I think. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

Overall, it was really a good experience. No matter what kind of cuisine you like, I'm sure you'll find yourself something you'll like. 
Well, except if you're vegetarian. I don't think it's a smart idea to go to any buffet for vegetarian, unless it's an indian restaurant.",3,2,1

I guess those same people have never been to Studio B Kitchen at the M Hotel and Casino Resort. Not only has it been voted by Vegas locals as the best buffet in town, the quality and abundance of food is exceptionally good. Definitely better then Bellagio, Rio and Wynn. Truly the best Vegas buffet experience around. Its located 20 minutes from the Vegas strip south of I15 in Henderson. Before heading home to LA, I always make Studio B my final dining destination. 

Prices are pretty reasonable - Lunch Mon-Fri $17 and Mon-Thur Dinner $24. Weekend prices are slightly higher due to seafood buffet - dinner\/brunch is $43. Unlimited beer and wine is included with seafood dinner\/brunch. That's right! ""Unlimited beer and wine"" - no gambling involved. Service is pretty good. I've been here several times the waitress always stops by to refill our drinks and quickly clears our plates. During weekends and holidays, seating usually averages about 20-30 minutes due to it's popularity. I guess word of mouth is spreading fast.

The Food - Everything is delicious and high quality. My recommended favorites include:

Carving station - Prime rib, stuffed pork rack, turkey breast, tri-tip, rotisserie chicken - tender, succulent and delicious
Seafood - Oyster, crab, shrimp, paella, crawfish, seafood bouillabaisse, lobster bisque - One word ""Awesome""
Mac N Cheese - fabulous, gourmet quality so creamy and cheesy.
Sushi - average and sushi rice kind of dry
Crawfish - not fresh and lacks Cajun spices.
Asian Stations - kalbi short ribs, pansit (rice noodles, cabbage, carrots, chicken, soy), oxtail soup, baked mussels - authentically good!
Salads - fajita salad, Greek salad, Caesar, Asian shrimp, ahi sashimi, beet salads - excellent
Mexican - Posole (Hominy, Pork) - authentic, comforting and muy Sabroso.

The desserts are fabulous and probably the best in Vegas. This is the only place that I know where I can fill my plate full of desserts and end up eating everything off my plate. It's incredibly good - especially cream brulee, cupcakes, tiramisu, cannoli and pistachio raspberry shooters. Italian Gilatto - mango, coconut and pistachio are definitely must try. 


Overall - 5 star. When you go to Vegas, they say the house always win. But when it comes to buffet, Studio B is truly the best. It's the only place that I know that Lady Luck will definitely be on your side cause the food is awesome. Just keep the food and booze coming.",6,1,1

We came on a saturday night so we could do the seafood buffet ($33 per person) since it's only offered on the weekend.

Since this place is off the strip, we figured the wait wouldnt be bad, but we were wrong. Wait was about an hour. So don't come starving. Come semi-hungry & have your hunger build as you wait in line.

FOOD
They had a very good variety, but probably the most popular items are their crab legs & prime rib. The crab is very fresh, unfortunately the shell is only cracked a little. So you have to do a little work to enjoy your food. (I'm a little spoiled from the other vegas buffets doing it for me) LOL.

The prime rib was so good! Not overcooked, not overly bloody. The perfect medium. =) That's usually hard to find especially eating prime rib in a buffet setting.

They also had a good selection of italian (pasta, gnoochi, pizzas), mediterranean (pita & humus), chinese, japanese, american, mexican, & even hawaiian. I loved the kahlua pork. It was really tender & juicy meat!

Of course the most notable is their wine\/beer bar. It's included in the price unlike other vegas buffets. It's unlimited! Bummer it's located away from the strip so you can't walk back to your hotel. =p. Overall quality was good & they had a good selection to choose from. Even had dessert wines! =)

DESSERT. Always my favorite station in any buffet. They had ready made crepes (not made to order. DARN!), cakes, fruit tarts, creme brulee, & gelato bar! Another notable thing is they even offer drinks like cappuccinos with your dessert =). You get it at the dessert bar for these specially made drinks

SERVICE
Our server was good. Tables were cleared off & refills given in a timely manner.

AMBIANCE
Overall, it looked like a big, modern cafeteria setting. HAHA. Don't get me wrong it's nice. But the way it's structured with the food centrally located in an open circular room made it feel very cafeteria-ish.

Definitely would come back to get away from the strip & have some good dining.",1,1,1

They also have Chinese food, Sushi, prime rib, leg of lamb, smoke turkey, and lots of salad and dessert choices. 

The prime rib was excellent! Tender and flavorful. I got the smoked turkey with Brussels sprouts and a best salad. I also got a salad that had sweet potatoes in it and that was great.

For dessert I tried a few items, everything is served in bite size portions so get a few items. Carrot cake I didn't think was that good. It reminded me of a sheet cake that they cut into bite size pieces. I also tried a slice of homemade rocky road, I love chocolate and marshmallows. 

My husband got the chocolate gelato, they had lots of choices.

What blew my mind was... guess what, they had Chinese styled bokchoy. MY FAVORITE. And it was delicious! Of course, if you want to get your money's worth. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS go for the meat and seafood. I had about 3 plates filled with raw oysters and others with ham and prime ribs.

It's a seafood buffet so oysters are a plently, and you gotta get your fill of the prementioned legs; raw or steamed even, how's that for freedom? Oh and your choice of every type of cuisine around the world. From SUSHI, to CHOW MEIN, to OX TAIL, to PIZZA, it's all here. And all good. 
HAWAIIN food is represented as along is THAI, plus FRIED CHICKEN, so, AMERICAN?
Prices may seem steep, $30per and $23 for kids(ages 5-8), but worth every penny. Well it's never really worth it for kids anyways, not like they eat alot. 
Yes there is BEER, but you can't walk away with an armfull of 67 glasses, like the song says you take one down you pass it around 66 beers to go. 

Go go and go! Really one of the best buffets out there, and another reason why other countries hate us. Because of freedom.

On weekends--Friday Saturday and Sunday--Studio B has a Seafood Buffet, and for the same price that you're paying for The Buffet at The Wynn ($43 with tax on weekend), you get much, much more value.

Why is Studio B better than The Buffet at The Wynn?  Here's a few reasons why:

- Quality is much better than the Wynn buffet.  Overall, the meat & food quality is better at Studio B.

- More Variety: Studio B has a much more variety of dishes for you to choose from.

- Unlimited Beer & Wine: yep, one of the things I love about this place is that they serve unlimited All-You-Can-Drink beer & wine as part of your buffet meal that you've already paid for.  At the Wynn buffet, you'll have to buy beer or wine separately.


The thing I love most of about this buffet is that they have raw oysters.  (see photo)  Yum...unlimited raw oysters!  I must have had over 35 raw oysters, which could have easily costed me $50 right there.  The oysters, however, weren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.  They come out somewhat fresh...but at least fresh enough to be good to eat.  But you'll have to pick them out individually from the buffet tray.  Add a nice squeeze of lemon and maybe a touch of cocktail sauce and you should be good.  It's still good, and above all a great value for what you're paying.

I also had Alaskan Crab Legs, which was very good. (see photo)  The hot butter sauce here has a nice little touch of sweetness to it that complements crab legs and brings out the taste of meat pretty well.  The slightly sweeter sauce is much better than the sauce at the Wynn buffet, which is just plain butter sauce.  The Alaskan Crab Legs quality was about the same here at Studio B and The Buffet at The Wynn.

We also picked up a plate of Crawfish (see photo).  I'd have to say that this was my only disappointment.  The Crawfish, unfortunately, wasn't fresh.  Instead, it was frozen.  It definitely makes a big difference in taste, but I can't really complain for the price I'm paying for this buffet and for what I'm already getting.  I guess we'll stick to The Boiling Crab in So Cal for crawfish.  So far that's the best place for it (as far as I know).

The Prime Rib was good as well.  The meat quality at Studio B seems to be a little better than the meat quality at The Buffet (at The Wynn).  The meat is more moist and juicy.  The prime rib I had at The Buffet seemed a slightly dry.  It was still ok, but it was a little dryer than Studio B's prime rib.


Everything else here was great!  They have such a great variety of food here, and the quality of everything is also great!  You really do get a good bang out of your buck here at Studio B, and I'd recommend this place to anyone....so far, this is the overall + seafood buffet in Vegas! :)",12,4,4

#1 Prime Rib - Wait for a fresh one and get the end cut.  You will not be disappointed.  Tasted so damn good that I didn't even want au jois or A1 or Tabasco.  I didn't want to spoil the taste with other sauces, even if they help enhance it. Best Prime rib I have ever eaten, melts in your mother fucking mouth! *WARNING*  Do not, I repeat Do NOT, start with this dish first, it will ruin everything else in the buffet for you because it is so damn good.  By the end of my meal I went back for seconds.

#2 Mac and Cheese One of the best Mac and Cheeses I have ever tasted.  Enough said.

#3 Maybe the Green Sauce and Pork in the Mexican section, this was pretty good, soft pieces of pork.

Other dishes that stood out was the sweet mashed potatos with marshmallows, Clams, Mussels, and Tempura Shrimp.
 
Everything else was so-so.  Even so it is still one of the buffets you must hit up.  I'm not sure if it is the best in Vegas, but I was not disappointed.

The deserts:  Chocolate Rice Krispies and Gelato.  The Ice Cream was great.

$26 a person on a Weekday, free Wine and Beer.

We went on a slow weekend so the line required only ~15 minutes of waiting. While waiting in line, I learned that Studio B served unlimited alcohol, which is a huge plus for alcohol consumers. The food itself was mediocre at best. The prime rib is something I always look forward to eating at Vegas buffets. However, it was completely tasteless. In fact, I would go as far as stating that it did not even taste like normal beef in regards to texture. The crab legs were completely meatless. If you want good surf and turf, go elsewhere.

We had planned to go once for dinner and once for lunch, but a poor experience with an unusually unprofessional server led to our receiving a free visit. 

Other than the one poor server, the other staff were great- attentive and unobtrusive. The buffet offers free beer, wine and champagne, with rotating varieties, so you   are limited to what is offered the day you visit, however, we have no complaints about what was available. 

There is a wide variety of normal buffet offerings, such as pizza, carved meats, salads, and international sections dishes representing Asia, Mexico, Italy. I was surprised to find pho, which was very good the first night, and still good, though not as flavorful, the second. My partner loves crab legs and said their's was good, but was disappointed that they are sliced open ahead of time. The fruit was fresh and plentiful. 

We noticed there was only one person at the carving station, leading to long waits and people abandoning the line without seeing a carver. They really needed two people on duty there. 

The deserts were nice- not as boring as other buffet desserts, as they had a wider variety of offerings. The coconut macaroons were delicious! We didn't try the ice cream but it was quite popular.  

The seafood buffet is over $30 per person, and we would only have tried it only once were it not for the comp, as that is too expensive in our opinion.

So me and a couple of buddies decide to roll to Vegas for my buddy's birthday.  Normally when I go to Vegas I make it a point to go to Hash House A Go-Go because I love their food.  Well, looks like there's a new candidate for my favorite spot to eat at when in Vegas.

The M Resort is off the strip, but regardless of that fact, it's a beautiful hotel.  It's nice, clean, doesn't smell too much like smoke (a plus if you've ever been in a Vegas casino), and best of all....the famous M Buffet, or Studio B Buffet!  I've heard about this place before from a lot of friends, so I pretty much knew that it'd be good food, but it wasn't until I was in the line grabbing my food that the awesomeness started settling in.

The first thing that caught my eye was the seafood.  I'm asian so I love crab legs, oysters, and muscles.  Needless to say that was the first thing that I grabbed.  They also had so much meat!  Beef, chicken, pork, fish, etc.  If it wasn't extinct, then it was probably being served...haha!  Salads, ehh...not much of a salad person, but hey they had your typical salads, pasta salads, fruit salads, etc.  Pastries were awesome, as well as your regular kids foods like pizza, fries, chicken wings, etc.  I still get those!  The best part is....all you can DRINK beer and wine.  Yup, that's right!  Beer and wine is included in the price.  The desserts were really good too.  Everything I tried was just really good.  The gelato was pretty awesome too.  I thought I saw red velvet gelato and I almost cried tears of joy, but it turned out to be strawberry...I cried a little in the inside though...haha.  All in all, food galore!

This place exceeded my highest expectations.  I was a bit skeptical thinking that no buffet was worth $30, when I could just go to other buffets that are like $15.  I was definitely proven wrong.  I paid $30 for a buffet that was worth every single cent.  This is a place that I'm definitely going to go to everytime I'm in Vegas.  So check it out for yourself.  It's not that far of a drive from the strip.  It's a beautiful, classy hotel with some bomb food.

Normally this buffet is $25, but for the week leading up to Christmas, they increased the buffet to $40, which includes unlimited drinks, by including deluxe items such as prime rib, crab legs, and an oyster bar. Like I do at most buffets, I look for food quality, variety, and overall value. 

Quality: 3\/5 
Not sure how to feel about the food quality. The oysters were atrocious. Not fresh in the slightest. Having paid $40, I definitely expected much better oysters. As for other seafood, the shrimp was fresh, but the cooked mussels were extremely overdone. On the bright side, the prime rib was tasty and cooked to a nice medium rare. So  I guess some of the items are hit or miss. 

Variety: 4\/5
There's a lot, a lot of food here. Aside from the previously mentioned, there's lamb roast, turkey, oxtail soup, a bunch of other soups, an entire salad bar, a dessert bar, and over 10 kinds of gelato. Not enough? There's a build-your-own pho station, korean short ribs, and much, much more. Unfortunately, there is barely any sushi. When I was there, they were only serving 3 rolls, and there is no sashimi. 

Overall Value: 3\/5
Eh. Like I said, if I'm paying $40, I want to be rewarded with some quality food. Studio B just doesn't deliver that consistently. Combined with the fact that you have to trek over 10 miles from the Strip to get here, I would recommend going to the Bellagio, Wynn, or some other resort on the Strip for your buffet needs.",1,1,1

On my most recent visit yesterday, I was not nearly as impressed,  At $16.95, the price is great....this includes unlimited beer, wine, and coffee bar with Irish Creme, Kahlua, etc.  The wine and beer selection is limited and does not include any premium beers or wines.  The one beer I had was a M Resort beer (brewed just for them) and the bartender said it was similar to Heineken.  It did taste similar to Heineken but was served room temperature in a warm glass.   The wine was ""house wine"" but not too bad.  The coffee bar is great with a barista serving up Irish Creme cappucino...very tasty.  The soups were good and so were some of the entrees.  My main disappointment was in the freshness of some of the entrees.  The Pad Thai seemed old and the noodles were hard, all the meat at the carving stations, including leg of lamb, and pork roast were extremely dry.  Many of the other meat entrees were also dry.  Not many of the entrees stood out as delicious to me.  My favorites were the sushi, Shepherd's Pie and Paella.  You'll definitely find something you like here and the $16.95 price is great (more on the weekends during their seafood buffet), but I believe the quality of this buffet has gone down significantly since the M Resort opened.",0,0,0

1.) Go For Lunch- $14.95 
best deal I think after all if you go anywhere else pretty decent it will cost at least that for an entree & drink 

2.) WINE & BEER INCLUDED!!!! 
So for all those nursing a hangover or gettin' in early...and can drink..makes it soo worth it. Please tell me what other Buffet offers this for lunch? 2 beers on tap (lager & coors I think?); & cheap wine red, white & zin 

3.) Gelato & Cafe Latte w\/ your choice of regular syrup or spiked w\/ Baileys or Kahlua 

4.) My focus was the ahi poke, mussels, beef ribs, pork ribs, & fried shrimp. 
The rest of the Buffet is meh- regular I thought..but just depends on what you like 

Conclusion - come here if you'll at least spend $15 on lunch anywayz. Gets a bit busy so expect a wait of at least 20 min. on a weekday.

Although it's inside the M Resort, it's not ""M Buffet."" It's the Studio B Buffet, and it's still at least a pretty solid B after all the years. It's been at least 2 if not 3 years since my last visit, which was also a group meal. For today's function though, we reserved that private, auditorium-esque room near the dessert section, and they had one server pretty much locked in on our room (but two would've been faster). Based on the cost we were told to contribute, including tax and tip, I'm pretty sure we got the normal $39.99 seafood dinner rate (Friday 2:30-8:30, Saturday & Sunday 11:00-8:30).

As I typically do at buffets, I walked around to look at everything and only committed to small portions of items until I was able to figure out what I really wanted. Most of my choices ended up being seafood, meat, more seafood, and more meat... and dessert, of course.

Crab legs have always been one of my buffet go-to items, and they're still pretty good here. They pre-cut the legs, and they actually have three preparations: cold, steamed (hot), and ginger (also hot, on the other side in the Asian section); I stuck to the steamed legs. Although the meat-to-shell ratio tends to be small, the quality and salt level are pretty good. I've never found the warm butter strictly necessary, and it wasn't today, but it's nice to have anyway.

In terms of other seafood, there's not much to write home about. I skipped the oysters. The shrimp was small and bland (definitely helped to have butter). The swai in cream sauce was boring. The baked mussels were pretty dry. The fried calamari were fine. Lobster bisque (yes, a soup) was decent although I inadvertently grabbed a slice of sourdough bread, which I typically don't like; this held true today.

I enjoyed several of the meat selections. The prime rib was pink and tender, if a bit fatty in some parts. The New York steak was medium and tender, and it's fine as long as you don't forget to grab the mushrooms and onions. The kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) was tender enough and marinated fairly well for a buffet, and there was a pork rib that was also yummy and tender. The oxtail soup was good, but I've had better. Didn't get back around to try the pho, unfortunately, although I suspect it probably wouldn't have been that great.

I don't typically get too many savory carb items at buffets, but the fingerling potatoes w\/ salmon (near the shrimp) was pretty delicious. It was among the most flavorful of the dishes that I tried today.

Dessert was where I really went nuts, which is appropriate because they have a huge variety of items. My favorites were the bread pudding (scoop it from a huge pan), the chocolate hazelnut cup, and the Oreo cup. The mango panna cotta was also really good. I also would definitely get the chocolate-covered marshmallows, creme brulee, and cannoli again if pressured. I enjoyed the ice creams that I selected (rum raisin and seasonal pumpkin) but just don't find them appealing compared to dedicated shops. The cream puff also is significantly inferior to outside selections, and the chocolate lava cake was a little too doughy.

Note that they still have the free alcohol selection near the front, as well as the coffee bar next to the ice cream; tipping is highly recommended though. The cider was a favorite of my friends, and I found it reasonably sweet. As for the coffee, I ordered a latte for some reason when I'm sure I would've preferred an Americano or straight coffee. Oh well, live and learn.

I'd rather pony up for the big buffets on the Strip if I'm gonna go out of my way, but Studio B remains a pretty solid choice that might have more manageable lines. Barely anyone was lined up in advance of the 11am Saturday opening, and it didn't seem to get that crowded until later on in the meal. If you're going to buffets often enough that you need to build a rotation, then do include Studio B in that list.",13,5,9

However by the time we left the line looked to be running closer to 45 minutes.

The buffet is easily the best food especially for value in Las Vegas or for that matter anywhere I've been. $15.99 for lunch includes unlimited wine, beer or hard cider! Are you kidding me? On top of that the food always seems fresh vs. other buffets where you can visually see the sauces and fat not marinating at the top of buffet offerings. 

Some of the highlights gnocchi, clams, paella and fish offerings. The dessert bar is unreal. Beautifully crafted custards, creme brulee and tasty gelatos. You can also get your coffee with a spike of Irish Cream in it. Unheard of for a buffet.

The dining area is simple, attractive and has a nice flow. There never seems to be a line of bunched up people for any offering which is quite nice. 

I still haven't figured out what the ""classroom"" looking studio is for or when it gets used, but that's okay because I'm so busy eating my four quarters (plates) of food as if I were playing linebacker for a gourmet buffet eating team.

 I will always make my way there whenever I get to Vegas. The only hard part for out of towners is that you will need a car to get there, as it's as far down Las Vegas Blvd as it gets before you are on your way south down I-15.

They also have all you can drink wine and beers and have a special ""draft"" root beer. Its really good. The only bummer is you have to go up and get these drinks yourself. All other drinks will be brought to the table by your waitress.

There was a short line once my friend and I arrived then more and more people started to come, once we thought it was our turn to pay, the cashier lady told us to go behind the sign to the back behind everyone else (basically to the back of the line) we were confused as fuck because how the hell would we have known that the line we were in was the waiting for a table AND the paying line both combined together?! I guess she didn't realize that we were the first in line to pay even though we stood there in front of her face for 15-20 minutes, she kept telling us to go behind the sign, which made no sense because that meant that we had to allow the 6, 7, 8 people behind us to cut us, which was totally unfair! We kept on questioning her but she continued to say the same shit so we gave up and went to the back of the line. 

Pretty funny though how once we thought we were already at the end of the line, two ladies glared and decided to walk around us to stand in front of us and as they did so they said ""omg they cut us"" yeah okay bitch like we intended to, you want to be in front? go ahead! 
But this part made my day: minutes later, a couple with a baby stroller who were fourth in line when we were first in line, the mother went out've her way to bring us back to the front, she said, ""I saw how the cashier treated you girls and that's unfair for you both to go to the back of the line when you were first!"" So she led us to stand in front of them, 
THEN MY FRIEND AND I SAID EXCUSE ME TO THOSE TWO BITCHES AND LOOOOOOOOLLL THEIR FACE OF EMBARRASSMENT

I've been coming here since they opened and I can tell you they haven't skimped on the quality. 

Some of my faves:
1. Crab legs: they've got two stations, hot and cold. Served with melted butter (not for me). These used to come with shell crackers until they started shaving them open. I used to think this new procedure distracted from the fun, but now it just gets more crab legs in my belly in less time.
2. Prime Rib: so juicy and so tender. Get the rare cut and add some horseradish to that thug. You won't be disappointed.
3. Beer and wine: the selection has increased since I first visited. Always included and always unlimited.
4. Sushi\/sashimi: while it is buffet quality, it's still delish. Hint: ask for a bowl of sashimi to skip on the carbs!
5. Desserts: self explanatory
6. Espresso and coffee bar: ask for a shot of kahluha or Baileys with your coffee and dessert!

Prime rib - Cooked perfectly - super juicy, pink in the middle... no need for sauces or creams, this is awesome as is - droooool...

Pork loin - this was OK, not as juicy as others I've had but it had good flavor. This definitely needed the gravy. With the gravy it was delicious.

Mexican bean and corn salad - really fresh tasting, perfectly seasoned and the jalapeños added the perfect amount of heat.

Creme brûlée - Sweet Jesus this was awesome! Really creamy, the crystallized sugar on the top was perfectly caramelized ... Definitely went back for seconds!

They also have different flavors of gelato, steak, sushi, calamari, chinese food and everything else your heart desires. Quick note on the crab legs - they were tasty but good luck trying to get them, lots of people hoard them, taking SEVERAL PLATES of them at a time.

Atmosphere: Fairly new and pretty spacious. Nothing too fancy, but it does look nice. You can start from anywhere within the buffet - there's no clear path.

Food: They have a variety of pretty much all types of food. The crab legs are fresh and pre-cracked and opened for you, which is awesome. The meats were pretty satisfying. Everything else (desserts included) was average - nothing too memorable, but definitely of better quality for a buffet. Unlimited wine and beer (select flavors)? I'll drink to that!

The crab legs are pre-cut! I'm usually not into crab legs all that much but I got like 3 plates haha, super easy to eat. Towards the bottom of the bin they were pretty salty though.

The pasta I wouldn't waste my time on, it was all watered down. The meatballs were pretty good but yeah I wasn't impressed at all.

I thought all of the meat were good though. I was begging for a steak of some sort, all they had was a mostly med rare prime rib, but that was good at least. Both ribs I had were great, barbecue and then one asian style. The chickens were the meat stars - honey, roast, jerk.

The brochure said there were 200 dishes yet I didn't really feel like there were, mostly because there were so many kinds of salads they were probably including in that, I wish they had had more sides or entree meats to make up that 200.

They have free beer and wine btw, better get on that :)

I was bummed when she said we'd be seated in the back booth because it's far from everything, but actually I think it's better. Less crowded to maneuver through, but more importantly a romantic wall to wall view of Vegas 

The desserts are so cute, they were all unnecessarily intricately decorated. Both my friend and I thought most everything was too sweet, but I loved the panacotta, and the chocolate covered marshmallows we're good.

I grabbed an ice cream cone on my way out, the rum raisin was very rummy haha, I wonder if they make the ice cream fresh

I've been to Studio B more than ten times and I swear, it never gets old for me.  Here's the thing though...I've never paid full price here (because price tends to take on a big role in distorting my opinion and discourages my generous star ratings).  Call me cheap, heck, I'll call MYSELF cheap, but I ain't paying over $25 for a buffet...that's a hard limit for me.  So, we go when and ONLY when we have our handy dandy BOGO deals that the Rewards Card people send out.

Ok, so we've established price is not my favorite thing about this place, let's just get the other unpleasantry out of the way...the amazingly ridiculous line that you often have to wait in.  Waiting in line to eat has to be one of the most miserable things EVER so, that being said, try to prepare yourself (we've waited for at least an hour and a half on one occassion).

I've been for breakfast once, but I'm not a breakfast person and enjoy the lunch and dinner buffets quite a bit more, so this review is sort of geared more toward those two.  For starters, the place is big, bright, beautiful and pretty modern-looking.  It never looks dirty even though it's constantly crowded.  Also, the servers here are some of the NICEST and fastest people I've come across in the big booming buffet industry.

Now, to the food...I always start with their sushi-type rolls, Hawaiian poke and the lomi lomi (salmon) -- this fills my plate.  My second plate is MORE lomi lomi and all the Asian food I can pile onto my plate.  If there are crab legs, those are next.  I also appreciate the Mediterranean, Mexican, Seafood and soul food.

After I've decided I can't stuff anymore lomi lomi mixed with other foods into my belly, I head over to the dessert section and go straight to the tiramisu.  I grab a few cookies, crepes if they're making them, mini souffle, gelato (to wash down the souffle), and a fresh to order cappuccino.

Anyways, we got there at about 7pm and the line was just crazy, we decided to stick it out and whoa! it was worth the wait. Everything in the buffet is gourmet status, well, most things at least. My favorite item was the gnocchi, the sauce on it tasted freshly made. The table that we got had a view of the strip and apparently it is somewhat difficult to get this spot.

You have to wait in line to pay, then wait in another line for the hostess to seat you. For some reason, the wait in the second line was just as long as, if not more than, the first! What's frustrating is seeing empty tables once you do get it because it makes you wonder why you're standing in line when there is obviously seating. I hope managment figures out how to shorten the wait.

Once you get inside though, the food is amazing! There is a huge variety - something for everyone. The quality is superb, fresh, and well prepared. I would have liked to have seem more vegetable side dishes, but there were plenty of salads. I just couldn't get enough of their mashed potatoes and gravy or their fried shrimp. And their cocktail sauce? Great kick - loved it! Fried chicken was chrispy on the outside, juicy inside. 

Now dessert...fabulous! Portions were perfectly sized and there was a nice variety. The quality was there - there was nothing generic about their sweets. In fact, I judge a buffet by that little extra it puts into its dessert selection, and Studio B goes the extra mile. Oh, and did I mention they have gellato?

In each case I ordered iced tea which never was served and the used plates were not removed. In both instances, it was the SAME Waitress! Although observably she had ample time to socialize with other guests at great length, she never once came over to bring my tea or to clear the plates. Since this was the second occurrence of this unacceptable level of service in the very same month, I asked another waiter to bring a manager over.  When the manager arrived she brought the inattentive waitress with her who began to apologize for not providing my iced tea. I said ""the main issue here is that YOU did this very same thing when I ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago"". She then became silent and the manager said ""we do apologize sir"".  Later, I relayed this incident to my casino host who informed me that he had contacted the primary manager of the buffet and that I would be hearing from him shortly. A week went by and I was never contacted. I mentioned this to my host and he said that a VP would be contacting me soon. Unsurprisingly, I was never contacted by anyone.

Located at the M, go during the lunch hours to avoid long lines during dinner.  Seafood buffet is offered all weekend for $39.99 offering shrimp, crabs and oysters.

Now to go into why I don't think this buffet is all that great is that they really don't offer anything special in terms of food.  Oysters? Crabs? Shrimp? these are available in almost any las vegas buffet.  The other choices of food are pretty standard (salad bar, pizza, asian).  They offer ""sushi' which is a paper thin slab of cheap fish they put on a big mound of rice.  The soup here is good in particular the miso soup but no one pays that much for miso soup.  My previous review of the bellagio buffet earns its high ratings because of king and snow crab options, steak tartar, pesto shrimp pizza, rack of lamb and real cuts of sushi.  

Yes they do offer free alcohol (beer, wine and alcohol cider) but to me, its not a big wow factor. The cider they serve here is really good, I would recommend trying that than any other alcoholic options.

Dessert area is okay but nothing spectacular

B studio has an excellent and never-ending stock of snow crab legs. They are cut in a half for easy eating and offered HOT or COLD! 

The oysters were NOT good. They should be shucked upon request or in smaller amounts. A lot of the oyster were dried out and had pieces of shell in it.

The rest of the seafood offerings were nothing crazy and I really did not care for it. They have tuna poke, cocktail shrimp, ceviche, and much more. 

The buffet has a wide selection of cuisines ranging from Chinese to American. I'm enjoyed the oxtail stew they had! But the fried items were not very crispy. I felt that a lot of their food were stale and needed to be changed out.

Their meat selection is plentiful but nothing to write home about. Lots of beef, sausage, turkey to keep you satisfied. I enjoyed this very much!

I am not a big dessert guy but if you are, I'd recommend you to check it out. Tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake, marshmallows, and lots of baked goods.

Several Thai and Vietnamese salads are uncommon elsewhere.  Many good Italian dishes, both hot and room-temp.  Overall, so many things are made well; it's about quality.

It no longer serves breakfast, so finding any eggs is difficult.  But if you look hard enough, you'll find chunks of egg in the Singapore noodles.

And, a make-to-order espresso bar that goes with all those sweets (tiny Tiramisù, crepes, crème brûlée...).  But the line can be long because desserts and coffee are in the same place; the person manning the espresso bar also has to scoop gelato.

Now, for the food. It was all top quality, especially for a buffet. Because I am obsessed I mostly focused on the seafood, but there was plenty of other stuff as well.

Awesome fresh seafood - oysters, hot crab legs, cold crab legs. Their cioppino is to die for. I love that they have mozzarella\/tomato salad, as well as stuffed grape leaves (how often do you find those in buffets that are actually GOOD?), as well as calamari, fresh meat cuts, their salmon on a smoked plank, and unlimited drinks (including wine and beer).

I can say that I enjoyed it alot better before it became popular (especially with the locals) because the line can be well over 2 hours long.

Our most recent trip to the buffet was on Christmas eve. We waited in line for over an hour and it was a total clusterf#$k. The line was unbelievably disorganized. The people who had already paid and were waiting to be seated were blocking the path of the people waiting to pay. Because of this the cashiers were not calling people up to the counter to pay and the line seemingly didn't move for an hour. I was scolded by the cashier when I dared to walk up to the counter without being summoned. Our total wait time was 1 1\/2 hours, but when we were led into the dining room there were many empty tables. The line could move more efficiently if they would put some sort of system in place and possibly remodel the entrance to the buffet where people queue and pay.

Aside from the logistics, the buffet itself is good but not great. For the price it is a good value considering it includes all you can drink beer and wine. My favorite items at the buffet are the Tomato Basil soup and the sweet potatoes. I sat next to a man and watched him down 4 bowls of the tomato soup...it really is that good.

Other than that the prime rib is good, and everything else is hit and miss. Like any other buffet some items are better than others. The desserts are good.

I went here Sunday, paid the EXUBERANT PRICE of 44.00 per person after taxes and the spread there was disgusting... everything looked old, not fresh, and well.. disgusting!

The meat station barely had any meats, the crab leg section had no refills of crab the whole time I was there, the raw oysters when they were even put out fresh looked disgusting and also looked like they would just give you botulism by just smelling them! everything was terrible and I feel like we got RIPPED OFF... 

This is the WORST buffet I've been to in the LAS VEGAS VALLEY area... I don't care if it's in Henderson or not, or the last place you see as you're heading south out of las Vegas, KEEP DRIVING PAST THE THING cause by then you've already passed up everything else that is worth making a turd for... 

stay away, far away, the fact that there was no line there is showing how bad this buffet has become over the past year...",4,2,1

The only downside is that the line gets ridiculously long. We waited an hour and a half... but what's a Vegas buffet without the wait?

The food was good. We were starving by the time we got in, so everything tasted amazing. The prime rib was a little dry and too well done for my liking, but it was still good with the au jus and the horseradish. Crab legs...well, I can eat those for days. I did get a lot of the korean style short ribs. It was very delicious!! I don't personally eat oysters, but they didn't look as fresh and my friend also said that they didn't taste as good. All the other things I tried were pretty good (oxtail soup, fried gyozas, lobster mac&cheese, shrimp scampi, veggie pad thai, stuff I don't remember)

Their desserts bar is decent. I love love getting all the desserts in the little cups. My favorite is the panna cotta with the rasberry compote on top. The pistachio one with chocolate is pretty good too. I didn't really try any of the baked goods. They have THAI TEA GELATO.. which taste exactly like thai tea. so yummy. 

UNLIMITED ALCOHOL!! They don't have an extensive list of alcohol available but they do have a variety. I believe they have a red\/white wine, champagne, cider, and beer. They also have this root beer (non-alcoholic) that is very good. It's like one of those hand crafted root beers..not like A&W. 

Overall, great food and great price. Even if you had to pay the $40.. it's not bad for a seafood buffet and unlimited alcohol. I would definitely come here again! :)",3,2,3

They are only available on friday night, saturday night, and sunday brunch. You can get them steamed or chilled. They are available both ways. These are the snow crab legs and they are HUGE. I like these better than the king crab legs because they have more flavor. Aside from the the crab legs, the whole buffet is like heaven. You'll find everything from sushi, to chinese food, to curry, pizza, soup, steaks and even bamboo steamed fish. Probably one of the best varieties of food I've ever seen in a buffet.  Everything tastes so good. If you want to try everything, you will need to keep your portions small so you can have everything and still have room for their wonderful dessert bar. They also have all you can drink beer and wine. Defeats the point if you just want to drink a lot of beer. You don't want to get to full too fast.

The dessert bar is awesome! Fresh made macaroons, a variety of chocolate, tiramisu, and other flavors of dessert shooters. The chocolate soufflé and crème brulée were so good. The flan was good too. The also had different flavors of meringues. To finish off your meal, they also have a coffee bar. You can have an Irish coffee, Kalua coffee or whatever else the bartender can create. I suggest a Latte.

The line to get in is usually long for dinner. Expect to wait over an hour if you are going on a friday or saturday night. I usually try to get there between 4:00 and 5:00. Then the line isn't as bad. I got there after 6 one time and I waited in line for almost 2 hours. I got there around 10:30 for Sunday brunch and the line wasn't very long.

I think not. It's $40 for weekends seafood buffet from 11am to 9pm. It is definitely not worth the $40. Take that money and go to the Wynn buffet. 

Kalbi short ribs were soooo salty. It wasn't even tolerable by downing a lot of water. I had to spit it out onto a napkin because it was just sodium overload. I got really excited when I saw the sashimi salad with huge chunks of salmon sashimi. But the salmon was hard and not buttery soft. I felt like they took it from the freezer.  The lobster bisque and chicken noodle soups were both really salty. After 2 plates of disappointment, I slowed down and stopped eating. Such a disappointment after all that hype. 

The presentation of the food definitely looks better than it tastes. I was so excited upon entering because I thought the quality & taste would be comparable to other buffets in the same price range. After a few bites, I was proven wrong.

Came here for Sunday Champagne brunch as always when in vegas and every time it seems to get a little worse and some how more expensive. It started out very good, everything i tried used to be so flavorful, moist, and well seasoned. I guess the owners sold the place off and the money hungry big shots got a hold of it. 

Had a comp buffet plus a line pass for 4 ppl, so you're supposed to get treated as a special guest. We got in with no wait, but had to wait 15 mins while they sat people from the regular line before us. When they finally did seat us we walked in with a few other groups something like a 10 top, a 6 top, and 2 4 tops. They kinda seemed like they weren;t even expecting us. They sat us and we never got a server so after 15 mins I flagged someone down and he was kinda annoyed which is funny cause he was supposed to be our server in the first place. Go figure right? So even with some crappy service we still tipped 18% at a buffet, where most ppl tip like 5 bucks. Plus i spent about $20 in tip on the lady serving us alcohol. 

Food 
* The Good. Charcuterrie, cold cut selection is not too shabby, salami, capicolla, ham, the cheese selection is a big plus because of the smoked gouda, and 5year aged gouda which are my favorites. Mimosas (self explanatory). 
* The Bad. Clam chowder potatoes were undercooked, little watery for a chowder. Prime rib\/turkey. Both were mediocre and cut paper thin. 
* The Ugly. Crab Legs- the main reason i used to go to this buffet. Hot snow crab clusters which were perfectly steamed and delicious. NOW, they break them all off the cluster, and cut them in half. This does 3 things to the crab. Takes away all the flavor, make's it dry, and makes it impossible to get the meat out of the shell in one piece ( which is what makes eating snow crab legs so fun to eat) 

Overall. Service sucks, Food starting to really suck, only good thing i can recommend is When ordering mimosas from the wine lady. Give her  5-10 bucks and ask her to put them in the beer glass instead of the little champagne flutes. Yes you will look like an alcoholic, but at least you'll look like a smart alcoholic :). It also makes it easier on her and saves you extra trips to the bar.",0,0,0

The lady who was making  the cutoff for the last person in line denied us and referred us to the manager Anthony Fakhri. He is just about the RUDEST manager I've ever encountered in my entire life. 

There are ways to go about things in the service industry and this man should seriously consider another profession.

I was thrilled while I waited in line a few days ago in anticipation of the familiar embrace between the glorious food and my eager tastebuds. 

However, the eagerness started to fade as I waited in line. And waited. And waited. And waited some more. Turns out, if you have more than a party of four, you have less of a priority than a party of four or less! I watched as parties of four or less kept getting seated faster and faster while my family and I continued to wait in a separate line! A family I noticed that arrived much later than us was seated before us! Imagine watching them seat two party of fours instead of our party of five. Incredible display of seating prioritization. (Sarcasm) 

Anyways we were finally seated and received our drinks and got our first plate of food. My grandma ordered cranberry juice. I don't know how this is possible, but the moment my grandma lifted up her glass, the entire lower half of the glass cracked open and I watched in horror as the liquid exploded onto our food and some of it went onto our stuff. Thankfully the staff immediately helped us clean up, but by this point I was in such a foul mood and I haven't even tasted a crumb of our food yet. Note to staff: please check for the quality of your glassware and see if it is competent to actually keep hold of the liquid inside. 

Anyways, as always, I am impressed by the variety of the food. I remembered not being able to try one of everything here because there is way too much to choose from. Not a bad thing at all in my book, but I was a bit disappointed that none of the food really stood out to me as much as I remembered. My sister loved the pho though.

Although I'm not a huge drinker I thought it did make a good impression.  However it's not that clearly defined and many diners didn't seem aware of it (I was approached several times while walking back to my table with a glass of cider to inquire where I got it and how much?) 

I actually had a comped meal so I didn't have to wait in line, so no complaints regarding the wait.  I believe it was $21 during weeknight dinner, which I think is a bargain for a Vegas area buffet.  

One thing I hated was the ambiance and layout.  It's sort of circular with no clear direction of where to start so there were some line cutting issues with pushy old asian ladies (sorry for the specific callout, but my aunties are one of them so I know the type!).  I absolutely hated the dining room area.  It felt like a cafeteria or mall food court.  loud and not cozy or comfortable.  Large billboard like screens flank one entire wall of the restaurant.  hideous.

The food is decent, with a few standout dishes.  (the cedar plank salmon was delicious and I generally do not like salmon!).  They offer the usual selections of italian, mexican, carving station, lots of salads and soups, fried seafoods, and mix of asian cuisines.  The Sushi selection was pretty fresh and constantly replenished.  However I objected to the plates being warm as I like my raw fish chilled slightly (I went and got a small dessert plate as those are not warmed).  

The alcohol station is not marked and is sort of tucked behind the soups and breads at the ""beginning"" of the buffet.  The house cider was really good, they had about 4 beers on tap and 4 different wines.  I had 1\/2 a glass of cider which was crisp and sweet with small tight champagne like fizz and a 1\/2 glass of cabernet which was ok.  

I didn't have any desserts but I noticed they were perfectly bite sized which is ideal at a buffet so you can try ALL OF THEM!!!  haha.  They also have an espresso bar with liquors, which is awesome.

When I'm in Sin City, I absolutely refuse to waste stomach space on mediocre. Almost everyone I know who are Vegas regulars recommends Studio B because they say the food is delicious (weekend seafood buffet?!), the price is just right, and the service is up to par. Annnd now I know why.

The food was ON POINT! Variety was out-of-this-world. Most notably amazing was the shrimp cocktail and some of the desserts (namely the gelato and crème brûlée). Food was constantly being restocked by the friendly staff behind the counters. I have always avoided the ""Asian"" inspired foods because they generally taste Americanized, but I will recommend the ones here (the shrimp pad thai's flavor was completely off though). The soups...oh my, the soups! The meats, too!

I failed to catch our server's name, but he was on his A-game! Even as tables filled up, he managed to bring us all refills many times before our cups were ever empty. Being the tough cookie to please as I am, I wanted a cherry coke; he accommodated my request by mixing coke with grenadine. Unlimited wine and beer at no extra charge, too. Uh, hello! Honestly, this was the best, most top-notch service I've ever received, and I know I won't forget it. It's too bad my parents were nit-picking with my tipping practices, and I'm still feeling suuuper guilty for not leaving my usual 20% because he deserved so much more! So mister server, if you see this, I am incredibly sorry!

Oh, and if you're a sucker for pretty things, you'll gush at the ceiling and elegance of the entire place. It was a lot smaller than I expected, especially after experiencing the buffet at Cesar's, but nothing here disappointed otherwise. Extremely modern decor, well-lit.

The buffet was $36.74, and it entails a seafood buffet wit an assortment of seafood like king crab, steamed crab, raw oyster, lobster( which they ran out of ... So i didnt even get to try it ... SO UPSETTING) ..there is also an wide assortment of food from american to chinese to thai food. The pad thai and curry were really delicious, the meat selection was not that great .. It was quite disappointing . The absolutely best thing was the mac & cheese ! That was the most delicious thing ! The lobster ravoli is good to.. The lobster bisque soup is so salty ,..

The desert bar was pretty okay and they have gelato canister which is pretty impressive. All the food was extremely salty or extremely sweet . They need to put less salt and sugar ... Seriously

The price includes alcohol but we were all to hung over so i wish they had a no alcohol option and made it cheaper.

Overall, i would not come back here .",0,0,0

We went on a Saturday night for their Seafood buffet.  The food was tasty.  It's probably impossible to try everything.  My rule of thumb, don't waste your time with common dishes.  You'll just fill your tummy up leaving less room for the good stuff (crab, prime rib, leg of lamb, oysters, etc) You also get free Alcohol with your buffet and coffee and cappuccino (which by the way, according to the coffee connoissuers in my dinner party were delicious) After speaking to the the barista apparently, this place has their own house blend of coffee and its unique.  By Vegas standards, the this buffet closes pretty early 8pm so if you're planning to go.  Make plans to go in early.  The yelp info says that they take reservations, how ever it's incorrect.

Studio B has a very unique setting. There is a TV studio inside and lots of TV screens all over the place. They were showing some show with Guy Fieri on the screens when we were there. The buffet is in the main room and faces the studio. A side room that is a little further from the buffet has windows with a spectacular view, especially at night. Some people waited a little longer to be sat in there.

The food is very good. We were there on seafood night so there were more seafood options. While the fancier dishes were good, it was some of the simpler items that really stood out. In particular, I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and the tomato bisque. The only disappointing section was the Asian food section. Everything tasted like there was too much sauce. Maybe it was an off night since usually Las Vegas buffets have good Asian sections due to it being a popular tourist destination for Asian tourists. The dessert line is poorly designed. Long lines form for the ice cream and coffee bar so thoe who just want to grab a cookie, slice of cake, or some of the very good flan have to either wait or awkwardly ask if we can go ahead.

It was about 12:30pm on Father's day, and after some confusion about where the line started (there was a MOB of people in front of the place), we asked a service lady what to do and where to go to line up. She said they were closing the line for this wave of seating, and we had to instead get a ""queue card"" that would let us GET IN LINE at 3pm. 

Wait up, say whaaaaat?! 

Normally this would have been a deal breaker, but this place is out in the middle of nowhere miles from the strip and any other decent buffets\/restaurants. I think she sensed the desperation in my eyes...and she politely told us, ""Well, the VIP line is also a line for people with disabilities. They won't ask what your disability is.""

Cha-Ching! Baby was that money. We whisked into that line, which was considerably shorter. My shameless, plotting Chinese mind then immediately started coming up with reasons someone in our party had a disability...we ended up slightly embarrassing my boyfriend's dad by explaining he had just had a hip replacement (which was true!) and couldn't stand in line for that long. The cashier was suuuper nice and didn't even bat an eyelash. She took our money and 15 minutes later we were in -- saving ourselves lots of grief! I was a very giddy girl indeed. *Note this will probably not work if you are young and healthy with a bunch of your young and healthy friends..so get there early to avoid lines? This place has blown up in popularity!*

Now, the next hour and a half are a blur for me.  

I remember king crab legs...lots and lots of crab legs (again, I am Chinese people!)  With melted butter and lemon...MmM...lots of different Asian foods...pad Thai, Korean BBQ ribs, satay, cucumber salad, sushi, a REALLY good tuna salad...uMMm and the standard prime rib and different types of meat, poultry and fish. Not a big fan of their prime rib, twas a little dry. Desserts were all amazing...they had individual size hot chocolate lava cake..this itty bitty chocolate pudding cup with oreo crumbs on top..mMm..and all these ice cream flavors...and you could ask them to make you a dessert coffee drink with coffee liquors! Like Baileys and whatnot..I should have gotten something..but alas was too full.

Fri-Sun is the seafood buffet and they had free beer, wine and champagne. To start I had the prime rib which was FANTASTIC. My slices was rare, soft, juicy and extremely flavorful which is everything you can ask for.. The chicken was juicy and not dry and they even had Paneer which is my favorite Indian dish.

Since imitation crab tastes exactly like very mushy real crab and costs infinitely less, I don't think this buffet can match the Spice Market, Bellagio, or Wynn buffets, and it costs just as much.  The line is just as long, too.  The entree dishes largely revolve around slight variations on the same handful of ingredients and will not blow your mind.  They're okay, but not $30 per person okay.

On a previous trip, we waited for a bit in line but realized it was going to take like 2 hours to get in.

On a later trip, we waited in line for about 30 minutes.

Perhaps my high expectations left me a bit disappointed. The kalbi was not as good was what would be found in any LA KBBQ institution. It was either too fatty or too chewy although the flavor was good. I think this is due to the fact that kalbi should be grilled and eaten immediately whereas the pans of meat may have been sitting out for a few minutes already.

However, upon further reflection & after trying other buffets, my family and I talked about how the quality of the food at this M buffet was quite good and that we enjoyed the food.

My favorites:
-- their roasted sweet potatoes
-- prime rib which was quite good although not terribly different than other places where the prime rib is good.
-- the pana cotta with passion fruit sauce and fresh diced mangoes. I ate several of these little cups.
--The unlimited Zinfandel wine mixed with hard apple cider. Yum! Too bad I only had one glass..hahaha. Too old to take advantage of the all you can drink.
--and thanks to the Yelp reviews here, I too made a fresh tap root beer, root beer float with vanilla bean gelato. Soooo good! I realize when someone wrote that they found it too sweet that root beer tends to be quite sweet in general. It didn't bother me though.",1,1,1

(scroll down for the summary if you don't feel like reading my review, lol)

If you are looking for a new buffet to try in Vegas, you have to come to Studio B Buffet! I've been here twice with the same group of friends and we all agree that this buffet is better than Wynn's and Bellagio's.  Studio B offers a wide selection and I must say, most of the items on the menu are very de-lish!! (Other buffets only have a couple of selections that are good).

If you come here, you must try their OXTAIL SOUP... it doesn't look as appetizing, but believe me, your tummy will be pleased and you'll be getting off your seat to get this from the buffet for Round 2.  :-)

Other dishes to try are the GINGER CRAB, Prime Rib (they cook this to perfection! I like mine Medium Rare to Medium Well), Crab Legs (both warm and cold), and BBQ (nothing spectacular but it does taste YUM-O!).

While other buffets have Soft-Serve Ice Cream, Studio B offers GELATO!!! Yup, they sure do! They have everything from Vanilla, Yogurt, Strawberry, Mango, Rum & Raisin, Chocolate, Coffee, to name a few.  A couple of my friends in our party really liked the Rum & Raising gelato but because  I don't like raisins, it was hard for me to like it as much as they did--- it wasn't bad overall.  What I did like was the MANGO Gelato! :)  From their dessert  bar, I also tried their Macaroons and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I'm very picky with how macaroons are made and the ones they make here are definitely worth trying. It's baked to perfection, just like their Chocolate Chip Cookies...Crisp and Chewy!

I must also mention they have FREE BEER & WINE included with the meal price ($29.99\/person.... I went here on a Sunday).

CONs:
-south of The Strip
-wait time depending on what time you arrive

PROs:
-nice being away from the strip
-located inside the beautifully-decorated M Resort
-Price is not bad compared to other locations
-Free Beer & Wine
-Gelato
-Food: Oxtail Soup, Ginger Crab, Prime Rib
-Cleanliness

Dessert: the only negative is that they run milk and white chocolate fountains but they are behind the counter and more like displays.  You can't seem to get any chocolate from anyone.  Good news: my dad is diabetic and got a host of sugar free desserts when he asked.  Gelato is very good too.

UPDATE: returned 7\/5 for seafood buffet.  My mom asked a chef how she can get access to the chocolate fountains.  He told her to wait and delivered white chocolate dipped strawberries to the table!!!  By the way, the panang is still amazing, the tempura sweet potatoes, the pad thai, the oysters, the salmon sashimi...still delicious!!!!",0,0,0

4.5! Possibly one of the best buffets in Vegas. It's located in the really nice, but also empty M Resort 10 miles off the strip.

I'm always skeptical of buffets with a large variety of ""ethnic foods,"" but everything was generally great. I especially loved the layout of this buffet! HUGE!

- A large island in the middle for meat carvings: prime rib (my fav!), mahi mahi cooked on a fancy bamboo stalk, roasted chicken, and more.
- The seafood stations divided by cold and hot. So the chilled crab legs were by the raw oysters and there was also hot crab legs, yay!

- Never ending dessert station. My friend and I looked at the tiny plates provided for the desserts, and we made a detour to grab some large plates: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=LR3Fm9zcy0ayy1BF4BikkA variety! 
Possibly 30% of what I consumed consisted of creme brulee....
- AYCE beer (on tap) and wine station. Didn't get to take advantage of this yet, but definitely will next time! They also have cider on tap
- Coffee bar at the end of the dessert station, so I ended my meal and desserts with a nice cappuccino.

I never have conversations with the people who prep and cook buffet foods, but the staff and cooks were so nice!

We waited in line for well over and hour for the seafood buffet, and it was rather expensive at $40 per person.
I'll get the good out of the way: included beer, wine and coffee.  If you consider just this point, it's probably worth it for the standard buffet price if you drink a lot.
Otherwise, this buffet was entirely disappointing, especially compared to other buffets I have experienced on the strip.  
There were no stand-outs with the food.  There was, however, certainly some inedible food, like the leg of lamb (extremely dry and gamey) and steak.  The crab was tasteless, most of the meat was dry and tough, there were hardly any interesting dishes, and the best things were just mediocre. The oxtail soup had a pretty nice flavor, but was rendered inedible by large pieces of star anise that would overpower the flavor when you bit into them. 
The bulk of the desserts were boring and way too sweet, from a lemon sorbet that tasted like artificial lemon-flavored sugar, to a cup of imitation chocolate-like substance covered in Oreos.
It was nice to have espresso drinks with dessert, though (with ""Bailey's""), and the crème brûlée wasn't bad.  Otherwise, there was nothing worth mentioning.
overall, this buffet is definitely not worth the crazy wait or the high price.  One star out of five for food and an extra for included alcohol and coffee. 
My advice: stay away from here.  You can find much better down at the strip.  Try out the Bellagio or Ceasar's Palace.
The table service was below average.  Plates weren't cleared promptly, and drinks weren't refilled quickly.  The older gentleman that was slicing meat, however, rendered the best service I had anywhere all weekend.  He was awesome: friendly, attentive and funny.  It's just too bad he was slicing up dry and flavorless meat!",1,0,0

Location
Although still connected to Las Vegas Blvd., M Resort's Studio B is actually in the city of Henderson, 10 miles away from the strip and right next to the I-15 freeway.

Ambience
When you walk in, to your right is the dessert and immediately to your left is the beer and wine server. I like to start with a little beer- it heightens my senses. Locations of other foods are easy to discover. It's brightly lit around  the food and drink area then dims down toward the tables and booths. If you go at night, there's a nice view out the window. I like how the food is arranged.. all relatively close and concentrated in a circular display (unlike Rio's world buffet where it's one straight long line).

Price
About $30 per adult for weekend-only seafood buffet. Price includes wine or beer! 

Service
Seating may take a while depending on the crowd. The line took 10 minutes for my late lunch around 3pm. For my dinner at 9pm, the line would have taken at least 30 minutes, but luckily it was my friend's 21st bday so they put us at the front of the line. Other than that, it's a buffet! Serve yourself! Waiters will come by to get your drink order, collect used plates, and get you whatever you need. Very friendly service here.

Food
I'm crazy about their snow crab legs. It comes right out of the shell and is barely salted.. perfect! You can have them hot or cold. They dedicate a huge tray just to melt over a gallon of butter for it! Oysters are raw and delicious. Coctail shrimp is... cocktail shrimp- can't go wrong. Prime rib roast- nice and juicy. Although they don't have the biggest alcohol selection, you can pair these foods with cider, wine(white zin, merlot, chardonnay) or beer(house lager, coors light). Sushi here definitely needs improvement. It does not taste fresh and I hate the rice. I haven't had everything else here, but they offer some Thai, Chinese, all American, Greek, and plenty more. If you're not a seafood eater, there's fried and grilled chicken, pork bbq ribs, and a variety of rice and pasta dishes. Dessert here is phenomenal.  They offer ice cream, gelato, creme brulee, scones, cookies, tira misu, brownies, cakes, mousse, pie, fruit tarts, crepes... Yea... Looking forward to my third trip in April!

Last Words
Disregard the 10 minute ride away from the strip. Their seafood buffet is worth it! Eat, nap if necessary, and party!",1,1,1

1. M RESORT BUFFET!
2. Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch
3. Garden Buffet at South Point Hotel

Yes, we were apparently on an off-strip dinning theme this trip. 

So what made M Resort Buffet the best? THE FOOD. obviously. lol. First thing I noticed while walking in was the bar to the left of the entrance, What?! Beer, cider, Coor's light, and lager on tap?! First time I've seen this at a buffet, I got the cider and it was awesome.

Yes they have the standard variety of buffet food, definitely all on par with the more expensive buffets in Vegas, but what pushed it to the top of my Vegas buffet list is definitely the aforementioned drinks bar and then the DESSERT! Honestly I only tried the ice cream and the tiramisu that came in a cup, but they were REALLY good. Yum...Peanut butter and cookies n cream ice cream. 

I stay away from the Chinese food at every buffet, because quite frankly, none of them are ever good enough to warrant room in my stomach when there's so much other things to eat. I go over, grab my necessary scoop of rice and I'm off on my merry way.

After 2:30 the price jumps to more than double to $39.99 because they offer seafood. Fair warning: I was traveling with a vegetarian and I also don't eat seafood. Needless to say, I was feeling a little nauseous midway through the meal when I could smell was seafood. I will say, though, the money was not well-spent on me, but if you eat seafood--I saw oysters and king crab legs--then get here before 2, as there was a line that moved extremely slow. 

Positives: The bread (seriously). They have sliced olive bread and raisins and nuts). The alcohol. Their chardonnay is pretty decent, but their cab was just okay. But because they're pretty far from the Strip, try not to be the designated driver if you want to make back your money with alcohol. Oddly, their pho soup. Super beefy stock and usually hits the spot. And choice selection. They really do have a lot to choose from. Also, wine-poached pears with cream cheese (surprising menu item) and fresh crepes. Quick plate cleanup. So quick, in fact, I wasn't even done eating my last bite when the waiter snatched the plate in front of me.

Negatives: Lukewarm food temps. If I hate one the most, it's not-hot food. You can have so-so quality, but if it's lukewarm, you're getting a bad review from me. Heck, if you have great quality and the food isn't hot, I'm writing you off. Basics, people. Their ""lattes."" While applaud the barista approach at a buffet, it's essentially a woman sticking a pod in a machine and pressing latte\/cappuccino. Yes, they have flavors like hazelnut and vanilla, but talk about watered down. Also, the ice cream and latte line are one and the same, so it gets busy. Their hot tea selection--Bigelow. I'd rather have Lipton than Bigelow.

I was here earlier in the year for a weekday dinner and drove from the Strip and it was a bit of a ghost town, especially with the super-senior crowd. This time around it was plenty busy, with people blocking other food items as they waited for the seafood. Unfortunately the food was lukewarm both times which a big no-no in my book.",1,2,0

Since then, the prices have been raised to $25 in May.  Still, it is a great value, especially for seafood buffet with Oysters, hot and cold Crab legs, Clams, always fresh fish such as salmon, halibut and sea bass.  There is always a nice array of Sashimi and poke (square cubes of raw sashimi fish mixed with soy sauce and spices which is very delicious and you don't have to waste room on eating the rice).  

A wonderful array of meats such as 2 types of prime rib, one is done well done for those who like cooked meat, and one is done rare to medium rare for carnivores like me.  At other buffets i usually have to keep checking back to see if a fresh cut of meat was put out.  They also serve a wonderfully cooked glazed duck breast.  

Desserts are magnificent.  Yes, the chocolate fountains are just for decoration, but if you are lucky and strawberries are in season, you might just snag a couple chocolate or white chocolate covered strawberries.  These are huge, the size where you go to the Bellagio pastry shop and spend $3 for one strawberry.  Other deserts are chocolate souffle, creme brulee, flan, macaroons, meringue cookies, crepes, gelato, coffee\/espresso,  and a wide variety of Sugar free desserts for the diabetics.  Please ask, as they is more assortment behind the displays.  

I almost forgot to mention the all you can drink alcohol.  it includes a large assortment of wine, cider, coors light, some german dark ale beer, and Thomas Knepper root beer for the kiddies and non drinkers which gets served in a cool little mug shaped like a barrel.  Get an empty mug, get some vanilla gelato, and then get your root beer to make a delicious root beer float.

Although it's off the beaten strip, at approximately 10 miles away, this place is totally worth the drive, or worth the stop before going into vegas.

Also, unlimited beer and wine for you to choose from. But hey, who really cares about that when all beer and wine will do is fill you up. Nope, i'm here for their delicious high quality crab legs and oysters. 

You better make room for the dessert and espresso bar because there are so many awesome choices to choose from. Now these dessert aren't your regular desserts you normally see at the other vegas hotels. Studio B needs to set itself apart from the strip to draw your attention and money.

Cons: Food is just ""meh""

I had such high hopes for this place, but once again, IMHO Studio B is just another place to add to the rest of the mediocre Las Vegas buffets.

Don't get me wrong, I love all you can eat places.  I also realize buffets, in general, will not be as good as your run of the mill regular service restaurant.  But considering how much hype there is for this place, I just expected so much more.

I got various dishes from the different types of cuisines (Asian, Mexican, etc) and they were good, just not great.  What was great was the fact that alcoholic beverages (beer and wine) were included in our meal price.  I didn't drink too much, but if I were in the mood, I could see how eating here could be fun.

The price here was pretty reasonable too ($15.99 for lunch).

I thought we'd be in the clear with it being Monday and all...but we were met with about an hour + 40 minute wait! My boyfriend was becoming enflamed as we waited and waited. He said if he would have been given a little heads-up (I guess I forgot to mention that litlle tidbit of info to him), his nerves would have been way less taut and frazzled. So I'm giving you a heads-up...expect around a 1 hr + wait.

A friend told me about this buffet, a friend that is a restaurant owner, so I figured it would probably be something pretty special. We came during lunch, which is served from 10:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. and is priced at $15.99. Breakfast is served from 7:00 - 10:30 a.m. and is $10.99. Dinner starts at 4:00 p.m. and runs till 10:00 p.m. and is priced at $23.99. The Grand Seafood Buffet is only served on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for $33.99. Children 4 & Under eat free! With these prices, no wonder people were surging in!  We missed out on the Seafood Buffet but there is so much food during the lunch and dinner periods, that you will be more than happy. 

They have salmon and albacore nigiri, futomaki sushi rolls, crawfish, grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, pear & walnut salad, gourmet salads, pastas, antipastos, mussels, prime rib, roasted chicken, roast beef, applewood bacon, turkey, chicken a la king, paella, hummus, pita bread, enchiladas, nachos, ham 'n cheese mac, oxtail soup, ponsit, lumpia, egg rolls, chicken masala, saag paneer, pizza, calzones, lasagna, lattes, cappuchinos, expressos, hot chocolate, creme brulee, tiramisu, fruit tarts, cannolis,  gelato, French macaroons, cookies, chocolate souflee, amaretto cups, brownies, chocolate-covered strawberries, crepes, fruit, pudding, bottomless wine & beer and so so much more. 

And these were only the items coming off my recollection and from the lunch menu!

Everything, save for the nigiri, was very tasty. The nigiri was not bad - it just didn't have that freshly made flavor (which is totally understandable considering the mass volume of output at play here). The rice was crunchy from refrigeration. The paella was my favorite - seasoned shrimp, clams and rice in a savory broth. The goat cheese and walnut salad and the ham 'n cheese mac were excellent. My boyfriend liked the oxtail soup and the prime rib. The chocolate souffle and the oreo cookie gelato were quite delicious. And the cappuchinos made by their Studio B barista were strong, hot and frothy. 

Studio B Buffet is a great dining option if you can contend with the long wait.  I'm mean, people were rolling in 12-people deep!! I'm still on the fence about the 2 hour wait. It is a beautiful, impressive spread of food though, with lots of wonderful food, so I'll probably be back (I gotta try the Seafood Buffet).",3,0,1

If you have a ride and some time, I would recommend the short drive. On weekends they offer some seafood options in their buffet. Apparently on this particular weekend that we went, there was a special deal for lunch time: $16 per person (regular price is about $30ish). Score!

Don't be fooled by thinking that just because the M Resort is located away from all the strip action that people aren't going to flock to this buffet. I highly advise you to come early or at least be ready to wait. Don't say you weren't warned. We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about a full hour before we got seated. By then, we were all starving and ready to eat everything in sight. 

I kid you not, there's tons of food here. As I stared at all the selecitons, I couldn't stop thinking about Mike Rowe and that one episode on Dirty Jobs where all the Vegas buffet leftovers are trucked out to the pig farm. 

The food is fresh, clean, and your options is practically endless. There's everything from some sushi, to random Asian selections, to Mediterranean, as well as steam crab legs and boiled shrimp. They of course have prime rib as well as tri tip and ribs available. There's just too much to list. Not everything is a winner but overall you should find a good number of dishes that will entice your taste buds.

Leave room for some dessert. There is an awesome gelato bar accompanied with many other sweet tooth selections.

For you big drinkers, there's a hidden open bar with unlimited wine and beer. It is located directly to your left as you enter the buffet. Don't miss out on it if you love to booze. They purposely keep it concealed for a reason.

We all literally rolled out of Studio B quite impressed, retardedly full, and ready to blow some gaskets. M Resort did have their last laugh though because as I was trying to digest all that grub in their casino, their tables robbed me for $250. In conclusion, that meal felt like it costed me $266.

For dinner it is slightly more than half the cost of the other two I mentioned and the food, while not at the same level, is very close. The most notable difference is that this is a more ""traditional"" buffet setup rather than the painstakingly individual plates of the higher end buffets. Quality wise, I have enjoyed everything I have had there. And yes they still have the typical meat carving stations (prime rib, pork, sausage, fish.)

We wandered through the casino and were promptly seated after we paid for our meal. The overall decor was sort of cafeteria like but very modern with lots of dark woods and metals.

Crab legs were served hot and cold. They even had raw oysters on the bar. Everything we had was served at the right temperature and was fresh. They continually replenished all the items and we had mimosas and champagne included in the price of $26.

everything they offer!

this is probably the best buffet i have ever been to. for the price i paid, around 23 bucks, i would not have expected the food quality--but keep in mind these are buffet standards. so if you are looking for an all out 4 or 5 star food rating, you're out of luck. but if you are looking for a myriad of average to a little more than above average food and a great selection of such food, this is a must. from american to asian to latin, they have it all. and if you are wondering if this is better than the oh so famous (for whatever reason) bellagio buffet, it is!! the bellagio has a better selection of seafood items however but nothing was a must have. and i believe studio b has a seafood buffet on the weekends. 

some standouts for me were the chow mein which had great texture and taste. i never find good chow mein at buffets, never. the salmon sushi was surprisingly good though as you expect the temperature of the fish (due to its sitting out) was pretty warm for sushi. bottomless wine and i think beer too.

So when we finally made it to the table it was like the gates opened to the promise land!!
I was so HAPPY!!!! And the truth is, the food was great! And ALMOST worth the wait! Ok, it was worth it, but I should have brought a granola bar or something! LOL

Every table I walked by had a mountain of crab leg shells! They must go through tons of them!!
And I can see why, they were yummy....and...wait for it......Sliced in 1\/2 so they are super easy to eat! YAAAAASSS!!!  So good, chilled or warm with drawn butter you decide. The shrimp are the same, shelled, chilled and a big mound of crushed ice. And all of it goes so fast, it was all fresh and tasty.

There were so many other fantastic things, we had a blast, once the HANGRY was not part of the equation. I would go back for sure!!!! I had 4 plates of food, which I never eat that much! A testament to the yummy factor!

The sushi was hard, cold, awful anyways.  The only reason this review didn't get 1 star is because of the wine\/beer\/ champagne and lattes came with the price.  This used to be my favorite buffet (especially because of the price and the fried chicken - which they didn't have for the holiday buffet).   I hope Studio B and M Resort management is reading this.  I don't understand how this can go from my favorite buffet to the worst buffet so quickly.",0,0,0

From what I tasted, all the food was fresh.  The only thing is that the King Crab Legs are not cracked open for you so I know how it may be frustrating if you are in grub mode.  But hey, there's no such thing as a free lunch!  The shrimp here is big and juicy.  The desserts are good.  The meat options aren't bad at all.  

I definitely find this buffet comparable to Wynn and a bit cheaper.  The only thing is the hotel is off the strip and I hear the line can get crazy with hours.  I hate lines..I don't do them..even lines of coke...I just hate lines.  I went at 3pm and it was still packed..but no lines =D  Also they do have some sort of show they are quite secretive about.  Some chick from Food Network...

Luckily, my grouchiness was eased by the exotic and perfectly prepared food awaiting my ravenous appetite within.

Dear God.  Really.  The tri-tip with horseradish was made to a brilliant consistency, and the seafood bar was undoubtedly fresh, leaving a clean taste on the palate.  Best part was the ox tail stew, and the poki!  My appetite or Asian cuisine has been revitalized, thanks to this place.

It was $30 per person for dinner and wine\/beer.  Pssh, chump change, my dear-- well, for what you get anyway.

It's been a while since we were at Studio B for a meal since we don't exactly leave near by the Hendo area.  It was a bit of a drive for us, but on a rare weekday off the wifey and I decided let's make the trek!  Was pretty worth it!

Surprisingly, lunch at Studio B was busy!  This is probably because the buffet is only open for lunch & dinner, with the only breakfast option being on Sundays.  Make sure you get the M Resort player's card folks!  Minimal play gets you that nice BOGO coupon for Studio B - hefty savings!  We used it to our advantage!  Lunch for the wifey & I was only $16.99 plus tax...for the BOTH of us!  And it includes all-you-can-drink BEER & WINE too!!  Whutttttt!!  Drown your lost wages in food & alcohol!

Food I gotta say is actually of above decent quality, for being a buffet!  Sure beats out a lot of other buffets in town for the money.  I had a little bit of everything:

-Sushi
-Prime Rib
-Stuffed Grape Leaves
-Hummus
-Oxtail!  (one of my faves)
-Breakfast Smoothie
-Kalbi Short Ribs
-Poke!

The kalbi short ribs and ahi poke were probably on constant rotation for me, tasty!  And I got to wash it all down with multiple glasses of Shock Top!  Oh man, livin' large for lunch!

The Studio B dessert section is actually still very varied even for lunch, and the gelatos are of good quality too.  Even end your meal with a handmade cappuccino or latte!  I really can't complain.

Still all great here at the Studio B buffet, we'll be back!  Especially with some comps and coupons!

The spaghetti must have been left out awhile because the noodles were becoming a little hard.

The steak was pretty bad. It was way too salty. There's still a lot of varieties of food offered at Studio B, but they don't look nearly as inviting as they once were. I still love it because it's affordable, and with the price I paid for, I can't really complain.

The couple of times I went, there was cold food, poor service trying to get cuts of meat, and the woman pouring wine expects a tip for... doing her job.

The desserts there are a complete failure, unfortunately. Dessert is my favorite part of a buffet, and this place fails on so many levels. From unsuccessful chocolate souffle to watery creme brulee, to tiramisu with WAY too much alcohol in it. I left thoroughly unimpressed on both occasions.

The other thing that pissed me off is the demand of 1 player card per discount. Every other casino I've eaten at allows you to purchase up to 4 meals discounted on one card. Not the M. They expect you to stand in their long line with their slow staff for 45 minutes waiting for a player's card, and everyone else in your buffet group to do the same or not receive the discount.

For $30+\/per person for either BLD, I think it's worth it! Vegas is all about their buffets and extravagance - Studio B is probably the epitome of both! I heard lines can form and people wait for hours just dying to eat here on the weekends. BUT!!!!! If you just come a little bit earlier (which is why the early bird gets the worm), you'd be able to not wait as long and just chow down as you intended to.

I came here for my grandmother's 75th birthday. My fam bam took her out to brunch. Service was awesome and the food was grastronomical! 

Food that they cater to: Mediterranean\/Lebanese, Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino, American, Southern, Mongolian, Italian, Chinese, Seafood (FRESHLY STEAMED KING CRAB LEGS & OYSTERS!!!), Mexican, Indian and the desserts!

Memorable foods I'd love to eat HERE again:
- Hawaiian Poke 
- Hawaiian Lau lau
- Caprese Salad
- Ribs
- Sweet Potatoes
- King crab legs
- Oysters

[SODIUM WARNING] I took off one star due to the HIGH salty taste of their LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP. It sounds amazing, but just tasting the darn thing reeked sodium overload! I couldn't finish the bowl I had poured for myself and hated that such great food went to waste [**insert sad face here**]

DESSERTS: I enjoyed all of their mini dessert shooters! Pistachio, Tiramisu, Cookies N' Creme are just to name a few...... Not to mention their gelato, yummy cakes, cookies and other decadent delightfuls! Desserts weren't over-powering sweet! Just right to end your meal extravaganza at Studio B!

Overall thought?
I will definitely come back to Studio B when I'm back in the neighborhood! Great service, great food (minus the lobster bisque) and come hungry (and early) to get your moolah's worth!

To be fair, it wasn't an unbearable wait since I helped myself to the complimentary soft drinks on the casino floor and brought some back for my family also.

Now onto the food, the most noticable feature of this buffet is the free beer and wine, which is nothing short of awesome. Now granted, the beer was cheap PBR and coors light but I'm not complaining. The food, however, I found to be quite lacking. The first prime rib slice I got was way too rare and hardly looked like it was cooked at all. The second slice I got was good and made up for it, however. The salads looked unremarkable and the pizza looked worse than the stuff you get in a school cafeteria, so needless to say I tried neither.

This buffet is one of the best tasting and organized. This buffet is shaped in a snake formation going from one end to another it starts off with your simple salad and the more you go in the more variety of food you will run into.

This buffet is very family friendly but yet looks quite professional at the same time. The waiters and waitresses are indeed very kind and friendly as well as some of the chefs themselves. 

I stayed at Las Vegas for 3 days and all 3 days I was there I ate at a buffet and I would say that Studio B and the M was definitely the best tasting.

Though they do not have many sushi options but only a few. The taste of the sushi really stands out from other buffets, which makes up for the amount of sushi.

While you are here I suggest everyone to visit the dessert section which is separated from the rest of the buffet.
The desserts there are the best you will taste! Most buffets here at Las Vegas, Nevada has a decent amount of desserts but Studio B has more desserts then the rest plus the taste is wonderful! A must try!

Every single time a Vegas trip happens, this buffet is a MUST for my friends and I.  We almost barely didn't make it either... with our good pal Patrick H. feeling uneasy from the night before, but we were absolutely determined to make the lunch buffet special before driving back to LA.

Hands down my favorite buffet in Vegas, for many reasons.  Bear with me as I try to list all the reasons why my heart belongs to Studio B Buffet, and try not to growl in hunger too much as I am about to writing this.

For one, The M is a wonderful casino.  Its got a beautiful atmosphere, a nice pool to lay in, and a divine wine cellar for those enthusiasts.  Because it is not on the strip, you will find it less crowded and can be rewarding to those seeking a more relaxing holiday.

Now, back to the buffet.  This buffet is SUPERB!  They have many specials throughout the year, such as a summer brunch special with mimosas included!  Definitely come here for lunch, as you pay upon arrival into the buffet.  With no time limit, it is very doable to stay for dinner when more seafood and meat options come out.  Even then, lunch is absolutely worth it, for only around $20 you can get so much amazing food.

The restaurant is laid out in a variety of stations.  On the far left, you got the International cuisine section, with lots of Chinese, Japanese, and even Filipino options to enjoy.  There is a sashimi salad that has plenty of salmon and tuna, as well as nigiri and basic rolls.  Following that, you have whole-hearted foods such as mashed potato, greens, and plenty of chicken.  It's like a Thanksgiving feast everyday here.

The BBQ ribs here are delicious, and the tri-tip that is personally cut for you is oozing with flavor.  You can also request for them to cut it on the side which the meat is done to your liking.  After that, you have the salad and sandwich bar, and then comes the SEAFOOD.  Tons of clams, mussels, fresh shrimp and king crab legs!  Take advantage of this part especially, as everything in the seafood section is delicious.  Ow... I think my stomach just growled.

Studio B also has complimentary drinks, including BOOZE!  The cider is a definite must!  Just be sure to tip at least a $1 for the friendly bartender when you get a drink.  For those youngins, make sure to bring your ID because your sexy selves will be carded.  For those nondrinkers, soft drinks and plenty of water are available through your server.

To finish your meal, go grab a dessert or two.  Cookies, cakes, and gelato ice cream are laid out for you to take.  You can even take one dessert out with you after you finish your meal.

The service here is GREAT.  Our server was SO nice to us, especially to our hungover friend.  She was suggesting specific things to eat to quell the hangover, as well as constantly refilling our waters and drinks to make sure he stay hydrated.  Thank you so much!

1. get there early cause there's a line
2. get there early i'm serious or you won't make it in 
3. buffet includes drinks... i.e. beer and wine too
4. know some games you can play while you're in line might be there a while
5. they close like at 10 PM i think, and 9 PM is when they stop cooking that's what I hear...

More other pros about this buffet is there are FREE beer and house wine (both white and red)! You cant beat that anywhere else! Service is usually pretty good. Always refilling drinks at the right time never really had to wait for the waiter\/waitress to bring something you requested.

The food was not bad overall -- especially the meat selections, and it's true that free all-you-can-drink wine or beer is included.  

While I don't go to buffets for the veggies ... it's nice to have a little something to polish off the main meal.  And the vegetable selection was weak -- there was basically nothing outside the salad greens that wasn't swimming in some kind of sauce.

The dessert selection was actually kind of underwhelming compared to other Vegas buffets.  The macaroons were quite good, but... most everything else was very generic and in micro portions.

This might have been 3 stars (average), except that dinner was $25 a head after tax PLUS there was a 75 minute wait standing in line to get in.

So we stood in line for about 1 hour 30 min when it was estimated a 2 hour wait which is good.

Some places like the Wynn buffet will split in 1\/2 for you, really killing some of the taste. 
Beer and Wine being served make it awesome, but you should try the root beer that they have on tap too.

My first thought was that the entry process is well organized. Unlike other buffets, which will keep on ringing people up despite the line to be seated being so long that there's nowhere for the newly paid customers to stand, the process was orderly and quick. 

The food is delicious. I found the quality to be on par with the Bellagio buffet. And the variety of food was excellent. There was a ton to try. Among my favorites: General Tso's chicken, spicy salmon rolls, the tiny bratwursts, shredded pork and the pesto salmon. For the first time ever, I went back to the dessert area for seconds. There were a million little cookies, meringues, tarts, slices of cake, plus crepes and gelato. The crepes aren't made to order, but they were tasty (I had two). The gelato was great. 

I do have a couple of complaints. The first regards the layout of the buffet. It takes the shape of a very bulbous bell curve, with the ""top"" of the curve poking out into the middle of the room. It's kind of awkward to walk around and it tends to be a long walk back to your table if you're on the opposite side of the curve. There should be a path ""underneath"" the curve to cut out a lot of unnecessary walking (I love exercise as much as the next person, but this is a buffet....the less time you have to spend juggling plates and trying not to run into people, the better). My second issue is that none of the ""cuisine areas"" are labeled. It would have been helpful to see quickly where the Asian food or the carving station or the salads were, rather than having to walk the whole buffet line to figure it out.

All in all, it was worth the $24 per person, but due to the layout, I don't know that I'd go back anytime soon.",1,0,1

Orange Chicken- nice tangy and sweet and sour taste.  I'm glad there was hardly any breading around the chicken.

Mahi Mahi- it was cooked over bamboo wood.  It has a lemon taste to it.

Mac and Cheese- too creamy for my taste

Their wine option was pretty good, but they didn't have any options on tap because it was broken at that time.  

Ambiance and service was nice, but nothing too special.

It's equally difficult to begin by commenting on anything other than the filth in this once-glistening food extravaganza. Every ""clean"" table is gross, covered in food scraps...as are the chairs...that's right, the chairs you will be sitting on. I used a handful of salt to scrub off my silverwear before use. Forget whatever marketing imagery you have seen in magazines or the in-room infomercial, this dining area looks more like ""rugby locker room, catered yesterday, sans garbage cans.""

We've been coming here for special events for a decade; my employer even used the lunch buffet for team-building excursions from work. Well those days have simply gone by the wayside based on this most recent visit on Saturday, Feb 13, 2016. Our plan was to beat the Valentine's crowd by dining a day early....nice try but despite the $40 per person tag, the buffet was once again filled to capacity.

Yes, there is variety, if you consider a single platter of spicy tuna rolls and a prime rib log as variety. The biggest issue with Studio B is the obvious drop in quality (both the food and its preparation.)  The chicken satay, roast turkey, and kalbi beef ribs were mostly inedible being overcooked to a dry, hard chew. The fruit and bread products appear and taste old and dried out. The salad and soups are indeed up to snuff, but that hardly makes for a 5-star buffet. Lastly, the desserts have seen little change, offer the most value, and in general are the high-point of the Studio B buffet. Imagine what a $100 Valentine's meal should be, then reverse it to imagine the Studio B buffet....Tony, it's time for a complete tear down and rebuild of this restaurant.

All things considered, a Station's Casino buffet offers better quality, taste, and convenience at 1\/3 the cost....both locals and out-of-town diners should not believe the M casino hype and choose to eat elsewhere with their dollars and comps.",3,3,2

Arrived at around 6pm. Didn't get seated until 9:45...yeah...it was THAT packed...

Overall the buffet is well balanced between things that work and things that didnt. I cant throw my arms up in the air and just cry out that every was delicious and how i wish to go back every chance i could but realistically i can't. Instead i'm just going to list things i've had and comment on them in my usual review fashion. (Hint Click the 'Useful' button)

- Hard Cider -
Wanted the Root Beer but they were all out, darn kids... so went for the hard cider. Was carded upon request but stopped taking offense after i noticed the woman working the drinks was carding everyone. Wow this stuff is good, very light in taste, doesn't have an aftertaste or linger, very refreshing.

- Ginger Snow\/King (yeah i don't know which) Crabs - 
Everyone was assaulting the cold\/warm legs and i didnt feel like waiting to pick off what ever's left. My buddy found these in the Chinese section. They were pure WIN. Perfectly seasoned, still warm, juicy and fresh tasting.

- Prime Rib -
When i got to the prime rib station the hunk of meat was nearing the end and the handler was struggling to get cuts of the meat correctly. i requested the hunk of dark meat with the fat. He was glad to get rid of that part for it was much larger then the rest due to his 'excellent' slicing skills. Wow...the end piece was perfectly seasoned and almost melted in my mouth. Totally made that 3.5hr wait worth it.

- Chicken Florentine -
Dry, tasteless, dry...more dry...more tasteless...epic fail

- Steak Grilled something something... - 
Wow just WOW these were good. Forgot what it was called because it had an unusual name but looked like grilled steak covered in gravy. The steaks were well done but wasnt tough or stringy. They had a VERY nice grilled taste and the gravy wasnt overpowering at all.

- Bamboo Mahi Mahi - 
Had an unusual flavor, i can only describe it as 'woody with a citrus background' but the flesh was just so dry

- Shrimp Cocktail - 
Hit and miss. Some shrimp had firm tails, some hard, some nearly dissolved. Cocktail sauce was heavy on the horseradish.

- Here i go again - 
is anyone even reading any of this?

- Red Seafood Curry - 
Wish they offered Indian curries. Anyway the curry had more of a seafood flavor then a curry flavor. Spicy but with no flavor so it was just a spicy seafood taste.

- Chicken Teriyaki - 
Tasted like steamed chicken with sauce poured all over it. Would have claimed this to be fail but the chicken went along great with the beef red curry sauce.

- Hummus -
The first time i went to this buffet i remembered the hummus to be the most disgusting dip i've ever seen but ended up the best hummus i've ever had. This trip was the complete opposite. The hummus looked average and tasted...blah. Tasted like gritty cream with no flavor.

- Pizza Bread - 
Dont know why i got this but so glad i'm did. Pretty much topping and sauce-less pizza dough in pizza slices with cheese on top. Tasted awesome.

- Roasted Lamb -
Overcooked and tasteless. Tough and a bit stringy. Salt couldnt fix the lack of flavor.

- Mushroom Salad - 
oooh these little marinated mushrooms were bomb 

- Pistachio Shooters - 
Whoa these were good, Pistachio pudding with raspberry puree at the bottom. Very nice

- Tiramisu Shooters - 
Eh not quite the epic tiramisu i've had at CPK (of all places to have tiramisu...) but they were...alright

- Oreo Cookie Shooters - 
Eh...Why? with the Pistachio and the Tiramisu why even have this? It's like putting a musket behind a machine gun. obviously one is vastly superior then the other.

Last bit was the experience. I know it's thanksgiving and i know the entire buffet shuts down and starts booting people by 10:30. But COME ON. It's Thanksgiving and we've waited in line for 3 and a half hours. I know the staff wanna go home to their families but COME ON I WAS IN LINE FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS!!",4,0,2

here's the lowdown:
-king crab legs [both warm and cold] were a tad bit too salty. the forked plastic tool used to assist in yanking out the meat did not help but at least the crabs were pre-cracked [standard these days, anyhow]. just give me a pair of chopsticks, and i can do wonders.

-oysters. no mignonette sauce. aahhhhhhhh! these were definitely not the best, but at least they were somewhat still fresh. since i love ""me"" some oysters, the majority of my plate[s] consisted of these clam shells - with lots and lots of lemon juice. 

-prime rib was somewhat decent. i'm not a big fan of prime rib anyhow, but i'd agree with Pauline C. that it's above buffet quality standards.

-the rest of the fillers were typical. after a few samples, i didn't even bother with the rest. sometimes you can tell how good or bad something is simply by looking at it [or smelling it in my case].

the dessert - probably the only reason why the ratings are so high i'm not a dessert person, but i somehow ended up partaking in a few delicacies. i caved for the presentation alone and indulged in what looked like a chocolate and vanilla mousse cup and gelato. yum!

my conclusion - it's overrated. skip the buffet, and go for something nicer altogether for the same price. your stomach may not be as full but your body will thank you later for it.",5,4,4

In January I became a vegan and last week we decided to go to Studio B.

Not quite sure on what I can eat , so I called and asked to talk to the Food and Beverage Director or manager .

I left a message and as of now havnt heard back.

I did talk to a manager who said i could juat ask one of the chefs to make me something if they had it on the line.

Let you tell me I tried . Everyone was so busy, I couldnt get anyones attention.

The only thing I ate was asaparigus and rice ,  Misa Soup and Sorbet.

I also thought their crab legs were better than other buffets. They were more meaty and not soggy. The food was definitely top quality, but dessert was by far the most exciting for me! The day before I had dinner at Wicked Spoon, and out of all the dessert choices I took, I only took one bite of everything and had seven scoops of gelato. At Studio B Buffet, EVERYTHING tasted delicious! I don't normally like apple pie, let alone finish a whole slice, but I took a bite from my boyfriend's plate and immediately gobbled it up completely. Their flan and crepes were also legit. From fruit tarts to eclairs to custard puffs, everything was delicious! I haven't even gotten to the gelato yet! I like that they have cones rather than the waffle cups served at Wicked Spoon. It's a lot easier to take out after you've stuffed yourself silly. I really think they have the best strawberry gelato.

There were so many choices to choose from! From Sushi, prime rib, soups, salads, cheese plates, pizza + pasta, steamed fishes, chicken, etc. Anything you can name, they probably have it, or something similiar to it. 

I went on Christmas, and since it was holidy, they had a seafood buffet. Crabs, oysters, mussels, clams, shrimp cocktails, etc. I also loved that they had a cheese plate. Everything tasted pretty good, for it being a buffet. The seafood was about as fresh as other seafood buffets on the Vegas Strip that I've been to. 

Another BIG difference than the Strip buffets...is that they have unlimited drinks and specialty coffee. Yes, you can order champagne, beer, alcohol, lattes, espressos, etc. And it is also INCLUDED in the price of the buffet. They dont charge extra like other buffets off the strip do. 

The Dessert section is also something to rave about. Not only is their food good here, but their desserts! They even have gelato =O Theres a variety of pastries, bakeries, cakes, chocolate, parfaits, etc. The desserts are from Baby Cakes, which i think is definately worth it...since Baby Cakes is pretty darn expensive. I ate so much desserts, i think just the desserts alone that I ate, could cover the cost of my buffet. haha.

There were a lot of good reviews for Studio B, so I decided to give it a try because it beat waiting in line at Bacchanal for 2 hours. The crab legs, the meat was actually chewy and over cooked and lacked any flavor. I tried a duck drumstick with cherry confit. I could not cut through the meat with a knife, it was that tough. Overall the selection didn't look very presentable and taste was horrendous. I would compare the quality of food on par with a hospital cafeteria. 

I have no idea why the reviews for this buffet were so high. I wanted to cry after leaving, spending $40 per person on mediocre food. Service was a bit slow. Took about 15 minutes to get drinks for the table and stacks of dirty dishes were piling up on the table.

The prices are bumped up to $40 per adults and roughly around $25-30 for kids under 9 years old if I remember correctly. As I was discussing the prices with my party, a customer comes in and reassures us that the $40 dollar price point was well worth every single penny. 

We decided to give the place a try and, oh man, there were PLENTY of delicious food! There were a variety of foods from Asian food, Italian food, American food, and they even had a pho station where you can make your own pho! They also have mimosa on the bar included with the experience so that was a definite plus.

Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal very much.  The only 'knock' I have is that one of my oysters had a very 'funny' aftertaste and I worried about it being bad, (it wasn't).

The food and drink menu was very good, but I would have preferred to have a Bloody Mary option instead of just champagne, wine and beer.

The $39.99 price is a bit steep for me for brunch, but comparable to other Sunday brunch buffets, it is quite reasonable.

I would easily recommend Studio B when asked about Sunday brunch choices.",1,0,0

At first look, this place sounds amazing! Raw oysters, prime rib, unlimited mimosas\/beer, crab, and a huge amount of other items.

We came in for lunch in December and were hoping to do the cheaper $15 buffet but during the holidays the prices are consistently $40. I didn't mind though and was looking forward to it after hearing about their amazing selection. While the seafood quality wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't good either. The only items that were halfway decent that I tried were the pastas (if you like REALLY creamy pastas), the shrimp (nothing special about it, just...shrimp+cocktail sauce), the prime rib (not bad for a buffet), some of the cream based desserts (some were hit and miss but some were pretty good), and their gelato (not amazing but not bad either). 

Everything else just tasted of disappointment. The crab (both hot and cold) was REALLY overcooked. The oysters were extremely bland and I could barely get them out of their shells. The sashimi\/sushi fish was also bland but not the worst. The rice on the other hand was hard and inedible. The poke and lomi lomi salmon was overly salty with little other flavor. 

Overall, I left full but unsatisfied with the quality. Service was nice but due to the number of people, we weren't checked on too much. Glad to have tried it at least once though. 2 stars for regular quality but 3 considering its a buffet\/the price.",2,0,2

But 6 hours after eating here, my poor boyfriend got the worse of the symptoms...100.5 fever, abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea of all sorts you name it. I for once have a stomach that isn't as sensitive as his but am still suffering from cramps and bad gas.

We tried to pinpoint what we both ate that got us sick, it is either the stir fry vegetables, the kalbi ribs or the chow mein . Ekkk I'm feeling sick just thinking of it.

Sadly, when I went back for more salad, it was empty.  I waited for a few minutes but nothing was brought out.  I enjoyed the watermelon on my first round, but when they brought more out, it wasn't as sweet.  I'm usually not a dessert person, but I did enjoy the chocolate souffle, flan, creme brulee and pudding.  My 8 yr old enjoyed his gelato, although paying $22.99 for 2 slices of pizza, 4 slices of watermelon, some salad, 2 fortune cookies and gelato is definitely a rip-off.

Loved the various food selection at the buffet, especially the delicious crab legs and oysters. For some reason, I concentrated on the crab legs and ate about 50 plates of it! Not to mention more than a few plates of oysters. I also appreciated that they had hot and cold crab legs to choose from. The shrimp was a little dainty, but was still tasty.

I did try the prime rib and kalbi which was all delicious and other things that I can't recall but do know that I enjoyed it all! I do remember having a slight remorse after paying $30 per person, but after eating, it was well worth it!

Wary of how buffet quality has declined tremendously across the vegas strip in the past decade, was optimistic for this joint. 
Treated family of 4. The wait was 1 hour, yes ONE FUCKING hour, on a Tuesday afternoon, with people who have nothing better to do than come here in the middle of nowhere to wait in line to eat at a buffet. (yes that includes me)
And right when I get to pay, they insist ALL members be present even though there is a separate line after you pay. I told the cashier lady they will be here just take my fucking money but no dice. I didn't want to make my 70 and 93-year old in laws stand in midst the scum of the earth waiting in line, lost a few places in line by the time I flagged their asses down to join the herd. Stupid fucking rule.
Price is cheap; its $18.00 a person for lunch, mid-week.
The selection is plenty, its a middle of the pack buffet, Ive eaten a lot better and worse. If you want to fill up your belly, for a cheap price its OK.
Highlights:
Fried chicken
Salmon sashimi salad (probably farm raised in Bangladesh sewers but whatever) tasted good.
Good salads variety, greek, caesar, and more.
Tri tip sliced, not bad, tastes like prime rib.
Soup varieties (like the asparagus cream)
Chinese station and spring rolls (provided its hot, wait for the hot tray.)
Sliced breads =yummy and crispy edged sourdough
Our server was very friendly and took plates quick. Wish I got her name.
Nacho chips and cheese sauce\/salsa bar not bad. Wish they had taco meat and burritos\/shells.
Pizzas=must say, one of the tastier pizzas I have had at a vegas buffet, was delish, and best item to eat. Its tucked away all the way in the back going around the center. Ample cheese, good crust, delish tomato sauce. dont expect King Arthur's supreme in terms of toppings, but tastes great.


Lowlights:
Gelato section=and fruits, a serious joke. Skip all the way.
Pork ribs=stay away
No crab legs for lunch boooooooo.
sushi very crappy cut rolls. whoever invented cream cheese in a sushi roll should be hung and shot.
Cheese enchiladas=was lukewarm yuk.
As usual some scary-ass looking items, you can easily tell\/skip

In a nutshell, worth trying if you can withstand the long lines. For me it was a challenge with a bad back waiting 1 hour standing. If they had crab legs for lunch (shit add a few bucks I dont care) then it would be 4 stars.

Of course, I immediately go for the seafood but was disappointed because the crab legs were not fresh and the oyster and clams still had sand in them = not cleaned at all. 

However, I would really recommend the hot foods. My favorite was the ox tail and prime rib. They were so flavorful, tender and just falls off the bone. I felt like they did that really well. The vegetables like the broccoli with ponzu sauce was well cooked and not overly soggy.

The decor is pleasing and open enough that one will probably not notice anything but the food. There are large screens mounted above the buffet line showing various things like Food Network. There is a bit of a wait sometimes, but that is fairly normal for a buffet in vegas. The selection is quite large. Instead of usual buffet line lining the outside of the room. Studio B takes more of a wavy, bell curve approach with the dessert section off to the other side of the entrance. A plus to note, they do offer free beer and wine included with the buffet price. Since I don't drink I don't take advantage of that portion of the buffet nor can I vouch for that part. For drinkers I'd think that adds a bit of extra value to the experience.(Long as you're not the one having to drive after!)
There was one odd experience. One item offered once was ginger stir-fried crab legs. They were grabbed up quickly each time it was refilled. The odd part was it seemed the cook was instructed only to refill the fairly small tray only every so often. We were there at least 30min, maybe 1hr at most. It was only filled twice.

I'll tell you why:  I can eat my worth & wait (you read that correctly, not weight; and it's like $33 and a 40 minute wait for brunch or dinner) there.  Why?  So many reasons, but the main one is the snow crab legs.  You can get 'em on ice or steamed, and I go for the latter.  I've never waited in line for them and they never run out which is amazing since God knows people like me are stuffing ourselves like gluttons with them.  

Let me attempt to describe the dessert bar.  I didn't actually measure the length of this section of delectable, heaven-on-earth, but I'd estimate it's at least 30 yards in length and it caters to sugar-free dessert eaters as well as the rest of us more irresponsible feeders.  They offer every conceivable kind of pie (I didn't check for rhubbard) and cake you can fathom, plus danishes, cream puffs of multiple flavors, creme brule, cakes so beautiful you *almost* feel guilty to dismantle and eat, truffles and at least 10 flavors of gellato.  Maybe you're more of a after-dinner drinks kind of person.  That's fine, too.  They have a full alcohol bar plus an espresso machine so if you'd like a Bailey's Irish Cream hot coffee, just say so (and show your ID).  

What's your palette prefer?--Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Italian, American, others?  Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.  I'm a dangerous kind of buffet diner in that my eyes are often bigger than my stomach and so I have to really try not to waste food.  If you suffer from this same kind of temptation, try to pace yourself and do small portions each trip.  There's so much and it's so beautifully, invitingly laid out that you'll want to try it all.   

The environment is busy, but I never feel rushed to get out.  I mean, for crying out loud, I stood in line almost an hour to get seated so I'm going to take my time.  It's not like they're going to run out of food and if they run out of something, you're probably not going to notice since there's so many choices (unless it's the crab legs, and I've yet to experience that).  There's a loudness to the place, but it's not overwhelming, and that's probably partially because of the wide openness of the eating area.  It's well lit, not too crowded for such a popular establishment, and has a chic decor, but the thing you will never forget is the food--options, presentation, and taste.  It's been about a year since I last ate there and I can't forget the food, but the decor is blurry in my recollection.

Dessert, I had pumpkin pie, chocolate chip cookie, and cookie and cream gelato. Totally worth getting too. I wasn't able to try some other stuff since I was full. Darn it.

Maybe next time I'll not eat anything at all until dinner time so I could try a little bit more of everything.

Everything else: Service was good, no other comments on it. Dining area is very clean. Love the atmosphere.

Overall, although I like the buffet inside The Bellagio better than any other buffets I've been to in Las Vegas, Studio B Buffet is still an solid good place for an great cost. Make sure to stop by here on your way home.",29,25,29

The crab legs are a big attraction, and for me, the dessert bar was top notch. But the rest of the food? Meh.

This is all coming from someone who wouldn't appreciate the open bar though (all you can drink wine and beer). I'm sure if you add that in - some would think this is by far the best option if you're looking for a buffet in Vegas.

For those who are on the strip, it's not an easy place to access unless you have a car and are willing to drive out and back. I was lucky to have a local with a car there to be chauffeur.

If I go back to Vegas and want a buffet, this probably wouldn't be my first choice. Favorite is still Wynn Buffet -- pricey, but you get what you pay for!",0,0,0

They have an amazing selection of salads, Mexican food, Asian food (including sushi, though the rice was stale), Indian food, American food and freshly cut prime rib, turkey and ham! Mashed potatoes and macaroni cheese with ham was a hit as well as pozole was delicious. 

Like many other buffets, the dessert section was holy. Tiramisu, oreo shake, cheesecake and even gelato at your service was definitely a touch of heaven :)

The food always looks so good here, so they get an A for presentation. However, the food is never as good as it looks, which is really disappointing.

I always seem to come back here, although my visits are never fully satisfying. I like the enormous variety of food that they offer and drinks. However, during my last visit on Christmas Eve, I was pretty disappointed.

The cost was around $35-40 for both brunch and dinner due to the holiday. There was no line outside, so we got seated right away. I ordered a cranberry juice and got an orange juice. I would have complained if the orange juice didn't taste good, but it was really good, so I left it alone. 

Nothing really stood out to me aside from the orange juice. Everything was just ok or subpar. I don't know if I I'll come back during a holiday anymore. I didn't notice any special holiday offerings to justify the high price they charged.",2,0,1

Long story short:  It was ok.  Not too memorable.  Probably not coming back.

Long story long:  It was a holiday weekend, and I knew the lines will be long at the various buffet joints on the strip.  So, I decided to leave the strip early in order to beat the traffic and the hungry mob.  

As usual...  there's a line when I got there.  Sign by the buffet line listed Weekend buffet special $33.99 for either brunch or dinner, and 200 dishes to choose from.  Complimentary Beer and Wine too (But I decided against this because having an alcoholic beverage + driving + stuck in traffic is probably not a good combo).

After paying at the cashier and getting a table near the station, I did my initial walk around the stations to see what they have.  After looking at the ""200 dishes"" they offered, I narrowed my top choices to be 1) Prime Rib, 2) Oyster, and 3) Crab Legs. 

Sadly, all three were a total FAIL.  Prime Rib was rough, Oyster was tiny (and looked disgusting after a few Asian ladies picked through all of them with their prongs), and Crab Legs were not tiny and not cut.  I literally spend over 60 minutes battling with my crab legs.

Better hurry because they literally don't last more than 10 minutes until they're gone and they have to add up another salmon.

This was my first visit to Studio B, which is located at the M Hotel. Yes it's a bit of a drive from the strip (~15 minutes), but I think it's worth it.

$30 for AYCE seafood buffet? Carving station? Dessert bar? INCLUDED wine and beer?? Specialty coffee bar (where you can ask to add in liquor)?? Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES!!

My top picks are the crab legs...they serve em cold AND hot, shrimp cocktail, raw oysters, beef stagonoff, clams in butter sauce, and peanut butter gelato (has bits of crushed peanuts in it). Prime rib was so-so (bland in my opinion). Everything else is standard buffet fare. 

What's nice is that they include alcoholic drinks with your meal. You have to go up to the front to get it, so be prepared to show ID. The have a few selections of wine and beer to choose from. I had a Berry Cider for my seafood and a PBR to wash down my meat. Yum yum!

Our lady hostess was a total bitch. She refused to seat everyone (total of 12 girls) together for who know what reason. They had the room, why not? Not to mention we waited about 45 minutes before mentioning that to us. Luckily our waiter, Diego, was able to seat us all together. He even pushed in an extra table for us! We joked about having him dance for his tip money, but he actually gave one of the girls a lap dance. I got front row seat! He must have a night time job with moves like that!

It's a great selection of tasty food (and alcohol!) for a value price. The hotel itself is also modern and pretty, and they still offer $5 min crap tables. So feel free to gamble a bit before heading back to the strip.

(?)

You may have heard from a friend about this buffet, or read the billboards coming into Vegas. That's what ""wetted my appetite."" As I was speeding into town for a trade show, I saw the word ""Best"" stood out on the billboard... alongside the word ""buffet."" And that' stuck with me from until Wednesday evening when  we drove over to the M for dinner.

For someone who's visited Vegas from the late 60's until today, I know that Vegas buffets fight for that ""Best Buffet"" position in this town. What caught me off center was that when I saw the billboard, I missed the whole phrase, which is, ""Best Buffet VALUE""... not the more direct ""best buffet""... which this certainly is not. However, I do have some positives, and points of redemption, although minimal.

Overall, the entree items were just OK to sub-par. The chicken enchilada and chicken tamale, sushi, Chinese food items, were not much better than fast food level. Their small offering of MIddle Eastern tabuli, hummus and stuffed grape leaves all had this weird taste. (?) The one item that saved it for me was the prime rib. And the best area of this buffet has to be the dessert bar. They have a gelato area with over 20 flavors. But other than that, this was sooo bad. It honestly reminded me of food you'd find at a Homestyle Buffet, which also reminds me of food in a chow hall. (and my references go back to things like ""Midnight Chow"" on the flight-line on Guam, circa '67... where chip beef on toast was the highlight of the day.)

Just to make sure it wasn't just me, I asked the opinion of a friend who lives in LV, and owns a delicatessen operation in town. She said they'd tried it, and it was, in her opinion too, horrible. We concured it was like eating buik packed frozen entree items you'd get from Costco. The saving grace was the staff. We found everyone to be very friendly. And I did give our server a healthy tip. But would I return? Only if I wanted to pay a little under $25 for unlimited wine, beer, gelato, cakes, pies and cookies. So if you've been doing some weed... and really have the munchies for sweets, beer and wine... this could be your place. 

And a footnote about ""best value."" The Barona Casino in San Diego County has a buffet that's about $24 list, with discounts on the buffet for joining their players club; you get about $8 off. But the difference there, is that the food is actually pretty decent. When I'm in Vegas, I'm not looking for a great value as much as great food. So yes, I would'a paid more for ""better.",7,4,3

They used to give you crab shelling tools, but now their crab legs are pre-opened for easier consumption. Go for the steamed crab legs, they're better than the cold ones. The pile of cocktail shrimp is always a mess.

The carving station is still pretty decent. They have sausages, turkey, and prime rib. The omelette station is pretty popular if you come for brunch.

Service: The cashiers are pretty friendly. But when it comes to those bussing your table... they have a look on their faces that says, ""I hate my job"". They do come by often and do a good job though, so I can and will excuse the sourpuss face. :) The people at the carving station have a hard time understanding English when I asked for a rare piece of prime rib.

The dessert station was another absolute pleasure.  We left feeling stuffed, which for us is a good thing for a Vegas buffet.   I mean, we certainly don't do it that often.

The only issue we had was sadly our server didn't arrive for about 20 minutes to take our beverage order.  We sat at the table for 10 minutes before going to the buffet and than gave up and went anyway.  Even after we all came back, another 10 minutes passed before she came by the first time.  

Overall, I would definitely come back again to Studio B.",6,0,0

It's like a god damn night club with the velvet rope bouncer letting a couple people in every 10 minutes.  If the food is any good I'll update the rating.

Update:
So we finally got seated, seems like the worst buffet line system ever.  Just like a nightclub, keeping the line long so it looks busy, but plenty of room inside.

The food selection was very good, seems to have more than a lot of the hotels on the strip.  Lunch was $15.99 and during our time there they changed over to dinner so we got dinner at the lunch price.

The good stuff: pork ribs, sliders, buffalo chicken slider, Chinese pork ribs, Kalbi ribs, beef brisket, chicken wings.  Others in our group liked the shrimp and crawfish.

Dessert: peanut butter gelato, creme brûlée, espresso, cappuccino.

They had root beer on tap which was pretty good and something I haven't seen before at a buffet.  Wine and beer we're also available.

Overall way better than the MGM buffet which was pretty bad and $32.99, I got it free and would rather pay for this buffet than eat at MGM for free.

Other than the insanely long and unnecessary wait to get in it's a good deal.  I will not return because of that reason.",1,1,0

The lines can get pretty long, so I suggest arriving early. And just because the first line you enter moves relatively quickly, doesn't mean that the second line you go in after you pay will be just as fast. Many a torturous minute I spent agonizing over the beholding sight of fresh seafood, crab legs and decadent desserts. 

But once you get in, prepare to race towards the seafood and pile your plate with fresh snow crab legs and sushi. And don't forget to ladle some of that hot, drawn butter for dipping. Mmm, butter. 

The rest of the food is pretty good, although I feel that they could actually have more choices of seafood besides the usual sushi, mussels and crab legs. The sushi is okay tasting but if you want sashimi, then just ask the chef for a plate of chopped sashimi. Besides seafood, you'll find the typical buffet fare such as prime rib, ham and turkey breast. 

The dessert section is awesome and offers a wide array of selections. Creme brulee, cupcakes, mereingue cookies, caramel flan, gelato and many other choices, eating dessert is equally as exciting as eating dinner. 

The seafood dinner buffet costs around $35, so be prepared to spend a little $$. Compared to the other buffets on the Las Vegas Strip, I'd say that this buffet trumps all the other top buffets.",0,0,1

In addition, the buffet selection is huge! There are so many delicious foods to try. Two of my favorite foods at Studio B included the sweet yams with marshmallows on top and the cucumber salad. 

Another great thing about this place: there is an open bar. You're welcome to drink as much as you'd like for as long as you'd like; you go up to a counter where someone is pouring drinks nonstop--help yourself. The cider wine was my favorite drink.

For the more ""gourmet"" buffet options in Vegas, Studio B is one of the best overall and the very best when it comes to what you get for your money. Depending on the time and day, it's anywhere between 16 and 40 dollars. I have only gone on the weekends and I think that their 40 dollar seafood and champagne weekend menu is worth the money. No matter when you go, beer, wine, and cordials are included in the price. Sure, not every food option is a winner (as is the case with any and every buffet), but there is enough variety to find PLENTY of things that you like. My very favorite favorite items are their masago mussels and their gelato. I've been to Wicked Spoon, the Buffet at the Bellagio, and a few others. Studio B is my favorite. 

During this first trip to Vegas, my then boyfriend proposed to me (yay). So, we decided to have a Vegas destination wedding in July 2015. We wanted to gamble then eat at a tasty buffet to celebrate after the ceremony. We decided to use Studio B Buffet for our reception and they were by far the best value for the money out of all the inquiries we made. There was no food and beverage minimum and the rental price for their private room\/show kitchen was super affordable for 3 hours. The room can accommodate up to 70 people. For our group of just under 30 guests, it was the perfect spot; there was even enough floor space for a group of our size to dance. 

Ventura at Studio B provided us with great customer service during the day of and even provided us with a free bottle of champagne. Our cake, made by Retro Bakery, was delivered to Studio B with no issues. When we realized our cake cutting set was missing, the buffet's dessert area happily provided us with a set. I'm grateful to Studio B for helping us have a fun and no-fuss wedding day!",3,1,1

Gelato is delicious.

1.  Cheap.  Lunch price is $15.99, which isn't bad at all considering the quality. 

2.  Free wine, Bud Light, and hard cider.  Can't beat that.

3.  Since it's so out in the middle of nowhere, easy to get in and out.

4.  Selection was very good.  Things I recommend - sashimi salad, oxtail soup, pork ribs, crème brule, fried Pollack. 



Things that were meh.

1.  The line was short when I arrived at 12:50 with a party of five.  But it took 30 minutes to get seated.  It wasn't packed, so they slow the flow down since there must be a limited number of servers, not because of a limited number of tables.

2.  The price is right, but still no local or military discount.  However, I'm fairly certain that 80% of the people eating were Clark County types.

3.  That pumpkin ice cream was unedible.

I don't understand buffets, and my stomach generally does not appreciate them. However, in a land of buffets, I think Studio B gets a solid B+. I am definitely no buffet expert, but I can say one thing for sure: There are a lot of choices at Studio B. 

For the most part, I think all buffets are overpriced because I usually end up eating vegetables, and it is hard to get $20something worth of salads. However, Studio B throws in beer and wine, and it is quite easy to get $20something worth of alcohol. Granted, I was drinking Coors Light, but someone told me the cider is tasty as well. Plus, they have root beer on tap. This impresses me. 

The salads were diverse and a-ok in the taste department. Furthermore, they had a curry selection that was as good as a curry from a jar that you can score at Trader Joe's. They had just straight up curry sauce that you could use to turn anything into a curry, so I snagged some tofu and drenched it. The result was a passable tofu red curry. The soups are also decent. 

For the real buffet experts, the seafood buffet on a weekend night is a treat with oysters, crab legs, shrimp galore, and several fish served up on some cedar blocks. Plus, the prime rib and other carved meats look nice. 

Then, there are the desserts. Sweet tooth heaven. Definitely the nicest looking selection I have seen. Plus, the lady serving up espresso was in the top 10 cheeriest people I have ever encountered.  

Expect to wait a long time during peak buffet hours, and the line for desserts gets pretty long too, but it moved pretty quickly.

I ate here with my bf on my way back home from Vegas for brunch and it was $44 per person, not including gratuity.  Price included unlimited mimosas, wine and beer, which wasn't optional.  This price is a RIP OFF, seeing that you can eat Bacchanal, Wynn or Cosmo buffet for around the same price for DINNER.  The food was in no way even close to what they serve at those places.  I think if the price was cut in half, I might have given it one more star.  

Food:  
Selection is decent.  There is your salad and soup areas, bfast section with an omelette station, seafood with crab legs, cocktail shrimp and oysters, sushi, prime ribs and steak, and Asian food section including kbbq and Chinese noodles.  The have a small dessert section, and I say small in comparison to Wynn's and the like.  I really liked that they had an espresso machine where the barista could make you a fancy caffeinated drink.  

Quality is just bad.  Crab legs are tiny and the meat is meager.  There is a slight aftertaste that I hate, which comes from not-so-fresh crabs.  The prime rib looked too well-done and the steak was also overcooked and just wasn't appetizing.  The rice on the sushi rolls were rock hard so I took off the rice and ate just the nori and the filling.  The lobster bisque was the worst I've ever had - can't really call it lobster bisque if there is no lobster in it.  Oysters were handled without much afterthought by the person putting them on the buffet line, and were not fresh.  Just anything I put on my plate, i took a bite of and gave up.  Even the chocolate souffle tasted like semi-wet chocolate flavored baby powder.  I felt bad for wasting all that food.

While on vacation in Las Vegas, we were surprised to learn that after 20+ years the prices of the buffets skyrocketed from the inexpensive cost of $5.99 to more than $70.00. The Rio buffet, in Vegas, was the first to feature the concept of eating around-the-world, with stations featuring many selections from different parts of the world, such as Germany, Italy, Mexico, France, Japan, China, and more for $5.99. You could stay there all day long and gorge yourself to your heart's desire.

When I reviewed the little booklet in our hotel room, it featured the Top Ten Buffets in Vegas. I was shocked not to see the Rio listed. I dug a little deeper and started reading reviews on Yelp about the buffets in Vegas and was thoroughly disappointed with the results. Not only did the prices increase 10-fold, but the review results of the food, presentation, and selection also failed miserably.

On the first day, we decided to go to my favorite hotel\/casino, the Bellagio for their buffet. We were not impressed. The hotel has not changed in 20 years, in fact, the once beautiful, flowery chandelier for which they are famous, appeared as though they skipped it during the cleaning process over the last 20 years. The hotel needs a facelift and a thorough cleaning. I'll save my comments of the buffet for another review.

After eating at a couple of other buffets with the same terrible results, I spoke to the desk agent at the MGM Grand where we were staying, and he recommended Studio B Buffet, at M Resort, in Henderson, outside of Vegas, or Wicked Spoon, at the Cosmopolitan.

We took his advice and traveled by taxicab to the M Resort for Studio B Buffet. The taxicab driver warned us that the cab ride one-way would cost approximately $40.00 because it was in Henderson. Now if you've never been to Las Vegas, Henderson is 11.7 miles, 19 minutes away from the Strip. Read my reviews Nellis Cab Company and LV Cabs to view the ridiculous monopoly by the Nevada Taxicab Authority ""cartel"" and the inept application called ""Curb."" 

The $100.00 roundtrip taxicab ride was worth the buffet at Studio B Buffet. I cannot begin to describe the M Resort's buffet experience accurately. You will have to view the pictures to get an idea of how superbly the food looks and take my word for how incredibly delicious it was. The website indicates that the price for an adult at lunchtime is $16.99, but the cost is closer to $19.00+ including taxes; Nevada State Tax = 8.25%.

There were over 200 selections of food with free beer and wine; a fantastic mix of typical and atypical dishes for each style that included Asian, Italian, Mexican, seafood, sushi, soups, barbecue, multiple carving stations for roast beef, turkey, ham and prime rib. The dessert bar included a variety of gelato, macaroons, a sugar-free selection, flan, crepes, cannolis and more. At the end of the dessert bar was an espresso bar that served your favorite coffee drinks, cappuccino, and espresso including those mixed with Sambuca, Irish Cream, and a few other liqueurs.

The buffet's walls held giant video monitors showing video clips of food preparations and favorite TV programming such as the Food Network.

I would highly recommend taking Uber, instead of a taxicab to the M Resort for the Studio B Buffet while in Las Vegas. There's enough there to eat once a day and be happy for the rest of the day. The cost of the buffet and Uber trip is less than what you would pay at a nice restaurant or another buffet on the Strip.",5,0,2

While the food is fresh, some of the meats were more on the overcooked side so I'd stick with the seafood. Shrimp is real fresh while I can't say the same for their oysters. Crab legs were constantly being refilled but I thought the baked mussels stood out more than the non cooked stuff. The rest of the dishes tasted fine but were nothing memorable, and I don't recall the desserts impressing much even with the blinging presentation.

Many of the hand-carved meats are on the dry side.  But they offered crawfish, fried shrimp, paella, creamed spinach, rice, salads, and pretty solid fish here too.  I loved their shrimp dishes and their pork offerings.   

There are a lot of misses, but they have enough hits to make this a great outing.   Particularly if you come with the intent on drinking a lot of beer.  If you don't like alcohol, I recommend that you hit up their root beer on tap.   It's pretty good.  

Overall...the reason I'd come back is because they have enough good entrees that you will go home full and happy.   More importantly, they have an awesome price point and unlimited beer.  

The cons are that not all of the food is great and that it's located 10 miles off the strip.  

My favorite buffet in Vegas is the wicked spoon because of their willingness to offer creative entrees that you'd normally see in nice restaurants.  Second would be Bellagio because of its standout desserts and great entrees.   I'd rate this as a viable contender for third best buffet in Vegas.  Check it out as you leave the strip.",3,2,2

It's been about 5 years since I was here last with my wife and sadly it was not good then.
The food was not prepared very well and I remember just a few people behind the scenes running around trying to keep up with the demand, so many empty food warmers!
I had a beer back then too and it was only Pabst Blue Ribbon, now there is about 5 to 6 different beers on draught and I must say the green colored tap was a tasty ale that had a kick to it!
Today's lunch was EXCELLENT! good food, great service from Elaine.

I'm impressed and now a fan!

I wouldn't go back to this buffet though since there wasn't anything special or memorable about it. Maybe for $10 but definitely not worth $25. After dinner though the line was incredibly long.

First of all, Studio B is rather cheap compared to all the other buffets that are on the strip. Seafood brunch during the weekend was only $33.99! Unlike many other buffet, Studio B also provides OYSTERS. And not to mention, unlimited wine and mimosa! No wonder everyone raves that it's the best buffet in Vegas. But beware, Studio B line can get super long so try to go early! My friends and I went around 10 or 1030am on Saturday morning and we got seated right away even though we had a group of 7.

However, the oysters looked really grey\/black and didn't taste fresh at all. I still ate at least 15 just for the hell of it but couldn't get myself to get a second plate full of oysters, which was a bummer. :T

But crab legs on the other hand was BOMBdotcom. Crabs legs were moist and meaty. The legs might not be the thickest crab legs but it definitely was one of the fresher crab legs I've ate in Vegas buffet!

I didn't try much brunch food because I was all about Seafood but I ate some of their pasta and it tasted delicious. It didn't taste like it was some filler meal that the chefs tried to prepare real quick. All my friends also said their food was great and it was worth their money.

And last but not least, their dessert bar! I was already so full so I couldn't try anything but their gelato but their gelato was SO GOOD! I somehow managed to eat at least two cups of it :)

PS. Studio B also gets brownie points because their servers are nice. This Asian lady in front of me wanted single scoop of each gelato even though the buffet only served th gelato in cup or cone. Then the server told the Asian lady to go get a large plate and he scooped her each flavor of gelato for her and put it all in a plate! (That was like total of 12 scoops) What a nice man. :D",1,1,1

From the moment I walked up to the line there was no waiting. I had a good seat, which I kinda fought for, I was by myself and didn't want to sit at a table for four..lol ..how dumb is that..haaaaaaa ..

As I was walking to my seat I saw a delicious grilled piece of beef on someone else's plate. So I bee lined straight to it. All the beef was well seasoned and juicy and tender. That grilled piece of beef was amazing ! The prime rib was awesome. Note the rice pilaf was beautifully blended and the best tasting rice pilaf I've had in some time. The vegetables were very fresh with a tad bit of crunch to it as well as seasoned nicely.

I had a dish called Jamaican salad and that was a nice surprise,very tropical and fresh , which is a must try. I had the blackened salmon which was near the Asian food and it was the business. I can taste the many different flavor it was infused with and the spinach on top gave it a very nice tune.

Now the desert... Mmmm..mmm.mm.. Nothing short of brilliant. I always eat there desert here because unlike other buffet the really put a lot into their selection,presentation,flavor and beautiful creations of lovely treats. I never eat deserts anywhere else. I always make room for their desert and it you know me, that says a lot ! 

The open bar thing is very convenient and they always have a smile like they are ado glad you stopped in to grab a cold one.
I had the mimosa which I didn't really like, it was a little too brut for my taste. I like sweet champagne type drinks if I'm going to indulge..lol but the girl that served it had a beautiful smile si I suppose it was worth the walk.:-D

So to say that Studio B. Is not the best buffet , you would only be lying to yourself...lol .. I will admit I saw one fly go by me. 
Which did not ruin my day. I had a pleasant trip. As I ate I watched t.v. food network on the multi screens and watched people eat as well. A day I say well spent. Thank you Studio B.

We do not have to wait this long in the other buffets on the strip. Each time we attempted to give up and leave, the line started moving, so we decided to stay. There are 3 lines after you pay. 1 is for VIP, 1 is for parties of 5 or more, and the other is for 4 or less. My advice is to keep track of the groups around you because people like to take advantage of the line just to be seated asap. Parties of 3 were in the 5 or more line and were going to be seated before us (party of also 3) and we were there before them. My mother was livid and blew up on the seating hostess because they are not paying attention to the amount of people in the proper lines. We were sat before the other party of 3, but still!

Soo this buffet (inside M casino) had a very high reputation when they first opened but they've dipped in some areas. But in my opinion, still deserve a high rating as long as you:

- DON'T GO TO ANY OF THEIR SEAFOOD BUFFETS! Honestly they add only like 3 different options for seafood and they are not great at all. I remember their lobster was mainly just stuffing! Ack!

- Avoid going during any major holiday! Especially Mother's Day! Was $49.99 a person and we were all disappointed especially after waiting 2 hours! 

-Only go to their Monday-Friday Lunch from 11am-2:30pm for $15.99. Same quality as the Dinner and Seafood Buffet in my opinion without their measley 3 extra options lol.

Hours of Operation:
Lunch= Mon. - Fri. 11:00am - 2:30pm $15.99
                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $11.99

During my most recent visit a few days ago for Lunch, it was exactly like I remembered! Tons of vegetarian options including about 10 different salads and I love the mushroom ravioli! But they also offer prime rib, fried chicken, green mussels, pad thai, yellow curry, all the usual chinese options, tomato bisque soup, pastas, jambalaya and a lot of the other usuals but done better than most buffets. And of course, their infamous desserts! Just try like all of them, you won't regret it. Well, maybe your pants will lol. But overall, I still love this buffet. I just won't waste my time and money for anything besides their lunch! Enjoy! :)",27,11,12

We did the seafood dinner buffet which is offered Friday-Sunday evenings.  We paid $39.99. If you get a $25 voucher or a comp ticket, you can skip the long line and just enter at the VIP line. 

What I like about this buffet is that it has a huge array of food and the quality is pretty good.  

I will list some food items off the top of my head, which I remember (exact name may not be correct):


----American----
Sweet potato\/yam casserole - pretty good, and not overly sweet 
Prime rib - really good, but they carve large sections 
Baked chicken
Crab legs - both steamed and cold - legs are not giant, but the restaurant cuts the legs in half for you, lengthwise, which is a big help!! 
Oysters
Baked mussels in an orange sauce - YUM
Sweet potato fries and regular fries
Butter-drenched corn on the cob
A Mexican corn on the cob 
Loaded baked potatoes 
Creamy scalloped potatoes 
Fried fish sticks - large rectangles and not pre-frozen
Huge meatballs
Spaghetti 
Lobster mac and cheese 

----Asian----
2-3 different types of sushi rolls
Tuna and salmon nigiri
Pho soup, with all the toppings!
Pad Thai, with toppings you can add onto as well 
Ox tail
Balsamic rice with raisins
Chana masala?  (I think so. Chickpeas in a good sauce)
Coconut Curry chicken 
Korean Garbi short ribs
Pork spare ribs with ginger and honey
Thai papaya salad

They had other food too including ceviche, but I didn't venture out more than most of the above 

As for dessert, they no longer have a crepe bar, BUT their dessert bar is huge and plentiful.  My favorites were the bread pudding, which was like a nice fluffy cake with a slightly crispy edge (just the way I like it!!  And it tasted sooo good!), the little shooter glasses of Tiramisu and other options, and the gelato ice cream.  The have like 12-16 flavors!!  I tried the coconut, mango, coffee, and vanilla ice creams.  All were tasty and pretty fresh tasting - was not old ice cream for sure. 

The little mini pecan tarts (the small circles) weren't that great so I wouldn't recommend those.  The cookies were good though.",1,0,2

Reminder:  groups larger than 9 people--18% gratuity. I came with a group of 10, so it was roughly 23-24 bucks a person or so for lunch.  But the general price of like 20 bucks a person is so worth it.  There's a pretty good variety of food.  Beer and wine is included (OMGAH!)

They have a pretty decent selection of food.  The seafood buffet dinner on selected days is pretty good too.  The shrimp and oysters were tasty, but the quality of the oysters were so-so.  The line for the seafood is ridiculous.

I've been meaning to go for a few years now, but it's never been convenient until this last trip. When my friend said she wanted to have a lunch buffet before hitting the pool (a bad idea, in my opinion - ha), I immediately suggested Studio B! It was supposed to be epic. 

It wasn't. 

The buffet was small. Maybe this is because it was brunch? My prime rib was dry and unappetizing, and the crab selection was a joke. The pieces were small and rarely refilled. It was still crab, so I ate my fill regardless, but I was disappointed. The rest of the food was subpar, though the desserts were decent. 

We did have two mimosas each, so that was nice, and the price was lower than most other buffets. Even still, I don't see myself driving back out again. I'd rather go to Bacchanal at Caesar's.",5,7,4

I paid less than $hungry. 20 for their lunch buffet and if I had to pay more, I would do it. Every single food they serve is really delicious and full of flavor. They serve menu items from all over the world. One of my favorites from the Asia section is their Pad Thai an Singapore noodles. Their Pad Thai was a little spicy which made the dish more appetizing. From their carving station, I got a slice of rib. The employee who helped me was not very friendly. He didn't even know how to say ""you're welcome"" after I said, ""thank you."" No words came out of his mouth. Our server on the other hand was extremely awesome. She was very friendly and also told us about their seafood dinners (can't wait to try that).

If you answer these questions ""YES"" then you need to read no further. Studio B is the best option for you. Put it into your phone GPS and start making your way over. 

Studio B started a trend that the Cosmopolitanism and Caesars have been following up on in recent years of revamping the quality of the Vegas buffet. It's lost its new charm and appeal, but is still a damn good option for a large meal in the city of sin. 

Studio B being off the strip is often less popular for the mass crowds. Its clientele is a little different, but that's okay. The food is well worth the drive. Weekday pricing of ~$25 is an unbelievable deal considering the quality that you are receiving. Almost everything here is good, even if you are not coming on seafood night. Meats, Asian, Italian, American, Mexican, the staples are all here. They even serve limitless draft beer, cider, root beer, and wines for your enjoyment. Something most other places will make you pay an extra premium for. The deserts are top tier also with a myriad of gelato and pastries.

We had the seafood buffet, where there was a large variety of items, all made by school cafeteria cooks. All the meats were well, well done and dry, and you had ""hot"" crab legs that had simply been baking under heat lamps for hours, not actually fresh out of a boiling pot like any other place.

They were slow and skimpy with nicer foods - the carvers at the meat stations would take frequent breaks and let a line build up, and the sushi section was simply empty and unstocked 4 out of 5 times I passed by.  There were several sections on the right side that were *labeled* with nicer foods like smoked salmon or trout, but had been simply replaced by salads instead. Crepes were pre-made and pre-packaged with toppings, and they only give you a 1\/4 slice of a crepe at that. My standard drink is an orange juice at buffets, which every other has a real version of - the M Resort served up some hideous Sunny D from concentrate concotion.

The waiter service wasn't very attentive, and both us and the table next door ended up stacking about 25 plates on an empty nearby table before someone came to pick them up.

That hasn't even gotten to the $40 per person cost for lunch, for which they tack on the mandatory cost of alcohol even if you don't drink. That's in the same category of the Bellagios and Wynns and Caesar's of Vegas, all of which are more centrally located and actually serve decent food. The line also took about an hour, at around 2-3 on a Saturday.

If you're looking for a buffet and nowhere close to the strip, go to a buffet at one of the Station casinos - it's a $7.99 (vs. $40) lunch and the food is hands-down BETTER.",1,1,2

To be fair, there were some outstanding dishes.  The prime rib, for example, was outstanding.  The dessert bar had a great selection of gelato and sorbets. 

Compared to other buffets it rates a 7 on a10 point scale.  By comparison, I would rate the brunch buffet at the Sheraton Grand in San Francisco is a 9.5.  The best is the breakfast buffet at the Shangri-la in Hong Kong [a definite 10!]

 But all in all, I don't think it was worth the 4 hour wait.  On that note, I think the restaurant could do a better job of managing the long lines.  Knowing that there will be large crowds, they should let customers check in and either have them return at a specified time rather than wait in a long meandering line.

There are many food options and you're bound to find something you like.

For a buffet it was OK, I have had much worst. Just like most Vegas buffets the selection was huge, But most of it was luke warm and average. The crab legs were small and but tasted OK, the prime rib was extremely rare and I even asked for an end cut. I can't imagine what the center of that thing looked like. And the lamb was inedible. The oysters were warm which made my whole party scared so no one ate any. The shell somehow was ice cold but the actual meat of the oyster was warm. Their gelato was just a richer ice cream, no where close to gelato. But hey at least they tried. And their beer and wine selection was very limited. I didn't expect a full bar menu but I was hoping that they would have more than just bud light and few other similar mass produced domestics. If they just threw in one import or local craft-brew I would have been very happy. According to the lady pouring they used to have a really good selection but then they ""went cheap""....her words not mine. 

So based on all of these negative things I have said the reason I gave this place 3 stars is because I have been to plenty worse buffets. It just a fact that when it comes to buffet you sacrifice quality for quantity. But if thats what you want then this is one of the better buffets. Heck my finace' went with her girlfriends the night before to the buffet at the New York New York ( I think) and both her and another one of her girlfriends who where with us said this one was better.

The food seemed like just regular buffet food.  The oysters were not good (not fresh or something to that effect because I could barely eat one).  Now I understand that it's a buffet, but I expected better.  After going one round and trying different foods that looked like it would be worth it, I used all the eating space I had left loading up the crab legs.

I've never been to a buffet with such fresh crab legs. And this is SNOW crab, not the chewy bland king crab legs that you can find anywhere else.  They offer both hot and cold versions, along with a ginger-stir fried version in the Asian cuisine section. I found the hot version to be the best (the stir-fried version had meat that was dried out probably because it was kept over heat)...the best meaning I had two plates of snow crab legs all to myself.  AH!

There is a round carving\/meat station in the center of the buffet where you can find prime rib (and a variety of sauces), NY steak, salmon, rotisserie chicken, fried chicken, turkey, pork, etc......There's an entire row dedicated to salads and fruit.  Their soups included lobster bisque (which was quite delicious!)  For the ethnic stations, I really appreciated the more authentic-style Asian dishes such as eggplant with black bean sauce (pretty decent!), braised oxtail, and yuxiang beef (though I would have preferred it cooked with the more traditional pork).  You don't typically see these served at other buffets.  There was also sushi and Thai.

Their fruit was super sweet and fresh and their dessert station is to die for!  The selection was almost too much to bear -- too little stomach space left ='(, but such a feast for the eyes.  But I did the wasteful thing (bad me, I know) and tried like 10 things because I couldn't resist.  The flan and creme brulee = AMAZING.

For brunch, there are 3 different wines to choose from and 6 different beers on tap. If you are a red wine lover like me you will love their red wine, it's a little sweet but perfect. As for their dessert, they have really good smoothies, ice cream, and an assortment of desserts.

To top this all off, the staff is very nice and attentive. Our waiter would always check up on us and would refill our drinks constantly. This is one of the best buffets that I have been to and what makes it better is that it's super cheap compared to the strip buffets that don't compare to this. I would definitely recommend this place and I will go again on my next vegas trip!",3,0,0

1- Unlimited Beer + Wine - Yay, but I ended up just sipping on the root beer from tap

3. Prime rib\/Lamb\/NY Steak\/Korean BBQ\/ other meats - all were really good surprisingly 
4. Sushi\/sashimi salad - meh

But I definitely feel that it is a solid 4\/5 star. I will agree with him on two things - 1. I'm not crazy about the salad bar because it's a lot of pre-mixed options and you don't have the ability to build your own. 2. Most every meat I tried was dry - I guess they'd been sitting out too long?

However, there were quite a few more important factors (in my eyes) that made me really enjoy this place. Mostly, the amazing selection! I couldn't get over the fact that there were three different kinds of ribs to try! They had some super delicious fried chicken - far more flavorful and crunchy than I have found at any buffet. And, I could build my own loaded fries - a mix of waffle and sweet potato fries, cheese sauce, shredded cheese and carnitas. 

Last, but certainly not least, the desserts! Not only did they offer several minis that were delicious (including Creme Brûlée and chocolate mousse), but I was also able to build my own amazing sundae! They had an incredible rich chocolate flourless cake that I covered with a scoop of peanut butter gelato, mini M&M's, chopped peanuts, sprinkles, crushed Oreos and hot fudge. I was in heaven!! 

Thank goodness hubby said that he's willing to give this place another shot, because I can't wait to go back!!",8,2,6

He was not a good waiter and would just drop our drinks on the table without even saying excuse me and towards the end of our meal he didn't even pick up the plates, another waitress had to pick them up for him.

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(

Also I'm not a big fan of buffets, the food is cheap meat and vegetables cooked with who knows what to make them taste good, but that's just me.

The all you can drink beer or wine something never see any other buffet. Certain days they have seafood day the day I went with friends visiting out of town. You know the day because not only is it hell of busy but the line for the crab legs cold or hot can be ridiculous. They put out whole tray then four or five people later its gone end up waiting again. Still worth the wait. The dessert section another part that stands out. Sure they have normal small petite fours of desserts on plates, also have whole gelato section have over ten flavors choose from, and even do mocha or cappucino order.

Dismal selection. The crab legs were primarily exoskeletons with very little meat. The legs were also very small. They had shrimp tempura.....but no tempura sauce.  Bread was at one end of the buffet line, but the butter was at the far end of the line at the salad bar.  It looked like there was a gyro station with all the condiments like tzatziki sauce, chopped onions, and shredded lettuce....but no pita bread or meat. ???

There were many various individual food items, but nothing you could build a meal with. The items just didn't seem to go together.

The food displays were just plain messy. There were dropped and spilled food parts all over the the buffet line, and cross contamination everywhere. It's like they just don't care anymore.

You might feel a bit wary since M is way off the strip, and there are so many other buffets you could choose from, but I've been to the rest and they just can't compare with Studio B. Since it's pretty much a ""secret"" atm, the lines are at a minimum. The crab was just as good as everyone else proclaimed and thankfully there are THREE seafood stations so no one ever gets angsty or impatient. (Btw: crab + clam chowder = AMAZING).. So I might be a bit biased with my rating, because any place that has all you can eat sashimi is a true winner. For a buffet in the dessert, the sushi was surprisingly fresh and flavorful! 

I basically got my money's worth in the seafood, however I did have an entire plate dedicated to JUST meat. If you're more of a carnivore, go straight to the juicy NY Steaks. They're a bit small, but who cares? All you can take! Then on your way back, make a detour to the Korean BBQ, which is so tender. Here's a hint: forget the pastas! Although the mac&cheese was good, the beef stroganoff and the baked ziti typed one tasted a bit weird. You should really avoid the carbs altogether to save room for the proteins.. and the DESSERTS!!!

Ohohoho.. Freshly made fruit crepes! Eat them THERE, because if you want one on the strip, that's gonna cost you like 8 bucks. It's not made to order, but if there's no one in line you ask the crepe-maker if they can hook you up. I ordered a crepe just covered with whipped cream and chocolate.  Times 5. My other favorites were the creme brulee, the eclairs, and the tiramisu. Don't bother with pecan pie - it was way too tart. I finished off with a couple soops of Mango gelato at the gelato station and of course a small cup of mocha cappucino at the barista (at the end of the dessert bar, it's easy to miss).

In some ways it is still a great place to experience a Vegas Buffet. Their selection is huge, but typical of Vegas. I do love their unique dishes though, particularly their Ox tail soup, it's got a great asian flavor. On weekends I am there for the crab legs and fresh oysters. Their oysters are pretty good, very sweet! Crab legs are a little dry and skimpy. Other side dishes are pretty good too... mainly their au gratins are super creamy and rich.

Our party ate at the Studio B Buffet on 12\/31\/2011, and our party waited approximately 4 hours before we were seated.  Thanks to my friend's awesome daddy, he spared us 2 hours of waiting in line for a seat.  If you're coming to Studio B Buffet during the holidays, be prepared for a long wait.  It definitely pays to have someone get in line by 4:30 pm-ish in order to get seated a little after 8:30 pm ish.  

We sat in an area where guests can also enjoy a show where someone prepares food and starts doing tricks in the kitchen.  We didn't get to see any show, but the seating arrangement was interesting (kind of like a tiered amphitheater). 

FOOD:
- Fresh poke
- Lobster (the lobster was cut in half and had a full lobster tail as well as stuffing (imitation crab, lobster meat and other ingredients) in the body)
- Great beef wellington (so tender and juicy)
- Apricot and fruit-stuffed meats (like chicken, pork tenderloin, etc.)
- Delicious salads with sweet and tangy fruits and cheeses.
- Hot and cold crab legs (sweet, not salty, just perfect!)
- They have a whole Asian buffet bar section, as well as Italian and Mexican foods.  Very good selections.

VALUE
This place definitely provides guests with the best value for their money.  During New Years, the buffet was $39.99 per person.  Not bad considering other buffets (like at the Wynn and Bellagio) were charging over $65 per person.

DRINKS
- They have just about everything to drink.  Plus, unlimited wine and beer.  WIN!  They also have an area where you can order freshly made cappuccinos and espressos.  What a nice way to finish the meal.

DESSERT
- YUM!  Studio B Buffet has an expansive dessert bar with several gelatos, mousse, puddings, cakes (the chocolate molton cake was sinfully delicious and rich) and fruits.

More importantly, the food is outstanding on every level - taste, preparation, variety.  A couple of things here and there that are just so-so, but overall, the food is remarkably good.  TIP:  Take tiny portions of everything that looks good.  Savor each bite.  Appreciate it.  Don't just woof it down like a seagull!  Take your time and enjoy.  There's plenty of time and food.

You can tell that they really put quality above quantity. The prime rib was pretty good for a AYCE. The asian dishes were perfectly seasoned to bring out the freshness of the ingredients they choose to utilize. 

The thai food was very authentic. The panang curry had the perfect texture and the pad thai noodles were cooked just right.

The icing on the cake is of course the deserts. It's chocolate heaven!

That was enough for my gf Diane & I to dive in. We were celebrating her brother Michael's birthday for the 4th of July. Her family had already been here a few times already & had waited up to 2 hrs. to get in. 

Given it being a weekday, especially a day after a major holiday. We expected the line to be shorter than usual. It was only $13 per person, so I really suggest you hit this on a weekday. The line moved fast so we were seated within a half hr. 

The set up in the place is awesome! Swanky, hip, & sexy, whoever did the decor @ Studio B, I applaud you. I can't even properly explain how to describe the set up because I'm not a fashionable architectural guru. But I will promise you that you will like it. Modern but cozy, with about a hundred or so tv's that work in unisen to make a huge screen up on top of one side of the buffet. 

The buffet itself has an ecclectic variety of food. From Pad Thai to meat loaf, carne asada & sushi. 

Here's what I had:

scrambled eggs- awesome!
tons of bacon- awesome!
bbq ribs- tasty, but not mind blowing
chile verde-  was ok
meatloaf-  was ok
korean bbq ribs- my favorite thing from the buffet, superb, great flavor!
pineapples, cantelope, honey dew - all fresh & tasty
macaroni salad- tasty
breakfast sausage- very tasty
pizza bread- tasty
peach w\/ cottage cheese- was ok

The dessert was what really put everything over the top. I would have given this place a 4 star review, but yeah those desserts were amazing. 
I had:

cannolis-delicious
ecclairs-delicious
pistachio gelato- delicious
raspberry crepes- delicious
flan- delicious
cream puffs- delicious

They even had free beer on tap. I left here feeling really really satisfied. Especially hearing David Bowie's ""Ziggy Stardust"" while I was in line @ the dessert section. That totally gave them ""cool points"" from me. Bowie @ buffets? Haha alright alright, what else do you have? Check this place out, I'm sure you'll find something worth coming back to.",3,1,1

Really good - they also have extra spicy tuna off to the side that you can add to the top of this. mm so good. the shrimp pad tai was really good also. Ooh and the orange chicken I had a piece and it was really good. 

I also tasted a piece of bamboo salmon or mahi mahi - I wasnt impressed at all. But the sweet potatoes were delicious. Probably the best I've ever tasted. They also serve wine- no riesling but they have chardonnay, cabernet sav, white zif, and you can tip the servers. The dessert line is insane! I didnt even taste the desert the 1st visit. The 2nd time I tasted chocolate souflee wow! That was the best thing I tasted that day. My bf had a great piece of cheesecake, What wasnt good was the creme brulee. UM no. I was most excited about that and it ended up being not great. Kinda sad b\/c I've been craving creme brulee for years. yup years. Kinda a let down. THey have everything from icecream, cookies, cakes, pies, crepes, cheesecake, pecan pie, bread pudding. (pass) Its endless. This is probably one of the best buffets in the city.

Honestly, I don't think it's worth it. All they had were some nasty dry crab legs, some raw oysters, and some shrimp cocktail, and they charged us an arm and a leg. Throw in some lobster tails or something, and then maybe I could justify the price, but it just wasn't that good for what we paid. 

Compared to other buffets in Vegas, the quality of the food here just wasn't up to par. It definitely wasn't worth $43 for dinner. I'd at most pay $25-$30 for what they were serving.

Bad side? The resort is off the strip, way off. However, if you do find the time to drive about 10 miles down Las Vegas Blvd, you will see the most beautiful blue building literally in the middle of nowhere. When you go inside the building, go up the escalators, past the lobby filled with the beautiful white tulips, down the endless rows of casino tables and slot machines and you will finally see it. The Studio B buffet. OMG.

Hands down, most variety of food I've seen in any Vegas buffet (including Rio and Paris), and best tasting overall. They've got sushi, chinese food, thai food, italian food, the largest variety of salads of any buffet AND an open bar. HELL YEA! Did I mention that their dessert section has a full service gelato stand? HELL YEA!

The prices of this beautiful man-made heaven goes like this: you'll find the cheapest prices for lunch on a WEEKDAY only. On weekends it is only brunch, which is about $25 I believe. Dinner is about $32 and that includes the seafood buffet (seafood buffet = crab legs, shrimp, and oysters). I don't really care to spend my time and energy cracking those crab legs, plus I don't really care for oysters, so the lunch buffet is good enough for me! 

BTW, it can get REALLY crowded around 7 or 8 for dinner, so try to come earlier like around 5 or 6. The wait can get REALLY long (once it was about 45 minutes!)

I don't care for the higher quantity\/lower quality food that is served at these places and I no longer feel the need to recoup my gambling losses by gorging myself at the buffets.

However, I like Studio B. It's located in the beautiful, low-key M Resort and the quality of the food here is better than other buffets. The entire place is clean and the service is excellent. There's something for everyone here and while it won't all taste great, most of it is fresh and delicious. I'm very happy that the mac-and-cheese that my nieces and nephew were eating did not look like the slop that most places serve. The kids also enjoyed the pizza and a few of the Asian noodle dishes.

As for my most recent trip, I liked the seafood selections (good tuna poki and a fresh salmon salad) and the not-so-standard-for-a-buffet dishes (pineapple jicama salad). During past visits, I've chowed down on the crab legs, oysters, clams, carved meats, tater tots (yes!), and much more. The dessert and coffee bar are excellent as well.

I did like the skirt steak and the steamed clams and mussels. The dessert area was completely filled with deluctable desserts to try. Bad idea having the espresso machine and ice cream scooping station all where the desserts are because that caused a HUGE traffic jam.

But to call it a seafood buffet on Sunday nights and charge $40 is VERY misleading! Tonight we arrived at around 4:15. NO WAIT! I took a walk around to check out the seafood...split crab legs, warm and chilled; mussels; chilled shrimp; oysters; crawfish. The crab legs were small so when split, they seemed less meaty. Disappointed with the crab legs but enjoyed everything else. Started with a Greek salad, dolmas, baba ganoush which were all very tasty. Also had char siu pork, pork bbq rib, black pepper chicken, Mac n cheese which was probably the most bland, but went great with the pork. Sauce was creamy and cheesy, but almost flavorless. I must admit I got more with a grilled lamb chop -it just went well with the grilled meats. Second trip I got the crab legs - I should have waited for some fresh ones, fried shrimp, with warm cocktail sauce (+) , which were nice and crisp and quite flavorful. I saw fresh crab legs coming out so decided to get some. It amazes me how people get pushy when it comes to crab legs! I also tried some mussels which were a little chewy, probably best served in a bowl cuz I like to slurp the broth out of the shell with the meat. The prime rib looked good, as did the fried chicken (nice large pieces which were breaded nicely and looked crispy. I was going to have some with Mac n cheese. Next time...). The beet salad was delicious and I also had a wedge to which I added cucumber tomato salad and some olives and bleu cheese. 3 bean salad was just ok (green, kidney, and Lima beans). Didn't have enough room to try more Asian cuisine. The General Tso chicken looked awesome! Oh forgot to mention the Kaluha pork just melted in my mouth...very tender with tasty cabbage throughout. Would have liked to try some lobster bisque, mashed sweet potatoes, stuffing, roasted chicken. Such a great selection of food. One of the best!",1,0,0

Came here for their seafood buffet for a second time and it was just as good as I remembered. Cheap too! In comparision to the buffets on the strip, this seafood one is $33.99. Not too shabby at all.

Love the fact that they have STEAMED crab legs. They are just so much tastier than the cold cocktail ones. Oysters, clams, shrimp cocktails, the works! I stuck with the oysters and crab legs and got my money's worth for sure. The other stuff I didn't really try because I was so focused on crab legs. The tidbits I did try were really good as well. The mac and cheese was deliciously cheesy, the sashimi salad was delicious. 

Unlimited beer and wine! Just remember to tip! AND they have root beer on draft! Hit up their dessert bar and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it's a great end to a fabulous dinner.

PRIME RIB - needed a little salt but the meat was soft and tender.
BBQ RIBS - fall apart tender and the bbq sauce was great. I like that they have the sauce on the side so you can put as much as you want.
BEEF STROGANOFF - one of my favorites! Thick and creamy just the way it should be and the beef was so tender.
BRAISED BEEF - nice and soft but I had to add salt.
CHINESE - the chow fun was really flavorful and the kung pow chicken was good but nothing out of this world. 
I didn't waste my time on the salads. But they all looked really fresh and pretty.
PIZZA - the pizza is awesome! It's thin crust and they had a few selections but I had the pepperoni. The cheese was so gooey and yummy.
TOMATO BISQUE SOUP - amazing but I only took a little because I didn't want to fill up
PASTA - just ok, nothing special. I liked that they had gnocci that was different. 
MAC AND CHEESE - one of the best I've had, I went back for seconds.
DESSERT - the lemon meringue tart was my favorite and I liked their gelato bar they had a lot of flavors and a variety of toppings. 
SUSHI - I didn't try this since I'm from Hawaii and the sushi looked mediocre compared to what we have back at home.

Overall this was one of the beat buffets I've been to because you can taste the quality of the food. Everything is fresh and the flavors are distinct. I would definitely go back, next time for the weekend seafood buffet.

The number of foods to choose from were out of this world. I'll recommend some of my favorite things to eat.

Salmon sushi: Some pieces were beautifully fatty. I ate loads of this and threw away the rice. 

Prime rib: When you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then it's awesome. So juicy and tender. 

Mimosa: endless amounts of champagne and oj. I left this place stumbling!

A cool tip is to try to show up right before 4 and pay the lunch price. They don't have a silly rule like other buffets and kick you out before they serve the dinner menu. Why not save the extra bucks?

The resort seemed nice enough. This review is just for the food. 

First thing first....All you can drink wine and beer. So the wine wasn't the best quality but it was nice and chilled and a major bonus since I wasn't expecting it. The buffet boasted over 200 items to choose from. It was presented very nicely and the overall feel of the place felt very open and spacious. Everything we tried was flavorful and piping hot. Which was a bit of a pleasant surprise. Since it was close to Chinese New Years they had a very large Asian selection. The korean ribs were amazing as well as the orange chicken. I love ginger and they had fresh chopped ginger as a garnish. Who does that? Kudos for all the fresh condiments.

We are not much into seafood but saw that everyone else was. Plates and plates of crab legs, oysters and mahi mahi. There was shrimp cooked in multiple ways and all kinds of sauces to dip into. 

Asian, Italian, American and everything in between there was something for everyone. And the dessert spread was amazingly good. They have over 25 flavors of gelatto and you can also have a latte or mocha made fresh! They had some pistachio raspberry concoction that was just way too good to pass up.  

The only  negative was the wait..... but it is well worth it. We waited for about 45 minutes and there was only 4 couples ahead of us. So patience is key.",0,0,0

The seafood brunch price is crazy cheap for what you get, and if you come right before the brunch ends, it's not so crowded and you get both brunch and the start of dinner - score!

There was soooo much food, it was overwhelming.  They had Asian food, big salad bar, carving station, pastas, and then the seafood....  There were piles and piles of steamed crab legs, cold crab legs, and crab in sauce, salmon cooked on bamboo, you name it.  Admittedly i didn't go for the crab (i know, crazy huh?) cause i didn't want to go all ballistic on it in public without the right tools, which we couldnt' find.  I was all over everything else though.  I would list what I ate, but I can't even remember.  But I know I liked everything I tried!

That said, Studio B buffet is really quite good. But for $2 more, you can get dinner at the Bellagio buffet (weekdays) which is lightyears better.  That was the main thing going through my head as we sampled Studio B last night... this is nearly as expensive as Bellagio and just not as good.

The Asian dishes were tasty and well-spiced.  My Kalibi ribs were cold, but whatever.  The green curry with beef was surprisingly spicy, even if the beef was overcooked and consequently tough.  My husband raved about his Beef Satay skewers.

The Ragu Bolognese was very tasty, but the gourmet-looking Mac & Cheese was bland.  The rotisserie chicken was moist and delicious, but the Bratwursts with apples & onions was tasteless.  The Oaxacian shrimp was very tasty it it's mild green chile sauce, but the accompanying tortillas were dried out and stale.

There was quite a selection there on the buffet, lots of seafood - and this wasn't a ""seafood"" night at Studio B.  Lots of mussels, clams and fried seafood.  I was disappointed in the butterflied fried shrimp and fried clams - both were greasy and overcooked.

Yes, there's AYCD beer and a couple of wines.  I didn't notice the hard cider until it was too later.  But the addition of alcoholic beverages doesn't make up for this buffet just not-quite getting there.

The desserts were hit and miss.  The chocolate souffle was to die for, but the tiramisu was oddly foamy and way too wet.  The crepes with berries were lovey, but the carrot cake was gross.  The coconut macaroons were divine, but the lemon meringue tartlets were bland and over-sweet.  We didn't get to the gelato, but there were a lot of flavors to choose from.

All in all, I might be tempted to give this place another try, but with a 75 minute wait at 7:00 on a Wednesday night I don't think it will be any time soon.  I know our wait at Bellagio last night wouldn't have been as long and the food would have been better.",1,1,0

They also had ginger crab legs (chinese side) that were DELICIOUS. It had flavor. I got a bunch of those. You need to ask the Sushi people for the Sashimi - not the highest quality, but still good. 

Fried Shrimp - yum
Lobster bisque - ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE NEW POT TO COME
Oysters
Mussells

No Lobster :(

The desserts were good. GELLATO ICE CREAM! And also macaroons! They also serve cappuccino and  coffee! BARISTA!

Best Buffet... it's worth the drive off the strip.

The food quality has been going downhill steadily, along with the quality of the help. Sure, there are still the great few employees that work here, but the increase in price (doubled since they've opened) and cut crab legs really are the points why I do not recommend this buffet anymore to visiting guests. 
The employees ignore you while you wait for something just out of reach, then help people who cut in line while you've been waiting to get their attention. 
The feel is they got popular really fast, got arrogant, and now it's being reflected in the overall dining experience.

It's easy to see why Studio B won the award for ""Best New Buffet"" in Vegas for 2010.  It's also the only ""all you can drink"" buffet in terms of wine and beer. In terms of sheer selection, Studio B has got the Bellagio and Wynn buffets beat.  The dessert bar is pure decadence, with just about every kind of beautifully decorated, delectable dessert you can imagine.  Other highlights: crab legs and prime rib (a staple).  Surprisingly, I was also a big fan of their sweet potato with marshmallows.  Areas for improvement: the oysters did not look fresh (at all), and I wasn't a huge fan of their osso bucco (though it's a dish I normally love).  Additionally, they don't have as many of the ""exotic"" meat selections as the Bellagio dinner buffet.  For the price, though, Studio B really can't be beat.

I was skeptical about going to a buffet off The Strip because I've been to two buffets on The Strip and became a major fan of those. When in Vegas, you GOTTA hit up an awesome buffet to bring out your inner glutton. I was told good things about M Resort's Studio B buffet and was persuaded into making the 20 minute trek off The Strip and giving it a shot. Unfortunately, I regret it. 

The only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because we came at 2:15pm, paid lunch price ($17), and waited until 2:30pm for the lunch buffet to be changed to the dinner buffet which basically meant I got to get my chubby little hands on the prime rib. Holla, cheap Asians in da hizzouse. Oh, and also alcohol is included in the buffet. By no means is it top shelf but hey, it'll get you smashed to the point where you'll think the food is amazing if you drink enough of it. For $17, I got my money's worth. The food was overall somewhere between mediocre and average. 

Let this be a warning to all that they only serve seafood on the weekends. I was very upset there were no crab legs but instead of trusting my group I should have done the research myself before coming here. My fault. On The Strip, the majority (if not all) buffets will serve crab legs for dinner everyday of the week.",0,5,3

All you can drink and eat, including Thomas Kemper root beer. Thomas, you make a delicious root beer float. Automatic A+ in my book when the place is serving up gourmet root beer. Try the M cider too, it was delicious!

As for the food, M had everything--seafood (Alaskan crab legs, cocktail shrimp, oysters), Chinese (awesome ginger crab legs!), Japanese (nigiri and California style), Korean (kalbi ribs which were not very good according to the boyfriend), Mediterranean and a bunch others. The prime rib was tasty and juicy and the sweet potato casserole with marshmallows was soo good my friend went back for seconds and thirds.

What really got me was the dessert bar. As a group of 6, we got basically one of everything. They have these little gourmet chocolate squares that are TO DIE FOR. They are so good, but we only got a few before they ran out so grab a bunch if you see them. We were sad to hear they weren't going to make any more :( They also had different flavored meringue cookies, chocolate mousse cakes (there was one that tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher, this was AMAZING!), flan, creme brulee, cheesecake, tiramisu, etc--all were very elegantly displayed and delicious to eat! They also have an ice cream bar at the end of the dessert section.

Mac and Cheese was bland.
Sushi tasted store bought.

When I first moved out here, I lived fairly close to the M and was told by everyone that that their buffet is a must.  I admit, I have attempted to eat at Studio B about 3 times before I finally got the opportunity back in 2011.  The first 3 times here, I was greeted with a line so long that it wasn't worth it for me.  Eventually I got in and have been eatin here at least 10 times since. Plus, I learned a trick to get to the front of the line (my secret). 

If I was rating Studio B Buffet 2 years ago, I'd give them 5 stars for presentation, price (I usually had discounts or it was free), selection, and set up.  Also keep in mind that I don't frequent buffets and never could rationalize the cost since I never get my money's worth.  You won't find too much here that you cannot find at the other strip casino buffets, but the food here is much much better.  I'm a huge fan of everything seafood here and their sushi is pretty good considering it's buffet style.  Remember, buffet style sushi equals not fresh.  Here, they tend to add a new batch every couple of minutes so you get the freshest buffet style sushi here.  

I'm not saying that Studio B Buffet is the best tasting buffet that I have had in Las Vegas.  Taste wise, my favorite is still Mandalay's.  But Studio B is my overall favorite buffet here in Las Vegas.  I have made Studio B the standard.

I'll start with the complaints I have (trivial but needing to be noted)

1- Even with a line pass (got one from the poker room) the line was still pretty long (then again it's good so it didn't surprise me)

2- The location The M is just too damn far away, if this place wasn't in the middle of no where, I'd visit more.

3- The Prime Rib was at Medium (I know people like it a little more done but come on it's prime rib it should be med-rare tops)

4- The Layout is a little odd and can bottle neck at some points

5- Kids (this is a problem I have everywhere...it's vegas leave the kids at home!!!)

Not for the good Stuff

$25 for dinner is a great price, and that includes Beer, Hard Cider, and Wine.

The Cider is really good, the beer offerings are a little weak but hey it's free, not much of a wine guy so I don't know how that was.

The View, a great spot overlooking the entire valley and the Strip.

They have an ton food, there was Asian, Italian, BBQ, Mexican, A huge salad bar, sushi, a raw bar, and lots lots more, I had 3 plates full and I don't think I had half the stuff offered.

A few of the Highlights for me

The Kielbasa is great, the Garlic Tri-Tip was excellent, The Mac and Cheese is solid, the sushi is really good for buffet sushi, and did I mention it included Beer, Wine, and Hard Cider?

Oh and don't even get me started on the Dessert Bar..OMG...I was in Fat Kid Heaven, Warm Chocolate Chip Cookies, Souffles, Tarts, Hand Scooped Ice Cream, Espresso, and a ton of other options, the dessert bar is worth the price alone.

I went during a weekend seafood brunch. This buffet is extremely good if you like seafood but not fish. I am more of a fish person which they lacked in. Only a couple of fish dishes. The 3 sushi rolls didn't contain fish too. And it had a small area for breakfast food for what they consider there brunch. Luckily the made to order omelets pleased my father and they made me over easy eggs. 

The rest was really good with a variety of Chinese dishes, salads, fruits, Italian section, soups, breads, and meats. I like the prime rib the best for entrée. And they have a section for alcohol drinks to be made where certain ones are included in the buffet price of $40 (not including taxes and tip). 

And save room for dessert. Desserts was there best section. Lots of fruity desserts, cookies, chocolates, and Gelato. 

The decor looks elegant and the staff keeps up with the cleanliness. Even though it's a buffet the servers still do a lot. I saw a few running around doing lots of drink orders and cleaning up. So they still deserve tips. Of course I always think chefs should get tips too and they usually don't. 

This buffet is apart of the M resort that is not on the strip but on the way to Vegas from the west side. Most convenient on your way coming to or leaving Vegas or passing by.

The buffet used to be cheaper, now its $29.95, but definitely still worth it. They used to have the $2 off per person who has their rewards card, but it has now been canceled. 

The line can get pretty long, since the word got out about what a great deal this place has. Just get there a bit earlier so by the time you get inside, its dinner time already. 

Even though its about 10 mins away from the strip, its definitely worth the drive out there. 

There's all you can drink of red wine, white wine, rose wine, beer and cider. There's plenty of seafood to choose from: snow crab legs, shrimp, oysters, fish, etc. They have several kinds of crab legs: cold, warm with melted butter, stir fried with ginger and onions. There is a carving station with the typical prime rib and lamb leg. 

The desserts are amazing. There's plenty of cakes, pastries and cookies to choose from. They even have a ice cream station with more than 10 flavors to choose from, and either waffle or sugar cone, or just in a cup. They even have a coffee machine where you can request coffee, cappuccino, mocha, or any other coffee-based drink. 

For a buffet, this is a pretty good deal, the quality is decent and there's plenty of variety to satisfy everyone's palette. The servers are quite quick on their feet in bringing you your requests. 

I definitely recommend this place over other seafood buffets in Vegas. The Rio seafood buffet can not even compare!! Its worth the drive, the wait and the money!!",1,0,0

I'm not really quite sure what constitute a good time frame in terms of reviewing an establishment...1 day? 1 week? 1 Month? 1 Year?  Over the year I have been to so many places and finally realized that yelp is the place to be to review all these establishments... so please do excuse me as I'm trying to catch up with many of my reviews that describes all the places that I have been in the ""recent"" past (Reasonable amount of time)  They are great memories and I would love to share them with you.

Well... here is a good memory for you!

The Studio B Buffet.  Located at the top of the hill in Henderson, LV, is a fairly new local casino.  With high praises and recommendations we were told that we ""NEED"" to be at this buffet as it's the best in Vegas.  I'm really sorry I'm not giving it a 5 star on this but I do have to admit that it's pretty tasty therefore it needs to be on my top Vegas list.

Without further delay...Let me cut to the chase and tell you WHAT IS HORRIBLE about this place!!!  Tell me... would any sane person who is starving after all day of fun in the sun \/ casino \/ Pool would wait at a buffet for 5 hours???  Well.. you are looking at one!  (Let me remind everyone that I'm never doing that again!!!  EVER!!!)  We got to the M casino early (2:30pm) because we heard that there will be a line forming and we must act fast.  By the time we got there people were already in line for dinner...at 2:30PM!!!!!  (I thought party-goers are still in bed at 2:30pm but waiting at a buffet?  Really?)  So we head to the counter thinking that we need instructions for this....To our surprise.. they asked us to take a number!  (or putting down a name of the party)
Let me tell you... once we got the name we were suppose to get back in another line and wait....What the heck???  So we decided to rotate taking turns in line while some of our party members went to have a little private moment with the one armed bandits... As our life passes us... it is now 5:30pm, Dinner Time!  We are absolutely starving and was excited to see the line finally moving.  However, now comes the name part!  The host called out names of the party listed and have them get into another line to wait their turn to get into the actual buffet.  Are you kidding me?  ANOTHER LINE???  Good thing we were called but now I see myself growing older and getting all the grey hair and long grey beard like an ancient chinese kung fu master then finally, we were in......(It's is now 7:15pm PST)  

Did I say we were in?  I really meant that we were in beyond the cashiers..... Once we got pass the cash registers, we were in the final line.....This is like American idol audition I tell ya!  gate after gate after gate!  Referring back to my kung fu theme.. how many big bosses do I have to encounter before I reach my food?  I'm getting sad now...

Finally, the flood gate opens and we were in...  (It is now 7:45pm PST) Once in, we were treated to football stadium sized TV showing celebrity chefs cooking, but ain't nobody cares as we were so hungry we sat down for 2 seconds, then all headed to the buffet to get our food...

Sad to say.. although the food is ok..Had the typical fares of prime rib, snow crab legs, chicken dishes, etc. actually nothing much else stood out for me, but they had an awesome dessert section and free wine and beer!  OH OH!  Can't forget about the GELATO!!!!!  Terrific Gelato for my tummy!  

The verdict:  The food was tasty which earned it's 4 star rating (But also including the ambiance, decor, presentation, etc.  So for all foodies who is looking for a dining experience... I'm not sure if this is the place to visit unless you like to wait...It's mostly for locals......

One last thing.. apparently the locals knows about this place.  When we went to this buffet they called and told us (the out of towners) to get in line.  The locals (about 8 of them) decided to conveniently show up at 7:30pm and ask how we were doing.... They had the nerves to ask how we were doing?  REALLY?  We were set up the whole time I tell ya!  

P.S.  For those who wrote this reviewing stating that there was no line... They either got REALLY lucky or they are just liars!!!  I'll just call the locals next time to get in line for me instead.....(Total waiting time: 5 hrs , total eating time:  1 hr)",12,5,6

Before I decided to drive all the way out to M, I thought the price of the buffet was $29.99 based off the website I visited. When I arrived the price was $39.99. Apparently the website that I visited was an old one. When I showed them the site I visited, they told me it was the wrong one and they would not honor the site I visited. 

I first spoke to the assistant mgr Ventura Morrison. She was very unprofessional and very condescending. After explaining the situation to her she explained with a rather smug tone she wouldn't do anything. When I asked to speak to another manager, very rudely and I quote she responded ""He's just gonna say the same thing that I said"" 

This response from her was very unprofessional and not manager like. She walked away and did not return for at least 10 minutes. When he finally arrived his opinion had already been swayed and he already had his mind made up on the situation based off what she told him. 


His name was Dario Escalante. When I spoke to Dario, I explained to him what happened . He told me that as a manager there was nothing he could do. He as well was very cold and not understanding at all the situation. 

The reason for the embarrassment was I had family in town. We chose this buffet because of the great reviews. As a Las Vegas local of 28 years and a F&B employee on the strip for almost 9 years , I've seen people over the years get comps for Guest Inconvenience for literally next to nothing. I did not yell or scream like the average person does to try and get their way. All I wanted was for them to meet me in the middle and try and come to a resolution. I did not ask for free food. 

I will never return to this buffet. I was treated very poorly. I've NEVER given a 1 star review for any of the other 32 places I have visited and reviewed for this site. 
I tried to do a 0 star, but it wouldn't let me. 

My next course of action is to write Corporate.",3,3,2

The dessert also good..panacatta and flan were awesome..not too much I didn't like. The sashimi salad was a little fishy but still a great place..can't wait to go again!!

Out of all the buffets I've been to in Vegas, I have to say this one is definitely the best. It definitely beats Rio, Wynn, and Paris hands down (though I am still dying to try Wicked Spoon!) 

It's best to go on Sunday's on your way home from Vegas (I refuse to eat a buffet on Friday's or Saturday's because I NEED to fit into my dresses ;P) and the wait wasn't too long for our party of 8. I think we got there around 1pm and waited about half an hour to be seated. Price was $29.99 per person and includes wine and beer. 

Truthfully, I didn't get to try out much because I filled myself up on the Asian food alone. I'm not much of a meat or seafood eater, so I gravitated towards all the carbs. Everything was pretty good from the pad thai to fried rice to chicken teriyaki and sushi! I also tried the pizza and breakfast items (eggs, waffles, pancakes) which all tasted good too. I have to say my favorite part of their buffet was definitely the dessert bar though. There was a huuuuuge variety of desserts (more than any other buffet I've been to) and all of them were sooo amazing! Huge variety of ice cream, yogurt, and sorbet as well.

This will definitely be my go-to buffet in town!",3,1,2

The flavor of the Asian short ribs was amazing, but OMG was the meat chewy !!! If they just cooked it until it fell off the bone, even a cheap cut could melt in your mouth. If I had the recipe for the flavor, I'd duplicate this with a more tender cut of beef (even ground round would be better than the chewy cuts !) I wondered as I swallowed the chewy meat, did I even break it up before it went down or did I just flatten it ? That was the only item I did not finish on my plate. I was careful about taking small portions so I could taste everything without wasting any, but I just could not bear the thought of more heavy duty chewing of tough unchewable meat.

I think we had prime rib (or was it tri-tip ?) it wasn't bad, but not as good as a good NY strip. But maybe I'm biased. We didn't come for the beef, so, overall we were very happy with this buffet. We also came mid-week, the price is better but you don't get crab legs. Since we are not big crab leg fans, we didn't want to pay the higher weekend price. If you are ambivalent about crab legs, week day price is better than weekend. Pay before lunch cut-off time and you can also get the dinner items (which might just be prime rib). I believe everything else (except prime rib) served at dinner is served at lunch too.

The ice cream was yummy. Nice and rich but not over the top. The other desserts were eye candy ! I had chocolate lava cake and a tiramisu shooter as appetizers,  made sure I could eat what I really wanted and not wait til the end when I am too stuffed to really enjoy it. Sweet that you can get coffee drinks (cappuccino, lattes) at the dessert counter.

I'm not much of a crab leg person as my friends\/family but this buffet has plenty of great options for you if that is the case! I opted for their shrimp and prime rib, (my fav) and everything else in between. You really have to pace yourself because it is impossible to try everything they have without drowning yourself, that or a heart attack, whichever comes first.

Then there are the desserts!! O...M...G.... the desserts! For someone who has a much of a sweet tooth as I do, this was indeed pure  HEAVEN. They have all your regular stuff like cheese cake, cookies,  brownies, etc. But then you move along the line and you see these cute little dessert cups nicely decorated and seemingly made just for you. Yes, you!!  There's a fruit and custard\/yogurt one, a tiramisu, one with banana... Yum. The best part is, they are small so you can sample more without wasting or feeling as bad when you grab every....single... one to try. heheh...Really, at this point there is no turning back, you may as well go FTW! Then there is also creme brulee and flan (fav), and gelato at the very end (another fav).

I've been to the buffets at Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace, Aria, Bellagio, and Mirage. I came here on a Friday.. Studio B is nothing, This buffet is more a family friendly buffet. A lot of children! I did not enjoy none of the soups there, and trust me.. I am a soup lover! The also had pho... but it tasted nothing like pho. The one at Caesar's tasted more authentic. I did like that they had oysters, but it was not clean at all, it was so gritty with sand and there was black stuff inside the oyster. 

Also, the chocolate covered strawberries was more like old strawberries with hershey syrup on top. Yuck. 

I did enjoy the Thai Tea gelato (it's in their small gelato menu), but one scoop was more like one bite, there why they give you a baby spoon to eat it lol.

The crab legs look thin and flimsy, they look like they were rejected from all the other LV buffets before coming here. Granted they were cut for you but still not impressive.

The Baked Salmon was atrocious. It was probably cooked 10 mins past. The side of the fish was dry and hard like a rock and the center tasted like canned tuna. Totally killed a delicate piece of fish. 

The deserts were also subpar the creme brûlée was watery and oily. The carrot cake was dry.

The best thing at this buffet was the gelato, vegetarian pad Thai and the fruit so that says a lot. I could understand if it was like 20 dollars but for 40 bucks you expect more.

It was the last night we had in Vegas, and amazingly we did not go to any buffets. Actually, I don't think I've been to a buffet in a REALLY long time, but boyfriend suggested we go to this one with my brother and his fiance.

I looked it up on Yelp since we weren't 100% sure where this was located, and I read the reviews and was sold. I told my brother's fiance about it and she was quite interested in it as well. 

At about 9pm (we called earlier and found out they close at 10pm), we drove out to Henderson and were a little bit worried we wouldn't make it in time to eat. We didn't think there would be such a long line, but lo and behold...there wasn't, but a line there still was. 

The cashier told us that the food would stop being served at 1030pm, which wasn't too bad since it was roughly around 930. We just needed to get our buttocks in there to begin feasting. 

My brother told us he was going to stack plates with food and create his own buffet line at our table. And he was so not kidding because that's exactly what he did lol

The buffet spot looks amazing. It's spaced out with huge TV's located near the entrance, and the all you can drink beer and wine was totally awesome. Granted I didn't take advantage of that, but the idea itself is pretty cool. The boyfriend went nuts with the root beer haha

Every dish I tasted was fresh. The shrimp cocktails, the baked mussels, the cheese tortellini; they even had chicken ADOBO! Omg, for buffet food....that was pretty damn good. chicken was so tender and so flavorful (is that a word?). The chow mein didn't taste as oily as some other places, and the sushi was pretty decent. It didn't fall apart as you were putting it into your mouth, nor was it too big that it couldn't fit into it.

I would definitely come back to this buffet place, and i hope that all the hype it may be getting from other folks doesn't cause others' expectations to become extremely high.

It was a Saturday night and even though there were not many people in line it took over an hour after we paid to be seated. That part totally sucked. Once we were seated we were all so hungry! 

We started by scoping out ALL the things! Wow! They seriously have it all! We started in the salad section and worked our way to the cheese and meat. They had some tasty Gouda cheese. Next we grabbed a bunch of all ready peeled shrimp. Good sized and yummy. The Prime Rib was probably my favorite part. It was so tender and juicy. Mmmmm I loved the sushi choices and the tempura veggies. The egg rolls were on point as well. I was thrilled to see they had my fav Kalbi ribs!! They had so many soups as well! They even had Pho! Dyanna and I picked the Lobster Bisque. Huge chunks of lobster and a creamy, spicy broth. We ended with the crab legs. Honestly, they were kinda puny and didn't have much meat. The meat that was on them was sweet and tasty. 

You can also get unlimited Champagne, wine or beer. Sweet! 
Now the dessert bar! Normally I could care less about dessert, but they had Creme brûlée! My first time having it. I loved it! 

What a great ""last meal""! I was thrilled to share it with my good friends Dyanna and her man Brent. Plus, my hubby Joel! The Studio B buffet will always hold a special piece of my heart now.",4,4,3

I thought I was tapped out until my husband showed me the dessert section. Boy did I make room quickly! The creme brulee and gelato really stood out to me.

Now, keep in mind that we didn't get here until 2ish and got our table around 3. And this was our first meal of the day. Needless to say, I was pretty freakin hungry. When we finally got in, I made note of all the good stuff: prime rib at the carving station, piles and piles of snow crab...and then I kept walking and searching..and found nothing. So that's it -- better fill up on those two if you want to get your money's worth.

The service was terrible, esp. considering we sat near the kitchen where they were bussing all the plates. We had to wave down our server for drinks, and then she disappeared on us altogether. They were gathering ppl to film a cooking show in the theatre next to us. If the audience gets to go to the buffet for free afterwards, I'd say that's worth it. Otherwise, I'm bitter we paid roughly the same amount as the other buffets on the strip.

The line although seemingly long is not the bad part...it is the 2 hour wait that is ridiculous especially when there is no need (empty tables inside).

I have the following recommendation for guests:  Please have your ENTIRE party wait in line.  Please do not have one person line up while the rest of your party waits on the casino floor; then have them rush to where you are when you get ready to pay.  This causes unnecessary pushing and confusion at the register.  

Also, if you have a party of 10; just get someone to pay for the entire transaction in one move; avoid splitting checks.  This too will make the line go a lot faster.

Please also, do not yell at the attendants...that's just rude.

It was top notch and our guests were delighted by the great quality of this buffet and the friendly service. 

A few weeks ago when our friend demanded we meet her here we said no :) then somehow she talked us into it. 

This past visit........was awful. Disclosure: husband and I are vegan now and can't stand buffets. Why we let our friend talk us into going here I'm not sure. But she was staying at the M for a work conference and we said ok why not. 

Our friend from SF and although she thought it was good, hubby and I vowed to never return. She loves very rich heavy foods and said her prime rib and chocolate desserts were some of the best she has had. We basically kept her company eating our pad thai (they said it was not fish sauce), our veggie sushi, and our selection of salads. 

The place was half empty and we waited over 30 minutes for a table.

Some of the salad selections that we had loved before...are gone.

Asking questions to the dessert area was like pulling teeth, one employee actually told me ""I don't speak English"" good lord, please grab a coworker who does please.  

Yes I can not compare this to Wynn where a vegan will get a chef tour of all the yummy selections that are marked vegan and also the request fresh prepared items that the chefs will make you, I understand that 100000% but come on, should it be that hard to ask someone if a dish has fish sauce in it?
Should it be that hard to ask if an item has milk or eggs in it?

I just really feel sorry for people with extreme allergies to foods. Wow. We have egg and milk allergies but we are not going to have an EPI pen saga if a tiny bit slips into our cooked foods. 

Just avoid this place and really most buffets in Vegas! Go spend the money on a nice fine dining dinner where you know someone will actually understand English and know the food they are serving you.

Indeed; Unlimited beer, wine, espresso and dessert are all pretty awesome!

However, the food itself was mainly just mediocre after our wait. The line moved at a decent clip for having only two cashiers available and once we were inside we were quickly seated. The first round proved to me two things;

1) Lots of salads were available, which was kind of nice as it showed an appreciation of fresh vegetables and salads that is often skipped at buffets
2) Lots of carby, simply options as de rigeur at most buffets (mashed potatoes, breads, rice, pastas, etc)

I loaded up with a slice of galbi (overly sweet and tasted of sugar, though it had a pleasant charcoal-like flavor), several cold shrimp, a slice of salmon nigiri (shrivelled and dry salmon, skipped the rice), several oyster (mostly mushy and full of ice chunks) and a spring roll (crisp but pretty average)  and a bowl of clam chowder (good, with lots of chunks of seafood but not comparable to the clam chowder at an oyster bar in florida...).  My boyfriend and our friend grabbed a piece of rib eye, then saw that there were much better rare slices out and went for those instead. The first slices they grabbed were over cooked and dry, probably having sat under the heat lamp for too long. The fresher slices had more flavor and were finished quickly. We also tried some of their crab legs, which were tasty but were skinny with little meat.

They added fresh oysters to the buffet and those were a bit better, though I had to wait for them to thaw out before I could eat them.

The dessert area was pretty nice; they have a wide selection of gelato flavors available as well as many mini desserts, cannolis (tasty) ,  creme brulees (delicious!), fruit tarts (good), cappuccinos (nice, and they come with a free shot of flavoring) and many other goodies. Definitely one of the highlights of the buffet!

The selection changes each night and the customer service is decent given how busy they are. We accidentally spilled a water and it was never replaced, nor did we ever receive additional napkins. Just minor things, but when you're sampling several different types of dishes it's nice to be able to clean your hands or palate.. 

I'd be willing to go back and see if it's worth a higher rating eventually, but it's a bit expensive for a buffet. If I'm going to go out for a seafood buffet I'll probably go to an AYCE sushi place first.

We ended up doing that and by coincidence noticed that the majority of the food was seafood. Score! However, the seafood was not the best.

I know you should never expect quality when it comes to a buffet, but I've never been let down by Vegas buffets before, namely the Bellagio and Wynn buffets. The crab legs here are so difficult to break open and they don't give you shell crackers! Due to this, I ended up with a battle-scar from a dead crustacean. FAIL. I mainly loaded up on shrimp cocktail and salad. Eh, not much to choose from. Don't eat the sushi rolls here or nigiri. The rolls taste like crap and the nigiri sushi taste like plastic. 

The only think I did enjoy here was the small assortment of desserts and the bottomless wine and beer option. I took advantage of the bottomless alcohol and drank many glasses of wine. My favorite dessert here was the chocolate souffle. Yum. Kind of sad though that the only thing I enjoyed here was the wine and souffle. Overall, cheap but the food is just blah.",0,0,0

I love Vegas buffet as much as the next person, so when I heard everyone singing praises about this place, I couldn't wait to go.

Came in on a Sunday at around 10:15 AM, no line, woo-hoo!  We were seated immediately.  We picked up some self-serve mimosas and went to work on the buffet line.  Given it was brunch, I got a breakfast-y plate to start.  The French toast and blueberry pancakes were not bad.

Moving on to plate #2, the sushi there = no good.  There was no sashimi, so I just got the whole sushi piece of raw salmon and another white fish.  I picked the meat off of them and couldn't even finish that -- it was dry and no better quality than I'd get at my local Asian buffet, ick.  The pizza was thin-crust and nothing special, either.  They did have this spicy pineapple jicama salad that was pretty good, though.

Moving on to the dessert -- I was expected to be wow-ed here, and at first I was.  The selection looked nice, but the only thing I really enjoyed from my nibblings was the oatmeal cookie and dulce de leche dessert shot.  Most of the dessert shots were not cold enough, and the cupcakes there tasted like supermarket quality.  The fruit tarts used the same crust as some of their other desserts -- it was plain, floppy, and worse than those I'd get at the supermarket.  The pies were pale, and the gelato was pretty much like regular ice cream to me.  I did really appreciate the gelato service, though.  I guess it's a good thing that I didn't *love* the dessert area, though, as typically this is where I tend to overdo it.

""Best Buffet in Vegas!""

Really, believe what you hear about this place.  It really is the best buffet in Las Vegas.  A friend told me to check it out if I loved seafood so I decided to give it a try a few Sundays ago. They've got a weekend seafood buffet for about $29.99. It's on par pricewise with the buffets near the strip so I didn't mind too much. 

When I got seated I noticed that the room was really open and has a nice ambiance to it. I believe this is one of the newer hotels so the dining area seemed very modern and new itself. It isn't stacked with variety like the Rio Buffet but what other place is, right?  

They've got a good selection of food. Not too much, not too little. What I do love about this place is the quality of the food that they have. This place is amazing as far as seafood is concerned. They've got ice stacked on three stations filled with crab legs, oysters, and shrimps. They've also got all the necessary condiments and flavoring to go with it. Melted butter with lemons go GREAT with crab legs. 

They've also got a good selection of other foods. I didn't take a tasting of their French toast as well as their Thai delicacies. 

Overall I would probably say this is the best buffet to go to in Vegas. The food quality is amazing and well worth the price.",1,0,1

First place I went to when I arrived to Vegas, since it's about 15-20 minutes away from the strip. Studio B is located inside the M Resort (nice place for an off-strip hotel) and it usually gets packed since it's a buffet. I thought we had to wait for long hours, so we gave them an hour or else we would find someplace else to eat. Thank goodness we were seated at the hour mark because I really wanted to try this place out, especially on Seafood dinner weekend! Seafood dinner costs about $32 for adult, half price for kids of certain age, and free for ages 4 and under. 

Studio B offers a wide variety of food such as sushi, Chinese, Italian, Soup and Salad bar, SEAFOOD, steak, and dessert (Gelato, Macaroons, Crepes, etc). I'm sure I forgot to mention some more, but the food was incredibly delicious. Clam chowder was so good my family went for seconds! We made our money's worth on indulging the seafood with the crab legs. Compared to other resort buffets, Studio B doesn't have pre-sliced crab legs. Instead, they give you tools and if you ask the waiter, they'll be happy to show you how to open up the crab legs because we had no idea on how to use it.

I also forgot to mention... free wine\/beer! It's a major plus for those who prefers alcohol at no cost. So make some time to try out this place, but I did warn you on the possible wait time from the crowd! I'm feeling hungry after yelping this place... :(",0,0,0

If you make it during lunchtime it's worth it and you could if you come during the time where they moved from lunch to dinner and then you and still pay the lunch time if you're lucky. I'm not 100% sure but I think that's at 2:30. Also another part of this buffet is they have unlimited beer and wine that's included in the price.

It was my 50th birthday and I wanted sushi but when I got there the only sushi I got was California roll and spicy tuna roll. $108 for four people and you think the operator would have had an accurate description. So I went to the buffet manager Dario who was absolutely useless and proceeded to tell me the operator gave me the wrong information and just walked away from me. So I called one of the operators and told her my dilemma and she wanted to put me through the buffet manager I just talked to but I told her he didn't help me at all so she told me hold on and I sat on the phone for what seemed like forever on my birthday. It was a bad situation and something I will never forget. But One additional lovely part of the night was our waiter Justin who brought me over an array of desserts on a plate with happy birthday written on it while these German people at the next table came to my table and sang happy birthday to me. The buffet manager did nothing and had horrible customer service.

I can't possibly say no to that, can you? That was the first thing on our agenda coming in to Vegas from Orange County. Traffic happened and we got delayed, let's say 3 hours delayed form our original plan. We called to inquire what time they would put away the food if we came right at 9pm which is their closing time. We were assured over the phone that we will have more than enough time as long as we get to pay before the clock strikes 9.

After holding our breaths and skipping out on stops for a bathroom break, we finally made it to Studio B just 3 minutes shy before closing. Whew! 

The place wasn't busy at all so I wonder why it took a while for them to take us to our table. Our table was finally ready but our chairs were wet and sticky. I asked for them to replace the chairs but the server assured me it was only water so she wiped it off and left it there for me to sit on. Eek!

When our server greeted us, we were assured once again to take our time with the food because they'll have it out until around 10pm. I heard him but as I was going through my rounds, I decided to get everything I wanted before sitting down to eat. I literally had 3 plates in front of me and a bowl of soup before I started digging in. 

30 minutes in and they started shutting off the lights and pulling out the dishes from the buffet. You're kidding right?! If I had listened to our server and the person who answered the phone, we would've been screwed, big time! 

The rest of our party was quite upset. We had other dishes we would've wanted more of or some to try. I didn't even get the chance to hit the dessert area. Although that one closed later, I was too busy eating my main dishes before it got cold. Unlimited beer and wine alright but guess what? I only got one glass of cider. Boo!

If we all lived in a perfect world and we got here on time, I would've been able to muster a 3.5 stars for the price and value. 

Their oxtail soup is one of the best I've had. The hot and sour soup was something I went back for while their prime rib was dry and a bit rubbery. Everything else was forgettable. Ok food + fair service + horrible experience = 2 stars. I've definitely had better!",7,6,5

Perusing through some of the older Yelp reviews about Studio B, it looks like management has taken some notice and made some user-suggested improvements.  Gone are the days of ""WTF is that?"" or ""Uhhh is that THIS sauce or THAT sauce?""  I love the way they write on the protective glass.  I think buffets that have little wedding-style name cards are tacky as hell.

Anyway, this was undoubtedly the crown jewel in this little weekender visit my bro and I had planned well in advance.  As it seems that word has indeed gotten out, the line looked hella long, so we retreated to 32 Degrees (the outstanding beer bar in the M Resort) to get a tall glasses and then head back to the line.  However, as my brother gimped away from the buffet area, a kind young worker said flirtatiously to him, ""Sir, you can bypass the line and use the VIP line for handicap.""  Niiiiice.  Alvin would now like to thank the Academy for this honor.

Despite being cut in front of by a bunch of old touristy types, and me missing out on the players club discount because I was too damn lazy to do it when we arrived, we paid, were seated, and went to town.  Crab legs (hot and cold), oysters, cocktail shrimp, sushi rolls, and sashimi virtually buried our first plates.  The oysters -- undoubtedly the true highlight of our Studio B experience -- were fresh and plump, and the sashimi had yellowtail!  We truly were in heaven.

What happened after the first plate was just a pseudo-drunken mish-mosh of food and alcohol.  We took full advantage of the wine bar -- beer was Generic Lite and PBR, if I recall correctly -- and just about every other luscious food item around.  Korean BBQ short ribs, prime rib, cedar plank baked salmon, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, black bean clams, green curry, beef satay, clam chowder -- ALL phenomenal.  I think it is crucial to mention that each and every single one of these menu items ON THEIR OWN could merit a strong review in any other non-buffet setting.  There wasn't a single item Alvin or I had that we just said ""meh"" about.  The service -- albeit occasionally slow, but homie was cool -- was very kind at every station we visited, and everything just seemed clean, clear, and distinctly organized.  One of the best parts about it, I do have to say, is since the M Resort is *sort of* out of the way for most tourists, you have your awesome mix of Vegas locals and people who REALLY REALLY want a great seafood buffet and are willing to travel outside the confines of the Rio.  So, bottom line, very slim chance of douchebaggery encounters here, thank goodness!

So you'd think after a half-season of the Deadliest Catch sitting at our table and enough alcohol lingering about to make Amy Winehouse do a double take, we were done.  NOPE!  Dessert was, for lack of a better less cliched term, mouth-gasmic.  My personal favorites were the chocolate lava cake, the creme brulee, the pecan tart, the fruit tart, the tiramisu, and the espresso bar.  Okay, wait, that's basically everything we had!  Typically my bro is not a huge dessert person, but here he was, oohing and aahing like Julia Child.  There is nothing so satisfactory and life-completing in this world than a spoonful of Studio B's chocolate lava cake accompanied by a Bailey's laden double espresso.

This place is the definition of a Smörgåsbord!  By the time I left I thought my husband would have to escort me from the buffet with a wheelbarrow.  Suffice it to say, I found plenty to eat here and all of it was delicious. 

Visited on 9-10-16 at 6PM.  The price for two adults after the military discount was like $77 but I consider that a deal since they let my 2-year-old in for free and all-you-can-drink beer, wine, and mimosas are included.

There is a huge abundance of seating and the dining room is lovely.  The buffet line is the largest of any Vegas buffet I've seen and I swear it must be about a half a mile long.  I came for the crab legs and I was not disappointed.  Their crab legs were huge and hot and already conveniently split down the middle.  I also sampled the prime rib, fresh raw oysters, sweet potato casserole, and loads of cooked veggies which were awesome. 

I had to restrain myself at the dessert station because there was about 40 selections and all of them looked like some gourmet delicious shit.  I'm trying to watch my girlish figure so I only ate like 7 desserts.  My absolute favorite was the mini chocolate lava cakes.  I wish I could eat 10 of those right now.

Desserts as always were good.  I think the cannoli are the best of any buffet in town.  I wasn't fond of the pecan pie, but the creme brulee is outstanding.

It has been 2 weeks since I have been there, yet I still think about it everyday. My friends came here during the holiday weekend, so it was $30 seafood buffet for the entire day. 

Since Studio B was one of the newer buffets, they had a lot more to offer than other renowned Vegas Buffets, ie: Bellagio buffet. I honestly thought that it was way better than Bellagio buffet. 

The highlights of the buffet were:

* Diego, our awesome waiter
* Dessert bar - there were lots of yummy desserts, like tiramisu,    
   gelato (my fav was peanut butter gelato), and they even had   
   COTTON CANDY! 
* Carving station
*Oyster bar - the oysters were pretty good
* Crab legs - it was def the highlight of my day 
* Alcohol station - this was all you can drink wine and beer. I had the 
  Berry Cider; it made my food tasted better!
* Oxtail soup
* Mediterranean station - I didn't get a chance to try, but there was 
   hummus and Baba Ghanoush

I can't wait to eat here again.",0,0,1

This review is strictly for their Saturday seafood lunch buffet ... and I suppose it is quite unfair to compare it to thee best buffet in town:  that would be the Bellagio dinner buffet in my opinion.

Having read the many positive reviews of this place, we decided to stop in on our way to the strip.  I must admit that I was quite surprised at the price being $32 for a lunch buffet, however, I was immediately informed that it was the ""seafood buffet"" and I accordingly whispered the words ""I knew that"" under my breath.

The buffet itself was nicely set up.  The unlimited beer and wine selection is certainly a unique touch that the Studio B, to my knowledge, is all alone in being able to boast.  The seafood selection was good overall ... they certainly had the regular staples that you might find in your typical seafood buffet.  However, you can truly tell that the quality and freshness of the seafood at the Studio B is far superior to it's many counterparts.  A few of the highlights included the ""much talked about"" crab legs.  These crab legs were indeed very fresh and flavorful .... I liked the fact that you had a choice of having a cold and warm version of these legs unlike most buffets.  The crab legs were also noticeably more meaty as compared to other buffets. I also enjoyed the oxtail soup that they had available ... it's certainly not everyday that you come across this particular dish at a buffet.  This dish was truly on point when it came to it's flavor and tenderness.  The fried chicken was amazingly well prepared as well ... I know ... who would've thought that I would even mention such a pedestrian dish in this review ... but what can I say ... that chicken was ""done right"".  Lastly, for dessert ... I had the gelato.  Their version can certainly hang with it's European counterparts, in my book.  It was amazingly creamy and it more than reminded me of my time spent in Italy with every bite that I took.

Like I said in the beginning, it's a bit unfair to compare the M Resort lunch buffet to Bellagio's dinner buffet ... which I deem as the best purely because of the unlimited Chilean Sea bass on their dinner menu.  I started this review with four stars ... however, after reminiscing a bit about my meal and putting things into perspective ... Studio B rightfully earned a 5 star rating.  Perhaps in time, I would get a chance to try their sea food dinner buffet and properly compare it to the rest.",5,5,5

First, the crowds. You don't have to wait three to four hours to get in (Maybe during the holidays, like thanksgiving or Christmas, the wait can be 1-2 hours. Just Call ahead and ask what the wait time is, so you're not surprised when you get there). I went on a Thursday night around dinner time (6:30), and my party of three just walked on in without a wait! Also at M, there ain't no pushy crowds there like at Bachanal. It's like the people at Bachanal haven't eaten for a few days (which may well be the case, but that's not the point), but none of the patrons there are friendly, or even passingly polite. No ""excuse me while I push in front of you to pile my plate full of crab legs"" kind of behavior (don't get me wrong, Bachanal is delicious, Just not worth it for a local to go to more than once or twice, considering the time and expense). While at M, that's the buffet where the locals go. It's calmer, more laid back, people are eating because they're legitimately hungry not trying to shove everything into their mouth to get their money's worth (ahem bachanal). 

Oops, went on a rant there. Onto the actual food review. 

The things that stood out to me at M are: 

The prime rib! That prime rib. Holy cow, thank you cow, that was good. Medium rare is the way to go. I didn't see the marbling but assume the fat was pretty even throughout bc it was so tender and juicy. 

Also unlimited beer, & wine! That was a pleasant surprise. Of course unlimited normal drinks too, like coffee, tea. Side note: their lattes aren't good. 

They had yummy & spicy Indian & Thai curries, some Filipino dinner items, your standard salad bar, American food (Mac n cheese, pizza, etc), soups. No Seafood other than oysters\/clams for dinner bc it's $10 more and only on the weekends (I think). Wide assortment of desserts, gelato, etc. It was generally very good and I was pleasantly surprised! 

Also the lay out was easier to navigate, there was an open floor plan and you could easily scout out your next move. The back of the dining section also has windows, which is pleasant too. Overall, the dining experience at M was just that - a nice meal.",3,2,5

Located from what seems about a 10 to 15 minute drive from the strip, this buffet has all the makings of the buffet that should be at the strip. One advantage that it has is a great view of the Vegas strip, although the gas station sign does get in the way. The buffet is very spacious, seating for families and parties. The weird thing is that the restrooms are outside the buffet, so if you need to take a break or do your thing you have to go out and they'll let you right back in.

This buffet has a pretty good selection of foods. The foods I really enjoyed here and recommend are the crab legs (they cut them here!), cocktail shrimp, and the sushi selection isn't too bad. I expected better from the oysters as they did not look fresh and did not taste fresh as well. The desert selection is one of the best I've seen at a buffet. They have many different flavors of gelato as well as cheesecake, tiramisu and macaroons.

Located in the M Hotel that's in the middle of nowhere (aka off the strip), Studio B has amazing food with incredible variety in an upscale Vegas buffet setting. It has everything you'd expect from an expensive buffet and more. I actually didn't expect much since the bf said he only paid $20 to have lunch here on a weekday, but maybe that's why this place blew me away.

FOOD
They have options here that I've never seen at other fancy Vegas buffets! Highlights include:
   Ox tail soup - SO YUMMY! Perfectly balanced and not salty like you'd expect! And there's plenty of ox tail meat that's just falling off the bone
   Pho - Not super authentic but you wouldn't be able to tell unless you ate pho all the time. The broth was very good and not salty like those cheap places. I liked that they had the noodles separate from the broth
   Lobster bisque - Whaaaat?! Why have I not seen lobster bisque served at any other buffet? VERY good to say the least
   Lobster Mac and cheese - WHAAAAT?? And YASSS! Delicious. That's all.
   Salad bar - They have a yummy variety of salads to choose from, and not just the typical Cesar's salad or Asian salad. I tried their sweet potato salad and it was the bomb dot com
   Crab legs - They've cut them all open for you which is really nice because a lot of buffets only have some cut and some where you have to break them open yourself. There are warm and cold options available
   Poki - There's poki here too!! Kind of hard to find since it's near the ceviche\/sauces and fried calamari but it's here! I liked the tuna poki better than the lomi lomi (salmon mix), and the fish is super fresh!
   Lions head meatballs - TBH I've hardly ever seen a restaurant serve this outside of China, even compared to Chinese restaurants in the US so I was SUPER surprised that they had this here. It's definitely not as authentic as the real kind but the fact that they even have it is amazing
   Leg of lamb - This exists in the carving section. Enough said
   Fruit salad - Super yummy! I would've eaten this the whole time but then I would've wasted my money
   Legit tempura - Yes, the tempura here is pretty legit. It's not like those gross thick kinds where you know that the chef doesn't know how to batter it right. It's like the kind you get at a legit Japanese restaurant
   Chicken adobo - They even pay homage to the Fillips!
   Kahlua pork - AND to the Hawaiians!
   Chinese BBQ pork ribs - SOO GOOD. Most places go too heavy on the sweet stuff but this is perfectly cooked with a nice balanced sauce
   All you can drink wine and beer bar --- AYCD! They don't have specific kinds that you can order, but you can ask for red wine, white wine, beers or champagne.
   All you can drink espresso and coffee bar --- Coffee is typically all of you can drink at other buffets too, but this one is specifically located at the dessert bar.
   Desserts - You can tell a lot about a buffet by their dessert selection and quality, and Studio B does not disappoint. They have a lot of variety with very good quality.

SERVICE
Sometimes the servers cleared the plates quickly and sometimes it took them a while. We came right before the dinner rush though, so I think it picked up after we started eating. Any requests we had were taken care of quickly.

AMBIANCE
Very open, clean and relaxing. Feels very similar to Bacchanal, and more spacious than Wynn. You can definitely spend a whole day here 

OVERALL
Studio B has jumped to the top of my Vegas buffet list. I'm bummed that they're not on the 24Hr Buffet Pass list because if they were, I'd be coming here every single time. Their weekday lunch and dinner prices are SO WORTH IT because of the quality of food you get. It's like paying less than $30 for dinner at the Wynn (on a weeknight). Friday Saturday and Sunday nights are a seafood buffet, and unfortunately you don't get to opt out of the seafood portion, but that makes it more expensive ($43). We waited 1.5 hours at 4pm on a Saturday for this and I would gladly make the wait again.",13,7,12

For the price and the quality\/quantity of food, this place is well worth it, although it is a bit off the strip but sure makes up for it by serving free beer and wine !  I usually make this my last stop before heading back home on the gruesome 15 hwy back home.  Cost for lunch\/brunch was $30 and the wait was about an hour. It was MLK weekend so I was expecting it. 

Warm crab legs with warm butter sauce ! Yummmm, great assortments of seafood, asian\/italian section, salad bar, prime rib, and all the fried foods as well. 

Dessert bar is also great with all the favorites. And the best part is the beer\/wine bar as well.

They were fresh and had a sweet taste to them. I made a big mess trying to crack open the shells, but it was totally worth it. My mouth is watering as a write this review. 
They offer a limited selection of all you can drink wine and beer. I definitely took advantage of this awesome deal.  The prime rib is made to perfection, just the way I like it. They offer a wide selection of entrees to choose from : Italian, American, French, Asian. There is so much to choose from, I just went with my favorites
The dessert also offers a wide selection to choose from. Some of the things were scrumptious like the creme brulee and chocolate souffle. While other things were not so good like the pistachio shooter and the crepe. Maybe I went on an off day.

While the majority of the dishes I tried were good, I especially liked the Thai food they had to offer.  I have never had decent Thai food at a buffet before, but here they had some really good pad-thai and red curry.  I actually probably ate 3 plates of just their Thai food!

You know I am always on the prowl for fine dining and when I got the word from a friend I just had to go.  Ok, so it wasn't a sexy place that ya could wine and dine your main squeeze but WTF.

Yes the new and really cool M Resort and Casino in Las Vegas .  I loved the notice outside that said they do not allow children to run like a bunch of F-ing wild maniacs through the area.  

A lot of people were in line on a Wednesday night.  That is a really good sign in my travels anyway. 

You want to pay $29.00 for dinner?  Here is exactly what I had...

3 glasses of FREE White Zinfandel Wine.  Ok, so it was from Chile...(ehhh boner move) but they were pouring it like it was an Italian wedding reception.  I like that. Other idiotic Vegas charges for a measly glass of (2008 god knows what) red wine makes this place A+ in my book. 

If you are more of a beer drinker (you party animal you) they had a limited choice on tap.  But free?  Hey the sleazy jerks I hang out with would drive there just to get their 12 brewskies for free!

Then ya wonder around this huge food buffet serving area...Yes everything... and ya think, ""ok I will try that...and that...and that...and that...and that.  Oh, I had the deep fried jalapeno!  Milk Please! 

3 glasses of milk  (BIG GLASSES OF MILK)  FREE.  Then I broke my golden rule of ""Thou shalt never ever again order fish that is anywhere beyond 100 miles of an ocean shoreline.  The Mahi Mahi was really good.  The Sea Bass excellent. It was all good.  The deserts outrageous.

Another glass of wine...Hey! Where'd ya get that steak? and on, and on, and on...

I was so stuffed and drunk off my booty I couldn't think to sit down and play the slots.  Nice big casino that seems different but  nice ...Flashy...Fun...an assortment of Bars and Eateries.  You get the idea.  I would like to stay here sometime if I could just get a good deal.

BUT......................

They pissed my honey off by making her stand in line for 50 minutes!!!  

Moral to the story? They brag that they are voted the Number One Buffet in Vegas?  Yep I would say yes, yeah they are.  Good place and ya get your 29 georgie boys worth but, get your hungry ass there at 4:00 p.m. If not?  Wear comfortable shoes!   Trust me.

7-Stars ALL-AROUND! That's right, I said it. SEVEN! Even Stevie Wonder could see this place is amazing!!! How you say? Well my Yelp friend, take 2 minutes and let me describe it to you in the most tantalizing way imaginable...

Before I divulge, let me say that I've tried the following AYCE places in LV:
-Wicked Spoon
-Buffet @ the Wynn 
-The Carnival at Rio 
-Planet Hollywood
and some other shitty places too, so you know I got all the credentials to review this place and you can take my word for what it's worth--- EVERYTHING!

For starters, it's the location. If anyone knows anything about Real Estate, it's LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! What that has to do here is the fact that it's 10-12 miles off the strip, meaning away from all that Bull Shiiii, and it has more of a calm, Kumbay fuawking Yaaaa, demeanour which is a great thing!

FOOD: The selection is ENDLESS. I went during brunch but what I saw, will astound me till this day. Seafood, chicken, fried chicken, roasted chicken, crabs, steak, prime-rib, fish, sushi, Chinese food, breakfast foods, sausage, MEAT, greens, cot damn't what more do you want! I ended up making the weirdest, most random combination plate ever. Prime-rib, tater tots, mashed potatoes, seafood, nacho cheese, Chinese food, and some other crap. On a side note, if you care there is Orange chicken here, it's just not called Orange Chicken. Instead, it's called EMPEROR MING's chicken or something like that. Do you know why it's called that? Cuz that mothafuka died cooking that shieet, so delicoius! Panda Express eat your heart out!

DESERT: Damn what more could you want? These guys have Ice-Cream\/sorbets for days! Baskin Robin's would have trouble keeping up. They also have a whole slew of pastries your inner fat-child (or literally, your fat child) can feast on. 

DRINKS: Here it is! This is what separates this place from Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. They will serve you mimosas, wine, and beer. Crazy! I'd say it's a good selection for the price. About 5 beers on tap and some wine and you're don! Just tip a little bit you cheap bastards...

FOR MY STAY SCHEMIN' folks:
Alright, if it seems pricey to you, then stop being cheap or go get a better job or something. If you really wanna do something a bum would do, this is what you do--- SNEAK IN. That's right I said it. SNEAK THE FUCK IN! I did a Jason Bourne on the layout of this thing and I noticed the bathroom is outside of the buffet. If I'm drinking a lot, I gotta use the restroom so they put it near the exit outside the buffet. The problem is, you gotta take the exit to use it and the exit to get back in. So if you sneak in through the exit you can walk around and get a platter or two but not a table! Stay Schemin' my friends.

Mass produced food sitting under heating lamps doesn't hold much appeal for me. Fortunately, Studio B is one of the few buffets where quality trumps quantity and is worth the trip.

Dinner runs about $25 Monday - Thursday, weekend seafood ups the price by about $10. Considering that an entree and a beer at restaurants like Cheesecake Factory runs about the same price, its really not a bad deal. What makes the price worth is the unlimited beer and wine available at buffet. I was surprised to see craft draft beer along with ciders, and a couple wines to pick from.

In terms of food there is something for everyone. Sushi, multiple carving stations along with plenty of vegetarian and healthier options. The desert station features enough to satisfy even the most discerning sweet tooth and gets extra points for having gelato and milkshakes. The buffet itself looks great. Modern design, comfortable seating, unobstructed views of the Vegas strip and a open kitchen ensures cleanliness.

Why might I be so tired?  I just got back from a ridiculous weekend in Vegas.  Yet, despite my exhaustion, I feel compelled to start my reviews.  So over the next few reviews, you will see a sort of travel journal.  Hope that this review turns out to be coherent.

Having arrived in Vegas on Saturday afternoon, my friends and I decided that the first course of action should be to grab some dinner.  My dear friend and facilitator, Monica D., suggested that we hit up this seafood buffet.  Being an avid fan of both seafood and eating way too much, I was more than happy to try this place out.  

First off, let me say that in most instances, I've been pretty disappointed with Vegas buffets.  The last buffet I went to was the Spice Market and I didn't even bother writing a review about that place.  Well, this certainly isn't the case with Studio B Buffet at the M Casino and Resort.  The food here was surprisingly good.  In most instances, the food was at least on par with standard restaurant fair.  Granted there are a few things that seem more buffet fair, that was definitely more of an exception than the norm.  

A few highlights from this buffet:

Oysters:  I love oysters.  While I had my fair share here at this buffet, little did I know that this would be a reoccurring theme throughout the weekend (you'll see what I mean later).  I'm pretty sure I've done my part in attempting to commit genocide against these delicious little mollusks. 

Crab legs:  Delicious.  Dipped in butter these crab legs were sweet and flavorful.  It also didn't hurt to watch my friend Craig struggle to get these things open only to end up having one explode all over the place.  Let's just say that he probably was wearing more of it than he actually ate.

Clam chowder:  Seriously, this chowder was a CHOWDA (say it Frenchy!  It's chowda!).  Thick, rich, and packed with flavor, I would be happy eating this chowder at any restaurant.  

Dessert bar:  Banana crepes? Yes please.  I love banana crepes and these were fantastic.  Almost a bananas foster atop a delicious crepe, I devoured mine and would have gone back for another if there were even an iota of space in my already food pregnant stomach.  They also have a bunch of other desserts, all of which were pretty damn good.

Beer and wine bar\/Espresso bar:  What?!?  You mean to tell me that beer and wine are included with my meal?  Yes, yes it does.  And to put things over the top they also have an espresso bar.  You can add shots of Amaretto, Bailey's, and some other things to your shot of espresso if you feel so inclined.  I know I did.  Two espresso shots with Bailey's for me please.  Ain't nothing better than mixing a stimulant and a depressant together to get your evening started right.

Anyway, by this point you probably get the point.  This buffet, while out of the way from the strip is well worth the trip.  I'll definitely be coming back.  Also, another perk -  there are a lot of really cute Asian girls here.  Go figure, little Asian girls and seafood?  Who would have thunk it?",3,3,3

She is not a fan of buffets in general, but even she couldn't help but proclaim her love for this place. I even got adventurous and tried some curries and duck. That's the good thing about buffets.

One of the things that first astonished me was the free, unlimited wine and beer. I have never been to any other buffet that offers this. 

Heading to the food line, I was surprised to see how much food there was. The food line was very long and offered everything such as American, Italian, Greek\/Mediterranean, Italian, Meats, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, etc. Most of the food I tried was excellent. Some of it was okay, but that's understandable since it would be hard to have every item out of so many to taste great. I particularly liked the several fishes I tried and also the baked salmon at the cutting station. The sashimi and salads were also great.

Last time I thought that they were just missing pita, again no pita. What am I supposed to put the hummus on? its weird. 

The raw tofu dish which is sliced tofu with a shitaki soy sauce is terrible, it is the type of dish that gives tofu a bad name. It is the only thing that stands out as bad, it is in my top 2 worst tofu dishes ever. The person who came up with that dish should be publicly humiliated for that bad idea.

The good:  the fried chicken, prime rib and lobster bisque were great.  The gelato was also very, very good.   

The bad:  the sushi was tastless and dry, the Chinese offerings seemed to be over heated, maybe warmed up too long because no one was eating it.  Eggs benedict was dry the muffin tough.

The ugly:  the snow crab is served both steamed and chilled (nice) but the crab pieces were very scrawny, a really skinny legs without much meat.  I haven't ever seen such skinny offerings ever at a buffet.

Special note: there is a selection of all you can drink alcoholic beverages(beer \/wine) but if you don't drink a lot it's a non-benefit.

We got here at 2:45 for the Champange and lobster promo. After waiting an hour and a half we finally got in. The lobster is actually a real lobster sawed  in half but tasted like it was previously frozen.  It also had a lobster breadcrumb stuffing that was good but overall i was underwhelmed by the lobster. and u had to wait in line to get 1 per trip. It was undercooked the first time but i gave them a second chance that it was cooked ok the second time.  However the lobster ravioli was sooooo good!However everything else I ate including the crab legs was awesome. They have great asian and ethnic foods. And of course the dessert and hard cider are the best... I could just have that.  So go here for the regular dinner when it's not 49.99. The service was definitely horrible... Someone near us was complaining about having to wait in line for 20 mins for a lobster and the manager seemed like he didn't care.  We also had three plates and 4 glasses on our table at one time and the waitress just walked around everywhere but to our table. I spilled the drawn butter for the crab legs and didn't get a napkin to clean it for 15-20 mins. They definitely need to beef up staff at this buffet.

My man really wanted to go to a buffet while we were in Vegas. I choose this one because it offered liquor and desserts. I understand the main dishes and sides are not going to be spectacular at any buffet, but I was still disappointed with the quality, flavor, and result of several items on the menu.

The things I really liked were the pizza (which was really thin but very tasty), the clams and mussels were delish, the macaroni and cheese was decent, the yams with marshmallows, the cheese ravioli in alfredo, and the Cesar salad was solid. 

I cannot recommend the shrimp (the shell was intact), the turkey breast, nor the mozarella in the caprese salad, 

Desserts were good for the most part. I love the fact that the desserts are small, which make me feel less guilty about eating many and decreases the amount of waste. 

DESSERTS

Creme Brulee- good, but was not warm when it was available. 

Cheesecake- very good, definitely recommend.

Tres Leches- one of the better dessert options. My man loved it and got a second helping. 

Tiramisu- the chocolate flavor was too pronounced. Pass. 

Molten Lava Cake- would not recommend. On my palate, all I could taste was bitter chocolate, it was not good (but it was warm at least).

Macaron- not good, it was orange colored but I do not know what flavor they were going for at all.

Gelato (Oreo)- had a bite of my man's and it was pretty light and tasty. I wish I saved more room to try one of their many flavors. 

DRINKS

Hard Cider (on tap)- had an interesting color (pinkish), but tasted good. It was not a traditional cider. 

OJ- tasted like Minute Maid. Pass.

Cappucino- I absolutely loved it; the foam was perfect and the taste was light and rich.

Espresso- definitely recommend this too. It was petite and strong!",1,0,1

Whenever I walk into a Vegas buffet, my single focus is to stuff my face with the most expensive items they have.  That means prime rib, crab legs, and sashimi (sushi where I discard the rice).  If they battered and fried $20 bills, I just might eat that, too.

Studio B nearly sabotaged my plans by laying out an amazing diversity of delicious but inexpensive foods.   During my face-stuffing marathon, I found myself gorging on fillers like Singapore noodles and Filipino pancit.  My mouth forgot our original mission because it was too giddy traveling the world.   Tender Italian ossobucco...""Bonjourno!""  Succulent Chinese char siu pork...""Nee how!""  Smokey Korean galbi...""Anyong haseyo!""  Our friend Canada was not properly represented, tho.

With AYCE, we've all been there:  that delayed realization on the second plate that the flavors sort of suck.  That didn't happen at Studio B.  Admittedly, as an international jetsetter, I've had way better food at an overseas gourmet buffet where they even entertained me with half-naked dancers (on the island country of Hawaii, at an event called a ""luau"")...but to be fair, Studio B should to be compared with other Vegas buffets.  So,  I rate the food 4.38 stars.

As for the service, I rate it a phenomenal 10 stars.  Why?  It was lightning fast, super-attentive, and the enthusiastic server happened to be me.

Though I strayed from eating just the high-priced items, Studio B's entrance fee was nevertheless a steal for all the wine, beer, and tasty food I consumed.  Yeah, I'm definitely coming back to eat here...this evil town still owes me money.",1,10,0

Food: 3\/5
Came here for brunch, and the wait was just not worth it.  Close to 1+hr wait (weekday), and another 5 minutes to get seated. It's like going to Disneyland, except there's no ""WoW"" to it.  Sadly... 

I don't know what has happened to their food selection, but it seems more like a glamorized Souplantation. They had a lot of salad options, and were limited with all the other food varieties.  Perhaps waiting for over an hour kind of set me off on the edge already. We were starving and were really looking forward to having brunch, but that certainly got pushed to a lunch. Ugh... got there at 10:20am...didn't get seated until 11:50am.

The meat selection all seemed to be overcooked, and drowned with very thick sauce. Salads were fresh, and of course their dessert station is still the star of the buffet.

Service: 2\/5
Completely understaffed, which is why the wait was so long. Lots of empty tables when we're waiting to be seated, but barely a handful of waiters and waitresses.  Our servers rarely came to check up on refills, had to keep calling her over to ask for water. She forgot my cranberry juice, but I decided to let it go, since I didn't want to go to the restroom during my drive back home.

Price: 4\/5
If it weren't for the 20% discount for CA residents, I would have given them 2 stars. With the discount, we paid $23 for 2 people, so that's a bargain for a Vegas Buffet. I certainly wouldn't have enjoyed paying full price for the wait and food option, though.

I'll probably give them one last chance, because I have had wonderful past experiences with them.  But if I had to wait just as long, I'll go find a restaurant instead, as with many customers who simply left the line to go elsewhere.",3,0,0

Although my first experience was after a liver crushing weekend in Vegas, I'd have to agree but with reservations.

We came on a Sunday around 4 o'clock. The line was moderately long at this point, we waited for around 30 minutes to finally get in. Price was pretty standard buffet fare at $30 something dollars. The buffet has an odd configuration, you really won't know where to start. There is a nice selection of food, definitely better than any other Vegas buffet. You can even get your drank on at the bar.

Notice how I'm pretty vague about the food? Well, to me, it's still buffet food. I'm not wild on buffet food. The crab legs aren't cut in half like they are at Wynn's either. I'd go go there for the sheer convenience of their crab legs. 

If you don't like buffet food, the M buffet probably won't magically change your stance on the subject. Come here because it offers more than other places usually do.

When I first heard about this place, so many people have told me that the best buffet in Vegas was at Studio B, located in the M Resort. Other people have also told me that Food Network had rated this as the best buffet (last time I saw the buffet episode for vegas....it said Bellagio...but oh well). After thought after thought of wanting to try this place, I then made a trip from the OC to the town of sin city. When I finally arrived here (about a 10-15 minute drive off the strip), the line was long (about an hr wait), so I thought...wow this place must be awesome. 

As I got to the front of the line (weekends are seafood night = $35 for dinner), the scenery was quite amazing, and the buffet line of food was long! My first objective was to go to the bar...unlimited all you can drink beer and wine?? WOW. So far so guud. I then began my line around the buffet line. Some items that stood out were the mashed potatoes, fried chicken, prime rib, oxtail soup, tomato basil soup, 3 cheese tortellni, and tri trip WERE ALL VERY GOOD. 

Now the reason why this place isnt a 5 star is because...
-the selection was pretty guud, with lots of variety, but I've seen better. The place seemed to lack Mexican food, Chinese Food, had lots of sushi, but very little japanese foods and BBQ foods. For example, the Mirage buffet is awesome, with so many different selections, and more food items that I, personally enjoy. They even have separate stations (seafood, salad, asian, noodle, italian, mexican, greek, etc...) Since, I am a big SOUP and NOODLE FAN...at the mirage, they had about twice as many different kinds of soups (HOT AND SOUR SOUP and TORTILLA SOUP are amazing), and they even have a NOODLE STATION (PHO, UDON, RAMEN)!! Since those are my favorite kinds of foods, Mirage is still considered one of my favorites and better than the Studio B
-and because my stomach didnt have the desire to kill itself. When Im at a buffet, I'll know when I'm at a good buffet when I eat so much that I will have to puke afterwards (yes its happened before).

Anyways, the buffet was guud, def. a spot that serves quality over quantity. AND YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THE ALL YOU CAN DRINK ALCOHOL!

They had prime rib that i can cut with a fork, which mean very very tender YUM! and they have on food channel which is a plus :)... thier asian cusine is pretty decent and the chicken noodles soup was delicious. Thier buffet can be compare to the spice market in planet hollywood but better. i don't drink but they also have  unlimited wine and beer. the dessert bar has many variety of sweets you can choose from, and next to the dessert bar there is a barista which u can have coffee with your dessert extra plus!!!

Improvements: there a two major thing that a problem. One, the buffet is very far from the strip ( for those who plans a trip  to the buffet by taxi it about 40-50 dallors from the strip). i do not think the M hotel would want to move thier hotel, but then again thats what makes M so special IT OFF THE STRIP. Second i have notice that the hotel is trying to save money, HOW? you ask...as a former sushi chef, having pre-made sushi on a sheet pan then placed on the buffet line is very disrespectful to the chefs and japanese culture. if it was sushi rolls that would be fine, but nigri sushi pre-made not cool.

Minor issues that i have is that the buffet is either to dim or too bright, my friends and i kept falling asleep while eating. also the wait is way to long, my friend and i waited almost 2 hours, if it was 1 it would have been fine becuase we had 10 people. after having been seated i have notice that there was a  lot of open tables. the service was very slow not becuase of our server but i think they were understaff ( which goes back to cutting cost).

Would i go back? YES!",0,0,1

The waitstaff I've had have been good.  Initially they have all brought drinks right away.  Sometimes they take longer to come back and check on the table but recently they've been better about it.  

The buffet here is better than many of the other local casino buffets. I feel the variety is good for any palette type.  The empty bins are replaced fairly quickly.  The desserts are also good with a big gelato selection, sugar free desserts and coffee bar.

Nothing protein related was edible.  There were a few dessert items that were okay, but this was a dud.  The hype, at least on this night, proved to be completely unwarranted.

This is the closest you'll ever get to having a buffet on the dancefloor of a Las Vegas club at 1AM on Sunday morning.  With a first impression like that, you'd expect nom nom heaven.  Sadly, several small annoyances and disappointments drop Studio B to a 3 star buffet.

Let's start with the food.  The epic selection may only be rivaled by the World Buffet at the Rio, until you look closer and realize that 30% of the buffet consists of cold pasta and salad dishes. You might be cool with that.  I was not. The remaining 70% consists of standard Las Vegas buffet staples: prime rib, sirloin, Chinese food, sushi, etc. and is the reason I go to buffets in Vegas in the first place. The prime rib and sirloin were decent, but you may want to stay away from the pasta. I almost chipped a tooth from dried out noodles embedded in my spaghetti. I shit you not.

Since Studio B is relatively new to the Las Vegas buffet scene, one of the things that seems to be overlooked is the effect of heat lamps on unlined metal serving spoons.  Be prepared to suffer burns on your hands from simply scooping food onto your plate.

The family jewels of the operation and the reason there's 100 people in line at seemingly all times of day is the all you can drink beer and wine.  At this point, you should be thinking, ""Sure the food quality is questionable, I have second degree burns from serving myself, but the beer and wine will make it all better.""  You'd be right, as long as you stick to the wine.  The beer selections on the other hand ... well, let's put it this way.  There are three selctions: Casino Brand Beer, Casino Brand Cider, and Pabst Blue Ribbon.  The Pabst Blue Ribbon tastes like an award winning microbrew compared to the other contestants.  On the other hand, if you just want a cheap way to get crunk before the club, this buffet gets automatically upgraded to 5 stars.",1,0,1

The salad station for antipasto salad and the dessert station to  get refills on alcoholic coffee drinks.

Although, if you are going on the weekends or during dinner time, expect to wait an hour or so AT LEAST! I swear, waiting in line there reminds me of waiting in line for rides at Disneyland!

Once you do get in, its hard to figure out where to start! Weekends are seafood night, so they have crab legs and other assorted seafood. On weekdays, they still have a selection of seafood such as shrimp cocktail, cedar planked salmon, sushi, etc. 

My favorites are: thai curries, poke, dolmas, prime rib, the assortment of soups, and the array of deserts!!

Ah, the seafood buffet is not the greatest, so I would rather avoid those lines and go on a weekday. I still think the seafood buffet at the Rio is waaaaaay better. The cedar planked salmon was really dry when I ate it.

You also get all you can drink beer, wine and cider. They have beers on tap, a red and a white wine, and also a sparkling cider. The cider to me, tasted like drinking a liquid perfume! Gross.

And now I understand why he was being such a hypebeast. I am legitimately giving this buffet a 5-star review SOLELY on its prime rib alone. Normally prime rib is kinda flavorless as you get closer to the center because of the way it's cooked. Well, NOT THIS ONE! I'm being 100% serious when I say this: this is THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRIME RIB I've had at ANY buffet, Vegas or non-Vegas. The prime rib is worth the price of admission on it's own ($24.99, if you were wondering).

Aside from that, they got a pretty wide range of different cuisines (Italian, Chinese, American, etc.). It's mostly standard fare from any buffet. They do have plenty of shrimp and some bomb beef oxtail soup too.

We had to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday at noon for a table for 2. Because of the included alcohol, I think people linger at tables a lot longer. 

You know, it's a buffet. There's not much unique and special. The prime rib I had from the carving area was some of the best I've had on a buffet. Nothing else was super outstanding but it was all very good. I thought the desserts were above par, but then so are most desserts at the other great buffets.

I didn't like that you had to pick up your specialty drinks like buffet items. For example, beer and wine had to be picked up from a separate counter. Lattes, espressos, etc had to be picked up from the ice cream area. I was able to get a coffee with bailey's but again, had to go get it myself. I'm not opposed to this idea completely, but each of the folks serving drinks had a place to drop tips and all our actual server did was drop water and pick up our dirty plates.

Speaking of dirty plates, ours lingered on our table a little longer than I liked. We also noticed a number of flies in the area which wasn't a pleasant feeling.

Studio B was recommended by a  local friend, so we decided to try it on our way out of town. Had I known about the unlimited alcohol, I would have come here earlier for dinner. But booze and a long drive to Los Angeles do not mix. Get that kids??

I found the lunch buffet to be a bit uneven. Some things were amazing, some so-so, some just not good. The whole buffet is organized into sections by cuisine. The roasted meats are sort of in the center. There is a little Greek section, a small Japanese section, a small Chinese section, Thai, Mexican, etc. There is a section toward the end for breads, but every serious buffet diner knows not to eat bread, right?? Bread = filler!

I'll start with the highlights. I found the entire Chinese section to be pretty good. I had braised oxtail, which was amazing, and eggplant and tofu stir fried in a sweet soy glaze, which was also very tasty. The ginered crab legs were very fresh and very tender, though not terribly gingery. The tri-tip was terrifically tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were buttery and tasty, with a few chunks of potato to let you know they were real potatoes. I tried the mango and chocolate gelati, and both were delicious.

The roast turkey breast was ok, though a bit salty. The fried chicken had nice flavor, but also too salty. The pad thai was pretty decent but a bit sweet.

The beef stroganoff was flavorless and on the tough side. The salisbury steak, though very tempting on the buffet, was also flavorless. How can you mess up ground beef patties with brown gravy?

The desserts were similarly uneven. There was a pistachio mousse with a raspberry coulis. Honestly, that combination just didn't make sense to me. The mini tiramisu was too moist with some kind of sweet coffee-like liquid. The chocolate silk pie was too salty. 

All in all, not terrible, but not great. I am told I should come back for dinner, and especially on seafood night, so maybe there will be a follow up someday. It was definitely a nice change from the usual Strip noise and melange.",1,0,0

FOOD: The Studio B Buffet offers a wide variety of food from Italian to Asian to American favorites. On weekends and occasions, they can have a great seafood selections with fresh oysters, hot crab, peeled cocktail shrimp, and lobster tail. For the American cutting board, they have turkey, chicken, lamb, sausage,  and occasionally fish. The Asian sections has sushi, stir-fry dishes, and even a create your own Pho bowl.

DRINK: You can get any of your basic fountain drinks, coffee, juice, or tea from your server. There is a bar that you can go to that has mimosas, wine, and more (don't forget to tip the bartender)!

DESSERT: Their desserts are my favorite among all the the Las Vegas buffets. The dessert section is ran by actually pastry chefs who perfect each and every dessert. They always serve different items depending on the day or occasions. They have everything from cookies to macarons to cappuccino to gelato. My favorite from the dessert bar is the Strawberry or Mango Gelato.

ATMOSPHERE: The buffet has a nice open feel to it. If you sit in the back section, there is a view of the whole Las Vegas Strip. Waiters and hosts are extremely friendly and diligent.

Their holiday dinner is 40 dollars instead of the normal 24.99 which includes ayce and drink. There is no senior discount except on Tuesdays (but you can only pay in points). This made my grandparents opt out on the buffet since they barely eat since they are in their 70s.

We arrived at 8:00pm on Wednesday night. The lady assured us that we had until 9:30 to eat which was great for us. The dining room was pretty empty but with all the food still plentiful. 

Overall the selection is great ranging from Italian, Indian, Korean to Vietnamese. There is crab legs, raw oyster bar, carving stations and a pho station. To get lobster tails you have to bring your receipt to the counter. For drinks bring your id next to the soup station. 

The sushi roll station is lacking if you enjoy authentic sushi. It basically has California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and some veggie rolls although they do have some tuna and salmon poke on the side. 

The dessert section was fun. You have a variety of ice cream to choose from and bunch of little cup desserts. I enjoyed the small warm crepe with berries as well. There is also cookies, flan , cheesecake, and some other little desserts. 

Service was wonderful, our waiter brought us refills of drinks and coffee after our meal. She was very attentive and friendly without being awkward even with the place almost empty. The staff overall was pleasant as well. 

The one star off for just in general some sections just looking... sad (how my brother described it) for 40 dollars per person despite the selection.

Another star off because of the woman's bathroom... the first time I went I realized the toilet paper holder was missing the cover and I was basically getting toilet paper from the stall next to mine and I could see inside the other stall! Then the second time I avoided the stall, but then realized the lock on the door was broken. Hmmm...

1. skipped dinner the night before,
2. skipped breakfast the morning of,
3. stopped by mickey D's for a butt load of coffee (caffeine pumps up my appetite and cravings for all foods fatty and sweet).

And all this for nothing worth remembering. Boy was I disappointed. 

The hot crab was too salty, not warm enough, and not worth the hacking and cutting into that tough exoskeleton. The international cuisines were dry, dull and lazy-looking. The meats (prime meat, turkey) looked so juicy and delectable, only to arrive bland and become monstrously wasteful on my plates.

Nothing was a favorite...maybe the free, unlimited drinks but that's about it.

I can say all this after I was starving.

Nonetheless, I gobbled up everything my eyes could devour, and had more than 5 servings of gelato, the only good thing on the dessert bar, and I am a sucker for buttery sweets (which means everything anyone could conjure up at a buffet sweets section). The gelato is worth the wait, although the wait happens because there's one person scooping the gelato as well as serving the lattes. Understaffed? Inconceivable at a time like this.

The hotel is off the strip, and since there wasn't an oyster bar, we decided to try the Studio B Buffet within the resort. The price is reasonable (unlike the Sterling Buffet) and the variety of food is just astonishing, over 200 types of food, all from different parts of the world. 

Our server, Silvia (spelling?) was simply wonderful. We didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel neglected. Every time we stepped away, we came back to a clean table. She also provided wet wipes for our snow crab-smelling fingers. Always a smile on her face, Silvia was one of the main reasons for our enjoyable meal. 

We loved the various ways the snow crabs were prepared, from iced to steamed to Chinese stir-fry. The crabs are sliced open so diners don't have to worry about spending so much energy cracking them. The roast beef was so tender and juicy, excellent with the mint julep and creamy horseradish. The bacon near the biscuits and gravy was also crispy and crunchy, one of the best bacon we have tasted. 

There is also unlimited mimosas, beer, juices and sodas. The champagne used for the mimosas must be good quality, as it tasted smooth, indulging and not choppy. Easily the reason why we had five glasses each! 

Don't get me started on the dessert section. The gelato was divine, I highly recommend the rum raisin and pistachio. Next time I must save room in my tummy to try their espresso. 

The only thing I feel probably could use down improvement would be the sushi rice. It was cold and hard in texture, fresh rice would of been tastier. Overall, highly recommend Studio B buffet. Extraordinary food selections, friendly and welcoming staff, clean restaurant with giant plasma screen TVs...all at a decent price!",8,5,6

It literally was inconsistent and that was such a disappointment. Perhaps I had the first visit excitement of food galore which instigated the 5 stars.

On a recent visit, I was disappointed in how salty the poke was, the lack of flavor in the chow mein, the dryness of meat, and I could go on. Even the desserts felt like the quality changed. 

None-the-less, I still think this buffet is a great off-the-strip location and would recommend anyone to give it a shot. I love that they have wine and a quick list of beer as part of their buffet. 

But, I have to drop them down to 4 stars. Whoop-dee-doo. Lol.

Surprisingly, all 3 of us agreed that we overall enjoyed Studio B just slightly more.    Bacchanal is $50 with the Total Rewards card or $55 without vs $40 for Studio B but Studio B includes unlimited beer and wine.   For sure, the variety of the selection at Bacchanal is far, far better, offering probably twice as many choices.  The buffet station staffing at Bacchanal is way better too.  At Studio B, there was only 1 person staffing the cappuccino and gelato station.   And there was only 1 full time person staffing the 3 separate stations for prime rib, turkey and roast lamb.  Sometimes, there would be a second person to carve but he'd disappear after helping you.  I'd be tempted to carve my own slice of turkey after waiting a minute without assistance.   Aside from the price difference and free beer and wine, the other main factor was that we liked the King Crab Legs at Studio B better than at Bacchanal.  King Crab is a main attraction when we go to a Vegas buffet so this counts for a lot.  At Bacchanal, the crab legs are more plentiful, thicker, and meatier but they are regrettably too salty.  We've had unpleasantly salty King Crab legs 3 out of 4 visits to Bacchanal.  The legs at Studio B are not nearly as thick and meaty but they actually taste like crab without overpowering saltiness.  At Studio B, we kept on going back for more crab.  At Bacchanal, we wanted to go back for more but were turned off by the saltiness and were distracted by other dishes so just passed on getting more salty King crab.   

Studio B is a 4 on its best nights.  Bacchanal is a 4 on some nights but a 5 on its best nights.",1,0,0

Service was fair. It wasn't that busy but it took 5-7 minutes to get beverages after gathering our food. Our server was OK. Plates were cleared, glasses filled.

Apparently, locals and tourists alike have been flocking to the Studio B Buffet in droves.  Why?  Because this is arguably one of the best places to stuff your face with some choice grindage and I'm tired of waiting in line behind you!

My latest visit was for lunch yesterday (although by the time I actually finish this review, it might not be).  My family got there around 11:15am and the line looked long, but we seated in about 20 minutes; not bad, but it could be a lot worse.  On weekends, though, it is crazy packed because they have seafood all day (hot and cold snow crab, oysters, peeled shrimp, prime rib, etc., etc., etc.).  

However, for a weekday lunch, there's no seafood, but there is a large variety or good eats.  Highlights: great roast pork (juicy and tender), Thai beef salad, oxtail soup, fresh fruit (the pineapple and cantaloupe were really sweet) and spicy tuna roll (too much rice, but it's pretty good for a buffet).  The deserts are good, but they've really pared the selection from where it used to be.  Mostly, I just stick to the gelatos and sorbets now.  

To go with desert, you could have a cappuccino, but, honestly, I'd skip it; it's too weak and watery (unless you like it that way).  One of the best drinks available is the rootbeer they have on tap.  Yeah, I know they've got free beer and wine, so if that's your speed, go for it. 

I have been here many times, but only now decided to write a review because I'm tired or sharing this place with hordes of people.  Don't come here!  This place is mine, mine, mine.",0,0,0

Now lemme just get the bad stuff over with....

Down sides:
- 1.5 hour wait to get inside
- Not great asian menu
- Disappointed in the prime rib

On to the good!!

The food here is great!!!  Studio B has a vast selection of foods here.  I got to have some hummus, tabouli, artichokes, diff salads, sides.  I looooved the crab legs here.  I'm not usually a fan bc I hate eating cold crab legs.  But here they have warmed crab legs which made them so much more delicious.  Like their Thai selection.  I was pleasantly surprised to have like all their thai curries!! Very good flavor. And I also loved their oxtail soup...NOM NOMZ!!!  And oddly enough, although I did not think any of their other asian dishes were worth more than a spoonful...I liked their California rolls!! Usually I don't even waste my time on CA rolls but I think that they used fresh crab so it was SUPER tasty. 

Note: I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the prime rib & the mahi mahi.  I was expecting good things from what I saw from my plate but the fish was too dry & the meat wasn't as melt-in-my-mouth tender as I'd like it.  But I guess you can't always get it right everyday.

The dessert options were TO DIE FOR.  Loved their macaroons!!  Always a fave of mine.  I also enjoyed their crepes with chocolate sauce & brownie bits.  Liked the cheesecake...and how could I forget...THEIR GELATO!!! They had about 12 flavors to choose from and I really liked their coffee flavor.  

*****this is not only an all-you-can eat..but ALL-YOU-CAN DRINK!!! Unlimited beer & wine =]  Too bad you can't get drunk bc you'll too full of food.  But the sheer fact that they have this option is great.  Plus, wine & beer is always nice when you are stuffing your face. 

Loved this place!! I'd consider it one of my Top 5 buffets!!!",1,1,1

So when my family decides to go to one, I base my review largely on selection. And there was a whole lot to choose from! You literally work up an appetite just walking around the room to get your food. 

The wait time can vary. I waited for 2 hours, but this was on Father's day. I'm not sure how long it is normally, but I hear it can get up to the 1 to 2 hours range. 
 
I think what really makes this buffet stand out from the rest though, is their all you can drink beer and wine station. I instantly thought this might not be the best family oriented buffet because of it, but i didn't see anyone abuse it. For light drinkers, I'd recommend trying the cider. For heavier drinkers, remember to save room for the rest of the buffet! 

Endless snow crab legs is fun to eat, because it makes such a mess. Maybe we're novice snow crab eaters, but when my cousin and I crack crab legs, meat flies everywhere! Don't be ashamed to bib up.

My first time here was when M first opened. Studio B was half empty, the food was nicely displayed, the design made the place feel open and spacious. It's well lit and easy to see everything. Having the counter curve into a large horseshoe shape was a very unique idea. 

Prices have increased over the years. It started at $15. for weekdays & $30 for holidays. Now it's $16 & $40 respectively. It's definitely a lot more popular now. We met locals on our most recent visit and they all agreed this is one of the best in LV. I concur. 

Prices include wine & beer, all beverages and even cappuccino. Besides the usual carving station, sushi, salads and pizza, they serve hot steamy crab legs and fresh oysters during the holidays. They always bring out a ton of each time so no worries about them running out quickly. ( like Bacchanal )

My usual go to station has kalbi ribs, though sometimes its very fatty. Also, the pad thai and the curry is actually very tasty. The dessert station serves various cookies, meringue, the usual small slices of cakes and pies and gelato. My fav is of course, coffee gelato ( when they have it ) the banana and peanut butter is worth a try also. 

The sushi is very typical of buffets and they only offered a few types each time I went. They also served sliders ( 1st time seeing that ) it was dry and a bit too well done. 

The locals also mentioned if you're a regular player there, the M mails you coupons for 2 for 1 entry to Studio B. Best to arrive before noon as the line gets long.

Here's what's wrong with Studio B:
Absurdly long lines, even with a line pass. You may see people paying within 30 minutes of getting in line, but then there's the wait for a seat. After you leave ask yourself if it was worth the 75 minutes you waited. 
The food hasn't changed in three years. There's no attempt at sourcing what's in season. Why bother with watermelon in November when you could instead replace it with another seasonal dish, even if it meant one less fresh fruit?
The sushi is bad. All of the sushi on Buffets is bad. Stop acting like its something special and get out to a place that serves sushi. 
The pizza is bad, and it's easy to cook good pizza, especially if its something you serve every night of the year for three years straight. 
There's no effort given to the espresso drinks made at the desert counter. Look at the pitcher they are steaming the milk in and the steaming wand. It's disgusting - it should be made with fresh milk and clean equipment each time. 
The bread is stale. They put out way too much and it gets stale. Period. 
Frozen crab legs and defrosted shrimp aren't anything special. They sell these in your grocers freezer and you just thaw them. Stop acting like you've died and gone to heaven and stop piling them 16"" high on your plate. You can always come back and get more. 
The plates are hot and ruin the already bad cold dishes they have. Warm lettuce? No thanks. 
Their Asian dishes have fancy names, but they aren't that good. Seriously, as you eat them, ask yourself if you'd ordered this in a restaurant if you'd ever go back to get it again.

There are a few pluses which set them apart from comparably priced buffets in LV:
Free booze. That's a nice touch. 
Easy to get really rare, bloody prime rib, which I do love. 
Decent cheese and olive selection. 
The raw oysters are a nice find on seafood night.

There are 3 main things I judge a las vegas buffet by.  Freshness of the crab legs.  Freshness of the oysters. and quality of the prime rib.

First.

Freshest Crab Legs You'll find anywhere at any Las Vegas Buffets - I was so incredibly impressed by how fresh these were.  They had both cold and hot steamed crab legs.  No salty, dingy looking, bottom of the barrel sort of crab here.  Everything comes out looking good and fresh.

Next.  Oysters.  No gigantic hormone infused looking oysters here.  No salty fish flavors. Just pure oyster flavor with a ""touch"" of the sea.  Very fresh and very delicious.

Last.  Prime Rib.  Quality was very good, cooked very perfectly.  A nice medium rare that was all the way through without the ends being dried out.

Everything else is just ""gravy"" - I never usually eat more than 1 or 2 pieces of dessert at any other buffet.  including the Wynn or Bellagio.  They are alright, but nothing spectacular.  This place has some really really good desserts to suit every taste.  I had two plates full....  AND to top it off I got a freshly made cappuccino from the barista after I was done.

The view in the back is amazing.  A nice skyline view of the vegas strip,  How many buffets have windows??  This is a very different type of hotel and a different type of buffet.  I wish it were closer to the strip.  but then again, maybe a break from the strip is what makes it so good.  They even had $5 black jack tables in the casino....

Since I was on my way out of Vegas, I didn't partake in the AYCD option, but I was very surprised that they included this in the price of the meal.  A very very good value.

The best vegas buffet hands down.",6,3,3

What i've remembered\/noticed...

Seafood dinner every night to only weekends
Whole crab legs to split crab legs. 
No more cotton candy (funny story...) 
And of course the price

The price was so good back then, and seafood dinner every night... it was probably the BEST seafood buffet in town for a good while with lines that took easily 2-3 hours EVERY night. I remember standing in that line a few times... 

But the BIGGEST change (for me anyway) is when they went from whole crab legs to split crab legs. BIG difference. Less salty. More flavor. More juicy. Less dry. I LOVED eating their crab legs back then. ESPECIALLY since M resort was the ONLY place with HOT crab legs. (at the time). And because of that, I became quite good at removing crab leg meat whole from the leg. XD (piggy skill) ... oh not to mention the unlimited beer\/cider\/wine ! LOL 

Went from going as a big group uhm.. not going to class... to where my friend and I came here quite frequently, on friday for lunch, then staying for dinner. Which became known as ""Lunner"". Lunch and Dinner ! 

We'd go around 2ish before they close the line for lunch, paying a lower price ($15 + tax\/tip), munch on different things, mainly plates and plates of crawfish (childhood skill for me from eating at Rancho's Fiesta buffet back in the day) until they start modifying the area for dinner. People usually start lining up for the hot crab and seafood at maybe around 3ish 330 back then. Now, since they changed the times around, lines started around 2pm. The lines die off pretty quick now. Used to last for a good hour. By round 2, there wasnt much of a line. 

Nice juicy prime rib available for lunch now. Seafood Buffet includes cold AND hot crab, peeled shrimp cocktail, oysters.

Is it a bit of a drive, but make it a day thing and you will have no issue here. The buffet is huge, well worth the money and includes unlimited beer, wine, cider and sometimes mimosas. Service can be iffy, sometimes they are on top of you and other times they leave you alone a little too much, however it is a buffet and you cannot expect the same service as you would at an actual restaurant.

Sundays are my favorite day to go here because you can have unlimited king crab and other seafood as well as the normal buffet.  The price is 39.99 per adult however I have never had a problem making it worth my while. One drink alone is 8-10 dollars at a normal restaurant. Have four drinks and you already paid off your cost.

The food here is not just good, it is awesome. They have everything from soups to salads, sushi to pizza, pasta to Thai food. Their mashed potatoes are also awesome. The desserts are my favorite though. Think unlimited cheesecake, Creme brûlée, tiramisu, gelato, ect ect ect. Heaven.",1,1,0

After paying and going in, the service we got at the table was nice, the server was friendly.

The buffet itself is quite long and large.  The food was pretty stale, flavorless and nothing fancy.  They had a HUGE selection of items and none were cooked with much flavor or done well.  They would do MUCH better to reduce the buffet by half and make it properly!  

The dining room was full of customers you might typically see in a buffet though who seemed to be enjoying it.  But for a ""foodie"" we didn't enjoy it too much.

Many items on the buffet were warm, not hot.  The desserts was nice though.

Last but not least, 4 Desserts always seem the same. However, Studio B which is: 

LOCATED in the M Resort on the south side of Vegas, sheds a little light for me and here is why: 

My friends and I came for the seafood brunch. The selection was pretty much what I was expecting. Your standard crab legs, variety of sushi, oysters, shrimp and so forth. They also had prime rib. I give props to the crab legs which was pretty fresh and the prime rib which was satisfactory.  I wasn't impressed with the other stuff as the quality and freshness just wasn't there. Overall, the food was okay but eating your money's worth without unbuttoning your pants wasn't a problem because it's seafood.  Here is where it gets good. 

The DRINKS that were included were different from your normal buffets. - They had beers on tap! Can you believe that? Now of course it's not self serve but I still think that's awesome. I don't quite remember the different brands of beer but I do know they had a cider flavor  which was pretty good. They serve wine as well. It was the first time I ever left a buffet buzzing. They also had a coffee station where you can order espressos and other specialty coffee drinks. Like a mini Starbucks. I didn't try it but it sure looked cool. 

The desserts were pretty standard here with your variety of bite size cakes, creme brulee's, fruit tarts and so forth. But! they got a GELATO station!  I don't remember all the flavors at the time but I do know they had around 8 to 10 different flavors. I tried the pistachio and strawberry. Both were delicious. 

The SERVICE here was standard for a buffet. We didn't run into any problems. I must say that I was impressed with the employees manning the beer, coffee and gelato stations. They were pretty quick at handling the lines. 

This place is around 3.5 for me but I will round to a 4 stars for the overall experience and value.",13,5,8

Ate here two days after Christmas so paid holiday price of $39.99 per person, including ACYD (all you can drink).  Wine and beer only.   They also offer the more expensive items such as cold\/hot crab legs, fresh oysters, lamb roast. Overall, food and alcoholic beverages tasted very average. It was thrilling exploring the selections, but after reviewing everything once, there's only 1\/3 I would actually try.  Some of the stuff just didn't look appetizing. This place is also a 15 minute drive from the strip. I would recommend paying a little more to dine at a buffet ON the strip, e.g. Wicked Spoon in Cosmopolitan, and pay for the all you can drink, which is an additional $15 on top of the buffet. My dad did that last time when we went to Vegas, also for Christmas. I think he paid $50 in total for food and aycd. Seriously, what's the point of aycd if you have to hold back on drinking b\/c you gotta worry about driving yourself back to the strip afterwards? 

So, unless you are staying at the M Resort or you have a DD, not worth coming.

Anyone who's not willing to wait at least a little bit should just leave. Because of the location prices are definitely lower for a weekend buffet than similar buffets on the strip plus this one comes with beer, cider and wine included. The place is very casual with lots of tourists and families with little kids, definitely not a date place. Service was decent with soft drinks and water being refilled regularly and dishes being taken away promptly. 

The food was very good for a Vegas buffet. Weekends are seafood and there was a LOT of it. Hot and iced crab legs (but I seemed to be the only one who enjoyed it cold), sushi which was decent but heavy on the cucumber instead of the tuna and nigiri that was definitely not top quality but was edible, very good fried cod, ceviche which was barely edible, and a really good salmon dishes. There was also a very well stocked salad bar and lots of none seafood dishes including a carving station. Since it was Chinese New Year (ish) there was also Chinese food which was just god-awful and made me very sad. Dessert was DELICIOUS because they had flan and creme brule in addition to some other pastries and small cakes (all on their own little individual plates) that I didn' bother with because of the flan and creme brulee. 

The place is very beautiful and the buffet itself is set up as one long bar that curves through the middle of the space. It makes it a little harder to reach things than in many buffets were tables are in the middle and the food is surrounding you, but it was also very attractive and I figured I could use the tiny bit of exercise considering how much I was eating. Parking was ample and free (Go Vegas!) and the casino itself smells less like smoke and desperation than other casinos. 

I would recommend this buffet to anyone in Vegas who's looking for a weekend dinner but doesn't want to spend $60, or to any lushes who want the free booze!",0,0,0

After seeing the hotel on Top Chef, I couldn't wait to step foot into this landmark (in my mind, at least).  It looked a lot smaller than it appeared on TV.  Weird.  But once you step inside, the place is gorgeous.  It's not on the strip, and you'll probably have to use some sort of transportation on wheels to get here, but it's worth it.  My family and I came here for Christmas dinner, thinking since it wasn't in the crowded area, that it would be easier to get food.  Wrong.  It was chaos everywhere for Christmas.  There were a million and a half people vying for seats in this extremely new buffet.  So many that they did a time system for people to come back and wait in line.  We got there at 6:30pm, our time slot to return to wait in line was 9:30pm.  Buffet closed at 11pm.  We had no choice but stay.

We played the penny slots until it was our time to wait in line.  My mom won like $40 and I won like, $30 on the penny slots.  Already love this place even more.

We waited in line and we finally got in.  Since it was Christmas dinner, it came with beer and wine.  You can only get one at a time, but you can get as many as you wanted, as long as you didn't feel embarrassed.

The food was fresh and hot.  Everything was well made, with high quality.  Our server was super attentive.  Everything was gorgeous in there and everything looked good to eat.  Their dessert counter was super long and they served gelato!  I love gelato.  We all stuffed ourselves with fresh king crab legs and shrimp cocktail.  I love seafood.

My family and I stopped by Studio B at the M hotel at the recommendation of some of our friends who live in the area. HOLY CRAP. THE FOOD WAS GREAT.  I'm so glad that we did. For just $40 per person we were able to enjoy their amazing seafood buffet. They offer so many types of seafood: crab legs, oysters, shrimp, etc. I really loved their prime rib. It was seriously some of the best I've had in Vegas. It  is perfectly roasted to a medium rare and super tender. I think I had 3 slabs of the stuff!

Booze is also included at Studio B. It's not the best beer and wine, but it is free :)

Seafood - cooked mussels were tooooooo cooked. Rubber. The breaded shrimp didn't look good but they were good. The cold shrimp were very good. 

American - fries chicken was very good. Actually, really good. The chicken Marsala was bad. No real flavor. Now to the prime rib. I'm not a red meat eater but even I can tell you that this was great. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes were also very good. 

Dessert - great selection. Hazelnut was amazing. Creme brûlée was fantastic. Flan was  flavorless. Carrot cake was good but dense. Eclair was nice. Pistachio was good.

Finally I was able to go because I went early. There was no line at all.

$40 (or something like that) buffet of almost nothing.

I thought that for $40 at least they would have King crab legs but nope only cheap Snow crab. Shrimp was small and undercooked. There were hardly any prepared dishes. Most dishes are combination of ingredients put together and hardly anything is cooked.
This is basically, a cheap buffet with crab legs and shrimp.
We have ton of these cheap buffets here in Los Angeles for about $12-15.

The only reason I gave it a 3 star because the deserts are better than dishes.
1 extra star for included beer and wine for those who drink.
No wonder they have long lines.

Seafood buffet at Fremont or even Orleans beats the hell out of Studio B for half the price.
For around $40 (depending on a day) I can go to Universal Studios Hilton in Los Angeles and have 10 star buffet which beats them all.

We got there a little before 10, for breakfast it was only $11.  Such a great deal!  Kids under 4 are free, that is a plus for us because we usually have to pay for my son who usually doesn't eat much or not at all. 

The breakfast section takes up maybe 1\/4 of the buffet.  It is not like other buffets where the whole buffet is breakfast there is plenty of food and they start setting up lunch pretty early in the other sections. The breakfast food is pretty standard fare but it is done well.  I like that even though they had the normal stuff they had several varieties of each, like 3 kinds of waffles, pancakes, french toast, 2 eggs bennys, reg bacon and sausage and also turkey.  The pastries were surprisingly good I usually find buffet pastries to be really dry but these were perfect.  

I was disappointed that the espresso bar and dessert station were not open for breakfast.  I mean really you advertise your custom coffees but I can't get it with breakfast?  I did get a pretty good latte and some awesome desert before we left though since they were just starting lunch.  There were a few couples sitting around us waiting for lunch to start.  Wish I had thought of that.  Seeing all the great lunch dishes def made me want to come back for lunch\/wish I hadn't eaten so much breakfast.  You really can't beat all you can drink wine and beer that is worth the price right there. The dessert station was great they have full size gourmet cupcakes; they aren't Retro but pretty darn close.  I think they come from Babycakes in the casino, they look the same.  They also have gelato and sorbet and an espresso bar all in the dessert station.  

Overall a great locals casino.  Most of the employees inside and out of the buffet went above and beyond to help us out and make us feel welcome.  Walking through the casino we had employees ask us if we needed anything or if they could help us.  I don't know if we looked lost or what but it was really nice and not annoying at all and I get annoyed really easy.

Studio B is located about 15 minutes before you get to the strip, so it has to work extra hard or offer special incentives to keep customers happy. I would come back in a heartbeat. 

Standouts: crab legs, osso bucco, pistachio mousse, blueberry scone, tiramisu, and banana gelato. 

The warm crab legs were outstanding!!! They were much better than Rio. So fresh and delicious. I fell into a crab leg dream state. Our table stopped talking for a good half hour. The only thing you could hear was the hurried ripping of crab leg and the diligent peeling of crab meat. At some point, I ended up with crab meat sprinkled in my hair. Unfortunately, W and P told me that the cold crab legs weren't as good as the warm ones. I suspect that once the warm crab legs have been sitting out for awhile, they're refrigerated and offered cold. 

Osso bucco: it melted under the weight of my fork. It was so, so good. Arrghghghgh. Initiate drool sound.

Desserts: blueberry scone had the perfect crunchy crust. The tiramisu and banana gelato was some of the best that I've ever tasted. 

Also, I really liked the ambiance. It's not a pretentious buffet like Bellagio or Wynn. It's not pretending to be something else. It's not shoving mediocre food in your face. It's cozy and friendly and warm and it doesn't mind if you take your time.",1,1,1

(The journey...skip to the bottom of the paragraph for the ""in all"")
I've never heard of this place before we came here, all we knew was that it had a lot of great street cred. It definitely knocks the Bellagio buffet out of the park, and this place seriously left me walking out of the place with a food baby (i hope i don't have to explain what that means). The funny part is that I thought I could beat the system and try anything that looked very good by getting ONE piece, the tiniest even. I started from the ""front"" (the back where the pizza was) and I remember feeling that first kick in the stomach when I reached the miniature New York Steaks. Yet, like a fool I kept going after 10 minute  intervals. Finally, I reached the end after many skipped dishes. Then came the dessert bar, that's when trouble started to rise. The dessert bar had your run of the mill Bellagio type of dessert bar with a bit of a kick, a few special little dishes here and there, then came the gelato or ""really sweet, but like, smooth, almost like, fro yo type of ice cream"" (actual description from someone behind me while standing in line to get my scoop). The gelato had some pretty good choices: Cookies and Cream, COFFEE (!!!!), Rasberry, Mint Chocolate Chip, Mango...etc.  My first try was the mango, and it was the best mango gelato ever! Later, my cousin and I did ""double scoops"" of the gelato onto a cone...we were in a hurry, so we wouldn't miss a show. It was worth it.


In all, this buffet beats all of the other buffets in the bum. Each island is filled with endless variety (from sushi to multiple types of pastas) and will surely satisfy anyone of your fellow mates.  Such a great place to go and grub right when you reach Vegas (especially if you drove your way to vegas) and definitely a great place to go after Vegas strip touring\/partying\/shopping, whatever you wild stuffs do there. Its worth every single dime! 

You know the place was worth the money when you experience a food-hangover the next morning (even throughout the day), and your appetite urges for smaller  food intake even days after *points at herself*.

           - don't forget about the steamed white rice. Can't have crab without rice.

           - topped it with cocktail sauce, lemon, Tapatio, and horseradish
4.) Gelato Bar
           - 16 creamy flavors

5.) Dessert Station
           - great selection
           - my favorite: Creme Brulee (they were delish and I ate about 10 of them)
6.) Coffee Station (hidden behind the gelato station)
           - they use real cappuccino\/espresso machines
           - cappuccinos, lattes, mochas, espressos, coffee, hot chocolate
           - they also have flavored syrups like hazelnut and caramel
           - you can ask them to add Bailey's, Sambuca, Amaretto, Kahlua for free

This place needs to work on their seating logistics. After you pay there are two lanes. The sign that says party of 5 or more right lane, less than 4, left lane. What I find interesting is many parties were 5 or more so we were all in the lane on the right which meant we were blocking the registers to pay. We waited for quite some time before we sat down. All the small parties that were waiting behind us got seated and we were still waiting. On the other side are registers for hotel guests and they were priority when it came to seating them first. Once seated we noticed there were many empty tables. 

I was amazed at their selection. Many patrons would fill their entire plate with crab legs and oysters. Not sure how fresh the food really is because the next day I felt sick, food poisoning. I don't think I will be back.",5,5,5

Dessert selection is great. They have different flavored macaroons, tiramisu, etc. To be honest I was soo full I could barely have dessert. I did manage to stuff a creme brulee down and it was good. They have the nice sugar coating on top and its creamy. 

The unlimited beer and wine is awesome. I had a mimosa, red wine, and some cider. The cider is delicious. It's pink and I think it has a hint of raspberry in it. Reminds me of Wyder Cider, although Wyder Cider is better. But its unlimited here and I'm not going to complain.",0,0,0

First off, it is reasonably priced especially if you come on a weekday. They have beer and wine included in the meal, what can be better? Furthermore, they serve Coke, which made my hubs more excited than a kid on christmas day. Apparently all the other Vegas buffets only serve Pepsi. Regardless, there was a great selection of food, and the quality was all very high. There was an eggplant and tofu thing that was by far my favorite thing there. There are plenty of veggie options which is also a breath of fresh air. 

The one thing that I didn't like (hence the -1 star) was the desserts. I was not at all impressed with what the had, and I typically go to buffets just for the desserts. The creme brulee is typically my go-to dessert and theirs had clearly not set long enough for it to solidify properly, nor was the top suger layer hardened enough. The rest of the desserts were mediocre and the gelato, although different, was merely ""okay"". I'd come back but clearly not for the desserts.",0,0,0

My Mother In Law had recently been here and spoke very highly of it, but all I wanted to do was WYNN and RIO and BELLAGIO and stuff my face at the well known good buffet's on the strip. So, on almost our last day in Vegas after doing the Wynn and the Rio and a couple other Buffet's we finally made our way the 10 miles south of the strip to the M and had their buffet. 
I had a pretty good idea that this place was going to be different as soon as we walked up...unlike the other buffets that we had been to Studio B was packed! A massive snake of people stood at the front of the entrance trying to get their beaks into the grub. When we finally made our way to the front we had to stand to the side as they were going to take a few minutes to set up a table for our large group. This gave us a chance to get started on the all you can drink beer. Four beers and five minutes later we were being seated.

Food quality in a buffet can greatly vary from barnicles scraped from a hull to wonderful...the food here was in a word: amazing. This buffet puts 99% of buffet's to shame...and it beats the Wynn. 
Prime rib - with flavor
lamb chops
game hen
king crab legs - hot and cold

1. Prime Rib- Flavorful, tender and oh so good
2. Mac and Cheese- I remember being in love with this last time and I probably went back 3 times for this.
3. Clams- my favorite of the night with a lil spicyness, but some older asian guy in front of me took about 98% of them so I had my bf on the stake out for a new batch
4. Salmon\/Tuna\/Red Snapper Nigri- I was pleasantly surprised with how fresh the salmon and red snapper was
5. California Roll- this was also a surprise, it was a generic roll with masago, but pretty delicious
6. Creme Brulee- The top could have been a lil more ""fired"" but it is mass produced, overall decent.

I remember that I had the fruit crepes the last time I was here. I was on the look out for them again, but they only had chocolate and caramel crepes at the time.

Perfectly salted, not too dry and not too soggy. And the meat was firm too. I don't think I ever had a crab leg here that fell apart before I was able to take it out of the shell. Amazing.

And you can't go wrong with the unlimited beer and wine that's included in the price. Not many choices, but it definitely gets the job done. Oh, and if you can, get the root beer from the bar. Phenomenal. Best rootbeer EVER. It was pitch black and you couldnt even see the bubbles rising to the top. It still boggles the mind how they could make a drink that tasty and carbonated without having any bubbles appear to the top.

If you like waiting in line for nearly an hour and a half to experience a mediocre buffet, this is the place for you. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but when you get in line, expect that it's really twice as long as it is because people (as many as 10) would join a single waiting person in line near the front. I wish they would have cracked down on this better and not allowed cutting. 

Let's get to the food. The sushi is NOT like you see in the pictures. More like dried out pieces of nigiri unagi with crappy California rolls, not lush-looking pieces of tuna neatly arranged on rice. Sometimes they would bring out a piece with shrimp on it but, looking at the quality of the other sushi pieces, I opted to stay away.

The prime rib and the crab were good, but you can get that at any buffet on the strip. The sides were mediocre, except for the sweet potatoes with bruleed marshmallows on top. Tried a BBQ rib, but it was really tough and dried out. May as well have been microwaved and slathered with sauce.

The tarts had a mixture of canned and fresh fruit on them. Who wants a tart with a piece of canned pineapple and a canned peach? No thanks.

plenty of food, ranging from mediocre cocktail shrimps, ""hope i don't get food poisoning"" sushi, alright ny steak, alright lamb, wide variety but everything else was not worth of mentioning. They do have a yummy gelato station.

The desserts are the best thing ever!! Free beer and wine included w Buffett pricing. They always have carved meats, soup, salads, pizza, Chinese, sushi, American and so much more. 
I would guess it's the 2nd biggest Buffett (I believe the Rio has the largest one) but nothing here has ever been bad or basic. Even something like mac and cheese is amazing. They have the best mushroom soup and even a pho station. If you ask the chiefs for anything they will accommodate your request if they are capable. Smoothies are made and ready for you to have w your meal. Drinks are included and I have NEVER had a bad service.

Go with your instict to stop over at the M Casino and Resort before taking off...  Your last grand buffet before going back to regular boring life style.. Stop off for your last grand buffet at Studio B! You'll thank me later! (Or hate me)

Got to admit it, pretty good buffet! What blew my mind away was not the food, but yet the dessert bar! How could there be such delicious all you can eat dessert bar??

 I am devastated they ended the senior deal so my folks didn't get their discount. We paid  about $35 per person. One of the best part to not give up on this was there was a line for their VIPs and Handicap and another line for everyone else. Well, keep in mind if anyone in your party is in a wheel chair or an elderly, you can get into the handicap line and get in without much waiting! 

My family is really not a big fan about buffets only because are eyes are way bigger then our stomach and we feel like crap afterward! BUT... who can resist missing one of the best Buffet in Las Vegas. I kind of forced everyone for a final stop and forced to have lunch at Studio B before heading to LA.

The food was impeccable. Prime rib and King crab legs, I just stuffed my face with these two items! haha. Fresh and delicious.cusines, from Chinese cuisine to Mexican, American, French! The list keeps going!

Oh my Gawd! The dessert section is like heaven. And usually at buffets the desserts doesn't taste so good, their either too sweet or not sweet enough, but this place is amazing! All different kind of cupcakes, from Red velvet, chocolate to peanut butter.Creme Brule, to all kind of cakes, macaroons, the best a full gelato bar!I had a pistachio nut gelato and a cappuccino (Yes even a cappuccino bar) to end my meal!!

I am not a drinker so I did not have any booze but let me tell you that I was still thrilled with the place. 

I try to stay away from the strip due to all the rude workers at the strip.  Some people are nice but there is so much cattle traveling through those places on the strip that some people naturally feel that they can lie and be rude to you.  That was my experience at Pampas on the strip.  After that experience I was a bit gun shy about another buffet.  My father took me to Studio B at M resort.

Lets put it this way, my father is a local and likes to go to the local places in Vegas because the crowds are smaller and the people are nicer.  I am not a local but after dining at Studio B I asked if there were any homes for sale within walking distance to this restaurant.  

My favorite buffet has always been Fugo De Chao but there is a new kid on the block!
This place is unbelievable.  Good thing I brought some digestive enzyme pills with me because the food was so great that I polished off 4 plates, 2 coffee drinks and many desserts.  I am not a big dessert guy but the quality of their food was so incredible I just had to keep going back for more. 

This place is awesome.  It feels like you are entering an airport when you go back for food.  The place is so huge and they have so many selections it is nothing short of amazing.   One of the other reviewers said that they also have a breakfast buffet.  I will definitely want to try that next time, especially if it is only $10.99 as he said. 

The only problem I can see that would have ruined the experience is that others have found out about this place and the lines can be long to get in.  Try to get there ahead of the crowd.  Do NOT rush yourself.  Take it all in and spend hours there enjoying it.  The food is worth the $39 which by the way also includes the tip so in reality it is only about $34 unless you are deadbeat that never tips.",0,1,0

The food did not disappoint. As always, I tried to have a little of everything and was pleasantly surprised to find Pancit on the menu! For those that don't know, Pancit is a Filipino noodle dish often served at parties or large get togethers. I generally make a rule to not eat Pancit unless it's home-cooked, but I took a chance with Studio B. Verdict? Not as good as my mother's, but definitely better than any I've had from Filipino restaurants!

My favorite dishes were:
1.Oxtail soup - The oxtail meat fell off the bone, and the soup was really good.

2. Crab legs - The crabs was cooked perfectly, and it was easy to take out the meat with the red stick thingy.

Yes, that is the song I feel like singing to my food at the Studio B Buffet!

29.99 for all you can eat seafood and other tasty entrees such as pad thai, roast beef, sushi, pasta and many many others! 

I started off with the crab legs. SO WORTH THE MONEY. I didn't care for the butter dips.. Try getting a bunch of lemon, squeezing it into your sauce cup and sprinkle pepper and salt. THAT'S HOW TO DO IT!! Drool! I tried the other food which was pretty good but I kinda wished that I just stuck to eating crab legs.

Oh did I mention, AYCE and DRINK beer and wine. The cider was damn tasty. A bit too bubbly but tasty! 

The dessert buffet had gorgeous looking treats. My favorites: the chocolate rice crispies (think rice crispy lightly coated with dark chocolate) and the creme brulee.

--Tomato basil soup
--Buckwheat noodle salad
--Prime rib (with creamy horseradish & au jus!)
--Warm snow crab legs with butter
--Tuna & salmon sashimi...sooo fresh
--Shrimp cocktail (always a buffet staple for me)
--Mashed sweet potatoes
--Creme brulee (heaaaaven!)
--Tiramisu
--Mango, strawberry & raspberry sorbeto

To be honest, it felt like there were a couple of misses. The clam chowder was salty, the pad thai was lacking (my cousin who's been to this buffet numerous times says that it can range from amazing to ehhhh depending on who makes it in the kitchen), the bread pudding was a bit dry, and the MERINGUES were wrongly labeled as MACARONS! Don't be fooled!

Of course, I also wish there was a bit more variety in the beer & wine offered. My cousin asked if they served Sauvignon Blanc to which the lady behind the bar answered, ""I'm sorry, we don't serve cocktails"". When my cousin repeated her question, the lady told her ""We only have wine here"". HAHAHA yes, we experienced a bit of awkward communication there and to answer my cousin's question, no they did NOT offer it. I was looking forward to a mimosa but sadly, they also didn't offer any champagne :(

I love how it's less crowded than the buffets found on the strip & the quality of most of their items are top notch.

and WOW. this is by far the best buffet that's out there. 

Pros:
- Cheap for lunch 
- the seafood buffet on the weekends is AMAZING. the crabs, shrimps, oysters are very fresh. a bit pricey though ($40) 
- the dessert section is huuuge! some of the things can be on the sweeter side but my favorite is the panna cotta and the creme brule. you can tell the dessert is great when there's a line inside the buffet to get to it!
- the meat selection is large and the short ribs are the die for. The prime rib is also great! tender and juicy.
- The salad section has a lot of variety. also very fresh
- best sweet mash potatoes i've ever had. the marshmallows baked on top is delicious
- Unlimited beer and wine! 

Cons: 
- the hotel itself is very far from the strip. It takes us about 15-20 min by car. I would imagine the taxi ride there would be pricey as well.
- the asian food is not very good. The sushi was dry and the chow mein was over cooked. The Pad Thai was also fluorescent orange and too sweet.  (the only food I loved in the asian section was the Thai Curry)

I will quickly highlight points to save all you curious people time.

A lot of the food were SALTY: lambs, orange chicken, fish.

Salmon was dried, sushi so plain, crab meat very empty, oyster was not fresh.

The service was terrible, the waitress mixed my party drinks with another party.

I honestly feel like the restaurant is having an issue with their main chefs because there's a reason why they have 4 stars ratings from before.

Went on a Saturday around 5:30p since we didn't want to wait, and yes, we did drive out of Vegas for about 20 minutes just for the buffet.  Studio B is located inside the modern M resort, and is probably the biggest draw of the hotel.

Once we paid and were seated, I immediately went for the carving stations.  Prime rib, BBQ ribs, lamb, turkey, roasted chicken... everything was there.  Of course, I started out with the prime rib because for me, the quality of the prime rib can sometimes make\/break a buffet.  Surprisingly, M Resort had one of the best prime rib I've had a buffet, anywhere!  The seasonings on the crust, the medium-rare doneness, and the au jus all came together for a delicious tasting prime rib.  The braised short rib was my 2nd favorite.  Didn't expect the buffet to have tender short ribs.  

A lot of people liked the BBQ ribs, including me, but I do have to say, it is a bit fatty so that may turn some people away.  The poultry were all good, but for some reason they didn't have chicken breast, only the dark meat.  Not that I was really complaining since I always prefer the more juicy part of the bird.

As for the seafood, that's what all others went for first.  The highlight is definitely the crab leg!  Mounds and mounds of crab legs.  It's not split in half for you like some of the buffets at the high end hotels (Wynn, Bellagio), but it is cracked open at strategic spots so it is quite easy to crack the legs.  However, one thing I do have to say that it was extremely salty and that some just looked sorta odd with brown and green spots.

There's also unlimited raw oysters!  A few of my friends totally went berserk but I sorta held back since I've had bad experience with raw oysters and will only eat the ones that has a pure clear liquid, but that's just me.  The fact that they offer raw oysters is amazing to me though.

There's also an Asian section, which is the same as everywhere else.  Hot foods such as mashed potatoes and fried fish is there as well.  My favorite was definitely the fried calamari with marinara sauce.  It's like free and unlimited appetizer that you would have to pay 10-12 bucks for at any restaurant!

As for the desserts... I didn't care much for the cakes but they do have creme brulee (I'm a sucker for it) and gelato ice cream!  Creme brulee is creamy and tasty.  For the gelato, lemon was definitely my favorite.  Sweet but just enough tang for you to pucker.  

Another huge draw for the buffet is the unlimited beer & wine.  3 types of beers on draft and a red\/white wine option.  It's sorta hidden in the corner and a lot of people thought you had to pay but it's just people giving tip.

Seriously, I have a craving to go back.  It may not be the best quality and it is a little out of the way, the price, selection, and unlimited alcohol definitely pushed this buffet into the 5 star realm!",3,1,4

Hawaii family was in town and wanted to try something new.
I've always heard about this buffet but, hearing that they had oysters on the menu sealed the deal.

We arrived to an hour long wait. Which is to be expected on a Saturday night. Thankfully the bar was near by so, we had a few drinks to entertain us in line. Drinks were cheap, too =) You don't even know how shocked I was at paying $15 for 3 drinks.

Once we got inside, I headed straight for the oysters. Ugh, SOOO GOOD!
And next to the oysters was OXTAIL and KALUA PIG AND CABBAGE.
I have never been to a buffet that has any of those. I was, literally, blown away.

Their dessert menu is, by far, bigger and better than Wicked Spoon. And we alllll know how much iiiiiiiiiiiiiii love Wicked Spoon. It was levels on levels of desserts AND they, also, had dessert and coffee drinks made to order. IN-SANE.


By the time, I ate my way through the buffet line was when I realized that WINE AND BEER WAS AYCE (AYCD), too. Sadly, I was too stuffed to drink anything.

However, the cashiers were so nice and gave everyone in line breakfast buffet pricing!  They apologized for the long wait due to the fact only two registers were open.

First, this resort is located off strip so even if we knew the line would be long, we didn't really have a choice to waste another $30 in cab fare to get back to the strip without being fed.  I actually don't mind waiting for my food and actually get even more excited because when there's a line because it usually means there's a huge payoff in the end.  As the buffet's closing time was coming near, I just assumed that since nobody was cutting the line off it meant that those who were able to get into the buffet before closing time would still have their fair share of freshly cooked food.  However, when we finally got in (2.5 hours later), it was about 15 minutes to closing and the cooks were already closing up.  This meant no fresh food and the food that was left out looked like it was already attacked by a ravenous hoard (which probably isn't that far from the truth!).  The service was friendly and they made sure to assure us that we didn't need to hurry, but that did little to assuage our anxiety of the fast disappearing food!  Positives include the free wine and good micro brewed beer.  I also really liked the Korean-style short ribs, mahi mahi, and delicious chocolate soufflé.  The price for the M Resort dinner buffet wasn't that impressive; at $30 per person, I would have rather paid the extra $5 to eat at the Wynn buffet again.  The desserts were ok, but again I was disappointed that the servers behind the dessert bar wouldn't bring out more desserts (my cousins missed out on the flan).

There's an entire Asian-inspired section which I thought was neat, but didn't try anything but the kalbi short ribs(which were yummy but too saucy). I enjoyed their prime rib, although it wasn't the best of Vegas. Cocktail shrimp was a bit small; Bellagio's buffet has cocktail shrimp nearly twice the size.

The unlimited alcohol bar was pretty cool. Lots of people getting wine and beer. Personally, I went for the root beer on tap. Delicious!

1) The seafood alone makes it worth it. All you can eat crab legs, osyters on the half shell, shrimp cocktail, mussels, crawfish. IN ADDITION TO all the food you can find at a normal vegas buffet, including a pretty good sushi selection and sashimi salads. 

2) the crab is already cut in half for you so the most annoying part of eating crab is no longer an issue. 

3) on the same note, the shrimp is also peeled for you. Equally amazing. Might I recommend using a soup bowl to hold the cocktail sauce? 

4) Beer and wine included in the price. The house cider is delicious! 

5) Pretty good dessert including crembrulee and gelato. Although I would like to argue that the gelato is more like ice cream

One of the better buffets in Vegas.  So worth the money, $16 for lunch on weekdays?  Down.

Note that on the weekend, they offer a seafood buffet that is priced at ~$40 for both brunch and dinner.  I came here one Saturday for the buffet, but skipped over to Hash House A Go Go next door after finding out it was seafood buffet and having a friend allergic to anything and everything seafood.

The weekday lunch buffet was my first official stop of my 21st birthday extravaganza though I was still 20 at the time.  I'm so glad I was able to experience an inexpensive but very satisfying meal.

With me at buffets, I'm not looking for variety per se, just so long as what you offer delivers.  Studio B Buffet does just that, as it delivers with both variety and taste.

Their seafood selection for lunch is pretty impressive since a lot of other places don't have many options for seafood unless it's dinner time.

The cider is good, too.  Man, open bar?  You got me, Studio B.

I was disappointed this time around. I was here with my husband and 8 yr old kid.  When paying for our meals upfront, I told the cashier we have 3 people, she rudely asked if it's for 3 adults... I guess the obviously short 8 yr old minion that is with us looked like an adult. SMH.  After we were seated and got food, the quality of selection seem to have dropped from last year. It seemed more simplified, nothing fancy.  Our waitress (plate cleaner more like it) was also oblivious to my hand sawing the prime rib I got with a dull knife, after she had stopped by 3 times and I was already almost done with my prime rib I finally gave up asked if there were steak knifes and she said ""yea"".  Eh, after seeing my husband and I both having prime rib on our plates, wouldn't the first visit to our table ring a light bulb to get us steak knives anyways!?!  

Food quality has gone down, the selection of unique food seems to be less.  I did not see some of the other dishes that they had 9 months ago.  For $115 for the 3 of us and the experience was very disappointing.  For that price I'd rather just go to a steak house and have better food.  This time around, I was not impress, especially with the prices up, I would expect my experience this time around to be at least the same and was not.  Don't think I would come back again.",1,1,0

Went there for ""brunch"" on a Sunday morning at 11. Granted, it is called a ""seafood brunch"" so you'd expect the usual suspects of spindly crab legs that are scooped up the second they're put out and the oysters on the shell that no one ever eats  (pretty sure they're safe just buying fake ones and trotting them out every day), and in that aspect there was no disappointment.

Problem was, I came here expecting BRUNCH. And what exactly is brunch, kids? A blend of breakfast and lunch, you say? I thought so, too! But after a late Saturday night, this was a loooong drive across town to roll in and discover that they had not one breakfast item! I kid you not- not an egg, not a slice of bacon, no form of breakfast potatoes, muffins, danish - anything that could pass for breakfast.  The closest thing they had was a huge coiled intestine of some kind of sausage that did not look appetizing in the least.  I found some dried up biscuits but somehow they're not the same with brown gravy. And they did have some little crepe things on the dessert line (I was trying here, fellas), but they crumbled strangely under the fork and had to be made of what I can only assume was wallpaper paste. Yuck. Poo.  How do you advertise brunch and not throw out so much as a pan of scrambled eggs? 

This was a long and winding road of silver dishes filled with absolutely nothing I wanted to eat. (Family members did timidly announce that the prime rib was ok, but knew better than to press the issue.) So if you don't feel like chow mein and lasagna for breakfast, you're basically spending like like $40 for a cup of coffee.

Might as well just go to Starbucks.",1,2,1

I believe they only offer the seafood dinner on the weekends. And the wait is kinda insane - it wasn't moving a lot even though we could see plenty of empty tables. I think we waited an hour even though we got there kinda early at 5. And wow, at $40, you better come here if you can eat and love seafood and can get your money's worth.

You can get your free alcohol in the corner at a makeshift bar. They do check your ID so don't forget your wallet at the table. I'm not a big wine or beer fan but luckily they had hard cider which I found tasty and refreshing. Must haves are the crab legs, shrimp and oysters. I also enjoyed their soups - lobster bisque and clam chowder. While their beef\/tri tip\/prime rib is delicious, nothing else really stood out to me. Gotto stick to the seafood anyways to get the most bang for your buck. Desserts were pretty awesome too. I had the crème brulee and molten chocolate cake and a cupcake and of course, ice cream. Mmm.

Decent selection of desserts. There's macarons, gelato & chocolate covered strawberries but my favorite was the flan!

One of the best dishes we had there was the lamb they had.  There was no gamey smell or taste, and was not tough or chewy.  One of the best pieces of lamb we ate before!  Their lava cake was also super yummy!  Although it didn't look as attractive as some of the other desserts, the first bite was heavenly!

Now for the hubby's turn:
Looking for the best buffet Las Vegas has to offer? However, you won't find it on the strip. A few miles down from the strip is this buffet who created such acclaim for it's revolutionary menu, that other more renown buffets like at the Bellagio, Caesar's, and Wynn had to revamp what they offer!

I agree with the wife's opinion about the food, but what she missed was that this buffet's layout of their offerings are structured in a way that it's easy to remember where each entrée is. After exploring both wings of food, the middle is where you should concentrate on. Lamb, prime rib, ham shanks, beef tenderloin, and broiled fish were offered when I went there on New Year's Eve; my birthday!

Another thing to notice was the ambience of the place. Nothing too fancy nor a theme, but I hear this buffet presents a theme every month or so. The service was better than expected. Not usual idle service as in most other buffets. The waiters we had were specifically observant. Whenever I raised my hand for a refill of the Coke I was drinking, they came with a new glass without me asking for another. 

I would have given this place 4.5 stars, but I'll settle for the wife's 4 star rating. Most likely, it was due to her disappointment from the lack of desserts, but I'm not s dessert guy. However, the magic words must be ever ready to say, ""Yes dear"", as I finish this review and succumb to her 4 star rating. Happy yelping everyone!",0,1,0

But in in terms of value this is the best place for your buck.  Studio B offers complimentary beer and wine unlike the other buffets in LV, but the only drawback of this buffet is that you need a car or you need to pay a hefty taxi fee to get to The M Resort, the location of Studio B.  It's a hike from the strip, which is why I only see SoCal peeps, local peeps, and high rollers staying in the hotel or gambling in the casino.

Studio B is phenomenal.  The quality of the food is pretty darn good for a buffet.  I like the fact they have oxtail, crawfish, and crabs (on seafood night), and other high quality dishes.  My only recommendation would be to stay clear of this buffet during the holidays.  We waited 3 hours in line to get in this past Christmas.  Unfortunately, for us, our line pass was good for January only...darn!  Other than holidays the lines aren't really that bad compared to the other buffets in The Strip.

It's the second best buffet after Bellagio, all things considered.  It's  $30 buffet on weekends (I believe Bellagio's is $35).  The food is good.  The seafood is for the most part fresh.  But the service is hit or  miss.

+The shrimp cocktail is always the first thing I go for at buffets.  It was a good way to start this buffet as well.  Peeled for you and cooked perfectly.  Nice and succulent.  The cocktail sauce was great, not weaksauce like other buffets.

+Oysters!  At a buffet!  These were hit or miss, but if you choose out the fresh ones, you'll be fine.  You hafta ask for Tabasco, and I do prefer limes but lemons work fine.  AYCE oysters... drooooooool...

+Crab legs.  These weren't really precracked like Bellagio, but no problem.  My brother dominated these.  They were good.  Very sweet.

+Prime rib.  Most buffets I swear have prime rib, but I swear they are not Prime rib, but just a ribeye roast.  This, was definitely prime rib.  Beefy, tender, delicious.  Great Au Jus to go with it.

+Osso Buco... I think this is the best I've ever had.  They even had piece that had marrow left in it!!!!!!  I was so excited!  I think my cholesterol shot up after dominating these things.

+ Cappuccino and the server who hooked it up with the Baileys! 

-Dessert bar.  It was a decent bar, but I was expecting a bit more.

-Quality of wine.  I guess the wine's quality is above two buck chuck.  Nothing great here.  But it's free (besides the $1 tip).

The variety didn't seem as good as Bellagio's still.  Nothing wow'd me.  Last time I went to Bellagio they had Ostrich!  This has pretty standard buffet foods --- just a better quality.

And like I said, service is hit or miss.  We had two servers and the guy was really good.  The other lady.. sucked.  Badly.  I like to tip more for buffets as they're always running around waiting on us.  But for this occasion, 17% was all they got.  I wish I could just give it to the dude, then I'd tip him 25%  But that lady was so horrible.  We asked for a lot of things but didn't get it, had to ask the guy 10 minutes later.  She took 30 minutes to get someone a coke and when she dropped it off said ""oh it looks like you got him to get it for you already.""  No shit, bitch!  Took you 30 minutes to get us a coke?

Anyway, for being off the strip with all the hype it's getting I guess I was expecting a bit more.  For $30 it is cheaper than Bellagio, but certain things just wasn't enough to make it my favorite.  Next time, I'm hitting up Bellagio again!

Last I visisted it was in July\/2010 when Adam Lambert held a concert in the Manadalay Bay Hotel.....well, my friends and I decided to go to M Resort for the weekend Seafood Buffet.  Although it was $29.99, the quality of food was excellent.  There's no complaint about pricing because of that from me or my friends.  The second time I went----which was just two days ago, Wed. before Thanksgiving, my friends and I tried the $10.80 breakfast buffet....it was also excellent.  We had arrived slightly too late to enjoy a second breakfast plate, but it turned into lunch buffet.....so, we had the chance to try weekday regular lunch there.  The food selections were widely varied, and the dessert bar remained amazing as usual.  I was just surprised I couldn't find Creme Brulee.....that was the only item missing when I went for the breakfast buffet (that turned into lunch) this 2nd time I went.

it's a little bit of a drive from the strip...like 15-20 minutes...but well worth the time and money.  oh btw, the buffet here is cheaper than most hotels on the strip...but don't let the price fool you!  the variety is monstrous...the place is super fancy...and the food is so UNFORGETTABLE!  

i was feeling a little sick when our buddies arrived in vegas and took us to this magnificent buffet...so i didn't get to indulge like i would've wanted.  but seeing the 3 peeps in my party get up and down back and forth with new plates every few minutes was enough to prove that this buffet rocks!  the pizza was delish...the carved meats were yummy...sushi, assorted asian food, seafood...oh, and get this, beer and wine are included!!!  

the dessert bar was greeeeeat!  i loved the crepes...just good ole plain crepes were what i preferred...and a couple of scoops of gelato.  they have a huge variety of macaroons...and assorted desserts.  

the service was phenomenal!  our plates were gone in a sec and drinks were refilled in a very timely manner.

Seriously, their buffet is like a mile long winding snake and everything looks so good, that my plate inevitably gets filled up and then I see more stuff that I want to try. Yes, there are mountains of crab legs, but there is also sushi, prime rib, pad thai and curry, hummus, pizza, pasta, Chinese food, fried chicken... and that's only about 10% of the stuff they offer. A HUGE and delicious selection. I had 3 platefuls, and this is not including soup, or dessert, or drinks.

Yes, drinks. Beer and wine is included. I saw some complaints about the small cups and how you can only get 1 tiny drink at a time, but this was not the case for us. The pours were all decent sized, maybe about a half pint glass for beer? And they let you get 2 drinks at a time. In fact, they would ask if you wanted beer with your wine lol. I had the cider which I think was a raspberry cider and it was really good! In addition they have an M beer (a German-style lager, I was told), Coors light, PBR and root beer. And of course your wines.

If booze isn't your thing, they also make espresso drinks at the dessert station! I think they might even be able to booze those up for you because I saw bottles of amaretto next to the vanilla syrup. Speaking of desserts, I think I ate 4. I meant to only take a bite of each, but I couldn't stop myself. Oof, no wonder I had to roll myself out of there.

We arrived around 4:45 and people were already in line. We only had to wait about 20 minutes, but still my heart sank a teeny bit when I saw a line. I also made sure to get a player's club card, but was told there is no discount. Maybe because it was Labor Day? I also read a few reviews which mentioned getting a ""Fast Pass"" or sorts to come back at a later time, but I don't believe this is the case any longer and you just need to get in line.  

With that said, it's totally worth the drive off the strip to come here. Totally worth the $30. I'm sitting by my phone now waiting for the M to call me and tell me I won the free buffet for life.",0,0,0

Their Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque soups are fantastic.

Highlights: FREE beer and wine!!!  Espresso bar with LIQUOR!!!  Amazing crab legs, clams, kalbi, clam chowder, fried chicken, and well bascially everything was delicious.

  I arrived in line on a Monday at 12:36PM.  At 1:38PM, I finally made it to the cash register to pay.   I was solo, but had a ""2 for 1"" coupon.  The cashier immediately told me that I couldn't use the coupon because I was solo.    Plenty of other buffets in the area (Station Casinos, Silverton, et al) also send out 2 for 1 coupons, and allow a solo person to use that coupon for 50% off the price for one person, but good ol' Studio B Buffet at M Resort doesn't.      The cashier said something about how they've been ""fighting"" with management over this issue, to no avail.     After waiting in-line over an hour, I didn't even try to debate the matter with her (Yes, having that coupon was the reason I chose to visit the M Resort in the first place).

 So, you'd think I'd be happy that after my 62 minute wait in line, I'd be happy that I paid the $$ and would soon be seated, right?

Wrong.     Because after you wait in line to reach the cashier & pay, you then get to wait in another line for a host to seat you.    That line took 22 minutes, for a grand total of 84 minutes waiting in lines, until I was seated for lunch!

I realize that lines\/waits are a normal fact of life with buffets, but almost an hour & 1\/2 is not reasonable, and not worth it.   I've hit other buffets right at 'prime-time' lunch or dinner hours,
& the longest I've had to wait was about 30 minutes.

The pricing plus wait times means that once people are finally seated, they're generally going to spend longer in the restaurant than they would if they paid less\/were seated in a reasonable amount of time -- you kind of feel obligated to sit there & relax plus over-eat, as no one wants to just eat & leave in 45 minutes if they had to wait over an hour just to be seated.

   When I arrived at the M Resort, I couldn't find my 'Marquee Rewards' card for the place & I thought that was strange, as I have 6 other player cards that I keep in my wallet.   So I got a replacement.      After the ordeal at the Studio B Buffet, I realized that I threw their rewards card away after an hour+ long wait for the buffet a year ago!    The cheapskates can't even give you free wifi while you're in-line or in the buffet.  Yes, there's an open wifi signal, but once you join it, you've got to log-on with your hotel room #, etc.


   Bottom line:  If you're elderly, if you've got kids with you, if your blood-glucose level is crashing, or if you've simply got common-sense, don't bother with Studio B buffet if there's a line!    But if there's a small line (as there was when I left the place at 3:15PM), go for it.

  They *CAN* and *NEED* to do something about the long lines -- from past experience and listening to some of the people in line around me talking, the excessive waits aren't unusual, it's not like today was some sort of special situation.     They could easily implement a reservation system, so I could have been more productive with my afternoon instead of standing & waiting for 84 minutes (even if it meant I was gambling elsewhere in the casino, at least I could have been sitting & relaxing).  Another idea is to at some point, separate the line of people waiting to be seated into rows based on # in the party.  That way, if there were many tables for two available, parties of one or two could have been seated faster, instead of waiting in one line where you have to wait for a table for 4 to be cleared for the groups of 3 or 4 people ahead of you, or the group of 4 behind you in line waiting until they find a table for the part of 1 ahead of them, etc.",3,0,1

I was a bit hesitant at first at trying the buffet at the M Resort, but my family wanted to go there on our way out of Vegas, so we gave it a shot.  

The wait was probably around 30 mins for lunch which is normal for any buffet in the area.  When we were being led to our table, I looked around and was very impressed with the selection.  The buffet was larger than most, I would say. At first I thought to myself  ""there may be lots of food, but would it live up to my expectations?""  As I quickly began to load the food onto my plate, from cali rolls, pad thai, yellow curry, pizza, king crab legs, etc, my mouth literally began to water.  I sat down and quickly stuffed everything into my mouth.  I was instantly impressed.  Everything tasted so much better than normal buffet food.  

The pizza actually tasted like real pizza.  This was the first buffet I've ever been to where I loved the pizza soooo much. I've also never seen a buffet that served curry before.  The cali rolls are also worth mentioning.  They actually tasted like california rolls from a sit-down restaurant.  

Normally at buffets, I end up circling around all the stations and end up getting the same things over and over.  But not at the M Resort.  Every time I got up, I quickly dashed for a new and exciting station, and picked up a different item that I loved.  

The inside was super duper clean and nice looking too.  Oh yeah, there was this one worker lady that held a tray of like 1000 plates on her shoulder like I've never seen.  It was amazing.

None of the buffets at on the strip can compare to this one.  My favorite used to be the spice buffet at PH.  Every time I went to Vegas, I always looked forward to the spice buffet. But now I'll be making a stop at the M resort first.  It was soooo goood.",3,2,3

Arriving in the early afternoon, we endured a modest queue to get in to the dining area, but once we were seated had ample time to sample the majority of the buffet items.

Other memorable items were the BBQ wings, fried rice, and roasted chicken. Plus the gelato was scrumptious! Went back for seconds on that as well!

After we ate we were a little bummed because the food really wasn't that great. 
   Once we got to our hotel in Barstow California we went to our rooms to rack out. At roughly 7 pm I was in a fever and sweating and legitimately hallucinating. I called my boss saying something was wrong( I don't remember doing so). My boss got me into the car and took me straight to the hospital. I don't remember the trip or even when my boss got into my room and took me downstairs. I got to the ER with a fever of 103 degrees. They did their magic and I'm still here:) The scary part was when the doctor told us that I wouldn't have made it to morning had I not been taken to the ER. Btw my boss also had food poisoning. As we had tried differant foods it coulda been anything. Wanna know the kicker? Barstows hospital gets at least one FOOD POISONING a week after eating at the M. I guess that Barstow is the half way point of people coming from California and they get sick going home?

First, other than the split crab legs and the oysters, this buffet had no more seafood on it then just about any other buffet I've been to in the city. Second, even though we entered the buffet about 20 minutes after they opened, there were already items that needed to be refilled but there was scant personnel to do that. Not to mention general cleaning up of the buffet due to spills etc. The quality of the food left something to be desired also. The one piece of lamb I was able to dig out of the lamb, garbanzo bean and rice dish had no flavor. The half full pan of lobster(?) Mac and cheese had no lobster. I was able to find one piece in the replacement pan they eventually brought out.  Very few of the items looked appetizing and even fewer tasted good. Most  The ""hot"" dishes were luke warm to cold, including the ""hot"" crab legs.. They have a huge dessert section. It looked great.  Unfortunately, the quality was lacking there to. The donuts were stale, the other pastries needed sugar.

There were only two things I would go back for: the prime rib and the lobster bisque. The bisque was exceptional! If I could have eaten a few bowls of the bisque,I might have walked out a much happier customer.

Yes, beer and wine are included. The merlot I tried was so so and it was chilled.  Considering the price, and quality, I consider the alcohol more as a gimmick then a value.

It amazes me that as the buffets charge more and more, it seems as though the restaurant hires fewer people to take care of it, not to mention that whoever is in charge of the taste and quality of the food does not seem to be qualified for their job.

I was going to give them 2 stars, but considering the cost and the general quality of the buffet,I had to drop it to 1 start.

Save yourself time, money, and gas and pick another buffet. Very few could be less enjoyable at this price.",2,1,0

Out of all the buffets in Vegas, this is my ULTIMATE favorite place!  Usually go here around lunch time, and we didn't have to wait at all, and thank God we didn't since I was STARVING! haha.  My go-to buffet hands down for sure! They have an amazing variety of food.  Whether you be craving Italian, Thai, Mexican, Korean, and American. I'm pretty sure they will have whatever your palate is craving.  The options are endless and as they should be for a buffet.

Why should I even name what I like.  Just get a bit of everything, it's ALL good.  They also have an awesome dessert bar with all of the delicious sweetness in the world!  No worries there are also sugar-free desserts too :)

Price: Seafood buffet with unlimited alcohol (wine, champagne, etc) for $43.25 ($39.99 + tax) - Friday from 2:30 pm to 8:30 pm + all day Saturday & Sunday.

Studio B is located way off the Strip (13 ~ 15 miles away from the Mirage and approximately half a hour drive). It is so south that technically the buffet is located in the city of Henderson. I came here at a pretty good time because I didn't have to wait too long (about 5 minutes).

***

Food: Italian food (e.g. pizza), snow crab (hot or cold), jambalaya, swai fish, roasted turkey, leg of lamb, prime rib beef, NY steak, black truffle au-gratin potato, oyster, salad, sushi, masago mussel, teriyaki chicken satay, fruits, Kali beef ribs, curry, fortune cookies, chow mien, fried rice, Chinese BBQ pork rib, and DIY noodle station (pick your own noodle and topping, then add selective broth). 

Dessert: There were tons of sugar free dessert options as well as traditional desserts like flans, banana bread muffins, cookies, and gelato.

[Dish 1] Fettuccine, lobster mac 'n' cheese, shrimp, snow crab, jambalaya, swai fish, leg of lamb: Au jus tasted funky, but all seafood were above average. Non-seafood dishes were fairly average.

[Dish 2] Prime rib beef, NY steak, black truffle au-gratin potato, oyster: NY steak was greasy and prime rib beef tasted somewhat dry. but that black truffle cheese was pretty delicious.

[Dish 3] Broccoli beef, fried rice, sushi, Chinese BBQ pork rib, teriyaki chicken, mussel: Chinese food were actually pretty good (up to my San Gabriel Valley standards). Most Chinese dishes were somewhat similar to dishes from the Panda Express, but Studio B's version tasted a bit better. Teriyaki was dry and not good at all.

[Dish 4] Creme brûlée, almond cookie, vanilla gelato: I sampled pistachio and peanut butter and I didn't like them that much - I had too many $5 super fancy gelato in Los Angeles and these gelato weren't that great. Vanilla gelato was somewhat passable. Creme brûlée ... good flavors but it lacked the crunchy dark brown caramel layer.

3.5-star buffet, but I decided to give 4-star mainly for seafood & Chinese food. Now that I have tried most of buffets in Vegas (Bellagio, Bacchanal, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon) ...

As we roll up to the M Resort I walk up in anticipation to Studio B. This was my first time, but a few of my friends had already been. Although I try not to listen to hype they said that it was pretty tootin' n bootin' so I'll have to admit I was a little anxious. 

Now we ended up waiting in line for almost 2 hours total (well, for me and two others it was more like an hour. We went and deposited money to the casino while our awesome friends waited in line for us. Thanks you guys *insert cheesy smile and wink*)

Once we entered they sat us at the back, but it had a great view of the strip, desert, and even more desert. After waiting in line for so long we all went straight to see the spread. Now I have this problem when I go to buffets where when I see something appealing I get excited and get it right away leaving less space for me to get other stuff. In this case there was a giant selection. So as always I end up starting off with two plates. Don't judge. 

There was an impressive layout of seafood and they even had a whole tray of melted butter for crab legs. Be careful though, if you don't eat the butter fast enough it WILL solidify. They have your typical buffet foods, but what really surprised me was that they had CHICKEN ADOBO. For those of you who are not familiar with what that is it's a Filipino dish. I was amazed at the fact that they had this so I had to try it. Everyone at the table tried it, and we all came up with the same conclusion: It was a little salty, but pretty darn good. And we at the table were borderline shocked at how delicious the pad Thai was.

One thing that I must point out is their prime rib. It was so T-E-N-D-E-R that we used a butter knife to cut it. Yup, that's pretty tender. 

Dessert bar = extra workout time. 

They also have unlimited beer and wine. I'm sure that just added points in a lot of people's books. 

All in all I really enjoyed the food, and can see myself coming back here. I give it a 5 star rating because it blew my expectations out of the water, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Give it a try. Hopefully you'll find as much delight in it as much as I did.",1,2,3

I have partaken in my fair share of buffets. I would have to say that Studio B is top notch in every single department. I think I've finally found the holy grail that is THE buffet in which quantity and quality are actually up to par with price.

Service: Beyond excellent. From the greeter, to the servers, even the buffet line staff... everyone was very polite, attentive, and professional.

Quantity: I usually do a walkthrough before I settle on my buffet choices. This one took me a while to do. Seriously, I was a little intimidated and had to take a step back to take in just how many choices one really has here. Really, all you can drink wine and beer? OMFG, pinch me and tell me I'm dreaming! That cider of theirs is absolutely delicious.

Quality. You would think that the quality would suffer because of the immense number of items they have on the menu, right? **BUZZZZZ** Every item on their menu looks and tastes like it was made especially for you. None of that assembly line crap that you come to know and expect at other places. Osso buco so tender you'd think you were at Wolfgang Puck's, and believe me, I've had it at Wolfgang's, and this is up there. Juicy fried, baked, or roasted chicken. The requisite prime rib is seasoned and juicy to perfection. Crab legs, oysters and seafood galore. Fresh sushi and sashimi. Ahi poke. Salads of every variety. The list goes on and on and on.

Desserts? You say you don't have room after all those tasty entrees and booze? Make room. Just about anything you could possibly want, they have it, and it's executed masterfully.

Taps Fish House is close, but Studio B wins because of value (Taps is a steep $32.99 for Sunday brunch while Studio B is $29.99 on weekends and just $14.99 for weekday lunch). I realize I can get carried away with superlatives at times, but I was able to catch the $14.99 weekday lunch, and this might be the best value I have ever gotten from a buffet. Here are the things that stick out most in my head (mostly great, a few bad):

Macaroni and cheese - Before you smack me in the head for getting mac and cheese at a buffet, hear me out. I normally don't. But this mac...spoke to me. On my first trip I could hear the mac call out my name, but I decided to walk past it. When I got back to the table, I asked everyone how their food was. Cindy T immediately said that the mac and cheese is RIDICULOUS. Shit. I knew right then that there was no avoiding this mac and cheese cooked with diced ham. I got a scoop of it on my next trip, and it blew my mind. BLEW MY MIND.

Prime rib - For a lot of people, this is the main appeal of Vegas buffets. Unlimited prime rib. Many sins will be forgiven of a buffet if they can just do this one thing right. And not that they had to because they had so much other outstanding stuff, but Studio B does their prime rib MARVELOUSLY. I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the prime rib (I only meant to taste it), but that piece of meat was so good that the entire thing ended up in my stomach.

Panang beef - I just recently discovered the creamy, spicy miracle that is panang beef (like a month ago recently), so when I saw this at the buffet it was like a sign from God. The panang beef is DELICIOUS. It lived up to every expectation that I had for it. The pad thai is good too, but the panang beef over steamed rice is what you want.

Clam chowder - Another universal dish that pleases a large proportion of diners if a buffet can pull it off, and Studio B more than pulls it off. This chowder is FILLED with clams. It would've been heavenly with some tabasco sauce, but I had inhaled the bowl before a waitress could walk by.

BBQ beef ribs - I told myself that I would only eat a few bites to save room for everything else. But after I picked it up...I couldn't seem to put it down again. I pounded that bad boy. These aren't quite ""mind-blowing,"" but the meat is tender, well-sauced, and just really good.

Mahi mahi with mango sauce - I was so full and dazed at this point that I was only able to eat one bite, and I barely remember how it tasted. I'm pretty sure it was delicious.

Oxtail soup - Wasn't able to try this, and I'm devastated. Next time this will be first on my list.

Fried chicken - Dry and bland. Don't bother.

Madeleines - Sweet. Baby. Jesus. These things are amazing. They are PERFECTLY crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

Chocolate souffle - If you love chocolate, and I mean absolutely worship chocolate, you will die for these.

Pistachio shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.

Oreo shooter - Absolutely ridiculous.

Gelato - Absolutely ridiculous.

really good points:
1) wide open space - one side has a large wall of windows. Room and buffet lines all in rounded circles. gives a sense of open ness. The spice market was in a basement\/lower level with no windows. 

price - note lunch was 15.99\/person plus tax

2) creative variety of food - I thought the variety a flavor was really good. There was quite a bit of asian but the asian was a wide variety ie filipino, chinese, japanese\/sushi, thai, curries, etc. My favorite was the curry variety - I could have taken a quart to go of the green chicken curry.  My daughter said the sliders were to die for including what seemed to be a home made bun. 

3) free beer and wine - enough said  -  i have the werewolf which was like a micro brew. yum. They also have a home style root beer on tap for the kids\/teens. was also very good. 

4) amazing  gourmet desserts- I hate when there are a lot of desserts but they are all cheap\/common type. They obviously have a bakery as there were some samples of high end cakes. We had creme brulee, tiaramisu, red velvet cupcakes, mini cheesecake squares, chocolate krispie something, all super good. Also a whole freezer of gelato - looked like what we saw in Italy. 

Service and seating were okay and as to be expected in a buffet. My husband had had knee surgery so we were able to use the high roller\/handicapped line which was good. 

They had some really unique salads also like a glass noodle salad, a hispanic salad with cheese and raw jalapenos, and more. 

I give them a five for not feeling closed in, free beer and awesome asian and specialty items.  And nom nom gelato - also they have free cappacino! awesome!",0,0,0

Don't get me wrong, it was not bad. A solid 3.5. I would return. However would I return for almost $50 per person and an hour wait? NO way. 
This was a special occasion for me and my fellow Elite Allison S. I was celebrating my new job and raise, and Allison was having a meal she wouldn't be able to eat again for a while. We tried to choose wisely. Unlimited beer, wine, crab, and prime rib seemed like a safe option. Especially considering all previous visits here were excellent. We both brought our other halves and went on a double date. 
We tried to do a bit of a later dinner to avoid lines. The line looked pretty small, especially for a buffet. However that was simply a façade because we waited almost an hour! BOO! The buffet included the above mentioned, as well as pasta, Asian (including some sushi), American classic comfort food, and even oysters. 
Nothing stood out as amazing to me. The crab legs were salty, like unclean salty. And the wine was the best part. The fried chicken was pretty good, not too dry. The prime rib was buffet good. The selections of different cheeses is always the key to my heart, best believe I indulged. 
There wasn't anything here that was disappointing other than the long wait and price. They should consider a local deal for natives. Even a buy 3 get 1 free would be cool.

Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance.

Totally worth it.

Along with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol

So at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week.

There's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain. 

I never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this.

There's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though. They serve espresso and coffee in that dessert section as well, but I'm usually all tapped out to get anything from there.",4,0,0

I've eaten here at least 5 times (I've lost track), and each time I've seen lines dwindle, quality of the food go down, while the prices go up. On a recent trip, my jaw dropped when I saw that their weekend seafood price is up to $40 now.

That's on-the-Strip buffet pricing now -- getting into Bellagio and Wynn buffet territory. Okay fine, I thought. I will get my money's worth with their awesome hot, WHOLE crab legs. Although a little more work to crack open the shell, the reward is a bigger, juicier, and meatier portion of crab. But of course, the inevitable happened. 

The crab legs are now cut in half, which means less meat and more likely of eating dried crab meat. Call me a picky crab eater, but I missed the whole crab legs of before. I do like the prime rib, and some of the salmon offerings, but that's really about it for me. As I mentioned before, $40 is a total waste of money if you're not taking advantage of the seafood on the weekends. Otherwise, just stick with the weekday offerings.",7,4,4

We probably waited a good 70-90 minutes!  But I have to say, the wait was definitely worth it as the variety and quality of food bypasses that of the buffet at the Wynn.  Unlike the Wynn, Studio B also offers:  Lamb, oyster shooters, mussels, beer, wine and so much more.  The prime rib was excellent!  Tasty, juicy, and tender!

We even arrived at 4:30 PM with hopes to beat the rush, but still waited in line for an 1.5 hours just to get to the cashier, then another 20 minutes before we were seated- but I knew to expect that and my husband and I took turns playing the slots- so it's all good... (plus winning at the slots to pay for dinner was icing on the cake). 

I had been craving snow crabs and was very happy with the selection.   It was not salty at all and I actually prefer the non pre-sliced crab legs.  When I have to work for my food, it tastes even better- plus I am forced to take my time and not just shovel plates of food like a gluttonous pig.  4 out of the 5 snow crab segments that I cracked and peeled, were flawless and perfectly dipped in butter. Only 1 of them stuck to the shells. Not bad...

I also made sure to save enough room for a slice of medium rare prime rib and for a buffet, it was quite tasty.  Of course, I also had to stock up on some cocktail shrimp and something about the cocktail sauce had me wanting more and more.  Unfortunately, because I am pregnant I couldn't partake in the unlimited wine and beer, but who knows if I would take up precious stomach space anyways.  Regardless, our waitress was quite attentive and my class of iced tea was never empty, nor did a dirty plate sit at our table for more than a couple minutes.  

I did try the sushi and nigiri and I'll pass next time.  I did try a couple pieces of the tempura shrimp and veggies and those were delish.  But other than that, I had stuffed myself silly with crab legs and shrimp, that I didn't have a chance to sample much else.  However, the selection is quite vast.  The dessert station looked fabulous and I couldn't leave without a scoop of pistachio gelato.  Yummo!

I would skip this place all together. It's not at all convenient unless you're planning to be in its vicinity.

Where to go instead: 
I still say Cosmopolitan is THE best buffet. It's about the same price for MUCH better quality. It's French style cooking and creativity is by far the best. They use high-end and good quality ingredients. You can find truffle flavored risotto and such things here.

PROS & CONS of Studio B Buffet

Pros: 
Interior:
1) The buffet is huge and seating was not crowded
2)  Outside line was short and quick. Theres a warning of no parties greater than 4 but no one seems to follow that. Don't know what it's like at 11-1pm but we went there at 2 and the line was good. 
3) Covered & free parking lot 
4) Buffet  wasn't hard to find or far from the parking.
5) high ceiling
6) Noise level was low.
7) Food line was short and there was no wait to get food. 
8) Servers were quick and efficient  

Food:
1) Free beer, mimosa, champagne and wine :) - weekend only?? 
2) Dessert was good. Lots of options and the ones I got, mango moose, pistachio moose and creme brule were really good. Gelato was great. 
3) Clean and service was good
4) Crab\/seafood during weekend.. plenty of crab legs for anyone to eat
5) Prime rib was flavorful
6) Snow crab legs were plentiful and flavorful. 

Cons:
Interior:
1) Not that easy to get around the tables and railing. 
2) Food presentation wasn't all that great... 
3) Dessert presentation and the way it was laid out made it hard to find things.. or it didn't make it look appetizing. 
4) Far from the strip. 
5) This weekend, there was only one flavor of crab legs... is there more? 
6) There are dancing fruits looped on the screen... disturbing after watching it for 1 hour. 

Food: 
1) Lack of quality and food was done simply.. nothing special 
2) Mash Potato was TERRIBLE.. something so easy was botched... 
3) Sashimi & sushi was terrible. Quality of fish was not good
4) Ribs were not tender enough.. didn't really fall off the bone. Needed a lot more time. 
5) Coffee was terrible... even though there is a coffee bar. 
6) Raw oysters didn't look appetizing.. or fresh.",4,0,0

What buffet do you know that has all you can eat gelato with a good variety of flavors? This alone made my trip worth it! Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts!

While I usually don't eat the side dishes, I must say the tomato\/mozarella salad and corn salad were good.

The food selection was amazing and alcohol (i.e. light beer, cider, wine, champagne, etc.) is included in the meal price. At $33.99 for lunch it was the typical buffet price, I wish I could have stayed long enough to see how dinner was.

The wait staff is courteous and attentive. Bringing condiments and crab leg openers to the table as we got seated. 

Definitely going to try to make it out here on my next Vegas trip.

Potential Pro Tip: If you're in a larger group and staying on the strip without transportation, forget taxis and opt for a limo since they'll charge for 1hr and it'll get you to the buffet for a flat rate :) Totally trying this next time haha",2,0,0

The quality is a lot better than the rest as you can tell with their roasted meats. Compared to other places, the prime rib here is roasted in smaller batches which only means quality. If they're all out they have another one roasting away to perfection rather than a slab that has been sitting there for an hour. They also have sides of horseradish cream and grated horseradish, I prefer mixing both and it compliments the meat very well. I also like the fact that they also serve raw oysters along with their shrimp and crab legs. The king crab legs are pretty decent in size and they will never run out. The butter they serve with this is waayy too salty and is not clarified whatsoever big no, no. Another advantage this place has is the all-you-can-drink bar that serves wine, beer, alcoholic cider even root beer on tap!! However if you like asian food this place is not the spot to go, the sushi here is less than average, the pad thai tastes like dog biscuits (trust me I've tried them) and all the stir fried items seemed coaxed with gloppy corn starch thickened sauces. As for their desserts, there were sooo many I couldn't decide what to grab, for the most part they're all great but you must get the Creme Brulee.
Some things to try:
-Crab Legs
-Oysters
-Prime Rib
-Roasted Lamb 
-Lamb Osso Bucco (go straight for the marrow and skip the meat itself! trust me on this!)
-Ox Tail Soup
-Wood baked Salmon
-Creme Brulee
-Espresso to finish at the dessert bar!",2,0,0

The food was prepared fresh, didn't taste like it was sitting there for an hour. The quality of the meat was great.  ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE!! yes.. you read that correctly.... ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE!! 

Now what prevented me from giving this buffet a 5 star rating is the lack of certain necessities when at a Vegas buffet. 

1. During the time I ate there, they had no prime rib. But I do believe they have it on any normal night. 
2. Crab... no crab when I was there. Although, i do believe weekends are seafood nights. Not sure if they have King crab or just snow crab. 
3. The wait. Went on a weekday and still waited about a good 45 minutes. Cant imagine on a weekend. 

Well, you would think that these would be enough reasons to bring the rating to a 3 star, but the food that they did have was amazing. And to top it off....

Arriving late for the lunch service we paid the lunch price $16.99. But by the time we were seated the brunch was on dinner service and others were paying $24.99. I don't know if the food options change much from lunch to dinner, but I was very pleased with what we paid for what we received. 

I don't go to buffets often. Like so many locals, I may suggest a buffet when friends\/family are visiting, but other than that, I generally do not step foot inside a low-end buffet filled with limited (yet dressed up to look limitless) tasteless food options.  I also avoid the high-end buffets with decent quality food and creative options where you will pay high-end prices for food options you don't enjoy and then serve yourself. 
Most average eaters can never get their money's worth at a buffet. They\/we head for shrimp and crab to try and justify paying $50-$60 for a subpar dining experience. I am happy to report with two crab stations  at Studio B, and a HUGE general food selection, you won't get caught up in  that frantic mediocre crab leg stampede. 

Studio B has a wide variety of dishes that (gasp) actually taste good. No really. I was not eating animal protein and I was able to eat a wide variety of vegetables (salad, curry vegetables, green beans), protein (hummus, bean and corn dip), and sufficient vegan\/veggie friendly dishes (pasta with marinara sauce, spring rolls, noodles, tabouleh, etc.). Others in our party enjoyed: kalbi ribs, oxtail soup, prime rib, and salmon. There is flavor and texture that you won't get at most affordable buffets. I appreciate that the food is continually replenished. And I love that I saw two different people cleaning up the buffet area. 

For my time, money, and general buffet bang-to-buck perspective, there are only three buffets that I would recommend: Wynn (high-end), Sterling Brunch (high-end), and Studio B (mid-range). That's not bad company, Studio B.",3,0,0

Pasta, meatballs, crawfish boil, sushi, noodle bar. Where do I begin?

24.99 for an adult. Labor Day weekend. They Claim the ""Works"". With a picture of seafood and steak. Yeah, sure. 

Seating for 9 was a huge cluster. Nobody knew where to seat us for some odd reason even though there are available tables in the back area. So we wait. Pay at 2:20pm Seated at 3pm.

I do a quick stroll through the buffet. Half the stations are empty at that time. So I pick a few of the ""Sushi"" and the rice is dry and crumbly. I try a Japanese Mayo Mussels and they are stinky.  something was deff wrong here. 

Smoked Brisket, dry and very smokey but lacking any flavor. 
Jambalaya, oh my lord. nasty stuff. 
Fried Chicken was extremely fatty chicken. You'd take a bite of the crust and the fat underneath was thick. 
Pasta was hard, not al dente. just hard. 
Pizza was also a sad disappointment.
Tempura Veggies was soaked in oil. 
Kalbi Beef ribs overcooked and hard.

Only thing I could eat more than once was the OX Tail Soup. Pretty decent. Though the OX Tail meat itself was very hard, so obviously not cooked long enough to be tender. 

Dessert and Gelato\/Ice Cream was Fine. Nothing stands out really then the Creme Brule. 

Not a fan of Alcohol, but I saw it was unlimited.

The buffet itself is in a very large round room.

The food usually includes an assortment of comfort food (mash potatoes, mac and cheese, etc), curries, sushi, pizza, salads, stir fried items, etc. On the dessert side, Studio B offers gelato, crepes, along with the usual assortment of tarts and cakes.

I had been hearing about the M Resort's Buffet for some time and had been wanting to try it badly. First of all, it's called Studio B, not the M buffet (very helpful hint because googling ""M buffet"" doesn't get you anywhere). Coming out to Studio B is definitely out of the way when you're staying and partying on the strip, but it is soo worth that 15 minute drive. 

We happen to come on a Sunday around lunch (technically, the seafood bunch for $29.99 per person) and there was a hefty line. I was already pretty hungry, but the line moved pretty quickly and in 30 minutes we had a table and were on our way to the food. 

The food selection is huge! It snakes around with so many choices, different cuisines, so much variety. My bf and I have to survey all our choices before filling our plates. There is a lot of seafood choices, some American choices, a salad bar, good meat and fish selections, and then an Asian section. What is unique about the Asian section is that is actually broken down into different Asian cultures including Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian (not really Asian, but whatever), and more? Everything looked delicious, but of course, there isn't room for everything. 

The outstanding and the must have: 
-Crab legs. They had crab legs, 3 different styles! Jack-friggin-pot. Steamed, chilled, or cooked with an asian ginger sauce. All three were yummy. The ginger sauce was extremely messy, though. My friend noted that the chilled legs didn't taste watery or taste like they had recently been defrosted like some other places. A note to my primary care physician: there is a high possibility that I developed gout after this buffet.
-Eggplant parmesan. I don't know why I really loved this, but it was sure tasty.
-Dessert. Definitely leave room for the desserts! They were all amazing, but especially the gelato and the pistachio shooter. My friends also really liked the brownie that they topped with gelato, but I was too full to try it. 
-Sushi. Usually I avoid buffet sushi because they are overloaded with rice and are usually low quality rolls. Studio B serves large pieces of sushi that looked fresh and tasted delicious. 

The good and repeatable: 
-Prime rib. Good, solid prime rib, but not the best I have ever had. 
-Salad choices. The had many salad choices and all were very flavorful especially the antipasto.
-Sweet potatoes. yum yum yum. anyone else ready for thanksgiving?
-Shrimp. We had the Wynn buffet the night where their shrimp look like they are on steroids. Studio B has good sized shrimp, though. 
-Mussels. The ones topped with mayo and cheese (i think?). Delicious.
-Cappuccino bar. Great way to end the meal!

The only two things I didn't like here:
-The bathroom is outside. Whyy so far and so inconvenient. Buut I guess this fault is forgivable.
-Oysters. I was excited to see oysters, but they were small and tasted fishy and gritty. I'll pass on these next time. 

By the way, did I mention unlimited beer and wine is included with the meal?! Unheard of! You might want to take two strategies here: 1) forego the excess liquid to maximize food space OR 2) eat, drink, and enjoy the buffet for as long as humanly possible. Either way, you'll get your money's worth! I personally couldn't drink much alcohol right before the drive back to LA, but I tried their root beer on tap and that was dark, creamy, and tasty!

I didn't go hog wild but did dip my toes into a what could be considered a small fraction of what this buffet has to offer since the menu boasts 200+ items - that's no joke! The carving stations were plentiful with freshly sliced meats and there were seemingly dozens of vegetarian options. It's safe for me to say that there wasn't anything that I slid to the side and said, ""ew,"" but once again, I didn't get too adventurous with items offered such as mussels, crawfish, sushi... crap like that. But hey, it's there if you want it! 

The price? $16.99 per person, which is a hell of a deal! I know that the quality at some of the super ""high end"" buffets on the strip is far superior, but you're also forking out three or four times the cost.

I've been to this buffet twice (luckily when there wasn't too long of a wait time) and it didn't disappoint. Yes, the star of the show is the extensive seafood collection, including endless crab legs and fresh oysters. But their soups are also delicious - who doesn't love clam chowder with lots of clams in every spoonful? I also loved their tempura shrimp and prime rib. What I didn't enjoy from the entree section was their sushi and Kalbi short ribs - the sushi fish wasn't very fresh and the short ribs were sitting out for awhile, so they were grisly and tough to chew. What is most impressive is their dessert selection, with a multitude of delicious mini-desserts (I ate 2 creme brulees), gelato ice cream and a full service espresso\/coffee bar! It was an awesome way to fulfill a sweet tooth craving without feeling stuffed after the huge buffet.

There are no words to describe how bad of a food coma I got after coming here. I've been to a lot of buffets around the world, and I would have to give this #2 on my list (nothing beats the Singapore Hyatt buffet). Have you ever seen a buffet so huge that you can walk work off a good amount of what you ate just by walking around and looking for more food? 

The selection here is PHENOMENAL. You really have to pace yourself, though, and try everything first. Then, you get what you really want. The Chinese food section is nothing special, so you can avoid that right away. Just make sure to load up on crab legs.

Desserts: HOLY SHIT. Whatever you do, save room for them. Even if you don't have room, walk around, go the bathroom, let everything out, and come back. The price you pay for your entry here will not be worthwhile if you don't indulge in the desserts. 

One thing I never realized is the free wine and beer, which I've only seen at a buffet on a boat in Finland. 

To sum it up, I didn't eat for 2 days after coming here. My friends and I invented a new term for the level of awesomeness that you achieve after experiencing Studio B: stomach raging.",1,0,0

Drinks came, but no chair. Not a big deal, because I could tell he was occupied with our big party. My dad went & grabbed the high chair himself. Our waters were never refilled, but wasnt a big deal to me either because I was enjoying the wine I had. All you can drink wine & beer! That was exciting.

As for food, the main star of the show that everyone seemed to love were the crab legs. I definitely enjoyed those as well as the prime rib. Everything else I tried was just okay. For dessert, I loved the banana crepes & strawberry sorbet. The cakes that i tried were dry. Their latte was blah, as it just tasted like warm milk with a tiny splash of espresso.

Unfortunately, I am not a big seafood fan. I like my protein from animals and birds. It seemed like every other food selection was made of seafood. I like to start with a big salad with alot of toppings but the salad selection here was joke. The prime rib looked extra rare with blood dripping from the meat, ah no thanks. My favorite was the jambalaya. It was thick and meaty. The sushi sucked. The mushroom ravioli was pretty good. The panang curry was alright. The star of the buffet was king crab legs as it seemed like everyone except us was loading up on the legs. I actually enjoyed their delightful desserts much more than their entrees. They have various creamy dessert concoctions in plastic shot glasses. They were the bomb! The petite chessecake was rich and delicous as well.

Third, food selection is wonderful. Weekends are seafood buffet but for someone who can't eat seafood they still have an awesome selection. Did I mention they have roast lamb?! The juicy rosemary roast lamb itself is worth the price. Their quality of food is as good as any buffet on the strip.

* Had their breakfast one other time and they really made a good impression by filing every station with delicious food, love this place.

All you have to do is gamble and they send coupons straight to your house. Just like that. ;) But, that being said, that's why we go every week. The coupons also give you a shorter line pass, so that's cool. The line is very long. Either go at off hours (like 5pm) or make sure your phone is charged so you can catch up on writing your Yelp reviews while you wait.

And since we're on the subject of gambling, did you know if you earn 700 points that day, the buffet is free? Yup. And it's not that hard to earn it in 1 day either - especially if it's 10x points or something. For locals, you really can't go wrong. They're doing it right down there.

Anyhoo, I think this is a great buffet. No, it's not Joël Robuchon, but it's a great buffet. It's not massive, but there are a lot of choices. You won't go hungry. ;) 
It's divided into different types of cuisine such as Asian, Mexican, Italian and American. The food is fresh and there's a large variety of choices. They also offer unlimited beer, wine and champagne included in the price. It's nice to tip the bartender - you go get your own alcohol. And, you won't even mind tipping, she's extremely friendly and always remembers what you ordered the first time. It's always busy, as mentioned before, but that's a good thing when it comes to buffets... it means the food is always turning over. 

If you go on Friday\/Saturday\/Sunday, it's seafood ($40). You get unlimited crab legs. Plates of crab legs that are already cut in half for you so all you have to do is dip them in butter and scarf them down. 

Do yourself a favor and start with desserts. Take a big plate from the dinner line and fill it up! Don't be shy. Delicious dessert choices. Easily my reason for going there. 

The staff is very friendly, but at times can seem over stretched. Order yourself 2 drinks (soda, water, juice) from the waiters, or ask for a pitcher, so you aren't waiting around thirsting to death.

Ok, so I was a loyal RIO buffet goer since they offer many types of food, and most are very good. They got the crab legs, the prime rib, and all the ""must-haves"" in Vegas.. BUT they slowly changed and now its become gross.. So i discovered the M buffet a few months back.. It was TOPS, super good, high level of food for sure!

BUT! This previous weekend I went, spent 32 bucks and regretted it the entire time. It was HORRIBLE, food was old, seafood was pastie! THE CRAB LEGS WERE ALL MUSHY(lacked the texture of crab). Their cocktail shrimps were ""eh"" and their oysters were ""OK"".

As for the hot food, it was ridiculous, everything looked old.. like panda express at 230pm or something(left over from lunch). SO I KNOW, you're thinking you must of went on the off-time. so we waited around till 5ish, when there was a good 1-hour wait outside(line to get in) and they set out fresh dinner food..

The fish was all gross, the food was gross, prime-rib tasted more like subway roast beef... SIGH, this was my new fave, now its my new most hated.. i would say this is about 1 click below hometown at 4x the price... sad..... so sad...a few of my friends and I found the same findings...

I consider Bellagio's buffet to be my favorite premium buffet, but this buffet makes every previous mentioning of 'my favorite buffet in Vegas' null and void, except for Bellagio's. 

Some buffets in Vegas make a genuine effort for quality food, and studio B does a great job of doing so, and in return, provides very reasonable dishes. I've been here quite a few times already, and my go to favorites are at the carving station, which usually has tri tip, roasted chicken cut up right in front of you, mahi mahi served on half a bamboo pole, as well as roasted turkey. Their sushi isn't all that bad either for a buffet like this, especially when they bust out segments of rainbow rolls. 

The variety is almost up there with Rio's, with your typical Asian (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, even Thai!), Italian, American, and Mexican food. Their desserts are in a separate section of the buffet, but they offer a good selection of gelato. Personal favorites are the banana and nougat. 

Another reason why I'm giving this 5 stars? Alcohol comes with the buffet!!! Last I remember they served PBR, bud light, and their own custom brew. They also offer wine if beer isn't your thing. 

Expect there to be a wait to get in, especially during lunch and dinner peak hours. I recall spending over an hour waiting for lunch, all while the prices have gradually gone up every time I've been in town.

I was a bit pissed waiting almost an hour to get in, but when it was our turn I understood why. Let me give you some tips when you encounter a buffet like this...

Don't be stupid and get things you can get anywhere: chinese food, pizza, fried chicken, pasta, etc. That is what they want you to do. A real player knows to get the seafood, meats and other exotic things that set a buffet apart. There are places to get the ""normal"" foods I mentioned before...it's call hometown buffet, look it up. 

I thought the prime rib stood out and honestly, the gelato bar impressed me. I did my best to pace myself and not feel like I was going to throw up (my usual experience) Instead I only had a couple plates of food, trying completely new things each time and saving room for dessert. I'm glad I did because the pistachio gelato and pistachio mousse w\/ raspberry sauce was amazing.

After waiting in line for about 20 minutes we finally get to the front and let the lady know the name of our party and the time of the reservation. She was so rude and said that the people paying hadn't shown up yet so we couldn't go to the reserved room. What in the actual fuck? This is a bad precedent to set with new customers.

The layout of this place can be a bit overwhelming - unlike other Vegas buffets, there isn't any signage to point you in any direction. However, after doing a once-over, you'll get an idea as to how it's set up.

Overall, I feel the food quality is better than other buffets on the strip (although the new Bacchanal buffet is now my favorite!) and you get the most bang for your buck. This place has the widest variety of desserts: pastries (sugar-free included!), gelato, coffees, and even liqueurs. Obviously not everything is amazing; some items aren't that great (like lobster bisque, clam chowder, and cream of mushroom), but I find that I enjoy the majority - enough to feel money well spent.

Also included in the meal are wines and beers.

NOTE: If you're looking for a LOT of seafood, you won't find a wide variety here. They do have shrimp and raw oysters and depending on when you go, crab legs.

I came here with my friends on a trip to Vegas hearing nothing but praise for Studio B, and it being heralded as the best buffet in Vegas.  My goodness, it is definitely worth the 15 minute drive south on I-15 to find out just how well Studio B lives up to its acclaims!

The seating area is very well lit and quite accommodating.  Food is served along the walls and a peninsula juts out and sort of divides the seating area.  Quite honestly, this peninsula is where all the good stuff is.  Crab legs served both hot and cold, prime rib, shrimp for days, bacon wrapped prawns.  I basically lived at this peninsula.  They also offer a wide assortment of foods typical of most Vegas buffets, Asian cuisine featuring Chinese, Japanese, and some Korean and Thai dishes.  Of course there are the Western\/European dishes as well.  But really the selling point for me is the quality of their seafood and prime rib.  The crab and shrimp taste so fresh and meat is tender and juicy.  I'm pretty sure I had 3-4 plates of just crab legs, shrimp, and prime rib.

There is a dessert bar on the wall closest to the entrance with a wide variety of decadent treats from macarons to cakes, pies, ant chocolate bites, culminating with a gelato bar.  Everything we tried was good, but I personally didn't have too many as I was till on my protein when everyone else had moved onto desserts!

It can be hard to convince a group (or even just one or two other people) to take a ride 10 miles south of the strip for a buffet with so many great options available on the strip itself, but I maintain that the Studio M buffet is the best buffet in Vegas and is totally worth the trip.",1,0,0

1. It looks messy.
 2. All the meat comes off and breaks apart or.... there was no meat to begin with and that's why they're cutting it open to make it seem like there was meat inside it... sketchy!
   3. What if I want to Crack it open myself. That's the point of eating crablegs.  You would think a nice place like the M resort would know this. 

Being real!  If you don't know how to Crack open crablegs, you don't deserve to eat it!!

We went close to 830p, which is the last time they allow anyone in the restaurant.  Argghh They were already cleaning up some of the foods I wanted or they wouldnt refill the ones that ran out.  I was a bit disappointed for paying that much and not being able to enjoy everything. 

My primary reason for going to this buffet were for the crablegs, but the prime rib and kalbi (korean bbq ribs) were delicious.  

What's up with the sushi area though? Why do they even have a sushi area at all? Seriously a roll with cold spam? They had tuna rolls too, but was pretty bad. 

Desserts were okay. Creme Brule was probably the worst, but their cookies were good. They ran out of mint chocolate chip ice cream which sucked because I had cravings for that.

Come on, if you come to Vegas on a weekend expect a line at the buffet ESPECIALLY if you come during lunch time! I hate people who complain overly much about waiting at a buffet line. DUH, if there're people waiting there's a reason for it.

Overwhelming is the first word I would use. This place is HUGE and with so many offerings, I wish I had multiple stomachs. Whatever your heart desires, they'll have it here. I love the oysters, they were fresh and succulent. I usually get my money's worth with the prime rib and today was no exception. 

The dessert section is where I usually gauge the ""awesomeness"" of a buffet and Studio B delivers. Dozens of choices and they also have a gelato case with many flavor choices but also...get this...a barrista! You can get your deluxe cappuccino and lattes included in the price of your buffet.

Even though I was only in Vegas for a short weekend, I had tried all the Strip buffets and wanted something new and different.  I looked up online that the M Resort has a free shuttle from the Fashion Show Mall, which happened to be located to the Trump building we were staying at, so we decided to give it a shot for a Saturday brunch.

The shuttle ride was a comfortable 15 minute ride from the Strip, and took us to the resort (which is pretty much close to not much else).  We first went to get a player's card to snag the $2 buffet discount (hey, I'm Asian and cheap), and then went to the buffet.  We were surprised there was such a short wait at 12:30pm on a Saturday, but we didn't complain.

Saturday and Sunday brunches are $22.95 with the discount; the price goes up $2 or $3 at 2:30pm, when they consider it a ""seafood buffet.""  The afternoon choices were ridiculously plentiful, and most importantly - GOOD!!  While there were some ""okay"" dishes, the overwhelming majority of our picks were just as good as some restaurant fare.  Everything tasted fresh and made of good ingredients.  My personal faves include the Thai dishes (penang curry beef had a nice amount of heat, surprising for a buffet!), the spicy tuna rolls, and the warm (!) crab legs.  The dessert shop had tons of really delicious choices, including 12+ flavors of gelato....it was nice to get a scoop and wander around the casino afterward.  I hear that when it switches to ""seafood dinner,"" for the $24.95 price tag you also get grilled to order halibut, alaskan king crab legs, large steaks, etc.  If I hadn't just eaten my weight in food, I would've hung around to see what came out next.

Another huge perk: All you can DRINK beer and wine is included in the low buffet price!  I enjoyed the M Cider but then switched over to 5-6 glasses of the Thomas Kemper Root Beer on tap.  I saw lots of other guests just swigging glass after glass of booze....why get drunk at the hotel bar when you can drink your sorrows away at the buffet line?

So even though we had to hang around the casino for an extra hour before our return shuttle arrived, we definitely thought the buffet was worth the side trip and drive down from the Strip.  If it weren't for the fact the shuttle times didn't work out, we would've found a way to go there for Sunday brunch before our morning departure flight!  The food here may not be as overly creative as Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian, etc. but its taste and value makes this the hands-down casino buffet winner!",2,0,0

Desserts are the best option here with the apple pie, cookies, and pecan tart leading the way. Items like stewed and braised meats work well because the quality doesn't diminish as quickly when it's been sitting out a long time as opposed to other dishes where timing and freshness matter. For example, the chimichangas and pizza crusts get soggy  after a while and mussels become rubbery. You should skip the sushi altogether.

The M Hotel is the place to go my friends.

The M Hotel is just a few minutes off the strip down the freeway heading back towards Los Angeles and I can honestly tell you, it's (almost) my favorite part of the whole trip.

The M Hotel has by far the best buffet I've eaten in Vegas. They have a lunch special during odd hours and I think during odd days of the week? But from what I can recall they're about the same price as anywhere else in LV. About $30, more or less. They have a wide variety in seafood (which is what everybody is so gun ho over) and meat; everything is great quality and I enjoy myself every time I go. Studio B never disappoints. 

Now, after you've successfully stuffed your face for two hours.. You obviously can't drive with major food coma, so what better thing to do then to wait for the digestion process to kick in then to play a few rounds of the games of your preference. 

I can't speak for everyone else but I like that I get to have a little bit more Vegas time even though I've already technically left the strip. Yeah sure the M Hotel isn't as ritzy as the Palazzo or as memorable as TI. But hey, it's the M Hotel -- filled with very old people and has a faint but distinctive pinesol smell.

I have high expectation from many 4-5 stars reviews I've read.  When I got there, my first impression was a good one because the line was long and the wait was  close to 1 hour and 15 minutes.  This gave me an impression that people really like this buffet.  

When I walked in, the first thing on the left is the alcohol.  Coors light, cider, root beer, chardonnay, and cabernet are some alcoholic samples.  The right side is the desert station.  Most deserts were very appealing and tasty.  Of course, there was 8 or 10 different kind of ice creams.  Some of my favorites are creme brulee, flan, pistachio ice cream, and chocolate cheese cake.

Once passed the entrance is the main food station.  It was laid out as one continuous curve.  Some main dishes were a little salty and others tasted  just a little light. There were American, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, and Japanese food.  There wasn't much selection with Japanese food, only two kinds of sushi. I had tri-tip steak, and it tasted just as good as the $30 steak from the Rio Bar and Grill.  There was some sea food but no crab legs: mostly shrimps, tuna balls, clams and mussels.  Other than the carve station, other food did not taste that great.  

I had gone to several buffets and each buffet has its pluses.  However, Studio B is not as good as people reviewed it.  I would not give it any more than a 3.5 stars.

We came on Christmas night and the wait was a whopping 3.5 hours!  The line snaked around the casino and about 1.5 hours into the wait they began issuing times that you could come back and get into line.  The problem with this system is that they would give out the same times to 100 or so people in line, with no indicator of your original placement in line.  So then everyone just congregated around the entry waiting for the line to re-open. When the gate did open, everyone bum-rushed the line and cut in from every angle.  It was a MESS.  I'm really surprised they haven't formulated a better process yet!  Needless to say there were many upset customers and they definitely could have handled this in a more organized fashion.

Regarding the food, there was definitely a wide variety of items, although the quality rather disappointing.  The prime rib was tough, the salmon (which we had to cut ourselves since the server wasn't there) was very dry and hard, and the pad thai was super dry as well.  Also, the cocktail shrimp were noticeably smaller than those at other top buffets.  I would've given up some of the variety for better quality items.

The highlights for me were definitely:
- ice cream station (felt like a kid in a candy store)
- coffee bar (espresso drinks served piping hot!)
- alcohol station (the alcohol wasn't the best, but i did appreciate having the option to enjoy free drinks with my dinner!)
- sweet potatoes (delicious!!)
- crab legs (warning: hard to open, be sure to ask your server for a tool to use)
- lower price point than bellagio, wynn

Also, definitely worth it to sign up for the players card.  Save $2 plus we got $5 in free play money. :)

Verdict: I'm glad I tried the buffet, but probably wouldn't go back anytime soon.  I would definitely pay more for better quality elsewhere.",0,0,0

But you know what they say, right? You get what you pay for. Don't get me wrong, there is a boat load of food here! Lots and lots of food. But it's quantity over quality. 

Okay, the good: The wait staff was very hospitable, refilling drinks frequently and taking up dirty plates. Food: The sausage pizza, the chinese ribs (easy to get the meat off and tasty) and the creme brûlée.

The bad: The bbq ribs were too hard to chew or get off the bone for that matter, mac n cheese was eh, fried clams had been fried way too long, ham is ham, turkey is turkey, most things were either too salty or tasteless. And the crab legs, what a joke. I really wish they would just omit them instead of providing these tiny little legs that have very little meat. And they were leaving the empty shells on the buffet line until they were WELL picked over. A.k.a., there were only carcasses left as the meat had dropped down into the water. I gave up trying to get any decent legs. 

The ugly: The rest was what you'd find at Golden Corral for $8. Carving stations, mashed potatoes\/gravy, fried shrimp, taquitos (straight from the freezer section), egg rolls, etc. 

Between this, Bellagio (we went 12\/30\/15, paid more and food was just as sucky, they got a 1 star from me this time around) and Wicked Spoon, I say save yourself the time (and drive to Studio B) and go to the Wicked Spoon. They are far superior and kids up to 12 dine for $15 anytime (we went 12\/25\/15). I challenge you to find a decent buffet that has the same price for 12 year olds, hint: there isn't one!

There isn't a ton of different foods, but what they did have was delicious!  Just enough variety to satisfy everyone, AND instead of only the so-so frogurt-ice cream vending machines most buffets have, they also have a server help you with GELATO.

+ Service: All the servers were prompt and friendly. 
+ Atmosphere: Beautiful ceiling and decor, lots of giant big screens to watch shows, comfortable seats, plenty of seating space, spacious walkways (maybe because I came here on a weekday and this particular buffet was off the strip, but whatever!), and clean. I never saw a mess that wasn't immediately cleaned.

BAD:
- Food: Well, I know what I like and what I don't like, so everything that was on my plate I was very satisfied with.  Some of the things on my boyfriend's plate......not so much.  I don't recommend the calamari (flavorless) and this baked citrus fish dish that was wrapped up like a rose and baked (that was so-so).  Also, my tater-tots went cold really fast!

If I have to complain about anything it would be the cocktail sauce for the fried shrimp. They should have it right next to the actual dish, but all they had was a ragu tomato sauce knock-off.

I do confess, our expectations were high, given all the press you hear about this place being possibly the best buffet in Las Vegas (no small feat).

Well color me not all that impressed (as well the wife).  We arrived just after opening to find a short line, that hardly moved at all.  I hate lines. We had a VIP pass so we were able to use the ""VIP"" line, but to our dismay, it moved no faster (possibly slower) than the general admission line!  

After a LONG wait to get in, we found another long, slow-moving line of people waiting to attack the King crab legs.  More frustration.  Did I mention I hate lines?  The crab legs were good, but grew cold quickly, probably because they weren't all that hot to begin with, no doubt to avoid lawsuits from patrons gulping down hot crab and burning themselves.

And at a ""seafood buffet,' one would expect a half-decent array of sushi.  Hardly.  Only a few choices.  And where was the lobster?  Oh, there was none. At a SEAFOOD buffet.  WTF?   The Rio seafood buffet has mini lobster tails, are you listening M?

Some of the other food choices were quite good, the various salads were all scrumptious, only it was hard to get to them because the line for the crab legs blocked access to the salads.  No excuse for poor execution.

One plus is the unlimited beer and wine, which I suppose would be nice if one wasn't driving home to the opposite side of the Las Vegas valley after dinner.  And perhaps if one was tipsy enough, one might overlook the issues with this buffet, perhaps that is the intent of the unlimited booze??

Their lunch price ended at 2:30pm and they would not allow us to have the lunch price.  We were charged the dinner price at $35 per person.  There wasn't a bad wait.  We left around 4pm and there was a bunch of people waiting in line.  

I would say their food is good for buffet food.  I am a huge seafood fan and they had crabs that were cooked 3 different ways, clams, raw oysters, shrimp cocktails, fishes, and some sushis.  Their meat selection was also good.  My favorite were the ribs.  I loved that they had extra sauce on the side.  Thats about all the food I ate.  As for dessert, they were all mediocre, but my favorite was the creme burlee.  The buffet also offers drinks such as espressos, cappuccinos, and different lattes.  They have 4 types of beer and 3 types of wines.  They also have root beer that they made.  

The service was very good.  They guy was constantly taking our finished plates and was very courteous.  Ordered drinks also came out fast.  

Overall, they have have good food for a buffet, but I would not say its the best food ever.  My disappointments were the sushis and desserts.

First - it's already at least 10 bucks cheaper than my other favorite Vegas Buffet - the Wynn - so that's already a ++

Second - I don't drink - BUT for those that do - free unlimited wine and beer (from the tap).  it's not of your chosing - I believe it's the house selections - but there was a variety and it's unlimited.

Third - you seafood lovers out there - this might not be the Rio's seafood buffet - but on the weekends starting at 2:30 - it's a seafood buffet as well.  There were plenty of crab legs, shrimp, oysters on the half shell, mussels, etc.  My friend was raving that the shrimp was really really fresh.

Fourth - Pastas, Fish and Chips, roasted meats, Asian selection, pizzas, etc etc...there were so many stations.  There were 5 soup selections alone.  SO MUCH FOOD.

Fifth - DESSERTS!!!  nevermind the selection - they also have a selection of gelato.  AND you can get some espresso drinks WITH alcohol in it at the same station.  You want some Kalhua or Amaretto with your espresso drink - you can ask for it here.

I'm not going to lie - I waited in line for a long time - maybe an hour and 1\/2? - and I went at about 1ish.  When we left, the line was still the same length.

Also - want a few bucks off the price?  sign up for the players card before heading over to the buffet - it's free.",1,1,1

There is no consistency in the food quality.   
Who made the genius decision to (weekday) eliminate the sashimi salad and replace it with TOFU salad ?  Tofu that was like dry jerky with absolutely no flavor.
It would be kind to say SPICY if something is - never expected it and being that I cannot tolerate spice was forced to spit out whatever it was that I bit into from the ""Sushi"" section.  As others have noted, the sushi is clearly 'pre-made', and poor quality.
The prime rib, usually tender, was like leather.
The asparagus soup had zero flavor.
The ribs were way overcooked.
The Asian ribs - usually delicious - had numerous cartilage-type bones and very little meat - tried a second time and same as first - no thanks.
The 'seafood-stuffed' Swai was stuffed with breadcrumbs - found nothing else. And, being unfamiliar with SWAI I googled it and learned it is #1 on the Consumer Reports list to NOT EAT.  Heres what Consumer Reports says: Why it's bad: Nearly 90% of the catfish imported to the US comes from Vietnam, where use of antibiotics that are banned in the US is widespread. Furthermore, the two varieties of Vietnamese catfish sold in the US, Swai and Basa, aren't technically considered catfish by the federal government and therefore aren't held to the same inspection rules that other imported catfish are.
How can you screw up Caesar Salad ?  By putting way too much dressing on it.
The Green Chili Pork was tough and very VERY salty. 
We don't go to buffets to eat like we will never eat again - we go for the variety.  

Cappuchino was good.  

Dinner 3:30pm Thurs June 30th was $25 per person. 

This is the 3rd time in a row the M Resort buffet has disappointed.
And a note about the front end workers - Especially the girls that seat you - You ALL need a serious schooling - if not for US coming to eat there, YOU would be either unemployed, or working elsewhere - you are not the gatekeepers of the golden booth - and a smile wont crack your faces.

If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Cannot rave enough about this buffet.  It's high-quality, but the price is more than reasonable because it's actually outside of Vegas.  It's more than worth the trouble of leaving the city though, believe me. I've never been to a buffet before where literally almost everything I tried was GOOD, from the pastas to the meats to the seafood, it was all delicious. I mean, the only things I didn't eat were because I was too stuffed to eat anymore. And there's so much choice - over 200 menu items! 

I took like one bite of every PASTA and they were all really good.  They also aced the CHOW MEIN, which was a surprise.  Usually only the cheap buffets get that right. However, their MASHED POTATOES were only average.  The Wynn's got them beat on that.

Their Asian section surprised me - they had SATAY CHICKEN and OX TAIL SOUP - never seen those before at a buffet.  (Unfortunately I didn't have enough stomach space to try those...)  

They also had my fave PAELLA, which I'm not sure was very authentic - the flavor was different from any paella I've had before - but honestly, I liked it better than any other paella I've tried, including once in Barcelona.

Favorites: LAMB SHOULDER was out of this world - never had lamb that tender before and the sauce was delicious.  The HULI HULI CHICKEN  was also ridiculously good. They really use high-quality meats here. You can totally taste the difference. Mmm.

SWEET POTATO TEMPURA - one of the few items I was somewhat disappointed in.  The sweet potato itself was good,  but I thought they had too much batter on it.

Their CREME BRULEE is awesome, but they shouldn't serve it in tin foil.  It leaves a little bit of that metallic taste behind.  Otherwise it would be such a good creme brulee.

The one dish I actually didn't like at all was the CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE, but I should have known better than to try it anyway.  Souffle is only good when fresh from the oven.  I just felt that since everything else in the buffet had been so good, I had to give it a chance.",2,1,1

BTW, you get $2 off admission if you present a player's club card.  Dinner was about $25. 

Ambience- Ultra chic.  Feels like a hip club more than a buffet.  Frankly, the largest buffet I've seen in Las Vegas.  It is absolutely huge and beautiful, folks.  

Food- Everything tasted fresh and even gourmet.  Nothing tastes overcooked or stale.

Service- Let's be honest, no one goes to a buffet for their service.  HOWEVER, this buffet had the BEST service of all the buffets in LV.  They were cordial, helpful, and extremely professional.  In fact, they might have had the best service of any restaurant I ate at during this stay.

We wanted an affordable lunch buffet for our entire family knowing we have little ones that won't be able to eat their money's worth and also a clean smoke free place. Did some research and found this place. It was a bit out of Las Vegas and the strip but we were out anyways. 
Its in a beautiful hotel, M resort. Yes the casino area was still a bit smokey and the line was long. Lunch ends at 2:30 but we got there near 1 and waited a good 1\/2 hr so we were all starving by them. So good thing because the food selection was crazy good.
Kids prices were fair and 8 and under was $12 and they were so nice giving our son who just turned 9 the day before the lower price. Adults were $17 for lunch, a good deal considering AYCE plus drinks-beer, coffee, wine. 
And I would've given 5 stars too for their amazing sashimi salad and ample crab legs but knocking a star off for some other dishes that weren't so fresh or great tasting like their pho, pasta, pizza, fried chicken. But I am really being picky bc if you stick to what is good like their fresh prime rib (that came after 3 bc we stayed that long into dinner service), oxtail albeit a bit fatty, Korean short ribs, bigger crab legs during dinner service, pieces of Cali rolls and salmon sushi, ayce gelato and sorbet and fried mushrooms lol they were a hit with me ;) it can easily be 5 star quality. Man, even their churros were good :)

Plus the waitress was ever so polite. Kept patiently coming to take away our dishes and refilling our drinks. We stayed there way too long and ate our fill. We had a ball too, enjoying the atmosphere and food. We came at a perfect time too. Not too busy as the dessert line did get long but we sat right there and was able to hop in whenever for gelato n pastries. Flan was ok.

We had Bellagios buffet the night before but this one can compare to it in terms of the crab legs, plus they have gelato and Bellagio doesn't ;) and way cheaper ..

Missing from the table were buckets or some other receptacle for discarding crab legs. 

There are other many other seafoody dishes to try also, as well as a huge spread of salads and the like. My favorites included the tropical fruit salad and beet salad. The desserts were good, and I tried the creme brulee, bread pudding and fruit crepes. 

They still offer complimentary beer, wine, & champagne (served by employees at the front of the buffet) and also cordials at the dessert bar.

Yes, unlimited beer and wine!

FYI- my review might be a little biased because I don't eat crab legs. The selections looked great but the taste didn't really measure up. Everything tasted fine but nothing really stood out. My favorite was the oxtail and I definitely recommend trying that.  Like some of the other reviews, the dessert bar looked awesome but there was only one thing that I liked- the coconut macaron. Everything else was too sweet and didn't have much specialness. Really disappointed in the gelato. We tried the Thai ice tea and coffee flavored ones and as odd as this sounds, it was too sweet and rich. It was difficult to eat more than a couple spoonfuls.

Mind you, I travel to Vegas about 3-4 times a year, and resided there for more than one... So, I'm PRETTY sure I've tried every buffet on and off the strip at least once (or even twice) in my life. (True fatty, I know.)

Once you've tried the Vegas or Henderson buffets more than once, you'll notice that most of them serve the same foods... in the same style... with the same taste. There's nothing wrong with that, considering all Vegas buffets are pretty good and satisfactory.. But if you want to try something different, definitely go for this gem.

Their presentation is quite classy for an all-you-can-eat restaurant. They serve a huge selection of food, and the quality of it all is evident. Rarely did I see an empty platter during my round trips to the food bar. The chefs behind the bars are friendly, too. During my last Studio B visit, I was addicted to their sashimi salad. Every time I walked back to get more, I always caught the salad chef making a fresh batch to serve.

The best time to go to Studio B is during the weekend-- It's when they serve their Seafood Brunch & Seafood Dinner.

It is quite spacey, tables aren't too close to each other, and unlike many other buffets it has natural light.

Buffet is always full of people, and there is usually quite sizable line to get in. Wait is often well over an hour. So you need to budget time to get there in time for lunch.

The down side is that its casino (M Hotel) is quite far from the strip, and you need a car to get there. But it is well worth it.

Locals often get two for one coupon for Studio B. Also many times we been there they had a promotion ""two for one"" for California residents, which makes it a really great deal.",0,0,0

But apart from the 2 hour wait on Black Friday, the food here is great.

Not gonna lie, the service wasn't top notch like the first time I had been here. The waiter forgot that I ordered water and when I asked him again, he was like ""Oh sure, of course!"" and both my dad and I were just befuddled at how no lightbulb went off in his head that we had already ordered that. And he was lucky that night, my parents and I didn't go crazy so he didn't have that many plates to clear.

The pumpkin and mushroom ravioli was DIVINE. I kept going back for more. The sweetness of the pumpkin was so refreshing in the ravioli, compared to all your typical meat sauce and cheese raviolis. The beet salad was also a great palate cleanser, I love beets! Ooh, and don't forget the prime rib! It was super tender and my favorite part was actually the more well done outer bits of the slice. And for the first time, I dipped the meat into the sauce that's supposed to go with prime rib...like heaven. In ma mouth. 

Let's see...what else, I don't know, they have all your typical buffet stuff, soup, salad, sushi, seafood, meat, classics, asian, etc. 

I looove their dessert line though. The banana crepes are soo delish and all the desserts are so cute. Little tarts, cookies, cakes and creams. And they even have a gelato scooper at the end. I tried as much as I could to my sweet heart's desire.

This was also a special occasion for me because I paid for our meal with my 1st paycheck ever :D I think because it was dinner and thanksgiving weekend, the buffet was about $37 or something per person. The grand total turned out to be about $111 or somewhere around there. 

It's really sad that M is so far off the strip. It's a really nice and classy hotel in my opinion. And I think the buffet is really reasonable and worth it compared to some of the bigger hotels right on the strip. 

I'll definitely come back next time during the cheaper lunch on non-holiday weekends!

P.S. It really irks me how buffet lines don't just give you a buzzer to tell you when it's your party's turn next...doesn't it make sense not to make people stand in your line for 2 hours that they could be spending depositing their life savings into your slot machines and crap tables?! If you let us wander while we wait for our spot in the buffet, we would definitely end up playing. Come on, it's vegas!",2,4,2

I'd definitely recommend going for the lunch buffet as I don't see much difference to dinner other than a few seafood additions like sashimi and baked salmon at the carving station.  I'd get there early if your a local, 11a for lunch, 5p for dinner otherwise you'll be standing in line for a good 45min-1hour.  

Highlights:

Free Wine and Beer - I'd recommend the M Cider

Desert Station - gelato bar, cappuccinos, espressos, lattes (hazelnut, vanilla, marshmallow, and about 6 other flavors), some of the best chocolate covered strawberries but only saw it during Wednesday dinner (?)

*note: you can only get 1 gelato, coffee, or alcoholic beverage each visit in line so don't try to grab a bunch for everyone at your table

Foods: excellent variety and most are surprisingly fresh for a buffet.  I always get the NY Steak, Caprese Salad, Ratatouille, Babaganoush with Cheese Bread, Pad Thai, and White Clams.

Price: 10.95 lunch, 17.95 dinner for Mon-Thurs.  Additional $2 off if you sign up for the iMagine Rewards card.  Currently the best buffet deal in Vegas.

Literally everything at this buffet blows away any other buffet you've been to. Don't argue, just go with it...The pizza is better. The salad is fresher. The chicken is juicier. They have sushi, Chinese, Mexican, American, etc etc etc. You name it, they probably have it. What I appreciate is that on Seafood night they have big, juicy crab legs. A good 5-6 plates of those and I'm good to go. Prices have gone up on the Seafood buffet recently to $39, which is a bit steep IMO, but know that you're getting great quality food for the extra $10-15 you would normally pay. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention to spectacular dessert section of the buffet. Awesome isn't a strong enough word to express my love for it. Everything is made fresh - I even got warm chocolate chip cookies. Ice Cream is delicious. The little candies they offer are really good as well.

Mediterranean, Italian, American, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, you name it - the variety presented is unbelievable. Pizzas, pastas, salads, 4+ types of potatoes (they even have mashed sweet potatoes with MARSHMELLOWS!), Asian bbq, American BBQ, enchiladas, sashimi salad, Asian stir fries, etc. - there is something for everyone! 

Seafood and rolls on a non-seafood weekday is mediocre, I suggest that people just pass and get other food instead. 

Unlimited beer and wine, but personally only the beer tasted good to me. Atleast it's unlimited! 

Lastly, DESSERT is AMAZING! I threw down 3 plates of dessert no problem - Spectacular cookies, cakes, shooters, creme brûlée, and this amaaaaaaazing chocolate soufflé will satiate all of you out there with sweet tooths like me.

Like many have mentioned, Studio B includes alcoholic beverages in their buffet. They give you the choice of red wine, white wine, zinfandel, champagne, beer\/lager, or cider. Then on the dessert end of the buffet, you could definitely request an Irish coffee.  Best part? Unlimited. You are allowed as many glasses as you would like as long as you don't vomit everything you ate back onto the buffet floor afterwards. I suppose depending on whether or not you drink these, this would be a home run for you. However, for someone like me -- who can barely eat her fair share at a buffet let alone drink her fair share of alcohol ... it is not something I look for in a buffet.

Studio B's prime rib is absolutely delicious. I'm not quite sure if I'm saying this because I was absolutely starving after the 3 hour wait to get in or if I really thought it was delicious. I couldn't really tell you. I could tell you that it was good. I've had prime ribs at many other buffets before and when I had Studio B's on Thanksgiving night, it definitely left an impression. 

There is a definitely good variety of food. They have seafood on weekends. They have a sushi corner, fruit corner, salad corner, Asian, southern, Italian, meat cutting stations, and a dessert area. I'm sure there's more but I can't quite remember. Some of my favorites (from the past and from recent) would probably be the spicy jellyfish salad, spicy cucumber salad, prime rib, fruit and dessert areas!

The service? Could be good or could be bad. It really depends. We've had a server who actually told us that wet towelettes are one per person at a table when we went one time for their seafood buffet. Forreal? You going to tell us that? Yeah, we switched servers and the next one just grabbed a whole bunch and plopped it right on our table. Our most recent server for Thanksgiving night -- her name is Pat and she is amazing. Quick, fast, and just an overall happy person to be around. 

Price? I suppose you can say it's decent for a Las Vegas buffet on the strip. And when I mean strip, I mean far end of the strip that no one really knows about half the time. It's $40 per person for their Dinner Seafood buffet, which is offered on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Monday-Thursdays Dinners are $24 per person. I find their Seafood dinner buffets on the pricier side. When they first opened, it used to be at the lower end of the $20's and seafood was offered every night. Back then, Studio B was a steal. It was literally the BEST BUFFET in Las Vegas. Now? With it's price, it's average standing to me.

But there are more good points than bad points! Why only two stars?! 

As I mentioned prior, I was at Studio B for Thanksgiving dinner. No, I don't mind the 3 hour long wait to get in the buffet. The line to get into the buffet is typically long if it's good right? Especially on weekends on holidays. 

When we got into the buffet, I pigged out. Yeah, I ate a little bit of everything that looked good. I had some assorted sushi rolls because I was craving for some spicy tuna and they had it. I typically avoid their sushi roll section cause I'm always worried that they aren't fresh. But hell, if they have it out, it should be edible and safe. I also had some crawfish, clams & mussels, veggies, meats, oxtail soup, lobster bisque, etc. 

I was so FULL. I could literally EXPLODE. My stomach felt so HUGE. And then 20 minutes after, right before we got home, something felt VERY wrong. Like it felt  TERRIBLY wrong. I felt the need to hug the toilet. The were huge red flags and warning bells going off in my head. My father's driving started to nauseate me. And without a doubt, when I got home ... everything I ate had came right out. And like clockwork to every food poisoning event, sharp stabs of pain convulsed my stomach every so often -- making me curl into a ball on the ground. What did I eat? The only thing I ate different from my family (they didn't get sick) was the assorted sushi rolls, crawfish, and clam & mussels. 

What's even worse was that I had to skip work on BLACK FRIDAY because of this. Let me tell you, I work in RETAIL. That is close to the #1 worst day to miss while on the job. 

In the end. Two stars. Yeah the buffet is great and decent but if there are foods I HAVE to avoid eating just because you can't do it right, why bother? Just take it off. I have no interest in having a repeat of this fiasco. I'd rather pay a little bit more of money to go to a buffet that won't make me sick and has rack of lamb on their menu. Thanks.",2,1,0

Still really enjoyed it.

Many other offerings were great. Loved the buckwheat noodles, ox tail stew, and more. Condiments were well organized. Meat section was good to, we missed the prime rib, but roast beef was still good. Mahi Mahi grilled on the bamboo stalk was ok for me, but my friends liked it. I felt it was a bit overcooked. 

There's a nice beer and wine bar as well and big dessert offerings w\/ gelato! Creme brulee and the dessert shots were oh so good.

One of my new favorite buffets in LV. Clean, well lit, the staff is friendly and attentive. They clear plates out faster than the $1 slot machines taking your money. This is well worth the wait in line.

Since I live in the South West part of town, I really wanted to check out the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort.  I read some of the reviews and many speak about the large variety of options that Studio B has to offer.

            There were a lot of negative reviews talking about the long lines, disorganization, and less than pleasant service - but I had to check it out for myself.  When my husband and I went it was strictly a personal visit and had nothing to do with writing a review or feature story, but just to have some down time and enjoy some good food that I didn't have to write about.  However, as you can see, it has turned into a writing project.

            We decided to go to what they call the ""Seafood"" buffet, which is on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings since seafood is something we both adore.  The line was long and took us an hour to get through to the cashier.  Once we arrived at the end of the stanchions and the next available cashier was finished with their customer we walked up to her and I was told that I needed to get back in line until I was called.  Not only was the comment rude and lacked any form of great customer service, her tone and demeanor was anything but friendly.  Smiles were definitely not part of the cashier's uniforms.

            After paying $40 per person (which includes all you can drink wine and beer) we had to wait on another line until we were seated -- this took an additional 20 minutes.  Once we say down it took exactly 18 minutes before a server came and asked us what we wanted to drink. I kept it simple and chose my usual iced tea with lemon.  We left the table to check out the buffet and after walking the entire buffet line, filling our initial plate and grabbing a beer, we arrived back to the table where the iced tea had still not arrived.

            I'm going to keep this part of the story short since there is so much more to say.  Bottom line I eventually the iced tea made it to the table and we never saw a refill for the entire time we were there.  We decided to just leave the food on the plates and go to Hash House for dinner.  The service was horrible.  My husband and I have both spent over 20 years in the food and beverage industry and we do understand that sometimes, you just have a bad day and things don't go well.  However, it was something that needed to be brought to the attention of management.

            I sent a letter into the Food and Beverage department explaining that the experience was less than desirable in hopes that they would take a look at some of the issues discussed and work on improving them.

            I was promptly contacted back by Melissa ""Missy"" Herber, the Room Manager for Studio B, who was very kind, professional, and appeared very concerned about the issues at hand.  She invited us back for dinner on her and explained that:

            ""The M Resort strives to deliver excellent customer service and memorable guest experiences.  Again we apologize on behalf of Studio B and the M Resort for any disappointment or hardships we may have caused."" And that we should ""Please accept this email as an invitation for two to join us for the Seafood Buffet again as I am confident you will leave having the kind of experience The M Resort is so well known for.  Your name will be with cashiers, please enter through the VIP line and let the cashier know that we have your name and they will take care of the rest.""

                  Missy was very correct, we would leave with a memorable experience. 

            We went back to the M tonight to enjoy the kind of experience that Missy said the M resort is so well known for.  When we arrived at the VIP line as stated, again, there was a very long line.  Once we reached the cashier and I gave her my name she looked in this white 3 ring binder and explained that my name was not on the list and Missy was not on property.  She then asked if I was sure that I gave her my correct name.  Really?? Would I really not know my name?

First, it's not overpriced like the Cosmopolitan Buffet where you are paying $70 for 2 people!  It's about $50 AND you get complimentary beer and wine.  Other places will charge you separately for alcohol.  Another thing that sets them apart is the quality of their food and their selection.  They have a variety of exotic salads and every dish from every corner of the globe offered was fresh and tasted great.  On top of that, their staffs' customer service was top notch.

The selection of food is super varied.  Pizza, dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), pastas, oysters, salads, snow crab legs, mussells, lamb, prime rib, chicken...It was really a good, diverse buffet!

I had:
Cesar salad: very good. not overly dressed. Fresh lettuce.
Mushroom ravioli with alfredo sauce:  amazing.  I had seconds.
Lobster mac n cheese:  a little bland, but big hunks of lobster!  I added some salt and it was good.
Oysters:  meh.  I'm a little cautious of eating seafood like this at a buffet.  They were ok, but not the best oysters I've had.
Baked potato:  it needed salt, but the cheese and bacon was great.  
Corn salad: YUM.  really delicious.
Lobster bisque: delicious.  quite possibly the best lobster bisque I've ever had.
Pho broth: no thanks.  It smelled great, but was not good.
Domas:  actually pretty decent.  Not super fresh, but they were good.

My fella had a TON of crab legs, and his only complaint was that they were pre split.  We have crab a lot, and he's much faster cracking and splitting his own, but he said they were cooked well.  

Dessert:  Whatever the tiny little cup of hazelnut and chocolate was THAT was my favorite.  The tiramisu shooter was ok, and the fruit panna cotta was good too.

Let me just say, you can and will get your money's worth based on their expansive selection along with their service. Like a team of ninjas, their waitstaff sneakily takes your plates to make room for the next round of food. It was a bit difficult to track them down for drink refills.

As for the food, my friends and I were impressed by the sheer variety of food, but slightly disappointed with the execution. From the entrees to the desserts, everything looked good, but the flavor was lacking. Love the prime rib, gelato, and creme brulee though!

What make this buffet amazing are the unlimited glasses of alcohol, the impressive selection of desserts and the extensive menu items available from Greek fare to Thai cuisine all at a reasonable price. Entrees include Pad Thai, Chile Relleno, Osso Buco, fried shrimp, sushi, curries, Eggplant Parmesan, Beef with Broccoli, along with many other dishes. During the weekends, the seafood buffet includes snow crab legs and oysters, so if you like these, definitely check out the buffet then.  

Whenever I go to this buffet, I always start off with salads, which are fresh and delicious. My favorites are the Greek salad (Romaine lettuce, diced veggies, feta cheese, and olives dressed in a simple vinaigrette) and the Caprese salad. I then move on to the entrees. I like the Mahi-Mahi (found at the meat station), which has been glazed with a sweet pineapple sauce and cooked on bamboo, and the grilled lamb (found at the Asian section), which is tender and glazed with a sweet fruity sauce. The Prime Rib and Kalbi are good as well; however, on some occasions, I have found these meat entrees to not be consistent in quality. I always make sure to grab a bowl of oxtail soup from the Asian section. Although the soup itself is greasy, I enjoy the exotic flavors and the tenderness of the oxtail. There are other dishes I enjoy at the buffet as well, but there are too many to describe in one review. 

After I've filled up on entrees, it's time for dessert- my favorite part of the buffet experience! And at Studio B buffet, they know how to do dessert very well, and deserve 5 stars. I grab a few slices of cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, and pineapple next to the sushi section so I feel less guilty about the upcoming sugar fest, and proceed to the small bar located next to the soup and bread section to order a glass of cider. Let me pause for a moment and talk about the cider. This cider is the only ""alcoholic drink"" I've tried at this buffet, but it's my favorite. I love the fruity apple taste, the fizziness, and the slight sweetness. It's refreshing and doesn't taste too strong of alcohol. Anyways, back to the desserts. My favorites include the Oreo Mousse and Tiramisu shooters, the Crème Brulee, the chocolate cake with the crunchy cookie layer, and the banana gelato (which tastes like banana fosters but creamier and colder). 

You may be wondering why I gave this buffet 4 stars instead of 5. Well, the wait to eat at this buffet can be very long, especially during dinner. I suggest going there early when they first open for lunch or dinner. Also, the price difference between lunch and dinner does not justify the change in selection of entrees. To get a better deal but with basically the same entrees, I suggest going for lunch (except for those who need to have prime rib and crab legs). Anyways, I always suggest Studio B buffet to visitors who ask me what buffet they should eat at. Although it's located about 15 minutes away from the Strip, I think it's well worth it for visitors who want a great buffet experience.",2,0,1

I just search for buffet restaurants inn Las Vegas and Studio B did not show up.  So I did the search for Henderson, NV (the actual location) and it still didn't display.  Whatever.

We got there at 6pm on the Tuesday after the Memorial Day holiday.  The non-priority queue was just two segments of the maze but it took 45 minutes until we were seated.  I'm not an experienced L.V. buffet goer, but this seemed nearly intolerably slow.  It would have probably been less than 10 minutes in the priority line.

Their system for seating people seemed very primitive\/inefficient.  There were a few vacant tables and a computerized table tracking\/management system would have helped make the line move more quickly.  Such a system must exist.  It should be less complex than the systems used by waiters submit orders and produce checks in restaurants with menus.  We were passing through and fortunately had six hours before our flight out.

The food mostly seemed to be of good quality and fresh.  If you think something isn't so great, there is so much else to choose from.  I especially liked the ox tail soup.  It is a bit of work.  The meat is still attached to the bone.  I suggest putting the meat on a plate to remove the morsels of meat from the bone and then putting the meat back into the delicious broth.

I almost never give much credence to dessert offerings.  But, I make a big exception here.  I was planning on my normal fresh fruit for a light dessert.  Then I walked by the very long dessert buffet.  It wasn't just the huge selection, but that most were served in quite small portions.  You could sample a half dozen different things without feeling like a glutton and over stuffing your stomach.  Still you need a modicum of restraint not to over indulge.  I like variety with quality in a buffet and don't go for quantity as many do.

The free beer, wine, and hard cider make this probably the best value in town.  The wholesale price of wine and beer doesn't mean that it costs them a lot but it is quite a savings over normal highly inflated by the glass or bottle in a restaurant price.  The retail price of the wine they serve usually sells for about $12 for a 1.5 liter bottle.  The red wine was quite drinkable.  I didn't try the white wine because it is chardonnay and I don't like the excessive woodyness of most domestic chardonnays.  

The location was fine for us since we were just passing through and I didn't want to have to deal with a possible traffic jam around the Strip.

Overall though, my memory from six years ago at Le Village Buffet in Paris, Las Vegas is more favorable.  Not considering the difference in food, I don't remember the noise level at Le Village to be as high as that at Studio B.  Some may like the ""high energy"" of Studio B but it almost seemed like a relief when we left the restaurant and walked onto the casino floor!  Probably would chance Le Village when years later I'm in or passing through Vegas.  I just find the incessant audio and visual assault on my senses to be very unpleasant.",0,1,0

We heard that the buffet was awesome, which was absolutely true. If you sign up for the iMagine Rewards cards, you can get $2-5 discount off the 'already inexpensive' $17.95 regular buffet cost. 

The modernized interior design of the buffet is very eye pleasing. The open floor plan allows easy moving around the different stations. Also, there are huge monitors all around and above the stations, listing the food available in that area, instead of those missing name plates that most buffets have. 

I have lived in LV for 13 years, and had my share of buffets, but the crab legs I tasted at Studio B were very juicy and not small (like a lot of other buffets). There is also a wide variety of other dishes like fresh shrimp, salads, prime rib, dimsum, etc. 

For those who like to have drinks with their meals, but just cannot justify buying a $5 beer, you will be glad to know that their house brand wine, beer, and cappuccino are FREE and are part of the buffet price. I love wine, and their wine is not bad, considering it is free. The petite-size desserts are plentiful and the presentation is awesome. Items, among many: creme brulee, muffins, crepes, macaroons, and gelato!

(Is bisque considered a soup?) All you can eat... Thank you Las Vegas, my life is complete now. You can keep everything else. The shows, booze, and whatever else and I will just keep this buffet.

I didn't JUST have the legs and bisque! There were a lot of other things to try, which I did for better or worse(just better). I ate a couple oysters (a first for me) ... it was like eating a piece of a tongue. Very good if you add lemon! Very weird because of texture... I also tried mussels! That was surprisingly good.

I barley had any dessert. I didn't want to waste space with all the other yummy sea food around. Still, what little I tried it was very yummy.

Believe it or not there was no wait on a Friday nite around 6:30. Friday is seafood night @ $39.99 per person. They had hot and cold snow crab legs, shrimp, sushi, ceviche, and oysters. Crab legs were split down the middle which made for easier eating, but they were pretty small. I tried two oysters and quickly I realized that I don't like oysters. :) Shrimp were of a decent size and I enjoyed dunking them in spicy cocktail sauce. I didn't try any sushi but it looked very fresh. 

If seafood is not your thing, they have lots of delicious meats - juicy prime rib, roast leg of lamb and turkey all at the I carving station. And TONS of side dishes including 5 or more different styles of potato, cold salads and lots of cooked veggies.

Other standouts included fresh poke, pad thai, kalbi ribs, and a pho bar. All meals include unlimited beer and wine. I don't usually like to drink when I am eating because I get very full, but I tried the alcoholic root beer and it was very smooth and delicious. 

My favorite part of this buffet is the desserts. They must have at least 40 different options! The creme brulee is a favorite of mine, as well as the chocolate lava cakes. There are lots of tarts, and pudding cups, cookies, cupcakes, eclairs and gelato. Also you can get your cappuccino\/latte fix here as well. It's like dessert heaven.

It's way off the Strip (20 minute drive), so it's pretty pricey if you want to go by Lyft\/Uber\/Taxi. Luckily, my friends and I drove to Vegas so we just hopped in our car on Sunday afternoon to head to M Resort. The Seafood Buffet on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is $39.99\/per person; I would definitely recommend you go for the seafood. Our group of 4 came around 3:00 PM and we were seated right away.

First off, this buffet price INCLUDES complimentary beer, wine, champagne, etc. I usually get a mimosa and a regular (fresh-squeezed) orange juice on the side. I like to start my meal off with a soup; I love that Studio B has a ""make your own pho station!"" In addition, the Boston clam chowder is LOADED with clam and the chicken noodle soup is also flavorful and delicious. After a cup of soup to warm my belly, I go for the hot plates of steamed snow crab, crawfish, shrimp, etc. The steamed snow crab legs are SO juicy and Studio B does a great job refilling it so it's not that hard to get a fresh batch. I usually like to dip my crab in butter to give it a little flavor, but the steamed crab legs are so flavorful that you don't even need to dip them in anything. I'm a big fan of crawfish and can pretty much each plates full of them... I like that the crawfish at Studio B aren't too salty like some restaurants. There is also an option to get cold crab legs (which are cracked for you) and other cold seafood like oysters and cocktail shrimps. I finished two full plates of seafood in 30 minutes! Moving on to the meats, the NY steak, tri-tip, and prime rib were all really delicious. They tend to be cooked medium to medium-rare though! I wish I saw the racks of lamb?! :'(

There is so much food at this buffet that I really wish I had the stomach to eat everything. Besides the seafood, I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with green beans, the Korean kalbi, the walnut raisin bread, and the strawberry banana & green smoothies by the fruit table. The dessert bar is heaven, but most of the patisserie desserts are too sweet in my opinion (the cheesecake, cream puff, donuts, crème brulee, cannoli, etc.) The crepe is to-die-for. They also have 10-15 flavors of gelato (in a cup or cone) for you to order.

- Locals praise this place, and rightfully so. You don't have to spend a fortune to get a great buffet. 
- All you can drink beer and wine is included. Holy Wayne Newton, Batman. I repeat, AYCD BEER AND WINE IS INCLUDED.  
- Their dessert bar is lovely, but what makes it a real teacher's pet is that it includes a pretty solid selection of gelato AND a small espresso bar. They have Irish Cream and Amaretto for your lattes and mochas, in case you're not tipsy enough from the AYCD beer and wine. 
- Crab legs. They cut them down the middle for you, which is perfect for lazy people like me who love crab but don't like doing the work. 
- Plenty of parking.

The Bad
- You need a car to get here. It's far from the strip. You could argue that this bullet point belongs in 'The Good' section.
- Are there better buffets in Vegas? Yes. But not for this price. 

The Ugly
- There is an emotionless cyborg named Liliana from Poland that operates the gelato and espresso bar. Her demeanor will remind you of Arnold from Terminator 1, not T-2 when he begins to incorporate human behavior. If you're a fan of one word answers, she's your gal. I also think they save a ton on their electricity bill, as the frigid personality of this ice queen alone is enough to keep your gelato at temp.",2,7,3

Lil Sis and I ventured to Vegas and stayed at The M Resort for the weekend, all we could talk about on the drive up is the seafood buffet this place had.  We had read some things in Yelp and also in ""other review"" places.  The Studio B got all high marks so we were set to go and could hardly wait to eat our share.
Upon arriving and checking in we decided to get a couple of drinks a their awesome beer bar to lubricate our bellies for the on slaught that was about to happen.  The food probably felt lke the French when the Germans was knocking at their borders........
the line was long, estimated to be about 45 mins to 1 hour wait, dammit!!!! However the host(ess) saw me limping around and said handicap people are welcome in the VIP line...bingo!!!winner!!!!  We or I with a now exagerated limp stroll on up to the VIP line and with a player's card the Seafood buffet is only $23.99 with all you can drink beer and wine included.  (are you freaking kidding me!!!)
As the hostess sat us down she kindly gave us the go, just like Kentucky thorobreds jumping out of the gates at Churchill Downs...away we went......We wasted no time to iit up the seafood bar, where they had stacks of fresh oysters, king crab legs, shrimp cocktails, and fresh sushi and sashimi.  I immediately piled on the oysters, sushi, and crab legs.  Oooh the crab legs, you had your choice of cold or warm.  I ate both, in fact I ate so much king crab legs that the show ""Deadlist Catch"" was guaranteed another season!!!!
We were devouring the crabs like there was no tomorrow, the way we were biting into the shell reminded me of Daryl Hannah in Splash.  After we got our share of crab legs and oysters, we finally looked around to see what else the buffet had.  There was actually a carving station that had prime rib, salmon grilled on bamboo, Korean bbq, NY steak, seafood pasta and a whole lot more.  I was very pleased that every thing we tasted was of high quality and flavor not like a buffet filler at some places.  They had 7 or 8 different soups for your eating pleasure, but seriously your at a buffet who the hell is going to eat the soup?  So, I tried the clam chowder and it was one of the best chowders I ever eaten, thick tasty and great texture.  Oh yeah, they weren't kidding about the all you can drink beer and wine, there was a beer and wine station where you can come back as many time as you want.  They had about four different beers and four different wines, honestly why fill-up on liquor when you have all these great food.  Nice marketing ploy!!!!
I'm not a big dessert guy, but I was impressed of what they had to offer.  First of all they have an Espresso bar and these desserts prepared individually that tasted so good.  Individually handcrafted and not your prepackaged sugar blast, each a work of tiny art.  Every one I tasted was the bomb, creme broule, canoli, fruit tarts, mousse, etc..etc...
Our big mistake was the two double Espressos we had, I thought my heart would explode.....man strong shit maynard........
For the quality, taste, service and price, the Studio B buffet has to be the best bufffet I ever experienced!!!!!  a must stop for my Vegas experience.",1,3,1

The beers they serve are Budweiser, blue ribbon, root beer (haha just kidding), I think they serve other types but I did not drink beer so I am not too sure. There is a bar designated to serve the drinks.

I came here for one of their Thanksgiving holiday specials. The line was ridiculous. We waited for a good 2 1\/2 hours around dinner time. We got seated in the back room, which had windows all around the room and we had a pretty view to complement our meal.

Alright, on to the food... I tried their turkey and other food. They also have appetizers to pair with wine such as cheese. They also have oysters, which is always the bomb. I tried to save room mostly for the drinks and desserts! 

Their desserts are really delicious! I ordered their cappuccino because I love coffee!! I also tried their creme brûlée, ice cream, fruit tart, tiramisu... All I can say is yum nom nom yum!

FOOD: While there was a huge selection, the quality of the food was comparable to HOMETOWN BUFFET or GOLDEN CORRAL. It was low quality food placed in an upscale setting. Well guess what? The food is still shitty. Huge selection of desserts and only a few tasted edible. 

SERVICE: our busboy was extremely rude and took plates that we were still eating from. Didn't ask if we were done with them or anything. Also, he never came around to ask if we wanted refills on our sodas even though everyone in the table clearly had empty cups. 

Also, the $5 discount for Californians only lasts until 7\/31\/13. The BF and I had to pay full price which was $15.99 each for lunch to eat hometown buffet quality food. Even for $10.99 I would not return b\/c the damn wait is ridiculous.",5,1,0

A buffet to me is never 5 stars, but this is certainly worth the price.  Get a Players card and knock a couple bucks off the price as well. Certainly the best 'locals' casino, although it's pretty far if you're traveling from the NW area of town...about 30 miles, but we went for the Journey concert and had some time to wander around.

Something to keep in mind regarding the wait:  If the line has completely snaked through the queue line they have, it's about an hour wait, at least that's what it was on a Saturday night at 5PM.   They should put one of those signs that they have at amusement parks that says, ""From this point, the wait is....""   You can also get a 'reservation', but that's really only good if you don't want to stand in line and would rather gamble or walk around a bit. 

The buffet layout is nice as it is a continuous meandering line.  The desserts are excellent.  Get a large dinner plate and load up on the smaller desserts and share with your seatmates; good way to sample a little bit of everything.

I am not coming back so said that I wouldn't take it and he asked what I would like so I told him the least he could do was offer me a refund.

Ya, I'm a foodie so I'm usually mixed about buffets. I'm all in on the all you can eat idea, but the quality of food usually isn't great on a buffet. Making food in massive portions and having them sit under a warming light isn't typically the recipe for great food.

The M resort however has apparently found a way to offer a great selection of food and keep the quality very good. 

Plus, this is easily the best deal going. $26 for not only all you can eat, but all you can drink too! And I'm not talking about iced teas or cokes included, I mean beer and wine as well! 

The dessert station even had french macaroons, which I have never seen at a buffet before.

They also have a private room in the back for groups that want to get rowdy, or for business meetings. How cool would it be to have a business meeting in a Vegas buffet? :)

Yes, it's a long way off the strip, and no it's not as big as some others. But for $10-15 less than you'd pay at other Vegas buffets, this place easily has the best combination of selection and quality that I've had in a long time.",3,2,2

I've read these reviews before my trip to M Resort, and I suppose I expected way too much because dude, I was NOT impressed. Mehhh. It's okay. 

I was in town a couple weeks ago, visiting some family and with all the chatter about this buffet, we decided to go. We arrived at the hotel at 2:30. There was already a packed line. Mind you, I was already starving, having saved my appetite for what I thought was going to be this orgasmic buffet. I really was at that point of hunger where anything and everything would taste good! 

Anywho, we waited and waited and waited in line. Finally, almost two hours later 8 of us went to the counter and paid about $26 each. We were seated quickly and our waiter was very nice and promptly brought us some water and iced tea. 

Now, for the food. It's basically a world buffet, a little bit of this and that from all types of cuisines. We started at the seafood and Italian food. My family chowed down on the crab legs - plate after plate after plate. I'm not a crab leg girl. So moving on to the meat. The prime rib was pretty good. It could have been a little bit more tender. They have a small array of sushi, which was pretty gross (sorry, sushi snob here). 

Being from Hawaii, I was happy to see that they had a Hawaiian buffet. They had kalbi ribs, kalua pig, etc etc. It was OK. I mean, it's pretty hard to beat the home made food. 

I do give this buffet credit for their all you can drink beer and wine! 

The dessert bar is quite large but the quality was OK. Nothing to really rave about. They have rows of bite-sized pies, cake, & cookies. They also have an espresso bar and ice cream cooler where the attendant can scoop your desired flavor into a small cup or bite-sized cone. 

I probably won't be back though because the food is not worth the long wait in line.",1,0,0

I'm definitely a crab-hunter at any buffet I go to - their crab legs were delicious and they kept them stocked (some buffets you are waiting around, praying they come by soon to re-fill). You can get them cold or steamed and the legs are cut in half for easy crab meat access! Paired with Chardonnay I was in seafood bliss.

I have a group of friends who stop by Studio B each time they leave Vegas without fail, and I decided it was time to make a stop at the M Resort.

For a hotel so far away from the Strip, this is a very popular buffet. We waited 45 minutes for the Weekend Seafood Brunch. But then again, that is standard wait time for the better buffets on the Strip. 

Once we got into the buffet, we understood why people, namely Asians, went out of their way to wait in a long line to fork out $34\/tummy. The food selection is GINORMOUS, the seafood is fresh (with 2 king crab stations - one on each side of the cutting stations, mussels (or oyster?) bar, a heaping pile of gutted cocktail shrimp), and probably the main reason why young adults visit this buffet: the complimentary ALL YOU CAN DRINK bar. Bring a few $1s to tip the bartender. 

Sadly, we didn't hit the bar too often, partially because there was always a long line. But we didn't mind, we were too preoccupied with all the food. Unlike most buffets, the food displays actually look appetizing. I was also busy watching the fruits dancing on the 50 projectors every 3 minutes :)

After a good 2 hours here, Studio B Buffet won us over. However, unlike my friends, I cannot see us eating here every time we're in Vegas. A few times a year should be enough to keep my cravings at bay... hopefully... and we'll be sure to visit the bar more often!",1,0,1

First of all, service is excellent. They make sure you have enough napkins to work on your plate full of crab legs and that your drinks never run out. Their prime ribs and baby back ribs actually taste yummy. It's not dry and chewy like some other places. I was pleasantly surprised. 
Their crabs legs are actually not frozen! (there is a frozen half cuts ones as well but I always go for the hot ones). In regards to their oysters, I don't touch them. It doesn't look all that fresh but then again, I NEVER touch any raw seafood at Bacchanal as well. There is no buffets in Vegas with fresh raw seafood. 
 I also like how you can get unlimited amount of espresso drinks. I always create my own adffogato by getting double espresso with a scoop of their vanilla gelato.

Studio B is located in the fairly new M Casino and Resort about 20 minutes from The Strip (using 15 South). Although the casino is located away from the bright lights and hustle and bustle of Vegas, the drive to eat at this buffet is well worth it.

Here is some useful information about the prices:
Lunch 10:30 am-2:30 pm............................ $14.99
Dinner 4:00 pm-9:00pm...............................$22.99

Seafood brunch (Saturday and Sunday) 9:00 am -2:30 pm...............$31.99
Seafood dinner (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) 4:00 pm-10:00 pm...........$31.99

The buffet also serves breakfast daily, but I didn't bother copying the prices down. Who wakes up early enough in Vegas to eat breakfast anyways?    

My group of 12 and I arrived at the buffet at 6 pm on a Thursday night and found ourselves standing in a very long, non-moving line. It took 2 hours before we were seated, however, at the front of the line is a lounge area where you can get started on your unlimited alcohol. Yes, unlimited red and white wine, beer, and cider; but I tipped the beverage attendant just to be nice  I had a taste of the wines, which just tasted like regular wines to me, nothing fancy, but it went well with the meal.

The buffet has your typical salad bar, which also included fresh mozzarella slices, cocktail shrimp, and tri-tip and prime rib carving stations. They also had a carving station for Bamboo Mahi Mahi which looked very interesting, but I didn't give it a try. According to my parents, it was kind of dry. Although it was not seafood night, they had many seafood dishes, including various styles of mussels (the baked mussels with the mayonnaise stuff was my favorite), this swirly baked fish, and also Paella. The buffet reminded me of the buffet at the Rio because of its International choices, including Mexican, Thai (the Pad Thai was very popular at my table), Chinese, Italian, and American. Sorry, no sushi here. Everything seemed pretty fresh and refilled promptly until near closing time.

The best part of the buffet was the dessert bar, so make sure to save some room for dessert. If you have a sweet tooth, this place is perfect for you. The dessert bar line starts with crepes topped with fruit, cookies, various macaroons, brownies, red velvet cupcakes, and more. I had the mini crème brulee, tiramisu, and cannolis which tasted exactly like the ones I get when I go to Jersey. All very yummy. What kept me going back to the dessert bar were the numerous flavors of gelato and sorbet. Mmmmmm.... I highly recommend the raspberry sorbet and the mango and chocolate mint gelato. What made the dessert bar even better was the available hot chocolate, cappuccino, and espresso. 

Overall, the buffet was awesome. Our waiter refilled our water glasses promptly and didn't mind making conversation with us. The staff was nice. Just be prepared to wait and starve in the long line if you don't get there early. I can't wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas and try their seafood night.",5,1,0

Bacchanal at Caesear's is a great buffet with both standard and eclectic options, but the longgggg wait can really be draining. Luckily, Studio B is not too far from the strip and if you're a local with a car (or know a local with a car), the trek a few miles from McCarran is worth it. Parking was super easy at the M, but that may be because we went there Sunday around 7pm. I was pleasantly surprised that the smell of smoke didn't smack me across the face when I walked in. The Studio B line was a bit confusing because the line you should get into after paying was blocking the actual cashier.

They don't keep the buffet overly packed and the space is so bright and airy so you can see the vast food options waiting for you.

And when it comes to Vegas buffets, Studio B at the M Resort is the current reigning champ in my book.  Maybe it's because they are located so far from everybody else on the strip that they needed something to hook in more visitors.  Well, they've certainly got me--hook, line, and sinker!

At the center of it all is the prime rib station.  It is quite apparent that Studio B has decided to make this the Vegas prime rib to end all Vegas prime ribs.  All other buffet prime ribs pale in comparison.  Now granted, this is a buffet after all, so you will have to be somewhat strategic in your timing in order to get the best possible cut.  Go up too soon or too late, and you will end up with a slice that is too close to the edge of the slab.  Hence it will be more cooked, i.e. dryer than the center cuts.  But what you do get will be succulent and flavorful rivaling even places like Lawry's!  OK, maybe it's not that good, but you will be pleasantly surprised at how good it really is.

To the left is where all the Asian foods are.  When you see actual Asians complimenting the Asian food at a buffet, that's really saying something!  I normally view buffet sushi as a sort of kiss of death, but I must admit, the sashimi salad at Studio B was pretty good.  Not just passable, but actually pretty good.  To the right is the more Eurocentric cuisines (Spain, Greek, etc.).  They have stuff like Paella, Caprese Salad, Tabouleh, etc.).  Point is, we all know that Vegas has tourists from all over the world.  Studio B has got mostly everyone covered.

Now the real star of the show (if you ask me) is the dessert!  Good lord!  Everything from the tiramisu, to the creme brulee, to the chocolate chip cookies are fan-tastic!  And bless them for making everything in small little portions so that you can sample everything!  I swear, biting into their desserts almost brought a tear to my eye.  Where other buffets have one ice cream machine, churning out vanilla, Studio B has Gelato!  In a dozen or more flavors!  This is not your typical buffet dessert of stale minicakes with a swipe of icing as an afterthought.  Folks, the desserts at Studio B are definitely legit.

People come to Vegas for all sorts of reasons.  Studio B has given us all one more reason to head to this desert town.",6,2,4

After all, the Studio B Buffet is where I had concluded my Vegas trip. After all, its near the outskirts of the strip. Actually not even close. I would say you check this buffet out on your way into Vegas or on your way out. Theres pros and cons for that as well but that is a whole different story. 

I cant really comment about the food, after all I was very picky with the selection. I did not try a variety of different things either. What I did do was do what all people do at buffets. I binged and binged and binged. But wait, it wasnt just the food that I was consuming plate after plate. It was the beer. THE FREE BEER. THE FREE DRAFTED BEER. You sure read that right. 

Yep. So I arrive and just like any buffet, there a wide variety of different foods to choose from. People seem to be taking advantage of the huge crab legs here along with the other seafood, served both chilled and warm so you know. 

My first attack was on french toast. Friends told me I was wasting space eating cheap things like french toast. Like they didnt know who I was or the way I can eat. 3 french toasts later, before anyone even sat down with their food, I was onto my 2nd plate. French toast was very IHOP-like. 

5 thick slices of prime rib later, I wonder if I got my moneys worth yet? Hmm I did not think so, neither did my stomach. Avoid the top layer of the prime rib. It was salty as hell. The salt got me thirsty. At this point, I started to wonder where the beer was? Sneaky Studio B Buffet puts it right in front of the buffet so no one notices. Too bad I have friends who dont let friends NOT DRINK when they are drinking. 

So I double fist it, 2 Coors Light beers please.Naturally this is the way to go. After all, who wants to get up and grab a beer again and again. 

At this point, the table is full. They wanted to go gamble about 1 hr to 1.5 hrs into eating. Go ahead I said. 

Three of us stayed back. We were taking up a lot of space considering it was just the three of us. We wanted to sit in a nice comfy booth which the waitress agreed to do so. 

We move with beers in hand. Now this was where the real damage at the buffet has begun. 

16 beers, 5 bowls of clam chowder, 10 pieces of bread, 10 chicken wings, 3 french toast and 5 slices of prime rib later, I dont know if we were drunk out of our asses at the buffet or were we just sick from eating so much. We killed 2 bottles of Tabasco sauce w\/ our chowder. Who knew that being drunk and eating clam chowder would taste so damn good. Props to their chowder, that was my favorite item there. The wings were pretty good too. But then again, when doesnt  wings go well with beer? 

Finally we decided to leave, gut sticking out and all, as I had to rush to the nearby restroom to take a huge crap. Thankfully the Tabasco sauce did not hurt me. 

Total elapse time: 4 hours. 

Best way to leave Vegas, in a drunken food coma. Make sure your not the driver either. 

Bye bye Vegas, until next time.",5,7,5

The crab legs are served split length-wise which makes it more convenient than cracking them.  They had it served in the Asian cuisine section with ginger, also cold over ice and even steamed hot with melted butter on the other side of the buffet.  This was the highlight for me and the lines for this particular section was a bit crowded.  

Other items I thought worthy of mentioning was the oysters on half shell, prime rib, three types of wine, dessert bar, and I was a sucker for their crispy fish and chips.  

Just $40 for dinner, we swung by a little early at 5 p.m. and there was little to no wait.  The line eventually built and finding our server to clear our plates started to be few and far in between.

The cons:  the lobster bisque tasted like nasty cheese whiz and it was discolored.  
It's a buffet and can get crowded when asking for service.

Prime rib wasn't as juicy as some other buffets but still pretty good. 

They have a barista that brews coffees, mochas, etc, as well as a gelato selection. I got the mango flavor and it was SO good! From the dessert selection I got the fruit tart, chocolate pudding, tiramisu, chocolate eclair, and sugarless chocolate cookie; however, the only dessert worth getting is the chocolate pudding.

It's $26 per person (excluding tax). Totally worth your money. We had to wait about 1.5 hours (because we went during dinner rush) to eat, but I thought the food selection was worth it too.

We helped ourselves to many rounds of beer and wine. However, the desserts stole the show (and I'm not that into dessert!). The gelato was excellent. At our table, we tried at least 6 different flavors and everyone had positive remarks. I also really enjoyed the churros.

The promotion is 2-for-1 pricing for iMagine card holders, until December 18. There was a large line but it went fairly quick. My husband played his free play of $5.00 (initial gift when getting the card- your choice of the free play or a t-shirt) while I stood in line. The majority of people in line were Asian. And the line proceeded to get longer and longer, even as we exited the buffet. Also worth mentioning, prior to eating here, we've eaten at the Cafe and Baby Cakes (yummy gelato). 

Let me preface by saying that there is fairly large seating here- booths and tables- I was amazed at the size of the buffet as well as the ambiance (let's be honest, the typical casino buffet lacks ambiance). We were seated on the farthest end- we had a pretty view- it's unusual in that most casinos and buffets omit clear windows and views. I was facing the window so the people's faces looked like shadows, but that was ok. There was also a demonstration area but it was a little secluded. Our server Solangel was very attentive (kept our drinks refilled) and busy carrying off a large platter of dirty plates and glasses.  

I had to be picky because there was an enormous plethora of selections: snow crab legs, sushi rolls, nigiri, oysters on the half shell, peel and eat shrimp, fried shrimp, fried fish, paella, carvers: mahi mahi, prime rib, turkey, and chicken, asian grill, custom omelettes, greek food, italian, sweet potato mash, bread, salads, and fresh fruit. I completely avoided all the heavy foods. I sampled the baba ganoush (it's good- but my hubby didn't like it), asparagus (crisp tender, not overdone), mahi mahi (ok- not the same when one you're so used to getting it fresh elsewhere; at least it wasn't fishy), okra wrapped fish (so tender- I almost debated getting another piece but I resisted but maybe next time...), peel and eat shrimp, crab legs- I think we found our favorite place for crab legs (sweet, fresh, and just enough salt)- not a surprise that this was the majority of our meal, mussels and clams (good), teriyaki chicken (yummy sauce using ), caprese salad, pineapple (very sweet). It's almost impossible to try everything here- because there is so much! Also, note that some dishes are not typical of the average casino buffet like Chicken Adobo (Filipino). Everything is top notch here. The price is slightly higher but it's worth it!

The dessert station was equally impressive; also where you get the gelato and coffee- the line can get pretty long since it's just one station, but the wait is not bad. Different kinds of macaroons, assorted cookies, creme brulee, flan (very good), tiramisu, chocolate souffle (yummy), carrot cake, chocolate cake, fruit tart- are what I remember- I'm sure I'm missing some others though. I had the peanut butter gelato while my husband had the coconut gelato. I wanted to try many other desserts but the portions aren't small enough- it'd be perfect if some of them were petit fours size, then I wouldn't feel so bad about consuming all those calories. I know, I'm at a buffet, just go with it.

I highly recommend this buffet to locals and tourists alike, but get the iMagine card in order to take advantage of the promotions. There is something for everyone. Beer and wine is included at lunch and dinner- have you ever heard of that? I cannot stress enough that this is simply not the typical run-of-the-mill boring casino buffet; it's so much better, in so many ways, from the taste of the food, to the offerings, to the ambiance.

First and foremost, they have a huge selection of different salads. and I do not mean your regular lettuce, with dressing and croutons etc. they had stuff like fajita salad, greek salad, and a different take on popular ones like chicken salad and macaroni. 

Some of the highlights were the salmon with pesto cream sauce. Very impressed, that alone could have been a great entree alone, partner that up with any of the two sides they offered there, and you have a great dish. Their tri-tip was great, and so was the shui fish caponata. They also offered a section for hawaiian bbq. which i was pleasantly surprised since i am a huge fan of that. they had beef short ribs, and oxtail soup. I was happy to see, a Gnocchi with bacon and peas dish. They did have chicken marsala, which I steered away from, I think that dish should not be prepared on a buffet line, it's best when served fresh from the stove. 

On to the desserts, the big winner here was their pudding shooters, pistachio and raspberry to be exact, they hit it big here. Their cheesecake, ehh i had better.  Creme brulee was fantastic.  And I decided to go with gelato, which i usually do not. I am glad I  did, because the Nougat gelato was a great finish to the meal,

With that much food to maintain, it wasn't surprising that many of the dishes were dried out, even the prime rib was dry, ugh.

The highlight was not the main dishes but the desserts, those were pretty good.  I probably would've been happier to eat nothing but desserts and multiple glasses of the beer (that's included with the price.)  Or even just a few desserts and a whole bunch of beer...that would've been a better combination me thinks.  Oh well, live and learn.",7,5,7

Wynn, Bellagio, Paris, Rio's seafood buffet do not even compare to this.  Another added bonus is the price!  Only $29.99 and all you can eat WARM crab legs with butter.  They have cold crab legs as well, but I prefer the warm ones.  The crab meat was juicy, but not salty.

Other highlights from the buffet that were my faves: Candied yams w\/ marshmallows, Prime rib, Japanese cold tofu salad, shrimp cocktail, and these french-fries\/tater-tot things by the crab station. 

Desserts:  Pretty much every dessert I grabbed was delicious. I've never had better dessert at any of the other buffets.  The gelatto was good, but I found the miniature desserts much better:  creme brulee, pistaccio creme thing in a shotglass, tiramisu.  My fave: Oreo cream pudding in shotglass (so rich & chocolately).

When that plan fell through, we instead went to the Studio B Buffet (what a lame name) at the M Resort, based on online reviews that paints the place as just as good as Bacchanal. Or so that's what my aunt told me.

The M Resort is so far away from the Strip that it is technically located in Henderson proper. Quite the drive to get there from the Vegas core. The admission prices are much cheaper than the Vegas premium buffets on most days. Great, until you find yourself in a two-hour long lineup, having to endure screaming kids, an infinite loop of TV promos depicting the resort as a sexy oasis (in the middle of nowhere), and the wafting stink of cigarettes from the casino floor.

I have never waited so long in my life just to eat at a restaurant. It's quite possible that they were trying to stall the line so we end up paying the higher dinner price instead of the (if i remember correctly, $18) weekday lunch rate. But by the time we got to the counter to pay (the lunch rate, whew!), holy shit, there's another lineup! One for small parties, another for groups of five or more. And it was not moving any faster. Heck, the shorter comp line didn't fare much better than the two-hour hunger we endured. I sure was ""hangry"" (very hungry + angry) at this point. I wonder why my stomach acids did not eat me from the insides from all this excessive waiting.

Only when we were finally led to our table, did we see how much of a mess this place is. It is a giant restaurant, with a lot of seating, half of which were empty or were still left uncleaned long after its patrons have left. What the fuck? I bet most of those in the lineup to get in could be easily accommodated in the empty tables. The incredibly disappointing level of disorganized and inefficient management and spotty service left much to be desired about the buffet experience.

The food however was quite a joy. There's a good mix of Asian and Western food available from the servery. I enjoyed the prime ribs and salads. And I love watching people line up to get king crab by the plateloads, as well as those bearing handfuls of unlimited complementary alcohol, which I did not take advantage of. Beer was the last thing on my mind when all I want to do is eat to death after a long-ass queue.

Our server was kind and polite, despite the lackluster attention to service detail Studio B was exhibiting. (It's also fun to read the staff's name tags that states where they are from.)

Suffice to say, I would not return to this middle-of-nowhere mess of a place. To begin with, I am not easily impressed with all-you-can-eat buffets, a concept that I consider to be overrated (after years of enduring bad Chinese buffets back home). I sure as hell will not line up and wait a long time to eat at a restaurant ever again--you have to be insane or very desperate to do that. Unless I suppose the lineup leads into Bacchanal--still curious about what that place is all about.

Should you choose to eat here, I absolutely DO NOT recommend you come in a party larger than four. Studio B is incapable of handling large groups on a busy day. In fact, we almost elected to break up our party of 7 into two separate groups to get in, if it was not for a little 'social engineering' (more like taking advantage of the confusion staff was exhibiting with seating organization, who insisted we not break our party up). The poor folks in front of us were not happy to see we were let in ahead of them.

Also, the washrooms (or restrooms, as Americans call it) are located outside the dining hall. Right next to where the queue curls up. Be sure to say hi to the lineup... or warn them about what a mess it is inside.",4,1,0

- $30\/person for Friday night buffet which includes seafood (steamed king crab legs, mussels, shrimp, etc) and beer\/wine
- Good quality food regarding the seafood, steak, and desserts. Everything else was just okay.
- Efficient staff. Very friendly and the wait staff kept up with the dishes. 

Cons:
- Customers are separated based on party size (group of 3 or less, and then groups of 4 or more). We had a group of 6 and it was at least an 1.5 hour wait around 6:30 PM on a Friday night. Groups of 3 or less had less than a 10 minute wait.
- At least a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip

Overall:
-Not sure I would be back again because besides the seafood and the desserts the food wasn't outstanding. However, the steamed king crab legs (served both cold and hot) are delicious. Also, I don't drink so the price isn't as good for me as it is for some people.

As if that's not enough to direct your feet towards Studio B Buffet in M Resort, the $14.99 Lunch price adds to the already long list of reasons why you must try this place at least once if you're heading to Vegas.

The food is exquisite for buffet food standards.  Cuisine from Thailand to Greece are represented well in this United Nations of good food.  For those that like to eat rabbit food-ahem, I mean healthy-you'll find enough salad variety to satiate your healthy appetite.  For those that prefer carbs, protein, and general greasiness, you'll be happy too. If you're like me, on both sides of the fence, stop thinking and go eat already!

The atmosphere promotes relaxation.  The spacious, high ceiling dining room presents itself like what your appetite should be like when you're here: huge.  The colors remind me of autumn, but that's what get's you to eat; warm colors like red and orange that fast food restaurants swear by, additionally, spreads warmth and a carefree attitude that is further encouraged by the unlimited wine and beer.  The desserts, oh the desserts!  I'll let you find out for yourself, but I must say, I try all the ice cream flavors just for kicks.

I always get the rose wine but I recently tried the cider: it's crisp, refreshing, not too sweet, and perfect!

The food: mediocre at best. A lot of the food was cold to luke warm. Whether it was the lateness of the hour (although we had 2 hours before the buffet closed) or what, I definitely like my food hot. So that disappointed me.

The dessert:  probably the best part of the buffet and the reason for my 2 stars.  The meringues were excellent! Perfect consistency and just the right bite to keep you wanting more. I think I had 5.  And the pecan tart? AMAZING!  One of the best I have ever had.  I usually don't enjoy desserts at buffets, but these were worthy of being sung praises!

The bad, which is the obvious, is the distance from the strip. Not being a native of Las Vegas, I go to Vegas, maybe 3-4 times a year, I would have never known about this buffet, had it not been for my relatives who live there in Vegas.

There was no line when I had gone (Sunday lunch, at around 12, when everyone is busy trying to head back to California). So, lunch time is great! But as the other yelp reviews say, it gets very busy on the weekends. So if you're trying to give this place a shot, go on a Sunday afternoon if you can, or earlier, to avoid the rush.

The crab legs were very fresh tasting, none of that ""this has been in the freezer at Costco for 3 days"" taste. They offered both hot and cold crab legs, which is a +++, as I do not like cold crab legs at all.

Did I mention I'm also allergic to shellfish? Lactose intolerant, and allergic to shellfish. I'm a walking time bomb ready to explode! Especially since... my favorite foods seem to be my undoing. When I go to the buffet, someone better call a paramedic and have one on standby, because I'm sure to be tempted to try and kill myself by eating shellfish.

The prime rib they had was very good, and in addition, they had plenty of variety, so it didn't give off the vibe of you getting cheated out of your money for a crappy AYCE buffet.

Desserts, they serve gelato! Lol, here we go, this is where I die. Just kidding. The gelato was good, I didn't have too much of it though, as I discovered liking the sorbet they had there much more! Very very delicious!

That's the way to go... you have to time it right.  The good thing about this is that the lunch items are piping hot and fresh!  We paid 9.95- what a bargain!

They had a small section of breakfast items- cook to omelettes, sausage, bacon, hash browns, french toast, scrambled eggs.  I remember that the hash browns being really good, and my husband liked his omelette.

For lunch, they did not have the much talked about prime rib (that comes out at 4 pm).  But we enjoyed their kalbi beef a lot.  They had a chef cooking it fresh on the grill... that was fun to watch.  Sushi did not look that appealing, so we did not touch that.  We liked the fried calamari too.  Everything looked appetizing.  They had a lot of food items that other buffets on the strip don't have.

Desserts- This was also really good compared to other buffets.  The selection of items was different than most buffets.

I can't wait to bring the rest of the family here.  This is truly the best buffet!",0,0,0

It's almost half the price of Bellagio and Wynn and the food is just as good. 

The prime rib is amazing, probably one of the best prime rib served at a buffet. The desserts' selection is crazy, and your buffet includes all you can drink wine and beer. Do I really need to say anything else?

The only reason this place doesn't have 5 stars is of course the wait. The fact that this place is so good is not a well kept secret. This place is really popular on the weekends and wait can get up to 2+ hours. So it might be a good time to get a player's card at M resort. If you collect enough points you can get VIP passes to the front of the line. 

On a side note M resort is also a really good place to stay. Rooms are cheap, service is excellent, their spa is amazing (so I hear from a friend), and you might be able to get ahead in line for the buffet.",4,0,1

The food is good and the dessert is even better.  Running at about $20 for a weekday dinner buffet without the seafood (seafood is only on the weekends) it is relatively cheap.  

When you first walk in the buffet doesn't seem as impressive as others like the Bellagio, etc.  There are TVs playing random video clips above the buffet, totally unnecessary, but cool.  If you walk straight ahead you will hit the meat carver.  The prime rib is where it is at!  The prime rib was well marbled and super flavorful.  It was actually more tender than some prime ribs that I have had from Lawry's.  They are sure to cover all of the ethnic foods.  You can get your Mexican nachos, Korean galbi, and Greek wrapped olives all in one place.  To get the most out of your meal, be sure to get your fill of UNLIMITED beer and wine!

After you get your fill of prime rib, be sure to save some space for the dessert bar complete with gelato and espresso!  The espressos are made to order and I got a sweet vanilla latte!  The strawberry gelato was a fave of our group.  It was creamy and fluffy at the same time.  The best of the dessert bar has to be the coconut macaroons!  I don't even like coconut and i LOVED these macaroons.  They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside without being too coconutty (you know that waxy consistency).

Highlights:
- Prime rib
- Gelato
- Espresso
- Macaroons!!!

I can easily see how the Studio B Buffet at the M received the Best Buffet Award in 2010.  Deeeeeeelicious :D",2,1,1

Buffets are an integral part of any Las Vegas trip, and after eating at the M Resort Buffet, I have found a new favorite.  This was actually the last meal my cohort and I had before leaving for home on a Sunday afternoon - and I gotta say, it was a blissful way to end the trip.

I know this review won't do the place any justice, since there's tons of food that I did not even get to try.  But here's my attempt:

I must mention that on this particular lunch excursion, the M was offering the seafood lunch, which is apparently different from the usual lunch menu.  Just something to keep in mind.  

OXTAIL soup:  this is one of my favorite dishes of the afternoon.  Tender, tender pieces of oxtail in savory broth.  I wanted to get huge bowlfuls, but I restrained myself so I could have room for more food.  I am still craving that flavor 30 hours later.  I am seriously going to try making this dish at home, in hopes that it will be on par with the M.

Beef Panaang: yummy with rice.  I was pleasantly surprised!

Poke salad: I love poke, and I love trying different restaurants' versions of it.  This was pretty good, although not the best I've had, but commendable.  

Ossobuco: This is the first time I've tried this dish.  It made me happy.  

Chicken Florentine: wonderful, creamy flavor - and moist chicken.  

Candied Yams:  Another one of my favorite dishes!  I usually skip over this dish at most buffets - but, well done, M, well done.

Crabs:  There must have been at least three different type of crab legs.  Some served on ice, warm snowcrab legs, and chinese style ginger crab.  All very good.

Raw Oysters: I just love it when a buffet serves raw oysters.  I go to town!

There's definitely much, much more in the entree section, but you'll have to check it out for yourself.  Now onto DESSERTS!

I usually don't care for desserts much at a buffet.  But it's a whole other story here.  CREME BRULEE!  Wow!  It's just perfectly done.  A nice crispy, caramelized sugar top, and flecks of vanilla bean throughout the body of the creme!  YUM YUM YUM!  

They also have a wonderful cheesecake, a pretty wide selection of gelato, and even espresso drinks made to order.  All the desserts were presented beautifully as well.  I've converted to a buffet dessert lover because of this place :)

And for all your alcohol-loving yelpers, beer and wine included!!!  There's the win!",2,1,2

I've eaten here twice in a weeks time.  It's pretty darned delicious. I would say that this is my favorite Vegas buffet and I've eaten at all major buffets on the strip (Bacchanal, MGM, Bellagio, Paris, Mirage, and so on). The only major buffet I haven't eaten at yet is the Wynn. 

If you know nothing about the above mentioned buffets I would suggest that you avoid MGM and Mirage, even if it's comped. 

Studio B stands out as my favorite because
1. The variety and selection of foods are extensive.
2. Almost everything that I've eaten so far was cooked to perfection. These are the items I've eaten in my two visits:
Kalbi beef
Tempura shrimp
Lemon chicken
Vegetarian Pad Thai
Ham fried rice
Stir fried veggies
Mac N Cheese - not so great - runny and lacks salt 
Brisket - this was a special item for Labor Day - superb
Fried chicken - only thighs - not sure if this is normal - decent but not the best ever
Prime rib 
Mashed potatoes 
Broccolini
French Fries
Caesar Salad
Mozzarella and Tomato pasta salad 
Merlot
Zinfandel
Cider 
Iced tea
Latte
The drinks are included in all meal pricing and alcohol is served at the bar near the left when you walk in. 
Pecan pie tarts
Fruit tarts
Crime brûlée - delicious 
Chocolate Molten Cake - I'm not a huge fan of chocolate because it's so rich and sweet.  This was delicious and paired nicely with the Merlot. 

Both visits have been along side my husband.  He loves their pizza, meatballs (they are huge) and sausage and peppers.  He is 100% Italian, mother is first generation born and his father moved here from Italy as a teenager.  He is highly experienced with Italian food and thinks the above mentioned items are top-notch. Personally, I can't really eat much and so I haven't had the room to try them.  I trust that he knows what he's talking about. 

We frequent Sunset Station, and Fiesta Buffet mostly because we live in Henderson and are given 2 for 1 meals every week. When we are too busy to cook we hop down to one and get a quick bite to eat.  Nothing is gourmet and many items taste okay.   For the price and ease of these two establishments we keep going back.  We spend three times the travel time and 5 to 6 times the $ eating at Studio B but the food has been worth it so far. 

Today we paid for 2 full price meals and left a 20 percent tip of $11.00.  

I highly recommend at least trying this buffet if you want to splurge or treat out of town guests.",5,0,4

The quality is even with the newer MGM buffets (TI and Mirage), but the assortment easily passes them.

I don't remember what I got because it's been two weeks but you guys should definitely try their pad thai! Amazing! Definitely save some room for the dessert because most of the dessert is perfect. My favorite was the brownie, fudgy goodness. I tried some in Atlantic City a while ago and it tasted even better! 

A few critiques about this buffet:
- The TV shows that there's French macaroons, but they only have coconut macaroons, but they were still delicious!
-The beef that they cut up for you looks kind of disgusting...
- The wait isn't because there's too many people (the buffet is huge!) The problem is that there's a lack of waitors to clean the tables. When we walked in, there were so many empty tables that just needed to be cleaned up.

Overall, this was one of my favorite buffets and I would definitely be back next year (:",0,0,0

I've been here before a few times and always talk it up about being one of the best, if not THE BEST buffet in town.  I took my wife yesterday for the Seafood buffet and the prime rib which she loves..... what a disappointment.....

The staff was terrible (with the exception of our waiter who was actually pretty fantastic for a buffet).  We were ""greeted"" at the cashier with an employee that barely acknowledged us and was busy chatting with co-workers while she rang us up.  Handed my credit card back with the receipt and not so much as a thank you or enjoy or something.... just couldn't wait to turn away and continue gossiping about some other employee... so bad start.  

We were seated and immediately got started.... went to the meat station and they guy literally just stared at us without saying a word..... the meat was not labeled so we got a slice of what we thought was prime rib... got back to the table and it was just roast beef so we went back up and fund that there was another meat station with the prime rib.  Asked for a slice and could see that it was very badly overcooked.  Prime Rib is supposed to be red or at very least pink.  This was fully cooked and dried out.  We asked if they had another one available since that is so overcooked and he said that they were all pretty much the same.  I was impressed that he was capable of speaking... but disappointed that they were just content with ruining every piece of meat they were cooking.  Tried eating it but it was terrible and so dry and flavorless that we just said forget it and decided not to finish.  (We don't like wasting food but not going to choke down bad food that we paid $40 per person for)  

They had flat iron steak so gave that a shot.... terrible... so dry I could barely chew it and had to stop after one bite.  

At this point.... we are struggling to figure out what they heck was going to be edible... it seroulsy felt like we were at a low end buffer that we should have maybe paid $12 for.... 

The crab legs were ok and clearly the only thing edible since that was the only part of the buffet that had a line... and it was super long at this point.  The crab legs are cut for convenience which I am not a big fan of b\/c it doesn't hold any heat and dries out while it sits on the buffet line.   The butter wasn't very hot so dipping in butter didn't warm it up any but it wasn't all that bad.  Just could have (and SHOULD HAVE) been better.  

Had the lobster bisque and it was rediculously salty.... they had baked potatoes out that had cheese and bacon bit toppings which I thought was nice... but they looked like they had been sitting out for quite a while... again... just dried out and not very good.  

I won't itemize all of the other items but the highlight of my mean was the soda that I was drinking and I ended up settling on eating caesar salad after wasting about 4 or 5 other plates of trying to find good alternatives.  

Once we had eaten enough... we turned to the deserts which overall were pretty good.  I am a big fan of Creme Brule but I am not sure how they pulled this off..... but the creme brule actually tasted like burnt egg salad...... yes.... BURNT.... EGG.... SALAD.....   what the hell is that??    The lady doing the ice cream seemed to be annoyed with her job as well.... but by that time we were numb to the whole experience.  

We mentioned our concerns to the waiter and he admitted that they started ordering a lower quality prime rib and it definitely was noticed.  We debated whether it was worth complaining to management about but we didn't want to be one of those people that sat there and ate a full meal and then complained at the end expecting to get a free meal out of the deal.  So we just moved on with life chalking it up as a huge disappointment and probably never going back.  

It really is too bad b\/c I can't tell you how many people I have previously raved about the buffet to.   Now I am aftraid that the M Resort buffet may be making me look like a jackass if this is the type of food and service that they are going to put out these days.  

I'm scoring 1 star b\/c of the high price, unfriendly staff, and zero interest in preparing the food properly.  Unfortunately I don't think that we will be back and will no longer recommend.",1,0,0

Pay $30 per person and (a selection of) beer and wine are included. Awesome!  My friend had M Lager, which I thought tasted too bitter, and I had the Rosea wine, which sparked me :P.

There are a myriad, eclectic amounts of high quality foods, but my mission was to take advantage of the $30 and grab the ones that are typically expensive if served in a dine-in restaurant.  From that 3 plates and desserts I downed, here's what I found out:

Dude, the Prime Rib is the WOW Factor and the main attraction of Studio B.  1st bite, and holey moley, it's so juicy, tender, easy-to-cut, buttery, flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth that I just had to had to get a 2nd helping of it to savor the beefy moment.  Other notable foods I've devoured and were TASTY were the Snow Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail, Tri Tip, Miso Butterfish, Pad Thai, Chinese Chicken Salad, and Eggplant w\/ Tofu. And foods that I thought would be delicious but disappointed me were the Assorted Sushi (yes they're extremely fresh but didn't excite me), Oysters (definitely an acquired taste =\/), Sashimi Salad (yucky!), Rotisserie Chicken (dry like the Vegas weather), and Bamboo Mahi Mahi (please people, DO NOT GET THIS & save the calories and room for others I've mentioned that are good).

Now came dessert.  To be brutally honest, Bellagio's version competitively offers more outstanding and super indulging yummy-ness than M Resort's.  But regardless, I will say that my favorite ones that I've sampled are the Chocolate Mint Gelato and the chewy, soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookie. (Side Note: I even paired with the gelato & cookie to eat it like LA's Diddy Riese =P, and it's downright so good!)

Overall, Studio B is truly a marvelous treat.  Service was okay, with the exception of the super cool and helpful waiter of mine.  But I was very happy spending every second to taste what I've put in mouth and receiving a physiologically almost over-satisfied feeling that I'll remind myself to return and experiment more deliciousness that I hadn't had room for.

The crab was great...not too watery or salty; shells were scored for easy cracking and when you cracked them open, the meat always came out in one big piece that was easy to eat.  That was definitely worth it.

So why is it that after waiting 2 hours in line and shelling out $31.99, I felt so cheated?

Okay, my family doesn't drink much, so the endless beer and wine deal was lost on us.  And I don't eat much shellfish, so the extra I had to pay for ""Seafood Dinner"" that weekend was also wasted.  But does that mean that on weekdays the buffet doesn't include seafood?  That's silly.

Even the staff and cooks. ex. while i was browsing around i noticed the corn was out, i didnt say anything just kept moving along and out of left field a cook asked if i needed anything with a new tray of corn on hand lol he said ""i read your mind"" jokingly 

FOOD- tonz of options but the most import thing ill note is that BEER AND WINE are included in the buffet!!!! Say whaaaaaaa.... ?  

PRICE- we came here for lunch around noon and paid $17\/ea. The quality of the food exceeded the price. Quality is better than your average buffet

There weren't much meats to choose from and everything just seemed okay. We ended up just mostly eating prime rib and crawfish, they didn't even have crab legs, but that could be only for dinner.

FOOD QUALITY:
Why hello! First walk in and I'm already drooling at the sight at all the food. While I agree that he ingredients were of all high quality, I felt that they didn't execute most of their dishes well enough to make things dazzle.  
Tri-tip was pretty good, tender, and juicy. Well-seasoned. 
Crab legs were pretty fresh, but goodness people why stack two plates worth of crab legs all at once? Have some respect and LEAVE SOME for the others! 
Honestly that's what I can only sort of remember from this place except .... 
ALL HAIL DESSERTS!
Best. Cheesecake. Ever. Soft, delicious, rich, bite sized so you can, guess what, EAT SOME REALLY GOOD GELATO! Mint and Chip flavor was extremely refreshing! Cookie dough? YUMM.. 
This was the one time I have ever splurged on so much SUGAR. And it was well worth it. 

Oh. Rootbeer on tap was awesome! More spice and less sweet to make it all the more refreshing. 
Unlimited wine and beer too? Uh. Yes. $17 lunch that rolled over to dinner service is well worth it.

SERVICE:
Friendly. Kind. Polite. Top of the line as expected!

ENVIRONMENT:
So.. pretty! and clean! Elegant. Modern. Enough privacy between tables and they have a pretty interesting layout to separate the dining tables and the buffet. 

Would I come back? YES! Especially for the desserts... and people who know me know that I rarely ever splurge like a pig on desserts.",1,1,2

This guy has absolutely no empathy for the restaurant's patrons and acted as if we were a bother and wasting his time.  I knew our conversation would quickly go south when he approached with a scowl on his face.  To quickly surmise, we had our reservations confirmed by the main number of the hotel.  When the restaurant did not want to honor them, I explained that the main hotel operator confirmed our reservation, and the Studio B hostess says, ""I hate it when they do that"" - admission that this is a known problem with YOUR process, not mine.  Tony Fakhri could not have cared less or been more uninterested.  His only concern was to dismiss the problem, not resolve it - poor leadership and not the behavior expected from a manager.  The hospitality\/food and beverage VP had better soon associate the poor reviews with Mr. Fakhri's tenure as Manager before it's too late.  I would recommend that busing tables would better suit Tony's personality and managerial abilities.",0,0,0

I try to eat right for the most part so a buffet has become a much rarer thing for me but I still like them quite a bit.

They have pretty great breakfast food, an omelet station, and as I'm sure others have mentioned, complimentary alcohol.  I really do think the food has a good quality to it, unlike many other buffets.  I like the idea of the pre-made salads rather than a salad bar.  The desserts are pretty spectacular for a buffet and there is a wide variety of them to choose from.  My wife is a big, big fan of the Bananas Foster\/Crepe dessert and so am I.

One thing that I can recommend as you arrive is to take in the buffet at the M Resort.  We left el-ay early on a Friday morning and we had a couple of hours to kill anyways before check in time at any of the hotels so Studio B is a good AYCE choice, especially for the lunchtime price of $15.99 a head...

Foodwise, not everything is available at lunchtime, but we don't need everything either.  We pulled in around 130pm and the wait was much better than we anticipated, just about 10 minutes, I think we missed most of the lunch crowd...

Because this was not my first time, I just stuck strictly to a few items that I liked and stayed away from the rest.  On this visit, I helped myself to the Braised Short Ribs http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=TOypqMuNN2weMWyprFgs3g#TOypqMuNN2weMWyprFgs3g and the Seafood Paella http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=FsR-Yv2GmcEqM_6gbA5o6A#FsR-Yv2GmcEqM_6gbA5o6A as I was watching what was being brought out fresh...

Naturally I went for the prime rib carving station too, can't pass that up.  I felt like comfort foods so I also tried the Chicken Marsala http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=AiTF7IQBAakDtDRxNiB1CQ#AiTF7IQBAakDtDRxNiB1CQ and the Beef Stroganoff,http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=n6iwKeY3AJFjm614Lg2HmA probably because I just like rice and gravy...

I stayed away from all the salads, any of the sushi rolls, and anything from the Asian stir frys or braising stations which is quite a bit but I was keeping with my initial premise of severely limiting what I was getting and not getting sidetracked.  The only thing else I wanted after about 3 trips back and forth to the buffet was some sort of pallet cleanser like a gelato,http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=wewAMZ18N6ZiOh2Ub4Uzmg  the gelato and dessert bar here is pretty good.

They send players card member discounts and even free buffet passes! Sometimes even for 2, depending on how you play.
They award the slot players with the free passes all the time. 
So now I'm happier.

Grab a plate with prime rib and a plate of hot snow crab legs. A glass of wine, champagne or beer and you get your monies worth!

Anyways, I see that my last review in 09 has old prices.
Its now about $39 per person for either lunch or dinner on the weekends.

PROS:
-2 carving stations, one always being prime rib.
-Snow crab legs, hot and cold! Already split in half!
The cold legs are salty. Get the hot ones!
You serve yourself so you can get plenty~
-Their Thai food is good. Especially their curry!
-Oxtail soup
-Salad options
-Kimchi -cuz im korean. Haha
-mac and cheese
-Red and white wines, draft beers, champagne, and draft cider included.
-DESSERTS galore!! Including gelato and a barista

CONS-
-Oysters doesnt seem as fresh anymore.
-cold snow crab legs are salty 
-dont have any pastas (sometimes i need the overcooked carbs)
-never had enough mussels out 
-they have a certain type if ppl who come here often and they are overall very RUDE and confrontational",1,1,0

It was my first time in Vegas so I decided to try this one. (Ive done tons of research for buffets before my trip) I love that it's off the strip so it was not as busy as I thought it would be (I went on a Saturday during lunch). The service is also what made it a wonderful experience. Our server or busser lady was super nice and refilled our drinks often. The cooks were very friendly. They engaged in conversation and always smile! (Bonus: unlimited mimosas and beer!) Price was reasonable for its quality and service. I paid $45 after tax. Dont forget, you get what you pay for! Their kalbi short ribs were delicious! Prime rib was great! EVERYTHING WAS GOOD!(except the sushi but never get sushi at any american buffet, especially if its in Vegas) This was the only buffet that I found that had oysters as well. I regret not eating more. They had a good selection as well. I went to the Rio Carnival buffet the next day for lunch and it seemed like they had more variety but the food wasn't as good (and no nice servers or unlimited alcohol drinks).

The seafood is fresh, dessert extravagant, beer free, bbq done right, asian dishes full of flavor without being overly sauced up, and an awesome coffee bar to finish the meal off.

I've only been to a couple buffets, but from the locals, I hear that M is the buffet to be and of course I can't really complain. The place is DELICIOUS and unlike any other buffet I've been to. I'm from Chicago and there is not a lot of seafood buffets and if there is one, its PACKED and always running out of crab with huge lines. The M has no lines for crabs because there is so much other food to chose from as well. I can't rave enough about how delicious this place is.

They have a little bar with home made beer, cider, and some wines, all part of the buffet price. The best part other than the crab legs at the buffet is their dessert bar. ABSOLUTELY delicious desserts with a gelato station as well with a range of flavors.

We arrived at 2:00pm and were not eating until after 4:00pm. If the food was astronomical, it would have been worth this wait. However I cannot say this is the case. And it is not as if the lines were insanely huge either. It just seems that they have either 1) a really slow seating staff or 2) They do not have enough seating in the facility for the demand. So basically the low ratings are because of the wait, the way the staff seated huge groups before the smaller groups, and because the food was just ok. The meats were really really good. But the sides were limited. There were far too many salad sides and no mexican food. It is awesome that they had alcoholic drinks and cappucinnos though. The deserts were pretty outstanding too.

the food was more decent than expected for a buffet. even though this wasn't the seafood buffet, there were mussels (steamed, and dynamite\/masago style), crab legs, salmon sashimi salad, and salmon\/tuna poke which pretty much equals a seafood buffet in my book. everyone who knows me knows im a sushi fiend and have undeservingly high sushi standards, and the salmon in the sashimi salad was surprisingly fresh, soft, and melty. i probably ate the equivalent of 4 restaurant sashimi salads, i couldn't help myself! 

the dynamite\/masago mussels were my next favorite target, and the hoarder in me wished i could shove 30 of them into my purse for snacks later...too bad they were smothered in dynamite sauce and masago...that probably wouldn't work too well hoarded into a purse. 

the rest of the food was not bad. not innovative like wicked spoon, but everything else i tasted was NOT disgusting, which is a huge win for a buffet. 

the desserts were gorgeous AND delicious. the creme brûlée actually had a crispy sugar shell, unlike at other buffets where the brûlée sugar shell is soggy. there's a gelato station and they also had macarons (just ok). the bread pudding was out of this world, probably the best i've ever had. i could have eaten 3 bowls had i not stuffed myself with salmon sashimi and mussels all afternoon long.

Not only are the lines bad, but the people keeping the line in order are very inexperienced in keeping people from jumping ahead and making this a organized wait. Once inside (finally) there is spacious offerings to please all. One other suggestion I might make to the organization there is to take away the coffee bar (with Kaluah, Baileys, Disorono...) from the same area as the desserts and ice cream.

I went here for the seafood buffet dinner which is what I heard everyone comes here for and honestly I wasn't that impressed. I admit, there are some selections that I felt tasted very good and very high in quality, but only a few. Everything else was mediocre, better than other buffets like TI but not worth all the hype. I guess a plus was the free wine and beer, that's probably why its so expensive? The dessert section was alright, pretty standard for a good buffet. In my opinion, I still think the wynn buffet is better...maybe even the carnival world buffet in rio too. And for a seafood buffet...they could have had a way better selection of sushi. I was expecting seafood choices more than just the crab legs and shrimp since it was talked about so much from yelp and everyone else. The mahi mahi wasn't that great and the prime rib was kinda dry.

I can't fault them too much for that since it is a buffet. But, I've definitely had better crab legs ... even at Asia Buffet. It was nice for it all to be halved though; made it so much easier to eat. The oysters were grainy and tasteless. Definitely wasn't a fan and I'm a huge fan of oysters in general. The prime rib was very good but only if you got it medium. There were also ham, NY steak, sausage, and ham for carving stations. The NY steak was cooked to rare.   I didn't get a chance to try the other stuff but they did have a huge assortment of offerings, including 3-4 different soups. The Asian section had really good sashimi salad. I don't know what they used to make it but I ate an entire plate of just the salad. The mussels and tempura shrimp in the same area were very good as well. I think what Studio B really shines at is their pasta, which was really rich and decadent. I really liked the lobster mac and cheese but it got really heavy after a while. In general though, the food really wasn't as good as I had anticipated, especially if it's the same menu as the much raved about seafood buffet. There were also a lot of options for desserts if you've got a sweet tooth. The gelato isn't the best around but it's decent.  

What makes Studio B unique is the unlimited beer and wine. Can't speak for the other drinks but they definitely make a strong mimosa. I had 3 or 4 of those suckers and couldn't believe how good it was. The third star is pretty much just for the mimosa because I'm pretty much just a huge sucker for any kind of daytime drinking.",1,0,0

This studio B buffet, like everything, was wonderful when they opened their doors. Well, after moving back to California and going back yesterday there, I was disappointed. The food is mediocre at best. Everything has the same taste. This was not seafood night. They have it only on the weekends. But if you taste the pizza, egg rolls, pastas, they all have the same, generic, institution taste food, blah. I tried the eggrolls; crispy on the outside, but the vegetables inside tasted mushy and overcooked. The pizza with cheese and tomato was blah. The dough was bland and the cheese tasted institute-like. I tried the chile relleno; some tasteless cheese inside with half a can of canned tomato sauce thrown on top. The rice has no taste. Now. the dessert section is still holding up pretty good. Desserts are still outstanding,  no complains there. Service is still pretty good.",1,0,0

When we visited him and his family three weeks ago, I made sure that part of our itinerary is to eat at this buffet before we head out to So Cal. The day came and to be honest with you, I totally underestimated it. It was awesome!!! The food tasted great and the people serving you were kind and courteous. For those in a diet (like I do)..no worries, they have egg whites as a healthy substitute if you want a good source of protein without the fat for your omelet. They have tons of lean beef, fish, and poultry as well. My favorite was the sashimi salad! The quality of the meats, seafood and veggies were fantastic! Flavors were balanced and not overpowering. 

Okay, to the dessert part...leave room in your tummy!!! You'll be diabetic by the time you leave...j\/k ;) TONS of selection!!! From gelatos of various kinds to cakes, cookies, pies, cupcakes, and many more!

To make it short, visit and be amazed! Don't listen to those who rated this buffet with a star or two...they are haters and picky. The line may be long but that really says a lot about the buffet...it's good! I love to eat and it's my favorite hobby so enough said and I suggest to try it.

Buffet doesn't close til 10 anyway..so why start removing foods at 930???

The only good things were the desserts. But chocolate covered strawberries were missing...& the free wine & booze (:

Maybe it WAS bad timing to go last night..but they shouldve posted signs or something saying that food will be removed at 930.and that the line will take 2 to 3 hours. 

5 star buffet in vegas??? I don't know about that. I give it 3 stars. Quality of food at 9pm didnt meet my expectations. Quantity of food wasnt enough. I guess i was so excited to go and try it because of all the rave of all the good food everyone says.

We came here today to celebrate the arrival of a new lead and the departure of another.  I've been here many times and love this buffet.  I honestly have a love-hate relationship with buffets.  Always love going there, but hate the way I feel when I'm done LOL.  

This place in particular has such an amazing array of food.  From Italian, to Southern, Mexican, Asian and Hawaiian Local.  This place has it all.  Now I'm not going to list all the foods I've tried today, but I will list the ones I really enjoyed:

DRINKS:

You probably know they offer free alcohol.  They have wine and beer.  My new favorite is the alcohol cider they offer on draft.  Very sweet with a kick!

In the dessert line you can get a cappuccino.  I added Brady's Irish Cream today and I wasn't disappointed!


FOOD:

Braised short ribs- boneless chunks of beef with veggies.  So tender!

Kalbi- Marinated Korean short ribs.  Super flavorful and savory.

Fried tofu and eggplant in black bean sauce-  The tofu has a lot of texture and the black bean sauce was thick and perfectly salty.

Fried pollock- great fish and chip style.  Beer battered and delicious

Tomatoe and mozzarella salad- small cherry tomatoes and mozz balls with herbs and oil.  Need I say more?!

Oxtail Soup-  Always a must!  Oxtail is tender and the soup is packed with flavor and ON POINT!

Carved Tri Tip-  My favorite is always the end pieces.  Crusted with salt and pepper.  Super marbleized and my fave!

DESSERTS:

EVERYTHING!  The crepes, bread pudding, chocolate souffle, creme brulee, gelato, cheesecake, pies and other desserts.  IT'S ALL GOOD!!

I definitely might suggest finding a VIP friend.  The lines get really long.  Fortunately the wait isn't very long.  All in all, this place is super down to earth.  It's on Las Vegas Blvd, but NO WHERE near the strip.  This buffet offers a little bit of everything and us locals continue to rave about the atmosphere and value.  If you're ever in the St. Rose-Southern Highlands area, be sure to check out this treasure!",2,0,0

For some reason, I just feel compelled to eat the buffet price in quantity ... that means (ooohhhh ...)

OK, first the minuses: seating is cafeteria-style. I mean metal chairs and laminate-tables. It definitely has an Indian casino feel. Some buffet items were obviously not that fresh or great. But since we ate almost 100% seafood and meat ...

The meats we ate were of good quality, fresh, tender and not obviously sub-prime cuts (prime rib good - have definitely had worse in prime rib restaurants). Leg of lamb, which you don't often see, was good.

Oysters - nice but we made sure we saw the guy put them out and got them fresh from him. Crab - it's the usual buffet crab, but the hot crab was hot and cold was cold. Asian ginger crab was pretty good. Asian mussels - NOT good. Mussel and clams in broth - good. Shrimps: it's what they have - Thai slave shrimp.

Desserts - normally do not eat these but what the heck. On the Vegas buffet scale of gnarly desserts, they have a nice combination of lighter choices like gelato, sorbet and I think - real coconut milk gelato (very good!). They have good meringues, good small cakes like carrot cake, and child-pleasing candy coated rainbow marshmallows. 

If you are a total pig you will like this buffet. I think it's probably priced exactly right for being off-strip, having some pretty good folk back in the kitchen who definitely seem to care about their quality and expressing creativity (desserts, salads) within the format, and very nice servers.

Yes, the booze is free - Vendange wine, various beers, hard cider and the best thing in buffet: tap root beer - think Death Valley and it is GOOD. If you factor in you can get trashed and eat crab legs, shrimp, meat, etc. then yeah, a good trip off the strip. Do NOT gamble in the casino.",2,1,0

1. Snow crab legs - These were the sweetest crab legs I've ever tasted.  My fiancee didn't even need to dip the crab meat in butter!  I still dipped a tiny bit in butter; needless to say, we made sure to eat plenty of their snow crab legs.  

2. Desserts - ALL OF THEM.  For a buffet, Studio B made sure to do a good job of leaving a lasting impression on its customers with the desserts.  Their ice creams were by far the best ice cream I've ever had at a buffet, and their creme brulee and chocolate souffle were very good as well!

3.  Unlimited drinks, including beer, wine, and champagne - There is no other buffet at this price point that I know of that does this too! Even without the unlimited drinks, Studio B provides great value for the price you pay.  When you add in unlimited drinks, choosing Studio B for your Vegas buffet experience is a no-brainer!",2,3,3

I consider food quality to be important and subjective but a general given. Overall, the M Resort buffet meets and exceeds all of my standards for a premium dinner buffet. It's comparable in all ways to the best strip buffets. The decor is very contemporary and upscale. The overall layout of the serving counters and the room itself is unique. The atmosphere is lively.Tables, counters, and floors are kept spotless. Foods are well-presented and well-tended. The foods available cover a wide range from standard items that you can actually recognize to numerous specialized, prepared dishes covering various ethnic cuisines. The prime rib, a major factor in my evaluations, has typically been tender and excellent tasting. The chefs are very proactive in trying to satisfy customers. I've never had an overall bad experience here. As with any buffet, your flexibility is the key to satisfaction. On some visits there may be more items that suit my interests than other visits, but that's one of the beauties of any top shelf buffet - there's rotating variety along with quality - and you have the opportunity to sample new items. Unlimted wine and beer are included in the price. There's a substantial array of desserts, if you get into desserts, but I don't think this is its strongest point. The friendly staff does a great job with table service. Management personnel are very visible and accessible; they sometimes even solicit comments from customers as the customers are exiting - somewhat unusual for a buffet. The prices make this place an extraordinary value. Beware of possible long lines after 6PM. Also, be aware that a more expensive weekend seafood brunch\/dinner menu is in effect here Friday-Sunday.

The drive isn't that bad if you take the Interstate 15; it's only a couple of minutes after you exit. We got there in fifteen minutes from Mandalay Bay. There was plenty of open parking (unlike some casinos) and the signs to the buffet were easy to spot. The casino was offering a $24.99 4th of July dinner menu. I also noticed a promotion: if you got their player's card and played at a table for an hour, you could earn enough credit for a buffet. I figured I would lose way too much so I opted to head straight to the buffet. I loved how clean the air was. The huge, open buffet room had a glass wall separating it from the casino. There were only a couple groups of people in front of us in line, and we were seated right away. A bunch of extra napkins were placed on our table and our waters were served as soon as we came back from our first trip to the buffet. Unfortunately, that was the last time we saw our server the whole entire meal. I knew she came by because our dirty plates were taken away when we were getting our food. But by the end of my meal, I was so parched from no water refills. It felt very unpleasant, and I would say I was disappointed in the service. In reality, the service was nonexistent. I forgot what the waitress even looked like. Even the servers from the other tables didn't want to acknowledge us. Oh well, I tried to make the best out of it. My family and I were able to sample some wonderful tasting foods. There were such a great variety of dishes served that day. For example there were BBQ ribs (American BBQ section), Kalbi ribs (Korean), and Honey roasted ribs (Chinese). My favorite dishes were the Poke tuna, Lomi Lomi salmon, prime rib, and the green chili verde pork. My least favorite was the bland, lukewarm make-your-own pho. For the price and great food, I will return. I have my fingers crossed that I will get a better server next time.",1,0,0

I have tried a multitude of buffets in Vegas and I think it's safe to say that Studio B is one of my favorites. I think the price of admission is a steal for the quality and the myriad of food selections they offer, not to mention all-you-can-drink wine and beer! I especially enjoy coming here for their selection of seafood. Their menu hasn't changed much over the past few years and I think they could spice things up and offer new items but I'm not complaining.

Honestly, the only reason I tried this was because of a lady with an accent gave this buffet super high marks on YouTube and said it rivaled Caesar's buffet.  

I can honestly say that this was comparable to a Golden Corral buffet in quality and presentation.  The food was obviously held over from the lunch buffet and there was spilled food on the floor and on the buffet line.  The food was terrible, but for $25.00, I gave it 2 stars.  Had it been more, they would have received just one star.

I love the reviews here saying this is the best buffet in Vegas.  All I can say is that they must be fake reviews, and for that lady on YouTube, she must have gotten a kickback for her review.

No question about it, Caesars Palace Bacchanal buffet is the NUMBER 1 best buffet in Vegas.  Having come to Vegas for 31 years, I have eaten at them all.  The only one that comes close to Caesars in the Sterling Buffet at Bally's but they are not open every day and the price is a bit high, but very good as well. However, I will say the Wynn buffet also deserves mentioning here as a quality buffet.

And no, I haven't been paid for this review, but laugh at the people that rate this buffet with high marks, as I can only assume they have never been to Caesars Palace for their buffet.",0,0,0

We asked where they wanted to go and they suggested the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, Spa and Casino in Henderson.  It is about 10-15 min south on the Strip from Mandalay Bay and Airport, which was perfect for us since we had to catch our flight after lunch.

The lunch on M-F is $15.99 and dinner on M-Th is $23.99.  Friday seafood dinner and the weekend seafood brunch and dinner is $39.99.  With this price, included are several beers on tap, root beer on tap and a selection of wine.  Also, the price charged INCLUDED tax as well. 

We were promptly seated and the waiter came by and took our drink orders.  
They have an extensive selection of salads.  All the ones that I tried were fresh and delicious.

The carving station had tri-tip, turkey, ham and rotisserie chicken.  Tried the beef and ham and both were moist and very good. The crawfish, paella, and the steamed clams and mussels were good.  The BBQ ribs were tender.  From the Asian station, tried the kalbi ribs and oxtail soup were both delicious. The limited sushi selection was the only let-down.  The rice was on the hard side, which meant they have been sitting there for awhile.  

On to desserts.  They had an extensive selection of various cakes, cookies, flans, pies, cheesecakes, desserts in cups, custard balls, cannolis, macaroons and a very nice selection of sorbets\/gelatos.  Also, they have a coffee bar and you can get a cappuccino, latte, and mochas. 

Overall, this is a very good to excellent buffet.  For $15.99 for lunch with includes beer and wine and tax, it is a great value.  Since it is off the Strip, it was not crowed.  But I think once the word gets out, the crowds will be coming.  I would rate this buffet 4.5 stars.

Wish we had more time to enjoy more of the buffet.  But we will for sure make the Studio B Buffet a stop on our next visit to Vegas.",4,0,2

Weekday *Mon-Fri until 2:30pm* lunch prices are ridiculous.. a whopping $15 including beer and wine! FIFTEEEEEN DOLLARS! ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE! I felt that this was caps-worthy news.

They boast over 200 menu items available, and it was quite clear once we quickly entered the buffet after a short wait. The buffet line snakes around and includes all sorts of ethnic dishes.

Noteworthy:
-pasta salads and mixed salads (huuge variety!), eggplant parmesan, mac and cheese w\/ ham, tortellini!
-tri-tip, rotisserie chicken (super moist), meatloaf w\/ mushroom sauce, carne asada! YUM
-3 types of curry: green chicken curry, beef panang, and red seafood curry. They were all so flavorful and delicious! Better than some thai restaurants I've been to.
-chocolate crepe, fruit tart, cream puff, creme brulee, and cheesecake w\/ raspberry sauce were all delicious

Just so-so:
-chicken enchilada was salty
-fried chicken was good but greasy
-orange chicken and teriyaki chicken were okay
-macarons
-gelato.. not as good as I've had elsewhere

Drinks:
you have a good selection of beer, including Heineken on tap! We also had some raspberry cider, and wine choices.
At the dessert station there are made-to-order cappuccinos\/espressos\/lattes which you can add baileys or amaretto to! :)

We were also given raffle tickets for free buffets but didn't win :(
and the other catch was, there was no seafood (crab legs, oysters, etc) but only a seafood buffet on Friday nights for $30, which I would come back and try sometime! I would definitely have to say for $15 we were thoroughly satisfied and happy. Although this is not considered a gourmet buffet with fancy items, rather more simplistic items, the quality is not sacrificed at all.

Overall well deserved 4.5 star rating.",9,7,10

Only go here with low expectations, otherwise you will be dissapointed. The place has potential, but it just needs better quality control over everything. It has the variety, but not the quality.",0,1,0

We go at least once whenever we are in Vegas.  Even though the M Resort is off the strip, the line up for the buffet especially for the seafood buffet on weekend can be verrrrry long.  The food quality is top notch, except for the sushi.  I don't care for it since the sushi rice tends to be too cold.  The mac 'n cheese is one of my favorite dishes here though they tend not to serve it when they have the seafood buffet.  The prime rib is good too since if you are patient, you can get a medium rare piece but they disappear fast.  My last trip out I had the seafood buffet comp'd so I really indulged in the fresh oysters and the crab legs (which I am glad were not salty).

They have a really good assortment of desserts but my favorite is the ice cream counter. 

Service is generally really good to excellent most times we have been.  The wait staff works hard at clearing the tables and getting drinks.

Definitely recommend Studio B if you want to wander away from the strip.  M Resort also has some really fun slot machines to play before and after dinner - BONUS!",0,0,0

Snow crab legs on ice (YUM YUM YUM), oyster bar with all the trimmings, shrimp cocktail, mussels, clams, lamb chops (THE BEST THING HERE I MUST SAY) so tender and juicy, prime rib and oxtail ... need I say more? 

Dessert bar was great, cookies, tarts, shooters and best of all, a gelato bar ... ice cream on ice cream on ice cream ...

There was so much variety ranging from Italian, to Japanese, to Mexican, to American, to beer, to wine, to gelato, to cup cakes, to cookies, to macaroons.  There was just so much food, I couldn't eat it all.  I would say the best is the meat, but that's because I'm a guy and I like my protein.  There was so much desert, by the time I was half way done, my plate was full and I couldn't add anymore.  I got to the end (best part) where there was a ton of ice cream and gelato.  Great! Amazing!

Over all the buffet is okay, but a few things stand out which puts this buffet above others.

Snow crab halves - nice and tasty.. better yet find the Chinese food section and find the Garlic crab.  The pieces are smaller but the crabs are stir fried in chinese garlic sauce, way better.

Ox tail soup - Super tasty, among the best i've had, a nice star anise flavor to it.  It may look gross, but its only because it's so tender that a lot of the meat falls off of the bone.  The meat and cartilage are super soft and tender.  I could eat this all day and night.

When i had trouble in school spelling the words ""dessert"" and ""desert"" i was told this trick;  Dessert has 2 S's because you always go back for seconds.  This was totally the case here!  I'm usually disappointed with buffet desserts, they always LOOK good but when you bite in, its dry and tasteless.  This dessert station was hands down THE BEST!  about 14 or so different gelato's and sorbets (not store bought ice cream) my favs were nougat, chocolate, mango, strawberry.  
The flan was soft and supple, the creme brulee was among the best ive had, crispy crust of burnt sugar on top, and underneath was still creamy.  Chocolate cake was rich and velvety.  Macaroons were still warm!  Raspberry parfait was awesome.  As you can tell i went to town on the desserts!  I would have done more damage but i ate too much crab and main entree, had i known the desserts were this good i would have saved room.  Same quality if you were to order them individually at a dessert shop!

and lets not forget Wine and beer is included in all you can eat!  does it get any better?!

The forgettable stuff
Fried chicken, egg plant parmesan, bamboo mahi, adobo chicken.

Tips: Seafood buffet is only on the weekends and friday night.  When i came at around 3:30 there was no line, when i walked out at around 5 there was a line and a wait.  There is an expresso machine behind dessert counter and one of the dealers told me they can put alcohol in your coffee too!

SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT........ better yet, START with dessert!!",2,2,2
