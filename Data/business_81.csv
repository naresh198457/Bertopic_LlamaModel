Parking is easy whether you valet or self park. Check in is actually close to parking which is a big plus in a town where many casinos make you walk forever to get to anything. The elevators are also close to check in, another nice convenience. We checked in quickly and the staff was nice.

Our room was nice. They are good sized. You get a big bathroom, a good sized sleeping area and a big sitting area. The bathroom is nice. I appreciate that the toilet has its own door.

The sleeping area is nice. The beds are comfortable and there is plenty of drawers so you can unpack if you like. The sitting area is large. It includes a couch and a desk. The floor to ceiling windows give you nice views of the strip. The curtains are remote controlled which is convenient, as are the lights. It makes it easy to shut everything down at once when you are ready for bed.

Encore has a good sized casino floor. They were well staffed, so it was easy to find a seat at a table. They also have several great dining options from casual to fine dining. There are also some nice shops.

Our only issue was with the person restocking the mini bar. The cleaning staff did a good job of not bothering us when the do not disturb was up, but this guy ignored it two days in a row. Not a big deal, but an easy fix for them.

Check out was easy. I did it on the television and avoided the long line at check out.",10,4,6

The hotel was nice and clean and though the hotel has been open for a few years I did not see much wear and tear.  It's nice to be able to stay at a hotel that actually maintains their rooms.  The total experience was much more pleasant that my normal go to hotel of choice (Palazzo).  Encore's rooms were 100x better than what Aria offers and though I haven't stayed at Cosmo yet, I'd say Encore may be my new choice when stopping by Vegas.  What's also nice is that your room key also serves as your player's card so that I don't have to carry too many cards with me when gambling.  I haven't gambled at Wynn in a few years so naturally I've lost all my comps.  It was also nice to see a few craps tables with lower limits here along at Wynn.  Strolling back from dinner, you'll also see quite a view of the talent featured at their clubs ;-) which just an added bonus.  Will probably be back for another stay in the near future.",3,0,1

I liked the beauty of the resort, the understated sense of elegance and luxury.  The size is fantastic, not gigantic and overwhelming.  The suites are spacious, gorgeous with lots of high tech convenience.  So for the facility I would rate Encore 5 stars.
Unfortunately, the service I received while staying there truly left a sour taste in my mouth and I would not likely stay there again.  Why?
1.  At check-in, the woman working behind the counter neglected to inform us that we would be directly across from the XS lounge which starts blaring music from 10:30pm until 4am.  So even on the 19th floor, the music was disturbingly loud so that I couldn't sleep for the first 2 nights.  When I called down to the front desk to complain, they offered me ear plugs which I don't use.  If I had been informed about the noise from the XS lounge, I would have requested a room at the other side of the hotel.
2.  When we got to our room, we were relaxing on our bed and realized that the left side of the bed was completely saggy.  I called down to the front desk and instead of immediately telling me that they would switch my room or upgrade me, they said they would send housekeeping to change out the mattress.  WTH??  When housekeeping arrived, they said they could either put a board underneath the mattress or switch out the existing mattress for a new one. We chose to have a new mattress then had to leave our room for over 30 mins so that this could be done.  Major hassle.
3.  When we checked out, I spoke to the man working behind the counter and told him of the issues we had experienced during our stay.  I said that if the stay was perfect, I would not mind paying for the resort fee but as it was, I felt that it was a more than reasonable request to have the resort fee waived.  Esp. since I did not sign the agreement slip to pay for this fee during check-in.  The man would not agree to waive the resort fee and I asked to speak to the front desk manager.
4.  This is where my experience got even worse and left an even bigger bad taste in my mouth.  The front desk manager, Robert Cosko, did not agree to waive the resort fee.  Once again, I told him about the issues I had while staying at the Encore.  Without saying anything, he turned and went back to the back area of the front desk.  I waited at the front desk for 5~10 mins.  He came back and told me that there were no records that I had called about the mattress . . . like I was lying about this incident.  Which I didn't believe him anyway because I believe in a place like Wynn the would keep either phone or computer records of all conversations for liability concerns.  Then I had the sense that he was looking at me up and down, trying to gauge if I was a ""valuable' guest ie~ big spender worth being nice to.  Obviously, he decided that I was not because once again, he stated that the resort fee could not be waived.  This really made me mad since as we all know, high rollers are comp for everything at a casino resort and different charges and fees are waived all the time.

Since I did not agree to this fee upon check-in and I did not use the services that emcompasses the resort fee, I am challenging this charge on my credit card.

I met Steve Wynn once when he came to my school to speak (U of Penn, Wharton) and I liked him and know that he is a hard working man.  And he has certainly accomplished a lot in his lifetime.  Unfortunately, while his staff is well trained, their interaction with me was not friendly and warm and did not make me feel like a pampered, welcome guest.

I believe in service and am willing to pay for it.  In this instance, I did not receive any worth writing about hence the 2 stars.",4,1,1

Encore is also right across the street from Fashion Show mall, in case you need to do some shopping or get a last minute shirt for your trip.

I like their red decoration and the theme of butter flies throughout the hotel. 

The room is spacious and nice. We tried a few restaurants in the hotel, all of them were quite good, though on the pricey side. 

The casino is nicer than the other older casinos in town. The service at the casino was good. 

We also did spa during our stay. The spa was expensive, but it was really good. The facilities were well designed and incredible. The spa lobby was quite stunning. 

However, we had to wait in line pretty much everywhere, oh well, this is Vegas.

Check-in was a breeze since it was a Tuesday at 9pm. I tried the $20 trick, but the man told me he couldn't accept it because they were booked because of the MAGIC convention. But he was nice enough to offer me a panoramic suite on the 56th floor. The only downside? The view was of Circus Circus and the Las Vegas Hilton - the boring side of the strip.

Room was beautiful. My name was on the TV and phone. There was a TV in the bathroom (which I agree with others that I could've been in a better location), the bed was soft like a cloud, the TV spun, and the remote to control the lights and the curtains from the bed was amazing. 

I really liked how all the light switches were labeled and turned on all the lights in the room. I guess the rich don't need to waste time guessing which light switch controls what.

Housekeeping\/hotel staff was very nice on the phone. We asked for some toiletries and it was delivered in record time in a nice gift bag to take home. Also, they called me back asking if I received the shampoo\/soap. A+ service.

Pool was great! Being a weekday stay, there wasn't that many people, but I could see the place getting full on the weekends.

XS is one of the newer\/popular clubs in town, which is located at Encore.  I was pretty impressed with the place and although the main club isn't too big, the gigantic pool area more than makes up for it.  That's all I'll probably say about XS since the club warrants a review of its own.

The room was ok. Everyone else was thrilled with it. I thought the furniture looked like it was covered in shellac- so what if you have remote control drapes?  The decor reminded me of the apartment that Ray Liota's girlfriend had in Goodfellas. PLASTIC. The bathroom fixtures were nice though.

I too got pitched the players card at the Casino by a woman who said she would be back in 10 minutes after she got my info and NEVER came back. After hours of the damn card not working- I got $10.00 in free play. After several more hours on the machines, I earned 60 points which earned me nothing. The woman who gave me the card said I would get emails and text messages and up to 200 points just for signing up. None of that happened but at least they keep the drinks coming...for the most part.

The Wynn Encore did a decent job outfitting their cocktail waitresses in beaded skimpy dresses, (which also look cheap up close) but um HELLO where is the man candy?!!!!  It's time Steve Wynn wises up to the fact that women have money to spend in Las Vegas too-
so hire some cute cocktail waiters and bartenders and let us have our fun.

Botero was yet another overpriced Vegas steak joint where the difference between well, medium, well and medium rare is still confused and the waiter didn't ask how anything was until we were finished eating- didn't even bother to come by after the food was delivered and no, they weren't busy. My fifty dollar 8oz petite filet was something I could have gotten Outback except outback may have cooked it to order.
No thanks Wynn.

 I'll keep shopping around for my favorite Las Vegas hotel. The Wynn reminds me of a cheap pair of shoes- take a closer look and they scream, ""Made in China!",0,1,1

I havent stayed here as of yet but I have at The Wynn and I'm sure Encore being newer is just as top-notch as its predecessor. I did have a good friend that used to work here and she showed me around. I especially liked the pools including the european style pools. Yes, guests can go topless. No, it's not like going to the Playboy Mansion and what you would expect hanging out at Hef's infamous grotto. It was the middle of summer and it was mostly older folks. I didnt hang around long enough to be traumatized. I was fine with the other pools. They are immaculate and service is great. 

Surrender is located inside Encore and is a great layout for a club that attracts some of the most well-known DJs from all over the world. It's a big club with a big a space that includes the pools of Encore Beach Club.

Taxi line can be such a long wait here. Valet is efficient but their pick-up\/drop-off area is so congested and unclear that during the height of summer, it can be such a mess.

Of course, I haven't been able to stay at the Mansion at MGM like Tiger Woods, nor can I afford to blow 10K on expensive hookers (or even cheap hookers).

The all-suite Encore is a very spacious room with a living room that is semi-divided.  The decor is top notch and all drapes and lighting come automated.  Each room is equipped with a doorbell and electronic privacy and housekeeping button that you can set.  This avoids those annoying hang tags and prevents anyone from switching them from Do Not Disturb to Please Clean Room.  When I was little, I used to do it for fun.  I know, I was a naughty boy.

I would have liked to sit out by their beautiful pool, but my Beluga whale complexion would reflect a substantial amount of light,  blinding pilots trying to land at McCarran.

But unfortunately, since I'm Asian I don't get to see much of the room or enjoy it.  That's because I have the gambling gene which is a dominant gene in the Asian community.  The sound of gaming chips clacking together is like an aphrodisiac for me.  But I don't prescribe to all Asian stereotypes - I refuse to play Baccarat.  I always see Chinese people at the tables with a pen and note pad.  Looks like they are doing math - I think I will pass on this one.

In regards to gaming, Encore has a slight problem in making their gaming area a vibrant spot.  They do not offer a great selection of slot games and not a whole lot of variety in their table games. But, you can take a quick jaunt to the Wynn for better gaming action.",6,9,3

We checked in on a Saturday during the week of CES\/AVN. The reservation was for 2 Queen beds but by the time we got there, which was only 12pm, they did not have any available. So we were stuck with a King + Rollaway. The check in process here is noticeably longer than other hotels I've stayed at (Caesars, Bellagio, Palazzo, etc.). They also charged a temporary incidental fee of $150 to my credit card - I've never had to do this at ANY other Vegas hotel.

Went out until 3am and got back to our room but there was no rollaway in sight. We called housekeeping but our request was not in their system so they needed to verify with the front desk first... this took 30 minutes. Then they called us back and said we were eligible for a rollaway... but it took them another 30 minutes to deliver it.

Upon checkout the next morning we expressed our unpleasant experience to the concierge AND the hotel manager (Kyle Thomas), but all they said was ""we are extremely sorry, it won't happen again"".... Of course it won't happen again, because I'm never coming back!...

I even wrote an email and also sent a feedback form to corporate, but all that resulted in was an apology letter saying the same exact thing. That's three strikes.

I might have given them a better rating if they offered some type of comp (buffet vouchers, discount on next stay)... but they didn't so there goes my 1 star rating.

One other thing...the air is very dry and smokey. I woke up with a bloody nose! eek~",4,1,2

The decor throughout Encore was poppin' BRIGHT RED, but I didn't think it was too overpowering as some mentioned. Everything was very detailed from the floor to the ceiling, similar to Wynn! The staff was also friendly, willing to open the door with a greeting and welcoming smile.

Unfortunately for me, it was too damn HOT and my sensitive skin couldn't tolerate the 115 degree HEAT sooo I didn't fully experience the outdoor pool so much..BUUUT I did have an unforgettable time @ their Club, XS (check on my review).

- Self-parking is a stone's throw from the entrance. Easy.

Cons:

 -They started charging for parking, and parking is not comped if you stay at the hotel. One thing that made the Wynn\/Encore unique was that it didn't charge for parking; I really dislike nickel-and-diming as it changes the experience.
- Encore has a very specific demographic, and they do not have any affordable dining options on property. (No food courts or Secret Pizza, for example.)

Most people expect Encore to be like the Wynn but better, and in many ways it is.  The hotel is nicer than the Wynn, the rooms are a bit larger and the bathrooms are very luxurious.  The pool has two full service bars and you can play the card tables poolside.  The European pool also doubles as part of the newest and hottest club in Vegas, XS, the cabanas are used as VIP Tables.

Unfortunately there are no restaurants in Encore, you have to venture off to the Wynn for food service.  The casino part of Encore, however, is smaller and the card tables and slots are spaced out further than Wynn.  It's designed like that on purpose for an intimate feel, a place to take your wife and enjoy a more serene atmosphere.  The complimentary cocktails while gambling usually come pretty fast.

Overall, I had a blast staying at Encore.  I think we got a great deal on hotel rates and the minimum bets were pretty reasonable.  I would stay at Encore again because the staff is very friendly, polite, and they do a great job at listening to the customers if something were to go awry.",3,0,1

The staff at the Encore and the Wynn are truly exemplary, going out of their way at every juncture to accommodate their guests. 

Yes, it is expensive. And yes, it is worth it. 

My room was what I believe to be a standard King suite, but happened to be extremely spacious and tastefully decorated with a stunning view of the Strip. I had a desk and a living area on the other side of the TV console. The bathroom is gorgeous, with dual sinks, a tub, and  amazing water pressure in the shower. 

The resort itself has everything you could possibly envision needing or wanting in the city of Las Vegas: a huge casino, numerous restaurants of varying cuisines, shows, shopping, awesome clubs, a lovely spa, pools, etc. I didn't leave the Encore\/Wynn to venture out into the world for three days straight. 

I have two small complaints, neither of which are egregious enough to knock down the five-star rating: 

1.) Steve. Dude. Hook a sister up with a Keurig in the room. This is Vegas. Nobody wants to leave their room first thing in the morning to get that essential nectar of life, and even I have no intention of paying $14 for two small cups of coffee via room service. Help us caffeine addicts out and allow us to make a cup of coffee in the room before having to interface with humanity. 
2.) The location at the north end of the Strip is a bit remote. Once we did decide to venture beyond the enclave of the Encore\/Wynn, getting to where the action is on the Strip is a bit inconvenient and expensive. I suppose the relative seclusion of this resort is an asset for those who are looking for a respite from the insanity of the mid- and lower Strip, but I didn't particularly enjoy having to take a $20 cab ride every time I wanted to visit another attraction in town. 

My only MAJOR complaint against this hotel is its proximity to the Trump hotel. I had a hideous view of that tacky gold monument to his insecurity and it made me nauseous.",3,3,0

2. Room is definitely something I could get used to. Clean, modern, nice tub, tv in the bathroom, swiveling flat screen in the bedroom and the other chill area. 
3. The room service was very good. The food was probably cheaper than a lot of the restaurants in Encore\/Wynn, and good portions. Had the mac and cheese which could serve like 4-6 people, and the sliders, yum. 
4. It's got a safe in the room. Is this standard now for Vegas? 
5. XS and Surrender are there. 
6. THE fastest internet connection I've ever used anywhere. I think I downloaded a song in well under ten seconds. Good place to get work done before play.

8. The bedding is effing nice. 
9. Floor to ceiling windows make an awesome view. Can close the drapes automatically at your bedside.

2. Not a whole lot within walking distance, the mall across the street is like any mall in any city, nothing special, the next casino after encore to wynn is the Palazzo then Venetian. 
3. Some dude opened our door without knocking or ringing the door. I mean he definitely worked  for Encore but I wasn't sure what he was doing.

The decor is beautiful and elegant and the rooms are very bright and spacious.  There is a separate couch area to relax instead of just a bed and bathroom like most hotels.  The bathroom has two sinks, a tub and shower.  They also provide comfortable bathrobes and bath slippers.  We were on the 57th floor and had a gorgeous view of the Wynn golf course.   This hotel is perfect for my Mom since she doesn't gamble and likes to relax in the room after a long day of shopping.

The service is exceptional.  Front desk and concierge are always helpful and friendly.  We got in a few hours before check in time and front desk let us check in early with no problem!  We were thrilled!  We stayed for the World of Concrete expo; concierge made severals calls, helped us find the shuttle route and even printed us a schedule to take with us.  Our pillows were a little flat so we called housekeeping and they immediately brought us new fluffy pillows.  The pillows are so comfortable that we went downstairs to the home store and bought our own to take home with us.  They rolled them up really tight so they fit into my carry on with no problem.

The structure and making of the room is nothing but elegance and topped with tech savvy goodies -of course to your convenience.

The rooms or this hotel gives off the modernistic feeling. All your lighting and shades are controlled by a remote that is next to your bed. Even your entrance and signs are techy. No more ""do not disturb signs"" because all you have to do is press a button and the message shows up on the other side of the door. And you even have a doorbell. 

I think all they have are suites, but of course the suites come in levels. You want to live like a king or queen check out the tower suites.

Enough about the rooms. The lobby has a garden. There's a inside walk-way that connects The Encore and Wynn Hotel by lining it with stores and shops.

Although if you're there to gamble- which is definite- the casino in Encore is pretty small so you might have to hike into The Wynn to gamble. They have more table games if that's what you are looking for. Encore has tables but mostly slots.

Result: I will definitely go back!!!",1,0,1

Encore is a beautiful hotel. The furnishings are tasteful, even by gaudy Vegas standards. It looks very nice. The casino and shops have much the same feel as The Wynn: upscale, well thought out, and polished.

The rooms are all suites, also very attractive, with a very upscale and modern feel. The bathrooms are spacious, double sinks, separate shower stall and deep tub, a small television, and I suspect radiant heat in the marble floors (though I'm not sure about that). The beds are big and puffy. The living section of the room has a nice couch and  desk. The large flatscreen tv swivels so you can watch it both in bed and from the couch. The front of the room is all glass and looks out onto either The Strip or the old strip. The spa is absolutely magnificent.

Sounds pretty good, right? Well if that was all there is I would think so, too, but we won't be returning to Encore and here's why:

Location: Encore is technically on The Strip, but it is also waaaaay on the end of the strip. If you don't plan on going anywhere then this shouldn't be an issue, but, let's face it, part of the fun of Vegas is walking down the strip, visiting other hotels, and watching the human freakshow. It's harder to do this at Encore than at other hotels. The closest hotel is Wynn, and after that is Palazzo and Treasure Island, a solid 10-15 min walk at a good pace. Belaggio is at least a 30-40 min walk at a very fast pace.  Complicating things is that if you want to catch a cab and avoid a very long walk you are going to have a hard time catching one from Encore. Cabs go there infrequently during peak times because, as one cabbie told us, taking their fares back toward the other hotels on the strip is a pain because there is no place for them to turn around; when a cab leaves Encore it can't go straight to the other hotels - it has to travel all the way up Las Vegas Boulevard in the opposite direction to Circus Circus Hotel to find a place to turn around. As a result cabs try to avoid Encore. If you have tickets to a show you might get lucky and get a cab right away, or you might also end up waiting 20-30 min in a line just 10 parties deep, desperately hoping that a cab shows up. The cab line at Wynn is a bit better, but trust me when I say that the walk to Wynn from Encore gets very old very fast.

Ventilation:
The casino at Encore is very smokey. Maybe they were still calibrating their ventilation system when we were there, or maybe we were just unlucky, but the casino was noticeably smokier than Wynn's and on the order of one of the cheaper hotels.  After a night in the casino, the next morning my throat was raw and sore. Another guest we met in the elevator said that he and his wife were also having some difficulty with the Encore ventilation and had met other people who were also displeased, We solved the issue by gambling at Wynn or other hotels.

Oh, and the windows in the Encore hotel rooms do not open, so if you want *any* fresh air in your room you are out of luck.  This might not be a big deal to some people, but if it is important to you that you get to breathe non-recycled air then carefully consider this.  Our room was still off-gassing new construction\/carpet\/furniture fumes and we missed the fresh air. I developed a sore and scratchy throat that disappeared whenever I was out of Encore for more than about an hour, and would faithfully return shortly after we got back.

Service:
Much to their credit the hotel operators have set up the hotel to run smoothly. Things worked fairly well for a hotel that, when we visited, had only been open for a about a week. This is no small feat. The bellhop staff is top-notch.

But in my book careful planning only gets you three stars.  We had very significant issues during our stay, some of which the hotel addressed, and some they didn't (incomplete room with construction materials, unresponsive security to a large room party at 4:00a.m., etc).  The Encore staff are very nice, but a funny thing happens when something goes wrong. They seem paralyzed, as though then never imagined that with all their careful planning anything could go wrong. They genuinely seem shocked.  This, in my mind, is what separates a four-star hotel from a five-star hotel: taking care of the issues that will inevitably arise in a competent and straightforward manner. Encore still has a very long way to go.

To recap: pretty hotel and nice staff, but disorganized under the surface and definitely not 5 stars. But even if they fix the service issues, they still have problems with ventilation and location that can't be addressed so easily. We won't be returning.",3,0,1

However, it is a casino and as such you have the typical Vegas elements in the hotel as well, which gets annoying. It is nice that they make sure that only people get to the elevator that have a valid room key, but you can still spot prostitutes and dealers getting through. 

It is fun to watch people here, play pool (one pool table, Steve Wynn's personal pool table from his Manhattan apartment as I was told) and have some drinks. It is very expensive to have room service. I paid $97 for some granola, yogurt and a very small omelet and smoothie.

The restaurants are nice as well, I ate at the Sinatra and Andrea's, will leave a review for both. But I don't necessarily agree with the hype around Las Vegas restaurants. You see ads everywhere that they are worldclass, but I couldn't go that far.

From the beautiful design of Encore and Wynn buildings to the top notch customer service I've always received, you know it's going to be a memorable experience. And not to mention that after all these years and attempts by the next hot new club, XS and Encore Beach Club (and maybe Tryst and Surrender too) are almost always on every EDM-loving, thirsty (and maybe even starving) party people's agenda for the weekend. No other clubs really come close to how well thought-out and truly fun these venues are (they also bring out the best DJs IMO). The convenience of being able to just walk up to your room instead of being stuck in those atrocious post-club closing taxi lines... yup, it's worth it. By the time your non-guest friend gets back to their hotel, you're already in your bathrobe devouring the outrageously expensive room service you just drunkenly ordered.
 
Now back to the hotel.. always always try to get the highest floor possible, yes, it's worth the extra upgrade money and yes, you should always do it. And you want it to be strip-facing, because that guarantees you a nice view of XS and EBC right underneath you (since you'll be facing Wynn and the clubs are between the two hotels), as well as a partial view of the golf course (maybe not always) and it's much better than the construction you'd see facing the other side of the strip. But you will definitely see\/hear the party at night, which I don't mind at all because you should be contributing to the noise and not complaining about it anyway!
 
The beds are very comfy, quality bed sets and fluffy pillows. And I especially love that I can close the curtains and block out the sneaky sun with a touch of a button when I return to my room at ungodly hours. That's all the essentials of a good Vegas hotel room. I also really love their bathrooms, strong shower heads with a nice big tub, a double sink, a separate sitting room complete with a couch and desk, lots of room for you to pamper yourself and get ready for a night out.
 
And take advantage of the hotel grounds, there's tons of great food and fun things to do. Wynn buffet, SW Steak house, cafes, golf course, casinos, shops, spas & fitness center and at least two other pools accessible to all Encore\/Wynn guests (that's separate from their cover-charging pool party).
 
Having Tacos El Gordo right next to the hotel used to be an added bonus as well (moment of silence for their closing...) but stay here! Family or couple or a large party sneaking into a double bed room, you won't regret it. You did well, Mr. Wynn!",3,0,1

The hotel when you first walk in is gorgeous! I love the red, Asian theme they had. The butterflies on the ceiling were beautiful and the garden area in the middle of the hotel was amazing!

They staff was courteous and they did everything they could to make you happy. They pretty much said YES to all your requests. My initial reservation was a resort suite, nonsmoking. But when my party and I got there, they ran out of nonsmoking rooms. So they gave us the smoking room. We didn't care, we were OK with it. The only other bad thing with the fron desk was that they did not explain what the ""resort fee"" was or what it entailed. 

The sad part was we didn't get to check out the club Surrender or XS but that was our fault because we arrived in Vegas late. However the buffet at the Wynn made up for it. The food was SO good my food coma nap was at least 2 hours long. 

At the spa, you have the privilege or working out in the gym and the staff there was just as great as everywhere else in the hotel. If you ran out water while running, someone will come by and bring you a new water bottle! Lol

It missed the 5 star mark with me due to the small size of the casino, and for it's location.  It's a little far down on the strip so getting to the center of things takes some planning.

But my review is mostly about the room.  The tackiness has been left downstairs; in the room it's all about clean lines, open space and comfort. 

The bed was a dream, the view of the golf course was gorgeous, the pool below was lovely, the soaking tub was ahhhh, the shower had a standard head plus an additional nozzle, the towels were good size, the toiletries were decent and did I mention the bed? Hahaha...Oh man, I could have laid around in it my entire vacation.

The ""resort suite"" doesn't have 2 distinct rooms; it's more like a seating\/work area with partial wall separating it from the bed.  It was fine though.  Plus they put the swivel flat panel TV between the areas so it worked well.  We didn't have a ton of clothes but there would have been plenty of drawer and closet space if we'd brought more.

The mini bar was pretty typical and yes, on several occasions we dipped into it.  We brought our own water and snacks but next time I'm going to bring my own booze as well.  Sometimes you get back to your room, want one more drink but just don't feel like dragging yourself back downstairs to get one.  This is what they bank on.

Room service was better than expected.  The food arrived quickly and maintained both taste and temp.  The only issue my boyfriend had was that his burger arrived overcooked.

Oh and you might want to bring your own TP....theirs was kind of rough.  I didn't expect that...

The food in Encore was great (see my other reviews), service was pleasant and the staff was very helpful during resaervations and quick to answer email questions before our trip.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is room price.  I think  that even though it's a great resort with delicious restaurants and nice rooms, the price per night is still on the pricey side.  

That being said, if I got another good deal like the last one (3 nights in a resort suite, 2 free show tix & $25 free slot play for $300), I'd stay again.",5,2,2

My friends and I stayed at The Mirage but stopped here just to check out the casino and play some slots. It was March Madness weekend so all of the TVs were showing the games. After playing a bit, I decided to watch some basketball. All the seats at one bar were taken, and there was another bar that was closed next to it that also had TVs with the game on. So, naturally, a few of us bar patrons bought a drink at one bar, then sat at the closed bar area just to watch the game. 

Now, this bar is not a closed space. It's just a counter with chairs along a casino walkway. So, many people who walked through stopped periodically to watch the game. Soon, bar staff walked behind the counter and said nothing to us as we watched, and we didn't bother them. Then a security guard comes by and says that since the bar is closed, we can't sit at the counter and have to leave. Yes, his exact words were ""You have to leave."" Mind you, we were all paying customers with drinks on hand. We weren't yelling or screaming. We were all actually pretty quiet enjoying the game. He stayed there until everyone picked up their drink in amazement and began to leave.

If we were loud, or brought in outside food, or took up space that other paying customers needed, I'd understand. But hell, we bought drinks at the bar next door which had no empty seats left. And the seats at this bar weren't being used. Even the bar workers didn't care we sat there.

I got similar treatment watching some of the card games. I got rude dealers asking, ""Well are you going to play?"" This place just cares about taking your money and places zero premium on customer service. I would never stay here even if they comped me a room.",3,0,0

You even make Wynn's rooms look shabby and that's a pretty hard feat in itself.  The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, though it does go a littler overboard with the reds.  The rooms are super spacious and could sleep 6 comfortably if 2 people sleep on the couch - it could probably sleep up to 10 if everyone else crashes on the floor. =)  The bathroom is really nice too with double sinks, separate bathtub and shower and a mini-tv too.  I think the best feature of the room is the controls on the nightstand, you never have to get up to do anything!  With the click of a button, I could control the blinds\/curtains, lights, the privacy button... everything!

My only negative experience at this hotel was due to a slight scuffle during check in due to one of the front desk clerks being incompetent.  I arrived at the hotel around 12 and pre-registered since check in wasn't till 3 and everything went accordingly.  The lady even took my cell # so she could call me if my room was ready before hand.  I didn't get a phone call, so I just figured I'd check in at 3 like I was suppose to.  I waited in line and was helped by Judith.  I told her I pre-registerd at noon and requested 2 queens with the previous person but was told the room wasn't available yet.  She looked up my reservation and told me that there is no record in the system that I pre-registered and that there were now no rooms with 2 queens available at all!  She told me the only room she could give me a king and a roll-a-way. I asked if there would be any chance a room with 2 queens would become available and she told me no, but I could wait and check back later if I'd like.  I left to check with my friends given the situation and later went back and spoke with Bryan, who I believe was one of the front desk managers.  I explained my situation to him and told him that I understood the beds were a request, but the fact that they had no record I pre-registered at noon was ridiculous since they had 2 queens available then.  He told me he'll check on my reservation for me, and came back 10 mins later with my room available and ready! =)  So Bryan from front desk, you totally made my experience at Encore and gets 5-stars for your customer service!  If it wasn't for my check in experience, I would have easily given Encore 5-stars.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to stay at other hotels now since Encore pretty much ruined all other Vegas hotels for me.  So if you find a good deal for Encore, I'd definitely say go for it!  Personally, I believe Encore is worth every dollar and will definitely be back!",1,0,0

I had a great time at Encore for Labor Day weekend but as a backdrop to a vacation there are better options. For reference, my top priorities for a trip to vegas are 1.) Party 2.) Get ready to party in a comfortable environment 3.) Food to fuel party time: fine dining + casual.

The lobby decor was an assault on my eyes. Seriously, it's just awful. Butterflies and dragonflies were the theme here, scrawled over the carpets and in huge glittery formations on the walls. Red was the statement color. Between the dragonflies and the red, it seems likely that Steve Wynn was going for an Eastern theme but it ended up looking garish. 

The panoramic suite was huge, which is a major plus when you're sharing it with four girls. In fact, I thought that it was the best thing about Encore. There's tons of room to spread out makeup, clothes, hair tools, and whatever else you bring. The security locker was really small-- not a box like most hotels but a slim cabinet that had trouble fitting two iPads and five wallets. The contents of the locker came tumbling out every time it was opened. There was a standard display of snacks and a ""lovemaking kit"" available for a charge if removed for more than 60 seconds, but even the refrigerator was off limits. You can't store leftovers or drinks in there for any amount of time because it's also weight-sensitive. I thought that was pretty cheap. The room was adequately clean and well-stocked but not pristine... there was gold paint chipping off the mirrors and the tops of some surfaces had collected dust. 

It seemed like there aren't as many casual restaurants at Encore as there are at other hotels. The closest place to pick up a sandwich is at a cafe at the Wynn. My party did check out Botero. My petite filet was cooked to a perfect medium-rare but the flavor of the meat wasn't noteworthy, especially compared to the Chicago steakhouses I'm used to. I did love the three sauces that came alongside it. I had a bite of my friend's ribeye and it was definitely better. We ordered a lot of side dishes-- mushrooms, corn cakes, mashed potatoes, tater nuggets-- and they were all tasty. 

I will note that the dayclub music was very audible from the room. Our room was located on the 31st floor, overlooking the pools and the music started around 11 am. 

For the club scene, we checked out Encore Beach Club two days in a row. The guest list, even on a holiday weekend, was really short. And I loved that they had free water jugs and cups for those waiting in line. Take note, Daylight (even though I had more fun at that club). Drinks and food were super expensive, but that's to be expected. I think a watermelon mojito was $18. Pitchers were $90. Two orders of chicken tenders and fries, a Caesar salad, and a Coke came to $59. Oh, Vegas. I've been to Surrender before and wouldn't return. Most of the club is outdoors with only a small indoor space that houses the DJ. And of course there's XS, which is fun but it seems to get even more dangerously packed than other Vegas clubs.

I'm staying at Cosmo next time.",0,0,2

Btw, Nguyen is pronounced New+Ehn and NOT Wynn nor Shar+Day.The Vietnamese language has only has one syllable words, combined with heavy accents makes it sound like new+in. Thus misinterprited as win (wrong). Just say NO to Pho, dodo! 

Moreover, it's catered to A younger crowd with the beach club, then the Wynn is with an extravegant lobby mall and golf course. The beach club is nice but low woo girl to male ratio. Keep your hands off the mini bar. An floor upgrade for the view isn't worth it but for noise maybe.",1,1,1

The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful.  That includes our initial call for reservations, calling the front desk with in-room questions, and all the other hotel interaction we had.  We booked a King Suite... initially they had problems when we checked in trying to locate an available room to match our reservation.  I thought this was odd but the front desk seemed confident they could figure it out and they did within about 10 minutes.  I didn't mind the wait and it helped that they were apologetic about it.  I didn't seem like a number, even though I really was for such a huge property.  The room was great.  Remote lights, blinds; TV in the bathroom; swivel big screen covers the living room and bedroom.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've experienced.  The gym was ok... we liked the one we went to at the Palazzo next door on one day so I think we were comparing it a lot.  I did like that the gym was in the spa area and the bathroom facilities were unreal.  I think one of the biggest reasons I can't give this place a 5 is simply the location.  Its at the end of the strip and a bit far from many attractions.  Not that its so bad... there is plenty to do in the hotel and the immediate area.  I just would have liked to be more central.  I would definately stay again.  But if I found similar deals and had to choose between say the Bellagio and Encore, I would probably just stay at the Bellagio based on location.",0,0,0

Wifi worked fine for us and was included in the resort fee, though you have to click through some web forms that tell you as much.  There is no floor 40 - 49 so it's not as quite high as it sounds, though still an awesome view North to downtown and the mountains.  The view seemed to put my lovely date into a very romantic mood, so good times were had - and the room mirrors seemed to multiply the visual pleasures.  We turned in well after midnight but heard no club thump at our level\/side though I knew in advance that the party was on with Diplo spinning.  The gym room was nice and big, open 6A to 8P.  Heavy on machines and treadmills but still enough room and apparatus (free weights, kettles, bands, balls, etc.) to train strength and functional stuff with my trainer\/wife, so that experience worked out well.  We didn't see all of the resort in our two night stay, but what I did see, I liked and there was a lot to look at.  The giant hanging fresh flower balls in the atrium were impressive and demanded photos be taken.  Wazuzu food sucked in my opinion and sundries store items were crazy money expensive but those are minor complaints.  Society cafe breakfast was excellent by contrast, though not cheap.  I also dug the Alexander McQueen shop at Wynn with the stylee skull themed gear - though I could barely afford an accessory there, I wanted to buy more.  The resort location rocked, close to the classier end of the strip, adjacent to the Fashion show and Palazzo.  I didn't drop a penny at the casino, but witnessed many other people appearing to enjoy that side of it.  Consensus is that we had a great time on our short stay.",0,0,0

This time I checked out Encore, and this time it was for fun.
A well appointed 745 sq ft room.  I love the flat panel tv in the bathroom.

The large flat panel in the room swivels, so you can watch from the bed or the sitting area.
I could not find the remote for the curtains.  I asked about it at checkout, and was told there's a console that controls the curtains, tv volume.  I just didn't see a console, in three nights stay.

The Wynn resort is a class act.  They keep everything up in tip top shape.  From the parking structure, to the entrance from the structure.  This, not the valet area, is where a hotel shows its true colors.

What I really didn't like was the blonde older woman at the ticket desk where I picked up my Le Reve tickets.  She was snobby, unfriendly, unhelpful, she made me feel like I was a bother. She should not be anywhere near the hospitality business.  She was horrible.

The Wynn needs to have a better variety of food options.  More casual dining, an excellent bakery, better high end restaurants.  Also, it was a nice convenience that the Lobby Bar at Encore (directly next to the guest elevators) serves coffee, tea, and pastries in the mornings.  But the tea was $6.  $6 for hot water and a tea bag.  That's a little over the top in the rip off department.

But I love the Wynn.  I love all the big flowers in the carpet and decor, it's my favorite decor of all the hotels on the strip.  And I love that everything is immaculate.  Even the slot machines area, everything is clean and tidy.  Everyone, except for that horrid ticket lady, was friendly and helpful, particularly the woman who checked us in.

P.s.  I requested a room with a view of the strip.  We got a room on the 27th floor.  I was advised that you can hear the club (Surrender or XS, one of them) from the room.  I kind of didn't believe it.  Boy was I wrong.  I could hear the bass all the way up there.  But we liked the view, so instead of changing rooms, I just drank heavily at night. Ha.",3,4,1

I chose to stay at this hotel because of this. Further more, our stay during weekdays are generally better since it has less patrons and visitors that smoke. However, there are a few things that caught my attentions:

1) in room towels are super hard. Towels that my pets use are softer and better than theirs. I was glad I brought my own towels for my 5 months old baby.
2) resort fee only entitle WIFI connections for 2 devices per room. Imagine traveling with kids that has multiple ipads\/iphones.
3) shower was pretty bad compared to other newer hotels on the strip. No matter how you adjust the shower pattern, you can almost expect a constant flow of stream, instead of ""shower"". Also lack of water pressures.
4) So called suite only has 1 TV per room (rotate 360 degrees between bedroom and a small sofa area). Venetian\/Venezia\/Palazzo and The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay has 2 TVs in each guest suite.
5) Limited free TV channels compared to other newer hotels on the strip. I did not even bothered to try to search for any channels to watch. I brought my own HDMI cable and connected my iPad to watch my own programmings.
6) Poorly designed AC systems ventilation. AC in living area can be blasting cold but the bedroom area remains warm.. You will notice the difference when walking from bed room area to the living room area, which is only about 2-3 steps away.

On the bright side, it is a very nice hotel with a lot of luxury decorations. Certainly one of the best of LV. Loved the buffet with sparkling wine add on if you love to drink. If they can address all the issues above, I will certainly come back for my future stays.",0,1,0

However, there's just something lacking. If you stay at Encore, you have to keep walking over to the Wynn anyway - all of the casual dining options are over there, and they have a larger casino that just feels more upbeat. 

I guess the best way to put it is this: Encore is great as an attachment to the Wynn, but it couldn't stand alone as its own hotel and casino. 

Side Note: They're good about safety! I lost my room key somewhere in the casino, and the rest of my group had left the hotel to watch a show elsewhere. Because the reservation wasn't under my name, the guy at the front desk wouldn't issue another room key for me. It made sense, so I didn't complain...but damn!

- At night you need a room key to get pass the guard at the elevators
- Pools are clean and not over crowded

- Access to several clubs between Encore and Wynn
- Great room comps
- Great decor and service

I explained I appreciated the offer.

A couple days after we returned home I saw 2 voicemails on my phone. It was someone from Encore that was concerned with our review. I was quite surprised that such a large Co would take the time to make sure one of their guests was satisfied.

I expressed my concerns about the noise and they seamed genuinely concerned and apologetic. I always say the way to judge a Co is how they handle a problem. Any Co can deliver what they are paid to do but it takes a better Co to go that extra step and make sure an unsatisfied customer stays a customer.

They did threaten to bury me in the desert but I think they were joking? (only kidding!!) 

We stayed at MGM do the pool for our kids and I will tell you the difference is night and day between the 2 hotels. The MGM does not come anywhere near the Encore in decor, service and accommodations. We weren't there 2 minutes when we both turned to each other and say; ""Why didn't we stay at the Encore"". By the way the big complaint you read is the Encore's location. If you look closely you will notice it is actually located better then MGM as it is closer to the nicer and newer hotels.

I have stayed at the Wynn properties for the last 7 years every year around Christmas. Normally we have a great time and everyone is top notch that works there. That brings me to 2016. We pull up to the valet area and it is now $18 per day. We are told that the Encore is the last property to go to daily valet charges on the strip. I asked the valet if this killed his tips and he said, 'destroyed them'. Upon check in we asked to back out of valet and she helped by telling us we could move our car. We were also told the buffet was out of service for the holidays, so we would get a $150 credit for food we ate at the hotel. Upon check out we did not see a $150 line item credit as you would think you would. We ate over $500 in food so we easily covered the $150. The front desk employee advised that he had just adjusted out the last $1.75 to get to $150. I asked what he meant. He said that the $150 was deducted over the course of the stay. Why? He said 'that is the way the system does it'. Ok I call BS. Why not just deduct the first $150 you spend or show a credit on the bill for $150? Very shady. How many people assume the credit was given and never check? That's not the Wynn I know, and I guarantee the boss would not like this at all. All the while, the front desk guy was snippy. Why get snippy with me? I'm just trying to figure out what shady accounting was going on. Then we go to the valet to load our car up with bags. The head valet gives our baggage ticket to the junior employee that loaded our car and tells her 'here, enjoy'. We did not valet because it's now $18 per day that we could be and did spend on gambling. Now we are second class citizens because we did not want to spend $54 to park the car plus tips??

Bravo, Steve Wynn.  They say that everything you do turns to gold.  I think this holds true to your much anticipated Encore resort.  The line to getting into this last night was even worse than a new Disneyland ride but it was well worth the wait. 

The boyfriend and I wanted to be one of the firsts to step inside a casino before the infestation of smoke.  It was strange being inside a Vegas establishment and not feeling like you needed to dry clean your clothes the next day :)

Supposedly one of the ""best"" hotels in the world, it really does live up pretty close to it's name, but it is still a ""large-scale"" luxury resort that still leaves many customer aspects to be desired.

Check-in is an absolute ZOO.  In the afternoon the lines are 10-15 people deep.  There are separated lines so if you get one good complainer, don't expect to see your room keys for the next hour.  Check-out is exactly the same way, please use express check out if you can.  In my case, our stay and dining were comped, so we had to wait in line in order to check our bill to make sure it was clear.  I got lucky and waited in the right lines while a lady behind me waited for an hour.  Most resorts have double or triple the amount of counters, but the hotel tries to get away with 10 or so counters (possibly trying to show off the fact that it's a more ""private and intimate"" experience.

Turndown service must be requested.  It didn't use to be this way, but the recession hit Vegas pretty hard.  Turndown service is a hallmark of REAL 5-star hotels and to have it requested (and you have to ask before you figure it out - or go one night without it).  When asked, they did it one night but did not do it the other.  

The room was nice enough and the hotel was completely full.  We were unable to get a complimentary upgrade because of the full hotel, but no upgrade needed.  The room itself is definitely of 5-star quality, with the normal Encore Resort Rooms being 700 sq ft of luxury, high quality linens and furniture and a very large and opulent bathroom.  Mirrored walls and heavy doors with VERY GOOD sound insulation was nice to have.  Small TV in the bathroom and large one split between the living room and bedroom.  Large floor to ceiling windows with automated shades rounded out the rest of the room.  Any request for extras was taken quickly and delivered efficiently. 

The pool is wonderful, absolutely stunning.  The walk from the pool\/spa level and then the elevator down to the outside was spectacular.  A wonderful Italian church-like environment for the gym and spa, which was a complete surprise.  There is only one hot tub in the European pool area (topless) with two large pools.  On the day that it was sunny, the area was completely full and renting daybeds or cabanas was the only way to be by the pool.  We spent 2 hours after the buffet sleeping and tanning at the pool area; there is also a security guard there to keep the gawking rabble out.

Restaurants are top notch here, look for the ""Taste of Wynn"" menus that seem to be more of a value and offer at least 3 courses.  We ate at Tableau, Society Cafe and the Wynn Champagne Buffet.

The valet is slow, don't expect to show up at the kiosk and get your car right away.  Expect a 10-15 minute delay.  For some reason, there aren't many efficient runners.  If you're smart, call down 10-15 minutes in advance and have it taken out.  Don't waste your time.  Valet is free, like most other hotels on the strip.

I have only 4 stars because of the check-in and check-out as well as the turndown service.  If the hotel really wants to make a good impression, it really needs to overhaul the process.  At least at real 5 star hotels, I get personalized service at check-in and out.  

Go for the Tower Suites (much less crowded) if you have the extra cash.  More personalized valet and check-in and check-out (and nicer bathrooms).  Also as an added bonus, Tableau is right there next to the elevators for a GREAT meal.",1,0,0

As soon as you walk through the doors it smells fantastic (piping in tahitian vanilla) and then the flowers - TO DIE for.  The lobby is beautiful. The butterflies everywhere are so amazing.  Every detail has been thought about.  There is something to be said for a man who has OCD and a bottomless pit of money.  He knows how to make a hotel work like a Cartier mystery clock.

I love that it doesn't really smell like smoke even though you can smoke in the casino.  I hate smoking.  Bad for you.  Smell worse.  It doesn't smell in Mr. Wynn's joint.  Bonus points for him.

The places to shop here...sweet!  Cartier is always on my list of ""yes I'll take that please"" but wait until your back is turned so I can run out the door with it.  Manolo, Cartier, Chanel, Dior...just to name a few.  If you've forgotten everything but your credit card number...you'll be fine as long as you can afford it.  I ""accidentally"" got lost on the way back from the pool I was at in the Wynn...and I think I left drool marks on the glass at some of the stores.  Classy no.  Necessary...no.  But a girl can dream, right?

We were in one of the regular suites and it was perfect.  We stayed on the 28th floor and could see the pools.  The only drawback is you can hear the nightclubs at night because the music is pretty loud.  

We didn't make it into Tryst or XS or Surrender...man those places were crowded!  And the women dress like beaver city.  I swear I saw more Asian beaver than you see in a cheap massage parlor.  Clean it up ladies, nobody wants to see your beev.

The service in the hotel was lovely.  We left our ""do not disturb"" light on accidentally all day and came back to an unmade bed.  We took it off for dinner and it was all better within an hour.  Bonus!!

The pools here are amazing.  The adult pool is great.  You can sit out there with your top off and not feel embarassed.  There was some pervy dude out there with his iphone trying to take pictures.  He got yelled at.  That's not allowed.  And that's sooooo tacky.  Who wants to take pics of tits???  As if you haven't seen them before...gross.

The grill down at the pool makes GREAT sammies.  Get one.  I had a turkey on sourdough with basil pesto, lettuce, onion and avocado.  Sounds strange, but I promise you won't be disappointed.

the hotel is located across the fashion mall, treasure island, and venetian\/palazzo. it's at the end of the strip... the advantage... no traffic!!! it only takes about 30 - 40 mins to walk the whole strip (one-way) good exercise!!!

SERVICE IS GREAT!!! this is one of the priciest places to stay in Las Vegas but if you ever receive complimentary room offers... better take advantage (like i did for our 3-night stay) because it's $299+ a night! AND AN HONEST ADVICE... Encore IS MORE LIKE FOR ADULTS. I DIDNT REALLY FIND ANYTHING ENTERTAINING FOR KIDS. BUT CIRCUSCIRCUS IS JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY :)

LASTLY.... THE SUITE ROOMS ARE SO EFFIN' AWESOME! I CANNOT COMPLAIN! JUST DON'T TOUCH THE MINIBAR IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET CHARGED EXTRA!",0,0,0

Early on I was looking for differences was between Wynn and Encore. The biggest one I found is that Encore is more ""under-stated"" than Wynn. The casino at Encore is modest. Smaller than the one at Wynn. Most of the night clubs are at Wynn. You will find the atmosphere more mellow at Encore and more lively at Wynn. Regardless, it is a short indoor walk between the 2 hotels and you can charge to your room at both hotels, so you really get the best of both worlds.

No complaints about the room or the staff. Everyone is pleasant, smiling, and the place is clean - brand new! The rooms were a great size. The amenities in the room were ample.

Spent one day I was there in the Spa; which is absolutely amazing. Even if you don't get a treatment, it is worth the $30 for a day Spa pass so you can use the gym and use the facilities.

They have a concierge, but I did not need it as I was able to book most of my plans through the reservations agents before I arrived. If you plan on eating out at a particular restaurant, it is worth calling in advance for reservations.

A fabulous stay and I would come again. My ONLY complaints were with my check in and checkout experience. Upon check in, my room key did not work. I had to go back down to the front desk several times before I got upset and someone finally walked up with me to fix my room lock. Upon checkout, I had problems with my bill. I had a difficult and stressful time upon departure because my bill was confusing and deposits were not applied correctly. I had several phone calls after my stay to resolve it. 

So other than the logistics of checking in and checking out, everything in between was fantastic. Check your bill carefully when you leave (also note that the price of everything in Wynn & Encore is inflated. Expect it before you go.)",0,1,1

Five minutes later I got a call from the front desk asking if my tooth brush had been delivered in a timely manner and if they could assist with anything else. I partially wanted to say I forgot something else just to see if maybe they'd step it up a notch and deliver my item with a fireworks or a marching band.

The bedside remote control for lighting and curtains were a novelty and the bathroom is large and has a flat screen tv.

So, you stick a 20 in between your credit card and ID, hand it to them, and say ""I was wondering if you had any complimentary upgrades available?""  We got upgraded from a resort room to the panoramic suite.  The room is about 20% bigger and the view we had was AMAZING!  we had a beautiful view of the Encore pool, Wynn pool, and the Wynn golf course!  The only downside to  a room on this side of Encore is at night, the music from XS is super loud and can be heard from your room. I feel worse for the guests at Wynn since its closer.  

They really need to sound proof their walls better.  The guests next door were super loud, yelling across the hall to their friends room and there was constant knocking on the door.  I kept thinking someone was knocking on our door.  After about the 4th time checking i gave up.  I was going to complain, but figure it would suck to rat on them.  At least the second night they were probably out the whole night and it was nice and quiet except for the loud beats coming from XS.  You can also here people talking down the hallway.  

We ordered room service on Saturday night and ordered a bunch of food including two chicken noodle soups.  As the waiter was setting up the table for us in the room, he knocked over a glass of ice water into the chicken soup.  He quickly said sorry and said he would bring up a new one.  that was no problem.  He put the soup back in the cart and started to roll the cart back out of the room.  As he was doing this, the soup, which he did not cover was spilling out from the wheels of the cart and left two soup trails from the living room area of the room past our bed, past the bathroom and out into the hallway.  I guessed he realized this and i saw him using a towel to wipe the floor which is when i realized something had happened.  We had to wait for someone to come wipe down the sticky marble floor and then for someone to come clean the carpet.  

THEN, my bf decided to shower and realized the cleaning lady took away our shampoo and did not replace it.  It wasn't even half used yet.  sigh.  


Upon checkout i  was waiting by the cafe and witnessed the cafe hostess yelling at a tourist who was standing nearby for really, no reason at all.  She had asked him to move because she needed to bring down a sign to put on the floor.  He moved.  Apparently he did not move far enough because the next thing i noticed, shes yelling at him and saying "" Excuse me!!  I told you very politely to move, so couldn't you just move a little bit farther? sigh *rolls her eyes* with LOTs of attitude""  WOW i was amazed.

I enjoyed this weekend's visit to Encore, however this was largely due to the great clubs, restaurants, and shows that you do not need to be a guest of the hotel to enjoy. 

Pros:
1. Convenience - Encore beach club is one of the best pool clubs in Vegas; Le Reve is playing at Wynn (worth seeing!)
2. Staff is fantastic and very helpful
3. Restaurants are great! Mizumi, Andrea's were both fantastic 

Cons:
1. All of the double queen rooms face the pool\/nightclub. When checking-in we were put on the 5th floor facing the nightclub without any disclosure about noise.  Upon returning to our room the first evening, it sounded like we were literally sleeping in the nightclub (on the pro list, we heard David Guetta's set multiple times, now dubbed ""guetta lullaby""). The staff was helpful and moved our room upon request on our third night when we finally had it with the noise. We were told the only remedy was to move us to a king room on the other side of the hotel  (luckily my friend and I did not mind sharing a bed). It was a pain repacking all of our belongings, lugging them down to the front desk, and then to a new room...I was a bit disappointed. (I would note, I have stayed at Encore hotel before in a double room on a higher floor and had no issue with noise. I would suggest requesting a room as high as possible to avoid the noise inconvenience.
2. The main hotel pool loses sunlight around 2:30pm. This was quite disappointing given one of the main reasons for out trip was to soak up some sun, and we didn't want to pay for encore beach club everyday. 
3. There is no coffee machine in the room, and while you can get complimentary bottled water in the fitness center, none is offered in the room (???) stock up when you go to the gym!",1,0,1

The Encore proved that my perceptions about everything in Vegas being sleezy,dirty and tasteless don't always hold true. This place exudes luxury and class while being just over the top enough that it is unmistakingly 'Vegas'. 
The lobby and Casio areas are a delight for the senses overflowing with natural light, beautiful bright tiles, butterfly wall hangings that are out of a fairytale and the gentle (not overwhelming) 'ping ping ' of slot machines being played. When we got to our rooms we couldn't help but do a little dance accompanied with shrieks of excitement. The folks at the encore thought of everyhting. And I mean everything. The standard rooms are huge and feature a separate living room section with a wrap around sofa and a deluxe bathroom that was almost as big as my studio apartment. The fun 'extras' included, lights and blinds operated by remote control, an iPod dock, fluffy white bathrobes, huge flat screen TV and of course the well stocked and overprices minibar. Honeslty, this was by far the most amazing hotel room I've ever been in. Modern, sexy and plenty big for pre and post partying. 
The customer service at The Encore was top notch from beginning to end. We were checked in quickly and the woman at the desk didn't mind in the least when halfway through the check in process we decided that we should all be on the same floor. We ordered room service several times and I even called the concierge early one morning when I was in desperate need of some hangover assistance befire I showed my face- they were up to me room in 10 minutes flat with Visine!!! The free drinks in the casino were pretty easy to come by even when I was sitting at the penny slots- a sure giveaway that you are only there for said free drinks. 
Top to bottom, start to finish The Encore is an amazing hotel and worth the few extra bucks as compared to other popular places in Vegas. The only reason I wasn't able to give it the elusive 5 stars is because of it's location on the strip and the high prices at all of their bars and restaurants. The tlocation wouldn't bother me so much because that solved by a quick cab ride, but it's tough to escape those high prices when you can't duck out to another hotel easily.",1,0,0

The rooms here are beautiful. Period. And I don't use the word ""beautfiul,"" but I don't think there is a better way to describe it.  These rooms are meant for smaller groups and couples (unlike Palazzo).  It is not as big as Palazzo and just has one King bed, which is nice, but if you're planning on bean packing a butt load of people it ain't gonna work.
What's also cool is that everything is automated including blinds, lights, privacy settings.

The main bad thing here for which I knocked it from a 5 to 4 is b\/c you can hear the XS bass pretty well from your room at night, which is kind of distracting if you're trying to sleep. If you can get past the judgment of me being in my room in Vegas while XS was still open, you'll see my point.  We were on the 14th floor too and it was still not great. It was difficult to fall asleep, so the second night I put it on my ""sleeping"" playlist on my iPad and slept like a baby.

The other downfall, which I didn't really dock for, but is something to take into account is that it is at the very end of the strip, so you do have to walk a bit if you want to go more central areas. However, there is so much around it like the mall across the street and the Wynn Shops and the North Outlets are one (express) bus stop away.

I've stayed at many hotels- I don't stay committed to one place, come on it's vegas, experience everything-even the hotels. Saying that, this is one of my favorite LV places to stay. I've been here twice & both times it's a ball! I feel like royalty! I don't even want to leave the room, because it's so much better than home & outside world, but I have to return to reality & eventually eat.

We came to Vegas to celebrate my girlfriends 22nd birthday (and first ever Vegas trip) a little early I had requested a higher floor and strip view which they remembered with notes and they gave us exactly what we asked for.  I really enjoyed the decor and the fact that there are not as many people here as the Wynn or any other hotel on the strip; so after a long day on the strip you walk into the casino and you get a sense of relaxation.  We stayed on the 52nd floor Panoramic Suite King view toward the strip.

Check in time was at 3pm but my girlfriend and I tried to check in a little too early at about 10 or 11 am and the employee at the check in counter checked us in without a problem so we settled in early, unpacked and relaxed a little from our 5 hour drive from San Diego.  I was very happy that we were able to check in so early.  As soon as we got in out room we noticed a few things wrong, nothing major.  There was a dirty greasy hand print on the ottoman and a few smudges on the mirror by the bed this is no big deal im just nitpicking.  Overall the room upon check in was very clean and smelled great.

I first checked the in-room controls by the bed and noticed the one side of the drapes would not close, so I told a housekeeping lady I saw in the hallway and she quickly told somebody and we got it fixed right away.  I was very happy on the quick response.  everything else was smooth sailing in regards to the room.  A\/C was cold just like it should be, the view was awesome.

On the casino floor (where I lost a lot of cash, but hey that's Vegas) where I played slots  there were not very many people which was a plus for me.  I wasn't elbow to elbow with people like I was at various casinos down the strip.  It smelled like cigarettes but was very minimal compared to any other casino I visited.  There were not very many waitresses walking around offering drinks and I was on my machine maybe for 30 minutes before I even saw one. Finally when I saw one she walked right past me, then about two more walked by, no offer.  Then I spoke up and the waitress stopped and looked as if I was bothering her with my polite request for a rum and coke which was a turn off.

I did not visit the pools on this trip so I cannot review them but I did attend Surrender, the Encore's premier nightclub and when I say Premier I mean expensive!  I thought the Encore was expensive in general but boy was I mistaken.  I saw Skrillex (a dubstep DJ) and it was $50 for men and $40 for women which was not bad.  I was informed by the concierge that we bought our tickets from since we were guests of the hotel that our tickets would act as front of the line passes and that there was a dress to impress dress code of a collared shirt, nice jeans or dress pants, with dress shoes.  We went to our room and changed into our ""dress to impress"" apparel and went down to the line and asked the security guard where our hotel guest line was and he pointed to the general admission line.  I guess that's what you get when you're a hotel guest.  When we got in around 11pm I noticed that people were wearing t-shirts and regular street clothes.  If I knew that was acceptable club clothing I wouldn't have even dressed up. after waiting hours for Skrillex to come on, he finally did at 1am he did a decent 2 hour set.  We didnt get back up to our room till 4am.

My biggest gripe with the club was the outrageous price of the drink(s).  I went to the bar and ordered one redbull and vodka and the bartender made it and handed it to me over the bar and said ""that'll be $21""  I thought he was joking! I was wrong! $21 for a drink smaller than a solo cup and tasted weaker than an O'Douls,  Never again will I buy a drink from Surrender.  Pre-Game before you go to the club. Didnt tip, felt bad for like 2 minutes until I realized how much money they were making off me.

Next morning did some gambling and went to the Eastside Bar and ordered a Crown and Coke for $8 (more reasonable than Surrender).  The bartender was awesome and I believe he was only on his 4th day working at the Encore.  He goes over to me and says ""Sir, can you please turn your hat around to the front, we have a dress code to follow""  A backwards hat is part of my Southern California roots and it was hard to do but I complied because they are just trying to do their jobs and they get their rules from the top.  Nothing personal just a little weird that they have a dress code at the bar.

Overall, I had an awesome time.  I think the Encore ruined any other hotel for me.  I dont think I could (or would) stay anywhere else unless I was on a strict budget.  I cant wait to stay here again.  The Panoramic suite is a must if you want a higher floor and better view.",2,0,0

For parking, I've been told it's self-park and is easily accesible to the hotel. 

I came here with five other girls for a weekend (Saturday - Monday). The hotel is super nice and fancy. We got a suite with two beds and a view of the strip. The suite is gigantic even for a total of six girls. We added on an extra resort fee so we can use the Wifi and we all connected with ease. We couldn't use the fridge but it wasn't too bad since we had an ice bucket to fill up with the ice machine down the hall. Choosing a hotel in Vegas is all about location. What's so great about this one is the fact that Surrender and XS was right downstairs. These are both the top choices of clubs for my group of friends and it was nice to be able to take my time to get ready and not have to worry about trekking outside in a taxi. The only downside is that is it a bit far from the strip so bring walking shoes or be prepared to pay for a taxi. In the end, I'd rather pay for transportion for our day activities rather than walking in the cold trying to get to a club at night. The staff was really attentive and most people greeted us while were walking out and about in the hotel. I'd can't imagine staying anywhere else in Vegas!",2,1,0

The room was wonderfully appointed with very minimal signs of any wear.  What you see in the pictures is pretty much exactly what you get.

Check in was a breeze.  The line moved very quickly!  All hands were on deck at the front desk. While we waited cold water was being offered to everyone in line, very nice touch.  The front desk itself isn't all that grand to be honest.  I wasn't impressed but I wasn't disappointed either.  Not as nice as the front desk at the wynn.  

The casino here is actually pretty small.  We found ourselves walking to the casino at the Wynn often but not a deal breaker since it's all connected and only a short walk.  Cocktail service was exceptional !  Always had a drink on my hand.  Wonderful !

During our stay we also saw le reve which was awesome !   Highly recommend watching the show if you've never seen it !  Best of all it's just a short walk !  Since it's connected to the hotel we were able to dress up for the show and not worry about the terrible heat outside.

Our room had a connecting door but we never heard the neighbors at all.  Only thing we ever heard actually was just the door but that's only  because all the doors here are large and heavy. Our room was facing the pool\/ strip and the front desk did warn us it would be loud at night.  I had no problem sleeping at night but my bf did so if your a light sleeper definitely bring ear plugs. Not sure if it was just this time but the air being pumped into the casino\/hotel wasn't scented which is no big deal really but I always love it when a hotel smells nice.  The pool was alright ..  a bit small.  Definitely more of a place to socialize than to swim.  They play music but it's very low.  I guess maybe the keeps the crowds down?   The pool was busy but plenty of space to not feel crammed

Housekeeping!  You are fantastic!   Late in the day we called to have our room made up and usually at other hotels it will take hours and hours before anyone shows up (if at all) but to our delight the room was made up super fast !  We called housekeeping as we were walking out to gamble and maybe two hours later we came back up to get ready for a show and everything had been put back into place !  Chocolates and slippers were left beside with a cute little note AND she found my ring !  Could not have been happier.  

As great as our experience was there was only one thing that fell short.  On our last night we stayed up too late so we called front desk and inquired if we could pay for the late check out or add an additional night if that wasn't available.  Front desk was polite but states that they were fully booked and couldnt accommodate my request.  Ok no problem.  My fault anyway for staying up too late n all.  Later that evening while having lunch I decided to check online just for kicks to see if they were fully booked since I thought it was odd being that it was a Sunday and sure enough they have rooms available.   Worst yet was because it was a Sunday the rate was very affordable.  So that was a let down.  Really wanted to stay another day to just chill and gamble.",0,0,0

When the 3 of us arrived, the front desk agent confirmed that we indeed are getting a room with two beds and everything is honky dory.  We checked in late and had dinner reservations within an hour an a half so time was of the essence.  When we opened the door to the room, we were in awe of the lovely decor and the special touches.  We loved the view and the huge restroom.  But what we didn't love is the fact that there was only one King bed in the room.....I called downstairs right away and was told that the front desk agent must have made a mistake and there were no rooms with two beds available.  I asked to speak to the manager and he offered a roll away bed which I refused because we didn't pay $300 for a room for one of us to sleep on a rollaway. Eventually I was able to persuade the manager to get us moved over to the Wynn to get the two beds but the hotel room was not comparable and we spent 2 hours on the ordeal including having to lug our luggage across the two hotels and then proceed back to the Encore to get our car out of valet.  We missed our dinner reservations as well. Encore is a beautiful place but the practice of overbooking is not cool.

Encore is really a sight to behold. Coming into the lobby and seeing the surrounding restaurants, shops, and pools--amazing. The casino is different in that it's not loud with the constant ""dinging"" coming from the slot machines. 

My room was just one of the basic rooms but it was roomy and comfortable. I didn't want to leave at the end of my stay. The only downside was that the room wasn't totally clean when I arrived. There was still trash in the trash can and there was some Mardi Gras beads hanging on one of the lamps. The view was amazing from my room though.

The pools were really nice. They had a small and a big pool. The big pool was European but not a lot of people went ""Euro"" there. The only bad thing about the pool was the service. They have a bar next to the pool and waitresses going around but it seemed like if you were not renting a cabana or one of the beds in the pool--they didn't care about you and that sucked! I was in a party of 10 people in the pool and we didn't order any drinks until after we chased down 2 staff people. LAME!

I loved that it still is so new, and the casino was a bit brighter too which was nice.  There was a ""taste of Wynn"" event going on where all the restaurants were doing 3 course prix fixe starting at $29.  We were also able to talk a pit boss down on the minimum bet on an empty table so we could afford gambling.  I guess the down economy is hurting them too.

The European pool was nice and quiet on a Sunday morning, walking thru the spa made me realized that I'll definitely have to try it next time (and maybe take some photos there).

Recently I accompanied my boyfriend on a trip over the weekend and we opted for the Encore over The Wynn to try it out. The rate for a weekend at this amazing place was very good. They do have a rate guarantee if you book on the Wynn site, FYI. That includes an upgrade, and a price match. On check in, we had a bit of a line at the check in desk. But the staff was more than apologetic and kind to us on check in. We had booked a suite and it was upgraded to a panoramic view suite. I had just had surgery on my spine earlier that week and the check in girl offered to send up a refrigerator for my ice packs needed for my recovery. I know, spine surgery recovery in Vegas ??? Well, a suite at The Wynn Encore makes it a perfect place. It's truly a 5 star experience. The rooms in Vegas on a weekend can be noise intrusive from the halls. This room is sound proof; the only exception is our room was 39 floors up and we could hear the Deadmau5 party below both weekend nights bumping until about 0500am; I only know because I was up to medicate myself! The room was a spacious suite; two separate rooms and a bathroom suite with soaking tub and separate water closet. Little touches like touch control shades , drapes, night lights that dimly light the hall and bath area for night and EVEN the 'do not disturb' or 'make up room' are done via touch control. We ordered room service on our Saturday here; my love wanted a Wynn Signature Bloody Mary; no alcohol allowed for me, so I wanted a nonfat cappuccino service. The room service attendant, Diane, arrived about 30 minutes later , ( it's a huge hotel and I imagine room service in Vegas on a weekend is slammed), and had my steamed, frothed milk and espresso in separate canisters to keep hot. His Bloody Mary was hand shaken and mixed by Diane. She was friendly and on top of her game. Steve Wynn must appreciate his guests to make sure his staff is that attentive to the needs of the guest . We tried to add an extra tip to her check and she said , 'No! It's all inclusive in your bill'; that's never heard of. We dined at a few of the restaurants on Wynn\/Encore property. One thing to remember: this is a 5star property to 'compete' with 'the best of the strip' , The Venetian; The Bellagio. You are gonna shell out some dollars by being here. The 2$ restaurant will run you close to $100 and the drinks in the lobby bar average $14 plus. It's not for coming to Las Vegas on a budget. If that's your thing , stay at a lower rated property. Everything here is beautiful; floral everywhere; high end shopping , like Fendi and Dior!!! I die! Great people watching from most places that are public : our place for my boo to have a night cap was the Lobby Bar. The typical club pretty's all shiny and drunk are fun to watch going to and from the clubs on property! Yes. Even The Wynn has drunk girls and guys and that's always fun entertainment; it's even better because I could not drink this time! The pool was wall to wall and closes early, in my opinion, to set up for the clubbing crowd. One pool staying open for adults would not be a bad idea. The staff manning the pool were also on their game, attentive and nice. Another note, not many children. Sorry. We like that. Our travel mates were down the strip further at a popular hotel, and the children running around the pool and common areas was beyond annoying; kids in Vegas???? Return factor , MINUS a surgery recovery, all in:-) I love this place .. More than The Venetian and more than The Bellagio. Next time I will stay a bit longer ; enjoy the spa and more of the food when I feel 100%.",3,1,2

Two bathrooms and a smaller room with a massage table were also part of this absurd floor plan.  The room came equipped with a nice TV and a coffee table laden with all manner of fresh fruits and chocolaty sweets.  Everything was clean, spacious, and well-lit, with a tasteful off-white and cafe-au-lait color scheme.  The beds and seats were cloud comfortable.  I do believe this was the most opulent room I've ever had the pleasure of staying in.

During the day, we lazed about in an Encore cabana by the huge pool, and it was sinfully relaxing.  We ordered food from the room service menu, and everything was delicious.  I would strongly recommend the breakfast pizza.

The casino is great as well.  $25 blackjack was my choice this trip, and I played at various tables with friendly dealers at every one.  Too bad the Encore doesn't have its own poker room, but the Wynn is just an amble away.

I've been staying all over the Las Vegas strip area since the late 80's and I can't say that any service on the strip has been as memorable as this last stay. I've stay with Mirage, Mandalay, Tropicana, Venetian and with a past in working in the hospitality and customer service industry, my expectations were met and beyond satisfied. 

I was lucky enough to receive a thrill promotion in the mail and it just seemed too good to pass up. Thankfully my birthday was coming up so it gave me a reason to come and take advantage of this promotion. When I arrived, the bell man was so wonderful and even thanked me for choosing to stay with the Encore. The checking in process was simple, fast, easy and the lady who checked us in was so welcoming and delightful. She was informative and didn't seem nervous which made the process easy going. The service from bell man, concierge, checking in or out, room service and housekeeping were so spot on. Everything that I requested, was met and when I needed something or had something delivered to the room, an estimated time was always met. I can go on endlessly at how the service was just so wonderful and I can really say that we left wanting to come back again. We've already found ourselves a reason to come back. 

One issue that I while being at the hotel was that when taking advantage of the Red Club Card, the lady there didn't seem welcoming. She seemed irritated and actually, snobby. To be honest, I felt like she looked down upon me because I look young. When I had signed up, she informed me of the free play and after the first 300 points, I could come back to spin the wheel. When I came back later that late night, I won a buffet. She asked if I wanted to redeem it and of course at 1 or 2 in the morning, that wasn't something that I was interested in doing so she put it on my account. Being that I was using my Red Card for everything, the next morning, I went to the buffet and charged it to the room. Upon check out, this charge for the buffet that I had won was not waived. Now, I don't mind the situation too much but just for further guests maybe the Red Club Card team should inform their guests that they will have to come and receive a voucher for a buffet redemption. Personally, it shouldn't have made a difference if I went to the buffet with the voucher or not and the fact that it wasn't waived really upset me.

I find this casino to be more navigable than Wynn -- for some reason I always get disoriented in Wynn when I am in the casino...maybe that was done by design so I never leave...hmmm.

Some interesting points: I don't like the casino decor as much as Wynn's (everything red with butterflies isn't necessarily my thing) but it definitely differentiates itself from its predecessor, despite looking like it's mini-me from the outside. The light fixtures definitely make a statement -- they look like they were salvaged from a really expensive pirate ship whose captain had an unhealthy fixation with coral. But this is me trying to find things to nitpick because at the end of the day, Encore is great. XS (when the pool area is open on the weekends) is one of my favorite clubs and has yet to disappoint.

The Wynn & Encore are both ravishing. The designers of these two hotels did a phenomenal job all throughout the hotel and casino. One thing I love about the hotels in Vegas is that they like to connect casinos if they're right next to each other. That's awesome because most of the time, you don't even need to step outside. It's great for those blistering hot days or frigid cold nights.

Another great perk about staying here is XS is within the same hotel. No taxi ride to get there and no need to stand in that horrendous line after the club to get back. Awesome, because my feet are usually killing me after a night of clubbing.

Though it is a trying task to get the two great entities (Vegas.com & The Wynn) to communicate, both parties turned out to be very accommodating (with my fair share of phone calls.) I had reserved two rooms\/requested that they be adjoining, but was told that no promises could be made... that it would depend on vacancy and check-in time (ie: the earlier you check in, the more likely you are to get adjoining rooms.) Still, they made a note of my request and pulled through in the end.

The perks of the hotel are endless, and the pictures (http:\/\/www.wynnlasvegas.com\/Rooms\/EncoreResorts\/ResortSuite) do not lie. Housekeeping is wonderful, and the front desk will set you up with anything you need in terms of travel\/show bookings. 

Things you should bring:

-Sunblock (Or you might end up like me, shelling out $30 for the hotel brand, so that you can lounge around the uh-mazing Encore pool without frying to a crisp.) 

-A portable coffee machine (Be warned! The Encore does not provide in-room coffee machines. In-house coffee starts at $5\/cup and travels up from there.)

Things you should know:

The Encore charges you a resort fee ($25\/night) and then taxes the resort fee. So be prepared to spend an extra $28\/night.

Overall impression:

Initial impression was good.  Lovely room with a great view of the strip.  Then we turned the lights on.  The room had not been vacuumed; there were pieces of something (maybe cork) on the carpet in both ""rooms"" of the suite.  There were what appeared to be sex stains on the couch.  A Halls lozenge wrapper was on the nightstand.

Housekeeping came to the room and I demanded that the sheets be changed (yes including the mattress cover which they were going to leave) and fresh towels be brought in.

We ordered an unsatisfactory meal in our room (Macaroni and cheese with lobster was actually rubbery lobster in a cream sauce with toasted bread crumbs sprinkled on top) that was sent back after two bites.

The next morning, we had coffee and a stale muffin from the coffee service station in the lobby which is a bar most of the time.

Stayed from 7\/22\/2013, planned to leave on 7\/25, but on the morning of the 25th decided to blow off our flight and stay another night.  Cost $500 for the change in room and air charges, but well worth it, won $2000 on Baccarat.

Beautiful rooms, quite, stayed on the 14th floor looking north.  No noise from anywhere inside or outside the hotel.  Room service was terrific the sea bass was better from room service than SW Steakhouse.  Bed and bathroom were fantastic.

The SW steakhouse was a real disappointment.  My wife order the sea bass and it was just terrible, the restaurant did not charge for the SB.  Steak was very good, but could have been found at any upscale Vegas steakhouse.  The light show was also very disappointing, we saw the show years ago, with the jungle scenes and great music, now it's just a 1 minute snippet of the 10 minute show from the past.

The rooms are opulently appointed and there is a panel at your bedside to operate the curtains, lights and even the privacy option on your door.  Very cool.  The room is a compact suite and very well designed - but it is not large for a suite.  The bathtub is a standard size soaking tub for one person.  Again, nice but small. My main issue with the room is that despite the opulence, the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbor's t.v.  Also, even though I was 21 floors up, I still heard the traffic on the strip late at night.  

The staff at Encore is the best on the strip.  This would also push me to five stars.  

However, my issues with Encore are these:  I sat down at a lobby bar and began playing video poker and was asked for my drink order.  Anywhere else I have been in Vegas - including Caesars (at least on my last visit), you are comped while playing  video poker at a bar.  Not at the Encore.  My absolute on the rocks - although plentiful and strong - was $15.00 w\/ tip.   Later in my trip, I went to Society Cafe for breakfast and the menu items were $18.00 and above.  We're talking breakfast folks.  

Onto the spa and fitness center.  There is about a $15.00 fee to use the fitness center.  I believe this price is reasonable and in-line with other Vegas properties if you're not paying a resort fee.  However, beware that if you want to use the locker room or showers - that bumps up your visit to $55.00.  This facility is very nice - but $55 to take a steam and shower is ridiculous. 

So, obviously, who goes to the Wynn\/Encore and complains about the prices?  A valid point.   However, regardless of the price you pay for your lodging in Las Vegas - we as customers should expect a decent value.  High end properties should deliver high end value and so forth.  My issue, is that I thought Wynn\/Encore would be above the nickel and diming that takes place all over Vegas.  It is not.

Parking was ample.  There was no line at check in nor any sort of area roped off for a line.  Check in was ridiculously quick by any hotel standards, but especially by Vegas standards.  

The suite was not small by any means, but also not the largest that I've stayed in.  The floor to ceiling windows are really what won my heart.  There's something amazing about that kind of a view from a Vegas high rise.

Some of our party had never been to Vegas or gambled before, so we paused near the edge of the casino floor to point out different tables and make suggestions about what to try. We had paused less than 30 seconds when an employee approached our group and began shouting, ""Who are you waiting for? Who are you waiting for?""

Before we could answer or try to understand what he was shouting about, he began waving a flashlight around, saying ""You can't be here, move along"" repeatedly.  He then followed us, shooing us with his flashlight.

I've played and hanged out several times at Encore, so eventually I wanted to stayed here. Finally got a room with the GF and one of my boys. They're both Vegas virgins and Encore didn't disappoint their first time experience. 

I won't be redundant and describe every little details about the room. It's going to have the amenities and features you would expect. Plus, the infamous swivel TV. But suffice to say, it's nice, immaculate, and spacious. Nice, soft, comfy bed. Floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of the pools at Encore\/Wynn and a bit of the strip. It was really cool to take the nice white leather desk chair put it in front of the windows, put your feet up, and take in the view. 

I had heard about the music at XS raging all night long. Although we wouldn't mind that so much due to that's the way we are and partly because we would stay up til sunrise anyway. I did request a higher floor room. We whine up being on the 37th floor and couldn't hear anything from XS or Surrender. 

Went to the Encore pool on Thursday and Friday. Nice garden ambiance. Resort pool with kids was not loud or obnoxious at all. European pool was nice as well, just a few girls that were topless. It wasn't that much of a party pool and I'm saying that in a good way. Nice and serene. Nice touch to have elevators leading directly to the pool and avoiding the casino floor. We went to the Wynn pool on Saturday. I would say the major difference is the Wynn pool is bigger and music is blasting from the European party pool. So to each their own. I did wish that both pools had more cabana girls serving drinks b\/c the wait can be awhile before they get to you. 


Went up to concierge desk to get line passes to XS. Had a slight snafu there, wanted the tickets for Saturday night and told him that, he printed them for Friday. So we double check and one of the other concierge guy passed us and asked if everything was alright and then we asked about the passes. Turns out , the passes does have to be printed for the night you're going. Then he told us come back tomorrow and they'll take care of it. After waiting for a good while at the desk on Saturday, turns out, you can have the passes printed for whatever night anytime. So after discovering the mistake on Friday they could have printed passes for Saturday night right then and there. So be sure that the passes are printed for the night you're going, to avoid this situation. But still a minor thing in my book. 

Wherever we were at; valet, craps table, pool, or bar. The guest service was superb to us. The interaction was always polite, courteous, and warm. 

Another thing, I notice on the other reviews some Yelpers think the Encore is a little ""off"" or not as lively as Wynn or far from the strip. Granted the deli\/cafe\/buffet is at the Wynn and you have to walk over there. But I consider all of it one big resort, so don't be lazy about a leisurely stroll people!!! 

Another point, if you're a first timer and want to be near the strip or have a really good strip view. This place is not ideal. Even though you'll get a view of the pools and golf course. Your view will be partially block by the Wynn itself. The location is a little away from the action of the strip. Who needs it, if you're a Vegas regular and you don't need that toursity\/kitsch of the strip. It goes back to the Encore being a more serene option to stay at.

Now, for the nightly atmosphere. I agree there is a subtle difference between Encore and Wynn. The Wynn is bigger, thus more people therefore more rowdy action. I would say Encore is crowded and the Wynn is packed. The difference can be visualize as the craps table at Wynn has a lot of 21yr olds and the tables at Encore has the 30yr olds that actually has money...I kid, I kid. But come Friday or Saturday night there are plenty of girls in heels prancing around at both places. At 5am Friday night\/Saturday morning at the craps table, it was full and we had a rowdy good time with Josh & Sully from Buffalo. So I couldn't tell the difference. 

The beautiful surroundings and great guest service lead me to book a room here. I'm happy to tell you there was no let-down. Encore strives to be a boutique that caters to the more refine instead of the masses. It's suppose to be a different alternative to Wynn. A serene place to step away from it all when you want to. But when you're ready, it brings the heat too. Stay here.",11,1,2

I figured being a high quality establishment they would at the very least have someone personally call me to discuss the experience, nope. Just a semi generic email. This just frustrated me further and gave credence to the concerns I raised in the survey. I work for a large company well regarded for their exceptional customer service-even in our retail establishments when a customer responds poorly to our surveys they are personally contacted to discuss the matter.

Comfortable beds
Automatic controls for almost everything
Very modern and fancy decor

Cons:
Rooms were smaller than the Palazzo and the Venetian.
Sign in front of the elevators stating that we couldn't bring food in
Small hotel, basically XS, a few restaurants and that's it.
Service people were annoying and not helpful
A little far down the strip

I stayed there for my friend's bachelorette party and the service could not have been any ruder. They charged us $500 bucks for a cabana that we tried to use, but they wouldn't let us.

They barely have anything on the floor portion and the casino is absolutely tiny in comparison to the Wynn which is already small in comparison to many other hotels \/ casinos. 

The restaurants in here look like they have potential but again ... too new to judge because I went to one of the cafes and the bartenders were still dropping the glasses everywhere. I am not opposed to the Encore but I feel like it has the same effect as Palazzo on the Venetian except smaller. It's basically the same thing and with the price difference I don't think its worth picking one over the other if that's all you're going after especially since the Wynn is far more established and has much more grandeur.",3,0,2

After our effortless check-in in the main lobby, we were ushered over to our private entrance in the tower suites. The Encore Tower Suite's private lobby is absolutely gorgeous! It is exquisitely chic in design with posh furniture. I just wished the rooms had the same sense of style and drama. 

Our King Suite room overlooking the Wynn Tower and The Strip was perched high up on the 50th floor of the Encore Tower Suites. It's actually a quick ride up the elevator where you'll pass through an extremely swanky elevator waiting room and stylish hallway. The room opens up into a dramatic hallway that is lined with cold marble floors and floor-to-ceiling length mirrors. The room is long, spacious with an ethereal color scheme: a lot of beige, cream white, brown and neutral colors. I was very fond of the elegant marble floors, bathroom and accents. However, the color scheme, artwork, drapery and wallpaper, could of used some more personality; we felt it was overall too ""Vanilla"" for our personal preference.

The King Bedroom has a television screen that rotates 360 degrees so that you can adjust it to be viewed from the bed or on the other side of the living room. The mattress, pillows, and linens are top quality and extremely comfortable. I told my fiance that we need to make sure to purchase the entire bed-set for our home since I slept super sound and enjoyed every moment in bed. 

The living room adjacent to the bedroom is outfitted with a very comfortable large suede brown L shaped couch that also rested along a mirrored wall. The window facing the strip was, of course, larger than life, floor-to-ceiling window filled the entire wall with a breathtaking view out to the city lights. 

The lighting and drapery in the room were all controlled electronically by a push of a button on a nifty device found at the door's entrance and then again right at the bedside. It is truly a convenient feature that we appreciated the most during our stay.

The spacious bathroom was equipped with all of the necessities to make sure you're comfortable and covered during your stay: television, walk in shower with perfect water pressure and temperature, comfortable oversize tub, private toilet room, Jack and Jill sinks, a light-up cosmetic vanity, hair dryer, and of course a wide selection of Molton Brown toiletries. Room service had no problem with refilling us up extra for each day we stayed. We love Molton Brown products, so it was such a treat to have it available to use during our stay. 

The service was top-notch from start to finish. The care and attention that we are given the entire time from all of the staff we interacted with surpassed my expectations.

Here are some perks that were exemplary:
- Complimentary valet - Of course you will want to tip, but they were extremely fast and friendly
- Private entrance - Such an exquisite feature; no crowds, no wait, just a private, chic entrance, lounge area and access to the Tower Suite elevators 
- Complimentary Breakfast for every morning - A great variety to choose from, beautiful presentation and deliciously gourmet served in room with a view!
- Room service - anything we needed promptly at our finger tips 

Some minor complaints:
- The TV service was down for a few hours while we were lounging in our suite
- The internet\/cell service is shoddy and nonexistent the majority of our stay from the 50th floor of the tower suites, even though we signed into the complimentary WiFi 
- It's far away from most dining and entertainment on the Strip
- Most dining and entertainment closes early except for Clubs on certain evenings or the Allegro at the Wynn
- Room is lacking a lot of personality and character

This was an experience to remember. However, my fiance and I both agree that our room had less appeal than the suites at the Cosmopolitan. I really wanted to be able to view the twinkling lights on the strip from the comfort of bed, but again, the design of the room is less functional than the Cosmopolitan terrace suites.

PRO TIP: I would recommend staying here if you love luxury and would like to be tucked away privately from all of the action. However, if action and life is what you crave, you will be well suited at the Cosmopolitan, which is still our favorite place to stay!",18,13,18

When I booked the hotel, I had the choice of Encore at Wynn or Four Seasons, unfortunately I chose Encore. My last time making that mistake. 

Originally we had chosen to stay one night at Encore but as soon as we saw our room we decided for a second night. Mistake #2! The first night, the people next door were partying all night and with the bass from the Encore club we never were able to sleep. We complained and nothing was done. 

When we finally were able to start sleeping, one of the drunken idiots from next door decided to bang on our door. He could not distinguish between our door and the other door. After 3 minutes I was able to convince him he was at the wrong room. 

The next morning we asked to change our room due to the music and people next door. At 10am we moved all our belongings to our new room, located in a quieter part of the hotel. We left for breakfast and on our return discovered none of our keys would work for our new room. 

Went to the front desk and explained the keys didn't work. They apologized for the mix up end informed us we were never checked out of the other room or checked into our existing room. Also, we will need to be checked into a new room. He proceeded to give us new keys to a new room. When I explained all our belongs were in the room, he said we will need to move them again. I was fired up. I asked for the manager. I explained the situation to the manager. He was apologetic and explained they had miscommunication on their side. He then gave us new room keys to our existing room. 

We went back to our room with the new keys, which worked. A couple of hours later we went shopping, at the mall located across the street. When we returned to our room, 3 hours later, once again our room keys did not work. This was a reoccurring theme. After dinner, our room keys did not work. When we went out for drinks, our room keys did not work again. Four separate times we were forced to go to the lobby and have our keys programed, which worked once but never again. 

The ironic part is, all the keys failed to work a second time. We were given 3 keys every time and all 3 would not work after a length of time. After reprogram, the keys would get us back in our room but failed to work again. It appeared as if someone or something kept resetting the lock code. 

I can understand one key being rubbed against a magnet (which I don't carry)or electronic device (very rare) but not all three failing, especially if they worked the first time.

We received a promo in the mail for Wynn\/Encore and booked 3 nights at the Encore since we've both visited the Wynn before(and were mighty impressed).

Crazily enough, we took THE BUS from the airport and it dropped us off at the back of the property(at the convention center) where there was a shuttle to whisk convention-goers to the front doors of both properties.  The instant I walked into Encore, I fell in love with the smell.  If you're crazy sensitive about scents, this might not be the best place for you but I liked it so much, I bought a bottle of it in the gift shop.

I prefer the Encore to the Wynn because it's quieter and a bit away from the craziness.  We were there mid-week but checked out on a Friday afternoon and there were loads of people so maybe it gets nuts on the weekends.  I'll stick to weekdays, thank you! : )

Our room had all kinds of hi tech gadgetry and a great view of the south strip.  Very comfy bed, great bathrooms.  the pool and gardens were lovely.  Not a negative peep in me about the whole experience.

Over all, what can I say? It was a truly amazing place. Our King Suite was fantastic, everything provided was outstanding, and the service from staff was first class.

I am neither wealthy nor broke, but if I ever find myself with a sustained abundance of cash, I hope I NEVER start acting like ""rich people.""

I would definitely stay at The Encore again, but probably not with my kids. Again, as beautiful and elegant as the place is, it just seems a but overly hoity-toity for a family visit. Plus, with the ""no strollers"" sign visible at every entrance, I wouldn't want any snobs giving me a reason to backhand them for sneering at my kids.

I don't hold this against The Encore. Again, the staff there was amazing, friendly, and accommodating. The amenities were amazing. The buffet, quite honestly, puts any buffet I have ever been to to shame. Finally, The Encore is the home of the show called La Reve (I'll review that separately).

1.  Valet:  first time using it and they were fast and efficient
2.  Check-in:  This time was awful.  Friday afternoon they should be prepared for crowds and figure out how to streamline.  My ""favorite"" part is when my husband and teens were standing away from the line (so as not to clog it up) and security? told them that couldn't stand there.  Husband told him that if they could streamline check-in, he wouldn't have to stand there.  Fortunately, security apologized and brought them water.
3.  Upgraded my room for only $20 additionally and was put on the top floor with great views.
4.  I grabbed a half bottle of wine from mini-bar and only drank a glass of the chardonnay.  Placed it back in bar to keep it chilled; maid took it out and when I returned it was warm.  Boo.  Wasn't try to sneak out wine, just keeping it cold.
5.  Pool was busier this time and it took us longer than usual to flag down server for drinks.
6.  Ordered room service of ice cream & desserts for the family and although they were fast & efficient, the ""hot"" fudge was cold and could NOT be poured over the ice cream.  Yuck.  
7.  It annoys me when the maid does not replenish shampoo, etc in the bathroom.

Despite all the above, I did decide to keep it at 4 stars because I think the Encore exceeds other Vegas hotels I've stayed at (Mirage, MGM, Treasure Island, Paris, etc.)",1,0,0

Don't get me wrong, the rooms are really nice, they have high quality stuff in the rooms, and the casino is great, but the hotel  side service is sorely lacking. 

We arrived on Friday around 4 pm and the check in scene is utter chaos. No lines, no organization, nothing. No one knows who is supposed to be where and no one is providing guidance. We finally reach the front and the first first words out of the woman's mouth are ""I need ids from all people staying in the rooms and the credit card you booked the room with."" Ok. No welcome to Encore, have you been here before, etc. That is the first greeting we get. I hand the stuff over--although I've never stayed anywhere that asked for ID from all people in the room (we later realized it was so they could create a frequent game account for everyone) but whatever. Check in takes forever while she scours the list for rooms and she seems irritated when we ask that our room be away from the nightclubs to avoid late night noise. I note that, throughout our stay the check in process always appeared chaotic and disorganized so it doesn't seem to have been a one off problem. 

Once in the room, the room is, as I said, very nice, although calling the king suites a suite is questionable - its basically a hotel room with a divider. Its a nice room to be sure though. The bathroom is especially nice. But, the poor service continued as on not one day did housekeeping replace the shampoo, soap etc from the first night. I had to call each time and while they sent one up I got neither an apology nor was anyone surprised this happened. My guess is its the policy at this place to give you one set of stuff and make you call if you want more. Talk about cheap. Not what I expect from what's supposed to be a 5 star experience. Also, we need to talk about the mini bar. I like beer--especially premium beer. Someone needs to tell the Encore folks that Corona is NOT premium beer. Extreme FAIL there. 

Fast forward to the end of our stay and I go to check out on the tv and lo and behold there is a stray charge from a bar we did not go to. So I call the front desk and am required to come down and fill out a ""dispute form."" This is really unprecedented. I've had incorrect charges before, including in Vegas and have never had to come fill out a form. All for $14. Most properties take it off automatically and apologize. But the Encore requires you to fill out a form for this simple task--which the front desk person was easily able to deal with by printing out the receipts to attach to the form, receipts that clearly were not signed by me.  Also, neither the woman I spoke to on the phone nor the front desk person ever apologized for the error and inconvenience. 

I like 5 star properties, and I realize the there is a difference between ""Vegas 5 star"" and true 5 star resorts, because there is always corner cutting and a certain amount of annoyance you deal with at any Vegas property. I don't expect Ritz Carlton\/Four Seasons level service at a Vegas casino property. But I don't expect this either. I've stayed at a number of Vegas properties and have never experienced poor service like this, even when forced to stay at some of the brutal downtown places for business conferences. Its too bad, because we really liked the casino and the room, but with hotel service like this, I just can't see staying here again with so many other options on the strip.",2,1,1

Encore is very Asian looking , very classy with that in mind but I'm not necessarily a fan of swing dragons on walls and Asian slot machines with Asian symbols.
I do give this place a 5 star, I have been here a number of times and each time the accommodations were great, rooms are very clean, in room dining service is professional and food (in room and restaurants) are great.

Many people downgrade the ratings because of the price, but it is your choice to stay here and dine here and I leave it at that.

I like the idea that all players have the same looking players card, and I respect the business model overall.

There are some weaker spots in the resort: buffet is not stellar(try Bachanall for that reason), and the variety of shops\/stores are not stellar either. Showcasing top brands might miss the core principle.

The casino and layout are confusing, the rooms are a little much in terms of decor, etc. But with Encore, Wynn and his team really hit their stride. Just about everything at this place works, and it's probably become my favorite Vegas hotel, just above THEhotel at Mandalay Bay.

Public areas: Red, red, red. It works in the casino and check-in area in a way it didn't in the rooms at Wynn. It's vivid and exciting; the design is a stunner... well, except for those ugly red chandeliers that look like huge upside-down spiders. Otherwise, bravo. The casino layout is the easiest to navigate in any Vegas mega-property. You can actually see all the way from one end to the other of what is basically a big rectangle, and the two long sides have natural light and outside views. There are restaurants and lounges arranged around the perimeter--no following signs around corners and meandering casino paths to find anything. 

Spa\/Pool: The fitness center is pretty much what you would expect--big, with plenty of machines of all types. The spa waiting area is a stunner. It looks like the living room of an Arabian prince with great taste. The interior is great as well--the plunge pool area has a huge tile wall with a copper cherry tree mosaic. Just gorgeous. There are also heated tiled lounge chairs which vibrate slightly. It would be easy to lose an afternoon dozing on one of those. There's a $30 daily use fee, which is outlandish but about the norm for Vegas. The pool is not a match for Mandalay Bay's [still the best in town], but it's nice in its own right with plenty of lounge chairs; even on a busy weekend, we were able to find a couple of chairs together with no problem. Drink service was frequent and efficient. The European [topless] pool is pretty much the same as the main pool, only with a huge center bar. Guys, sorry to say there was only one pair of assets on display the day I was there. Don't know how well this European bathing trend is catching on.

Rooms: Much calmer and more relaxing than the public areas. Mostly in the beige family, but there were plenty of accent touches to give it character. There's rough-textured houndstooth wallpaper behind the mini-bar armoire and rust colored wallpaper behind the beds and on the entry-way ceiling. The L-shaped sofa is a great touch and the sitting area is huge. Of course, everything is remote-controlled from the bedside. I might question the choice of painting over the sofa, which is basically three big white circles on a black background, but whatever. If you've stayed at THEhotel, Venetian\/Palazzo, or Bellagio, then you know what to expect in the bathrooms. Very plush and spacious, but not necessarily distinctive. We had a double-bed room with a spectacular view over the Wynn tower, the pools, the golf course, and part of the strip. We were on the 57th floor and didn't hear a peep from the nightclub, which some others have complained about. Room numbers that end in even numbers are strip view. 

Restaurants: A very nice selection, and we made a stop at all of them except Switch. Went to the bar at Sinatra, which has great appetizers [main course menu didn't intrigue me that much] and a polished bar staff who made fine traditional cocktails and are always ready with a suggestion. There's also a very cool huge model ship hanging over the bar. Wazuzu has the spectacular crystal dragon along one wall and a fine pan-Asian menu. Society cafe was good for breakfast and the Lobby Cafe and Bar is just off check-in if you can't even make it to the elevators before you need a drink. Best of all is steakhouse Botero, which was slam-packed the night we were there but still offered tremendous quality on every course. The bone-in NY Strip is something special, as is the salmon with Meyer lemon appetizer and the side of truffled corn pudding. Deserts are more creative than anything, so choose carefully if you're a dessert traditionalist. There's also a great bar up front here; if Kirk the bar manager is working, ask him to make you his martini with pear vodka and elderflower liqueur.  

Random notes: It's a pretty easy walk to Wynn down a hallway by the theaters, past a shopping arcade where they would turn you upside down and shake the money out of your pockets. Won $165 in ten minutes at a single-deck blackjack game, but I promise I didn't let that influence my review. Nothing here is a particular bargain, but I wasn't expecting it to be, so...

Elsewhere on the Strip: You can skip the bar at the Trump tower. Dull. The wine list at Mix at THEhotel isn't as good as it used to be, but the food is. CityCenter is getting near completion on the exterior, and is just enormous. Can't say it really advances architecture on the Strip, though.",1,0,1

Here's the letter (the 5000 characters that would fit) I sent to Brian Gullbrants, the ex operations head of The Ritz who now works for Steve Wynn at Encore. Needless to say I have not received a response in well over a week - not a good sign for a company who should pride themselves in superior customer service...

Brian,
I had booked two rooms online. I intended on having my 3 guests split into two guests per room. I assumed a double bed would not be an issue, but just to make sure I telephoned your hotel the day after my internet reservation. I asked for two double beds, a high floor and connecting, non-smoking rooms. After confirming this with my colleagues, they asked if I would change the reservation to ""smoking"" rooms. So, the next day I telephoned and made the change. But upon arrival I waited in a ""check-in"" line for 25 minutes (with bags) only to find that none of my requests had been entered into your system. Too boot, none of my requests were available. My guests would have to sleep on roll-away beds. Good Lord! 45 minutes later I was able to secure 2 rooms (non-connecting) with double beds. The only catch, I would have to wait for an hour in order for the second room to open up.
Okay, now all four of us are up in the first room. Let me put a few sodas I brought into the fridge. Nope. Not allowed. Fridge full. Don't touch items or you may be charged! Are you kidding me? Your mark-up is so high on these items you actually care if a few go missing? And you're willing to inconvenience your customers to do so? Sure I could call housekeeping and order a refrigerator for $25 a day (!), but since your room rate is up in the 10th percentile for Vegas these days I would think that wouldn't be necessary.
I guess I could just use ice, but there are no ice buckets. Another phone call to housekeeping. Knock knock... ice buckets delivered WITHOUT ICE. Who does this? This is so bad in the eyes of ""customer service"" that I couldn't make this up if I tried. After the walk to get ice I received a call from the desk staff. My second room was ready; would I like to come down 61 floors to pick up my key? No, please deliver it to me for the hassles you are putting me through thank you very much. Did I have to ask?
I'll try to keep the rest of the trip short but here are the highlights:

* $27 burger delivered to room. Was asked if I wanted the ""included"" veggies. Yes, why not, I'm paying out the nose for them? Oh, I see, the veggies you brought were old and you thought maybe if I didn't really want them you could save yourself a trip down to the kitchen. Lovely.
* Cotton swabs had a dead bug in the packaging. Threw them out (after I took a picture; please let me know if you want it). Unfortunately, the swabs were never replaced. Glad I brought my own. I can only imagine the hassle to call for extras (and what you might charge).
* Time for breakfast. Order in? Sure, I'm on vacation. $75 for the two of us. American breakfast I think you call it. A bit skimpy on the juice if you ask me - especially for the price. We almost thought you had forgotten one carafe... until I ordered breakfast the next day and received an even smaller carafe of juice. Do you carefully measure them out in teaspoons? Seriously, for the money I'm spending (and I don't have a problem spending money - or bringing in my gambling friends) I'm sure feeling nickel and dimed. I almost forgot... would I like a newspaper with my last breakfast? Why sure I would, thanks. I'm sure you can guess... it was never delivered.
* Okay, time to check my email. Nope, that's not free either. In fact, nothing extra was free at the Encore. I didn't get a chance to go to the gym, but my guess is there would be a charge.
* Back to the snacks and snack sensors. Your sign says 60 seconds may elapse before being charged, but the staff member that came by each morning to check the stock (!) laughed when he told me in only 15 seconds I might be charged. Had I known I would have asked they be removed from the room. Sure enough, I was charged for two snacks I never consumed (or moved).
Brian, I could go on and on, but to be honest I lost track of all the issues I had with your hotel. 
I'm not looking for a free stay, hell; you couldn't pay me to stay at Encore again. What I do want to know is how the former Vice President of Operation for the Ritz-Carlton, a man quoted saying:

* ""Consumers' expectations of luxury are changing. It's not about going to the white tablecloth restaurant with the waiter in the tuxedo and the white glove. More often now we see customers that want to relax and enjoy luxury on their terms, not the industry's terms.""
-and-
* ""It's really giving the customer what they want, how they want it, before they even know they want it.""

can allow this to occur. Please explain to me how the Encore embodied anything resembling what you purvey during my stay?

Thank you,

It is true, the hotel room was not as 'long'\/grand"" as The Venetian or Pallazo. But the simplicity of the design and the atmosphere triumph over.
The Bed: Amazing. The room is wide enough that you won't get too disturb if your friend snored. 
Plus, you can listen to your i pod\/nano. It charges too.
Location: next to Pallazo, Venetian, Wynn. Across from The Trump, Treasure Island and Fashion Show mall. Depend on which side of the hotel, I can see Treasure Island show at night from my room.
Closer to China Town. Beat the traffic.

I have very high exepctations and so I was quite disappointed with the service at Encore. When you shell out that much money, you expect more. I got there around 10:30 AM on a Friday and let's say the check-in counter line was amazingly long. You would expect them to have more front desk people for the rush. I had to wait almost half an hour before getting help. They told me that there was no adjoining rooms available. I told her that I ask for it 3 times. It was noted on my reservation. I sent an email asking for adjoining rooms, I spoke to reservations 2 times and asked for adjoining rooms. And no adjoining rooms!!! 

When the rooms were finally ready, I was amazed at the decor. It was beautiful. The beds were plushy and ohhhh it feels soooo good against your skin. The pillows were huge and ohhh so comfy. I loved it. The bathroom was really nice and roomy. Bathrobes were soft - somewhat thin but really feels good. The bath towel were big but not quite soft like I expect it to be. The soaps smell of lemongrass....so soothing and calm. I love their lotions and shampoos. 

Overall the room itself is great. I was really impressed. Until the knob on the shower came crashing down to the floor as I was trying to turn off the shower. UHmmmm....not soo good. 

You can hear the music from XS even from the 18th floor. Hmmmm....in Vegas you are supposed to out and partying til 5 in the morning. Sooo...no complaints there. I got the view of the strip. The night lights were amazing. Love it!!

Down to the cafe for my morning croissant and mimosa....The croissant was excellent. Big, buttery, and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. For $4, it was worth it. 

The pools are really nice. The pool attendants were kind and helpful. Plenty of towels. The European pool was okay. Not too many naked ladies but overall some decent hotties around. Overall a plus for the pool area. 

Off to XS, supposedly the club to be at. The ladies in their skimpiest outfits and the men in their going out clothes......the line oh sooooo ever long. I wasn't surprise that this club would be happening on a Saturday night but the lines were long. I mean long. We got there roughly around 9:45 and one look at the line would just make you want to walk away. $20 for the ladies and $30 for the guys. If you are a guest at Encore or Wynn, the guys get in $20. Must show room key. If you love clubbing, then is the place to be. You can dip your feet into the pool which is nice. Drinks are pricey so expect to bring a lot of cash. 

Dining - Make reservations way ahead of time!!! 

Check-out lines were super long. I did the express check-out. Way easy. You'll find the form in the desk drawer. The tv check-out did not work at the time. They did not offer a late check-out. 

Overall experience - probably will not stay at this hotel again. My search for a great hotel experience continues....",1,0,1

I'm not fond of the layout of either this nor its adjoining Wynn, we always get so lost so easily and finding our car after XS is not fun when you're on a good buzz (don't worry, we have DD's).

Tables here are hit or miss, mostly miss, but friendly dealers.

Slots are like highway robbery, no matter the denomination or bet, so I steer clear of those now.  Definitely wish I had used a players card back then, who knows what offers I missed out on.

My parents stayed here a few times and have had pleasant experiences, but nothing to really draw them back in (my mom prefers Aria now and my dad prefers staying at home, lol).

We'll see, we don't like the changes so much for mLife, so the Wynn\/Encore might be our new home next year.",1,0,2

The whole experience on the Wynn property has captured my loyalty. 
From the sleep quality to the casino, everything is classier and nicer at the Wynn. Even the people staying here were more polite and better behaved than I have experienced at other properties, plus it is a smoke free hotel everywhere outside of the casinos and you can surely tell as it smells cleaner

We were upgraded from a regular Tower suite to a 1400sq ft room that provided a stunning view and felt like we were in our own penthouse. We booked this room with our American Express Centurion Black Card which offered us some pretty great perks including $80 day per couple in free breakfast and more

The restaurants and the buffet were once again better quality than other properties I have stayed at.The Buffet may have been the best buffet we have ever eaten at which may be why we went back daily over the week we were there

If you can afford the 40-60% more costs to stay here over like the Luxor or MGM I would highly suggest you to do so

The only negative is you are located on the complete other side of the strip than Mandalay convention center if by chance you are in Vegas for a trade show

But that is one negative to 100 positives. We loved staying here",0,0,0

We were so excited when pulling up at the hotel for we were exhausted after our long drive and ready to check in and enjoy ourselves. We get inside, check in, and immediately go to our amazing suite. We showered, got dressed, relaxed a little and put our things away. Then we left the room and went downstairs to have a few drinks. We walk up to the bar we ordered our drinks and I handed them my ID and credit card to open a tab for us. While waiting for drinks my friend and I relax and talk amongst each other, then I look behind me and I am surrounded by security. They snatch me up and harass me and humiliate me in front of everyone at the bar. Two out of the about 8 security proceed to say... ""where's your room key"" (I give it them), ""how'd you afford this room""?, ""Is your sugar daddy paying for it""?, you know prostitution is illegal right""?... and he proceeds with many other nasty comment. The bartender kept my I'd and card and gave it to them, no drink or anything. My girlfriend is yelling to be babe what is going on. They won't let me go. This ruined the whole rest of my night in Vegas for they did it give me my items back until the following day when I had to call my parents to confirm my identity and that I am not a prostitute. The next day when in the process of trying to get my belongs back, I met 1 nice security guard that helped me get it back, he told me that he knows that I'm not a prostitute. He said I was profiled because I was black,beautiful, had on expensive clothes, and a nice bag and watch. He told me how racist Vegas is and to be very careful. He helped me retrieve my belongings. And we left the hotel immediately even though I had paid for 4 nights. I was so hurt, humiliated, and distraught; I just wanted to get out of there! We left and check in at another hotel down the strip. The management did nothing about this manner besides sending an apology email. It's sooo sad that my first Vegas experience with my girlfriend was HORRIFICALLY Ruined for ZERO Reason because of this hotel! I haven't been to Vegas since and have no desire to go anymore, thanks to Encore. And my poor girlfriend has been scared for life. Thanks a lot Encore!

The tower suites have there own separate check-in and entrance which is perfect because the regular check in line is ridiculously long at times. We were assigned a host for our stay. She was so helpful and accommodating. She even sent up a plate of fine chocolates and a card for my boyfriend on his birthday. Our room itself was on the 15 floor. We had a nice view. The room itself was really nice. I like the decor but I think they could have done more with the art. I loved the layout. I think we spent most of our time on the craps tables. So we didn't see much of our room. The made came twice a day and cleaned the room. I love when hotels do that. The hotel itself is truly amazing. I really enjoy the decor in the Encore. I love the crowd as well. Classy with a dash of sex appeal. The staff was wonderful. I even enjoyed the staff at craps tables. Most of them were originally from New York, which is awesome! On our last day we booked a cabana by the pool and lounged. I really liked the pool area. I didn't like the awkward wind. It was so windy that day, most people just laid out. If you can book a cabana I recommend it. I watched the guests. Most chairs were taken. The cabana had a fridge, plasma screen, radio, towels, and free refreshments. I will be back again.

I was appalled at the level of service I received after I found a disgusting used tampon in my bathroom on check-in.

- when I called front-desk using button, she offered to move me to new room and to come down and get new key from manager's desk left of check-in agents (later found that I did not need to switch elevators to get to new room, and manager's desk was unstaffed when I went down there apparently because when you hit ""Front Desk"" it goes to a call-center offsite so they have no idea what is going on in the hotel.  This is not a 5-star experience.  What, do they fly in the housekeepers from India too?)

- The new room was exactly the same as the before one, and the desk manager Miguel was completely unsympathetic, and poorly trained in the art of hospitality.  By offering nothing except for ""late checkout"" (are you kidding me), I could tell that the hotel didn't really much care about what I had experienced.

-Nevermind the fact that I have never seen a used tampon in a hotel room at any star-level of hotel, even a motel 6.  Imagine if this was your honeymoon and you came in and saw that.  

-I contacted the event organizer at the bulge-bracket investment bank I am associated with, and recommended that they not use this hotel again.

After reaching out to security, claims, and guest relations; the outcome was beyond disappointing. More effort should have been made by Encore as I do not tolerate theft. Nor do I accuse unless I am certain of a crime. It's too bad, really, since many pleasant employees work at Encore. However, it only takes one bad apple to poison a hotel experience.

Granted I booked this last minute and did not really cared where my finace and I stayed as long as it is clean and had decent place to sleep. I booked this trip for a last minute mile run for my airline elite status before the end of the year. I arrived thinking this is another one of those glitzy Vegas hotel exterior with passable rooms but I was happily surprised to find a really well designed modern suites, there is really no need to up-grade at all! 

The bathrooms features dual sinks, separate shower, large tub, and toilet with a door. The ladies will really love the lighted 20X magnifying make-up mirror and vanity seat. The living room\/study has a nice L-sofa with ottoman, desk with enough room for 2 laptops (because we always work during our vacations), and an amazing view of the strip. 

The bedroom has a large comfortable king size bed with a flat screen TV, remote lighting system, and remote shades. 

 I have lived in many hotels throughout the world and I have to say this is one of the nicest hotel rooms I had ever been to without demanding for an upgrade. The overall tone of the rooms are soft beige walls with black trim framed white ceiling and decorated with modern art. Almost like a Chanel showroom. This hotel room is so nice that I am taking pictures of it and having my contractor to remodel my home to its design.

There is another tid-bid of information that will help you book this hotel and that is, the Wynn has the best looking client-el. Wynn targeted young professionals in the upper to mid income range and middle aged upper income individuals who enjoy luxury and do not mind paying a little extra for it. When I said best looking, I did not mean that everyone in the hotel look like they should be in a movie with Brad Pitt but they are well dressed individuals that look like they have well to do. Normal attire on the casino floor are polo shirts and khakis sprinkled with some individuals in sports jackets\/suits. The ladies are usually dressed in the latest west coast fashion and high heeled Christian Louboutins ready for the clubs or a show. Very different than the MGM grand and Circus Circus chest high jeans crowd.

SERVICE: While professional and courteous, it's not on par with a Four Seasons or similar hotels that emphasize the ultimate in customer satisfaction. My dad and I went out to the pool area on an overcast day, with maybe a third of the chairs in use and all the cabanas empty. Wanting to cool off for a couple minutes, we walked into the pool and took a seat on these big round seating things they have in the water. Within two minutes, a lifeguard came over and said, ""I'm sorry, these are for cabana guests only."" There were six of these huge seating things in the pool, each one capable of seating 8-10, and not a single person was on them. There weren't even any cabana guests to use them. And you're seriously going to kick us off them?! That's just poor service and bad business. After getting asked to get off, two other ladies in the pool said, ""Yeah, isn't that terrible? We were sitting there this morning and they kicked us off, as well."" Moments like that leave a bad taste in guests' mouths, and they pass on such stories to others, quickly leading to bad word-of-mouth.

POOL: The pool area is pretty small. The adult pool, with a bar and gaming, is very nice, but the regular pool is pretty boring. I'm a sun-worshipper, but for those who like some shade, there is NONE at the main Encore pool. Poolside dining is another disappointment. The prices seem very reasonable, even cheap for such a nice hotel, until you realize the food is pre-packaged from the Lobby Bar & Cafe. With food like that, you're better off grabbing a Subway $5 footlong and taking it out to the pool. Overall, I prefer the Wynn pools to Encore.

LOCATION: Encore is pretty isolated at the far-north end of the Strip (yes, there's some stuff further north, but The Sahara and Circus Circus are not places most high-end hotel guests will frequent). If you have a car or are willing to cab it, you're fine, while getting around by foot is doable but not easy (Encore connects to Wynn, then you can take the bridge to Palazzo, which connects to Venetian, and from there you can cross the street to TI, which connects to Mirage, in the middle of the strip).

Now for the positive news.

HOTEL\/CASINO: The design is spectacular, like the Wynn. However, avoid Encore at all costs if you don't like the color red. Whereas Wynn is decked out in neutral brown, Encore is totally and completely red, red, red. It's far too much of a non-neutral color, IMO, but I can let that go when the details and intricacies of the design are so stunning. From the crystal peacock tails to the Daphne statue in the Lobby Bar, you can tell how much thought went into every single design detail. The casino is small and intimate, but beautiful, with natural light all around.

SUITES: Pretty close to perfect. The huge rooms are modern and sophisticated, in neutrals like black, beige, and white. Everything is top-of-the-line, from the big things like the beds (the best you'll find on the Strip) to the small things like the Kohler faucets. While these are bigger than the rooms at Wynn, they kind of feel smaller, because of the partial wall in between, but I like them better. The bathrooms are huge and gorgeous, too. I think I have to give the Encore rooms the edge over Palazzo, making these the best rooms on the Strip, IMO. As for the noise problem from XS, I purposely chose to stay at Encore on nights when the nightclub was closed, so I can't comment about that noise. However, the rooms were very quiet, and I heard no noise from outside the hotel or from the hallways\/other rooms.

*** TIP ***: For stunning views of the Strip, request the south side of the hotel, with rooms on the west side of the hall (we had rooms 18 and 20, which were perfect).",3,0,0

I was so impressed with my entire experience the 4 nights I was there that I don't think I'd ever want to stay anywhere else. First, the people-- the concierge, the elevator door men, the staff at the club inside Encore (Surrender), housekeeping, and the room service people were all extremely friendly, and seemed to be just genuinely happy to make their guests feel welcome and pampered. I didn't get to try the spa, but next time I go, it's on my list of to-do's.
Oh- and one other thing about housekeeping that impressed me more than any other housekeeping experience was that the first morning they cleaned, they put my makeup brushes and liners (which were sprawled out across the countertops in the bathroom) in extra provided glasses, and they neatly organized the rest of my makeup containers across a clean hand towel. Talk about freaking service!!

As for the food inside Encore, Jardin was good. I had the crab cakes, filet, and butterscotch pudding-- which was excellent. We also ate breakfast at the Encore Lobby Bar; the bacon egg and cheese croissant was amazing- best croissant I've ever eaten in my life. And literally everything about the buffet was fantastic! Nothing tasted like it had been sitting around for hours, everything tasted very fresh and made from scratch. Love!

With an attitude she said ""you already got a free upgrade so we can't give you anything"". I quickly replied ""who said I wanted something for free?""  I simply wanted a better room which I could and would've paid for. 
-note we did get a free upgrade through our BlackCard which is partly why we also like staying here, but it's more of a perk, we have other options too. 

She said she'd send security up to investigate, but like I read in other reviews, THEY NEVER ARRIVED.  Security was also supposed to escort us to our new room to make sure it was ok, but no security. 

She also stated that the pot could be coming from anywhere and it was common. Apparently Encore is admitting guests who frequently smoke pot in their rooms now. If you are a Clean NON-Drug user such as myself, you may want to look at a different hotel. 

Fast forward to tonight, a night we spent gaming and trying to ""enjoy"" our casino.  First I'm 29yrs old, but admittedly prob look older, but not younger.  EVERY time I switched to a new table I was carded and scrutinized to ensure I was over 21.  It gets a little old when you literally move to a new table just 10 feet away. After being carded 8 times at 8 tables within a 25ft radius, we decided to stop gaming and head over to WYNN for food. 

While waiting for our food we decided to play $20 on 2 hands of blackjack and see how it goes. After giving the dealer my $20, both the id's because I knew the drill, and showing him my ""red card\/room key"" the guy keeps staring at me and my ID.  I was like seriously???  I said I'm 29, what's is the problem?  He replies I know you're 29, I just need by pit boss. (meanwhile she was nowhere around so we were just supposed to sit there and wait) I said again for what, what is the hold up?  With more rudeness and attitude he looks for her again. 
I angrily said screw it, picked up my money and demanded my ID's back. 

We then sat back at Allegro waiting for our food to finish, and I was looking over seeing him replicate with his hands what had just occurred with us, and was obviously talking sh*t about me.  I rushed over and requested the pit boss speak to me.  I asked ""are the dealers capable of determining if a California ID is valid and Checking age?"" She replied absolutely yes. I then explained what happened and layed into her pretty hard about the whole situation. Then the stupid dealer was looking over at us and smirking like he got me or something.  I was infuriated, and I admit the pit boss was kind, apologized and said she'd consult her manager about it.   

This is how they treat their guests that stay here and game here and eat here as much as I do. I've spent 10's of thousands of dollars here and that's how they treat me?  

I was still steaming and went to my front desk at Encore on my way back to my room. I explained my frustrating with their gaming, and how unprofessionally I was treated. The front desk Employee with serious attitude told me: ""that's an issue with gaming, we are the hotel only"". I abruptly replied ""so you're telling me, that if my stay here in your hotel is adversely affected by my harassment in your gaming, there's nobody on the hotel side that I can talk to, and if I decide to never stay in your hotel again because of these constant issues, there's no manager in your hotel side that would care?""   She again with more attitude told me to talk to gaming, there's nothing she cares to do. 

After yet another customer service F-off basically, I decided to call Encores phone number and request to speak to their customer relations dept.  When the girl answered, she told me no. I replied: "" so you have no customers relations team that handles customer satisfaction issues?""  She literally laughed at me over the phone and told me it was 2:30 am and that dept is closed.  IN A CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS HUH?  Wow. Encore, you have let me down on so many levels this week. 

You have insulted me, you've allowed employees to harass me, and you've shown you do not care about your loyal customers. Well to this I tell you my loyalty is gone, and I'll be sure to spread the word.",3,0,0

The rooms and pools and casino were all fine--but that's it, fine is not good enough.

Encore is fine and if it was closer to the action, I'd rate it one more star, but being stuck out where it is makes it a pain to get around.  SO if you want to just stay within the Wynn and Encore, it is fine, but when in Vegas, I'd rather not be stuck at one place.

When I checked in I was offered the $20\/nite upgrade for a panoramic view as others have mentioned and when I got the room, I had a great view of massive parking lots and construction cranes.  A horrible view.  Yes, on the 56th floor, but horrible all the same.  I called down and the person I spoke to admitted yes, many people do not like the view and she said because of the Wynn, ""Encore really does not have any great views"". she agreed to ""downgrade"" me back to my original price at a lower floor.  Which ended  up having a MUCH better view of the pool, but if you have been to the hotels down Las Vegas Blvd. (Paris, Caesars, etc.) they have MUCH better views than Encore.",0,1,0

The room accommodated all six of us very well with a bed, a sofa that was surprisingly comfortable, and a roll away bed that I don't think we had to pay extra for. The room itself was very nice with floor to ceiling windows,  the view was basically just the Wynn hotel across the way, the pool, and a parking lot. 

The room had a large bathroom with a small flatscreen TV by the sinks that I don't think ever turned off. Of course, the decor and layout was all very nice and we got it at a good price (about $150\/night).

The room service was actually very good but the Encore and Wynn both have some great restaurants so unless it's really late, there isn't much reason to use it.

As stated above, two of the main flaws were the crowds here which were definitely much older and more family oriented (even at the pool) for the six of us, and the fact that it is essentially at the end of the Strip but taxis are plentiful in Vegas.

One major downside that I saw to such a high end hotel was that they charged for their Internet in 24 hour increments of $14.99. I have stayed at Marriotts and Holiday Inns where they have free Interent, so why not Steve Wynn's Encore? It can't really cost them that much and I'm sure aside from uploading some pictures and checking the occasional email the Internet is not the first thing on anyone's mind in Vegas. It just would have been a nice touch.

The rooms here are really nice, but if you are expecting a party hotel everyone seems to recommend the MGM.",0,0,0

I always, adore ""themed hoteks"" in vrgas, but then there comes a point where it becomes obvious how artificial it is, that it becomes tacky.

Then comes Encore hotel where the ""theme"" is simply, timeless elegance. NO! I am not talking about archeic style, but an emphasis on timelessness.

What i love about Encore, is the detail of their interior design.  It is timeless, as I said, but non referential. There is no reference from the past decade; it is modern yet timeless---- forever lasting.

As you drive in to the valet, you will by greeted by evergreen plants and manicured flowers, the canopy in the driveway is a classy pattern of black and white stripes.

As you eneter in the the foyer, an unannoyingly lipstick red carpet is rolled for you, with giant patterns of paisleys and flowers. 

The check-in area wall is lavished with humongous scarlet floral porcelains.

In my suite, I got my own bedroom, living room, massage room, walk in closet \/ bathroom, personal buttler, and concierge, who were on my beck and call.  All my need, was on the touch of a dial. From my tea, to my car, or to just anything else, even as simple as asking for another loofah.

My hubby and I stayed here last weekend for our anniversary.  This is mostly an adults-only property, in that it does not cater to children, so their parents will most likely be discouraged from staying here.  One of the most apparent signs: ""No Strollers allowed"".  We thought this was great because we came here as a getaway from our kids, ha ha :)  I think that since Vegas is an adult playground, there should be some places that are reserved just for adults. That being said, if you do decide to stay here with your kids, they will probably be bored to tears as there are no waterslides in the pool, no kids program or arcade.  I also did not see a kids' menu in the restaurants we visited.  As for property amenities, the spa and fitness center were absolutely goregeous!  It was tough to leave.  The casino had plenty of slots and table games.  However, if you are looking for $10 blackjack, you will have to go elsewhere.  We mostly saw $25 min with a few $15 min. sprinkled about.  I think this is an attempt to keep the rif-raff out.  Mr. Wynn, thank you for attempting to keep some class in Vegas :)  If you plan to visit nightclubs, I hear XS is the best.  We went to Surrender because we had front-of-the-line passes.  This was a nice place.  The inside portion is pretty small, so we spent most of our time outside by the pool.

They even print your name on the hotel key cards!

The suite itself is gorgeous, with fantastic views of the strip from the floor to ceiling windows. The beds are heavenly as well with down comforters and tons of pillows. The bathrooms are huge, with marble tubs and plenty of space to stretch out and get ready for a night out. 

We also had room service both nights we were there and were so impressed by the friendly service by our guy, Rigo. He brought us tray after tray of delicious late night munchies with a smile on the whole time. 

Whenever we needed extra anything - towels, blankets, forks, whatever - it came super quickly. 

And that's just the room itself. One of the best parts about Encore is that you could literally stay there all weekend if you wanted to and not even bother with any other parts of the strip. From the pool to the clubs to the restaurants and casinos, Encore is top notch.

It is an AMAZING hotel in that all rooms are essentially mini-suites.  It's apparent that Steve Wynn spared no expense in ensuring maximum comfort for Encore guests, I highly suggest going on to their website to see pictures of the suite as words do not do it justice.  Aside from the suites, the hotel has fantastic restaurants that will not bore the palate.  Cafe Society is great for brunch (I kept going back for Bloody Mary and French Toast).  Botero is a contemporary steakhouse that is booked full every night so be sure to make reservations ahead of time.  XS is currently the hottest nightclub in town with a spacious dance floor that opens up to the Encore pool area where cabanas are set up for seating. As I was leaving XS at 3 am I noticed that there's still a line out the door!  

Staying at Encore definitely added to my Vegas experience.  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the location.  It is on the strip but getting anywhere takes some patience.

Always greeted with a smile and very professional staff. Okay, our housekeeper one day refilled our ice bucket - I've never had a housekeeper perform at that level of service. The beds - oh my goodness - just crawl in, use the electronic pad next to the bed to close the lights and the drapes, and you'll sleep for days. Seriously, where can I buy one of these beds!?!

Staff - 4 stars - We had limited staff interface since we stayed for two nights, thus, didn't ask the staff to come clean the room.  The only interface we had was during check-in.  The front desk reception was helpful and advised us due to our room's location, the night club sound may be loud.

Cleaniness - 3 stars - I gave it a three stars rating because the shower had multiple mold spots which I was not impressed.  No, we did not call Housekeeping to come clean it because I know harsh chemicals would have been used in order to remove it.  Other than the mold in the shower, everything else was fine.

Amenities - 3 stars - The exercise room closes at 8pm.  I know, I know - Who comes to Vegas to work out?  After a long day of walking around and buffet bingeing, we simply wanted a place to stretch those muscles.  So, I say 8pm was way too early!",4,2,1

The rooms are very spacious with separate bedroom and living area.  Everything in the room was very cleaning including bathroom.  

There are many restaurants throughout the Encore and the Wynn.  They offer the basic deli to the award winning formal restaurants.  If you are in Vegas and hungry check out the buffet at the Wynn for dinner.  It has many different stations including a seafood station with all you can eat king crab legs.  All you have to do is eat 1 or 2 pounds of crab legs in order to get your money worth at the buffet.

The Spa at the Encore is the nicest and largest I've ever experienced.  It is very private and everyone is very professional.  The Spa includes a sauna and steam room, 2 hot tubs and 2 cooling pools along with many other amenities.  For additional information see my review of the spa under The Spa at the Encore.

Well, ok, maybe if you received bad service or had a terrible experience. But customer service is really good there for the most part. Other than that, this is my most favorite hotel resort on the strip. From the decor of classic red and off-white colors and chandeliers hung above a high ceiling, to the scent of the hotel once you walk in. It gives me such a nostalgic feeling. 

Asian theme hotel. Mr. Wynn loves the Asian culture so it's only right to open a hotel with Red colors and have a restaurant in the hotel called Red 8. The lucky number 8 in the Asian culture. 
Home to the hotness night clubs, XS, and the day club pool party, Encore Beach Club. I always have the best time at these venues, not forgetting Tryst. Rooms itself is spacious and the beds are amazingly comfortable. 

I came in this trip to meet with a potential job offer in Special Events. The meeting went very well. We shall see if this will be the right fit for me in this city.",1,2,1

The rooms were lovely, well appointed, and comfortable...very similar to the Wynn but different decor.  The suites are not as large as those at theHotel or the Palazzo, but are just as nice and comfortable.  The check in desk is very close to the entrance off the parking garage and the elevators are close-by, too, which makes getting in and out easy.  Great views of the pools, golf course and Strip, also.  The coffee bar served wonderful breakfast sandwiches!  I liked that the hotel is a little smaller and more low-key than the Wynn, but you are still so close to the action.  I also loved the Adult pool (topless bathing optional) w\/ great service, it's own bar, lots of seating, and water coolers everywhere.  The staff came around to offer us free water bottles and fresh fruit one afternoon, which was a nice surprise.

I've stayed here a couple of times before with a bunch of other people in the room, but on my most recent Vegas trip for my 23rd birthday this month, the best friend and I decided to just get a room to ourselves. We were willing to let friends come to our room to pre-game or just to hang out, buttttt, we weren't down to have others stay in our room in case of drama. Long story, short, it was worth paying more just so we could have our own room, separate from our other friends.

Anyways, I love Encore. The service here is amazing. On our recent trip, we checked in at around 3:30 and there wasn't a line or anything so we were helped immediately. They very much personalize your trip - I mean, you get your names printed on the key cards! I had booked us a king suite, but the concierge offered to upgrade the suite to have two queen beds instead. Win!  We got to our room and it was huge for just two girls. We had stayed in the king suite before, but with a king bed - the only difference is the small window\/wall they have there to separate the living room area and the bed. I like the room we had this time. We had a pretty good view of the Wynn from our room, so no complaints. The bathroom was huge - a spa like tub, along with a shower, occupied one side of the room, while the long marble sink separated the separate room for the toilet. Another thing I love about the Encore are the huge mirrors that are along the entrance of the rooms across from the entrance of the bathroom. We love that because we always end up doing our makeup on the floor in front of them. The beds are VERY nice. It's like sleeping on a giant fluffy cloud! There's other amenities that come with the room too - you have to pay the resort free, which is $25 each night, and included it access to the gym, free wi-fi, and some other stuff.

The rest of the hotel is pretty cool. Everything is super clean and sleek. There's a few restaurants and bars scattered through out below. Tons of different kinds of tables to gamble at. The pool is pretty nice. There's a normal pool on one side and there's also a ""European style"" pool. I also like the fact that it's connected to the Wynn so there's even more shops and restaurants to go too.

The main reason why we love staying at the Encore is that two of our favorite clubs are located right below our rooms! XS is actually in the Wynn, but since the hotels are connected, we still can just walk downstairs and get in line easily. Surrender is our next favorite club and is right downstairs, near the elevators actually. Regardless, we save some money on taxis by staying here and we also save a lot of our time, since if we stayed at another hotel, we'd have to get ready at an earlier time so we can get in line on time. 

Overall, I can't get over how much Encore is my favorite place to stay in Vegas. It's so worth it to spend a little more to stay here and to be honest it's not even that much more if you find a good deal online at a website. Trust, you won't regret it.",1,1,1

Shop for rates and you'll be able to stay here for almost nothing. It's a good hike over to the Wynn so if you want to access everything over there regularly you may be better off staying in that hotel.

Wynn outdid himself when he created Encore, considered the sexy little sister to Wynn right next door.  I was in love from the moment I walked in.  The customer service was impeccable, I mean their innate ability to kiss my ass was phenomenal, leaving me with a feeling of importance and comfortability.  

I came with my family to celebrate an important occasion, my mothers' 50th birthday.  I wanted her to feel special and so I upgraded us to the Salon Suite.  Well, the room was alright...just kidding, it was a palace, a room for the Gods, it was gorgeous, amazing, a touch superfluous, and absolutely perfect.  From the massage room, to the bathroom that is larger than most one bedroom apartments, to the panoramic views of the skyline, every touch was the epitome of class and elegance.  Not only was the room perfect, but not five minutes after we had closed our doors, we heard a bell at the door.  A cake was brought up with candles that said 'Happy Birthday"" and that literally sealed the deal for me.

The rooms are complete with heavenly beds and electric blackout shades. Steve Wynn- you get it, and I appreciate you for that. 

The minimums on the tables can be a bit steep here- so best to avoid the blackjack tables at 5 in the morning. No, I am not speaking from experience.......

When you stay at the Encore, you have access to its pools as well as Wynn's. The Encore pools are a bit better if you are looking for a quieter scene, but personally I really loved the Wynn pools- complete with poolside gambling and a great playlist.

The Hubby and I stayed here during 4th of July weekend and we will come back. This hotel is so beautiful, modern and luxurious! Apon check-in, my husband mentioned it was our wedding anniversary and the nice lady at the desk gave us a complimentary upgrade to a high-floor panoramic suite! NICE. She did warn us, ""You can hear the music from ""XS"" (the nightclub at Encore) and it doesn't stop till 4am."" We appreciated her friendly disclosure and told her ""That's fine, we don't get back to our room until 4am anyway, we'll take it!"" LOL 

The room was immaculate, everything you would expect from a 5 star resort. Spacious living room with a wrap around sofa, ottoman, swivel flat screen TV, ipod dock station, view of the pool & the strip, large comfortable king size bed with Egyptian cotton, large bathroom room with a sit-in tub w\/jets, shower w\/glass panels, large over-sized plush towels, luxurious his & hers bath robes, control panel next to the bed where you can open and close the curtains by the tip of a finger, you can even turn on the ""Do not disturb"" sign by the same control panel by the bed (very helpful). :) There is even a doorbell! Encore really made us feel like it was our home away from home with room service. 

Room Service: Stumbled, I mean came back to our suite at 3am and ordered room service on Saturday night. They picked up after one ring, ""Hello Mrs. C-----, may I take your order?"" Impressive, I ordered one Marguerite pizza and she said the pizza will be delivered in 30 mins. I decided to take a hot shower while I waited for the pizza . The room service arrived on time and they even brought up a pitcher w\/water and two cups and Parmesan cheese and crushed red peppers. I forgot to ask, but clearly they read my mind! The pizza was excellent. 

Pool: Chairs are plentiful. We layed out by the main pool for the 1st day and decided to check out the European Pool the next day. The European Pool is much nicer in my opinion. They only allow 21+older and they allow topless sun bathing (if you want to work on getting rid those tan lines). I had a mojito that was well made, not too sweet and not too strong, they even garnished it with a sugar cane stick ($15 each). They have a DJ spinning top 40 and house music...made me feel like I was at a pool party without having to look at drunk people stumbling all over the place. 

Tables: We played black jack and hubby brought home $300 and I brought home $150 (my 1st time). Total winnings: $450.00 Not bad!

Great service, beautiful common areas, and the room was decorated with awesome amenities.  No complaints regarding that stuff...

However, this stay was one of the...uh...most ""challenging"" we've ever had.  You see, the connected nightclub sits directly between the two towers of this resort.  When the music starts at 10:00pm (and continues until 4:00am!) and you've been placed in one of the rooms overlooking the club and pools, you are in for an experience you will NOT believe.  The windows were vibrating and the bass was so loud that I had to turn the volume up on the television!  After 30 minutes, I was on the phone requesting a move to the other side of the building.  (Initial answer was, ""We're sorry, all I can do is send up some earplugs.""  No kidding, I was told that.  I was persistent, so they eventually 'found' something on the other side and, at 11:00pm, we were moved.). After the move, all was well.  Kind of a pain in the ass, but they were very reactive to my complaint, so they get kudos for that.  

BTW, they told me they always ask guests at check-in if they are ok with noise from the Club.  Sorry, you didn't ask us.  There is NO WAY I would have agreed to that.  No way.   As I write this, I am astounded that, given the level of detail that every other aspect of this resort has been subjected to, that this problem is permitted to exist.  Mr. Wynn, are you aware of this?  C'mon....I love staying here, but I'll be staying elsewhere next time.  This was\/is a deal breaker.

I absolutely love their modern fixtures and the service overall is stupendous.

Their standard King Suites are spacious with dual sinks, a huge soaking tub and a separate walk in shower. Oh and did I mention that all the lights and curtains can be operated by the touch of a button next to your bed (especially useful for those long nights and sleep-in mornings--that's what you get for waking up in Vegas!)

The amenities are great too! The pool area is great to lounge in and get and take a dip on a hot and humid day. Their are also plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from that are all top notch! I'd definitely recommend staying at the Encore.

The only reason I knocked it one star was because the View from my room was looking at the opposite end of the strip with a glimpse of the Stratosphere, Circus Circus, a church and a construction lot. If you can, request a strip view as I hear the views on that end are spectacular.

(Funny, cheaper hotels give away internet. $250 a night places charge.)

That having been said... This place is first class from the word go. The room was stunning. Remote controlled lights. Amazingly comfortable bed.

One tip which applies to nearly every Vegas hotel, if you are not planning to be partying until 5am, ask for a quiet room away from nightclubs, otherwise you will be up all night.

I have nothing but good things to say about this resort casino. You definitely get what you pay for. That being said it isn't cheap but it is definitely worth the price. Customer service is fantastic at every step of the way during your stay.  Staff are very helpful and seemed genuinely friendly. I think detail is where this place stands out. Decor around the casino and hotel is beautifully taken care of. We got the basic king suite and were very happy. Room is a very good size for two people. Bed is very comfortable and it's nice having a semi-separate seating area if you in the room during the day.  I would recommend facing away from the XS night club though if your staying at Wynn or Encore noise is noticeable and if your not a night owl or heavy sleeper it can be annoying. Bottom line this is flat out luxurious nice. Very little to no smell of cigarettes even in casino area. Not much of a gambler so I can't speak to the gaming but table prices are higher than other casinos. Pool at both Encore and Wynn are incredible and match the decor of the rest of the resort. I'm just sad I didn't get to see the entire place since we were so busy. They have some great restaurants I'd like to try as well as night clubs we didn't get to visit.  The only bing that I would complain about are the speed bumps on the way to self parking. The stripping is worn out and I went over the bumps at high speed at night because I couldn't see them. I noticed that this is a problem throughout all Las Vegas though.  Other than that I would highly recommend Encore and Wynn.,0,0,0

They get four stars because of the staff. Otherwise, it would be three. (c'mon yelp, let us give half stars already!!) We stayed in the tower suites area of the hotel, which is the ""VIP"" section. there is a sepearate valet and check in area. There is also a private pool for the tower suite guests ( which after seeing all the pools at both Encore and Wynn) is nothing to write home to mom about. The best pool there was the european pool at the Encore which was filled with americans. The draw is that women can go topless if they want. EVERYONE had on a bikini top.  Weak!!! 

This is a 5 star hotel. One of four on the strip. (Wynn, Bellagio, and the Four Seasons) are the other three. Perhaps its just me, but 5 star means that NOTHING should fall through the cracks. We got room service the first night. Coffee, tea, and cookies. Thats it. $57. Thats crazy talk. That tea better be picked by the hand of Buddha, and Jesus better have made those cookies. DAMN!! The person who brought the table said he would send someone back in an hour to get the table. That table was there until the next day. Same thing the next night. No biggie, but if were VIP then wtf? If I was Mariah Carey, those tables woulda been gone asap.

The room was nice. View of the Encore Beach club which was empty the entire weekend. It costs $80 to get in if you're not a Wynn or Encore guest and $50 if you are. I'll just stick to the free pools thanks, although the ambiance of it from my window looked cool.  Bathroom was a marble delight. Super comfy beds. SUPER NICE valet and cleaning staff. Would i stay there again? Sure, on someone elses dime. On my dime, its ALL about the Palazzo hotel baby. See review for this one below....",2,3,3

I am a very reasonable person, but it absolutely frustrates me how this resorts staff operates. They're all being completely polite without actually helping anyone. I was denied admission to XS nightclub for a total BS reason that was not even true, and everyone that I speak to is not helping me in any way, Just giving me the polite runaround. 

I purchased 4 tickets to XS through the encore concierge (approximately $300) and was denied admission to the club, so when I asked for a refund, I was told it couldn't be possible because I didn't keep the proof of payment stub from my tickets, however, I have various statements (including the final room charge since the tickets are billed as a room charge) breaking down exactly what I was charged and why it was charged to me, but still, they say that since I have no proof of payment, they can't do anything.

It's absolute crap trying to deal with all of these staff members, and it's the biggest shame of all that I can never show my face again at this beautiful resort or give mr Steve Wynn a single red cent. If anyone could just help me get anything straight I'd gladly return a happy customer to this gorgeous resort, but everyone here seems to just give the runaround. Beyond aggravating. Beyond. 
Thank you encore for ruining my relaxing vacation and leaving me more aggravated than ever. 

Also, props to Cody Mcclure of the concierge management team for at least making it seem like he's trying to get something done, you are this resorts saving grace. This man needs a promotion or a raise because he's the only one at this resort that I didn't want to yell at. Still, nothing has actually been done by anyone to make my situation right, but he atleast gave the illusion of trying, whether he did or did not try I will never know. Still, I am never setting foot on this resort again. 

Stay away from this horribly frustrating place and take your hard earned money elsewhere, I wish I would have.",5,2,2

""And why do you expect me to change your room?"" Front Desk Clerk after night of hell

All the quotes are accurate with the first one being directed to my Mexican-American travelling companion who happens to be a Vice President of IT and, not that it matters - GREW UP AND WAS BORN IN THE U.S. - and witnessed by two attorneys who were traveling with us.... and in reference, of all things, to the pronunciation of his own name. 

As this took place at check in and we had 5 days to spend, we thought it better to not make a big deal and move on... although this bitter and completely ignorant comment never left our minds....

And it is NOT an all suite hotel..thowing up a built in credenza with a swivel TV does not make it a suite..it makes it a large room with a built in and a swivel TV... a suite has two SEPARATE rooms with a door inbetween.. 

Add to that the nightclub that kept us awake until 3am.. and we were on the 17th floor...followed by the move at 3am to a LOWER FLOOR.....(what?). Apparently, they must make a lot more money from the nightclub patrons than their guests that gamble and dine and drink at their restaurants because I see now this is a consistent problem!

And since I usually travel solo, they're very affordable.  So staying at the one the upper tier hotels like Wynn or Bellagio had never crossed my mind.  Then one day I got a invitation in the mail from Encore for three free nights and $150 freeplay credit.  How could I pass up the opportunity?

Encore is simply amazing!  Right when I got off the shuttle, I was greeted by the bell hop and by every single employee that crossed my path on the way to my room.  At that point I knew I was in for something special.  The room was very spacious and had a nice view of the south end of the Strip.  I liked how the lights and temperature were controlled by the control panel near my bed.  The bathroom was really nice and came with complimentary robes.

It's always a nice walk going through the Encore Esplanade and Wynn Esplanade with the soothing but upbeat music they play.  And the waitresses here are hot!

It's also really convenient how there's a bus stop right in front to make it easy to go down the Strip and easy return back..

Best thing that happened to me while staying here, I at least won about $200 here for each day I stayed!  All on the same slot machine too, but I'm gonna keep that machine a secret to myself.  Sorry! 

Would I stay again at Encore even without a promo offer?  Probably not simply because of how expensive it can get.  Despite the complimentary stay, I still had to pay a $28 resort fee per night which pretty much added to about $100 with tax.  It was still a bargain though considering that it would've cost close to $1000 without the promo.

All the rooms at Encore are suites. We stayed on the 11th floor and was given the option to have a less noisy room facing away from the club and strip. We opted for the less noisy room because I know I would be annoyed had we spent this much money and the room was extremely noisy. 

I had the best sleep of my life in my room. The bed was amazing and comfortable. I really needed a vacation and this room alone rejuvenated me. The bathroom was spacious, I liked that the shower was separate from the tub. There are mirrors everywhere. The room is very modern and classy. I like being able to control everything from the tablet. I experienced great customer service the entire time from check in to check out. Checking out was extremely quick and easy.

The spa and gym area made me feel like I was in a palace. I have never seen such a beautiful gym and spa area in a hotel. We went to XS for clubbing and enjoyed that as well. I thought the DJ stage would be more spectacular, but it was just average.

For a luxury suite in a luxury hotel, I would expect luxury bath towels.  What we received were sandpaper rough Turkish cotton towels.  Turkish towels are fine but no one in their right mind would choose these towels over anything available at any mass retailer.  Even after asking for and getting some brand new, never been washed in detergent towels, they were still rough.  I say bring your own towels or be prepared for a loofa rub.

Another thing that annoyed us was the fact that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room.  Ok, fine, I could have ordered room service but then I'd have to wait, then get dressed to answer the door and then scrounge a couple bucks for tip.  A $99 a night room at the Days Inn has in-room coffee, why not a $400+ a night room at the Encore.

The last thing that was just wrong was the exorbitant prices for everything.  I know all the sayings about if you can't afford it, don't stay there.  Well, I could afford it and more but there is no way I'd ever pay $8 for a small bag of chips regardless of what my net worth is.  Marking things up as high as they do just feels like thievery to me.  I probably would have bought that $1 bag of chips for maybe $3 but never for $8.  I'm sure that a lot of the thought process in pricing is geared towards the corporate traveler who expenses everything but, even then, it's still one corporation ripping off another.

I am a huge neat freak and this is hotel's cleanliness standards were the most amazing part of my whole Encore experience.  The hotel was cleaned up and down everyday with an anal-retentive attention to detail.  They dusted the chandeliers, wiped off the slots, cleaned the hallways, carpets, and elevators daily!  It was so shocking to see so many workers cleaning the hotel nightly.  I loved the maid that cleaned our room too - she was always super thoughful with putting new bars of soap when it looked a tad bit smaller or just organizing things in the bathroom. Ok that's enough about Encore's standards of cleanliness.

I highly recommend staying at Encore and signing up for a Red Card (it's free).  That way you can get be notified about deals on rooms and earn resort credit.

The bed it self was perfect I had a hard time pulling myself out of it in the morning..I swear to you I could have skipped everything else and just stayed in bed..Did I mention the bed was AMAZING! !

The bathroom was great. It had a deep soak tub but i found it a little short. I'm 5'10 and well it was a short fit, but still very relaxing. The towels were plentiful, thick and oversized which was nice. Although they were a bit rough. Also the bathrobes they provide were in kind of rough shape. One had a weird yellowish tinted stain on it and the terry fabric inside was as rough as the towels. 

Okay so outside of the room the entire resort is beautiful. We ate at ""The Buffett"" and I hate to say this but overall I was slightly disappointed.  The salad portion of the very long buffet was a big let down. The greens were wilted. The ""Red and white quinoa salad was nice. The macaroni salad just made me sad. Very bland and seemed to have been setting out a long time. The highlight was the blue cheese dressing.
The cheese and salami station is worth skipping, nothing impressive. 
The turkey, and prime rib were very good. Especially the turkey.  Very tender and flavorful. 
I also tried the Chipotle bbq meatloaf which was yummy. The kobe beef burger were good. I thought they were a bit on the bland side.  The bbq pork bun and chicken pot stickers were both a big let down. The bun was really, really dry and the filling was almost nonexistent.  
The street tacos were really good as well. 
They have a really nice desserts section my favorite by far was the blood orange Panna Cotta. 

We also got to see the Show ""Showstoppers"" which is basically a musical mash-up of a few different famous Broadway shows including ""Chicago"" (All that Jazz, and Cell block Tango) the latter being my favorite performance of the show.  The also did a number from Cabearet (Money). Damn Yankees (The Game). 
 Hello Dolly (Put on your Sunday clothes)  There were a few other song sung by the lead members inbetween the big numbers including ""Anything I can do"" Which is a really fun number the interaction between the two leads during this song is great. They really played well against each other. The finale was A Chorus Line..I know im forgetting several numbers and that's because they were very forgetable. The one thing that really sucked about the show was Steve Wynn's voice overs..They were completely unnecessary. His booming voice jus takes you right out if the moments of being at an old time Vegas show.

Overall this was a great stay. The staff is not only very helpful and friendly but seem to actually enjoy their jobs.. We will definitely be staying here again..

Everyone knows that the places to be right now are XS and Surrender and well, staying at Encore, both these clubs are literally just downstairs. The other perk of being a hotel guest is that you can purchase your admission to the clubs ahead of time (but not discounted) with guaranteed admission. This is incredible crucial if you're a guy.

The casino is A LOT bigger at Wynn.

There is a cafe downstairs at the Wynn to pickup a quick salad or yogurt while Encore only has this in the morning

The Wynn tub is bigger

The Wynn pool is WAY better

If you are getting a strip view, Encore's strip view is blocked by Wynn.  Wynn is WAY better for strip view.  If you get Encore, just get the golf course view.

Upon arrival, my bathroom door lock was broken, lamps were crooked, stains on the counter tops in the bathroom.  Just didn't seem like what it used to be.

It's still a 5-star resort so it's a lot nicer than most on the strip.

Slot machines seemed really tight.",8,7,6

We paid $139 for a King Suite for two nights and got the third night free.  We upgraded to a strip-view 60th floor for another $50 bucks total.  They did not charge us extra for our toddler, like some Vegas hotels say they do.

The room was big -- would have been nice if the bedroom was actually completely walled off from the rest of the suite so we could close a door when it was time for our 2-year old to go to bed.  We just set up a pack n play in the living room and swiveled the TV to the bedroom and kept the sound low.  We also could have set up his bed in the bathroom and closed that door because the bathroom was so big.  Big tub too, not a full size-two person jacuzzi but a big soaking tub.  TV in the bathroom was cool, but you couldn't see it from the pot unless you placed the mirror on the counter just right.  The view we had was really nice.  It looked directly at the top of the Wynn next door and then to the strip beyond.  Because we were staying at the hotel we were allowed to have a stroller for our toddler.  

Room service breakfast was huge.  We got two omlettes and a giant bowl of oatmeal.  Could not finish it.  Total was maybe $50 - $60.

The pools were pretty good, not fun and exciting for little kids maybe, but still pretty nice, and they were open in mid-December unlike most other hotels in Vegas. I strollered our toddler around the large pool and garden grounds one morning -- nice walk.  

Free self-parking right at the hotel.  No need for valet.

Internet access was like $14 for 24 hours.  Movies were about $13 each.    The large fat screen TV is nice, as are the floor to ceiling windows.",0,0,0

Upon check in I was told that it was only ONE SET...really?

My reservation also stated that I would receive a complimentary ticket to Showstoppers, but when I arrived I was told that the show was dark. When I asked to speak with the Front Desk Manager to see what could be done instead, he walked over and smugly stated that there was nothing they could do, no cash value, sorry (very condescending). I showed him the PRINTED RESERVATION which stated I would receive a ticket and he said that the system didn't show anything.

First off, the room is very nice and better than the Wynn. The bathroom area, remote controls for lighting and drapes, closet space, bed, and lounging area are all stellar. As others have stated, the AC does not cool the bed area. That is the only complaint about the room. A tip for you is to bring your own snacks to the room (waters, bars, etc) as everything is very expensive in the room or an area where you can buy snacks. 

The first day there, we went to the European Pool at Encore and it was very packed with electro music being played the whole day. Drinks are not cheap ( Tip: get the bucket of beers 5 for $35). The wife and I ended up going to the Wynn European pool for the next 2 days and loved it. We got a day bed in the pool on Monday. If you enjoy European pools, Moorea Beach Club has more energy and more women who go topless.

As for eating at the Encore or Wynn, we had lunch at the lobby bar (tapas food) and it was very expensive as are the drinks. (8.00 beers and mixed drinks at 16.00 plus). The next place we ate at the was the Terrace Pointe Café. We had great service and the food was good. ( Tip: get the unlimited mimosas) We also ate at the Wynn Buffet and at Sinatra's at Encore. Both were very good. Other nights we had dinner at Mon Ami Gabi (Paris Hotel) and at Nobu (Hard Rock.)

As fairly regular Vegas goers, my friends and I usually hop around to different casinos to see which one we want to dub as our future home base. We're also a little spoiled and only want to try the best of the best.... so when it came time to book our hotel for this EDC Las Vegas weekend and we hands down wanted to check out Encore. However, after this weekend I do not recommend staying at this hotel because I was disappointed with our over all experience stay.

Yes, it's true the Wynn and Encore have a beautiful hotel, probably one of if not THE most beautiful hotels on the strip. When you hear the the name Encore,  you automatically think of class, elegance and extravagance. However, this review is reflecting various situations that made us feel less than pleased with our stay. 

Example 1: Kelly and I were on our way back from clubbing on the Vegas strip. We walked into our hotel and wanted to take our shoes off. Lots of girls do this... and I'm sure lots of drunkies run through the hotel all the time. Too bad I was completely sober and he picked the wrong person to sass. However, not a problem if there is a shoe policy. The security guard simply didn't come up to us and tell us this. Instead, him and his buddy were making some animal noises. So when I clearly ignored whatever barn yard animal noises were coming from his direction, he ran came up to us. This was our interaction:

Noise: RAWRR COO COO adlfjglaerj (insert unrecognizable animal noise)
Guard as he runs up to me and Kelly as we were rolling our eyes: ""Miss, please put your shoes back on. I tried warning you previously.""
Me: ""Oh?...  Wait, what? That was you? I guess I mistook you for some cow or horse on the loose making such noises.""
Guard: ""OH ermm.. well listen, I tried to warn you to keep your shoes on! You're not allowed to do that.""
Me: ""How was I supposed to know that from the noise you just made, I don't speak barn yard animal and that clearly wasn't English.""
Guard:"" Uhhh.. .uhh well that wasn't me.. it was this guy."" (points to the idiot next to him)
Me: ""But I thought you said THAT you just tried to warn me.. so who's the farm animal? You or him?""
Guard: ""Please put your shoes back on... okay...?""
Me (as Kelly and I are putting shoes back on): ""Oh so you guys do speak English...  wow... so you're telling me to put my shoes by squawking instead of asking me nicely and you're letting this asshole talk to me like he's some kind of pig. Really, all I have to say is WOW. Thanks, don't talk to me like you're a runaway farm animal again. I'm going back to my room because I'm STAYING AT THIS HOTEL. We speak English in Las Vegas, not animal."" and I walked away.

I mean, seriously? All you had to do was ask! We obliged!  If there's a policy, we will follow it and not complain either... but was any of that necessary? I am disgusted with how rude that whole situation was. Guards are supposed to protect hotel patrons (me and Kelly), not let others harass them.

Upon getting back to our room, we wanted to draw a bath in the tub to ice our feet. Umm... how come the whole ledge was dusty? When I called downstairs to have this fixed in the morning, it still wasn't taken care of. I mean we didn't drop a couple hundred bucks for a 5 star hotel to have dusty bathrooms where you could see the grime or to have the security guards who are supposed to protect the hotel guests instead of being rude and annoying. 

Another issue is the resort fee. I actually have no problem with paying for the resort fee. HOWEVER, if you do not clearly state that the resort fee only covers 2 devices for wifi, you cannot charge patrons for this without letting them know first. Also, why is there no reception in your room? We all had different cell phone carriers and we all had little to no cell phone reception in the room. Even with connecting to wifi, our calls were getting dropped.

Lastly, if you didn't purchase tickets to Encore Beachclub or XS at the Wynn, fear not because at 10am you can hear everything from the clubs in your room... even some 30 floors up or more. So, if you like EDM like I do and you don't particularly mind waking up and read to fist pump... you're in the right place. Overall, I really wanted to like Encore... but I'm sure you don't blame me for not being in love. I will say that the hotel and resort area is really beautiful. I love the mosaic tiles and the way they light up the trees. The suite beds are super comfy, there is room to hang out and the view of the strip is beautiful. As a guest, you have access to both Wynn and Encore  privileges and are only a short walk away from Fashion Show Mall. However, these perks do not compensate for all these things that happened to our group just over this short weekend getaway. I think I'll just stick to hitting up the clubs and restaurants in Wynn \/ Encore only.",7,3,1

Husband booked a Tower Suites room and I have to say, I loved having our own private check-in area, lobby, concierge and valet.  It made checking in much more pleasant and getting the car was a breeze.  

The room was beautiful.  Gorgeous floor to ceiling windows with automated open\/close buttons for the drapes.  

I saw a review where someone mentioned the toiletries and I have to agree - this hotel was THE best stocked in terms of toiletries that I've seen.  Soap, shower gel, conditioner, shampoo, cotton balls, files, q-tips, shoe polish, shoe polishing cloth, loofah, hairspray, shaving cream... and I know I'm forgetting some.  

I think the Encore restaurants are just okay.  Wasuzu was just okay and Jardin was pretty good.  We meant to make it to Sinatra but never did.    

Every day when we left the room for the first time (whether it was at the crack of dawn or late afternoon), the room was made up by the time we got back.  The cleaning staff was wonderful about organizing my things without moving them.  

The downsides:  

Our room came with a $30 in-room food credit.  This seems like a nice spiff but the reality is that there's an $8 room service charge, plus tax plus a gratuity which leaves you with about 10 actual dollars to spend.  

The room did not have coffee and ordering it from room service was $12.  

It wasn't until I ordered breakfast the first morning that I discovered all of the ""extra"" charges that eat up the $30 room credit and to not disclose that at the get-go feels scammy.  Also, I had happened to see on the website that our room had a room service credit but nothing was ever mentioned to us.  We had to seek someone out and find out what that meant.  

When I did order that first fateful breakfast, she asked what kind of juice I wanted as the coffee came with tea or juice.  On the receipt, my juice was added separately.  My breakfast of a bagel, coffee and green juice came to $47.  I know Vegas is spendy but come on.  I didn't dispute the charge but if the menu says ""juice"", honor that.  And if you're offering me juice that is beyond what the coffee package covers, say so.    

I believe that Wynn guests had a $30 credit at Tableau as well as access to a private lounge serving coffee and pastries.  That seems like a much better deal to me.",3,1,3

Although connected to the Wynn, the Encore has a separate entry and reception desk and other hotel features. They are located at the far north end of the ""strip"" near the Fashion Show Mall. It is the tall building with the word Encore on the top.

The interior of the hotel is restrained luxury with lavish decoration. There is a strong red theme throughout the hotel likely to attract Asian audiences, but the overall feel of the hotel and casino is bright and open with lots of windows and atriums. Encore has a separate spa with lots of great treatments and a small pool with a family and European (topless!) area. I found the moms and dads in the family area more interesting than those in the adult section, although your results may vary!

The hotel rooms are really, really nice. I stayed in a King mini-suite with separate sleeping and living areas separated by a large HDTV that rotates for both sides. Everything is automated controlled with wall and bedside controls. The interior is clean and elegant with excellent sheets and fluffy towels. I loved the bathroom with a large shower and soaking tub perfect for one. Fitting two people in the shower is much easier!

The casino is much smaller than most with only a limited selection of games. It is nice to get to the rooms without navigating a massive casino area. Encore is connected to the Wynn casino including the use of the same Red Card players club which allows a larger selection of games.

Encore is also the closest hotel to the famed clubs. XS, Surrender, and Encore Beach Club (obviously) are located on property, and hotel guests can book reservations much easier for these hot places.

The biggest downside of the Encore is the location. People wanting to see shows or experience the mayhem of the strip will have to walk or Lyft a lot staying here. However, I found this to be a nice escape from the crazy during my visit and found it very easy to use ride share or walk to most places.

Encore and Wynn have world class restaurants which are reviewed separately on Yelp. Encore has full room service with an extensive menu for those not wanting to leave the beautiful room. Most of the restaurants are priced very high, but you can cross the street to the mall or other fast food options nearby.

This is a true five star resort with extensive and tasteful luxury. You will pay for the privilege, but deals are possible for those who look. Encore is aggressive with their players club and is worth joining. Even if you just wander around and gamble or get a craft cocktail, the Encore is a refreshing and enjoyable alternative to the other strip resorts.",16,9,13

I thought this hotel was quite esthetically pleasing.  We waited to check in and thankfully the line was not as long as some I saw at other hotels on the strip (Bellagio, oh my word).  We walk up to the counter and I am shocked to see my hubby shake hands with the guy behind the counter....they went to high school together (small, small world)...hello room upgrade! :)  Room on the 60th floor (there isn't a 40th as 4 is unlucky in some Asian culture) had a panoramic view.  These rooms are beautiful, brand new, and have some bells and whistles like a tv and phone in the bathroom, shower and separate soaking tub, a flat screen that swivels from facing the bed to facing the sitting room, sheer curtains and blackout curtains controlled by a button next to your bed, in fact you can control pretty much everything important from your bed.  I also thought the doorbell and electronic privacy light instead of plastic placard were a nice touch.  The room was non-smoking and the hotel and casino were properly ventilated so it was nice for non-smokers.  Your hotel room key is also called your ""red-card"" which you use when you gamble and supposedly rack up points with which to get rewards.  Although I played slots and the hubby spent time at the tables were weren't quite big enough players to get much of anything.  I ""spun"" the wheel and all I got was ""$10 for slots"" which I felt was a rip off because you had to put money into the machine to use your ""free"" money....was I missing something??  

Although the Encore and Wynn are pretty much at the end of the strip it is a really nice part of the strip to be at and it wasn't as crowded as other parts further down.  We really enjoyed our short stay in Vegas and a large part of that was due to the Encore!",1,0,0

This beautiful hotel is amongst favorites for an older crowd, for its exquisite beauty and elegant charm, and favorites for a younger crowd like myself, for its natural class and convenient location. 

For a married couple on a romantic getaway, you can relax by the European-style pool with classy adults rather than college kids, also includes a black jack tables for gambling outdoors. You can catch one of Las Vegas' most beautiful shows Le Reve at the Wynn next door. You can eat at various classy restaurants located within both Encore and the Wynn.

For a young and fun crowd, you can hit the Encore Beach Club during the day (keep in mind, though you're staying in the hotel, you may still have to pay). If you need alcohol or chasers, there's a liquor store just behind Encore that's walking distance.  It's also next to a Walgreens if ladies need last minute supplies like eye lashes, to-go flats, etc. If you're on a low budget, walk over to Fashion Show Mall and eat at the Food Court, with many food choices that doesn't go over $10. Then, party at night at various clubs to choose from that are just walking distance! No taxi needed.  Surrender, Tryst (at Wynn), and of course, the infamous XS! And the King Suite with an additional bed was actually able to fit 8 people (ladies I mean). 

- Elegant hotel and rooms
- The full customer service

There were mosaic butterflies all over the marble floors, the casino carpet, the fountains, the roof, the mirrors, and the walls.  All of the chandeliers are red, the reception area is totally red, the carpet is red, this place is sooo red, but I LOVE IT.  I absolutely adore the large red flowers behind the reception desk.  I want to climb over the counter and steal them and bring them home with me.  Service was excellent every single time.  The rooms are tastefully decorated in creams and tans, with floor to ceiling windows.  All of the rooms were suites with roomy bathrooms.  There are about 2000 rooms, but Encore has a boutique hotel feel to it.  The pool area was pretty but not very large.  Encore is attached to the Wynn and you can use the Wynn pool which we did since it was larger.  The shopping was pretty minimal though, with only a Hermes, Chanel, Rock and Republic and a few other stores.  There are several places to eat and a cool club called XS.  The sundries store carries a wide variety of chips and candy, but no Mountain Dew.",1,0,0

I think they had the most high tech rooms with small things that you are like- Yeah this is cool!

The housekeeping personnel were very responsive and went an extra mile. Hell, they even remembered our breakfast in bed preferences! Absolutely, loved it!

Yeah, I've never felt that either, but I would imagine that it would be something like what I felt when my eyes met my room at Encore.  At $160 a night, it was a steal at the end of summer.

Everything was gorgeous and perfect from the friendly doorman to the immaculately clean room.

We arrived and there were three people opening doors for us, greeting us and directing us to the registration desk.  The girl at the desk was super friendly and gave us an upgrade to a high floor room with a strip view because we were there for my bf's birthday.

The elevator does this great gust of wind thing that blows your hair back when you get on, although it's probably not the best if you've spent hours doing your hair.

We go up to the room and we have an amazing view of the Wynn hotel and the golf course.  The strip view is a little bit obscured because of the Wynn but you can make out some of the hotels and things.  I loveeeeeeddddddd that the windows were floor to ceiling with power curtains.  

The lights, the curtains and the privacy light are all controlled from a little panel near the bed and all operate at the touch of a  button.

I could spend another hour describing this room for you, but then that's another huge chunk of text you'd have to read and another chunk of time you're spending NOT IN VEGAS AT ENCORE.

Overall, the hotel was very nice.  The lobby and casino decor is very gaudy, as is the Wynn, but since that's what they're going for, I won't hold it against them.  The hotel rooms and hallways were lovely.  Our room was beautiful and comfortable, although the view of down town Las Vegas left a bit to be desired.  Don't listen to those warnings from the front desk about noise from the club.  Get the view of the strip and wear some earplugs.

The pools were fantastic.  Very beautiful and plenty of chairs to be had.  If it hadn't been so hot we would have stayed out there longer and rented a cabana, of which there are tons.  The casino itself was nice, and smelled good, which is an accomplishment, but not much different than the other hotels in this class.

Although the hotel was nice, our customer service experience was a bit disappointing.  When we checked in, we were offered a selection of about 5 available rooms.  When we chose one on the 34th floor, we got our keys and headed up.  Upon arriving, we noticed a $20 bill and some change sitting on the desk, and then an open bottle of lotion on a table, and when I looked in the bathroom and saw multiple personal belongings on the counter, it was confirmed - the Encore front desk had checked us into someone else's room!  Thank goodness those poor people weren't IN the room when we opened it up.  And thankfully we are honest people and didn't steal their belongings!  

We immediately grabbed our things and left to tell the front desk that they had checked us into an already occupied room.  The woman at the front desk acted flustered and irritated (not really apologetic though) and offered us an upgrade to a panoramic suit (over the regular suit we had booked).  It was basically the same exact room on a higher floor, which afforded me a better view of the Riviera.  Great. 

We also inquired about using the gym.  Your choices are 15 bucks a day per person, or pay the resort fee for all nights you are staying, which was $67 dollars in our case.  No, thanks, that's TWICE what I pay for my monthly gym membership!  Considering how expensive this hotel is, you would think the guests at the Encore would be allowed to have full use of the facilities offered without paying extra.

I also agree with some other reviewers that the food options at this hotel are a let down.  $3.50 for a small black coffee and 4 bucks for a croissant is not the best way to start your day.  We wound up walking across the street to Fashion Show mall for several meals for better dining options at better prices.  I suppose I can include close proximity to the mall as a plus.

As a side note, La Reve was completely amazing, and whether or not you stay at the Encore, it is definitely worth seeing!! 

Overall, the hotel was nice, and as long as you don't mind spending a lot on your trip, you will have a great stay.  Well, if they don't let strangers into your room, that is!",1,0,2

Check in was a little long (in terms of the line) but it was courteous and prompt. The room itself was probably one of the best I've stayed in. Huge bathrooms, good toiletries, lots of towels and a comfy robe are all part of what makes the rooms great. I liked how comfortable the sofa and bed were, though the linens could've been a little softer. I've stayed at The Signature where I remember both the tub to be bigger and linens to be more soft and comfortable. 

Unfortunately, I didn't get to try out the pool areas but it looked good from what I saw walking through the Esplanade and into Wynn. My only complaint is that it is a little ""off the beaten path"" so it'd be best if you expect to just stay within the area or allow for time to get to the other casinos\/hotels. Unfortunately, getting to the Monorail also is a little bit of a trek (across the street at the Venetian) so there's also some planning with how to properly allow for travel time to and from places.",1,0,1

The first room I checked into prior to that had so much perfumed rug cleaner it was hard to breathe, again problems with the front desk changing this.    

Also all the club patrons make the cab lines excessively long.  I was visiting on business and had to leave a half an hour early to make sure I got a cab.    

Also traveling by yourself here seems to be an anomaly.  The restaurant staff at wazuzu made me pay for my meal halfway though so I could go to the bathroom.  This despite having my room number and name on file.  The manager explained that they needed collateral from patrons so they did not walk out.   It was offensive.   

I will stay again at the aria, bellagio, or palazzo in the future.   All three hotels offer an equally high user experience without the high handedness that seems to be pervasive here.",3,1,1

Rooms are super clean and huge. They have it all! They served complimentary water bottles while we waited in line for checkin. This might be a nice touch to have in the room. Only suggestion is the towels are a little rough- which they were fluffier but the bathrooms are on point otherwise.

He also handled our credit card in an odd way. Saying their machines were down made a copy in the back and then kept the paper copy out on the desk? Fees are high at this hotel .$19.99 per device for wifi per day and over $35 for resort fees.  After a frustrating registration, the room was very nice. Staff at the hotel through out our stay were nice and helpful. Encore is just too far and honestly not worth the price. Nothing special here. Security lapse in terms of accessing rooms.

Review #42:
just like The Wynn (and connected to it by a row of high-end stores that I can't even afford to window-shop at), the Encore is elegant, refined, & quite expensive; there are several very nice restaurants that will be glad to take a lot of your money (and have dress codes, by the way); one nice feature is how the modest but beautiful pool & gardens area are visible from the casino, rather than being hidden & separate like at most other places on The Strip; the outdoor entrance is cool & serene, and the hotel check-in and adjacent lobby bar bask in the color red; the casino area is relatively small, and focused on table games over slots; 3 stars for excitement here, but will give them 4 because it's alll just fab to look at; best craft beer bet = just like all high-end Strip properties, they are sadly behind on the craft beer revolution, but there are signs of effort here, especially at Society Cafe",2,0,0

The room... very nice... we had a King suite with a panoramic view.  The view wasn't amazing... we faced the side where you see indoor skydiving and some older buildings. It was alright.. not a nice strip view. Everything was clean, well maintained. 

About two weeks ago according to the valet, Encore starting charging to park. It's $18 for 24 hours. Unless this is a new trend with other hotels, we thought this wasn't acceptable. We stayed a couple of nights... so $36 for parking.  This is the first place we've stayed which charged for valet\/overnight parking. Typically it's been free and we tip the valets when they park\/retrieve the vehicle.  I wonder with the new fees if they are passing it on to the valets?  I would imagine they are losing out on tips now because of the additional parking fees. I felt as if the business decision\/model was similar to the airlines...nickle and dime you for everything.  

Checking in...about 40 min... longest we have ever had to wait... anywhere in Las Vegas. Maybe this was just a fluke and we were unlucky?  Everything facility wise is topnotch. The casino was nice as well. 

Back to the room.. you could hear people in the other rooms. Why parents bring kids ...young kids(infants\/strollers) in particular to Las Vegas I will never know. 

We spent the majority of our time out of the room....so... the noisy kids were not a huge issue... just annoying late at night. 

One thing which didn't sit well was us ... maid service. We had the room serviced, when we returned.. there were crumbs on the couch and the entire room smelled of Mexican food\/onion. I get it... we all need a lunch break... but... at least leave the place as if you were never there.. and not smelling like a giant onion.  We called the front desk and let them know... didn't ask for anything in return... we just wanted to make them aware of the situation.

All in all... it wasn't a horrible stay... it just didn't live up to the what I thought a stay at the Encore would be like. 

Would we stay again... no... for the money... I'd rather stay at the Mandarin Oriental or Nobu. 

So for us... a 3 star experience.",3,0,0

The rooms were super clean. The gaming in this hotel was not crowded. A bit empty and boring. But, when you walk over to the wynn, it's much more lively. Drink service was snail speed. 

The bed was comfy and the amenities in the room were top notch. The only thing that was not working was the ""night light"" in the bathroom. no big deal. just wanted to see how it looked. haha. 

The best part of staying here was the concierge service! If you have a flight to catch, they'll check you in & print out your boarding passes for you. no fee!

This is our second night here and now she's had to pull the cushions off onto the floor and piled blankets and sheets just to try to get comfortable. I called about a roll away bed.

The ugly.  The service blew.  From the checkin line, to the complete lack of room service(room never made up), to the fact that I was put in a SMOKING room.  Yes, they do exist and if you're not careful, they might put you in one too.

I didn't get a chance to test my luck on their slot machines, but I did stay in their suite for a night. The room is very luxurious and spacious! We had a view of the bright lights of the Las Vegas strip. It was lovely.

I also liked how the bathroom in our room has a small tv inside, so you can listen to music or watch tv shows while you shower.

They have a 60 second rule for the food\/drinks in the fridge and on the cart in the rooms. So see see, no touch! Unless you are thirsty\/hungry.

I recommend trying the Lobby Bar & Cafe conveniently located near the hotel elevators. It's a great place to grab a drink and small eats while you relax.

The club entrance on the main floor can get pretty packed at night, so it's difficult to make your way around the crowd when you're walking to the parking lot.

It's convenient how Wynn and Encore are connected, so you can walk back and forth between each place. There's plenty of restaurants and stores for you to check out while you venture between both places.

So Saturday morning we woke up and there was no hot water.  I had a meeting early and called the front desk to see what they could do to help.  I was told they were working on the problem and the whole building was without hot water. ""There are over 3,000 guests and no one has hot water"", they said.  When they were unable to offer a solution I suggested a call to the Spa so that they could arrange for me to run down for a quick shower.  The young woman who took my call said, ""why don't you call them and see if they can let you in?""  I suggested, their being a 5 star hotel that she be the one to call and make arrangements.  I was simply holding them to the standard they had set for themselves!  I believe that in a 5 star operation they should be the ones doing the thinking as well as figuring out the solutions.  I already had suggested they call the Spa at Wynn since their Spa was also without hot water!  
I had told the young lady to check on it and call me back.  She had the front desk manager call.  He said that they were going to give us two Spa passes for the Wynn Spa but he were only doing this because we asked and it was not something they normally do but since I requested it they were going to do it!  Well I had simply requested to use the shower and I don't think I needed to be reminded of their shortcomings.  They should have made a suggestion that I use the Spa shower and not make it look like I was some sort of pest!  So many of the employees there are so ill trained as to what 5 star service really is!
Furthermore, having sent my Yelp review to the Hotel Manager, and two Front Desk Supervisors (Evan and Joshua) I have yet to hear from any of them regarding the details of this horrendous experience at their so called 5 star hotel!

This is a masterpiece of a hotel! It simply does not get better than this for Prestige, entertainment, location, and overall splendor! The luxuries and amenities at this superlative property cannot be overstated. Let's just say that the service was impeccable, the surroundings completely luxurious, and the rooms were big yet cozy and designed with a wonderfully contemporary flair.

On another note, the encore Beach party was a party that felt like it was for the lifestyles of the rich and famous! The world famous Zed was actually the DJ!  If you like an extraordinary party, and swimming pools and alcohol, with hundreds of people, then this is your ticket! It was an absolute blast. There were plenty of places in the hotel that you could find that were quiet, and reserved, if that is your preference, but the beach party was for loud fun! 

To say I recommend this extraordinary hotel casino resort would be an understatement. If you have the means, give this hotel a stay, it is well worth it!  Bravo!",0,0,0

The decor beautiful, room nice and big with a even bigger beautiful luxurious bathroom. The beds feel like your sleeping on a cloud. And very convenient for those going to the club XS to see Diplo like we did. 
But there was a huge fault in this perfect stay. The room was paid for as a gift and all I had to do was put a $150 deposit which would be returned minus $28 for resort fees in 4 days sense I used my ATM. I only stayed for 1 night but they took for the first day $150 as expected then the next day $179 and then another charge for $270. For what reason I still have no clue sense the room had already been paid for. All of the charges got refunded one at a time after the 4 days but sense it was my ATM account it messed with all of my bills sense it was right at rent time. 
So sense they took that money out for no reason I did not have enough in my account at the time for a couple of bills to go threw and was charged late fees. Thanks ENCORE!!!
So be careful and make sure to check your charges for they might pull a fast one on you. It's not the first time either for something similar happen to a friend of mine. 
Don't think I will go back and stay there for the fear they will mess up my bank again.",1,0,0

There are also many business convention types here and a nice mix of different types of people. There are also normally a fair amount of kids\/families here. 

If you are familiar with the Palazzo rooms, these are very comparable in size. The rooms are bigger & Nicer than Aria's.

Like I said last time, the place is beautiful and a great hotel.  However, the rules have gotten worse.  I've been coming to The Encore for over 5 years now.  I never pack anything other than shorts and tank tops since Vegas is hot.  So, I'm wearing my Baron Davis Warriors jersey and the lady at the lounge says to me that she can't serve my girlfriend food with me standing next to her since tank tops on men are banned.  My girlfriend was wearing a tank top too and  her nipples were poking through the shirt pretty good.  I asked what's the difference if my shoulders were showing.  I said my girldfriends nipples are showing and that would normally be a problem in many bars\/restaurants.  She said men have to wear shirts with sleaves and women can wear anything they want.  Wow!  

Later at the European pool, my girlfriend was topless and in her thong\/g-string.  She wanted to buy me a beer at the bar by the topless pool.  We both walk up there and they say they can't sell her a beer because she is topless.  My girlfriend says it's a topless pool and you are the bar at the topless pool.  Why can't you sell me a beer?  Their response was we have rules.  Mind you, I was wearing my basketball jersey and at the topless pool they can serve me, but not a topless woman.  

The Encore makes no sense to me.  A great hotel that doesn't cater to its customers.  I will stay there again because it's nice and the best hotel on the strip.  However, I will never hangout there and spend money.  I would rather go to other hotels where things are more laid back.

My few complaints are the way I was treated when I went to a craps table here. I was sitting at a slot machine enjoying a beer when I heard a lot of cheering going on at a craps table so I decided to go check it out and maybe jump in the game.. When I go over there and start watching the pit boss asked this ""high roller"" I guess if he was going to Make a bet and the exact words that came from this guys mouth was ""yeah I will make my bet when you get this as*hole outta here"" (he was talking to me but I didn't even know at first) then the pit boss asks me to leave and says its a ""private"" game... 

1. There were no stantions blocking it off
2.No one said anything besides this douche who was dressed like a slob
3. All because you have money doesn't mean you talk to people like that especially a paying guest

The pit boss then Denies he called me a ""as*hole when everyone clearly heard him!

I'm basically told the guy (the shaggy dude) if he wanted to find out who a real ahole was we can go outside and he just stood there ...

That's my MAIN complaint.. They did nothing to fix the situation you don't let people be treated that way who are paying over 1000 dollars to stay there...


Overall the hotel charges WAY too much for EVERYTHING like come on 19.65 for two coronas at the bar? What are they smoking ... I refused to pay that..

The room itself was really nice .. 21st floor strip view.. Can't complain..

This hotel is really expensive though, my wife and I spent an average of 500 bucks a day just in this hotel. But you really do get what you pay for. They didn't take any shortcuts when they built this hotel, they spent a lot of money and it shows. Also the poker room is beautiful, the best I have ever seen, makes other nice poker rooms look like poker rooms at a bowling alley. Only complaint would be that it's so far from everything else. Bellagio and Aria, which are comparable in price and amenities are located in the middle of the strip.

First off, location. I'm a pretty young gun (for now, at least) so my friends and I like to go clubbing at night and the Wynn\/Encore has a lot of the major nightclubs\/dayclub like Intrigue, XS, Surrender, and Encore Beach Club. It's always a plus staying here so we don't have to taxi out to another hotel to see one of our favorite DJs and once the night is over being able to walk back up to our hotel room is a life saver. 

Secondly, decor and atmosphere. Whenever you stay here it's very contemporary and modern and the buffet (not a great buffet, but nicely decorated) is so colorful it looks like a movie. The main entrance has a colorful, beautiful almost little forest area that people love taking pictures in. It's iconic. 

Third, the staff. Everyone from the second you check in is amazing and friendly. Even the guys that check your cards on your way up to your room are sweet and will crack jokes! Never hesitant to ask for anything here because everyone is so sweet and attentive. 

Fourth, the room. Rooms are always clean and the housekeeping staff are amazing at their job. Truly attention to detail here and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. Lights and drapes open and close by the press of a button and air conditioning? A+

Was I wowed? Nope. Mind you, we were not guests at the Tower Suites, or their apartment\/villas.. I heard the experience there is like a whole different kind of property.

Yes, there are floor to ceiling windows. Yes, they are big. Yes, the general overall quality of the furnishings and upholstery, bed quality above average. But surprised there were....

SHARP (!!) TVs that are used to partition the sleeping from the lounge area (which was fine.. no wow factor)...no coffee anywhere in the room. What!!!! No coffee, just so you, Steve, can force us to give you even more of our $ and head to the 24 hour Cafe strategically positioned at the corner of the Wynn and Encore? So apparent, and soooo cheap of him.

A minor threat (things are spring loaded) in form of sign that if any item either atop the fridge or inside it is moved or displaced after a period of 60 seconds, patron will be charged a $25 restocking fee. 118F weather. Not able to even chill anything purchased. Just so foolish and ridiculous.

Chinese have a word called "" DAI FONG"". That means, more or less, big-hearted\/generous\/not displaying stinginess n penny-pinching. Mr. Wynn, for having blown $2 BILLION (not to mention the $60 million it took to make the Beach Club and pool materialize to stay competitive), is...

NOT THIS DESCRIPTOR! at least he's not showing it in the small stuff. I was very, very put off by this. 

Facial bar of soap doesn't even lather or possess any kind of emollience. Reminded me so much of those dermatological soaps\/fragrance free, etc... and did not speak ""luxury"" to me; rather, medicine soap! No thanks. Must say, tho,their BAMBU line of lemongrass citrus was off the hook... in the way of shower gel and shampoo, etc.  No daily paper to room. urgh.

The gym. let's not speak of the poor, shoddy ventilation, low ceilings, etc. Though those Cybex machines i enjoy so much are present, and there are chilled water bottles and towels (like other high end hotels.. i.e. Ritz, Aria), it appeared like another room of the spa\/salon area. Strange to work out in such a space. And again.. that
sucky ventilation. Overheard 2 other gentlemen complain about it audibly. 

The gym and spa bathroom are shared. As such, welcome to total luxuriance... a living room, large TV, sofas, faux fireplace, and tea and spa water, fruit found inside of the bathroom.. Yep! and staff linger there too. 

Pool... mostly adults were there. The pool shape and lack of en masse peeps was nice. relaxing to swim and sun... Drinks here were major weaksauce and were made poorly. Mojito and an Arnold Palmer. Ratios didn't balance on either drink. Dont' ask the prices. GULP.

Another separate European pool adjacent. These are completely separate entrances than the Beach Club, with all those famed lilypads and cabanas. 

PS most comical moment: watching Cantonese soap operas and serials (both olden style and contemporary) from the bathtub. I had to LOL on that one... such a total novelty and weird experience!!! There are about 6 channels all dedicated either in Canto or Mandarin. The vice of my people........ sigh",7,6,5

When I walked into our suite the first thing that came to mind was WOW!!! Our view was beautiful and everything about the room was beautiful, especially the bathroom. I really loved the glass shower and I loved how there were two sinks and a huge mirror, they even provided a light up vanity mirror. Another thing I loved about our room was that the curtains, privacy notification (aka the please do not disturb sign) and I believe the lights were all remote controlled! LOVE IT, because I'm too lazy to get up and do things when I'm on vacation! 

We called house keeping quite a few times, okay okay MANY TIMES and they were pretty slow with bringing things up, the only time they came up quickly was when we asked for a bunch of band-aids and security brought that up to us. But with my experience house keeping at most hotel aren't instantaneous because they have other guests they need to take care of as well.

On a lighter note, staying here was so convenient because you have XS and Surrender right downstairs and plenty of good restaurants to dine at, PERFECT. If you're heading downstairs be sure you have your room key with you because if you don't the security will not let you get to the elevators until they see your room key! Oh, and I believe when you check-in, you need to put down a $250 deposit. Which you will get back minus the hotel fees.

They chose to stay at the Encore Tower Suites as the venue of choice, and they were very summarily impressed from their point of arrival to the rest of their stay. I can't speak for their departure experience, as we had already left town before then.

We got an opportunity to tour out guests' suite, and I must say from the moment that we were greeted by the lady usher at the Tower Suites entrance, and all of our interaction with the staff, and the overall decor and amenities; I just can't help but be in awe of how well executed everything was.

The classic, yet ornate elegance, the courtesy and friendliness of the staff, and the view were just stupendous.

We no longer have any reason to stay at any hotel in Las Vegas as we have a beautiful and large home with many rooms. 

However, if we ever had a need to stay in any hotel - it would definitely be here!

There is definitely no doubt that this property's awards are well deserved.

I have so much good to say, that I could just continue on with all that we had experienced.

The only, and I must emphasize the word only, negative experience we had was with their Valet service. 

They have to anticipate busy weekends and should have enough Valet help to move the cars along. 

Furthermore, they should not direct Valet parked cars towards a lane that the taxis obviously consider as their thoroughfare. Our car nearly got clipped multiple times by irate taxi drivers that insisted that we were in the wrong even though we were simply following the Valet's traffic guidance and direction.

Aside from the horrendous experience, everything after that was definitely a wonderful and  memorable experience.

Just simply a fabulous hotel!",7,1,2

Our room was great and the staff were all so friendly and helpful, always greeting us in the hallways, making sure we had everything we needed, and telling us to enjoy! They were also great on bringing in extra towels if requested, etc. The beds were super comfortable and they remote controlled blinds was awesome! 

The dining options inside the Wynn and Encore are great I loved going to Society Cafe for breakfast and getting their blood orange mimosas. And the clubs are just right downstairs so no waiting in the cab lines and standing in the cold waiting to get into the club.

The casino areas were also beautiful, and while like most casinos smoking is allowed everywhere my only gripe is that there wasn't a non-smoking area like the other resorts so our clothes consistently smelled of cigarette smoke throughout our stay here.

The only improvement I can offer is the friendliness of the concierge staff, as they were very short and rude in assisting other guests and myself . As paying guests of the hotel it seemed odd to me that they couldn't help me reserve seats at the lounges in the Wynn\/Encore.

Everyone from the concierge to the doormen to the people at the check in\/out counter were very professional, courteous and pleasant. 

The place itself is HUGE...like, be prepared to do some serious walking....it has a big casino and restaurant, and it connects to the Wynn, which has its own separate huge casino and dining areas.

I was only there for a few days, for mainly business, so I didn't get to explore and enjoy all that the resort has to offer...but am strongly considering returning for a longer trip for leisure.

The only negative thing about the place was that smoking is allowed in all the restaurants and casinos. I know that's to be expected in a place like this, but for those of us who don't ascribe to cancer sticks, nor do we like being exposed to the fumes created by others who do ascribe to cancer sticks, it's a big turn off to be hit in the face with a cloud of smoke as soon as you walk into the lobby.

The hotel paid a lot of attention to detail and the view was awesome. We were on the 20th floor and could see the strip from our room. Also the location was next to a pretty good and price reasonable taco shop. The beach club was just downstairs and their spa was amazing. 

FYI Men and woman are separated at this spa and also looks like they are registered so Canadian health plans seems to cover this (at least mine did).

Their gym lacked a bit of free weights so there was an occasional wait but the cardio equip was well enough. There were free lockers, water and towel.

only problem was friday night \/ sat ... you could hear the music from the club in my room. I was able to sleep but my gf was unable to due to the noise. This was already warned to us at the check-in so we were already expecting it.

Also a little distant from the core of the strip but still at a decent location I think.",0,0,0

Located almost in the center of the Strip, this place is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. If you catch the deals on the right days, you will barely pay over $140 a night here and it's well worth it. The decor is just stunning in the lobby and in the rooms. The room is just jaw dropping as you enter and has a very warm modern look. The lights and drapes are all electronic with a push of a button, and the bed is REALLY comfortable. I want to buy the mattress!! There's a little living room with a small L shape couch and a table for workspace. The bedroom is divided with a small wall and a LCD TV sits there. You have spacious dressing drawers and the bathroom is very nice with an outside bathtub with a standing\/sit down shower WITH an almost rain forest type shower head! I saw ""like"" a rain forest type shower head :) Close enough. Everything is so spacious here, you and your lover will love it!

One tip is that you should get a map from the lobby so you know where everything is in the lobby. Many restaurants to choose from and it will help you know which way to exit to the closet bus stop if you're busing it down the strip. 

And btw: To the people lowering stars because they think the room is too small. Really? Who stays in the hotel room more than to just sleep anyways? VEGAS BABY - you should be at the night clubs and gambling the night away! . lol..

PROS::

1] Spacious enough! Do you expect to do a marathon around your room?
2] Remote control drapes and lights for the lazy
3] VERY VERY comfortable Bed
4] Decor has a very nice modern feel and appeal
5] Free WIFI.

CONS::

1] Hotel is huge, Get a map from the lobby :) Be smart",2,3,3

My friends and I just got back from Vegas for Labor Day Weekend. As soon as we got in (around 10pm) on a Thursday, we went straight to registration and Mitchell helped us out. He was an absolute doll! He helped us check in and provided us with OUTSTANDING customer service. Our check-in was a breeze. As soon as we stepped into our room we were in awe. It was all that we wanted and more! Bathroom was HUGE...enough mirrors in the place for all the girls to get ready. We loved how everything was remote controlled from the drapes to the lights. The bed was huge and so was the Sony t.v. It was LAVISH. We couldn't have asked for more. We went downstairs and enjoyed hummus and ba ba ganoush from their lobby bar. Kyle was our bartender and was very entertaining. He was another plus to our stay. We loved the pool! They have a d.j. and a nude pool in another area. We went to club XS on Friday night and it was off the hook! We LOVEEEEE that place. It wasn't my first time there so I already knew what I was getting into but after a night of drinking walking up to your hotel and passing out is the best! Seriously...you have to stay at Encore...it's worth every penny!  The ONLY bad thing I'd have to say about this hotel is that you aren't allowed to wear your bathing suit in the lobby area or throughout the hotel...one of our friends had to get escorted to the room! They are pretty strict about that and also about not wearing any shoes. Luckily I brought a pair of slippers in my clutch which I suggest EVERY girl to do so you aren't walking around barefoot on the nasty ground.",0,0,0

As I entered Encore, I was seeing LOTS of red, and definitely got the sense of an Asian theme.  But, when I looked up and saw the word ""Wynn"" pop up, I was shocked! What, there's another way to spell Nguyen? I gotta run and tell all my Asian friends in Little Saigon...

So, 3 stars? I'm not hating on Encore, but I'm not really digging it either.  This review is for it as a hotel & casino to stay ONLY, as opposed to a certain attraction (like Wazuzu, XS, Lobby Bar & Cafe, etc.). Specifically, my thoughts on the room (that's what we all go to Vegas for, right? To stay in a room for hours...sarcasm, yes).

Likes:
-the layout and size of the suite
-you can leave the TV facing the bed, or spin it around to face the lounging area where the couches and desk are
-the control panel near the bed that operates the shutters, drapes, etc.
-hearing Steve Nguyen's, I mean Wynn's, voice when turning on the TV

Dislikes:
-while the room was nice, and the art was intriguing, the overall appearance was not too extravagant or distinguishable.  I felt it lacked the ""it"" factor
-that shower head sure starts off awfully hard and on blast every time!
-after being in my room for about 5 minutes, I noticed an unpleasant smell.  It was like the bionic, the blow, the bad, the buddha, the homegrown, scooby doo, backyard boogie, or whatever you want to call it.  I wondered where it was coming from, walked towards the adjoining door, and yep, it was the smell of weed from my neighbors.

Nice to know that I was staying at a real classy joint.  Pun unintended, actually.",4,14,3

First time was seven years ago when Husband surprised me for my birthday with a few nights here.  The first room on that first stay had a soaking wet mattress, so we had to move, and our next room was just fine.  Beautiful!  But boy did I come down with a terrible virus and ended up sick in the suite for the duration of our stay. I will say I counted my blessings that if I had to be sick, at least it was somewhere really nice.

Fast forward to this October.  Had one night to kill, so I put on my bargain-hunting hat (yes deals can be had for this 5-star...seek and ye shall find!), and that's how we landed here again seven years later.  

This was our first time dealing with a car in Vegas, so do know there are two lots close by...one for the Wynn and one for the Encore.  We ended up at The Wynn one (oops), which meant we also found ourselves at the Wynn registration rather than the Encore.  Oops again!  No wonder it looked different than we remembered.  Luckily our check-in guy could not have been more friendly and helpful...didn't make us feel like the fools we were for checking in the wrong hotel.  Instead he gave us as high up as he could considering the deal we had gotten, and off we went through the Wynn to the Encore, lugging our luggage.  Our mistake, but it worked out just fine.

Likes:  Great security!  They check your room key every time at the elevators.  Room itself was the same suite elegance we had had seven years ago.  Showing slight signs of age, but still 5-star amenities. All the necessities supplied.  Bed was very comfortable.  Nice shower.  TV in the bathroom as well as the one that swivels between the bedroom and living room.  

Location is definitely North Strip...you get used to the long red carpet walkway through the casino and shops to get to the Venetian and beyond.  Restaurant choices are very expensive.  Casino is on the quiet side with high limits.  In other words, we went elsewhere to eat and play.

Dislikes:  Hate the resort fees that all the Vegas resorts charge.  Inevitable I know, but it makes a person feel ripped off.  All the hotels should up their rates, imho and do away with the stupid extra fees.  That being said, no one is hiding from it.  Go in knowing that fee is coming.

Speaking of fees...parking!  There were signs saying to pay inside before leaving the garage.  We did.  (I believe it was $15)...then lo and behold the lever was UP.  We didn't have to pay anything.  Wah...not fair!",4,1,2

Basically it's a boutique hotel section of the larger hotel. The Tower Suites have some of the nicest, cleanest, most tasteful rooms I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. And the entire experience is great and relaxing. I actually enjoyed checking in. The Tower Suites has its own private valet drive up entrance ""porte-cochère"". The valet were super nice and courteous. Since you have to pay for parking (a new thing for Vegas) at least this valet experience is five star. They couldn't be nicer and it's quiet as it's only for the Tower Suites. The check in is in a small and beautifully decorated lobby, done in a calming and relaxing shade of jade green, rather than the vibrant red that is present in the rest of the hotel. It really feels like a boutique hotel even though you are in the middle of this immense property. The private entrance opens right into the casino behind glass doors. The reception at check in was fast, personal and so nice. They offer to show you to your suite if you desire. The view from the Las Vegas strip side is amazing. Everything is controlled electronically, including the lighting and the dramatic curtains that open to your view of the city. The bathroom is marble and gorgeous. Super ""free"" bathroom amenities include nice brushed steel handled toothbrushes and razors. It's all really well done and the only problem is you may not want to leave the room and enjoy the Tower's private pools or the adult pool at the Encore. You also have access to the Wynn hotel pools. Really cannot fault much. There is a turn down service included in the evening with Belgian chocolates. Room service breakfast was not spectacular for the price but it was very good. There is a ""continental breakfast"" offer for the Tower Suites but you will still be paying more if you order anything other than the bread, jam and coffee. I had an excellent eggs benedict. It is beautifully presented and the rooms are spacious with a fantastic view to enjoy your breakfast. Everything is new and clean. Really gorgeous.

The rooms are really amazing. We didn't have any upgrade or anything and the standard room is still the equivalent to a presidential suite at many chain hotels. 

From the brilliant 65"" tv to the stunning view from the floor to ceiling windows to the automatic curtains and more, everything was great. 

I used the gym all 3 days. Huge facility with ample equipment even for the fitness enthusiast like myself. They provide complimentary fresh fruit which was really nice.

Red red. Nice casino floor layout. I especially like the west, east, north south bars.

 Check in was easy. I did notice at certain times of the day when the lobby was jammed with people all trying to check in at the same time. I also noticed during this time some upset clients. After observing, I saw that they were trying to upgrade their room or get better pricing. Visitors to Vegas have been trained to haggle. This just isn't the place to do it. 

The adult pool was nice. The service varied from day to day, one day there were many servers, and the next we had to self serve. It was obvious they were training and testing the services in this area.

The crowd waiting to enter encore at 8 PM for the grand unveiling was in a festive mood.

The mood began to dimish as 8:15, 8:30, 8:45, 9PM started to roll around and the line had moved a grand total of 45 feet.
The employees of the Wynn spent the entire day promoting the 8PM start and invitation to experience the new hotel an casino.

Opening the line a few ""guests"" at a time so as to not impeded on the ""total experience"" of the Encore for all the others.

Please - - - it is another huge addition to the Vegas strip and there was nothing magical to it..........
The hotel is pleasing, the casino is very similar (obviously) to the Wynn-although there is a touch more red in the decor and the experience should be wonderful once the staff is on the par with the Wynn.

I do not think, as a whole,  there is an entire staff that can match the quality of the people that work in the Wynn.

Only gripe was the long check in.  Encore could do something about how they check people in.  There were 4 people helping a line of 50+ people check in (our check took 45 minutes) and 7 people helping their elite customers (if you were elite, your check in was less than 5 minutes).  So being elite has it perks, especially in Vegas but I would have hoped they could have made the ratio of people checking guest in more proportional.  When I mentioned this to the front desk person, she upgraded us to a tower suite at no additional cost (a $60 value).  So the wait suddenly was a non issue.

Valet Parking - great.  Self parking very close so you can do either.  Slots paid out better than some other places I've been to on the strip.

Since then, I've tried other hotels and fell in love with Mandarin Oriental so I never felt the need to stay anywhere else. However, my girlfriends from MA were visiting Vegas and their timeshare was near the Wynn, so I took it as an opportunity for me to try out Encore.

I was not disappointed, in fact, I signed up for the Wynn's Insider club because I was impressed. However, it lost a star because of certain things that irked me, but don't get me wrong, this is worth 5 stars, to each their own, right?

Here are the pros of this place:
-beautiful place
-beautiful decor
-casino doesn't have loud, obnoxious people...all the time
-you can't smell smoke in the hallways and the shopping areas
-lots of shops, bars, restaurants to choose from
-connection to the Wynn for more dining options
-nightclubs and different pools to choose from
-room service is top notch and very fast
-great service
-bell guys are very friendly
-everything looks pristine
-personalized name on your room key
-check out was a breeze

CONS:
-to upgrade to a higher floor than the 30th floor, you'd pay $30 a night (this is important if you don't want to hear the noise from the nightclubs every night)
-WIFI is only allowed for 2 devices
-valet defeats the purpose when you still have to walk to the valet area and then have them pull your car out 10 feet
-the noise all hours of the night if you're not on a higher floor and even on the 50th floor, you can still hear it
-the walls are paper thin, I can hear my neighbor flush his toilet and brush his teeth while I'm trying to sleep
-the lobby bar wreaked of smoke, which means if you're staying there and walking by there to get to the elevators, you're inhaling a lot of smoke.
-far from the strip
-view from our windows were great on the left side where it shows a bit of the strip and their golf course, but on the right, it was just dirt. Not worth it to get a view of the strip, I should have gotten view of the golf course.

My problem is that the staff only comes in two varieties - extremely friendly and helpful or arrogant and rude. At this level, everyone should be happy clients are in their hotel. 

Many have talked about the resort fee - it sucks. You get nothing for $28 per each day of your stay. It is going to be a class action law suit someday soon. It is so obviously a gimmick. Everyone complained about this concept and penalty. 

For gamblers, I can warn you that each of the casino hosts gives you different info. One tells you that you need to earn 3000 points each day to get your room comped, while others tell you it is 5,000 points. The Caesar's Total Reward is much better for those who do heavy gambling. 

I won't be coming back to a Wynn property - I was there on opening week at Bellagio because I had so much confidence in Steve Wynn, but things have changed. Too bad for everyone. Lastly, I was comped for rooms, but was short changed on food and other charges based on how much I ran though the slots. Yes, if they had given me what I felt I deserved, I would have not left with such a poor taste in my mouth. The person who took care of my comps was the one who insisted that the comp rate was 5,000 points per day, instead of the 3,000 points like I was first quoted by another casino host - please get your stories together!",0,0,0

I went to Vegas but only once left the hotel (somehow I ended up on the strip outside the wynn after a night of hard partying...still no idea how that happened). Our daily routine was order lunch via room service at 3pm (waking time) then champagne, then champagne again then have the minibar restocked from the previous nights damage....and  proceed to clean it out again. Around 10-11ish we would leave the room to go to XS and around 4am we would hit the tables. Would have been nice to see more (any) of vegas but we had a great time...until we got the room bill. Our hotel room fee was $700 and room service was $800...we didnt feel so big anymore....we transformed from rock stars to nervous teens who had crashed the family car.
anyway if you choose to go down the same path we did - get the burger sliders (they are ground beef at its finest) with perfect onion strings, also every bottle of champagne was delish and im sure if you want to save some money (in retrospect, always a good idea) you probably wouldnt be able to differentiate the champagne from the sparkling wine. oh, and they have a room service ""happy hour"" with corona's $5 each and some of the food for $10 a plate which is not bad compared to the regular price, trust me...",2,2,1

I decided the jump into the pool for a swim, wait a minute I meant sit on the couch. Yes, the couch was wet as if it was a swimming pool.  I immediately call the front desk and they apologized and said that they just finished cleaning the room and the couch was dry and they didn't fully dry it yet.  The asked if I wanted to be moved to a different room.  Excuse me? If you knew this, then maybe you should've gave us another room to begin with?  

I informed them that we are all already settled in and I suggest that they just bring two couch cushions  from another room and simply swap it.  They said they couldn't do that.  They will send room service with towels to dry the couch.  15 mins later, room service came with towels and some crazy loud fan to dry to couch.  I expressed my disappointment.  The cleaning guy said he will try to get two couch cushions and swap it for us, sounds like an idea that I heard somewhere before.

first off, the bribe thing at reception worked. best $50 spent all trip. thanks buddy! started off w\/ a single, but was upgraded to 2 queen beds, 1 roll away, 1 fridge, and an awesome, and i mean, AWESOME view of the strip.  the room was absolutely amazing. we had a freakin doorbell, a door bell! the decor of the room was very nice as well. had some interesting art work.. but everything else was pimp. we went to the club at encore sat night, xs. lets just say, if you're a group of single guys (or girls), having a room right upstairs from the club is a big PLUS.

the last few times i've been to vegas i've stayed at the palazzo across the street.  tho they are comparable in opulence, i think encore is gonna b my new hotel 'spot' for the next few years.

btw, the hotels proximity to the mall & walgreens is a big plus.

all in all, an absolutely beautiful casino\/hotel. definitely recommend to anyone going to vegas. jus one thing tho, i wish they had thicker walls cause we had security come to room a couple times sat night around 4am because of noise complaints... i mean, we were just yellin ""woo boys!""... swearz :)",5,4,5

Sealed the deal with three girls in this room, they agreed the rooms here are mint.. My room was on the 59th floor with Panoramic Views of the Strip. Got a sick deal off Travelzoo.com, my best friends each were in the far more expensive tower suites.. One has more money than god(were talking dropping 5000 grand on slots\/losing 50k for the weekend), his room could sleep 8plus people but wasnt that much better than the 250(regularly 500plus) a night room I stayed in.One of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in, especially considering how cheap it was. Definitely reaping the benefits of this recession.

The decor of the room was top notchj, lots of marble\/granite, most of the colors in the suites were of red, white and black tones. All the Jacky chans seem to love the Wynn & Encore, they must dig the lucky red coloring..Huge but oddly situated plasma sat in the middle of the room that swiveled when you needed to watch it from either the bed or the couch. Bed was a dream, perfect to sleep on as well as pound some broads head into a pillow as you lay the root.

Some nice personal touches, include being able to hit one button and turning off the TV,all the lights,shades and other various things all at once as you fall asleep, truly came in handy after I pounded my cheeseburger from room service and was too drunk to stuble around the room to flick off switches. The Bathroom was bigger than most hotel rooms, it had a TV to watch as you disinfect and try to clean the bodily fluids off the animal prostitue you just slayed.. The tub was a monster and the steam shower was great. Also nice that the toilet is in its own separate room inside the bathroom, even had a phone conveniently located next to the toilet. Perfect for giving your mom a ring as you drop the Cosby Kids off at the pool. 

Room Service was sick here.. Amazing food.. Being a Native NYer I am impressed with just how good the chicken salad, wraps and desserts were.. Semi Pricey but fair in my opinion considering the quality, portion size and service that comes with it. Highly recommend ordering while staying at the hotel. Just about everything on the menu is good. WIll run you a solid 60 bucks for two people.

The pool at Encore isnt anything special, not much talent, lots of washed out cougars, old guys with gold watches & there bought Dime pieces.. Most of my friends went to the Wynn's pool instead and I personally just hit up Wet Republic each day...

The downsides to this hotel are its at the South End of the Strip, most cab rides run a minimum of 10-20 to get anywhere decent. Unlike the Hotel at Mandalay Bay there is no Starbucks in the lobby, no day time pool party and this place could almost be too luxorious\/pretentious for some hard partying animals like myself. No cheap food around either for when you just want to grab a quick sandwich or slice of pizza.. For that Id walk across the street to the mall to get your coffee or junkfood fix...

My complaints are small and this is one of the best places to stay in Vegas. For the hard partying types like myself its a toss up, definitely gentlemanly  and classy. Will be staying here again.",0,4,2

After years of enjoying the swankiness of Aria, I was ready for a new change of pace and Encore was everything I expected.

Rooms - 5 stars all the way. 
Spacious, lovely decor, great view of the Wynn and TI facing the strip southward, enormous bathroom, and state-of-the-art amenities all around.... all this for the basic run-of-the-mill suite. If you're traveling with others, I recommend asking for conjoining rooms to enhance the size. The beds feel as if you're sleeping in a cloud. Comfort and elegance are the forefront of their design here.

Casino\/Gaming - 4 stars 
Never crowded, always clean, attentive cocktail waitresses, friendly pit crew and a plethora of games including War. Heads up though, the bars with Video Poker do not comp, I found this out after already donating my $20.

Dining - 5 stars
We only actually ate at the Lobby Bar but were very pleased with the breakfast we ordered, attentiveness of the staff and cozy setting. Sinatra and Costa di Mare are both on my immediate hit list to try out next time.

Check-in\/Check-out\/Front Desk - 5 stars
Staff was great on all fronts. The check-in line was speedy and the front desk was great about resolving an issue I had with a dispute. I don't recommend trying a $20 or $50 sand which here as I've heard it's frowned upon. That said, being polite and asking about better options doesn't hurt. 

Bottom line: at this price, I'd stay here again in a heart beat over others. Only gripe to walk away with is that it's at the North end of the strip and a bit of a walk. That said, the Valet pool has a designated Uber\/Lyft pick-up which was less than $10 to get us near the Mlife side of the strip.",2,1,1

The day after we got married we took a quick escape to Vegas and was thrilled to stay at Encore.  We've stayed at Venetian and Palazzo which we still love but the rooms here just make you feel like a dirty ass PIMP!

This hotel just makes you feel sexy.  From the music pumped into the Casino to the red decor in the lobby.  The hallway decor leading up to your room are so chic I wouldn't mind it if I got locked out of the room and slept in the hallway.  It's that good.

These are the differing qualities of the rooms here that make Encore stand out:

1. Doorbell! 
2. Centralized lighting, do not disturb notification and roman curtain control at your fingertips (on the nightstand).
3. Very posh beds and decor.
4. ihome station for your ipod or iphone.

If I could make a few changes I would take the spaciousness and  the number of TVs (there were only 2 TVs - the bedroom unit swivels to the separate living area) of the Venetian\/Palazzo rooms.  

Oh, and if you are staying during the weekend and if you for some wacky reason would like to get some sleep be aware of which side and floor of the hotel you are staying....XS goes until 4:30 am.

Decided to give this hotel a chance. Im glad I did. I've always had the impression as Vegas being so crowded and just over populated. This hotel totally delivered and totally a game changer in every possible way.  From the decor, organizations,  cleanliness, pools, and most importantly staff and service. Encore definitely knows how to make their guest feel at home. We were greeted by this genuine and charismatic front desk Nina who made us feel comfortable right away. She was very helpful,knowledgeable and funny. She gave us the different ""expecations"" of room placement according to the floors. So no surprises with views etc. Which we really appreciate.  We got to our room and its exactly what she have mentioned.  Lets talk about the room. Clean, classic , and contemporary with touch of modern technology and edgy look. Spacious and everything you need is there.  Were here for birthday celebration and we got back to our room later that night with a little birthday gift box. Of course from our friend Nina from the front desk. 
Next up pool. Love love the pool as it has intimate and boutique feel unlike this crazy massive pool in other hotels and can be filled up with so much people. We got there Saturday early am to get good tanning bed spots. Later that day the term ""busy"" is not shoulder to shoulder annoying experience.  Definitely has quality control.  Certainly a plus. Lets talk about service : EVERY little detail that we needed, encore has it and any issues they have promptly responded in the right time. Even housekeeping are all friendly here which is foreign in this type of large hotels.  We got back to our room that night and the turned down service made you feel like you are at a resort.  The housekeeping did a good job and was very detailed cleaning the room.  We had to made sure to make a phone call to let them know how happy we are with the service and of course leave a tip.  Veronica B is the name of our housekeeper. :) Stayed in 19th floor.  Overall experience was well executed and Encore definitely changed my view and perception about Vegas. Also my first time, not leaving the hotel at all through out my stay. Thank you Encore for a great experience.  Please keep this up!!!!! Will definitely come back here. Recommend to my friends and family.   the only last thing is I wished I couldve gotten some benefits from the Red card. Didnt know the benefits only good during your current stay.

The decor is amazing and it's connected to the Wynn with the La Reve show that you just cannot pass up. Unfortunately, my 2 stars only count for those two things. 

The party that I was with booked our flights and hotel through Expedia for convenience and price. We specifically picked the 2 queen beds which was more expensive on our Expedia reservation. When we checked in, the hotel said they could only give us the 1 king bed room. They said that Expedia only sent them the 1 king bed reservation and not a 2 queen bed room. But they would be able to give us a 2 queen bed room for an extra $50 a night. Fine that's fair. But we showed them the itinerary because we have proof that we PAID for that size room. Most hotels would give it to you because you have proof of confirmation. The front desk receptionist then pointed out that it's subject to availability. Well duh! You have it available, but still want $50 dollars??? That's BS. We also talked to the manager and refused to do anything about it until we called Expedia. So we called and had them talk to the front desk, and then the mgr agreed to give us the room, still charge us the additional money, but told us to have expedia call their accounting dept. It really wasn't that simple. 3 phone calls later and still nothing. Hoping they keep their word and will give us the credit back. When we checked out, I noticed there were many other ppl with very unhappy faces and a mile of complaints. I know ppl love to complain, but damn, that many ppl??

Other than that, the room had a wonderful view, bed and pillows were comfy, big bathroom (only housekeeping wouldn't refill shampoo and conditioner unless we asked), pool was great (there's a European pool too i.e. topless), XS nightclub (must check it out, expect a long line unless you know someone at the door).

You better be ready to spend a pretty penny because everything is expensive here. The Wynn and Encore are linked together, but the Encore is more updated. The casino is beautiful, the architecture, the accessories. The pool has a French Riviera feel. There is a family type pool at the Wynn but the Encore is more for adults. They also have a European pool that is 21 and up that is topless. Concierge was very accommodating and made you feel like you were VIP! Love that. The people are hip and it was very exciting. The Beach Club pool party is off the hook on Sunday as well as Club XS being the hottest club in Vegas. Great hip loungy house music throughout the hotel. I loved it!

Our king suite was off the hook. Living room with separate sleeping area (360 degree swivel flat screen). Executive desk and chair area.

Quick adds: to check in there are several lines so don't get stuck on the first long line that everyone is on. 

2- be careful at the mini bar, you will be charged if the items is not placed back right away and the same way it came out

3- to check out you can have them email you a summary of room so you don't have to wait in line to check out. 

4- bath water runs blue so don't be afraid

5- bring slippers, the marble gets slippery when wet

6- room has Ihome so you can bring your Ipod

One morning when I got up in the morning early for a quiet breakfast before a meeting i encountered a person being mirandized by the police in the lobby bar.  At breakfast i was the only one who had been to bed as far as i could tell. 

 Another time a group of people doing shots of vodka in one of the main restaurants distrubing nearly everyone around them.   Maybe this is Vegas.  Also there was no place to have a quiet decent drink; the piano bar opened way too late and the smoke at one point slipped into my room (I believe people were smoking on my non-smoking floor).

Finally the checkin was a mess; i don't expect to wait 45 mins in a top flight hotel to check in. The excuse I got was 'they have 2000 rooms and everyone comes at the same time'.  I said if it is that predictable then they need to redesign the whole process.",0,2,0

We arrived late Friday night probably around 10pm and we took advantage of valet parking. I've been inside Encore quite a few times between XS and Encore beach club. Anyway check in was a breeze! I've stayed at other hotels on the strip and waited up to an hour to check in because the line was so long. 

At check in they provided us with tons of options for rooms to upgrade to. We decided to stick with what we booked just two rooms next to each other since there was four of us. Great thing about Encore is that all the rooms are suites. The rooms were well kept and spacious. The beds are even more comfortable. 

Also the bathrooms were great double sinks which is always a good thing for us girls. The tub separate from the shower and deep which is perfect after a long night out. I must say it was definitely enjoyable. 

Not to mention you can pretty much control the room from the comfort of the bed. Whether you want to control the temperature or turn the lights off you can do so. I really like the fact that the control panels allow you to charge your phone so it's not in outlet clear across the other side of the room.

So why not a 5? or the 2 I was planning on giving the hotel after my stay?

I booked the hotel through Travelocity - it was a very nice room at $1,300 a night and it was to include WiFi and Breakfast.  

Upon check in I was told that I could have a $30 voucher towards in-room dining breakfast. Having stayed at the Wynn many times, and in Las Vegas at comparable hotels about 100 times over the years, and not being born yesterday, I know for a fact that a pot of coffee in in-room dining is close to $10, oatmeal runs at about $30. Toast and eggs are at least $25 for one person. Plus gratuity, delivery fee, tax, etc. So I told them that breakfast was included for two in the booking not discounted. Jee, who was checking me in, argued that I could order breakfast up to $30 for two people, and spoke to me like I was a gullible fool. So I asked for the manager. After speaking to the manager Jo, they did me a massive favor and gave me a $60 discount towards my ""included"" breakfast. Breakfast consisted of oatmeal, toast, a croissant and coffee and came to over $100 each of the 3 days of our stay. I was also told my ""free"" WiFi that was also part of our booking rate would be charged if we logged in on more than 2 devices. It's 2016. Some of us EACH have a phone and a laptop or iPad that need WiFi, so 2 devices per room is a joke. 

One evening I was about to enter the Tower from the casino, and my daughter distracted me with a quick question. We were close to the entrance but not blocking the entrance. After 30 seconds, a security guard literally shooed me away telling me I can't stand so close to the Tower entrance.

The air quality was not good. The room smells of smoke that comes through the vents.

I completed a survey at the end of my stay and the reason my review is a 3 and not a 2 is because I was contacted immediately and they refunded the money they had charged for the breakfast after I explained that, at ~$1,300 a night, it is not the $30 that I cared about. It is the principal - that an establishment like the Wynn\/ Encore would try and nickle and dime me like that - as if they are desperate for the extra $30, that they included as part of the package and then wanted to go back on their agreement.

In my opinion, I should not have been placed in a position to have to fight for what was agreed upon in the reservation in the first place.",8,3,3

The lobby bar is my favorite place to hang, the bartenders are so cool, the servers are fast and efficient. 

The shopping is beautiful (way $$$, but window shopping is nice), and the restaurant choices are amazing).

Encore is definitely better than Venetian and Wynn. (Tied w\/ Palazzo)

I have stayed at Encore at least 5-6x now and I would probably never pay more than $300 a night here. The hotel may impress some for the first time, but it's getting a little too old for me. I actually like the new rooms at Aria more, but checking in at Aria was absolutely horrible. If you do not mind staying off the strip, I would highly recommend staying at the M Resort. The hotel rooms are new and have more of a modern appeal over Encore. The only thing I don't like about the M Resort was the fact that they are priced around $175-200 for Fridays\/Saturdays (Californians get 30% off). That's pretty much the same as staying on a cheaper property like Paris on the strip. If you don't mind the drive to the strip daily, I would recommend staying at the M. The average rate for a King bed at Encore on Fridays\/Saturdays is around $300-$350.

Overall Encore is great for:
+Groups (People who stuff 8 people in 1 room - you know who you are)
+XS \/ Surrender - The option of just going back to your hotel room after a night out.
+Shopping - The mall is across the street.

If Palazzo was cheaper than Encore by $50 a night, I would rather stay there. However, I believe there are resort fees($10-15) at Venetian \/ Palazzo properties and there are no resort fees at Encore\/Wynn.",4,2,2

Generally, the property is great--the rooms are spacious and well decorated, the Swivel TV\/bathroom TV were great and the food at their ""Society"" restaurant was delicious. BUT... the Steve Wynn lost my love when he decided to cheap out on the details.

If the Wynn\/Encore Hotels are competing with high-end 4\/5 star properties then they should actually COMPETE. Luxury shouldn't be extra. Want to use the gym? $30 (if not included in your package). Want to not sleep right above the thumping hotel nightclubs? You'll need to pay extra upon check-in to get a ""view""(50th floor and above). Want turn down service or just fresh towels in the evening? Only upon request. --Heck, you want them to CHANGE YOUR SHEETS--EVER??- you'll  need to call housekeeping and request that they do so. Every time. Otherwise, they will keep making your bed with the same dirty sheets for the duration of your stay. There was no in-room ""keep it green option"" that allowed guests to make the choice. Ummm.. if I wanted my sheets changed only once a week, I would just stay home.

As mentioned, the space is really nice and the non-kid friendly atmosphere helps, but in the end, all of the nickeling and diming just left a bad taste in my mouth. Warning guests about fees at every turn for services that are included at hotels CLOSER TO THE STRIP seems like bad business. After the first day, I was afraid to wander around or to ask for an extra towel because I didn't want to get charged a mysterious fee.

I'm planning on returning to Vegas in a few months on business and I'm advising my company to book the team elsewhere. No more Wynn\/Encore for me.",0,0,0

A big group of us stayed in the Resort Queen Suite. Soooo spacious, so much more spacious than the Resort King Suite I hear. 2 queen beds, a roomy L-shaped sofa, floor to ceiling windows with drapes you control from your bed. So baller. I would also recommend prompt check in at the designated check in time, 3pm, to snag a room that's high up facing the strip. You can only do this at check in time. The chic but not pretentious decor was a great backdrop to our fabulous weekend. It's decorated like a stylish, boutique hotel but on a grand scale--it's Vegas afterall. The hotel is friggin' beautiful. 

What I loved most about this hotel was the attentive and uber friendly staff. A tray of yummy chocolates with a birthday card 'from The Encore front desk' was delivered to our room. Almost everything is personalized. When you turn on the TV, a greeting with your name appears. Your name's also on each room card. It's the little things that make you feel special.

The staff is always polite and courteous and if you have a special request or find something is not to your satisfaction, they will make every effort to meet your needs.  The only drawback is that it is not centrally located on the strip.  If you have plans at other properties for shows, you might walk a little further or spend an extra couple bucks on cabs but you will be excited to return here afterwards.  The entertainment and food options are top notch, so don't hesitate to make all reservations either here or the Wynn.  You'll be glad you did, because this is the most beautiful and will kept hotel on the strip.",0,0,0

We upgraded our room to a panoramic view when we checked in for an extra charge.  The view during the day was nothing to rave about but it's a different story in the evening, which the night view was magnificent.  There's a divider in the room between the bed and the living room.  The décor is beautiful.  Awesome!  There's a control panel next to the bed to operate the window curtains.  There is a refrigerator in the room but it was full of snacks to purchase.  It would've been great if there was a refrigerator for us to use in the room instead.   The bathroom is very nice.  

We ate at the buffet during lunch at the Wynn and the food was not that great, the service was terrible and I did not like the dining area where we dined at.  Don't know if we should go back to the buffet again on our next trip to Vegas.  

I actually want to give a rating of ""excellent"" for the Encore resort room because of the comfort, cleanliness and the beautiful décor, but my rating is four stars because we cannot use the refrigerator, the agent who checked us into the resort was not friendly and helpful, and the buffet at the Wynn was disappointing. 

Overall, we would love to stay at the Encore again.",0,0,0

My friends and I decided to choose to see RL Grime on the night of Friday the 28th of October for my 21st birthday.  We strategically planned to drive 5 hours after work to get there from Southern California, and knew that we would get in right away because we were on the guest list.  We were all extremely excited because this would be our first time going together and had heard so many great things about Surrender.
 
As we were standing in line, William (the bouncer), checked us one by one.  They got to my last friend, who clearly looked older than her driver's license and stopped her.  They asked her to open her phone up and go into her iCloud.  Her Russian name, Sasha, appeared on her iCloud, and from that they deduced that she was not the person on her ID (Alexandra).  Immediately they confiscated her REAL ID and stated that she had been using someone else's ID.  We tried to explain that her name on her iCloud is the Russian version of her American name, (Alexandra).  The bouncer William would not hear us out and stated that her hair was brown in the picture but blonde in person.  Also he stated that she was much skinnier than in the picture. 

Her ID was her own, valid, and not underage.  For about 20 minutes, we were arguing with the bouncer in order for him to give her real driver's license back because she needed to drive back the next day.  Once he realized he was clearly wrong, he handed it back to her.  He marked an X on her hand and said she still was not allowed in, reluctant to physically say he had been wrong.  I spent the rest of my 21st birthday equally as upset as her sitting in our hotel room, because by the time this whole ordeal was over, it was around 3 o'clock A.M.

Thank you, William, for ruining my 21st birthday by denying my best friend's real ID at the door, after we had been sitting in the car for 5 hours.  Thank you Encore for hiring a clearly unqualified man to be your bouncer.  PLEASE, please, please, I urge you all to go to a different nightclub and just hotel in general because of the sheer discrimination we faced.  I know Surrender is normally a great club, but if you have a chance of this every happening to you on you 21st birthday, just know that it is not worth it.",3,0,1

This property is still the equal of the Four Seasons\/Ritz Carlton crowd, and of course you'll pay for it. A sausage and eggs breakfast in room will cost you $32 for the entree alone so a big breakfast for two will be $100. But when you consider that it arrives fresh and hot on fine linen with quality flatware, you see where the money goes.There are no little plastic packets of Heinz ketchup; its glass and china all the way.

Not quite as picky on the little touches as they were in the day Steve Wynn was more involved in the day-to-day operation (some lights were out in the suite), but problems were fixed quickly and correctly.

This is a great choice if you like elegance and things done right. The poker room is very nice; not the size of some more involved in the poker scene, but still a great place to play.

- Jay Z

I found myself wanting more of the Encore because it is a very nice and cozy hotel. We walked into a room with a fabulous view of the strip with its sister hotel the Wynn across the way shining bright like diamonds. 

The room was spacious and clean. I always wanted a room with remote control blinds and finally got it here. The bathroom was perfect for taking care of the three S and for make up for the women folk. A safe in the closet kept my goods mine. 

The room service and concierge was on point. The housekeeping was standard. Nice flat screen tv, but it was annoying how Steve Wynn kept poppin up talking on the promo station that automatically pops up of the tv remotes is as much as looked at. 

The lobby and actual casino piece is not as good. The cocktail waitress are not as friendly as some others and the floor restrooms ate not as clean as some of the other luxury hotels. However, I am comparing them to luxury so that means its still better than most hotels.",2,1,0

We have stayed at many of the resorts in Vegas like wynn,  Venetian, MGM, cosmo and the encore is just prefect did us. We love how relaxing and clean everywhere is at the encore. Service is consistently great everywhere. The rooms are large and they have great rates at times and don't make you always pay the resort fee if you don't want to use this like the gym. This saves a great deal of money. It is easy to get to and is on the strip. The pools are nice and summer at very air and relaxing.",0,0,1

The room was almost as nice as the Cosmopolitan and a little nicer than PH Westgate.  We did have several issues we didn't like at Encore though.  At check in at the Encore desk they told us our reservation was for the Wynn and if we wanted to stay at Encore we would have to pay $25 more.  We showed them the Agoda email confirmation and they quickly said we wouldn't have to pay the extra money to stay at Encore since we could show them our receipt.  Not a huge deal for us but it seemed a bit odd that the check in rep didn't apologize or even think it was odd that our reservation was messed up.  We sort of suspected that they were just overbooked at Encore.  

Now for the nickel and diming.  We knew this going into it but the $25 mandatory resort fee is very annoying.   To me these resort fees are just a way of lying about the actual cost of the room.  Mandatory fees should just be considered part of the room's rate.  You get nothing for it other than WifI access.  They say you can use the wifi and it will show up on your bill then you will get a credit for it.  Seriously why bother to charge you if it's mandatory that you buy the Wifi anyways?  There is a sign on the fridge in the room that you can't use it for your own things or you will be charged $25.   

My last comment is that we couldn't find any reasonably priced place to get a small breakfast or lunch in the hotel.  We had to walk down to the Venetian if we wanted to eat.  I'm fine paying a lot being on the strip but their prices were a bit obscene.  Since this is suppose to be a 5 star hotel though, my last point about the food costs isn't that important.",0,0,0

The curtains are coming off the track. When I went to complain to the lobby they accused me of lying. I have never experienced such disrespect from such an establishment. I will NEVER come back here again. This place is a dump. There are definitely better places to stay here. Take your money else where.

Rooms are CLEAN, MODERN, and decently sized (745 sq feet--especially since they are all mini suites)! The only complaint I have is that it is at the END of the strip so walking can be somewhat of a hassle---especially during those awful summer months! Luckily, it is connected to its sister hotel, the Wynn, which further connects to the Palazzo\/Venetian, cutting down time spent in the heat. 

The main attractions at this hotel include the infamous XS nightclub (open Friday and Saturday 10:30PM-4AM and Sunday\/Monday 11:00PM-4:00AM) which hosts famous DJs like Kaskade, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Tiesto, and Afrojack. They also house one of the most popular day clubs, Encore Beach Club (offering night swim events every Thursday from 10:00PM-4:00AM and regular day club hours Fridays 11:00AM-7:00PM, Saturdays 10:00AM-7:00PM, and Sundays 11:00AM-7:00PM), with various DJs ranging from Kaskade, Zedd, and Skrillex to Lil John, Jermaine Dupri, and Flosstradamus. Be sure to check for offers\/discounted tickets if you stay at either Encore or the Wynn.

As far as amenities go, Encore offers patrons a fully equipped gym open from 6:00AM-8:00PM, spa, golf course, regular pool, and upscale shopping (i.e. Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Rolex, etc.) and dining options (there are ZERO cheap restaurants inside this hotel so you'll have to venture to either the Fashion Mall, located across the street, or towards the middle of the strip where there are a few fast food restaurants and drugstores). I've tried the Wynn Buffet and wasn't too impressed with their overall food quality so I recommend migrating to other hotels and checking out what they have to offer. The suite itself includes a couch, huge bathroom with a separate tub, his and her sinks, a 13"" TV built inside the bathroom mirror, touch screen capabilities to control almost everything within the room (i.e. blinds, TV,  and  room lighting), and your choice of one king or two queen sized beds. 

Room service is top notch as well as workers are more than happy to accommodate your every need. Late check-outs are available (at the discretion of the front desk staff) and checking out can be easily accomplished through their TV. 

Although this hotel is a bit more costly than some of the others on the strip---it is well worth it! Views from the rooms are usually quite pleasing to the eyes and I always feel safe as security guards check for room keys before allowing people to access the elevators. If you can find a good deal online I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try!",6,1,4

2. The line at check in and check out is ling. You will most likely need to checkout in line rather than electronically because there will most likely be errors in your bill.
3. The sell you a resort fee that includes $19.95 Internet and tell you the Internet is free. They then charge you for every device you log on to wifi. This $19.95 per device in addition to the resort fee.
3. Watch the charges to the room. They double dipped my AMEX charge at the cafe with a room charge.
4. There is a guard at the elevator who makes everyone show their key all day. They really should have the elevator work by using your room key like most hotels do.
5. Even with a reservation, the wait for the Jardin restaurant is 20 minutes.
6. Overall, not a high end experience that a Marriott platinum member would expect. I'm staying at Marriott and Starwood resorts in Vegas in the future. This property is definitely a no go!",0,0,0

Checking in was quick, we got upgraded to the 56th flr, but we didnt have the strip view. Our friends who were on the 37th did and a nice view of the wynn logo. Both rooms were king sizes since they ran out of doubles, but there were more than enough room with an L-shaped couch and a roll away. Mirrors everywhere! i especially love the mirror by the bed that was floor to ceiling. being the blind bat that i am, i need to be a good 3"" away from the mirror to fix myself up and being able to sit on the flr made my 1-2 hr make up routine so much easier.

the room also came equiped with an ipod dock which we blasted california girls and freak nonstop.

the layout of the room was pretty well thought out--space for our luggage but it did not interfere with our walking paths. enough room for propped-timer-pics and more than enough room to fit two room of girls for some pregaming fun.

service was great--thanks joseph for working through our mess and organizing our shoes. he even left a note for us :) although we were lucky with our housekeepers, we couldnt say the same for the other room. two of the girls had their bills stolen.

HIDE YOUR MONEY.

also, concierge doesnt seem to understand their role as helping their guests. instead they directed us in a maze to the business center to drop off a package to mail. most other hotels took the package and mailed it for us.

the greatest thing about staying in encore is that we rarely had to leave the hotel. we went to XS both nights and the only time we chose to leave the hotel was for wet republic, dinner at palazzo, and haze (because we were told the lakers were going to be there). your feet hurts? let's run upstairs and change!

overall, great stay at encore. i would definitely try to stay here again, especially with XS downstairs.",3,3,3

First reservations were messed up so it took about 45 minutes to check in then once we were checked in and got to our room our keys didn't  work. Though security responded fairly quickly it took at least 30 minutes to receive new keys. Also we were told we could get complimentary tickets to their night clubs at the concierge.....not true. The only tickets they would comp was to their ""boutique club"".  I was informed that they no longer give out tickets to the other clubs. Funny, when talking to security for club Surrender, they sounded shocked that they weren't giving out tickets. Also funny is that every other hotel on the strip were giving vouchers for free drinks and complimentary passes to their clubs, why not Encore? Also found out that there is a $20 resort fee which you don't even have time to take advantage of that many of the other hotels don't charge. Also very surprised that they don't have hairdryers or coffee makers in the room. Weird considering you're in a suite. Also I found that they had no restaurants that were of any quality. I ate at a few of them and food was gross especially at Stratta (this is technically at Wynn but bad is bad no matter what hotel it is). We paid $17.50 for a spicy pepperoni pizza with tomato basil sauce and cheese however it was more like eating greasy paper with pepperoni. We were wondering where the sauce and cheese were? I could've had better pizza at Domino's. Also drinks were gross my sister couldn't even finish her drink, she took two sips and couldn't take another. When asking our server if she could take the drink off the bill it seemed to be a big problem. Prices aren't cheap and if she can see that the drink hasn't been touched, then what's the problem?

We wanted to stay in a clean, ""higher end"" hotel and this place delivered. The entire property is beautiful. The rooms are very nice and recently updated (even though the place is still very new). The pool area is very nice and overall, the service is very solid.

We stayed in the regular suites (not the tower suite) portion of the hotel. I liked the fact that all the rooms are the same size and layout. The rooms are good size with floor to ceiling windows which offer nice views. The rooms have a modern design. They have very high ceilings and well placed mirrors to give the feel of more space. The bathrooms are beautiful with a large glass shower and separate, large tub. Lots of marble tile. Bed and linens were of very high quality and the electronic lighting control is slick. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Every staff member I made eye contact with greeted me warmly except for what was noted below.

We wanted to see ""O"" at the Bellagio. I called the concierge desk a couple of weeks before my arrival and Brendon scored us some excellent seats at the base price which was very cool. During our stay, he got us some great reservations at Le Cirque on a very busy night.  Every time I called, he remembered me and got things lined out for us very quickly. I am sure the other concierge staff is as good but you cant go wrong asking him for assistance. There was a huge convention (140k people) while we were there and we were very appreciative that we could get such great service.

Ok.. so why just 4 stars rather than 5? For me, a hotel or restaurant will need to hit a home run for me to give them a 5. Encore did well but they did stumble a couple of times.

Upon arrival, our check in experience was cold. Fast, efficient, but cold.  We knew about the resort fee prior to our arrival (it wasn't included in our package). We were told coldly it was mandatory, however it was either removed from our account later or was never added. We had a conflict with the staff when we wanted to go work out one morning which was uncomfortable. Who wants to argue with a gym attendant at 8 am over a $15 user fee? When it was corrected, it was added back and forward on our account for a mystery amount that needed to be corrected at check out.

We also rented a fridge and had it removed the next day. We were charged for 4 nights use. Again, it was corrected upon check out but I felt like I had to explain all the corrections and it literally took 20 mins to get us out of the hotel. 

Finally, I know this is vegas and I stay in a lot of urban hotels for business so I am a little more used to all the little fees hotels charge you but this property takes it to the extreme. These fees, to me, is more of an annoyance than anything. I am not an expert on hotel pricing but I would rather pay a little more and not have to deal with silly charges. We were charged the following during our stay:

Room at a higher floor - $20 per night. When that room had a funny smell, I took it as an opportunity to change to a room facing the other direction (toward the strip). That upgrade fee kept me at a high floor but added $5 per night to the fee for a total of $25 per night. Really?

In room Fridge - $25 per day

In room internet - $18 per day (unless you get the resort fee). The internet did not work at the pool or gaming areas.

Receiving a package while at the hotel - $15. Yes, just to receive a package plus we had to ask to have it delivered to the room and tipped accordingly (not knowing about the fee).

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the property. It met our needs. Yes it is more expensive than many but depending on your definition of value, this could meet your needs. It did ours.",2,1,0

Everything was sitting on little alarm pads just waiting for someone to make a mistake and look at the stuff for longer than 60 seconds.  I was so put off by the snacks (and a hangover kit too) that I didn't even open the mini bar.  Dang!",0,0,0

I stayed in September of 2013 in the Encore Tower Suites. Everyday, my room was made up multiple times, my room was spotless, and my toiletries were organized. My dirty cloths were even folded.  I cannot believe the care the housekeeping crew took.  Daily, breakfast was delivered to the room. It was great food and presented so nicely on amazing dinnerware and a white table cloth. The servers were excellent and insisted one morning that I don't even get out of the bed to let them in.

My boyfriend and I decided to come here during Spring Break, to celebrate my birthday.  Flight & Hotel ~ $260+ per person for 4 nights and 3 days [with $75 resort credit - we later used this to eat at the Wynn Buffet].  This was an offer too good to refuse [seriously!].

We checked in on a Tuesday, for some reason - checking in took awhile [probably because there were some problematic customer].  The receptionist was nice and asked us how many room keys we need, we asked for 2...turns out they automatically PRINT YOUR NAME ON THE ROOM KEY (which also works as your player's card).  SO AWESOME.  We weren't able to immediately check in because the rooms were not ready...until 1 hour later (when they courteously called us to let us know our room was ready).

We finally checked in our room, IT WAS SO SPACIOUS and NICE.  The layout of the bathrooms are very similar to the ones at the Venetian\/Palazzo [probably because they were designed by the same people].  The hall way was lined with mirrors on one side and a large closet on the other (with ironing board, extra pillow, blankets).  The wall of the bedroom portion was also lined with mirrors on one side and a cabinet w\/ refrigerator and snack box (great variety - even though we didn't use it)!  The living room area is partitioned by a wall and a television (that swivels, so when you're in bed you can have it face you or when you're in the living room, you can still enjoy the tv by turning it the other way).  Oh, also really cool was that when you turned on the tv, the main menu would greet the guest by saying, ""Welcome Mr\/Mrs. Last Name"" and given a variety of options to choose from.  The telephone was similar because it greeted the guest and gave a list of options.  I decided to call concirege and was greeted in a similar manner, ""Welcome (Last Name) Party, how can I assist you?""  WOW - tailored to the finest detail, talk about CUSTOMER SERVICE! There is also this master remote control by the bed that turned on&off all our lights and opened\/closed all our curtains [our bellhop taught us how to use it and it was came in really handy].

We had an awesome view of the strip, the pool, and XS.  The only negative opinion I had about Encore was that it was far from everything else - we either needed to 1)walk through Wynn to get to our destination\/the strip or 2)take a taxi everywhere...THIS WAS A LOT OF WALKING [even with comfy shoes] cuz Encore is basically the last hotel on the main strip (not including Trump or Circus Circus), it was pretty darn far...

*What would have topped off the awesome experience would be to have our bags dropped off in our rooms before checking in (especially if they're not ready).  To ensure that the bellhop who helped us got tipped, he could leave his business card or something.",2,0,0

Service is not bad but was much better when they first opened. On top of all this we had made a reservation weeks ago for bottle service at the Tryst $550 and we notified the rep with enough lead time that we changed our mind and were going to rent a Cabana at Surrender $750 instead, upon check out lo and behold that rep tried to sneak in $120 bill for the Tryst and we hadn't set foot in the place!

We spoke to the same front desk manager the next day checking out and she said she would look into it with a very bored expression, it seems like it's regular practice sneaking in charges hoping that clients do not notice.

XS is the most stunning place EVER.  I am a huge fan of Tryst and the service they provide there.  

Tryst had two problems:
1.not enough bathrooms
2.not enough stripper poles

Although the Encore\/Wynn looks like a five-star hotel, appearances can be deceiving.  We were excited to stay at the Encore and arrived on Christmas Day to celebrate the holidays and our baby's first Christmas.  Before arriving, we had called to confirm that there would be a crib in one of the two rooms that we booked as well as a mini-fridge to store the baby's milk.  The front desk at the Encore said that both a crib and fridge would be available.

Fast forward to the check-in process, which was neither fast nor efficient.  After standing in line for 30+ minutes on Christmas Day late evening, we were finally greeted by the front desk, which informed us that they had run out of cribs and fridges.  They said that we were out-of-luck and that many other guests were also out-of-luck--as if that was supposed to be satisfactory.  They wouldn't even guarantee that we would have a crib or mini fridge for our subsequent nights.  We explained that we specifically called earlier that day and the front desk reconfirmed that they had both.  As a ""consolation,"" the Encore stated that they would ""allow"" us to put the milk into the minibar without being charged for using it.

Despite our baby's cries in front of the check-in line, the manager Sam came out and restated that there's nothing he could do.  We explained that a similar situation had occurred to us recently at a Hyatt resort and the manager there actually sent staff to buy pack-and-plays for guests.  Sam stated condescendingly, ""Wow.  Well, I'm not going to go out and buy any cribs tonight.""  We, of course, acknowledged that this would be difficult on Christmas Day, but he didn't even offer a simple apology.  Sam then said that he would send up a rollaway bed, to which we replied that this was a seriously unsafe situation--a baby can't sleep in a cot, obviously.  Sam said that if we checked the Encore website, we would have learned that a guest's requests are merely preferences and not guarantees.  We pointed out that wasn't the issue because we had specifically called in advance and were not advised of the apparently high likelihood (as described by the Encore front desk) that cribs and mini fridges would run out.  We relied on the Encore's repeated promises over the phone, which one would expect a purportedly ""five-star"" hotel to keep, to our detriment.  We stated that had the Encore simply been honest with the fact that they don't have many cribs\/fridges and that they often run out, then we could have Primed one to the hotel or checked one in our luggage.  We even canceled a reservation at another hotel specifically because they didn't have cribs.

Sam was completely unsympathetic to our situation, but even worse than that, he was not at all innovative in trying to solve a guest's problems.  He could have tried to borrow a crib from another hotel or of course buy pack-and-plays (they're less than $50 at Walmart) as the Hyatt did.  Basically, he didn't even try.  A ""five-star"" hotel cannot fail to try.  Thanks to the Encore, our baby had a fitful night's ""rest"" and a terrible end to an otherwise wonderful Christmas day!

To all other families with small children, Encore\/Wynn does not want your business nor do they even want you on their premises.  Defeated as we were by the check-in process, we were stopped by one of the security guards.  Apparently, strollers are not allowed in the building and there is a sign in the entrance stating so.",6,2,2

Great water pressure in the showers, comfy beds (from what little I slept) and nice views of the strip or golf course.  I recommend getting higher floors to escape the pulsating beats of the clubs below.  

The reason for only 4 stars is the lacking customer service.  I don't know about you, but when I go places I expect killer customer service, maybe because I'm in the service industry myself, but NO should never be in your vocabulary when dealing with clientile.

Restaurants one of the best in the world , again excellent service, food taste very unique, having lived in New York and Los Angeles , this place packs a strong punch. 

However, having been at the Wynn on opening day , which was utterly amazing , amazing customer service, currently I would have to unfortunately say that my experience was subpar. 

I checked in several hours before actual checking in  time of 3:00pm , waited till about 5pm , no one called , I asked several times the answer was your room was not ready. I'm very understanding , I never like to complain , I saw multiple people get there rooms after checking after me. Again I try to be respectful and very courteous. However seeing that nothing was happening I expressed my frustration , I was quickly accommodated to a low level no view , room that was subpar clean. Then front desk clerk offered me a upgrade to parlor suite for extra 150 a night!?? Very unprofessional , let's start providing adequate service before jumping the gun. 

I then requested room change they said we will have it ready I a few hours the following day, time comes for transition , responsive was oh we don't have that room anymore. Then after 2 days of frustration we received higher level floor room with a view. 

I realize that in Las Vegas everything has become all about money. If your a high roller you will get special treatment, if you are not too bad.

Overall, I would say that Wynn-Encore caters more to the younger crowd (in distinct contrast to Bellagio) but still has the games (at least at the higher limits) to appease the more hard-core gamers.  Encore, however, suffers from a fatal flaw with respect to noise from the dayclubs and nightclubs that would prevent me from recommending a stay at the hotel to anyone.

The noise problem was surprising, having stayed at many hotels on The Strip (all of which have nightclubs) and never encountering a problem.  What makes Encore particularly problematic is that one side of the hotel (the side overlooking the pools and Wynn golf course) is also exposed to two partially outdoor nightclubs (which also occasionally serve as pool dayclubs).  The beats can be heard in the mid-afternoon (which really isn't much of a problem) and then well into the 4am early morning, which would probably be torture for a light sleeper.  I am fortunately a pretty heavy sleeper (I used to live next to the Holland Tunnel)--while the noise was distracting, closing the curtains and turning the A\/C fan on high was just enough to fall asleep.  I would, however, strongly recommend to anyone staying at Encore, if you find out your room is on the pool\/golf course side and the front desk is unable to offer you another room, simply get your bags and head to a different property--there are plenty of other places to stay.

I actually liked the layout of my standard Encore Resort Suite.  While not technically a multi-room suite, a divider between the bed and the rest of the room sort of gives the feeling of a two-room suite, and the flat panel TV on the divider with swiveling base was clutch.  Mirrors on a whole side of the room also give the impression of more spaciousness, and floor-to-ceiling windows provide dramatic views of the golf course, pools, and desert mountains (though they also probably exacerbated the aforementioned noise problem).

Before really delving into the gaming specifics, I will state that the casino floor easily has the most consistently attractive drink servers of any casino I have been to.  If that is something that you count as enhancing your gaming experience, this is a certainly a bonus for Wynn-Encore.

As I mentioned before, Wynn-Encore really seems to cater to a younger crowd, and this is reflected in the table games.  There are an abundant number of blackjack games paying 6-to-5 on blackjacks and hitting soft 17--an automatic 1.61% hit to expected player return.  On the flip side, limits at these tables go as low as $10.  More standard blackjack tables maintain ""Dealer Hits Soft 17"" up through the $100 and even $200 limits, though there are some tables featuring ""Dealer Stays on All 17s"" at $100 (though possibly as little as 3--1 in the Encore Baccarat room and 2 just outside the Wynn Baccarat room).  Craps doesn't seem to be as popular at Wynn-Encore than other casinos, but limits are as low as $10 even during weekend-night primetime.  As for video poker, most mid-limit Jacks-or-Better paytables were at 9-5 with 9-6 JoB starting at $10 on certain machines.  (Be aware that 9-6 JoB earns Red Card points at a slower rate--1 point for every $15 coin-in rather than the usual $6 coin-in for most other video poker.)  For Super Times Pay fans, Encore has 9-5 JoB STP multi-play as low as $1\/credit--a game Caesar's Entertainment refuses to offer above 6-5.

Among other observations, I wasn't particularly impressed with any of the casual dining options at Wynn-Encore, and the resort has a dearth of late-night dining, with only the relatively small Allegro open until 6am.  The Nuclear Tipping Point channel loops an hour long documentary on ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  While it's easy to tune it out, the gaming floor music butchers your favorite songs from the 80's, 90's, and today.  And, as you would already be aware if you had taken any cab in Las Vegas, Steve Wynn is in love with his voice:  He narrates the cabs, the website, and the two hotel tour television channels.

Overall, had it not been for the hotel room noise problem, Encore could easily garner 3-stars, and if the food were improved, the resort would probably be competing for a 4-star review.  I wouldn't be totally averse to revisiting Encore but would need some assurance as to my room's susceptibility to the noise.",3,1,0

The room is beautiful, much nicer than the rooms at the Wynn, and not just because it's newer. There's a bit of an Asian motif with lacquered wood paneling on the walls, the beds are larger, the couch in the corner is a nice touch (not as comfortable as the ones in the Venetian suites), and the complimentary water bottles were much-appreciated.

Of all the years I've been to Vegas...I am a Vegas nut...I had the most memorable, stress free Vegas vacation PERIOD.  Hands down, Encore has won my heart.  I cannot and will not stay anywhere else when I'm in Vegas.  You just can't.  I will shell out the extra dough to stay here.  Here's why...  

Customer Service:
This is key.  From the moment we stepped foot into Encore, the staff was courteous, responsive, and genuinely concerned about our happiness.  -
 The Valet guys...
were happy and upbeat.  They ALL said hello...not just the one helping us.  They opened our car doors and the hotel entrance doors...every time.  When we left, the valet even asked if we had a great time and she wished us to come back again. 
  The Frontdesk Staff...
were overly nice...but in a good, genuine way.  Yes, the line was long, but they covered their bases by  having 2 staff members controlling the lines and letting people know where to stand.  They looked put together, from head to toe...not a hair out of place (trust me, I'd notice), not a finger nail chipped.
  Housekeeping....
really did their job.  They just didn't clean around our mess, they organized it.  They placed our magazines neatly on the table.  Placed new slippers next to our beds.  Neatly aligned our shoes.  AND placed chocolate squares next to our bedside tables. DAMN!
   The casino staff...
always smiled and greeted us with a ""Hello!  Are you enjoying your stay?""  They weren't trying to have us sign up for some stupid show, nor sign up for their Red Card, nor get us to stay another night.  

Sundries store...
IMPRESSIVE!  Who the hell cares about the stupid sundries store?  Well, we did since we forgot a couple of items...like toothpaste.  This is how I knew S.Wynn got his stuff together.  The sundries store just doesn't sell any ol' toothbrush...they sell the good toothbrushes.  They sell the good candy.  They sell nice jewelry, cups and other Vegas souveniers that you might find irritating, but weren't because everything in that store is just NICE.  I loved it.

The room...
Oh my GOD!  We were on the top floor with an awesome view.  But who cared about the view, with how well the room was put together?  All I can say is there was a remote for everything...even the curtains.  We didn't have to worry about getting up if we forgot to turn off the lights because the remote was at my bedside table.  The fridge was fully stocked.  I bet you'd have to pay an arm and a leg for a stupid Pepsi, but just knowing it was there...yeah, life's good.

Society Cafe...
was excellent.  Service, impeccable.  Food, supurb.  I had the black cod with manila clam chowder.  Our waiter made suggestions.  We followed what he said and were damn glad we did.  BTW...if you order the chocolate cake, make sure you have an extra stomach.  I'm talking 6 layers held together by fudge and white chocolate shavings.  Genius.  I embraced the pig and me.  It was decadent.

Decor...
red.  I'm biased.  I love red.  The red was a bit overwhelming, but it's not like it was tacky.  Details, folks, details.  Red was the backdrop.  It's red, so of course it stands out.  I'm sorry, but I've never seen a red chandellier.  Just the thought of one makes you wonder, but honestly, they were gorgeous.  The plantation and butterfly mosaics were well placed.  Encore put much thought into their decor.  I can't come up with a better way they could have decorated the place.  It's unique and shows alot of personality.

In all, Encore knows what their doing.  Their staff really made a difference.  I've stayed at other hotels in which, yeah, the hotel was nice and we paid alot of money to be there, but money can't buy genuine kindness.  And that's why Encore will be my home away from home when I go back to Vegas.

We stayed at the King Suite on the 22nd floor, measuring 750 sq feet. Our room had a decent view at the very end closest to Wynn bldg. of partial strip. On Saturday night at 1am, we discovered that our room was situated on the site closest to XS. Thankfully, the queen bed was comfy enough to fall asleep and try to drown out the constant bass and nightclub noises coming from XS nightclub.  

Room amenities was typical of any luxury Vegas hotel: posh, beautiful lighting, tv in bathroom, LCD tv (with HD channels) that rotated between bedroom and living room. The blinds\/shades and lights could be accessed via a wired control adjacent to bed.

I didn't like how we were charged $14\/daily for internet access or the fact that we couldn't get a ""late check-out"" of 1pm versus 12pm regular. I guess they prefer us downstairs and gamble in their machines while we wait for airport transportation.

Beware of the magnetically-equipped in-room food service. Turns out that $8 Fiji water bottles and ridiculously-priced ($4 for a small box of peanuts?!) boxed snacks were placed on a magnet that charges the room if out place for more than 60 seconds. Talk about high-tech robbery!

Casinos downstairs and overall decor of hotel was spectacular and over-the-top. Plenty of slot machines and table to entertain even the die-hard of gamblers. I played a few games of blackjack and left empty-handed (damn you Wynn!)

I would've given the Encore a 5\/5 if the XS nightclub noises were more enclosed and if room service would've let us check out a little later than usual... well, after they gave us FREE INTERNET access!!

PS\/ I found a great deal on Travelocity ($550 for 3 nights at Encore with two roundtrip tix from SFO to Vegas). Check it out!",3,1,0

My friend tried asking concierge if there was any way they could place us on the guest list for XS, but I guess they said they couldn't do anything for us. Not too sure how correct that policy is because for whatever reason we picked the inebriated person to call concierge.

From the moment you step foot on the Encore \/ Wynn campus you feel some type of way! The amazing smell of the resort is un-paralleled and the flower arrangement is the best there is.  While you walk through the beautiful entrance there are plenty of helpful security to direct you to where you need to go.  The rooms are ridiculously nice and comfortable and make you feel right at home.  All the detail in the resort puts this place on top. From the tiles on the floor to the way the napkins in the pool bathroom are laid out everything is an A+.  Also they have plenty of wonderful places to grub.  We hit Mizuni on Sunday night which was amazing and can't beat the view of the waterfall while eating some foie gras and sushi!  We also dined at the society cafe which made some elite bloody Mary's and bomb chicken wings. Also took down the buffet on tues which is always one hell of an experience! My favorite buffet in Vegas hands down!  Don't sleep on their gelato selection so make sure you save room for dessert.  Had so much fun gambling at the tables as well. We spent about 4 hours at the War table drinking and laughing and enjoying life.  Faith was our favorite dealer and made sure everyone was having a blast.  Also just when you thought life couldn't get any better laying poolside drinking a coconut mojito the pool staff brings you sliced oranges.  Can't wait to be back on the grounds Nov.6 for my GFs bday.  Thank you Steve Wynn,0,0,0

There's no way anyone in their right mind would anyone pass that opportunity up. The hotel is definitely in the upper echelon in Vegas' hotel classes. Our room view overlooked the pools and at night, you can see XS in action.

By the time I got to the Wynn, the room type that I had booked was sold out. Erin from the front desk sent me over to a nice room at the Encore, a connected and adjacent property. It was a great little suite. The linens and the furniture were all top notch. All of my colleagues who had gotten rooms at the Wynn were impressed with the room at the Encore. Thanks Erin.

The overall level of service was high. The staff, from the front desk receptionist, to the servers, to the bartenders (Heather at the Parasol Bar), were all friendly and helpful. I was just killing some time playing low stakes roulette and ordered a White Russian. The drink came back in minutes and it was no different than the drink I ordered at the Parasol Bar the night before.

We had to move to another room (annoying, but fine, I understand they were booked). 

I did some major shopping while we were there, and I purchased some lingerie\/underwear which went missing (around $300). This is mere pennies compared to the amount I spent on clothing, shoes and jewelry, however I'm really just upset about the way I was treated by the staff, which is horrible, and unacceptable at a five star hotel.  I filed a report and was called within a day and told, ""We are sorry, we conducted an investigation and found no misconduct and 'unfortunately' we will not be compensating you"". I asked them to please elaborate on what the investigation entailed and the person, like a robot, just kept repeating, ""unfortunately we will not be compensating you"" over and over. I never got any information! How exactly did they ""conduct an investigation"" in one day, and if they did, what did that entail? I don't actually believe the hotel did anything to find my items. 

I don't necessarily think there was ""theft"" or ""misconduct"" - after all, I left several $5000 -$7000 chanel\/dior\/louis handbags and multiple $1000+ shoes in the room, as well as $10000+ jewelry on the counter at any given time... so I don't think that housekeeping stole my lingerie. What I DO think probably happened was they grabbed what they thought was trash (the tissue paper in which my lingerie was wrapped from the store) and negligently just tossed it in the trash. Either way, somehow it has gone missing and it could only have gone missing from that hotel room, because after we left the Forum shoppes we returned to the hotel and dropped off the purchases. They NEVER left the room! So I know that either a.) they were stolen or b.) they were thrown away. 

There were a lot of little annoying things that happened throughout our stay, such as the room not being cleaned by the time we returned back, and random phone calls at all hours. However those things can be forgiven. However, it really does bother me that the Wynn\/Encore staff just seem to not care at all or take my claim seriously. What if it was a more expensive item that went missing?! would they just tell me sorry, nothing we can do and hang up?? 

The hotel itself is definitely nicely appointed, however there are several other 5 star hotels to choose from so next time we fly out we will stay elsewhere. If you do stay at the Wynn\/Encore, your things may go missing. So I highly suggest taking out travelers insurance or locking everything in your suitcase just to be safe.

Also, I am planning a bachelorette party in a couple months, booking a VIP suite and definitely will take my money elsewhere due to this hotel treating me so poorly.",8,2,1

Not kid friendly, no strollers allowed unless you are a guest and the ""elegant"" dining restaurants don't accept children younger then 5.  We got a king suite for $149 a night with a $50 resort credit.  Since we can't dine at the nicer places, we chose the buffet, which was a nice surprise.  Paid $35 a person, charged to room to use the resort credit.  Ate one too many alaskan crab legs and felt sick.  I still haven't manage to control myself at buffets.  No matter how slow or how little I get, I always wound up overeating.  I think the liege waffle pushed me over.  Watched alot of tourists munch on the pizza ($35 for cheese pizza?).  Hotel was able to provide a crib for our 10 month old.  It is a smaller crib, not the normal full size.  If you have a big baby, he\/she might feel claustrophobic.  The bumper seems dense and worried me a little but our little one is not that mobile yet.  Overall suite was very nice, we had a view of Circus Circus.  The morning coffee was a disappointment.  Their coffee bar is right near the elevators and was a tad expensive for the type of coffee you get.  Don't get the breakfast croissant sandwiches, oily and greasy, felt ripped off for paying $9 for that crap.

The room was huge, with a dining area, massage room, living room, bar area, large bedroom, and an amazing bathroom! 

The check-in desk was in a private and elegant area. We were served bottled water while we waited. An additional hotel rep came to greet us personally and we were given her business card if we needed anything during our stay.

Our room came with in-room breakfast every morning. At night we would call in our order from a pre-selected menu ( items such as French toast, oatmeal, omelet, eggs\/bacon, croissant sandwich, etc), as well as coffee\/tea.  In the evenings, we would get turndown service. Slippers were set out, the lights dimmed, chocolates next to the bed, and fresh bottles of water set next to the bed for us. It was wonderful!

During our stay, we used the salon (and barber shop) and spa, as well as the golf course, saw Le Reve. Every employee was wonderfully accommodating, and so polite. The hotel is so much quieter than the Wynn, and feels much more intimately classy. And it smells so good! I bought the scented oils sold in the Home Store so that I could experience it at home!

If you can't decide between the Encore and Wynn, you can't lose either way. I personally liked the Encore more, for the fact that it was quieter and more intimate. However, most of all the attractions (shows, golf course, shops, sports book, etc) are at the Wynn, so we did a lot of walking! The Wynn is just as beautiful, the rooms are large and gorgeous, and it is convenient to every want and need you may have.

Just came back from one AMAZING birthday trip in Las Vegas.  I was offered a free stay at Encore for a few days and could not pass this offer up.  Encore is very impressive and compliments the Wynn perfectly.

Rooms: Each room is a suite and I stayed in one of the mini-suites with a spectacular view of the Wynn and the Vegas strip.  The living room area is complete with a desk and sectional couch and ottoman.  The plasma is mounted on a base that swivels so you can watch TV in either the living room area or while laying in bed.  The windows are one of the room highlights stemming from the floor to the ceiling giving a massive view of Vegas (the higher the better I always say).  The curtains and shade are controlled remotely with 1-touch buttons next to the bed.

The bedroom is fantastic!  Complete with a super comfortable bed (I had a King size) and quality sheets, iPod radio dock, plasma TV, and a wall that is a giant mirror.  There is also a dresser and plenty of room for clothes.  The decor is modern and playful.  The closet is a nice size.  Rooms have a stocked mini-bar and extras...the extras are really tempting as they are all top notch items including the Fiji water. 

The bathroom is expected with 2 sinks, large mirror, tv monitor, bathtub (just a good size), and a large glass shower with option to use a handheld shower wand.  The toilet is also private with it's own door and telephone.  I'm big on using nice toilet paper and the Encore proves not to skimp on the small stuff.  The toiletries are the same as the Wynn and complete with Shampoo, Conditioner, Bodywash, shoe polish, mitt, cotton swabs, and more.  The towels are nice and large and also soft and there is a nice stock of them provided.  Complimentary bathrobes are included to use for your stay and with turn down service...slippers and a chocolate are left for you and your partner (if you have one.)

Restaurants: Ate at Sinatra and it was fantastic.  See separate YELP review.

Service: Encore literally provides service with a smile as each employee greeted me in the hallways with a smile.  I also used the phone to call front desk and to make dinner reservations and the staff was attentive and very helpful.

A big plus is that not only is the hotel gorgeous, but also the waitress staff.  Each seemed to be hand selected from a modeling agency. 

Amenities: I was able to check out the pool area and can not wait to come back in the summer.  It was a bit too cold still to take a dip, but the scenery was just beautiful.  The pool area is surrounded by a garden and each pool area was plush with nice seating (not the cheap stuff found at other hotels) and complimentary water and towels are provided.  Similar to the Wynn is the classy and chic feeling when at the pool, not like being at Rehab  at the Hard Rock or Mandalay Bay's pool area.  There is a gaming area as well and a European (21+) area that completes the poolside experience.

Gaming is also great at Encore as I was able to find the tables and slots that I normally play when at the Wynn with ease.  It sometimes was actually easier to get a seat in Encore.  I especially liked the blackjack tables because they had a nice wooden section in front where you could easily set  your chips on and your drink without the risk of catching the dirt that felt often accumulates underneath your fingernails when playing with the chips.  The games I found to be average price of most casinos.  While gaming I was able to order a variety of cocktails, beers, and even a hot chocolate at 4am that hit the spot nicely...and I highly recommend if you're trying to sober up.

Red Card is a great feature.  As my room card doubled as my player's card and works for both the Wynn and Encore.

Shopping is as expected amazing and similar to the Wynn with an Esplanade connecting the Encore to the Wynn.  I found that there were a few shops that if I had more cash to burn I would have loved to check out including Rock & Republic, Hermes, and Ensemble. 

I wasn't able to check out the fitness area or spa on this trip.

Entertainment: I was able to check out both the nightclub XS and the show Le Reve (again.).

XS was a little slow, but then again it was a Sunday night.  That still didn't stop good music from being played with a mix of the top hits.  The club itself is beautiful.  The dance floor opens to the outdoors and you can see the pool area.  Shapes of the female body were in gold behind the bars.  The drinks were pricey, but what do you expect from Vegas.  I must admit the club is a little smaller than I would have imagined and the go-go dancers weren't that great dancers.  

Le Reve for the 2nd time was just as good as the first.  A great show with a mini-story.  The acrobatics and stunts are just crazy.  The music and lights fit perfectly with the entire show.  The cast of characters leave you feeling like you just woke-up from an extraordinary dream.

I had a wonderful experience at the spa, and also at many of the restaurants on property, but there were a few trouble spots with my stay that really disappointed me and will prevent me from returning in the future.  I will also note that it is far more difficult to get a cab at Encore than it is at other properties--waiting thirty minutes in forty-degree weather is not optimal, but I digress.

During check-in, the hotel's reservation system crashed, so I had to wait far too long to get checked in.  I understand these things happen, so no big deal.  When I got to the room I discovered that the bathroom had not been restocked with towels or toiletries, which made me question whether the room had been adequately cleaned.  I also quickly discovered that the internet did not work, and would not work reliably at all during my stay.  I also found that cell phone reception was spotty at best throughout the hotel.  Also annoying was that the shower head was broken. The first evening of my stay, I also came to notice that the room was not cooling down despite the thermostat being set at sixty-five degrees.

The second day of my stay, I went to the front desk at 8:00 a.m. to report the internet, air conditioner, and shower head problems.  The staff told me the issues would be fixed promptly.  Eight hours later, I returned to my room to find that zero of my issues had been fixed.  At that point, I became frustrated and went back to the front desk to request a new room.  My request was granted, so I then schlepped all my bags to a different floor and settled in.

I was very pleased with the new room and found everything about it to to be great.  I was especially impressed with the housekeeping staff.  The rest of my stay went off without a hitch until I tried to complete an expedited checkout and found that my original booking credit had not been applied to my account, so I had to call down to the front desk at five in the morning to get that straightened out.  

On the whole, our stay was nice, but I don't expect to have to deal with so many issues when staying at a five-star hotel.  I have stayed at all the other five-star hotels on the Strip, and this, sadly, was the worst experience I have had.  Had my visit not kicked off with so many problems, I might feel differently. All that being said, I can't really find any reason at this point to choose Encore over any other luxury brand.",3,1,0

I dont know it was because of newyears or what. First as we enter the room we saw FINGER NAILS on the table stand. I ask the concierge to clean them up and they didnt do anything about it. The Housekeeping manager was to do something abput it but didint. 

Second, i went again to the concierge to do reservations at Misumi resturant. Later that night when we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation. I had my confirmation number and everything. I had to wait like 1 hour for the table, and the hostes there was rude. 

Third. I left my passport cover in my room the day I left. I called Lost and Found to see if they were able to shipp it. They were very helpful.But when my passport cover arrived it was missing 100 USD!!

 The bell\/door staff was really great and Katie at checkin was extremely helpful. The only hiccup in the staffing that I encountered was one slightly rude woman at the Sundries shop.

 This is definitely a more mature crowd, so if you are looking for a nice place that feels like a party, you'll be better off at another hotel.

Though, it does feel like pure decadance nowadays to have that Strip room when home is 15 mintues away.  Encore definitely provides a luxurious, resort experience.  

No signs of a recession here, there was a line to check in, and the hotel was sold out.  I chose to upgrade the room for $25 to a higher floor, with better view.  It was the best choice I made all weekend (because gambling certainly didn't offer the same return).  The view was amazing - straight down was the pool, beyond was the golf course and further out you could see Caesers and the rest of the Strip.  Just as fun at night as during the day!  I loved retiring to the plush bed, and looking out at the view, then with a touch of a button both curtains close to block out all traces of light!  Equally nice is the spacious and comfortable bathroom.  I took a bath in the deep tub and watched the Today show.  

Not so nice was the gambling.  I liked that your room key was the Player's card.  But on a Saturday night when the place was mobbed by short skirts and heels trying to get into XS, I wanted to play Blackjack.  There wasn't a spot open for less than $50 a hand, and when I sat down to what seemed like a $10 table it turned out to be Blackjack ""Switch.""  Some variation where you bet on two hands, and you can change the cards up... not so much fun when the dealer doesn't bust on 22!

The Encore strives to create a St. Tropez feel, which I think it does -  large windows overlooking a lush pool and lots of light even in the casino.  It's a relaxed environment, not found in many of the other casino\/hotels on the Strip.  One day, I'd like to return... after I won the MegaMillion jackpot.",2,0,2

I'd never stayed here before.  Staff was very nice when we checked in even though we were standing in the wrong place where the ropes were laid out at check-in.  Nobody else was in line so they didn't give us any grief and were very kind.  

It was an overall good experience.  We had a room on the 52nd floor, a premium suite with a view.  It was a nice, clean and spacious room.  Comfortable bed.  Decor was in great shape which is surprising considering it is a blonde furniture with off-white accents in the chairs and the bathroom vanity stool.  I imagine very hard to keep clean.  But, I'm only giving it three stars because of two complaints:  

1.  The shower head in our bathroom was a little wonky.  If we had of been staying longer I would have called down and asked to have them fix it or move us to another room with a better shower head.

2.  Although beautiful to look at, once you picked them up to use them, the towels felt like sandpaper!  Easily could use them to exfoliate.  I'm not sure how they could improve this.  Maybe some fabric softener or a different fabric towel.

I also made sure to inform the person checking us in of our horrible housekeeping experience on our last visit and that to please explicitly inform housekeeping NOT to enter our room when the privacy sign was illuminated. I watched her make this note. 
Then, lol and behold, housekeeping tries to enter our room TWICE when the privacy sign is illuminated during this visit without even waiting or announcing themselves! I was livid.

I received a promotional package from Wynn in June, promising two complementary show tickets for two nights stay, which induced me to make a reservation for thanksgiving. At the time of the booking, Wynn web site listed the two show tickets as part of the deal. However, it did not let me choose the way to get the tickets. I figured that they would give me the tickets when I check in.

Well, today I just called to book the show time because we will also have a Grand Canyon tour on the same trip. The woman at concierge told me that they blocked the show tickets for thanksgiving in October, and that if I had called earlier, I would have gotten the tickets. She even commented that for complementary things in life, I should have been more proactive in pursuing them. 

I was not happy after learning of this. For God's sake, I made the reservation in June before they gave the notice of the blackout dates. Had I known that thanksgiving holidays was blocked out, I probably would not have booked.

Granted that the room rate I received was probably still a good deal even without the tickets, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. It is not about the money any more. I felt being taken in. I guess that it is just that sense of not being fair. They promised something, but failed to deliver. I even recommended some of my friends to go using the promotion code they gave me. It is difficult to find another hotel now that it is so close to thanksgiving, but if there is a deal on Groupon, I will for sure take the advantage of it, and cancel my reservation at Wynn.",3,0,0

We got an insane deal through Southwest airlines - and after dealing with Southwest (never again I swear) we were ready for some posh accommodations and some quiet.

Well, Encore is the party hotel version of the Wynn. The crowd is younger and expect lots of bachelorette\/bachelor party groups. Seriously, as we turned the corner to head down the hallway to our room, a group of drunk girls were racing each other down the hallway - screaming and giggling and falling down...We had a bachelor party next door...yay us. Luckily we really weren't in the room much and were drunk enough to pass out without being too bothered by the ruckus.  

The service is outstanding - every detail of the hospitality side is immaculate. 

We stayed in a base-level room on the 25th floor, facing the strip - lovely views. The room was nice but one MAJOR gripe about the design.

The bathroom is nice with a large, heavy door separating it from the hallway. However, the bathtub has a paper thin sliding door next to it that opens into the bedroom. Sexy, yes...unless someone needs to go number two. You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in that bathroom. The echo off the marble floors and walls (and no fan to cover sounds or remove smells) makes it all the way to the sitting area. You'll be tempted to send your partner off with a twenty dollar bill to have some privacy!

Our favorite thing about staying here was the European pool. No charge and no kids! :)

It was interesting, because I had never met the bachelorette before, and I ended up being one of 5 girls that showed up (that's another sad story all together). 

My good friend and new friend drove up to Vegas together, and met the rest of the bachelorette party there. We were pointed to the VIP entrance and entered the foyer. Very pretty and exclusive. The bride to be was at the front desk making a scene as the room we were supposed to stay in was not ready, and apparently not vacated by the people staying in the night before. This was pretty upsetting to the bride to be and lots of yelling ensued.

Anyhow, shortly after that we were accommodated for with a room that was being cleaned at the very moment, and so we didn't have to wait very long at all!

As we went up the elevator to the 7th floor, we walked down the hall to the very end. Double doors. Nice. Opening the doors you walk into a small entry way with a beautiful golden gilded piece of art on the left, a large mirror on the right and a small door leading to a private massage room with table included for in room spa services! Wow!

It's hard to explain how ginormous this place was (3000sq ft)... the living room and dining room were huge with a tv almost the size of one wall. A window reaching from one end of the room to the other spanned in front of us. Wow. That's really all I could say. 

One room and bathroom at the end of the hall to the left, another bedroom and bathroom at the end of the other hall to the right. On the way to the left bedroom, a vanity room and extra toilet. Also a hallway that led to an exit, which seemed to be some sort of service entry! On the way to the bedroom on the right, a kitchen with sink, and full sized refrigerator. 

The bar was in the dining room, completely stocked... The decor was very tasteful and elegant, not too gaudy. 

The service was extremely wonderful, as we were served a free bottle of champagne, basket of fruit and chocolate covered strawberries for the inconvenience of waiting.

Encore is a relatively small property, that focuses on being an exquisite hotel experience, rather than a casino resort. You don't need to walk through the casino to get to your room. You don't need to stand in crazy taxi lines. And you certainly don't need to push your way through big crowds of tattooed meatheads to get a drink at the bar.

But you will experience unparalleled luxury & comfort in your suite, that you will not find anywhere else on the Strip, even at the adjoining Wynn resort. My love for any hotel comes down to the room. I like to be comfortable & feel like I'm at home. This is tough to find in Vegas. Encore does it the best. 

Of course it's not just the room. Everything is here at Encore. You really don't need to leave the property if you don't want to. 

Encore was designed as Wynn's little boutique sister. Bigger is not better here. Better is better. That goes for every little detail in the room & the various services (e.g. gym, room service, housekeeping, concierge) that you may well use.

This is Las Vegas. You can have anything you like. Literally anything. You just have to choose what's right for you & then pay for it accordingly. Encore is tremendous value compared to hotels of similar quality around the world. But compared to other hotels on the Strip, it's obviously more expensive than most. 

The vibe is sophisticated luxury, Las Vegas style. If that's your style, stay at Encore & thank me later.",0,0,0

Tremendous attention to detail in design and architecture, friendly attentive staff. The casino is magnificent, covered in drapery and plantation shutters, its intimate and, well, serene. In fact, this may trouble you casino ""players"" as the action is high stakes but subtle and subdued. 

The standard for cleanliness at every corner of this property is amazing. The air has a light fragerance.The lovely lighting and exotic melange or restaurants makes for spectacle and intrigue. This is an edifice of luxury and high design. 

But alas, this property does not, in my view, deserve the 5-star Mobil and AAA award. 

Here are some curious misses: 

-The rooms have some tricky and wonderful electronics to create mood lighting, open and close the curtains and drapery remotely, etc. But as is customary in nearly all fine hotels, the bellman did not give us a tour or explain any of the amenities. We only figured out how to use all the options on the day we departed. 

-There is no turn down service. I don't really require this, but that is a hallmark of 5 star hotel. 

-No paper delivery, no little perks like water. In fact they do not replace soaps , body wash, etc. To be fair, when we asked for more, we were delivered quite a nice array of products in abundance. But its strange you have to ask. 

- While the TV was HD and flat the channel seection was sparse and clumsy, the remote difficult to use, the pay for movie selection too short. I've been in Best Westerns that have a more user friendly and attractive interface. 

- No in-room coffee, but you can order 4 cups  from room service for $16..

As a comparison, four star rated Kimpton properties are far superior on the negative points mentioned above. 

Lastly, after spending thousands of dollars in the hotel and wanting an extra hour at checkout to enjoy Sunday bunch, we were given a rather terse rebuke. 

Encore is not to be missed, its a fanciful wonderful property, but if you are expecting a true 5 star experience, Mr. Wynn misses, despite his dulcet tones and soothing understated braggadocio you hear on his unending in-room and website commercials.",6,4,4

   We had an ongoing problem in our room and it wasn't addressed until two days of complaining. We had been encouraged to pay extra for an upgrade and we took them up on the opportunity. 
  What we got? A smelly problem that turned out to be a SEWER back-up problem that was a frequent issue with a lot of the floors at this part of the Wynn\/Encore Hotel. Our clothes smelled like this awful odor too. We tried to get them cleaned, but were refused. When we spoke to a hotel manager we were told that the person we needed to speak to wasn't available for two more days. A huge hotel and no one in customer service? Really? We were only offered a champagne fruit and cheese plate for our trouble and

The wynn located near old downtown on the northside of the strip. The architecture of the building is amazing. But the art inside is what makes this hotel beautiful. If you have the time take a look at the walls. Theres beautiful art everywhere you look. Paintings. Glass sculpture. Flower scultptures. Even crotchet art. 

Parking is easy and a no brainer. Its easy to snag a spot and the layout makes it easy to find your car. But everytime i check in here. I almost never leave this amazing hotel. Theres so much great things here theres actually no reason to leave.

The best part here is that its kid friendly. Even at the pool. The clientele is mostly europeans, south americans or canadians! They are also the most posh and fit people on the strip. I love the chill atmosphere here. To relax and feel like a queen. I always come back.

From the moment you check in. Be astounded by the impeccable service you will recieve. Friendly and personable the staff are attentive and friendly. The elevators are guarded by  staff to ensure nobody gets through without a room key. The elevators are super fast. I find it just takes seconds and one comes. And they are never jam packed. They are high tech and move quick too. 

The rooms are luxurious. Soft matresses and feather down pillows. Robes are provided and all amentitiez needed for your stay. So dont bother bringing anything. Its pretty much all provided. The lights and curtains are controlled by an ipad type screen beside your bed. Ive had rooms with a great strip view of the pool, and the palazzo. On the mountain side is a more scenic view of old downtown. Both are great. But they say the strip side can be louder. But i never noticed. Bc the rooms are soundproof. So quiet, i never heard my neighbors once in all my stays. 

The rooms have a big bed with a large tv screen that swivels 360 degrees to the couch and desk side. The operations on the tv are simple and straightforward and exceptionally fast. With great wifi that never lags too. Only issue for me is that you pay $15.99 a device for internet. But for the speed its actually reasonable. Ive had paid resort fees twice that price with unlimited devices and have had issues staying on for longer than 10 minutes without issues.

The pool is so nice here. Its heated so even in the winter its a comfortable temperture. The encore pool is more intimate. With a more family vibe and a great breeze. Theres also plenty of spots with lots of shade. They even do rounds of fresh sliced oranges complimentary in the summer. You also have access to the wynn pool too. Its a bit of walk only through the hotel. But its more crowded there. 

The restaurants are superb. Great food. Cafe society, terrace cafe, mizumi...every place ive gone too are amazing. Authentic. With impeccable service. I highly recomend the omekase with kobe beef at mizumi. Its better than at nobu!

First, the positives. We made a mistake and checked in at the Wynn. However, registration enabled us to check-in there. Be prepared for a significant wait in line which we also experienced the night before at the Mandalay Bay.  Perhaps casinos have not heard of the high unemployment rate in Nevada and do not realize that they could hire more, qualified persons.  Back to the positive, though.

The 700_ sq. ft. suite was magnificent, 2144, overlooking the golf course, the resort and European pools and the strip towards Treasure Island, Trump, etc.  Highlights also included the shower and the remote that controlled the sheers and drapes.  For sleeping, we chose complete darkness over the otherwise great alternative of the nightlights of the other city that never sleeps.

We enjoyed a relaxing weekend with one day at the resort pool and two days at the Wynn resort pool.  The Encore resort pool would have been extremely hot during this time of year without having found an umbrella-covered setting in the third row.  The only minus would be that the two rows in front almost entirely block views of the pool.

We trekked through the 'European pool' at the Encore and found it to merely be a pool.  Topless sunbathing does not a European pool make, to be sure.

By far, our favorite was the Wynn Resort pool.  We were late risers and had difficulty finding two lounge chairs in the shade, however we were eventually successful.  My husband sited another guest ensconced in the shade in the water under one of the walkway overpasses along the canal ,and we essentially spent two days therein the water and shade, enjoying adult beverages and conversations with all of the friendly guests from San Francisco, Germany, and Great Britain, and the great view.

Now, for the negatives.  When in Las Vegas, or, for that matter, wnen on any vacation, we usually only use the suite for naps and overnight sleeping.  In our Encore room, overnight sleep was impossible until 6:00 a.m. Sunday a.m. and 4:00 a.m. other nights due to the pounding tribal beats emanating from the Wynn and Encore outdoor pool nightclubs below.  The Encore in fact just opened 'Surrender' in the Beach Club the week prior.  Seemingly, Steve Wynn, despite his penthouse suite, is unaware of soundproofing (just FYI, we were able to hear phone conversations of guests in the adjoining room in Encore!). 

Registration and front desk personnel were apologetic and reported numerous similar complaints.  Indeed, our new friend from Manchester, England reported having the same problems sleeping in her 44th floor room in the Wynn.  Until this hotelier soundproofs the Encore, this resort no longer deserves either a 4- or 5-star rating.",3,2,1

It is even more elegant than Wynn and isn't as gaudy as Bellagio or The Venetian.  From check in to check out, we had a flawless experience.  Check in only took 10 minutes and we were fortunate enough to get  a 'complimentary upgrade' to the end of the 55th floor with a panoramic view of the strip.  Our room was tasteful, gorgeous, and being so new, in top form.  The bathroom is huge and stocked with everything you need and complete with all of the details that go into a perfect bathroom: deep tub, Speakman shower head, lighted magnifying mirror on stand, sit down vanity, separate w\/c, dual sinks, and convenient tv.  Bed was outfitted in nice linens and was ever so comfy!  42""HD flat screen tv on a swivel base was great for viewing either in bed or while on the sofa and the desk was equipped with plenty of outlets for the laptop and cell phone charging.  

The casino is just big enough with a boutique hotel feel.  Not too crowded and barely smokey.  Even the public bathrooms were great!  We dined at many of the restaurants within the Wynn\/Encore and most were quite good.  Preferred the Encore casino to the Wynn and was disgusted by The Venetian, Palazzo, Caesars, and even The Bellagio-it was like night and day between their casinos and Encore's.  If you want frat clientele, go to Caesars.  If you want upscale elegance with a hip vibe, hit Encore.

We previously stayed at the Wynn, but had such a dodgy experience last time that we decided to try Encore. I am soooo glad we did because it blows the Wynn away. This hotel is really wonderful.

Decor and ambience - 5 stars
Love the incredible red decor. It's warm and inviting yet funky and bright! The layout is convenient and seems smaller than most casino hotels in Vegas. This is a good thing to me as you don't feel like you are walking forever from the entrance to get to your room like some hotels.

Location - 3.5
It is located on the north end of the strip, so it's not as convenient as most of the hotels for walking to everything. We had to shell out serious cash for cabs. 

The Rooms -  5 Stars 
We had a room facing north towards the Hilton hotel. Great view, amazingly well appointed, and best of all QUIET!! That for me is a major point our room at the Wynn was not quiet at all.

The Staff - 4.5 Stars
Very courteous and incredibly helpful everywhere we went. I love that they always used my name when I picked up the phone no matter what department I contacted. No one appeared to be indifferent or have an attitude which can happen at some hotels.

The Euro\/Adult Pool -  5 stars
Great Music, fun vibe in the afternoon, decent bar tenders, and not overly crowded. Only a few dare to bare so don't let your puritanical American mind fret too much over this fact.

Prepare to Pay and Pay Big - 3.0 stars
Nothing is cheap in Vegas, but it blows me away that hotels can charge $15 dollars for a shot and $11 and up for drinks. That is highway robbery and thank GAWD we don't gamble because we certainly spent plenty of money on food and dining. 

Encore Beach - 3.5 stars
The pool party on Saturday was outta sight fun!! This pool area is huge and definitely one of the nicer pools around Vegas. My only gripe is they didn't have enough bartenders to handle the crowd size. It's LDW and the pool was jam packed. I kinda felt bad for the bartenders because they looked slammed and never seemed to get a breather. Guess that's part of the job, but I didn't like having to wait 20 mins for a drink and I never saw a server come our way.

Spa - 3.5 stars
Pricey but well worth saving your pennies if you have a special night and want to get your makeup done. The makeup artists and hairstylists at Encore are amazing!! We also got mani\/pedis, but they were nothing to write home about.

Dining - 
Society Cafe - 4 stars - I will write a separate review for them, but we ate breakfast and lunch here. Nothing special nothing horrible either.

Breakfast Buffet 2.5 stars in the Wynn - $40 per person - Seriously WTF! It was quite the spread but certainly not worth the price. 

Pool food -2.75 Asian salad ok but nothing special. Luckily the servers were super nice and really helpful.

Lobby bar by the elevators - 0 stars
Whatever you do STAY AWAY from the lobby tapa bar. I had the worst food poisoning from eating bad shrimp. It ruined an entire evening and night of my 4 day trip. Luckily, I recovered enough the next day to enjoy what was left of our stay. I will say that the hotel did send up security to check on me and so I could file a report.

SW - 3.0 stars
Meh not the best food I ever ate. Server was decent, but I just can't believe they can charge $62 for 12oz filet and $12 per side with straight faces. - I will write a review soon because as nice as the dreamscape show and the level of service may be, it doesn't justify the exorbitant price to dine here. Also watch out the drinks here are incredibly strong!

Overall it averages out to be - 3.5 to 4.0 stars
Despite the one food poisoning blemish we will definitely stay there again. May not eat there again, but definitely a great room in a nice hotel.",3,0,1

Everything about our stay was impeccable, except for the service, which was often slow no matter which one of the bars\/restaurants we went to (which is why this is a 4 rather than a 5-star review). Despite a few shortcomings, I think the Encore the best resort in Vegas.

When compared to the other major casino-hotels on the Strip, the Encore is easily the most luxurious. From the moment you walk in the door you are surrounded by well-appointed decor and inviting spaces. 

Location: The Encore is about as far north on the Strip as you would want to go while still having easy access to major sightseeing on the Strip. You can walk across the sky bridge to the Venetian\/Palazzo, or you can Uber\/Lyft wherever you need to go (which is what we did the majority of the time).

Check-in\/out: 4\/5 stars. There was only a 2 person line to check in around 10:30 PM on a Thursday night, but there were longer lines during the day, so I can see why other reviewers had issues with this. Check-out was quick and there were no unexpected charges on my bill. Breakfast was included in our rate (it works by charging breakfast to your room, with the charges removed at check-out), and the desk agent removed it without me ever seeing the charge. 

The room: The room was simply fantastic. We had an Encore King Resort Suite, which was spacious and incredibly well-appointed. The only difference in the Resort Suite and Panoramic Suite is the floor level; the rooms are exactly the same. Our suite faced north (away from the Strip). This was a little disappointing at night, but during the day we could see the mountains in the distance, which was a great view in and of itself. Everything in the room was very well-maintained and modern. The bed faces a half-wall (where the TV sits) which opens into the living area. All of the lights and shades are automated. You can dim the lights, open\/close either the sheer and\/or solid curtains, change the temperature, set do-not-disturb, and request housekeeping all from the comfort of the bed. The bed itself was quite comfortable (not too soft and not too firm), and the sheets were crisp. The down duvet was quite comfortable. There were pillows in multiple sizes, and the one I used was soft, supportive, and exactly what I wanted (I didn't compare firmness). There is a mini bar with a wide variety of choices, including a snack\/amenity tray. It's a nice touch that you can get a smartphone cord or intimacy kit without having to call someone or go downstairs. 

Restaurants\/bars: There are a wide variety of restaurants and bars in the Wynn\/Encore complex ranging from bar food to fine dining. The drinks are overpriced (to be expected); you can expect to spend just under $20 per basic drink. The service was consistently slow, which really surprised me given that the resort itself feels palatial. The Lobby Bar was convenient for a quick drink\/snacks and was a nice place to meet before heading out or rest after hitting the pool\/casino. Parasol Down is outdoors and has a water show every 30 mins, but the service was absolutely glacial. It took 10-15 mins just to place our first order, and each round of drinks took at least 10-15 more minutes to receive. The only saving grace is that the cocktails were consistently delicious. 

If your rate includes breakfast, it can only be redeemed at The Buffet. The spread of food was absolutely incredible. There are at least 7 separate buffet sections, each the size of a normal buffet line, with a dedicated dessert buffet where you can watch the staff make a variety of treats. You can get everything from traditional breakfast food to Indian food and sushi (and this was all for breakfast!). They have made-to-order pancakes and omelets, eggs benedict,  at least 5 different parfaits, potatoes cooked in any number of ways, and that's just the simple stuff I can remember. The spread was impressive, to say the least; the only downside is the line to get in. Despite being surrounded by empty tables, we waited at least 15 minutes to be seated at a non-peak time. They won't seat incomplete parties either. 

Casino: The casino was clean and a ton of fun. The dealers were friendly and we had a great time gambling overall. It was definitely the nicest of any casino we went into.

Pools: The Encore has two pools, one regular and one European. The pools were nice, but it was very hard to find chairs. There were never enough people in the pool for every chair to be taken, which made me think the staff wasn't clearing towels away. The European pool has a bar on one end (though you have to climb out of the pool to order) with casino games as well.

Spa: The spa was fantastic. I got the custom massage, which was the best massage of my life. It was well worth the $170 price tag. Everything about the spa made me feel zen. You name it, this spa does it well (waterfall shower, cold\/warm pools, heated lounge chairs, steam room, sauna).",0,1,0

A few notes:

1. As mentioned before, check-in is understaffed and people working the check-in counter are either poorly trained or unmotivated. I had to ASK twice for an upgrade, the upgrade was not as described.

2. The food options in the hotel after 11pm were no where to be found. 

3. The casino is small and unimpressive. My colleague and I played $700 on roulette in 20 minutes and did not hear from or get the attention of a host.

4. The rooms are fine looking, but are poorly circulated and have a poor view of the strip or a view of old town (which is no fun to look at).

5. I like a good cigar, the humidors in the shop and at the bar are so poorly humidified, they are like rock hard candy.

Did you know?
- You can buy anything in the hotel... seriously*.  If you like the funky looking clock that's on your nightstand, you can buy it.  Like the little Buddha statue that's in the hallway by the elevator? You can buy it.  Like the glasses your martini was served in at the bar?  You can buy it.
*There is a store where you buy the items new, not used, silly.

The pool was nice. *WARNING*  Little kids close your eyes!  There are actually two pools, one for kids (family) and one for adults (and unfortunately horny college kids on spring break).  The adult pool is ""European"" style meaning women can be topless and men can rock the banana hammock.  The pool did get very crowded early (1030am-ish) so don't wait until 3pm to show up or you'll be left standing around staring at some fake double-D's and plum smugglers.

Keep in mind that this is the ""boutique"" part of Wynn so the casino may seem tame by Las Vegas standards.  If you want a rowdier crowd head over to Wynn's casino.

We ate at 3 restaurants; Wazuzu, Bartollota, and SW Steakhouse.  I'll do a separate review for each one, but in short, they were all good.

Make sure to get tickets to see Le Reve (how do I put a little upside-down ""v"" above the ""e"" in Reve?)  It was an awesome show.  Never have I been more amazed while watching bald, muscular albinos jump from 1000ft in the air into a glass of water.  It's insane!

The hotel location itself is around the newer areas of Vegas, right next to the Fashion Show Mall, which is perfect. And the food provided by the room service was tasty!

Problems, however, were present. For some reason, room service never decided to come in and change our towels and make our beds, even though we indicated that we wished them to. Also, the food provided by the room service (mentioned above) was a tad (pretty) expensive.

Love the separate living and bedroom area with a huge TV that swivels back and forth. Also loved the bathroom amenities and the shampoo that smells like Lemongrass.... so nice. Also the bed, bedding and decor of the room was perfect. I loved the remote switches that let you command the drapes, lighting and doorbell. I accidentally forgot to trip the privacy switch and the maid never cleaned our room. We called and a housekeeper was in our room freshing up within 20 minutes at 2AM.

The buffet at the Wynn is reasonable during the week as we got there right at 11AM, so we paid for the breakfast price at $19.99. The spicy tuna hand rolls and flank steak rock!!!!

The room was not ready (we were before check in time), so Trey recommended a place for lunch and directed us to the bell desk to drop off our bags. Throughout our stay, Trey helped us a number of other times and was outstanding each and every time. 
 
The room itself was very clean and well designed. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, there was no fridge (just a mini bar that costs $25 if you disturb the weight sensor to make a spot), coffee maker, or microwave.There was a desk, two TVs, a huge, beautiful bathroom, and remote controlled blinds and lights as well as an iron with a  full sized ironing board, a safe and a lot of drawers for storage.

The remaining nights were very quiet.

Be careful what you wear because you may be splashed but  not too badly.
 
Biggest downsides were we had ZERO cell reception (T-mobile and AT&T) in our room the entire time. You could access the hotels Wi-Fi for $13.99 a day per device, but they wave it for one device with their ""resort charge"". Another big downside is the location.

The suite included a spacious bath, king sized bed and an office\/living room. 

My favorite part of the room was the living room and office space. There is a couch set next to the window to relax and enjoy the view and my son acted CEO behind the office table as if he was writing me checks.  

The bath was roomy. Dual sink, small tv screen, shower stall and bath tub. Even called for room service for liquid to do a bubble bath. Good service by the way, our bubble bath didn't take long and they even followed up within minutes to make sure we got what we needed. 

The king bed was comfy. Their Samsung TV screen was cool too, I really wanted to take it home. Also you can swivel it to view while your in bed or in the living room. 

Encore's pool was decent. It's mid sized. It kinda felt awkward taking my family there, being most adults especially when you see obnoxious older guys trying to hookup on young chicks. They closed the pool area at 6 p.m. that day. So we were able to relax up for about an hour till close. The poolside service was great too, she followed up if my michelada was exceptional. Their spa and fitness areas looks high tier. 

Overall, the stay was great but I wouldn't recommend staying here if you have a young family. We decided to take a advantage of a deal through Expedia for that weekend. I recommend this stay for adults or with a group of friends.

I can't say which of the two properties I prefer, and it's a little tough to describe how the two properties differ from one another even through they are far from identical to one another.  I would say Encore has a more sedate feel to it overall. My sense is it does not get as many people wandering in from Las Vegas Boulevard as the Wynn.   

Although, like the Wynn, the Encore is a thoroughly modern Vegas hotel, it retains a lot of old Vegas feel to it in terms of scale and service.  Genuinely great service used to be a given in Vegas almost anywhere you went, but it's become increasingly rare.  I miss the old Vegas a lot, and the Wynn reminds me of the old Vegas even if it doesn't really look like the old Vegas.  

Our room was perhaps the nicest room we've stayed in in Vegas.  It was effectively a junior suite with a good sized sitting area adjacent to the bedroom area.  This room seemed larger than it's equivalent at the Wynn, but it might just be a different layout that seems larger.  

There are three nice sized pools on the property.  Two are for hotel guests only, and are about what you would expect for a luxury hotel in Vegas, which is to say they are very nice.  The third pool, Encore Beach Club, is open to anyone 21 and up willing to pay the entrance fee.  Think Rehab, Ditch Fridays, etc.  I think building a dedicated day club pool is a great idea.  It eliminates what would otherwise be an annoyance to guests who aren't down with the Bro's and Ho's pool scene (pretty much anyone over the age 30).  

Parking is a breeze unlike many Vegas properties.  The parking structure is easy to get in and out of and easy to park i, and the walk from the parking structure to the casino is basically nothing.  

If it's gambling, high end shopping, dinning, or nightlife you're after, Mr. Wynn's got you and your $$$$ covered sun up to sun up, basically, when you consider the late night club scene.  

One gripe:  When the pools close at 7:00, the staff could have been a little more diplomatic when telling people they must leave the ""regular"" pool area.  After three loudspeaker announcements, no one needs to be barked at while whey are leaving.  Don't treat hotel guests the same way I imagine you treat some of the Beach Club clientele, mkay?  On a separate occasion, when my buddy was near the Beach Club, which you walk past to get to Las Vegas Boulevard,  a staffer asked him curtly, ""can I help you?,"" when his tone suggested he really meant, ""what are you doing here?"" I would have replied, ""Yes, a cold bottle of water would be nice, thank you.""  

Notwithstanding the somewhat less than diplomatic approach to closing the pool, I doubt anyone would be disappointed staying at Encore. 

Bonus:  Tacos El Gordo is a short walk up the boulevard away.  The spicy pork tacos there are spectacular and worth the short walk up the boulevard to an admittedly somewhat rough around the edges shopping center in the shadow of Encore to get them.  The vast majority of the denizens of Encore will never make that walk and will never know what they are missing.",4,1,1

The pool area is fantastic especially the euro side where XS is at night.  I'm sure the summer party's are going to be a hit.   The Spa is absolutely gorgeous.  
The rooms are very nice and spacious.  I really enjoyed the shower. Water pressure was awesome. Might not sound like a big deal, but when you stay at a nice hotel with little water pressure you'll know what I'm talking about.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the paper thin walls!!
You could hear everything, I mean everything your neighbor was doing. 
My neighbors on the 60th floor must have been swingers or advertising on Craigslist cause I could hear moaning and groaning at night as well as breakfast!  There really was no sound barrier at all.

The problem with the Encore is that the staff is all smiles yet do nothing to provide good, or even DECENT customer service. They smile and say yes, of course, to everything we ask, yet they do not execute at all. 

Room service took 2 hours to reach us, and when it arrived, the food was all cold. The bellman asked for an amenity fruit bowl for us to be sent up to our room, and they tried to CHARGE us for something that is complimentary! The only person helpful was the room service manager who took the charges off of our bill and apologized.

But even though that was our first time staying in the hotel, we had visited the property many times before for the restaurants, clubs, and shops. But if you are staying at the hotel it is simply NOT WORTH IT to have people smile at you and then ignore you when you have a problem and need some help. 

All of the security people there, except for a very small minority, are either trained to be completely rude and jerks, or they are not trained at all how to speak to people properly and with respect. Even asking for simple directions to the closest bathroom in the casino draws eyerolling, rude stares, and impatient gestures from security staff. 

But that isn't the worst thing. My friend was hassled at the doorway to the guest suites when she tried to go in and sit in the lobby. We were staying at the Tower Suites and she had a key with her name on it, and the security guard told her that her key was fake and he wouldn't let her in. HOW do you FAKE a key with your name embossed on it by a machine?? Then her key was taken away from her while she was treated by a criminal by this jerk of a security guard. 

We are writing a formal letter of complaint. 

None of the managers offered to help us, or even give us any room or resort credit after being maltreated. Our business was definitely neither appreciated nor even wanted. We had booked a 3 night stay and we left after the 2nd night, we were so disgusted with the treatment at the hotel. The only thing that was done was not being charged for the 3rd night after we checked out early. Really? That's the very least that they could do after they treated us so terribly. Worst service we have ever experienced. 

We usually stay at the Aria and the Bellagio. We will NEVER go back to stay at the Wynn\/Encore. We stayed our last night at the Bellagio and yes, there were a few small issues but they were corrected immediately and with apologies by the staff, who are properly and stellarly trained to provide excellent customer service to EVERYONE. Not just high-rollers and celebrities. The policies at the Wynn\/Encore are dreadful and not oriented toward customer satisfaction. They don't care if you like them or not. They want your money and then they want you to leave, and they don't want to deal with any problems.

If you want great customer service, and you are not a millionaire, NEVER ever stay at the Wynn\/Encore.",6,8,1

The hotel itself is much quieter and not as chaotic as some of the other hotels on the strip even though it houses one of the best nightclubs in Vegas, XS.  Probably because it's on the far end of the strip away from a lot of the crazyness.

We stayed in a resort suite and it was perfect.  It was like staying in a posh little apartment.. very homey and a great view of the pool and part of the strip.  They offered an upgrade for $20 more per night to a panoramic suite but who wants a quiet view of the mountains?!?  I don't know about calling that an upgrade, but to each his own.  The room had a rotating tv so you could watch from the bed or living area.  Everything is electronically controlled, including a doorbell!  No having to hang privacy signs here.

The scale and fancy makeup mirror in our bathroom were broken but they replaced both in a jiffy and then called about 5 times to make sure everything was okay afterwards.  We also told them there was no shampoo in our room and they brought up cute little bags full of amenities.  Very nice!

We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were okay.  The downside is there are no quick\/casual eats here, only sit down restaurants.  

My only other complaint is the $25 per day resort fee.  I know every hotel has a resort fee, but it was such a waste because we didn't use the pool or gym during our stay and the wireless internet was spotty and didn't work the majority of the time.

Despite some drawbacks, this is one of my favorite hotels on the strip.",1,1,1

The room - beautiful floor to ceiling windows, our room faced the lone Trump tower (literally, nothing near-by) which looked like it was flipping a giant golden finger to the horizon.  Kind of hilariously awesome, but you get a nice view of the strip to the side.  Plush, comfortable and very spacious rooms and I loved lounging on the sofas.

The food - Alaskan king crab leg buffet Wooooooooooooooooooo Desserts Galore Yaaaaaaaaaaaaa and awesome selection of gourmet selections including tuna ceviche\/tar tar yuuuuuuuuuuum.  Do the buffet, it's seriously worth it, even if you don't stuff your face.  I went all the way to Alaska in the middle of winter and found the king crabs to be sweeter, fresher and tastier (not to mention cheaper) in Las Vegas.  Take my word for it and save yourself some frostbites, and eat an extra crab leg for me.

The Club - had a blast at XS, loved lounging by the pool with hilariously large animal floaties and seating inside the pool, and dancing with Will.I.Am DJ-ing inside.  The crowd is, well, a little heavy with silicone and steroids, but that just makes it more fun to people watch, or what my friends describe as ""social experimentation"".

It was newer than other hotels. 2. It has two of the clubs I typically go to when I'm in Vegas. 3. They have my favorite restaurant. 4. I heard good things about this hotel. 5. It's also one of the high end hotels. 

However, I give this hotel a 2. Reasons

1. The shower had water mold ( when you don't scrub your shower pink mold starts to form) I thought to myself are you serious?! 
2. We asked house keeping to bring toothpaste and a towel. Yay they brought the toothpaste but forgot the towel. Good job house keeping for doing your job half way. On top of that when we were talking to house keeping to bring our request up they acted like we were drunk guests who just wanted those items. Not everyone that goes to Vegas gets drunk. So regardless if you assume that person is drunk don't talk to them like they are stupid. Didn't you know that the tone of your voice could be heard by the other person? 
3 . My group went to edc so we were dressed the part. It's pretty easy to get lost. When we got back to the hotel I asked one of the security where encore was. He looked at me and asked are you staying at this hotel? I mention yes I am so please direct to encore. He goes and says ""can you put something on?"" Seriously?!! The staff need to know certain events people wear different things. I should have told security "" yes I can put something on if you direct me to my hotel room where my luggage happens to be."" Not only did the security make me feel unwelcome but he did not direct me to my hotel room. 
4. I love edm however, for those people that wants to rest you will be hearing music all night.

I must say the beds are comfortable, rooms are beautiful, and the view is great. Seriously it's not worth staying here because of my experience with customer service and how disgusting the bathroom was. I do recommending staying at palazzo",3,5,3

Ours was a smoking room and you could NOT smell cigarette smoke at ALL. Encore must have quite the superior air filtration system because we had not experienced anything like it. Even my mom, a non-smoker, could not tell that ours was a smoking room.

Booked 4 months in advance for a bachelor party through www.vegas-rates.com for lower hotel rates ($365\/night for 2 queen panoramic view suite).  Upon arrival at 8pm, my reservation was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!  Apparently, multiple reservations under the same name is highly confusing to them.  What is the point of asking for my ID, address, phone number, credit card info, etc. if they could not figure out which reservation belonged to me.  After 30 minutes, they were still confused and unable to find my reservation.  My initial feeling was that I was scammed through this third party website!  The best Encore could do was charge me for a walk-in rate of $475 for a king suite and roll-out bed for the night, since queen suites were all given away, forward my info to their wholesale department to sort out, and contact me in the morning in hopes of refunding my money once my reservation was verified.  

Of course, I sent an email to www.vegas-rates.com right away and received a response from them within the hour!  Quite a relief.  They wanted to verify Encore's statement that I was able to check into my room at no additional charge.  How can Encore say that when they just charged me $475 for the night?!  I responded that that was incorrect and the third party emailed me again in a timely manner with an attachment of my reservation to show the front desk.  I showed this reservation to the front desk the following morning and the front desk was completely unable to help me.  They stated that only their whole sale department could help at this point, so I had the third party gladly forward my reservation directly to their wholesale department.  Not long after, the third party contacted me with good news stating that they squared away the details with Encore and that I should be receiving a call from Encore shortly and that I should not be charged and will be moved to the correct room type.  I did not receive a phone call from Encore whole sale and I could not wait all morning so I had to re-explain my situation to the front desk again who claimed someone was still sorting out the situation in the back and to come back in 15 minutes.  Came back in 15 minutes to re-explain my situation to another person.  It took another 10 minutes or so of going back and forth to finally get my refund of $475, but they stuck me the same king suite.  The lady printed out the receipt to show me the refunded transaction but was reluctant to give me the receipt for whatever reason.  She held it for me to verify behind the counter.  I didn't think much to ask to keep the receipt.  I was just relieved that it was finally resolved and that I could continue my plans for the rest of the bachelor party.  This whole ordeal took a good 3.5hrs of my time to resolve from about 8am-11:30am the next morning.  Luckily, everyone was still asleep by the time I finished!

Post vegas trip, I checked my credit card statement and was only refunded $399.43 instead of the full $475 as promised.  Where's the remaining $76 dollars?  I called the Wynn today to explain my situation once more and, again, they could not find my reservation (too many people with my same name)!  Was transferred to the accounting department and had to re-explain the situation again.  Was put on hold for a long time.  The lady finally found the $475 transaction and $399 refund but needed to confirm the refunded amount with her people.  I'm currently waiting for them to contact me via email or phone but I'm not confident that this issue will be resolved. 

Side note:  Horrible phone service!  I have an Iphone 4S with tmobile and could not get any reception or data.  Was very inconvenient to take the elevator 30 floors down to the lobby each time I needed to send out a text, expect a text, or make plans online.

This time we chilled and vegetated within the grounds of Encore\/Wynn and we were still kept entertained. Steve Wynn must have envisioned to build a city within a city when Encore\/Wynn were constructed.

At the pool you will see guests who are classy adults. No college kids or spring breakers type! Definitely a nice classy environment. Comfortable and padded sun chairs, complimentary chilled water, and European (topless optional) pool. The servers are always walking around making sure they are available to take your drinks order while lying by the pool.

This time round our suite was facing the strip so it was quiet. Last year, we had a pool-facing suite which was also on the same side as XS nightclub and could hear the music thumping from the room.

I finally stayed here during my most recent trip to Vegas.  Prices were decently priced for the summer so that was a plus to begin with.  The hotel is beautiful as always.  One of my reasons for staying here was to make it easier for me to go to Encore Beach Club and XS.  Both are a must!

However, I do have some complaints about the place.

1. I booked the room through hotels.com and EVERYTHING (including resort fees) was prepaid prior to my visit.  Upon checking out using the most convenient TV I was being billed for the resort fee AGAIN!  I called the front desk and said that the resort fee is usually after the stay not before it.  I did ask while checking in that my resort fee was already paid for and they said yeah it was paid for.  So tell me why am I paying again?  There has to be a system where they are able to tell if guests have already paid for the resort fee.

2. I know pillows aren't changed as every guest checks out, but housekeeping needs to do a better job in making sure the pillows are fluffed up.  I woke up with my neck hurting.  

3. As I said in #1, I checked out through the TV before noon.  My friends and I were checking the room again if we've forgotten anything and 11:59 housekeeping is knocking on the door getting ready to clean.  Sheesh, no joke!  No leeway time for us to leave.  It was a just a little strange to me because I've never had housekeeping be out the door at noon. 



When I went home I called Wynn\/Encore and told them I was doubled charged for the resort fee and I was given a refund on the spot.  So, yes, the issue was fixed without issues.  


WIth my gripes, I still love they Wynn Resort and would love to come stay here again.",2,0,1

What was once an elegant and serene hotel has been completely overrun with trash.  During my 30 minute wait to check in, drunk revelers from the Encore Beach Club wandered into the lobby and vomited on the floor.  Shortly after, a pair of tacky girls got into a loud shouting match.  I felt like I was checking into Circus Circus.

Then, at 4am, some drunk girl started banging on the door across the hall, screaming about her phone for 30 minutes.  And then she proceeded to repeat the performance every 20 minutes for the next 3.5 hours.  I called security twice, but to no avail.  I gave up trying to sleep at 5am.  The hotel was nice enough to switch my room the next evening as those guests were going to be there for several more days.

On weekend nights, traveling between the Encore and the Wynn is nigh impossible, as a gauntlet of AXE body spray-scented douchebags clog the hallway, hoping to be granted access to the XS nightclub.

Rooms are starting to show their age and are getting a little shabby, with broken curtains and unresponsive buttons on the light controllers.  Maid service is not very thorough.  My husband put on one of the robes and found a previous guest's toothpaste in the pocket... do they not wash them between customers?!

With the deterioration in general service and security, coupled with the fact that this place has somehow started the attract the second rate Jersey Shore crowd, I will not be returning.",16,14,1

First thing that you'll notice about the Encore is the RED red decor, which i love (it is my favorite color). The hotel staff were extremely polite and friendly. Encore definitely has a different feel from other hotels (i've stayed at excalibur and luxor before) in that it's not overly crowded with drunks and crazy slot machine players, they are always playing some sort of swanky music and u just feel a bit more sophisticated and mature? I really like that there's a connecting walkway between encore and wynn, so during cold months like january you don't have to brave the cold to go to a different hotel (also XS, Le Reve, and some designer stores can be found in this walkway).

We stayed on the 50th something floor and the view was gorgeous especially at night when all the lights are on even though it's not exactly the view of the strip. The room itself was super nice. I had a lot of fun with the curtains and lights controller (i know i'm a dork) that is set right next to your bed. The king size bed was AWESOME to roll around in and I like that the TV swivels so that you can watch it from your bed or the living room. The bathroom is huge with a little side tv, so you can watch your favorite show while taking a bath or a dump? (hehe)

Be careful with the minibar though, it has a sensor so anything you pick up for more that 60 second (i think) they will charge automatically to your room. We also did order room service. $26 bucks for chicken tenders (including extra fees and tax). Crazy right? But totally worth it when you're buzzed and hungry at 2am :]

But overall, beautiful hotel and beautiful room!! Come stay here if you get a chance!",2,2,1

It's at the north end of the strip and has a great self-parking garage, which means we can fly in, rent a car and drive ourselves directly to the hotel.  On our last visit, we had a room on the fifth floor away from the strip and it was just perfect.  Thankfully, when we checked in we were advised that a low floor on the strip might be loud because it was over the nightclub.  Our room was delightfully peaceful.  

We used the workout facilities which were great and had lots of treadmills, bicycles and some other sort of elliptical trainer, as well as free weights.  Even if you don't have a spa treatment, go check out that floor of the hotel.  It's amazing!  It looks like a movie set, so beautiful.

-The service was subpar (I came on a promotion that they sent me - when I checked out, they gave me a bill that was 400 dollars more than it should have been and the front desk person was not nice about it at all - finally after about 10 minutes the manager came and took care of it)

Surprisingly no problems with the room or the floor. No crazy idiots running around. At least on my floor. The sheriff showed up to the one above me and I could hear the activity but it was over quickly. This time someone sounded mentally ill or in drugs which does happen. Can't blame the hotel but it appears this time it was taken care of quicker.

Sadly I'm 3 starring you. Went to the spa and spent $300 on a massage. Therapist was barely average. And the washing machine next door was off balance and literally was slamming the wall during most of my massage. You'd think someone would plan for this. Apparently not Wynn. It went through two full wash and rinse cycles before someone stopped it. Plus someone walked in during the middle of my massage. Unprofessional and inexcusable.   I think the reputation for

The staff were very responsive and everyone from the sundries shop clerk, wait staff, and housekeepers addressed us by name. There are two sizable pool areas - my only complaint for the stay was that the pool service was really lacking. It took a long time for anyone to come by, and longer to return with a drink menu. We eventually swam up to the pool bar to help ourselves because the waitress never returned. The hotel is clean and well-appointed.

I love the red chandlers. It has a very new age burlesque feel to it.  

The rooms were nice with an awesome view, but not that much different from the Wynn. The major difference was the use of textures. Everywhere!
I loved the imitation crocodile on the walls of the elevators. 

I met one friendly bartender at the East side bar, I forgot her name. And there was a blonde cocktail waitress at the restaurant\/lounge by the elevators, I think her name was Shantal or something close to that. Those girls were awesome! So helpful, fun to talk to and really earned their tips. 

That is where the good review stops. 

The Sushi restaurant inside was good, but not worth the wait. 
It took over an hour for sushi! And it was not even that busy. 
The water glasses are tiny and you have to keep asking for more water! 
Hello its Vegas, pretty much everyone is hung over and needs water!

The service as a whole in the casino was slow.

The Encore is stunningly beautiful.  So glad we ended up staying here.  From the moment we checked in, with a very helpful and friendly registration staff (who apologizes and thanks every guest for being patient as almost every hotel in Vegas takes forever to check in) to the next morning when we left - our stay was enjoyable.  

Rooms: Huge. Modern
Beds: Comfortable
Tech: iPod docks.  Light, privacy and curtain control bedside, as well as by front door.
Bathrooms: TV in mirror.  Spacious.  Tub and shower stall.  No jacuzzi tub though.
Pool:  Two of them.  One adult ""european style"" that allows topless bathing for women, which has a swim up bar.  Another closer to the main hotel with lounge chairs partly submerged in the pool.  Beautiful gardens area surrounding the pool, too. 
Casino: Easy to make your way around and not a crazy confusing maze like most other Vegas hotels.
Bar casino-side - Eastside Lounge:  Live music nightly wed-sat, expensive, but great drinks.  If you get a table, 2 drink minimum.  No food served.  Ray makes an amazing Milagro Margarita (it'll set you back $15).  

One downside: 
As most casinos allow smoking, this is no exception.  Unfortunately, there are not smoking areas here, and rather patrons can basically smoke anywhere.  Which leaves you smelling like smoke and basically the whole casino floor can be smoky.  Not fun. 

Otherwise, a great experience and would absolutely come back soon.",3,0,2

They are beautiful and quiet and they rarely have families or children there.  The casinos are large and open and lovely.  
The rooms are large and beautiful and the hotel staff is amazing.  From the front desk to the concierge to the cleaning people, exceptional. 
From the second you check in they call you by your name, and when you need something at the room they are on it. 
I like that the hotels are at the other end of the strip from places like the MGM which has gone so far down hill and hosts so many children than I can barely stand to go there anymore, even to the casino. 
The casions at Wynn and Encore have such a great filtration system that you never smell the smoke at all.
They have great restaurants, great booze, wine and weight staff including the cocktail waitresses. 
I agree with some of the other reviews that they could use a few more tables for gambling, like Pai Gow, but I think as they become more popular and the economy rises they will do this. 
The other thing we dont like is the resort fee and that the resort fee does not include using some of the facilities like the weight room and the spa area.  To me if I pay the resort fee than it should give me the priveledge of these areas.  Otherwise you should either up the price of the room or end the resort fee all together, its just obnoxious. 
Its nice that they comped us our meals because we spent so much time at the tables gambling and they were super nice about it all.  
So all in all we always have a great experience at these two hotels.  It can be pricey if you go at high times but sometimes you can get some pretty good deals.  
I highly recommend staying in these two resorts.",0,0,0

Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various restaurants and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property.

A recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn.

With 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all.

Room accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better.

The casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival.

On the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/tryst-nightclub-las-vegas-2) but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit.

Folks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sinatra-las-vegas) and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/andreas-las-vegas). Wazuzu (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/wazuzu-las-vegas) is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5) but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality.

Lastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act.

While I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",10,1,7

Its nice to be greeted as a guest and treated with respect. 

I hadn't been here in over a year, but the hotel remains as elegant as I remember. First of all, it smells delightful and is extremely well maintained. Everyone in the hotel was cordial, helpful and super friendly. The staff seems happy to be there and makes your experience something to write about!

When leaving, the valet is a bit of a walk from the front door, but its ok, once you get there to pick up your car, there is a nice air conditioned waiting room. But, the valet is so efficient, I barely had to wait more than 5 minutes, thank you! They deserve a nice tip for being so fast.

To add to a previous review our check in process this time was awesome. Johnny checked us in and was really accomodating to our needs.

We also got $50 per room resort credit and information about XS.

The attention to detail is beyond compare... the cleanliness and style is unmatched.  I still can't figure out how all of the beautiful carpets are immaculate given the heavy foot traffic... unless they just steamed them before we arrived.  The lady at the check-in was extremely sweet, easy to talk to and helpful.  We even upgraded our room to a panoramic suite on the 60th floor... totally worth the view!  When you come in the room for the first time, the lights fade on and the automated curtains open... such a dramatic welcome... I'm pretty sure either side of the tower has sweet views; we opted for the Strip view.  You can watch the volcano at the Mirage from our vantage point!  Very impressive.  Loved how solid and heavy the doors were... you feel like you are in a multi-million dollar mansion with how solid the construction is.  Wish there was a Keurig in the rooms, but at least the coffee at the cafe in the Wynn casino more than fulfilled my coffee fix.  The atmosphere was quiet, serene and upscale.  I liked the private elevator to the spa and pool... nothing more awful than walking through a crowded casino in your swimsuit \/ cover up.  The pool at the Encore was beautiful.  Not sure why the staff couldn't just let you sit on the rounded sofa looking seats at the ends of the pool, given that no one ever was ever on them in the hours I was there.  They made a production of asking people to move and put down reserved signs... how bout let people enjoy them until those who ""reserve"" them come?  Felt a tad snobby to me.  The waitresses over the two days were hit or miss... though I must say I really loved Bianca... she was sweet, friendly and I wished she could have been my waitress for every drink I purchased!  $16+ for a drink was a little much; but whatever, it's Vegas, right?  :)

The only downside I would say for this hotel is that many times, you do feel judged if you aren't dressed up.  Not by everyone... certainly not by the sweet check-in lady or Bianca at the pool, but many of the employees do seem to give you a disapproving once over look if you are wearing casual t-shirts and shorts.  Not everyone who is wealthy likes to dress up, at least not many them in Seattle, so it's a little frustrating with all of the dress codes for the restaurants, clubs, bars, etc.  It seemed like the security folks would watch you just a little more closely if you were wearing t-shirts or athleticwear... I don't think I was perceiving that wrong.

Le Reve was spectacular... the athleticism and artistry were mind-blowing.  I think I gained 5 pounds eating at The Buffet for lunch two days in a row (their desserts are literally to die for!)  This is the only Vegas hotel I will ever stay at again, and the next time I will be sure to indulge in the spa.

After a long day at the conference I headed up to my room around 10:30pm. I had to get up early the next morning for the last day of the conference. When I got to my room the key(s) would not work to unlock the door.  I tried for several minutes then headed down to the front desk. I waited in line and a nice young man I think his name was Adam assisted me. He gave me two new keys and told me those should work. I went back up to the room, and nothing. They didn't work. I went back down for a second time, waited in line and Adam assisted me again. He gave me another set of new keys, and told me if they didn't work, it is a problem with the lock itself and that he would send security up and that they would already be up there by the time I got to my room. I went back up and the second new set of keys didn't work. I went over to the elevators and called security myself. They came and two different security personal tried to get me in my room and they couldn't. They informed me that it is the lock itself and they will have to send the locksmith. The locksmith came and within minutes opened my door. After all of this back and forth, it was midnight. It took an hour and a half to get in my room. One security guard said that this was unacceptable and went on his way. The next morning,  I made it a point to check out with the front desk and let them know about the situation last night.

Every employee I had contact with was happy, and each was very anxious to be of help.
We took advantage of a special summer offer, and were actually surprised how many visitors were on the strip that time of year.   I was happy we could get away from the crowd at Encore. There were at least double the number of people wandering around Wynn, while Encore was a bit of an escape. The crowds were even more thick at Bellagio where we could hardly get through their garden display.  There were long lines to go through the ""water tunnel"" at the garden, so we gave up since there was so much pushing and crowing.  We went to a show at ""Flamingo"" where I could hardly breath walking through the casino, the smoke was so thick.

We stayed here 2 nights on a $99 red card rate which is a great value.  They put us in the Tower Suites, but as far as I could tell the only advantage was a separate chek-in area, and your key gets you a free cup of coffee in the lobby bar.

Since we drove in from Los Angeles, we appreciated the short walking distance between the self parking and the check-in desk. You immediately get the feeling of being at a premiere hotel rather than the typical Vegas casino. Why? Because of the huge windows and natural light Encore utilizes around the casino and restaurant areas. I've noticed that majority of the other hotel\/casinos deny guests of natural lighting in (and around) the casino. This is one of the unique differences you will notice.
When it came to the service (check-in, casino, waitresses, cafe, restaurants, housekeeping, buffet, and Le Reve staff), everyone was friendly and professional. For this caliber of hotel, I got the excellent service that I expected. Since I'm not a whale, I didn't expect whale treatment.

The staff was nice and the dealers and the cocktail girls were very pleasant as well. The reason for the four star review is actually two reasons.

 

1) When we asked for an upgrade upon arrival, they offered us a Panoramic View room at a ""promotion rate"". We went for it thinking that the upgrade will give us a better view from our room. Once we entered the room, the view was of a construction site and an empty huge parking lot. I do not consider this an upgrade, but rather the opposite. I didn't want to switch rooms as I was there not to stare outside the window and just wanted to get to enjoying Vegas. However, I did feel that we were taken for fools and were privately laughed at once we left the check in counter. This is definitely not something I would expect from Wynn. My advice is ask them specifically what the room view is and check the room first before telling them to bring up your luggage.

 

2) Having paid $300 per night, you would expect that you would get certain perks for being a valued guest of the hotel. My specific issue is going to a night club. We got bottle service the first night and it was a painless experience. However, the second night around, we wanted to stop by a different club for an hour or two of dancing and drinking and then head on to gamble for the rest of the night. I noticed from the night before that there was a line to get in to the club unless you were on a guest list or got bottle service. I went to the concierge to ask them to put us on a guest list to skip the line. The concierge told us there is a fee per person. The men are $55 and women a bit less. This was a big surprise for me.  Again, having paid a premium for the room, I would think that I would get the privilege of being able to enter the club without having to wait in line with people coming from other hotels who paid half the price for their rooms.  Apparently that's not the case which was very disappointing.

 

Everything else on the other hand was excellent. The food was great as usual, the pool grounds were clean, and the hotel still maintains a great appearance.",0,0,0

At the Encore, prices are just as ridiculous as any other hotel on the strip. The thing I love about it is the convenience and laziness of it all. There's just something about sitting on my ass in my hotel room and hearing *knock knock* 'room service.' I equate it to having pizza delivered to your house, except you're in a hotel room during an adventurous trip instead of merely in your house.  

The food was standard, nothing special. I got mini sliders and a French onion soup. I've had better. Wasn't terrible, just nothing spectacular. My wife had a sandwich and fries. 

The guy who delivered it was nice enough (making the usual chit chat, where are you guys from and so on). Gave him his tip and he was on his way.

Yes, there are a myriad of fancy suites available to those who will pay or who gamble enormous sums, but for most, a standard ""deluxe"" room - though they're usually quite nice- is the way we roll. For now, at least, the Encore is offering such excellent rates (we got the weekend of a huge conference for $139\/nt) that it's beyond anything else I've experienced. The hotel itself is richly decorated in reds, black, golds. Everything is sumptuous yet, somehow, classy. It's airy, much more so than the Wynn or Bellagio, and has stunning, though understated, grounds. The casino isn't large, but I didn't have trouble finding penny machines, $10 blackjack tables, and even a few other lower-priced games. The rooms, which are all suites, were more luxe than the Wynn with large comfortable beds, modern decor, a second room, two flat-screen televisions, an actually comfortable and classic couch and daybed as well as the remote control curtains that are key for overcoming a Vegas morning after. The bathrooms are large and well-appointed, with soft, large robes, marble countertops and floors and a large, welll kept bathtub. The whole operation is run by extremely helpful and friendly, though not saccharine, employees. Drink service is excellent too. The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 starts is the distance from everything else. Now, I realize that it's not something that can be improved, but potential guests should be aware that it's quite a bit further than even the Wynn, and it's a good 20, 25 minutes at least to old TI.",1,2,1

You'll have to go to the Wynn (connected to hotel via nice hallway featuring high-end retail and XS nighclub) if you want to eat (there aren't a lot of choices for food @ Encore).

My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. It was a surprise bday getaway. 

I give this Hotel a solid 5++ stars mainly because everything about our stay was superb. I have to emphasize that not everything was perfect. But, what compelled me to write this review was that all of our concerns were met, attended too and it exceeded both of our expectations. 

First, we got to the room and noticed that it was one of those adjoining rooms. I personally do not like adjoining rooms. We called the front and asked to be switched in the morning. And just like that we were in our new room on a higher floor the very next morning.  They even were nice enough to hold it till 6pm since we were heading to the pool at the time they called to say our room was ready. 

Secondly, there was a huge discrepancy on our room bill. We disputed the charges accordingly and it was taken care of in the most professional and humblest manner. We felt like they really knew what they were doing and we weren't given the run around. 

The concierge was polite and inviting with great attitudes.

The pools connect also so you can check out the different pools at Encore and Wynn. Encore Beach Club is a little pool areas secluded by tall trees and has its own bar, lounges and DJ pool party.

The only con I have about this place is the crappy reception in the rooms.

Now for the verdict - I would never stay here again and I would advise anyone who asked me against. Why? THE MUSIC!!! On Monday night, the club was playing really loud techno music and it reverberated throughout the entire hotel. I was on the 21st floor and it felt like someone was beating a bass drum in the room next door. This went on until 4 am. Have you ever been at a stop light and a kid in a low rider pickup pulls up next to you with a sub woofer system that makes your windows shake and you teeth rattle? Now imagine having to stay at that stop light for the next 6 hours. Now, on top of that, imagine having to pay the kid $400+ for the privilege of listening to his thumping. It is the most asinine business philosophy I have ever seen in a city that employs some of the most innovative business practices in the world.

At the time of check-in, we had a very very nice woman that checked us in and she could not have been kinder and more attentive. We also received a beautiful room. The room is drop dead gorgeous and spacious with an amazing bed. The bathroom is absolutely beautiful and we have a small living room with a beautiful view. Yet, I wish I could choose 4 1\/2 stars. The hotel lost about half a star for the following reason: when we checked in, we were given a complimentary ticket voucher for Showstoppers, their newest show. I had explained to them that we could not go tonight as the show was at 7 PM and we had dinner at the restaurant, Jardin, at 8 PM. We were told that we could see it on Sunday. We went to the Concierge desk, which we were told to go to in order to get the complimentary ticket and purchase a second one. We waited there for 10 minutes as both of the concierge tables were occupied. When we got there, we were told that the show is no longer running tomorrow and the last night was tonight. The frustration here is that we waited so long in line to find this out where we should've never been told to try to get a complimentary ticket for Sunday by the registration desk. What's worse, for such a high caliber hotel, I would expect the concierge to do something like say 'let's offer you a complimentary ticket for another show and buy the other ticket for that show since we misinformed you as a whole and you waited in line for this'. This did not happen and therefore it was disappointing. This is why the hotel only got four stars on this review. Customer service is key. I just stayed at another hotel last night and they made a small mistake that was insignificant. I ended up getting a call from the hotel manager, never having called to complain, to offer certificates\/comps due to errors that they made. We turned down the comp as their customer service was impressive and the mistake was minor. That is what elite service is all about. For the amount that this hotel charges and for the luxury that it visually represents and therefore should also act like, I am disappointed. Therefore, beautiful hotel yet needs a better trained representation of what elite terrific service is all about when greeting people that pay a lot to stay there.

I loved the luscious red theme they had going on throughout the lobby, especially in the check-in area. Service was great too. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful- he gave us some free passes for the ladies to Blush and XS.

Minus one star for charging an extra $50 per night for a double bed room. We were told that out of the 2000+ rooms, only 200 or so are doubles, which is why they implement the charge. Boo. So we decided to pass and have them send in a roll away bed instead.

The rooms here are spacious and the bathrooms enormous! A major plus was having somewhat of a divider between the sleeping area and couch\/desk area. Since I was sharing the room and wasn't even paying for it, I opted to sleep on the roll away bed, which I had no problems with! It was definitely the largest and most comfortable roll away I've been on. Wait, it's the only one I've been on actually, haha. Plus, with the large screen TV &amp; wall divider, I felt like I was in my own separate room. Oh, and the curtains here effectively block out the sunlight. I seriously could not tell what time of day it was when I rolled out of bed hungover in the late morning.

Shopping here is amazing (Chanel, Hermes, Rock & Republic) and even their non-designer stores are pricey! There is a swimwear shop in the lobby near the pool area and I ended up blowing over $300 on a new suit because I was desperate for a change, as I had only packed one swimsuit and didn't plan on staying that extra one day in Vegas. Oh well. If you have the time and lack the funds, I'd suggest not even bothering with this store.

There are two separate pool areas at Encore- one for all guests and the other only for those over 21, since it is a topless area. This is the same pool that is part of XS nightclub. And since I'm getting lazy, please go read Mina T's review for further details on the pool area :P",2,2,2

First of all, the reception sucks! We had a huge party staying in the hotel and had a really hard time to contact each other. Some carrier might be better than the others, but as I know, my Sprint and my friend's T-Mobile both failed. 

Secondly, although the resort suite claims it has 700 - 745 square feet , I feel like it's smaller than Venetian's Bella Suite Queen Queen, which is also a 700 square-feet suite. Venetian's Bella Suite Queen Queen also has two TVs in the room and a sofa bed but Encore Resort Suite only has one TV in the room and an L shape sofa. 

Also, it is far from all the bars\/restaurants on the strip, both driving and walking would take a long time to anywhere else.

LOCATION:
They're located in the boonies on the north end of the strip, though directly across the street from the Fashion Show Mall.
 
ENTRY:
We had privilege of the VIP entrance which has a separate entry and check in\/out, located just before the main entry. Manicured gardens abound, and elegant décor adorn the reception area.
 
ROOM:  
We were in 6020.  The room is spacious and very modern.  We had great views of the neighboring Wynn, Wynn Golf Course, Fashion Show Mall, Treasure Island, Palazzo, Rio, Mirage and a sliver of Caesar's Palace.  The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were too soft for me.
 
BATHROOM:
It's very spacious, with a glass shower, soaking tub, two basins and a separate water closet.  All the usual amenities were offered.
 
CASINO:
We are not gamblers at all, but played for about an hour.  Compared to other hotels, this casino is beautifully bright, airy, and cheerful.  There are big windows that overlook the gardens.  The best experience was that the smoke level was very minimal.
 
SPA:
While we didn't partake in any treatments we did tour the gorgeous pathway leading to the spa lol!  Beautiful.  It looked like we were headed into an Asian temple.  I can only imagine what the inside looks like.
 
POOL:
We are not pool loungers but we have eyes!  The Beach Club area is swanky as hell!  Yikes.  Just gorgeous.  So is the pool outside XS.  It's nothing like a Hawaii resort but still beautiful.
 
RESTAURANTS:
I have a separate review for Zoozacrackers on their dedicated Yelp page.  
 
NIGHTCLUBS:
I have a separate review for XS on their dedicated Yelp page.
 
SHOWS:
I have a separate review for Le Reve on their dedicated Yelp page.
 
SERVICE:
Concierge was good but not great.  We phoned down to check on concert tickets that were to be dropped off.  The female associate who answered the phone was very courteous and professional, but apparently couldn't get in touch with anyone in that department, and was going to call us back.  We waited about 20 minutes before heading down to deal with it in-person because we were getting nervous.

Why, you ask?

""One of these things is not like the others,
One of these things just doesn't belong,
Can you tell which thing is not like the others
By the time I finish my song?

Did you guess which thing was not like the others?

If you guessed this [girl] is not like the others,
Then you're absolutely...right! ""

You're damn right I had a coupon to stay here. And it was a $#%#$ good one too! 

We got a promo code from my dad that upgraded us to a King Suite at  Encore in addition to free tickets to see Le Reve, a $50 dining credit, and free $25 slot play. All for what ended up being $100 a night!

Vegas on a budget brought us to one of the most fancy shmancy we-have-rolls-royces-with-customized-license-plates hotels on the strip. 

Innnteresting.

The hotel is beautiful. Gorgeous. Stunning. We were greeted by a friendly staff, checked in promptly and made our way up to a gigantic ~750 sq foot room.

It was decked out with all kinds of technology...modern decor, automatic lighting - from a mega remote near the bed - electronic blinds\/shades that open at the press of a button.

Too bad I failed miserably by pressing the ""all lights on"" instead of ""night light"" button in the middle of the night , sending a surge of what felt like rays from damn sun throughout the entire room.

Whoopsie. This is why you dont people like me, in establishments like that. That's all I gotta say.

The only reason why I didn't give Encore 5 stars was because our water temperature seemed to never quite get hot enough and the bathroom is SO large that it didn't retain the heat very well. So stepping out from a semi-warm shower into an incredibly cold room was not too pleasant, even if the complimentary robe was hanging over there - waaaay over there - on the wall.

Also: wtf is up with the toilets? Were they made for giants?! That thing is hella uncomfortable to sit on when you gotta... uhh ... sit for a prolonged period of time. 

And I'll be straight with you: yeah, I had to sit for a prolonged period of time because I got the stomach flu 2 days into being in Vegas! TMI? Well too damn bad. The toilet is so tall that only the balls of my feet  touched the floor and I felt like a need a little foot rest in front of me to be comfortable.

All in all, I spent a lot of time doing all sorts of stomach-flu-related-practices in my hotel room and was probably as comfortable as I could have imagined. The bed was huge and comfortable, the pillows and blankets were goose-down and very cloud-like, and it was very calm atmosphere in general.

Regardless if you stay here or not, you must must must see Le Reve, which is at the Wynn Theater. It was a phenomenal show and even though we did not pay for our $250 comped tickets, it is worth the price (: 

I must be honest and say that next time we may try and stay somewhere else for a change of scenary, but Encore is a beautiful place to come 'home' to!",1,3,2

Our last visit there, however, was less than enjoyable, so we decided to take advantage of an email special offer at Encore. We did realize that this particular hotel was at the far end of the action on the Strip, but we felt the price was too good to pass up and it included the buffet for two.  None of us had ever even stepped foot into either the Wynn or Encore, so we were very pleasantly surprised as soon as we walked in the front door. The front desk staff was extremely accommodating when we asked for adjoining rooms, and even though we got an extremely great price for our rooms, she upgraded us to suites with two queen beds instead of the king room we had reserved. Upon opening our door, we were astounded to see she had also given us rooms with an amazing view looking down The Strip. The room was well appointed, beautifully decorated, and the floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows left us breathless. Before we even unpacked, we turned the lights out and just sat looking out at the lights. The entire four days were fantastic. We were there mid-week, so the casino was pretty uncrowded, but we did find that the tables and machines didn't seem to be paying out much. The good part was we hardly noticed the smoke that you usually get in the Vegas casinos. The pools were closed for maintenance and the Beach Club was closed for the season, but they looked great from a distance. We all vowed to stay at The Encore whenever we go back to Las Vegas!",0,0,1

The rooms are gorgeous.  The bed is comfortable, there's a TV in the bathroom that you can watch while taking a bath, the living area is spacious...I absolutely LOVED the room.  Based on this alone, I would give the hotel five stars.  

BUT

For a room this pricey (over $250 a night on Expedia), I'd expect better sound proofing.  I could hear people's conversations while they were walking down the hallways and in adjacent rooms (even rooms above ours).  I didn't expect so much sound transfer.  Plus, you can hear XS going on all night through the window wall.  There was just a lot of noise.  The toilet in the bathroom sounded like it was exploding every time it was flushed, and you could similarly hear this through two bathroom doors into the living space.  

We were given two card keys, and one didn't work.  Also, we had trouble operating the shades and drapes.  Sometimes they worked, and sometimes they didn't and needed some fiddling.  

We were left a message saying there was a cake delivery for my birthday.  We made sure to turn off the ""privacy  button, and we waited for going on two hours and no one arrived.  The next day, we were told that our privacy light was on, which was bull, because we specifically made sure it was off.

It's still a nice hotel.  I just wish there weren't all these little glitches during our stay.",1,2,3

I received an invitation in the mail to come and stay at the Wynn for two consecutive nights and receive two complimentary buffets and two tickets to the show ""La Reve."" It was a great offer that I could not pass it up. My mom and I decided to go for Thanksgiving weekend last year.

The hotel is beautiful and lavish. It is a gaming casino, but there are sections of the resort that do not feel that way. We got a room at the Encore with a queen bed. We pulled into the valet area where we were quickly attended to. Given the fact that it was a holiday weekend, checking in wasn't as quickly as one would anticipate. This is completely understandable.


Our room was clean and beautiful. You really feel luxurious when walking into it. The bathroom was one of my favorite things about it. The separate soaking tub and dual sinks is a great touch. Plus, there is a TV in there so you can watch while taking a bath or doing your makeup. 

The separate sitting area with the revolving plasma TV is also very convenient. No complaints about the room whatsoever.

The show was also amazing. We watched in awe as these performers catapulted themselves into someone else's arms over a pool of water. All the stunts were incredible and above all, the show was free which made it even better.

I received another invitation from the Wynn to stay during their winter season, but this one does not include tickets to the show. I will definitely be coming back here when in Vegas.",8,3,3

PARKING: You MUST pay for parking now (upwards of $15 for 24 hours). Pro tip: Wynn and Encore have SEPARATE garages which can be convenient if you park in the one closest to you.

CHECK IN: Professional in demeanor at the Front Desk, the agent made the effort to engage in small talk and seemed to be a smooth process. One unique thing they do is they automatically sign you up for a players card when you check in and your room key serves as your players card as well......I guess thats one way to get as many people as possible signed up for the players card isnt it?

SUITE: As soon as i walked in the drapes opened and the TV turned on with a welcome message on the screen, the room was already noticeably cooled down too (most hotels the rooms are stuffy when you walk in). The decor of the room was COMPLETELY different than what you see in the casino, but it certainly felt luxurious. Was it worth that high of a price tag?....well lets just say they are No Mandarin Oriental.

BUFFET: The food here is delicious, and the price is a little less than Bacchanal at Caesars but still steep for a buffet. No complaints about the food.

POOL: Again Wynn and Encore have separate pools, both very serene and a perfect temperature. I didnt have trouble finding a chair.

CASINO: The casino is full of Reds, Whites and purple colors and butterflies, a little over the top?....maybe....but they often play Frank Sinatra which i absolutely love. Oh...and in an effort to keep the ""riff raff"" out, even if you play a machine at the sports bar you still pay for your drink- no comp drinks here....just FYI.

Its an upscale place, You should already know how Steve Wynn does hotels.

This was my first time staying at Encore, and I WILL be coming back. It was my boo's 30th birthday and I wanted to stay in an ultra-chic \/ semi-fancy \/ elite hotel. Through alllll my research I found Encore to be the most affordable for how nice it was. After looking through all these travel sites, I called Encore and spoke with a rep. who actually offered me a lower price per night (and I didn't even mention what the prices I saw were!).

Checking in -- long line, but speedy service. They offer you upgrades, and give you the dl on resort fees, etc. Also, check in was @ 3P & we got there are 1P, they let us check in early... woot!

Room -- we stayed in the Resort King Suite which was AMAZING! I even did research & looked at some YouTube videos (thats what sold me, but the rooms are even better in person) http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PWx46XrpFAk - this is the video I watched. HUGE rooms, spacious, big bathrooms, super modern with buttons next to the bed that open & close sheers & curtains & lights. Doorbells for the rooms too, or set your light outside to ""private"" which lets the staff know to not bother, and disables the doorbell.

Staff -- beyond helpful. Everyone says hello to you! Going up to your room has a little security\/check in where you have to show them your key-card, it's annoying but I understand why they do it. Bell-boys are efficient and valet is super speedy!

Hotel Perks & Venues - XS, Surrender, Encore Beach Club, Resort Pool, Imaculate Spa area.... this place has it all. The casino itself wasn't too busy which was nice. The grounds are gorgeous and rest assure that this hotel is spotless! The pool area is spacious and has lots of chairs if you decide to go to the Resort Pool.... also, there are lots of girls to tend too your drink needs & there is complimentary water at the pool. (They give you each 2 towels as well)  You will find families at the pool, the beach club is definitely for the younger crowd... but get on the GL unless you want to pay. The ""resort fee"" supposedly pays for free wi-fi... my phone was connected but connected to nothing. You've been warned!

Overall my experience was amazing. Apologies for the LONG review, I suppose there aren't enough words to describe how amazing this place is. Note: if you're not in an executive suite there is a $25 daily resort fee... also remember to add in tax too!",6,1,2

The check-in was fast and friendly.  For an additional $25, I was upgraded to the Panoramic Suites, mine on the 61st floor.  I'd been up there before and my room really just looked into the side of the Wynn, but this room was more on the west end and looked right down the strip!  Incredible view!!!

I come to Vegas once a month and the view and excitement never gets old.  My room was as clean and fresh as the day they opened.  Everything in the Encore\/Wynn is just first rate.  So why only 4 stars?

I unwind a bit after my meetings by playing some video-poker, I play $5\/hand and I play fast.  I was surprised that Wynn\/Encore policy prohibits comping drinks at the bar.  I could move to the casino-area and play the same amount and be comped, but then I couldn't see the games on TV.  So I got in a cab and went to the Hard Rock to play for a few hours.

The only other ""gripe"" I have about the Encore is that when you go to use the on-screen check-out, it asks if you'd like a copy of the folio sent to your e-mail... I checked yes and then all the letters came up and expected me to type in my e-mail (which is rather lengthy) on the screen using the remote.  So... I went downstairs to checkout and was only behind a couple people, so no big deal... but would be at prime-time checkout time on a weekend. They already have my e-mail on file, as they sent my reservation confirmation that way and a survey e-mail after I left... you'd think they could connect the two.

They run a first class joint.  My room-service breakfast was incredible.  The whole drink ""thing"" probably costs them some business, but I suppose there's a good reason for it.  Both properties were lively and fun. I'll easily stay again, but my video-poker money goes eleswhere.",0,0,0

However, i still hold the palazzo as my #1 hotel in vegas. The encore had all the big items down- awesome decor, great pool scene, excellent service. However it was the details where this place does not get my elusive #1 spot. 

Exhibit A- Air conditioning. The air conditioning in our room was strange. We set it to 70 degrees- yet it still felt warm. There was definitely air blowing, but it just wasnt cold air. We switched it to as low as it would go and still no temperature change. 

Exhibit B- I really like having a coffee bean or starbucks located somewhere in the casino floor so that when I wake up, i can grab something familiar and quick. There is nothing of the sort at Encore, and their only breakfast place is a BAR that they hang up coffee signs behind. Nothing like staring at a large bottle of grey goose 1st thing in the morning after a long night in vegas. Perhaps im just spoiled by the Coffee Bean at Palazzo ,but you know what? I love that coffee bean!

Exhibit C- Small gaming floor. Not an issue for those of us who dont like to gamble, but if you do i suggest you go elsewhere. 

Exhibit D-  The mini Bar. I brought along a slice of birthday cake to enjoy with me during my stay in vegas. Since the entire mini fridge in the room is occupied with overpriced adult beverages, I had the genius idea to remove them and put my cake in their place. Big mistake. Apparently if the items are removed from the bar for longer than 60 seconds a trigger senses this and you are charged. Luckily the front desk believed me when i told them i was just trying to make room for my cake otherwise that would've been quite a hefty mini bar charge. To their credit, there is a big sign that states this 60 second rule, i just was not paying attention .Its still an annoying rule though.

Some of the good things about this hotel is the amazingly friendly staff. Everybody from Housekeeping to room service to front desk had a smile on their face and seemed to be happy to do their job . 

The decor of this hotel was unqiue and enjoyable. I liked the pools layout and how both the wynn and encore were connected by some very nice shops.

We loved the Encore resort room, with its separate seating\/living room area.  We were lucky enough to get a strip view on the 12th floor.  Even though we were on a lower floor the view was still spectacular.

The pools at Encore were also great.  We were at the regular resort pool the first day, but went to the European\/Adult only pool the second and third days to get away from the kids splashing and playing in the resort pool.

The service at the hotel is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Everybody was very polite and helpful.  They made the stay that much more relaxing.

I think we may have started a new family tradition!!  I have had the most wonderful, pampered time staying here.  From the moment you walk into their Hotel your senses are aroused by this beautiful fragrant air. 

We stayed in suite 6235 with a panoramic view of the Northern part of The Strip. You walk into the Foyer... there is a Foyer!  The HUGE bathroom has a toilet closet, dual sinks, a lighted magnifying mirror, super large tub and a glass enclosed shower.  2 comfy and soft bathrobes, a weight scale, hair dryer and the best smelling bath wash, conditioner and shampoo.  There is also a large closet with drawers in the closet of the hallway.  The windows were floor to ceiling in the livingroom area.  The livingroom also had floor to ceiling mirrors and a comfy couch with an attached chaise lounge.   There was a big screen tv in the room divider that swiveled into the bedroom area.  The bed was large, the mattress (which you can buy) was so comfy, plenty of pillows and a comforter\/duvet.  On the side table there was a console where you can control the lights, the blackout shades for the panoramic view and the sheer curtains as well. 

Staff was very nice and so good!!  One gentleman had pressed the elevator door for us and held it... he just saw us walking down the hallway.  He didnt ride with us, he just called the elevator and waited.  Very cool!  

We toured the resort but the pool was closed for the season.  The Spa looked great.  One of the clubs had a line and from teh looks of it it looked like Prom.  They looked so young! haha  

I played slot machines and I had won and then stopped.  I used our room card to gained points and I received a free buffet!  (WHICH WAS JUST AS AWESOME!!!!!!!)  

The location was towards the end of The Strip.  but it made it easy for when you take a cab back to the hotel by not using The Strip.  It was also across from Fashion Show mall, so we were able to join in the frenzy of Midnight shopping Thanksgiving night.  Didn't buy anything because why bother spending money on shopping for Christmas gift and not use it for fun in Vegas!

I've been to Vegas many times and have stayed at so-so hotels and really nice upscale hotels.  Every hotel I've stayed at on the strip such as Mandalay Bay, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, and MGM, have exceeded my expectations.  I was really hoping to be Wow'ed by this place as well.
The wow factor began to diminish the moment I got out of my car at The Wynn self-park garage.  It was unclear when I got out of the elevator if I was at The Wynn or at Encore, and even more confusing to find the Check-In counter.  Luckily we were guided by a helpful person in the hall who saw me looking around all confused.  He directed us to go straight ahead and around the wall of the pool area, and as soon as we got there, it was quite obvious  where to check in as there was a long line.  I was actually surprised at how long the line was, considering I've never experienced this at other hotels in Vegas. I had reserved a King Resort Suite and was offered an upgrade to a Panoramic View suite for just $20 more a night.  I was told the view would be amazing, expecially at sunset, so I gladly accepted the upgrade offer.   
We got to our room on the 50th floor, and it was beautifully decorated and I loved the layout, but the view didn't impress me much.  I guess in the hotel's defense, it's just a view of Vegas, nothing too breathtaking to look at, it's not like there is an ocean or anything.  BUT.. I did feel a little insulted that she thought I would appreciate the sunset from a north east facing room.  The sun doesn't set on that side!  I let that go since I was so happy to be in our beautiful suite and didn't need to be at my aunt's wedding til 6:00pm and it was only like 2:45 so I put on my swimming trunks and sun screen and went down to the pool.. the European pool, where it's okay to be topless.  There were no topless ladies there which was okay with me cuz that's not my thing, but I liked the idea of being at a pool where there's no children peeing in the pool and running all over the place making me spill my drink.  
The pool was quite nice but a little on the crowded side and there wasn't much sunlight so I guess I could have saved on the sunscreen.
I got back to my room a little after 4:00 to get all prettied up for my aunt's wedding, I popped my keycard in the door and..... nothing.  So I did it again.. still nothing.. uggh, I only had ONE mojito!  Why is this happening?!?!    I tried several times but still no luck so I called my friend who was still down at the pool, just hoping that his key card would work and that he wouldn't think I'm a total idiot for not knowing how to work my key card.   Well, when he tried his.. same thing, nada!  At this point I'm getting a little worried because I really didn't want to be late to the wedding, cuz that's always awkward to walk in behind the bride.  
I really didn't want to make a trip all the way down to the front counter (I'd have to look all over for it again and probably wait in line) but luckily there was a courtesy phone by the elevator.  The operator said she'd send someone right up.  This person she sent took awhile to get there, and it was a security guy.  He checked my ID, then tried his own card (as if the two of us couldn't figure out how to use our cards), he tried a few times only to come to the conclusion ""Yup, it's dead""  so he called maintenance and assured me someone would be right up.  We waited about 20 mins, then I went down to talk to someone who's answer was ""let me talk to the manager about an upgrade""  I'm like ""what?!?!  I don't want an upgrade, I just want back in my room""  I couldn't tell him that though because he ran off so fast, also the thought of an upgrade was kinda nice.  He came back a few minutes later to tell me he'd send someone right up.  Long story short, 45 minutes after that, we were finally back in our room and the maintenance guy explained he's the only guy working maintenance on both properties.. he got my sympathy vote, but seriously, it was time for me to be at the wedding already and I hadn't even showered (the wedding was in North Vegas, about a 15-20 minute drive).
I ended up skipping the wedding, and felt pretty bad about it but of course I made the most of it since it is Vegas and there is so much to do.
To sum up my experience here: The room was nice and the bed REALLY comfortable, the pool was nice but not as nice as Mandalay or even MGM, and the service was disappointing, I mean, I'm sure hotel room card readers malfunction or ""die"" from time to time but there should have been more of an effort on the hotel's part to either minimize the inconvenience or even at the very least try to make it up to me (I never got that free upgrade nor did I even get a sincere apology). But then again, maybe I didn't seem upset enough. It's hard to be upset in Vegas. And with that thought, I cannot wait til my next trip to Vegas, but I will not be staying at this hotel.",0,1,1

We arrived around 9pm and the hostess informed us there is a 2-drink minimum requirement for their lounge due to the live entertainment (duo piano).  We acknowledged and ordered our two drinks minimum for the show.  There were 5 of us.  It was not until the next morning, I noticed that we were charged 18% tax on our drinks.  I talked to one of the waitresses working the afternoon of June 26.  She informed me that there is a live entertainment tax of 10%.  I asked her why we were not informed of the live entertainment tax.  She opened their cocktail menu and pointed to the fine prints on the bottom of the cocktail lists among other tax, charge info and said, it's printed there.  The lounge was dark with candle lights.  We barely could see the cocktail list and descriptions.  These fine prints of the live entertainment tax  information is 3 to 5 times smaller font than their cocktail list.  I feel deceived and manipulated.  

First of all, the fine prints are too small for a normal human being to see with their candle lounge lighting in the evening.

Second, they did not list the live entertainment tax separate from the sales tax.  I was misled into beliving our sales tax total was the amount shown.  After the scotch and whiskies, we just doubled the total tax amount for tip assuming the tax was 9%.  We ended up paying a 36% tip.  

When I talked to the waitress, she informed me that there's nothing she could do, I signed.  I asked to speak with a manager and she told me that the manager is in a meeting and will not be available for another 30-45 minutes.  She informed me that I can wait if I want to but most likely the manager will give me the same response, ""there's nothing they can do because I signed"".  

I feel my consumer right has been violated.  Is it legal for businesses to take advantage of their consumers using fine prints and their condition after they feed us alcohol?  I have always had positive experience at luxury resorts like Bellagio, Venetian, Plazzo, Wynn and especially Encore until now.  It's extremely disappointing that Encore\/East Side Lounge would pull the fine-print\/maniplation tactic to profit more from their customers.  

So for those of you who are planning to enjoy Encore's East Side Lounge for their live entertainment, please be aware of the live entertainment tax.  We had a great time at the lounge and enjoyed the duo piano show a lot until I found out the next day we were overcharged.  I wouldn't mind paying for the live entertainment at all especially when it was very good.  I just do not appreciate being deceived or manipulated into paying more.  

Oh well, I hope I'll learn from this experience and always verify my bills before signing even if it requires me to sober up a bit.",4,0,0

I had an awesome suite on a top floor for the weekend and the staff was great and attentive.  The rooms are beautiful. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars because I felt that the crowd is definitely more ""mature"". and I was disappointed with food options. Younger people come for Encore beach Club but generally speaking the clientele is much older. 

Also drinks were ridiculously expensive. My average drink was $18-$20 dollars. Food selection was ok - both on site and room service. I had room service for breakfast the first morning and I was very unimpressed. Eggs Benedict was $32 and when it arrived, it was definitely lacking in portion size and taste. Mind you when you've been drinking all day or plan to drink all day -- food is critical! I just opted for a bottle of champagne instead :)  The restaurants were nice, food wasn't spectacular.  

I did enjoy the pool area, but it was mostly couples and older folk. The EBC pool on the other hand was a blast, as always! They had a nice give away with free bikinis and temporary tattoos. Actually, I would like to give a shout out to the guys who work at XS, EBC and Surrender, very nice and accommodating. Stellar service there. 

The gambling is  expensive ($25 minimum tables) with not so many tables. I'm not an experienced gambler and I was hoping to try it out, but this is definitely not the place to learn. 

Would I stay here again? Maybe. Nice spacious rooms, good views, but small compared to most other hotels.  Service is great.  4.5 stars would be more accurate.

Gosh, what can I say that was not already said a thousand times? This place is gorgeous. The design, the colors, the style, service, yada, yada, yada. I'll talk about some of the subtle things I liked and didn't like instead.

Did anyone mention the heated floor in the bathroom so when you get up to use the bathroom 6-7 times in the wee hours cause you drank wayy too much partying at the...sorry lost track of the intent here. Anyway, the bathroom floors are heated. What about the very functional closet lights? Or that the bathrooms have separate showers and bathtubs, or that the bed and pillows are so damn comfortable, or that the phone on the desk has your name on it? What about the remote lighting, curtain thingy by the bed?. Anyway all nice touches and worthy of five stars.

The little nitpicking things that I have to mention just because. The room door locks funny. I mean, it is not a conventional door knob with a lock. It is a straight bar shaped handle that has no additional knob for locking. Instead, you have to raise it to a 2 o'clock postion to lock the door. I forgot to do this my first night and the housekeepers came in the room in the afternoon.  yeah, don't forget to lock the door correctly and press the ""privacy"" button even if you're stupidly drunk. That reminds me, on the second night, I made sure to press the privacy button and lock the door, but the housekeeper still tried to come in the next day. When I checked, the ""Privacy"" button was off. Oh and the wait for checking in was rather long. I would say I waited in line for about 20 minutes before I could check-in. 

So all-in-all, I say 4.75 stars. The door lock probs I had were probably my fault. But the check in time was kind of long. Hmm, other than that, I can't think of anything else to nitpick.",3,1,1

We stayed there Tuesday 6\/24\/17 to Sunday 6\/25\/17. We had never stayed there but the reviews online seemed overwhelmingly positive and we figured a 5 star rating had to mean that the customer service would be excellent.

On Saturday morning I went to the booth about 9am to tell them I was done playing and that I was ready to see a host. They called the front desk or the host desk or someone and then told me I was scheduled to not check out until Sunday and that my assigned host was Jenny and that she was off that day. I told her we were checking out that day and she said no the hotel had us staying until Sunday. I asked her to double check she had the right name and she said it was the correct guest. I told her our flight was that day and she insisted we were booked through Sunday. I told her I would have to adjust my flights and she said to do that and come back the next morning. I did that and we paid the extra money to change our flights.

Fast forward to 2:30 in the afternoon. Housekeeping came to our room and asked if we were checking out. I told them no we were staying. 5-10 minutes later the front desk was calling saying we needed to check out 2 hours ago. This disturbed me, we should have been in the air at that time and the only reason we were not is because we were told we were scheduled to stay. They asked me if thy could move our room because they needed the room for someone else. I told them that we could do that. Minutes later the front desk attendant shows up st my door with the credit card imprint machine. I didn't understand why we were being charged extra when they were making the mistake. I asked to speak to a manager.While waiting I received a call from a vegas number 702.770.7000 which turns out is the Wynn's contact number, and I answered it. The gentleman's name was Fernando Sandoval and he introduced himself as a casino host who had taken care of my room charges for the previous nights.m I explained why I was currently perturbed and what had transpired at the red card desk and now with the room. He assured me that he would take care of it and call the Encore manager who still had not come out to talk to me. The manager came out a few minutes later and apologized and said everything was fine. Fernando texted me so I had his mobile which was different than the number he called me from despite him telling me he was at home and wasn't working until 6pm. Odd that when he first called it was from a Wynn landline. Not enough to set my alarm bells off yet but definitely an interesting inconsistency. I was given new room keys but assured that the new room was identical. The floor plan was the same but the amenities and services were not as we were no longer in the Tower Suites. 
Around 1045ish fernando found us in the casino. He was very personable and talked to us about 10-15 minutes. He told us again he was sorry for the mixup and that he had taken care of the room food and beverage for the trip. He also offered us very enticing comps for future trips. His promises were as follows:
1.  Our rooms for this and future trips.
2. Discounted host level nightly room rates for any other guests we would like to bring to Wynn.
3. Our food and beverage (within reasonable limits) for my wife and myself for this and future trips (provided we maintain a good play rating). Obviously guests would pay for their own and their play would determine any comps for them.
4. Free entrance to the clubs for my wife and myself. Tables and bottle service would be at some cost to us.
5. Limo service to and from the airport for future trips.
6. VIP check in and access to the RFB invited guests lounge.
7. To deal directly with Fernando so as to ""cut out any middleman"" or misunderstanding.
8. That they had not followed up on the misunderstanding but that they would. This was particularly important to my wife as she was concerned for future guests.

,My misunderstanding occurred the next day when I saw our bill which did not reflect that he had taken care of things which he said he would.

Since leaving Fernando is now claiming that the one thing he promised was a ""VIP check in"" and that's it for our next trip, and a limo to the airport and the room charges for this trip. I filled out a survey very completely. I was contacted by a assistant manager and offered a one level room upgrade next trip. What a joke. Wynn doesn't have an ounce of integrity and they will deceive you to keep you there. Their canned BS Reply that their management is reviewing is so phony. Nobody ever followed up with the red card desk. Nobody has satisfactorily followed up with me.",2,0,0

Our friend booked a block of rooms for her birthday party attendees at a steal...knew someone or something.  So we stayed in a tower resort suite for the price of a nice off strip hotel. Everything's better when you are getting a deal.

Check in was a bit of a zoo...we were in line for 15 minutes or more. But once we got to the front, the front desk person was quick, efficient and helpful.  We were warned that Sunday check lines were horrific so best to check out via tv in room. YAY!  (Also this was kind of cool cuz I lost my hubby at one point and by reviewing our bill on tv, I found he was in the gym. He had to pay $15 for access but I guess that's Vegas right?)

Mix of people staying here...X and Y generations were about even. Made for some great people watching.

Loved the swank decor-felt so Vegas with all of the mirrors. Our view was mountain\/downtown not the strip but still looked amazing at nite.
My hubby loved the tv in the bathroom and the big flat screen that swivled for viewing from living area or bed.

Even though we were out late and at the pool early...I got the best sleep in our bed. Most comfortable hotel bed I have ever been in. Wonder if they sell them like the Ritz does?  Anyways...

Closet was nice sized although we could've used more hangers. There were tons of drawers throughout the room and in the closet. Token honor bar with outrageously priced items...if you move them you will pay. 

The Encore is connected to the Wynn by a hallway of shops so once I forgot which side of the hallway I was on and took the elevator up to the 35th floor on the Wynn side. Couldn't figure out why my key wouldn't work. Oops. This was Before we went out...it was a mistake the bell man said happens alot.

There are 3 pools...the Encore Beach Club pool which you enter like a club...has stripper poles and lots of dancing party people...and then the ""regular"" pool for ""regular"" people and then the European pool for 21 and over where you can choose to go topless or not.  Needless to say, very few topless while we were there and mostly guys in the pool. 

I do recommend renting a cabana if possible as that was a fun experience and since they are air conditioned($600 but not awful if you split with loads of people) ...makes it possible to enjoy being outside when it's 107 degrees like last weekend. Flat screen tv, lots of towels, small fridge with complimentary non alcoholic beverages, our own dedicated server and 2 restaurants we could order food from. They didn't seem to enforce the maximum allowed people in the cabana so we had lots of folks coming and going. 

Wynn vs Encore- I choose Encore.  Less smokey around the casinos and just seemed less ""themey"" to me.",5,2,3

I was so stoked. So we got to the hotel and the lobby was packed. I had read on another post that you could get a ""complimentary upgrade"" with a trick called ""The Sandwich"" it is on www.frontdesktip.com if you want the details. I did ""The Sandwich"" asked for a complimentary upgrade and was sent to Encore with a pool view room. I wasn't sure if this was an upgrade but we thought it was, the room was spectacular. I felt like a kid. I just wanted to live there. The room had marble floors and the bathroom was enormous with dual sinks and a shower and jacuzzi bath tub and my favorite a flat screen in the bathroom! The bed was a king and was big and comfy and the living room was a great size with a floor to ceiling window that overlooked the pool as well as a beautiful view of the strip and The Wynn. The Plasma was cool how it separated the bedroom from the living room and could be turned. There was a controller next to the bed that controlled the lighting and drapes, very high tech.

Hand's down, this was the nicest, poshest hotel I've stayed at, ever. It is certainly the nicest one in Vegas. The attention to detail is apparent everywhere, and the hotel itself, and the casino, and all the shops and restaurants within are above reproach. Where to begin?

Let's start with the hotel room. It's not really a ""room""; it's a suite. My folks and I had adjoining room\/suites on the 15th floor, overlooking the Strip. Wow, I felt like a movie star! The suite was so beautiful, so roomy and spacious. When you enter, there is a hallway with the bathroom off to the side. The bathroom is huge, with a glass-enclosed shower (GREAT shower, too, with two large shower heads and a marble bench to sit on or, for you ladies out there, to prop a foot to shave your leg! A little detail, but this is what makes this place stand apart from the rest), deep tub, looong marble counter with two recessed sinks, and all the bells and whistles (recessed wall-mounted tv? Check. Scale under the sink? BOO! But yes, check! Complimentary high-end robes and slippers to use? Check! Really fine quality lemongrass citrus gels and shampoos and lotions and potions? CHECK! TONS of towels - which I love, a great hairblower, and a toilet area with a door for more privacy). They really thought of everything. 

The closet area is very roomy with a safe for your valuables.

Next is the bedroom area. The bed, pillow and linens made for the deepest sleep I've ever had. It was the most comfortable bed I've ever been on. There's an electronic panel bedside to control the drapes and lights. The huge tv separates the bedroom area from the living room area and it swivels 360 degrees. The living room has a deep sectional sofa and ottoman and desk. 

On this floor in this location (end of the hall), we heard no noise. It was super quiet. The only issue I have with the amenities is the mini-bar\/fridge\/food variety on top of the dresser\/bar. You cannot use the fridge (not to keep your Cokes cool, even!), and if you take any snacks off the top of the dresser for more than 60 seconds, you'll get charged for them! So even if you just want to read the label, man, you better read fast! (I thought this was a little over-the-top, and not in keeping with this classy hotel).

Aesthetics and art and design are subjective entities, but my parents and I just LOVED the design and architecture and lay-out and colors and artwork of this hotel and casino and all its various restaurants and shops. There's a huge de Koons metallic sculpture of tulips in blindingly bright colors. Gorgeous mosaics on floors and walls. Huge bright coral-red chandeliers in the casino. And windows! Windows opening up the place to light! Overlooking formal gardens and waterfalls. 

We walked the Strip and entered all the major casinos and hotels, to get a feel of the different themes and check out the designs and architecture of them all. One thing I will say about the Encore: compared to ALL the other casino\/hotels, the smell of cigarette smoke is least noticeable at the Encore. 

One last note: from my 2 shuttle drivers who drove me to this hotel and then back to the airport, to folks we talked to who worked in the stores we shopped in, all said the same thing: that Wynn treats his employees well. Many of these people have applied for jobs at the Encore. I think this speaks volumes.",3,0,3

When we arrived at the hotel the computers we're down and they were having trouble checking people in.  This is understandable, computers are finicky, especially with large complicated servers that this hotel\/casino must have.  The least you could do is give out a small room comp for the wait, breakfast maybe?  Or ATLEAST inform us that we should check in at the Tower concierge instead of coming back twice to find out we could have checked in the whole time!

While checking in we we're informed that our late checkout, free breakfast, hotel credit and guaranteed upgrade we we're promised upon booking we're not going to happen.  Again, not so much as a comp to make up for this.  We also requested a roll away bed, ""no problem sir."".  1 hour later we call for the roll away as it hasn't showed up.  AGAIN 1 hour after this we call again.  We didn't see that role away the WHOLE trip, it never came.

Moving on.  The ""Tower King Suite"", IS TINY.  $450 a night!! C'mon Steve.

We we're not going to let this nonsense get us down, this is Vegas baby, and we're here, so lets have some fun.  Over the course of the weekend I spent a hair over 6 grand on the room, drinks, food and gambling.  You would be hard pressed to say I was a bad customer to the hotel.

Upon checkout, I come to find that my supposed ""players card"" had no gambling time on it and that there was, ""nothing they could do"".

You come to Vegas to party hard and be treated like royalty, especially when dropping 6 grand at the ""Nicest"" hotel in Vegas while staying in a Tower Suite, especially being former Marine Corps.

Steve Wynn, you owe me my money and time.  Disgraceful.",11,3,1

The Wynn \/ Encore empire is completely amazing and they both reign triumphant over the Vegas strip. The Wynn lies majestically at the North End of the Strip, and behind that you will find Encore. 

We stayed here in August 2017, on our annual trip to Vegas when we celebrate our wedding anniversary. When I first walked in, all I saw were butterflies. Lots and lots of lovely butterflies... on the walls, on the carpet, at the front desk, on the gummy candy they have inside the guest rooms, everywhere. We checked in early and got upgraded to a Panoramic King Suite. Happily paid the extra fee per night to be on the 54th floor instead of the 18th which was the only other floor available at the time of check-in. The view was great because we got half of the golf course view and the other half of the north Strip. Pro tip: if you do not want noise, ask for a room on the OTHER side from where the Encore Beach Club is located. You will thank me later. And you will rest in peace. 

THE BED. Oh my heavens that is a comfortable bed. The drapes that close at the touch of a button and the lights that go from Light, Medium to High are also fantastic. If you want to do a spot of reading before bed simply turn on your soft lights above the bed and you're all set. Another button turns everything off and you can go to sleep.

We got $100 food and beverage credit which we used at the Buffet and drinks at the pool on our last day. 

The one drawback from being so far on the North end of the strip is that you have to walk miles upon miles upon miles to do anything. Not a deal breaker by far, but a slight inconvenience. We did walk over to the Fashion Show Mall on a daily basis, they have great selections for quick coffees and small meals. We went to the new Sugar Factory for breakfast and also visited Starbucks and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. One day we walked all the way to The Mirage to go to Brunch 2 for 1's with our My Vegas points. That was a wonderful brunch and worth the walk from Encore.

Overall, this is one of my favorite hotels. I've stayed at 6 different hotels in Las Vegas and this was in my top 2. The cigarette smoke is something I can never get used to, but at least most of the floors are non-smoking. They only have TWO smoking floors - they told me when I asked.  So the majority of the smoke smell comes from the casino. Despite this, we will definitely stay again!",2,0,0

The staff was very friendly and we had a great experience with the hotel overall. I've stayed at a few places in Vegas but this one takes the cake. I'm actually sad that I hadn't stayed here before.

Little things were annoying. Nothing major but little things. And to me, if you're paying $$$ to stay at a 5 star hotel, you're expecting nothing less than perfect.

First of all, check in took forever. I mean 30 minutes to check in. There were short, stubby lines but for some reason, the check in process took so long! When you've been on a plane for an hour, flying from a cold, cold city, itching to take off your clothes and switch to a bikini, the last thing you need is a long check in process! There was a line usher who offered us water!! That's how long it took. Felt even longer.

The room was amazing and unbelievably big. Definitely enough room for myself and my boyfriend. Our view was astonishing, facing the Wynn hotel. Try to get an EVEN number because you'll face the Wynn. Bed was super soft (bf hated it), TV was awesome (who watches TV)  and lounge area was a nice place to spread out my clothes.

However, after dinner, I was lying in bed and started hearing a loud, steady noise. We were pretty close to something called a ""machine room"" and realized it was coming room there. So my boyfriend asked the front desk to switch rooms. This took forever too!

Our new room was a few floors down, more towards Surrender\/Encore Beach Club. The front desk warned us that people have complained of the noise from there. And YES, we could hear the bass. I didn't want to bother switching again and honestly, I passed out at night anyways.

On our last morning, we were sleeping and recovering from a night out when housekeeping knocked on our door. We had the privacy light on (there's no placard) and yet, homegirl still walked in. ""Housekeeping? Oh sorry, I come later.""

You KILLIN ME smalls.

Other notes:
- NO toothpaste. We had to buy it downstairs and it was $5.00 for a TRAVEL (aka DINKY) size.
- Bath robes smelled kinda funky in the first room. Smelled fine in the second.
- Did not like the lemongrass shampoo.
- Encore pools fill up QUICK. Grab them while you can.

Very modern & calm colors. The decor is great. Right up my alley. The decorin the restaurants & clubs is amazing as well. My advice just don't stay here & beware of room #3415. This is the worst hotel to stay in, in Vegas. I used to love the Wynn but it's hands down the worst experience & the customer service is a joke. My amazingly beautiful room is for looks only. Well, the bath tub is nice & so are the fixtures. I enjoyed taking a bath in there. There's also a tv so I was able to catch up on sports. Nice touch & that's where the good stuff ends.

The shower leaked so bad I had a pond in the bathroom. The floors are marble & white so you don't see it walking in. Of course they don't put floor mats in their bathrooms. I fell & injured myself. I'm not going to detail exactly what happened because it's bad but I called downstairs & they asked if I needed medical attention. I figured I wasn't dying so I said no. They didn't offer to send a maid to clean the mess so I had no choice but to do it. Now last time I checked I wasn't hired by the Encore to be a maid. All the towels & robes on the floor didnt soak up all the water. Next door to us there was a maid cleaning the room we asked her to come clean the wet floor when she was done with the room & she never came. Apparently, she didn't think it was her job either. They called a tech to fix it the leaky shower while we were in the room. Inconvience! My bro in law went looking for a maid on our floor & she said she'd come back later which she did. She said she'd check the shower after the tech to make sure it was fixed. All lies! The tech said the seal was broken that's why the water leaked everywhere. But, guess what? After he ""fixed"" it, it still leaked the next day & I slipped again. 

The hotel never offered to give us another room or comp us. The stay was dreadful. They didn't even seem to care or say sorry. Other then that the room service was awful. They don't follow direction & I got sick off the lobster eggs benedict. I won't even go into how sick. Then when I called to ask for an item it took them 3 1\/2 hours to bring it up when they said it would be right up. I called 4 times & at one point they said it would be up in 15 minutes. And, of course it wasn't. 1 1\/2 hours later it got there. I called to speak with a manager & they said no one was available opon checkout. No managers at a busy Vegas Hotel? I told the girl to have the manager call me. After days of not hearing anything I decided to blast them on twitter & a few ppl called me then. All I was offered was 1 night free stay. It was a total joke after my experience. So I didn't accept. Moral of the story these hotels are shady & honestly don't care even if you're hurt.

The rooms are kept very new, clean, and all the amenities are also in good conditions.  We were pretty high up, forget which floor, so noise was not an issue.

My TIP to you, did you know that although Wynn\/Encore is advertised as the only 5 star\/5 diamond hotel on the Strip, only certain rooms qualifies this rating.

The entire hotel is well appointed and beautifully decorated:  hallways, gardens, public areas, restaurants, and clubs.  Check-in on a Friday was quick and easy as was check-out on a busy Sunday.  If you happen to lose your room key (like we did), take a trip to the front desk and they'll replace it in a flash.

Resort Suites
The decor is classy and luxurious with marble-like floors, premium bedding, ipod docs, and touch control draperies.  The bedroom areas are separated from the small sitting area, which had impressive floor-to-ceiling windows with a spectacular view.  Internet access was expensive: $14\/day.

Bathroom
This baby seemed to be almost as large as the bedroom and sitting area combined!  It had a separate glass walk-in shower, tub, and vanity area with double sinks.  I also liked that the toilet area was enclosed for privacy.  Another plus, flat screen tv in the bathroom.

Encore is smaller than Wynn but if you need more, just walk right through the shopping areas and Voila! you are at the larger Wynn.  The great part was that we never had to step out into the chilly January weather.  The walkway connected us right through to the next door hotel.  The temperature indoors was comfortable--no jacket needed while sauntering off to the clubs in your sexiest dress.

We had drinks and food one night in the lobby bar that serves smaller dishes.  I recommend the late night burger.  Very good!

The hotel is absolutely beautifully decorated, the room service breakfast is pure quality, and the rooms are huge GORGEOUS suites!  Customer service is impeccable too, just what you'd expect from a hotel of this quality. 

We stayed last weekend for my birthday, and the hotel sent up a delicious mini-cake and 2 chocolate-covered strawberries with a sweet birthday card for me!   

The gaming floor is much smaller here than at the Wynn, so we usually walk over there to gamble.  But if you like a more intimate casino setting, this is very nice. The places to ""have a cocktail"" (one of my favorite things to do in Vegas :)) are more varied at the Wynn too.  But obviously they are sister hotels, and are within a very short walking distance through the shopping esplanade to get to each other, so we just go back and forth as we like, no biggie!

I absolutely love the decor, concept and style of this hotel complex which is why I have kept coming back but the service over the past weekend was beyond terrible, especially if you factor in the price to stay here. I have received regular spa and salon treatments previously but there seems to have been a change in the skill set and procedures - on one day my fake eye lashes they applied had clumps of glue and were uneven, and on another day I was late to my appointment (I did call and notify them) and the salon would not honor the residual time I had left without trying to charge me double ie. my appointment was for 45 minutes and I was 20 minutes late (yes late!) and they would not allow me to use the remaining 25 minutes when I suggested we modify things to accommodate my tardiness unless I paid double! On top of being consistently hustled by the hotel casino staff for many things including being told to significantly increase our bets (so we would lose more) this whole experience was pushed over the edge by being served (more than two nights in a row) expired chocolates by house keeping turn down service - we filed a formal complaint about this and since then have spoken to the hotel who's view is that the 'French' expiry date is the wrong way around! So I was born in London and have a house in France and am VERY clear on the different ways Europeans and Americans place and sort their expiry dates and let me tell you that these chocolates expired on Feb 2014 (not 2017!) - of course the hotel does not agree because this could be law suit for them if they receive multiple complaints about this.

The room itself was amazing. The bed was super comfy. Our strip view was beautiful. I really actually enjoyed the location. Who needs the other end of the strip? When you are staying at Wynn\/Encore, you don't really ever need to leave the hotel complex. Especially when it's 104 degrees outside.

The gaming floor is certainly smaller than the Wynn's, but not horribly small like I had pictured from the reviews I've read. We hung out by the European pool, where much to my surprise everyone was not naked.  Service poolside was great.

I have to admit, I had high expectations after reading all the rave reviews and hearing over and over again how this was a five star resort.  Perhaps my expectations were a little TOO high.  The rooms were beautiful but overall I would say our experience here was only average, and we probably won't stay here again. Nex time I will opt for the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay. Here are some more details about our stay:

Pros: 
1) The rooms. Gorgeous and spacious.  Everything is electronic, so you can be uber-lazy and shut your draps or put out the privacy notice without leaving the bed.  The beds were very comfortable, and the pillows were heavenly.

2) The on-site staff. They were five-star friendly.  Everyone bends over backwards to make sure you're happy and comfortable.

Cons:
1) The towels in our room REEKED of smoke.  Now, my parents didn't have this problem in their room, so I think maybe our maid was a smoker.  But it was a problem every single day we were there, so it wasn't just one stray towel.  ICCKKK.  

2) The hallway of our floor (12th floor) also reeked of smoke half the time. Now, I understand this is Las Vegas, but we specifically asked to stay on a NON-SMOKING FLOOR!  And there are signs everywhere, so I don't know why it smelled so terrible.

3) The other half of the time, the hallway reeked of pungent cleaner mixed with a ham sandwich. I'm not kidding. It was such a strong, gross smell, we wanted to throw up.

2) The resort is small and offers few amenities compared to the Wynn. You have to walk over to the Wynn for practically everything. My b\/f wanted to get his shoes shined and had to walk to the Wynn. Ditto for me when I wanted to get a facial- their spa is very small and was booked up.

3) The pool.  It is placed right between the Wynn and the Encore and gets sun for only two hours in the morning. What a stupid place to put the pool.  It was shaded and cold all afternoon.

Beware, the Encore is not all it's cracked up to be!!",1,3,1

I've stayed at Bellagio, Mandalay, Mandalay Hotel, MGM Signature, the Ritz Carlton, the Four Seasons and some others but this place is by far the best.  First of all, the pools are awesome.  Reminded me of the Atlantis pool in the Bahamas.  The one thing I didn't like was there wasn't really any shady areas.  And the only umbrellas were under the cabanas or special chairs that they were renting at like $300 a pop.  During the week too, not even on the weekends.  
Other than that, the hotel was VERY clean.  The housekeeping was the BEST I've ever experienced.  I normally get very heebed out by hotels but this place was so clean.  Also, there weren't kids there which was nice for 20-30 somethings.  
I didn't eat at the hotel but noticed that the coffee place downstairs was very expensive.  I guess that's expected but a starbucks in the hotel would have been nice.  Even if it was a 5 min. walk.  The price of drinks were about $15\/drink at the pool and a bit pricey but they put enough alcohol so worth the price.  
The casino is clean, the employees there were very nice, didn't seem like they hated their jobs like some casino employees.  Very classy place.  
I'd recommend it highly.  One other thing, you can't put anything in their fridge as it's weight sensitive.  I would suggest that we have the option to put drinks or whatever in there like some hotels or even a mini kitchen like the Signature but I'm assuming it's cuz Encore would rather have you eat there.  The ppl staying there are a bit older or more wealthy.  You're not going to get the ""party"" hard rock crowd which is nice.

Everything about this place screams luxury and it definitely deserves all of its 5 stars. The lobby is impeccable and although less busy than the neighboring Wynn, still has the same red motifs. Hallways are long and wide, and walls are thick enough that I never heard any noises from the neighboring rooms, but the winner is the room itself. It was ginormous and probably bigger than my studio apartment! Everything from lighting to window shades is operated with a remote control found next to one of the most comfortable beds anywhere, and the bathroom made me feel like I was Marilyn, minus the drugs. 

There are many 5 star hotels to choose from in Vegas, but few come close to this one. For example, even though the Trump across the street is also ranked as a 5 star hotel, it does not even come close to this one and you just don't feel that same level of luxury that you would at Encore. In addition, the buffet, casino, and the clubs at the Wynn and Encore are one of the best in Vegas, so you are pretty much in the center of it all. Although for a popular weekend it may not be worth staying here because of its excessive price, I was able to score a good deal last year on the actual Wynn website (rather than booking through Expedia and such) that also included admission to the Wynn buffet, which is $40 on its own and some specials will even include VIP passes to XS or Tryst, so it may be worth checking out.",5,0,0

I was extremely happy with my stay at Encore for two nights from the flawless booking to the reservation making at the Spa.  Encore is a little far in terms of accessibility to other Strip attractions, but if you're looking for a luxurious place to stay with high end amenities, it's worth it.  I had a 2 queen bed resort tower suite with a view of the Strip and overseeing the pools.  The room was spacious and had a large mirror wall in the entry hallway which is great for getting ready when there are multiple women around.  The bathroom was roomy with a stool and center vanity with dual sinks.  The bathroom does have a TV in it, a shower and separate tub.  The shower is amazing here - way better than most hotels with adequate water pressure.

One of my favorite things about Encore is the Spa at Encore.  I made a reservation for five women to get massages and facials on a Sunday morning and everything was seamless.  The spa is beautifully decorated in a Moroccan\/Middle Eastern motif and the staff is very friendly.  You are supplied with robes\/slippers (in your size, they ask when you arrive) and there is an array of flavored spa water, tea and coffee for your drinking pleasure in the entry lounge and the tranquility room.  There are multiple whirpools, plunge pools and a sauna and steam room.  Shower amenities are great and spacious.  My massage was amazing and worth every penny.

Shopping, dining and gaming is great here as well with lots of great selections.  The Eastside Lounge boasts live music, but on Sat night we were asked for $10 cover charge.  Easily can access the Wynn from here as well.  I would love to stay at Encore again!",1,0,0

My main complaint deals with housekeeping.  The room was not vacuumed upon our arrival, and not at all during our stay. The floor was not mopped either in the entry or bathroom.  We used the provided amenities to shower the first dsy. They did not replace them so on the second day the body wash ran out during my shower so my partner had to wait to take her shower for them to bring more.

Another problem is the registration area. Checking in at the appointed 3 p.m time the line was very long which is stsndsrd. However ther were only two chairs for others in any party to wait while the party is registered.

I adore that the theme for this place seems to be centered around butterflies. From the front steps, to the carpet in the non-tower suites, butterflies are everywhere. The casino is placed in the middle of the hotel, however you are not forced to transverse it to go to the elevators to get to your rooms. Anyone that has been in the some of the other hotels understands how distasteful this can be. 

The check-in process is fine as long as you arrive on a Thursday. They have been at capacity a number of the weekends I have stayed at Encore, and that can complicate matters. In addition, they are still working out some kinks with making sure everyone gets the rooms they requested online. However, once you get into your room, be prepared to be overwhelmed by the linens, the amenities in the bathroom (creams and such), and the view. 

This is a place to come to indulge, and to be seen. Oh, and the mirrors in the bedroom, not a bad touch for a Vegas night!",0,0,0

On a busy day, expect to wait about 20-30 minutes to check in and don't expect an apology or a bottled water for waiting... Paula (the gal who checked us in) was in a bad mood?? She wasn't at all inviting, warm or welcoming towards us. Not once did she ask us how we were, how our day was or even smile at us... My husband and I thought it was a little weird - but whatever....

We got to our room on the 35th floor... I immediately went to the restroom to wash my hands from our travels and I noticed the previous guest's false eyelashes on the counter (see photo).... I called down and asked them to send someone up to clean it which we stepped out for dinner... When we got back from dinner, we noticed housekeeping did stop by b\/c the hand towels i used were gone and stocked with fresh new ones, BUT she neglected to remove the false eyelashes... That can be forgiven...

I took a shower to end my night and I found myself standing in a puddle of water that covered my foot b\/c of the slow drain..(see photo) the water in fact overflowed onto the bathroom floor drenching the towel floor mat... I called down to have them fix this... again, this too can be forgiven...

Around 11pm, we heard our neighbors blasting their music very clearly.. they were playing robin thicks, ""blurred lines"". i called down and had security ask them to lower the volume - in which case, they did... again, forgivable - and not really the hotel's fault except for the fact that they have paper thin walls.

We got into bed to go to sleep and after tossing and turning for about an hour trying to figure out the repeating suction\/thump noise, i finally came to the conclusion that it was the elevator. Around 1 in the morning, i called down and asked to switch rooms b\/c both my husband and i couldn't sleep b\/c of the ongoing repeating elevator sounds... they couldn't switch us b\/c ""nothing was available"" and i was advised to call in the morning.... Around 2 or 3 am, i was so frustrated, i called front desk again and asked them to send up ear plugs and a noise canceling machine - they sent a fan and orange ear plugs that broke in half the minute i put them into my ears. Through exhaustion we were finally able to fall asleep around 4 in the morning... 

Next day... I was offered 2 different rooms on another floor... Now, before I check into hotels i do my homework and the number one complaint i read about encore is the noise.. I read tips on how I should ask for a room furthest from the clubs and to NOT get a room with a neighbor connecting door... and now my third request was to be far from the elevator... I communicated these 3 requests to Encore and they offered me a room with a connecting door... or another room near the elevator.......................... At this point I was frustrated b\/c the 3 front desk manager I spoke with (Miguel and Choona - Jason didn't even bother returning my phone call) didn't have any empathy for my situation - oh did I mention that I'm 6 and a half months pregnant? I was told by Choona that it was guaranteed that I wouldn't hear any noise on the new room with the connecting door b\/c they sent someone up to double check (which i really appreciate by the way). So b\/c of his guarantee, we packed our things and moved to the 38th floor... They were right, it was quiet... until 5 in the morning came around and the neighbors came back to their room and decided to continue their partying... I called front desk to complain and security handled it... my husband and I both irritated by the fact that we didn't get a good nights rest on either nights decided to just get up and check out.

Checking out.... I immediately asked the very nice front desk girl for the manager... Enter front desk manager Michael - who was also less than friendly.. my husband and I could both tell from the start he was not at all concerned or even cared about our issues... After I explained what we had gone through the last 2 days, he nonchalantly offered us 1 night comp to pretty much shut us up... When i asked for a full refund he snapped and said, ""i'm not going to do that."" ok, this is where I got pissed b\/c in the hospitality industry the one thing you do NOT say to a customer is, ""i'm not going to do that (for you)"" - there are other nicer ways to say the same thing. He explained that encore allowing us to switch rooms was doing us a favor and that it's out of the hotel's hand whether or not the neighbors are quiet... Basically, he was telling us that it's not the hotel's fault that they have paper thin walls and we couldn't get any sleep... His bottom line to us was, ""take it or leave it and shut up"" Again, he was super unfriendly or sympathetic - just plain cold....his apologies were mere empty words without any sincerity.",1,3,0

The main entrance has vibrant reds, entire hotel has an Asian theme with butterflies throughout. The Tower Suites area is done in vivant greens. Encore boasts natural sunlight, which is priceless in Vegas. Casino is probably the least smoky in Vegas (win).

Service was excellent - concierge was helpful. Absolute attention to detail: guest name programmed into the TV and phone on arrival. Do not disturb switch is a nice upgrade vs. standard door signs. 

ROOMS (Tower Suites)

Each floor is gorgeously appointed. Rooms are well-done in calm palettes.

Bathroom was spacious and well-lit. The only issue was the bathroom mirror sconces, which were awkwardly placed right in the middle of the mirror (bizarre) vs. flanking the sink\/wall. Amenities were nice.

Fully mirrored walkway was excellent. Curtains are drawn electronically. Settee area was well-thought out with a good layout. Beds were comfortable.

Minuses: 
- If you're on the Pool side, request 30th floor or higher to avoid the music noise - EBC\/Surrender are super-loud day\/night. 
- Extremely poor reception in the suites - was unable to place any mobile calls from the room. Have never encountered this issue at other hotels.

CLUBS

With Surrender (current favorite)\/Encore Beach Club (one of the hottest pool scenes right now) and XS (mega-legend) conveniently at the Wynn\/Encore, you basically have everything covered.

I wish they had self check-in like the MGM properties to save time, rather than waited for 30mins just to check-in. They do have self check-out, though.

Clean, the room smells fresh and well kept when we checked in
High tech room with auto switch for each room

Bathroom amenities are amazing, even have TV in there

Now comparatively it is smaller than even its big brother the Wynn but the hotel has been given every bit of detailed artistic look as its neighbors plus being one of the newest on the strip it looks ravishing and the staff is always on the look out to keep it like new.

When you get to the hotel the check in
Is immediately on the left and the hotel staff is extremely courteous. The only negative is that the wifi is extremely spotty and expensive and if you don't have great LTE reception, well you have to write your reviews later on when you get back.

We stayed on the 29th floor and the views were gorgeous. On one side we could see the ravishing pool of the Wynn along with the golf course and the airport in the background and on the other side we could see the strip and mall in front of the Wynn.

- beautiful decor and well lit areas for night time prowling
- free valet (but with some annoyance)
- upscale and free of trashiness
- rooms are clean, room service does a great job, well designed
- staff is courteous and professional at all times


cons:
- DO NOT STAY IN A ROOM NEAR THE NIGHT CLUBS, they are EXTREMELY LOUD AND YOU WILL NEVER SLEEP (pool side generally)
- valet is a block walk down from the main entrance
- sports book is a 2 block walk down into WYNN (WTF!)
- room service can be spotty (different employees, different ideals)
- $25 room service fee that should be disclosed
- don't offer free upgrades like other places do

Spacious & clean, but I would have to say I prefer the Wynn over the Encore. Overall decor & size of room & size of bathroom were better at the Wynn. Everything else was great, service was impeccable just as it was at the Wynn.

Only complaint was that my room had a funky odor I couldn't identify (kind of smelled like feet - ick). And by the time I really noticed it, I was already unpacked & too lazy to re-pack everything to move to another room. So I bought some room spray from Bath & Body Works & rid the room of the smell on my own haha.

Also, the pool: 1 advantage of being an Encore guest is that you have access to both the Encore AND Wynn pools (Wynn guests only get access to the Wynn pool & not both).

3.  There is no fresh food service by the pool during the week.  They sell expensive food that has been pre-packed and not made to order.  I get that they are watching their bottom line, but aren't we staying at the Encore???  Other hotels have figured it out--seems to me that Steve Wynn should be able to as well.  
4.  There are lots of tweaky, twenty-somethings running around filling up the day\/night clubs--which is fine and would explain the impatient service.  But if that is not your scene, the pool experience is boring and uneventful.  Kind of a waste, actually.  

I would stay here again for a retreat--to spa and have no scene.  That's not good or bad for me, just is.",11,3,6

The room: We stayed in a Panoramic Resort Room (king bed) located on the 62nd floor. It was probably the most tastefully decorated hotel room I've ever stayed in. Even though the room faced the ""wrong"" direction (towards the north), it still provided an amazing view. The bed in the room was the best I've ever slept on. The layout of the room is very efficient, but you won't be able to comfortably fit many more than the prescribed number of people in it (as opposed to the Palazzo). Housekeeping was extraordinary; not only keeping the room immaculate, but also finding fun and creative ways of organizing your daily aftermath of Vegas debauchery.

The common areas: Absolutely magnificently decorated. As tacky as it sounds, attention was given to literally every inch of this hotel. Throughout our 3-night stay, we constantly caught new details of each area we passed. It is literally unlike any other place I've been and makes the Venetian\/Palazzo look like a tacky mess.

The restaurants: Ate at the Buffet, Le Cave and Tableau. The buffet is probably the best one you can get in vegas. Le Cave was very mediocre. Sunday brunch at Tableau was the best breakfast I've ever had in my life (no exaggeration). Generally, the prices were reasonable by Vegas standards.

The pools: Most of our time was spent at the European pool, which was absolutely great. It has great decor, music, drinks, and a topless-optional policy for the female guests. There is also a quieter family-friendly pool not far away too, which provides a great chance to relax. If you only take one piece of my advice: Avoid the Beach Club like the plague.

The clubs: It's a shame; a lot of time\/money was obviously put into developing these clubs, but they are managed extremely poorly (especially regarding security). The security at the clubs are either too lax (XS) or downright fascist (Beach Club). If you want to go to either club, read my specific reviews on each in order to know what you're getting yourself into.

Le Reve: On this trip, I saw Ka, Crazy Horse, Love and Le Reve. Of the four shows, this one was #3 (Crazy Horse being the best, Love being the worst). The acrobatics were impressive, albeit repetitive, but the story is very simple and, at the same time, hard to follow. It wasn't a bad show, but not worthy of its high price-tag, in my opinion.

This resort is truly a gem. However, you'll need to research each part of the resort that you plan to visit, as there is a surprising lack of consistency from one place to the next.",0,0,0

The first time I went was soon after it opened and my boyfriend treated me to a romantic weekend (which turned into a week, but that's another story).  We stayed in a regular suite as there were no rooms available in the Tower, and that was alright.  Upon arrival we couldn't find a luggage valet to save our lives, which bothered me greatly, and check in was very slow, but the room was quite nice for a standard room.  Very comfortable and I was expecting lots of red, as per the casino floor, but it was all very muted-chic.  I wasn't so much a fan of the television mid-room; it was impossible for someone to sleep and the other to watch television without a snarl or two ;)

A few days later we moved to the Tower suites (and have since never gone back to the regular suites, some 4 visits later).  We stayed in a Parlor suite, and it is decadent - perhaps not quite to the extreme I was expecting (coming from Skylofts at MGM, nothing is quite as decadent as you'd hoped, I think) but gorgeous nonetheless.  The suite is enormous, the bed soft and comfortable, everything very new and shiny.  I LOVE the bathroom in the Parlor Suite - huge and gorgeous.  I'm not a fan of their Bambu product line, but whatever, small things.  

Encore, as a whole, is over the top and very, very rich-feeling.  This is my favorite casino in Vegas and although I hate to admit it we've gotten to know the craps dealers awfully well.  Really great people who are lots of fun.  Encore staff, I have found, are very personable.  The decor is not for everyone, but I find it awfully inviting after coming from the dimly lit, dingy casinos elsewhere on the Strip.

Love the personalized Red Cards (which are also your hotel room key).

XS Nightclub - best club in Vegas.  Pure is over.  Sorry.  Goes with the rest of the Encore theme - rich, decadent, over the top, and SO COOL.  Service A+; I had a craving for a Bloody Mary and some poor barback went and fetched me one from the casino.  Needless to say he got tipped awfully well at night's end.

The Spa at Encore is INSANE... go see it, if only to look around.  It's BEAUTIFUL, opulent, magnificent, astonishing.  Easily my favorite spa in Vegas, with the exception of a Four Seasons Essence of the Glaciers facial (or whatever they call it).  The services are wonderful, technicians well studied and professional, and there are beautiful pools and sitting areas in the spa.  They have these amazing heated stone loungers near one of the small pools that invite you in and then put you to sleep.  I've never been so comfortable in a public(ish) area before.

Cannot wait to stay here again.",1,0,1

I love getting massages at Encore Spa! I adore the decor, tranquility, square footage of spa and variety of spa packages. I usually get the 90 minute Swedish massage with extra add ons but recently I tried the Thai massage and I loved every moment of it. I run outdoors everyday and the stretching aspect of the massage felt great on my body. Sometimes a 90 minute massage can be boring after awhile but the Thai massage kept me active\/stretching. 

I usually stay at Tower Suites at the Wynn but I enjoy the decor of Encore's spa more. I'll walk the extra distance to relax in Encore's spa.

I really wondered how the Encore would compare to the Wynn since Wynn is probably the best hotel\/casino on the strip.

I was largely disappointed - by the casino decor.  The entire casino floor has these giant BRIGHT red chandeliers (I submitted photos) that really become nauseating after a couple minutes of looking at them.  Whoever picked this color was way in over their head and needs to go die.

The suites aren't really suites, just really large rooms, big enough for 6 people to sleep in comfortably (with two beds and couches), and possibly fit up to 12 people if half of your party is willing to sleep on the brand new floor, since there's a lot of open space (go look at my photos I submitted).  Large bathroom with his and her sinks and shower heads (2), though the removable one is sort of hard to grip.  We had an amazing view though (again, look my photos), since the rooms have floor to ceiling windows.

Overall, I don't think it's better than the Wynn, but it's definitely worth a stay, since the rooms are brand new and they have a completely different color scheme, decor, and vibe.  I guess really, I rate it a 3.5 :)

P.S.  Apparently no photography of the casinos allowed, 'cause when I was taking a photo of the disgusting chandeliers (again, photos), security came over and told me I couldn't take photos of the casino - which I thought was rude 'cause I was aiming my camera directly up at the chandelier.",7,5,5

They absolutely allow you to check into your room early .. For a fee (like if the room is ready regardless why do I have to pay an extra fee). You are charged a daily resort fee of something along the lines of 30-40 dollars a day which is totally standard ( for use of gym, wifi, ect..) however .. The wifi didn't work my entire stay and I got NO SERCIVE in my room so I kept missing calls from my friends that were meeting us!!! The house keeping service does nothing besides make the beds and take the glassware away, but the geniuses forget to give you new glassware. I called the front desk and asked for new glasses to be sent up and they told me it was going to be a charge of $7.50. Seriously ??? House keeping took all of our glasses and then you refuse to sent me new ones ?! How am I suppose to drink the extremely over priced champagne and liquor I was going to drink from your mini bar !! (There you go, you lost another sale) I'm staying in a ""5 star resort"" I would think they can send up glasses to my room with out charging me. It seems the only people who receive good customer service are the big time gamblers which is normal. But hey I came here to spend my money too ! Just because I decide to spend my money and delicious food and drinks instead of a poker game does not mean I deserve to be treated like a peasant. Me and my friends got horrible service at the two restaurants in the hotel that we decided to visit ( Jardin & the buffet) I think we were discriminated on because we do look very young and the state probably assumed we didn't have money to tip. But hello !!!! I have money to stay at this hotel and eat here so obviously I have money to tip. (Plus I was a waitress and I'm always a good tipper so shame on you for judging us on our age) none of the staff even offered a smile or a ""welcome"" or checked up on us to see how the food and drinks were. Just took our order and delivered the check. When we visited the buffet my friend was wearing high waisted shorts and a crop top and she was told she had to buy one of their t shirts because that's their dress code (LOL it's 115 degrees in Vegas and we can't wear crop tops ?!?!) any ways she did purchase the shirt because we were starving but once we were in the buffet we saw a girl wearing a bathing suit top and they didn't make her buy a t shirt !! So I went up to the manager and asked her to give us a refund for the shirt because it wasn't fair that the rules didn't apply to every body and she refused and told me ""exit to the left now please"" I felt so disrespected I couldn't believe she spoke to a paying customer that way. If you want good customer service and you want to enjoy your stay in Vegas DONT STAY AT THE ENCORE OR THE WYNN !!!! I will definitely be returning to Vegas but I will NOT stay at this hotel ever again. Also I spoke to several managers about my complaint and none of them cared to help me or give me any type of accommodations to make up for this horrible experience so that was a huge let down.",0,2,0

I'm sure many can agree with their love\/hate relationship with sin city, and after a recent bachelor party trip, I still feel the same way. One saving grace, The Encore hotel. 

I checked in last Friday afternoon and my room was ready to go. Pro tip: if you book through American Express, you're able to take advantage of the exclusive card benefits. Free breakfast every morning (up to $80), a $100 credit to the spa and early\/late check in. 

Let's start with the room. Beautiful and anxiety free. When you're in Vegas you need a safe zone, and these rooms were exactly that. Comfy beds, modern bathrooms and a great level of service. Highly recommend the suites with two queen beds. 

The casino below is also really great. The table limits are a bit higher than other properties but, you get what you pay for.

The restaurants (ok so I only tried Switch) was a little disappointing.. and while the decor is cool, it's nothing ground breaking. The views are impeccable.. not sure if all the rooms are facing the strip southbound, but the ones that are... wow.. what a view! If I ever had a room here on NYE , I'd watch the fireworks in style from my suite. 

Lucky for you, Yelp, I stayed in\/stepped foot in an Encore room, a Palazzo room, and a Trump room all in a span of 36 hours so I can write you a very good comparison of the 3 luxury hotels of the north end. I will rank them in a few categories from best to worst

Room Size\/Spacious feeling: Palazzo, Trump, Encore. Encore's wall divide thing creating 3 distinct rooms is fun, but the open sunken living room at Palazzo is hard to beat. 

Decor: Encore, Trump, Palazzo. Encore was very cohesive.. which I like. It felt like stepping foot into a red\/black\/white modern art painting. My dad hated the ""gaudy"" Encore however, so keep in mind this place is very modern. Palazzo the more I look at it is poorly decorated... the drapes look like an ugly grandma comforter, and the burgundy tones next to the browns look kinda icky. 

Bed: Trump, Encore, Palazzo. The bed at Trump ROCKS. Soooo comfy.

Bathroom: Trump, Palazzo, Encore. Encore sucked here... tiny bathtub.. WTF. A 5 star hotel should have a giant bathtub! The Trump bathtub with jets is incredible and huge. 

Personally I'd choose Trump if prices were equal for all 3. The kitchenette is a nice bonus too! While Encore is nice, I don't feel like it's fun modern decor makes up for the cramped feeling suite or the subpar bathroom.",7,2,3

While I didn't try the restaurants, the conference food we had was excellent. One day we did an authentic tasting Thai buffet for lunch. We also has events at three of the nightclubs: XS, Surrender and Intrigue. Good drinks, nice hors d'oeuvres and really attentive and helpful staff.

I'm a bit jaded when it comes to nice hotels (after all, most hotel rooms are the same after you stay in enough of them), but I loved the unique, modern, classy-yet-trendy style of the Encore rooms. Major props to whoever did the interior design for the rooms - I took pictures because I want my future condo to look just like the room I stayed in.

Gorgeous panoramic view of the entire street, mirrors throughout the living room and bedroom areas, giant fluffy bed, enormous bathroom.... Loved it! 

I'm definitely going to be booking at Encore for my next visit, as this is now my new #1 favorite place to stay (with #2 being the Venetian and the Bellagio at a distant #3).

They also have a lot more slot machines here than anywhere else.  The restaurants are better.  And the overall feel of the casino is just so ""vegas"".

Encore doesn't have a sports book which isn't a good thing...

I put a hundred into a video poker machine and ordered a coffee.   It wasn't comped, I had to pay $4 which is Neiman Marcus prices.

The Wynn carries the name of Las Vegas' greatest developer, Steve Wynn.  The Encore is really just another wing of the Wynn, with all the same levels of finish and amenities.  At every turn, a lovely narrated video or other media gives you Mr. Wynn's personal welcome to the property.  This is the only welcoming element of our stay that I experienced.  

To start, Encore loses a star for neglecting to curb cigarette smoke.  It's everywhere.  It's in the casino; it's in the bars; it's in the restaurants; it so pervasive outside at the pool that your clothes will stink from outdoor second-hand smoke.  It's just bad.  There's a Mr. Smokestacks at every turn.

I suppose the reason Encore and Wynn are so behind the times in the tobacco department is that the whole casino seems tailored to attract tourists from China and other distant areas.  What would normally be features of a hotel\/casino that might give it an exotic flair seem more like deliberate kowtowing to the almighty yuan.  If you aren't the child of an asian oligarch, you might as well be a loiterer at the Wynn.

To see for yourself how America's purchasing power has been obliterated, one cheap Walmart sale at a time, take a stroll down the Wynn's esplanade.  The Wynn is home to some of the greatest shops in town.  The indoor mall is practically dripping with designer brands.  About 1\/3 of the store employees speak Mandarin.  Nothing spoils the old European romance that Hermes projects like a pack of tourists haggling in Chinese.

The property isn't as much a hospitality business as a money-collector.  That is to be expected of a casino.  But, here's the rub.  Of the 15 or so individual restaurant or bar businesses my wife and I visited, in only one - Andrea's - did the server say, ""Hi, my name is _____, and I'll be your waiter."" or, ""May I take your plate\/drink\/etc.""  The lack of this personal attention will wear on you; probably most noticeably when your table is being bussed as you are sitting at it.  

Everywhere we went - the bars, the restaurants, the tables at the casino - you get pounced by buss boys.  I like the last 20% of my drink.  I slow down toward the end of a meal and enjoy the conversation.  This is not an invitation to take my plate or glass.  But, they do.  It's criminal.  And the effect is that you feel like, ""Hurry up and order something else,"" or ""pay and leave.""

A hotel should make you comfortable.  The folks at this place know that if they keep you uncomfortable they can get more money out of you.  Maybe it's the same all over Vegas.  But, I didn't feel welcome at the Encore at all.",0,1,0

This place rocked my socks off. The only negative would be the long wait for the check-in lines (but what good Vegas hotel doesn't have this?!) Encore, like it's sister (or brother) hotel Wynn, is fabulous with a capital F. 

The hotel lobby and gambling area is immaculate, not smokey and modern looking. The rooms are even better. HUGE room and bathroom. Albeit the shower was a wee bit on the small side and the toilet was a bit ""higher"" than I'd like it to be (hey, I'm only 5'4!), the room was perfect. I loved that you could control the room settings with a switch of a button. With two quick button presses - voila!  Lights out and drapes closed for bed time. 

If you can get a deal (like we did) and not pay full price, definitely stay here (or at the Wynn). But the Encore was the best hotel I've ever stayed at (in Vegas)",3,1,1

They love the encore and we were given a choice of the Wynn or Encore. The encore rooms looked more aesthetically pleasing so the encore it was.

Room: I really enjoy how theres a wall dividing the living area and the couch area. Its like you have a really cozy suite as compared to Caesars where its one gigantic room that needs more furniture or the Palazzo where you have a ""suite"" but no room dividers. 2. The couch is incredibly comfortable. I could sleep on that thing. 3. They have a light\/drape control on your nightstand that turns on\/off the lamps\/ceiling lights in the foyer, living area and suite. The lamps also have their own on\/off button so you can really decide to your preference how bright you want your room to be. Note: gotta hold it till it turns all the way on or off. 4. The television swivels so you can watch on the couch or in bed. 5. Privacy button is also on the nightstand control so you dont have to get out of bed to prevent the maid from coming in. 6. Room is probably decorated the best out of all the hotels ive been in so far. Very modern and comfortable. 7. Television comes with a channel guide on the television telling you whats on and also a little paper one telling you which channels are which #.
Bathroom: Shower has an extra showerhead you can pull out. Theres one normal overhead and one you can control. Convenient for rinsing off after a bath or from the pool. 2. Middle of the sink is a makeup mirror and a stool underneath. Its a space saving way for them to have a vanity. Extremely convenient. I love it when they have vanities in the room. 3. Bathroom amenities include: the usual lotion, shampoo, conditioner, hand\/face soap, bath soap, shower cap, qtips along with the not as usual shower gel, shoe polish\/buffer, nail filer, round makeup applicator pads. 4. I forgot makeup remover so i just used those and rubbed some face soap on it and it worked like a charm. 5. Television in bathroom can be viewed very well from the shower and also from the tub. 6. Bathrobes provided. I wasnt that fond of them. Theyre like silk or something on the outside and towel on the inside making them hard to put on. My arm would get constantly stuck in the sleeve.",6,1,1

PLEASE! Don't get me wrong this hotel is BEAUTIFUL! We came here to gamble one night, you know kind of change up the scene, and my cousins friend works here at the encore so we decided to see if he was working so she could visit him, (were from Hawaii so visiting friends in Vegas is a MUST) unfortunately he wasn't working so we decided to walk around the hotel and gamble. 
My husband was really thirsty, we had just finished watching a show and so in between times he hadn't had a drink (water). So he walks up to a cocktail waitress who then gives him attitude. Mind you, we weren't dressed fancy, he was wearing a sweater and shorts, shoes, we weren't dressed ghetto or anything, just not wearing heels and gowns or dress shirts and slacks. The lady (cocktail waitress) ignored him a few times snubbing him when he's only asking for WATER! She then replies this water is taken! Ummm. FOR WHO?  We're spending OUR money on YOUR machines in YOUR casino! He then walks to the bar and the bar tender charges him $5.00 for a small ass bottle of Fiji water. Whole point of this.... JUST because of the way someone dresses, DO NOT assume they are poor, we are not poor in any way, we were spending just as much money on the machines and tables as other people, in fact we could have been the richest people there and that's the way we were treated! Encore and Wynn were on my list to stay while in Vegas, but now i have a bad taste in my mouth for them. 

VALET: We got to the valet and we sat in the waiting room, the BOYS, behind the counter starting swearing up a storm! I'm not sure if they forgot we were in the waiting room, but these guys mouths were filthy! *F THIS F THAT, that F'ing thing!* Dude so FAKE. Another couple came up to the window and they quickly snapped into ""FAKE"" mode. Also valet here like to crank up the radio. I remember turning it down when we got to valet because my cousin was face timing with her daughter, but once we got the car back it was on 18 vol. 

All in all, not sure if I will be back. Highly disappointed with the service, only nice people were the ones behind the front deck who checked to see if my cousins friend was working... Hate people who would judge a book by its cover.",6,2,0

I especially agree with what Florio had to say as I had a similar experience with my stay the same weekend! Sidenote: I don't know Florio.  Anyways, this place is a waste of money.  The only good thing about this entire hotel is that XS is downstairs. And beware of the $75 food credit to Andrea's, the place is very overpriced.

We checked in 8\/15\/14 to celebrate two events, our friends getting engaged and my birthday.  The lady at the counter got my information wrong initially, but that was not a big deal.  We checked into the room and I was kind of shocked at how small the room was.  The site made it seem bigger than what it was and I was told that it was about 700 sq. ft.  This room did not feel like that, but whatever right?  We didn't spend much time in the room initially and came back to the hotel kind of late-ish after going to XS.  Around 8am while I was in a sleepy haze I woke up to a disgusting stench of vomit.  I thought maybe my husband threw up or am I just going crazy but it smells like vomit.  I knocked out again and when I woke up around noon I asked my husband did you throw up? What is that smell?  He didnt.  I looked around and right under my nose between the bed and the night stand was small chunks of vomit.  I jumped up and called housekeeping.  The woman on the phone sounded mortified and I felt sort of relieved that this isn't a small deal to them either.  She told me that someone will be up ""right away"" I asked her okay well do you have an ETA and she said ""like right now, right away"" I was pleasantly surprised and said okay we'll be here.  40  minutes later, no one was there.  I gave up and went to shower, I finished showering and someone finally came.  So about an hour later after I called.  The nice man who came cleaned it all up and we even tipped him, for something that they should've cleaned before our check in might I add.  Anyways he told us to turn up the AC to get rid of any chemical smell, so we did.  We left to have a late lunch and came back to the room couple of hours later and the vomit smell was back.  I called again and told them the smell was back.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  He offered me a different room on the same floor or another room on the 29th floor.  Here's the problem with this.  We were on the 51st floor, and we paid extra for the panoramic view.  This was an additional 30 dollars extra per night.  He wanted to move us to a room that was facing the gold course.  WHO wants to face the gold course if they paid EXTRA to see the strip? And who wants to downgrade to the 29th floor? Where you can hear XS right at your ear and again you cannot see the strip! So I told the supervisor really nicely that we paid extra for this view and we're here celebrating and we can't because we have to deal with this stuff.  He said he can't do anything but those options but he could have someone come up and clean the room AGAIN and remove the extra 30 dollar charge for panoramic view.  I accepted the offer and gave him specific instructions on where the vomit was and also suggested that maybe there's vomit elsewhere like under the bed or something like that.  They came in and cleaned the room thoroughly and the smell was gone for the most part.  

As far as staying here to have ease of access to XS, that was the only upside. but to be honest, when I stayed at the Trump which was maybe a little cheaper than the Encore, we had a much better time.  It was right across from Wynn and we had an almost 24 hour shuttle taking us back and forth from the Trump.  It was a really good stay and I felt like I was exploring Vegas more so than when I stayed at Encore because everything was downstairs.  That may be good for others and I thought it would be good for me, but it just wasn't. I will never stay at this hotel if I don't have to. We didn't even get like a bottle of champagne sent up to us or some strawberries, SOMETHING to say hey we're sorry for not cleaning your room properly.  Also what I didn't know till later was that when we first checked in my husband went to use our restroom and there was PEE DROPLETS on the rim of the toilet.  How can you trust a hotel room if the most important part hasn't been cleaned?

Overall, I would never stay at this hotel ever again.  I have stayed at other hotels in Vegas that were less stars than the Encore and I certainly felt like I was important to the hotel.  And honestly if you're staying at the Encore for luxury and ease of access, just don't.  You won't feel the luxury and you will not feel important to them at all.  It's super overpriced and the return is not that impressive.  If they could charge you for breathing their air, they would.  I ordered room service and they charge you 5 dollars for no reason at all and then a mandatory 18% tip.  When I was checking out they asked me how my stay was and I said terrible, I got the ""oh im sorry"" and that's about i",1,0,0

First, I was SUPER excited to stay at this hotel. From the website and reviews, it seemed like it was gonna be one of the greatest experiences ever in Vegas. What's not to be excited about? Newest hotel on the strip, beautiful decor, huge rooms, amazing restaurants and the hottest club (currently) in Vegas. How can I possibly give it a 2 star rating? Let me explain....

For starters, it's billed as a 5 star resort. As such, I have some expectations on the service that I receive. While at Encore I have to say that the service was less than stellar. Our limo arrived around 11 ish and did anyone greet us? Nope. We were packed for a 2 week vacation and had some luggage. No one came out to assist. Fair enough. Then, the bellhops see that we have this luggage and you think they open the door? Nope. Funny, at the Palazzo and the Venetian the are falling over each other to help. These guys just all turned the other way. Not welcoming at all. Yes, I'm nitpicking, but you know what? You say you are all about the service, yet our experience was that we were a nuisance vs. a guest.

Next, we got to check-in. Like many have already said, it is absolutely terrible. Not nearly enough people working to accommodate the amount of people checking in. Took almost 40 min. to check in. And the lady had a tude, never asked if we wanted an upgrade, if we wanted to schedule any services (spa, cabana, things I specifically asked for when I made the reservation), nothing. Hmmm...def not what I expect in a 5 star resort. 

So, we get to our room on the 60th floor. It's an amazing view....of the Hilton and Circus Circus. Thanks for nothing front desk lady. Now the room itself was actually gorgeous. Super comfortable bed, nice amenities, huge bathroom, exactly what I was expecting. No complaints on the room except the view. Would like to have had a view of the Strip facing all the action, not the decaying part of old Vegas. 

Room service, however, was non-existant. We did not see them for 3 days. 5 star service it was not. Never cleaned the room (not that it was messy) but c'mon at least come in and vacuum, replace the towels and that jazz. Is that too much to ask???

The pool, again, was beautiful but if you get there after 10am in the summer, good luck finding a few chairs for your party unless you spring for a cabana. Frustrating for sure, not finding a place to lay out, but that's our fault for being late not the hotels (but, would it hurt to open up a few of the unsold cabana lounge chairs that NO ONE was using for 2 hrs??)

The restaurants were OK at best. Went to Wazuzu for lunch one day and Switch for dinner. Wazuzu was decent, but again we had a surly server, and Switch was just plain annoying after awhile. 

Never even made it to the casino. Our travel companion went down one night and said they charged him $14 for a drink while he was gambling. What casino in Vegas does that? Encore, that's who. 

All in all, I can't say that we had a great time and that we would stay again. Next time we'll just stick to the Venetian or the Palazzo. I would suggest you do the same too.",5,4,4

I swear I didn't want to leave and we stood for a week. You can definitely tell their is an emphasis on customer service and Steve Wynn knows how to deliver a wonderful experience to its customers. I'm planning another trip to Vegas next year and already know we will be staying at the Encore because its that good!

My friends and I decided to stay here because it was the new Hotel on the perfect side of the strip, plus we'd already stayed at The Palazzo, The Venetian, Caeser's Palace, Planet Hollywood, The Hard Rock, MGM, and Paris.  All of which were good if not great hotels. 

Our suite at Encore was ridiculously small for the amount we were paying (you can get double the size anywhere else).  But it was at the end of the hall where there was really only 1 room to the left of us.  .  We were in the room a total of maybe 3 hours before we went out to the club.  In those 3 hours we got 3 noise complaints because of the music that was playing while we got ready.  REALLY??? Again, who expects it to be QUIET in Vegas.  Then when 2 of my friends came back to the room early, they ordered room service that didn't come til about an hour and 15 minutes later, when they told them 45 minutes.  Then on top of that, the change didn't come until 2 hours later, when they said they would back up with in in 10 minutes.  So, I come back to the room at about 4:00 am, about an hour later a manager knocks on the door and tells us that 2 of us need to leave the room because we got another noise complaint!!  Really, seriously... I hate to say it again, but we're in VEGAS. Luckily, my friend's boyfriend had a room at Planet Hollywood so we just went over there.
I may be a little jaded thinking that most people party when they come to Vegas, but I don't think it's practical to actually try and get decent sleep at an early hour here.  I've been out to Vegas more times than I can even count and have never experienced anything like that before.  We were booked for two nights, but checked out the following morning and stayed the next night at The PALAZZO (BEST HOTEL IN VEGAS)!! 
The only good thing about Encore is its club XS.  It is a beautiful venue, but if you want an awesome Upscale hotel, that won't give you a hard time I would recommend any other hotel on that side of the strip (such as the Palazzo, The Venetian, or Caeser's Palace).",2,1,0

Starting with the negative: my second night of a 4 night stay I went to the club XS (sober) I felt my bag pulled on the dance floor, I look down and my bag was open (not easy to do) phone gone. Clearly a professional.. So yes this is club problem however it is how the hotel handled the situation.  I reported the incident immediately and first security guard was helpful, I filled out paperwork as well as drew on a map where I was located he said they take it very seriously especially because I was a guest at the hotel. So there I was thinking great they will check the cameras that night and maybe catch the guy... 
The next day 2 days I spent hours trying to follow up being sent from dept to dept.and physically asking employees in different depts. Even requesting the security manager to call me. He\/she never did. All I ended up finding out is that security says that they take the matter seriously but they don't check cameras for 48 hours..... Very disappointing. If they had said sorry it happens nothing we can do I would have accepted that but they were very misleading!!!!

Positives:
*very little smoking in casino- very surprising and love it
*restaurants are AMAZING at catering to food allergies (very impressed)
*very nice rooms
*beautiful pools
* room service is quick!

This would have been a 5 star experience even with my phone being stolen it's due to the run-a-round and time I wasted following up on the incident with employees being rude, not caring, or just not following through as presented they would that brings my experience to 3 stars",0,0,0

02\/18-02\/21

My bestfriend (cbooz.yelp.com)  and I are both born in February, the month of Lovers (but we are not lovers, don't get it twisted)
We decided to do something together considering we just turned the BIG TWO FIVE!! (well that's what he was telling all the cab drivers!)
What better place to celebrate, act a fool, and go balls to the wall than LAS VEGAS!!

We usually stay at the Palazzo, but this trip we wanted to do something different. The ENCORE did not disappoint!

GOOD: 
- My friend asks for a ""complimentary upgrade"" for our room. A 50 dollar tip later and we got one of the best views of the strip!! (along with an extra roll away bed and a refrigerator)
- The view. As you press the control button to open the curtains, the Strip is in plain sight. Gives you that ""This city is mine"" mentality.
- The room was so spacious. Four dudes in a suite requires lots of room (we need workout space, runway space, DANCE DANCE space...)

BAD:
- Getting to the rooms at the ENCORE can be confusing. Good thing the guys followed my lead. Otherwise they would always end up getting lost.
- I was the designated bartender that night. Mixing drinks left and right. Got a little too wasted. Remember telling my friend, ""you need to get on MY level. My Tolerance is waayy up here and yours is down there""

UGLY:
- As fast as the trip came, it ended so much faster. The weekend was a blur. Time really does fly when you are having fun!
- There's one pic that the four of us guys took that probably won't ever end up on the internet or at least we hope not!

There were numerous moments that I won't forget from that trip. From getting faded in the room, fist pumping, topless dancing (me), some guy throwing a footlong sandwich at another guys leg, then that guy kicking it 10 ft in the air, ""bandys"" and so much more! 

One moment that stood out was when ""Forever Young"" was playing.  It reminded us guys that no matter how old we get, we will always be Forever young at heart. That trip was a blast and I am glad to have done ""big thangs"" with the fellas.

Can I get an ENCORE? 

Most definitely yes!",12,17,13

I judge alot of hotel room by their bathroom and I love the bathroom. Roomy and gorgeous! Watching tv while brushing my teeth, heck yeah. An incentive to stand there and brush my teeth for the full 2 minutes, maybe more! Mini-Bar is hella expensive though...Staff there is top notched!

I really wish Wynn would offer a little more for their guests though. Ghetto as it may be...I still like getting freebies at these sort of resorts. I mean I got them staying at Venetian and it was soo much cheaper. 

I would definitely stay here again but so many more resorts to try before I decide on my favorite.",2,0,0

 The Dream bed is beyond belief.

Arranged for two online resort rooms (two Queens and one king).  Went when off peak summer rates started on June 2. Paid 339 for Thursday 424 for Fri, Sat. + 254 for Sunday. We invited a friend to join us so we tried to get two doubles daily one week before we left but due to convention Queens were gone.  That morning i called they said there were some Queens available at upgraded rooms but that we would have to request that at check-in and I could not secure it over the phone.  The woman at registration who helped us seemed pretty young, Briona.  I tried waiving a $50 bill in front of her to see if we could get a complimentary upgrade. We thought we had a chance since we were celebrating 2 bdays and when I had called that morning to check on the Queens they told us they were only at 50-60% capacity.   Disappointed to learn Briona offered no free upgrade but instead a comp cot since we were celebrating a bday (value $50 a night). Tried to see if we could upgrade at least one room to a tower suite because then you have access to the tower pool, exclusively for people staying in the towers. Stayed at Caesars palace and Mandalay bay and we know how crowded the pools can get so if you rent a space for one day with a couple of lounge chairs and an umbrella it is like $1000 so we thought it would be a good investment if we didn't get a comp upgrade to take advantage of any Wynn insider special that we could get (sign up at the Wynn website). Briona offered an upgrade to the encore parlor suite which is a step above the encore tower suite and usually $1000 a night for a discounted rate that averaged an addl $250 per night. We tried to get the room with two queens upgraded but the Queen suites were not available (which was sad since they told me that morn when I called that they were).  We upgraded the king and ask them to take the cot there. This gave us the chance to give a ""tower"" key to everyone in our party so they could go to the tower pool. We tipped Briona $25 (rather than 50) since we didn't get the upgrade but the free cot saved us $200 and we did get more than the regular 15% off of our room. She told us there was no need but we gave it to her for all the time she spent with us and she did go back a couple of times to speak to her ""manager"". I read about upgrades for people who were celebrating a bday in a month so if you don't get it don't feel compelled to tip, we were feeling generous.  There was lots of great stuff for tower people. First you have your own registration area with like 5-6 people working.   We didn't register there because we were ""resort"" people when we walked in, but we registered on a Thursday at 230 so there really was no line, unlike Fridays where it gets busy. In the tower registration we saw one person wait Friday and two on sunday, other than that no one waited. You have 1-2 personal concierge people there as well to make dinner reservations and answer your questions. You have your own entrance where you can have your cab or town car drive you to\/from the airport. They have their own bell men.  The rooms are as amazing as everyone else has reported on yelp. Our resort room was on the same floor so all we had to do was walk out the suite room and walk through a couple of doors (we were told you would need a key to enter the suites area from the other wing but you didn't) and we were three doors away from our resort room. The suite had a bedroom with a door separating the sitting area and two bathrooms with a massage room that we never used. An 80 min massage at the spa is $290 in the room it is $400.  It was nice but the resort rooms are pretty nice too, even though they don't have as much square footage. We had a refrigerator in the suite and they didn't. The suite was ready when we checked in and they told us they would text us when the resort room was ready so we just went to the suite, the bell man brought all the bags. We went to the family pool by the registration area.  You show your card and you are offered two towels each, a beer was $9.  The European pool was right behind it with only sculptured landscaping separating them. No security checking ID's.  The one at Caesar's was like Fort Knox.  They had a bar and plenty of gambling tables.  At night it is transformed to the outdoor part of a club (xs) so they remove the lounge chairs and bring in comfortable seating.  The resort room wasn't ready until around 7pm. Our daughter is a vegan, and unless you have a vegan family member you do not have any idea what it is like to brainstorm breakfast, lunch, and dinner when you are out of town. Every restaurant on the Wynn properties had amazing choices for vegans to include the Steve Wynn burger, French toast, pastas, and desserts galore. Chocolates were sent to our rooms the next day from Briona for each of the kids. About 70% of the employees were 5 star but we found 30% were not impressive.",0,0,0

I needed some shoes shined and called down to the Bell Desk at 5 a.m. and a person answered straight away and had someone come up to the room and pick up the shoes. When I returned the shoes were back in my room and had a shine on them like i've never seen before.

The hotel was beautiful but the experience was just so-so. First we checked in and went to our room , which we paid extra per night to upgrade to have a view, and when we got there our door wouldn't open. They sent a very unfriendly person to help us. The door was jammed. Once we got in we found that every time we needed to open it we would have to push or pull extra hard to get in. We were not offered a different room. The pool below us was blasting music at 9am and woke us up and continued all day and night. Was like being at the actual pool. Not very romantic for our honeymoon. Not once were we congratulated on our marriage even though my husband called weeks before to let them know why were there to be sure it was a flawless and magical honeymoon. This hotel did nothing above and beyond to help us celebrate or feel special. When a newly wed couple comes to Vegas over all other possible destinations, they expect a little more than your regular trip. This was very disappointing. The guards at the elevator NEVER smile when you pass them. We spend hours and lots of money gambling there each day and RARELY a had a cocktail server come by to serve us. We ended up going to the Mirage for gambling since they had many friendly servers available and our luck was much better there. Overall the hotel is just fancy-looking but the service and experience is poor. We are planning our next trip in the fall\/winter for our birthdays but will not return to this hotel.

The five star review comes with a caveat -- we stayed mid-week in the middle of the summer, so our king suite was just $200 a night -- a steal that must be done. *** Without the suite, my review would drop down to a 4.
Why 5-star?
1. The service is top-notch and we didn't have even to glance up to have people swarming us every second to ask if we needed anything. Check-in and check-out took five minutes.
2. The decor and layout are amazing. I'm not a fan of Jeff Koons but there was plenty of other art and cool stuff to look at (fountains, waterfalls, carousel -- even the carpet is pretty cool!) as you waltz through both the Encore and the Wynn, which are connected, and the adjoining high-end stores (Alexander McQueen, Louis Vuitton, Graff, etc.) that connect the two hotels.  It was fun to window shop!  
3. The room was just perfect: the Dream bed lives up to its reputation and now we're saving money to purchase this bed for ourselves so we can have this experience every night. We were on the 59th floor (definitely opt for a high floor if you can) and the sweeping views from the floor to ceiling windows kept us entertained at all hours.  The mini-bar was *fully* stocked (including a ""pleasure pack* -- yes!) but there was no coffee machine (understandably -- a waste of space - who drinks that stuff any more?). The wi-fi was pretty good, but not perfect.
4. The luxury here is the newness of the facility, the cleanliness (spotless mostly) and the amenities that are available. 
5. The pool is lovely and a much needed respite from the 106-degree heat. Definitely get there early to score chairs in the shade. They provide towels, ice water (yes!!) and while we were there, we got free grapes and bottled water.  If you're feeling spendy, there are killer cabanas available that surround the pool, where you have lounges set up and cool water sprayed into the cabana -- nice....also, you can reserve umbrellas and chairs inside the pool.
6. The casino was fun and not too smoky (compared to other hotels we went to) - we even won a little, so that was cool.  One of the slots I had let me play poker for 15 minutes on a dollar.
7. This is not a ""family-oriented"" resort (thank you!!), but rather a playground for adults. The restaurants clearly state that children under 5 are not allowed in the dining room.  For some reason, a lot of today's parents do not understand that children under five should NOT be allowed in a fine dining establishment, so this rule was MUCH appreciated.  As a result, there were no screaming kids anywhere in the resort. Excellent!

All this comfort costs money, so take some moulah!  Drinks inside were $12 each, at the pool - $15.  Double lattes + bagel + muffin = $25. Just a heads up!  Mostly, food was pretty good, although expensive for what you get. Our lunch at society cafe was good, but not great (my turkey ""pastrami"" sandwich was kind of gross even though the waitress had recommended it) but the best part was when the chef came out to discuss my husband's tree nut allergy (wow! didn't expect that) and we went to the Buffet for breakfast (all-you-can-eat - two of us - about $50) and the corn pancakes were ice cold and inedible, even though we arrived when the Buffet opened. I know...strange, but there it is.

***Part of the luxury besides the deal on the room mid-week was that it was not very crowded when we were there. Friday, it started to get a bit crowded, so I highly recommend staying during the week.

Would I stay here again?  Yes, provided we stay in a king suite. ;)",3,0,1

I had no problems checking in and getting a room right away early in the morning.  I was told I also got 1 free buffet per day.  When I checked out, this turned out not to be the case -- so minus one star for incompetent desk staff misleading me (I think she may have confused my offer for another offer?).  It would be two stars if management wasn't willing to meet me halfway, so that's something at least.  I suggest that you only follow what you've been given in writing, if you stay here.

Pros - Soundproofing from outside and from other rooms is very good;  Temperature regulation is great;  Much to my great shock, I did pretty well at the slots here (hey, it does make you feel better about the whole experience when you win); Generous selection of toiletries;  Blackout curtains were effective (would be even better if they overlapped a little at the center and didn't leave a small gap, though this is the case with 99% of hotels -- however THEhotel's curtains work this way, and I've seen it a few other times);

Meh - Room decor was not appealing for me, and I prefer when the bedroom is separate;  I'm normally not a buffet person (and can no longer eat more than a non-heaped plate or two) and while this is probably the nicest buffet in Vegas, I would never have paid for it for what they're asking, maybe half that, it was just okay, the menu did not really change from day to day, some items were tasty but many were not, or were cold or over- or undercooked, and most of the desserts were way way too sweet (and this is coming from a very devoted dessert fiend); Shower pressure and temperature (this was way better in their spa with the same equipment); Cell service not too good from inside room.

Cons - Wi-Fi was slow and unstable; soundproofing from out in the hall not so great -- and Saturday night was awful with people making noise out there all night and the room next door having a nasty screaming fight around 2 am (of course, this can happen anywhere); drugstore\/sundries shops are about as expensive as the minibar in your room (i.e. highway robbery); Bathroom seemed reasonably clean overall, but bath rugs were nasty and crunchy feeling, like they never get washed & mysterious black streaks on the bottles.

Le Reve was great, and it was awesome not having to pay to see it (and no issues on the billing on that front).  I would probably stay again if I got a similar deal and had someone to take up to Vegas with me next time.  Otherwise I will probably stay somewhere else more relaxing.  Encore (and Wynn) had much more of a loud party atmosphere than I expected, and that's not what I'm looking for.",2,0,0

The bathroom is BEAUTIFUL and the room was superb. Bring your bubble bath because the tub is spotless and welcoming. 

We stayed at Encore from Monday to Friday in room 5441 with a view of the mountains. Opened the drapes every morning with the push of a button from the bed. Called the front desk or housekeeping and they refer to you by name. 

I also enjoyed the Euro pool- topless of course. I have never gone topless in a public pool but I was in Vegas and they designed the pool for people to go topless. Don't worry, if you are not as bold they also have a family pool. 

One thing, get ready to pay for the luxury. A small bottle of vodka in the fridge in the room is $29. My husband went to the liquor store (3 minute walk) and got the same thing $12. The restaurants are also pricey but we were on vacation so we ate at each at least once. The yogurt with granola and fresh berries was my favorite ($11) at Society and the steak and eggs were good. My husband enjoyed the frittata and the frosted flake french toast   

I can honestly say that I enjoyed my stay at Encore and look forward to going back.",0,1,0

My first impression of the place wasn't great because of all the different valet locations they had. I literally had to hit all 3 until I got to the right one. They had one for the casino, one for the suites, and one for regular rooms. If you go straight back, you'll hit the self-parking garage.

We checked in Friday afternoon and were given many different options on rooms. We finally decided on a queen bed but at a higher level in the hotel. Everything was super high tech. From the controlled doorbell (instead of hanging up a do not disturb sign, just hit the privacy button and the do not disturb phrase will display by the doorbell), remote controlled lights and curtains, and the separate shower heads. 

Their beds were ultra comfortable. Double comforters?! It's like sleeping on clouds! Whenever my head touched the bed, I knocked out. One of the nights, I woke up at the foot of the bed. I think I fell asleep watching TV? Speaking of, their TV is awesome. You can turn it 360 degrees, so you can watch it in bed or on the couch in the living room. They have all the channels you'd ever need and they also had channels strictly for music. This was super convenient when we were getting ready to hit the clubs.

I was totally feeling the red, black, and white colors used throughout the hotel. The red chandeliers hanging in the casino added an interesting touch. I noticed the casino didn't have the usual cigarette stench. It was really clean and the air wasn't stuffy. 

They have two different pools. The main pool was family-friendly, whereas the european pool (21+) was off to the side where XS is at (which is THE Vegas club right now). We stuck to the main pool since it had more chairs. Drinks were expensive, but darn good. Get the Miami Vice if you want to get a good buzz going.

I'd recommend this hotel to couples or older people. Since it is at the end of the strip, it's not as popping as say Palazzo and Venetian. Their casino wasn't as busy as other casinos. All the celebrity sightings weren't bad too (Hugh Jackman, Usher, and David Spade). Encore is as good as it gets, everyone needs to experience this hotel at least once.",1,1,1

The music and base noise can be heard from our 9th floor room. Even worse were our neighbors who were smoking pot on non smoking floor who kept us up til 5am. We asked for room switch and initially were told no rooms were available. Hours later, the encore came through with a new room facing the strip and normal neighbors. Our keys were reprogrammed in seconds and we grabbed our stuff and went right to new room. Never had to go downstairs to check out. The process was amazingly quick and we thought it was customer service at its best. The employees there made you feel like royalty and truly worth commending.

Restaurants - nice but too expensive

Shopping - no way!  $250 for a pair of swim trunks!!

I don't see the difference between this resort's much higher price tag on everything compared to that of other Vegas hotels.  Except for the spa I was not impressed with the level of customer service through out the resort.  The Wynn & Encore boast their 5 star rating but I remain unimpressed.

If you are planning to visit Vegas, you must stay here! From the moment you walk in, the staff treats you like the king and queen of Zamunda. You won't get flowers at your feet or pesos with your face on it but a genuine smile and do appreciate your business.

Love the vibrant red colors, butterfly accents, and chill down tempo house music. Down to the gardens of flowers to the casino ceilings, extreme attention to detail is given throughout Encore. You feel ultimately cool just by staying here. 

Our suite was just as glamorous and sexy. We had an amazing view of the Wynn and the strip. No outside food or drinks are allowed, only purchases from the Wynn and Encore. Room service is available all day or even try one of restaurants they have to offer.

When you walk through the lobby, guests have immediate entry to the pool area. There are two separate pools, one for families and conservative guests and the European pool is for the 21+ and topless sunbathers. I got distracted by the ebony statue who was swimming laps. Anyways, for the freek-a-leeks, cameras are not allowed in this area. The waitress are very attentive and the staff works hard to keep this area neat and organized.

Rooms are beautiful, nicely appointed (though I agree with the reviewer who noted that Wynn really cheaped out by not allowing you to even use the refrigerator without a fee). Soap and amenities are nice, not fabulous. Bed is to die for and I love the curtains that you can operate from the bed. Rooms are clean and comfortable with lots of drawer space. The staff is nothing short of spectacular and accommodating: they get 5 stars. 

Now..the not so nice:  Initially we were put into a room overlooking the adult pool area and night club. Most of the day and night, despite being on the 26th floor, we were subjected to the bass thump. Most annoying. We mentioned it to the concierge who mentioned it to someone and they moved us to a North-facing suite. Delightful. But seriously, anyone who overlooks the pool will suffer through the techno-beat in the daytime as well as at night. Also, Wynn is clearly trying to attract the young, trust-funder or otherwise Red-Bull-fueled, trucker-hat-wearing, recently-rich crowd with lots of money and absolutely no class. I mean, I enjoy a drink (or more) and a good time but this crowd was so bad the hotel personnel had to apologize for their behavior to other, less inebriated clientele. I felt bad for the staff having to put up with their behavior while still being polite. And I hate to think of the mess they must leave in the rooms. Eww. I can understand wanting that demographic to blow their parents' money or their recently earned tech\/oil\/etc money in your hotel, but really can they not have an ""adults only"" experience? And I don't mean x-rated, but you know, adult.

It's perfectly true and I'm not mistaken when I say -- that Stephen A. Wynn consistently raises the bar with every subsequent property he introduces to the world famous Las Vegas Strip.

Let's take a jog down memory lane to familiarize ourselves with this man's accomplishments in Sin City, shall we?

1989 - Mr. Wynn's The Mirage resort opens.  It's the most expensive hotel and casino project ever built at the time at a cost of $630 million (keep in mind, this was '89).  The Mirage is often considered the grand-daddy of today's Las Vegas, for igniting the building boom trend of themed mega-resorts and jump-starting tourism back into Sin City at a time where Atlantic City was becoming the hot gambling mecca in America. Way to turn the tables back around!

1993 - Steve compliments The Mirage with a similar tropical-themed sister resort right next door: Treasure Island.  Featured the first free strip-front live entertainment show and a unique theme that brought kids and their parents in, during a period when Vegas as a whole was appealing to families.

1998 - Opulence and modern luxury is born on the Vegas strip with the most expensive hotel and casino built (again) at the time.  Wynn's magnificent $1.6 billion Bellagio resort heralded in a new era of posh and exclusivity to the strip that 11 years later, is still unmatched by a majority of properties in town.

2005 - After selling off his interests and ownership of his previous properties, he takes the money from the sale and sinks it into what Vegas junkies and visitors now know as Wynn Las Vegas.  Taking the ultra-luxury concept of his Bellagio resort and magnifying it two-fold, his $2.7 billion dollar baby is so influential that room rates elsewhere on the strip are priced accordingly to the rates set here.

Late 2008\/TODAY - Ah. Here we are. To the topic at hand.

ENCORE.

and the color RED.

Now, I haven't stayed at this hotel as a guest, YET. This is mainly a review of the casino and its public areas, which I've had the delight of enjoying.

The first thing I noticed when my eyes took in the grandeur of this hotel's casino was how BOLD and DAZZLING the decor it is. The color red (and other 154 color-palette variations of it) is splashed EVERYWHERE. From the detailed butterfly-print carpeting to the lavish wall drapes, from the lighting fixtures to even the outfits worn by some of the resort employees. RED RED RED.

It's the polar opposite of the typical gorgeous, but rather vanilla casino  that you'd experience at The Palazzo or Bellagio. Though very elegant, Encore's decor is so loud, that you might just want to put on those shades hanging on the front of your shirt.

Encore takes design cues from her sister hotel with unrestrained use of glass EVERYWHERE. This results in natural light filtering into the casino and public areas, which lends to a very ""airy"" and calming environment. A big stark contrast to casinos like at The Mirage, where you feel like you're betting money inside a dark, monstrous cavern.

Suspended intermittently from the low and intimate ceilings in each of the four gambling quadrants are stunning (and extremely expensive) elaborate hand-blown glass murano chandeliers, custom tailored with a unique color --- Wynn ""tulip,"" created specifically for this casino. I toured a well-known hand-blown glass manufacturer and dealer (specialized mostly in chandeliers) on a trip to Venice last December, and a custom chandelier of similar size easily ran over $20,000 A PIECE (a light fixture that costs as much as a brand new car!). There are more than 179 of those floating around in the Encore casino alone. Now do the math. No expenses have been spared here, people.

Just a testament to how much effort they put into the ""show"" of this place, as I strolled through the Encore shopping esplanade, I was taken aback to see a resort employee on a miniature forklift vacuuming the dust off the leaves on one of the indoor palm trees lining the walkway. WTF? That's attention to detail, to the EXTREME.

The casino floor here isn't very big. It's got more of a boutique vibe to it, where a smaller and more intimate gambling experience was envisioned and executed, as opposed to a massive sprawling casino floor that stretches on for what seems like miles (like @ MGM Grand).

I love new casinos. All of their slots were high-tech and spiffy, with those little LCD screens that displays slot club information and point balances and were a lot more engaging and interesting to play.

Cocktail waitresses are extremely friendly, quick to bring your drink, and part you with a smile. Can't say the same about the wenches at The Venetian casino.

It also doesn't hurt to credit this casino that I won $200 after a few spins at a 5 cent reel machine. :)

Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to stay as a guest here in the near future.",11,7,6

Encore lives up the the hype of our first experience with the Wynn. We stayed in an upgraded King suite and the room and linens were of premium quality and the flat screen HD tv was nice. The room was the nicest I've been in in Vegas. 

The housekeeping service was prompt and courteous. The employees were all courteous and helpful. The only negative was that the tv remote was not working when we arrived (but was quickly replaced by housekeeping) and the line to the front desk was busy and went to voicemail. 

The casino felt smaller than some of the other highend casinos on the Strip and they did not have their own poker room so we had to go to the Wynn which wasn't a big deal but something to keep in mind.",2,2,1

Some of the best restaurants and best night clubs in the world are in this hotel. You will not find many families with kids here, this hotel is for the singles and couples without children folks. XS and Surrender and Encore Beach Club are the night\/day clubs here and if you have ever been to any of them you know that they have some of the best parties in Vegas. The amenities at Encore are outstanding, the pool is luxurious, the suites are large and spacious, the golf course is amazing(from what I've heard) and the view from the rooms is breathtaking!
 
However, I have one gripe, which probably was a one time thing, I'm hoping.  I had reserved a double queen suite for Memorial Day Weekend two months in advance, but when I got there to check in they told me they gave my room away and it was ""first come first serve"". You can just imagine how pissed off I was. I'm not paying $400 per night to argue with the hotel front desk about what I reserved and what they think I reserved. I even showed them the email confirmation that showed I reserved a double queen suite(the regular single queen suite is almost half the size of a double queen suite and costs $50 less per night). The girl at the front desk and her manager refused to acknowledge that the single queen suite was $50 less and obviously played dumb. After some arguing, I finally convinced them to knock off the $50 per night. At that point it was all about principle. If you are going to give away my room that I reserved 2 months in advance the least you can do is give me the correct price of the smaller room? For a Five star hotel, the front desk employees should be able to recite the pricing on the website from memory. The next day a double queen suite opened up and we moved to the new room which was much much more spacious, which is why I reserved it in the first place. 

Other than that misunderstanding(it was the busiest weekend of the year), the Encore is top notch and I would stay there again just because it is one of the three nicest hotels in Vegas, hands down!!  One thing I forgot to mention, if you are staying there and want to party at Encore or Surrender or EBC, just talk to the concierge and ask if you can get tickets.  Most of the time those parties are sold out, but if you are staying at the hotel you get privileges!  Also, if you don't get one of the high end suites, I highly recommend the double queen suite.  It has so much more room and square footage than a king suite.",2,1,1

You can officially called me spoiled after my 5 day stay at the Encore. Ive been to a few other casinos on the strip and the Encore is simply the best.

Our check-in on Monday was flawless. The entire Wynn and Encore staff is top notch often calling you by name. Our room a Deluxe King Suite was as usual spectacular with over 600 square feet of space. On this trip we decided to take advantage of what the Encore has to offer...

During our stay my wife and I dined at the Society cafe for dinner and Tableau for breakfast. All the food was amazing! They now offer vegan specialties if you want to eat healthy. Yes, the prices are high but this is a boutique resort so you have to expect it.

My wife also had the opportunity to use the salon and spa. She couldn't stop raving about it. She was in Heaven! So much so that she practically begged me to use the spa which I did. Its spectacular and a great place to recover after a night of partying on the strip.... A MUST go if you are a guy or a gal.

We also had a chance to use the pool. There is a public area and a European area for adults. We chose the European side at its sunnier and quieter. The pool is perfect and just the right temperature. Very relaxing if the spa hasn't done that already.

Lastly I want to thank some of the staff that helped us during our stay as they made our week...Alexis in Tableau who made the reservation for my wife, Garrett in Concierge who helped us with Jubilee tickets, Ashely by the pool who took good care of us, Vin at the bar who pours a mean Scotch and the countless other staff who made us feel special.

First, the Encore is a beautiful building both inside and out.  Upon walking in you immeadiately feel classy and begin to walk with more swagger, because this place is just that baller.

Next, they have the best staff in Vegas.  Dealers, cocktail waitresses, cashiers, bartenders, everyone treats you with the utmost respect and courtesy.  They treat you great even if you happen to be incredibly lit up, and since this is often my last stop after a night of raging in vegas (I often hit up the Wynn between the hours of 3am-7am), I am often quite wasted when I come through here.

This place is also always crawling with beatiful women; early in the morning, late at night, and everytime in between, so you know that's a good thing.

Finally, on my last Las Vegas adventure I won a bunch of money on one of their craps tables late night that made up for some losses I'd took earlier in the trip.

The whole suite can be managed by your bedside i-pad like station (closing curtains, turning on lights, etc.). High tech for a hotel room. I love staying here because it feels more like a high end boutique hotel, rather than a huge, ultra modern city like Aria. We did prefer the pool at the Wynn and went there instead (a little walk through the lobby- not bad) because it was more relaxing than the European or general pool at Encore. We loved our visit and will definitely stay here again!",0,0,0

I unfortunately left behind needed medication in my bedside table and called on my way to the airport in Las Vegas. No help. I then called 5 additional times and was shocked to be told they are not there. I then got angry and guess what happened, they somehow found them. Now I need to fill out Lost and Found form on line and pay $15.00 to have these medications returned, I do not mind paying the $15.00 but after spending in excess of one hour trying to fill out an electronic form that will not send electronically, I decided to just give up.  i have never reviewed a business on yelp and always thought poorly of those that did but I find I am at my whits-end.  I called again today to ask if I could email the information and again, they didn't know. All for medication. Steve Wynn, do you know this is how your staff treats your guests? I have stayed at the Encore many times but this hotel has dropped to the bottom of my list. Please, don't ever leave anything in your Encore Hotel room, you will never see it again.

We had the Encore Resort King Suite (I think that's what it was called). 745 sq ft for $191 a night (plus fees and taxes of course) was a pretty good deal. The robes were comfy, the bed was soft, the pillows were great, the decor was nice, and no noise from any of the clubs or other rooms reached us (we were 20 floors up). The view of the north part of the strip was amazing as well. A big plus was the bathroom - double vanity, separate closet-sized room for the toilet (in case things get smelly), and a separate tub and shower. Points for the bathtub being big enough for me and the boyfriend. We're tall people and don't take baths often because we simply don't fit in most bathtubs.

The casinos are fun and clean. Unlike other casinos we went to that smelled like stale corn and old cigarette butts, the Encore and Wynn casinos didn't have any stench (smoking is only allowed on the casino floor, so the smoking stops where the carpet ends). 

We also enjoyed the pool and hot tub while we were there (the resort fee is mandatory so you might as well enjoy it). The pools are heated, so it's not like you're dipping into an ice bath. The hot tub is a fun spot to relax and loosen the muscles. One of the pools there is also topless, for the folks out there who want an even tan all over.

The place is beautiful, and we had so much fun there and on the Strip we were tempted to book another night.

There are few downsides that are mostly me being picky, so I'm not downgrading the star-rating:
 - The food is hella expensive. Had we stuck to eating all our meals at the hotel, we would've spent over $100 on food each day. I spent $25 on a breakfast that back home would've cost me $14.
 - The couch in the room irritated my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin, so the dry air plus the scratchy couch left parts of my hands dry, red, and flaky. This isn't the hotel's fault, just me and my crappy genetics.
 - There was some confusion regarding the internet usage. I assumed that any kind of wifi speed (there are different levels of wifi speed) I used was covered by the resort fee, but at check-out, I was told only the basic was covered. I told them I wasn't made aware of this, and said the most I'd be willing to pay was the price difference, but not the full freight. They ended up comping the whole thing, which was nice. 

Everyone there was friendly and if I go to Vegas again, I'm definitely booking my stay there.",0,0,0

The staff said they had found them  but instead of turning them into the lost and found left them on their cleaning cart and another staff member must of took them because we never got them back.

Overall, I would return if I wanted a luxury stay in Vegas again. The property is nicely decorated, more light and modern than for example the Venetian next door.

The rooms here are large, quite nice and polished. We had an issue with the water pump in the toilet running continuously, which was quickly fixed by a technician. I'd also say that the shower controls were just a bit difficult. Aside from that, everything was great in our 63rd floor room facing north, with an expansive view away from the Strip. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and there was plenty of room for two to spread out. Nice automated curtains for the floor to ceiling window.

Why not a Strip-facing room you ask? Well, our first room was facing that way - and as a result, right above a very noisy outdoor night club blaring music until 4am. As far as I'm concerned, in a 5-star resort there should not be rooms with this much sound intrusion at that hour. We ended up switching to the other side of the tower. Unless you enjoy loud noise when trying to sleep, heed the warning from the desk clerk and insist on a north facing room. I've gotta knock a star off for this.

The pool was nice - options for families and also an adults-only, top-optional-for-the-ladies pool. Aside from slightly intrusive music, I enjoyed my swim. The location of the hotel is the north end of the Strip, but there is plenty to see nearby and the crowd in this particular part of the Strip is a bit less annoying than other areas to the south.

Service was generally good, prompt and courteous as I would expect at this price point. I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars mostly because the issues we did have were addressed fairly promptly (the room switch required some nudging and a $35 upgrade fee though).",1,0,0

To be honest, I prefer staying on this side of the strip, as it's close to the mall and many of the clubs\/restaurants that I really enjoy going to. Wynn\/Encore is located right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall and next to the Venetian\/Palazzo. Encore is the newer tower of Wynn.

My absolute favorite hotel on the street is the Palazzo. The parking garage at Wynn and Encore is small and confusing. The service, in my experience, hasn't been as pleasant even though they go out of their way to attempt to say your last name at every place you go to in here and print your name on your room key card. Decor wise, I would say it's most like the Bellagio. All rooms are suites, and if you are facing the strip, you may be able to hear noise from the clubs downstairs even if you're on the 23rd floor.

Despite all this, this is a truly beautiful, clean, and wonderful hotel. If you're looking for luxury on the strip, this is definitely one of the best hotels to stay.

It is evident that there is A LOT of attention to detail.  Every member of the staff is very attentive and friendly--housekeepers, wait staff, front desk, managers, etc.  This would be impressive at any resort casino but it's particularly impressive when you consider the sheer size of the Encore.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that Encore (and Wynn) seems to suffer from the same problem that all casino resorts suffer from--lines\/long waits for services.  Our room wasn't ready at check in time and we called for ear plugs (Beach Club was right below our room) and it took about an hour, and two requests, for them to be brought up.  But again, the staff was friendly.

The crowd is posh but also trendy and entitled.  Snookie\/Carrie Bradshaw wannabes and d-bag guys.  Guy we met at the pool: ""Dude, you gotta come to XS tonight! There's going to be this DJ who's so DOPE!!!""  But not everyone.  Our trip was 4 gay guys: 2 friends and a gay couple.  The couple held hands and occasionally kissed while walking around but we never ran in to any problems though.  The upside of it being a bit of a posh crowd is that we didn't see a lot of the people wearing plastic yard cups around their necks.  That's also related to the fact that it's at the north end of the Strip.  The plastic yard cup wearers seem to be more down near Harrah's and Imperial Palace.

Encore is a great destination resort; if you wanted to, you could easily stay within the Wynn\/Encore resort the entire time.  It's expensive to do that though.  There really are no inexpensive dining options in the complex.  Our cheapest meal was 2 slices of pizza and 2 Cokes for $22.  But if you just accept that it's going to be expensive, then you could spend your entire vacation there if you wanted to.

Overall, it's on the expensive side but it's worth it.  We had a great stay!",1,1,2

My bf and I checked in at 4pm on Labor Day without a wait or a hitch, though they did try to upsell a suite on a higher floor for an additional $20\/day. We passed and were not disappointed with our room on the 16th floor in the slightest. 

I have a 5 am internal alarm clock and slept til 2 pm each day no problem thanks to the black out curtains and QUIET. I heard a door slam maybe twice and the faint sound of a hairdryer in another room once but that was it. The room was a bit warm when we first arrived but quickly cooled when we adjusted the room's temperature. Everything is electronically controlled from the privacy feature to the curtains covering the floor to ceiling windows. The amenities in the room are great! Loved their shampoo\/conditioner\/shower gel set which lasted the two of us our entire stay. 

Since our $20\/day resort fee covered wireless internet and access to the fitness center I worked out once and was impressed with the number and variety of cardio and weight machines. They provide water and towels, too. Out of the two pools we frolicked in, I liked the European pool best just because of the crowd and the fact that there was a poolside bar. (The other pool has a cocktail server.)

We had originally planned on seeing O at the Bellagio but it was sold out all three nights we were there (note: book your tickets ahead of time!) so we ended up seeing Le Reve at the Wynn Theater.... IT WAS PHENOMENAL! We sat in the 2nd row where tickets were only $99 compared to the rest of the seats. We were so close we could reach out and touch the performers if we wanted. Didn't have a problem seeing a thing. The show was the highlight of our trip and worth every penny. By the way, the Encore concierge was a huge help! They booked our dinners and shows and checked us in for our flights as well as printed out our boarding passes.

My only complaint? Room service stinks food-wise. Dropped $80 for a salad, fries, and two entrees. Service was quick, the food was nicely presented and hot upon arrival, but the texture and taste was really disappointing. Well, except for the fries but it's hard to screw those up. The Caesar salad had WAY too much dressing on it and the pasta was mushy (overcooked) and bland. Spaghettios would've been a better fix than what they served me! I added the meatballs for $6. They gave me three which were large but tasted horrible and were thus inedible. The Wynn Buffet was just okay, too. We went for dinner on a weeknight and it was like $75 for the two of us. The lamb, mashed potatoes, and desserts were  my favorite there.My bf of course liked the prime rib and alaskan crab legs. 

My dining recommendations? If you can, grab a drink at Parasol Down in the Wynn and get the White Sangria. They were pricey at $13 per glass, but SO GOOD and gave me a decent buzz. Botero Steakhouse is beautiful. We had after-dinner drinks and dessert here one night. The chef's ice cream selection was AMAZING but the chocolate souffle was a flop. I LOVE chocolate souffle's and didn't care for this one at all. There was no chocolatey lava center..... Finally, take advantage of your location to the Fashion Mall. They have TONS of less expensive food options for breakfast and lunch. We ate at CPK for lunch one day and stocked up on Ketel One and cranberry juice at the ABC Store to drink in our room and fill up our flasks. We splurged on our dinners and my absolute favorite was Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak in the MGM Grand. It was a $20 cab ride each way but it was SO WORTH IT.

With that in mind, I think it's very fair to compare the two. Just got home last night from a 4 day\/3night stay at Encore and I can't rave enough about this hotel. First off, YOU GOTTA LOVE RED  and Asian art if you are even going to step foot in Encore. It comes off as a high-end European hotel with MAJOR eastern influeneces. The casino is considerably smaller than Wynn and feels like it too, much more comfortable without the high empty ceilings and wide open spaces. The slots were pretty loose and tables were cheaper in the daytime (but that's stardard practice). The walk to and from Wynn was not that bad...it takes 5 minutes walking at a slow pace, unless you're walking through when XS is open. Then it takes a few more seconds to make your way through the masses. 
On to the rooms, loved the room it self far better than a Tower Deluxe King, but the view from Bellagio (and the bathtub) was better. That's the only thing, though. As we entertained a couple of friends who live in Vegas, it was great to have the seperate sitting room.  The bed was amazingly soft and the Egyptian linens were very nice, almost as nice as the slippers and chocolate from turndown service. I have to agree with the comments about this place being romantic, but it does help when you're there during AVN\/AEE weekend (oh and that other show in town, CES). Checkout was a little weird, the express checkout still doesn't work yet, also the recent cold spell before X-mas knocked out the heating coils in the pool (who wants to swim in January though), but those were the only times that I witnessed any flaw in how the the hotel operates, one of which was completely out of their control. The staff were incredible, always making sure that we have everything you need and that you are enjoying yourself. OK, so to compare Bellagio and Encore: I loved Bellagio, for it is a great resort in a great location in Vegas. Encore though is taking the best of the Pacific Rim and put it into the Ritz-Carlton.

Casinos were dead, pools close early and nightlife was not happening while I was there.

I'm having a tough time understanding how this could be a top rated resort - I can quickly, easily think of 5 properties that blow the Encore\/Wynn out of the water, but maybe Vegas just isn't my thing.

so one of the girls staying with us was being followed from some drunk person all the way from XS to our room 
that person was standing at the door and refusing to leave , so we called security to come and remove him 
once we called them , the person left , so we called security again and canceled . however security still came up to make sure everything was okay (which was nice)

however what wasn't nice is how rude and so unprofessional those people are.
they forced them self to get into the room (5 guys) without giving the girl in there (who happen to be changing ) a chance to put her clothes on !!!!

then the started talking about how the room smell like Marijuana (we are in smoking room) so we explained to them that we did not smoke any Marijuana in the room , only normal cigarettes , and we explained to them that this Marijuana was purchased for medical reason (we had prescription and medical card) and also please note that Marijuana can be purchased legally by anyone who is 21 and old in Las Vegas now 

the rude security guy (who is manager i guess and refused to give us his name) insist that we did smoke it in there , so i explained to him again we only smoke normal cigarettes as its smoking room , and then if there is any Marijuana smell in the room its because the sick person have medical and legally purchased Marijuana  on him 

then the security guy said we will have to take the Marijuana or we will kick you out the room (that was his exact words) so they took $145 worth of Marijuana , and they never gave it back when we left !!

so i am wondering who those people think they are to come to our room and take someone medication and not give it back !! they can't even take it 
we had very bad time in Vegas as the person with us was extremely un-comfortable without his medication

If you've stayed at the Wynn before, expect the same level of top notch service, quality, and amenities. But is it the best? Not quite...

If you didn't like the Wynn's pumpkin colored rooms, you'll find Encore a much more inviting place to indulge in, with a chic cream\/black interior offset. The rooms are beautifully furnished with furniture pieces that exude modern luxury. Tasteful yet inviting.  While I liked how the bed and living areas are sectioned off by a ""wall"", it does make the room feel smaller and less airy. Still, I love the high class interior. 

The bathroom, while large, was a bit of a disappointment. It's very vanilla when compared to the amazing attention to detail and sense of opulence found inside the Venetian\/Palazzo. It seems Wynn had to cut corners here cause it's rather lacking. Worse, our room had a loose shower handle which would droop lower, causing the water to get progressively hotter. Yikes! And the gap between the glass shower door allows water to seep through, creating a big puddle of water on the floor!

That said, Encore is all about beauty, elegance and class. It's not as big as Wynn which is fine by me. Not quite sure what the hotel is trying to be with the casino floors flushed out in red and other contrasting colors sprinkled throughout , but the rooms are nice. Service is excellent. The pool is small compared to Wynn's.  I also liked gambling here - it's relaxing, spacious, and I've done well here...oddly enough I seem to lose at the Wynn. And getting into the XS club was the most hassle-free... that's epic coming from a guy!

But is it the best hotel? Not quite. I still consider the Palazzo the new standard to beat and it takes the cake for best hotel in terms of overall room luxury, amenities, and value (size). But for overall experience, Encore is great.

I could of sworn I even saw butterflies inside the urinals at the men's room. 

We stayed at the King Resort Suite and it was great. Coming from someone who's only stayed at Monte Carlo and Flamingo, this place was like the Lobster of seafood. From now on, when I mention greatness I will say ""now that's lobster"". Bathroom, awesome (includes a glass shower room that will keep heat in forever, a bathtub that will fit two people or one very fat man, and a flat screen TV to watch your stories). Bedroom, awesome. I believe the thread count of the sheet were a billion. Living room with remote controlled shades, awesome. $5.00 powerade in the mini-fridge, not so awesome, but what do you expect. I had a great view of the strip on the 34th floor, and a nice view of the sad peasants that walked below my palace. (side effects from staying at Encore: Sense of superiority and a sudden feeling of ""godliness"")",2,5,3

He practically built modern-day Vegas, setting the new standard for luxury accomodation, starting with The Mirage hotel in 1989. Since then, he has raised the bar continuously - and he topped all his previous creations with the Wynn and the Encore. 

As a guest at the Wynn or Encore, you'll understand why they are consecutive Five Diamond award winners. Five Diamond properties are ""establishments that reflect the characteristics of the ultimate in luxury and sophistication; accommodations that are first class; the physical attributes extraordinary in every manner."" 

And like the Five Diamond award suggests, nothing at the Wynn\/Encore is ordinary. Their chefs are award-winners recruited from all over the U.S. and Europe, service is impeccable, the decor is stunning, and they have retailers that are a shopper's dream (if you have the money for it) like Steve McQueen, Chanel, Rolex and Gucci. They even have the largest Ferrari dealership in the country on site. What?! I could only afford to window shop, but it was nice to look :)

The pools are impressive, too. From the club-vibe of the Encore Beach Club to the serene lap pool and European dipping pool, the hotel has different areas that create different experiences depending on what you're looking for. I wish I were still there, sitting poolside and sipping on a coconut mojito :( 

The rooms are spacious (I'd say approx. 650 sq. ft) with expansive windows, remote controlled drapes, and a twirling flat screen TV so you can watch in the livingroom or your bedroom. Even the bathroom is huge. The bed is super soft and comfy. And don't even get me started on the buffet. There are food stations representing every corner of the world. And the dessert room - Oh Emm Gee. I was so happy to find sugar-free cheesecake and pecan pie that I could stuff my face with and feel (a little) less guilty. They cleverly place the dessert room at the entrance so you're forced to walk through it. 

I absolutely loved my stay here. Writing about it makes me sad! I want to go back.",10,6,7

I guess the demand in January is low so our weekend 2 night stay cost us $300+tax+resort fee but included 2 tickets to see Le Reve and 2 brunches at the Wynn Buffet. Another bonus are the separate lines for hotel guests for Surrender and XS.

The bed was really comfortable. Too comfortable perhaps, because I passed out almost the entire weekend. The room was huge and had a beautiful view of the Wynn and the bathroom was large as well.

But little things did bug me a bit. 1) The bathroom is poorly designed for drainage and every time we took a shower or turned on the bath tub's faucet, water was everywhere. 2) Housekeeping didn't give us new lotion\/shampoo\/conditioner the second day even though we had used more than half of the bottle of lotion the first day. Good thing I tracked down a girl who gave me enough lotion for the next 3 weeks. 3) The TV remote stopped working the second day. 4) We had to pay the resort fee even though the pool was closed for the season.

Anytime you need your room made-up there is even an option on the door panel inside so housekeeping won't be banging on your door or barging into your room. The bathroom is really nice & pretty ginormous you even have a TV in there which is a good & bad thing for me since I take a long time to get ready haha. I also appreciate that they're not shiesty w\/ the bathroom toiletries & provide nice products.

The pool is super nice too & I like that there is a guest elevator so you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the pool. I went to the pool everyday & loved that it was not overly crowded or swarming w\/ screaming children. I like the service they provide poolside as well, the mojitos are delish & not watered down like most pool bars. There's also a European pool so if tanning topless is your thing then it's there for you.

I love the nightclubs at the Wynn & Encore. Also since we were hotel guests we got into Blush w\/ no cover or waiting in line. So definitely take advantage of that if you stay here!

Mostly comfy...but for a hotel that bills itself as top of the line, there were lots of glitches. The 1st room they gave us had hair in the wash basin, hair on the pillows, toilet paper in the toilet, and visible stains on the sofa. They moved us to another room, and that one also had hair in the wash basin...hmmm.
View of the strip from the 51st floor were nice (we paid for the panoramic room upgrade). Room was spacious and comfy.
One annoying thing is they don't let you use the fridge in the room for your own items...we were warned that if you disturb any of the contents (either remove or add) that it might trigger a bar charge (from weight change sensors I guess).
Didn't like the fact that the hotel doesn't have adequate non-smoking areas in the casino or pathways to your room...so not a good choice for non-smokers like us. Also, there are better restaurant and shopping choices closer to the City Center\/Bellagio area and the Wynn\/Encore is a little out of the way.

I would give this a 5 star review but our room was smaller than i was anticipating. I got suite with two queens and a corner couch and i was comparing it to Palazzo and Palazzo had a much better layout, it was bigger, and had a cool sunken area where the couch went. With that being said almost everything else is nicer here at the Encore. This hotel is beautiful. 

Encore is expensive but ive learned why it is worth staying here. They have 3 of the coolest clubs in Las Vegas. XS, Surrender, Tryst to a lesser extent. We stayed here for a bachelor party, and since we were guest we went to concierege and paid for our tickets there. around 10:30 all 5 of us GUYS walked right past the GIGANTIC line and walked right into the club, absolutely no wait!!! It was awesome! The other way you save money is that you dont have to take expensive cab rides getting from your hotel to Encore or Wynn, And you also dont have to take the annoying cab ride after the club. The convenience to drink up, walk down stairs, walk right into the club, then walk right back upstairs was so nice. I cannot stress it enough. If you factor in transportation, Bribing the bouncer (for an all guy party) and paying more for drinks because you dont have them convenienctly upstairs) then you end up paying about the same as staying at a cheaper casino. Think about it and enjoy!

Life is good.  Life is really damn good.

You know life is good when you can book an impromptu getaway to the Encore resort.

I mean, this resort is so freakin' beautiful and comfortable, it makes you smile from ear to ear, starting at the moment you walk in.  Everything from the tastefully appointed casino, to the gardens, to the peacock statues, to the gorgeous bars and lounges decked out in sumptuous reds and browns -- it's all a feast for the eyes -- more so than most Vegas hotel\/casinos.

Encore gets it (mostly) right from the start.  Even the parking is easy, with a large and spacious parking garage that's easy to access and lands you right at the check-in desk.  Unfortunately, the check-in line takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get through, since the desk is perpetually understaffed.  

Our 19th-floor ""resort suite"" room was lovely.  Probably the most beautiful hotel room I've had the fortune of staying at.  The living room had a magnificent Strip view, which the photos don't do justice to.  The electronic shades\/blinds covering the floor-to-ceiling windows and the flat-screen TV in the shower were so unnecessary (but awesome!) that I felt like I was on a Bravo reality show.  The bedding was easily the finest, thickest, plushest bedding I've encountered at a hotel -- and I say that as someone who's admittedly very fussy about that sort of thing.  The bathroom looked beautiful but had a few plumbing issues (i.e., water backing up in the shower).  These issues were never resolved but were also never serious enough to interfere with our stay.

A tip: The Wynn\/Encore hotel bathroom give you freebie bottles of the Desert Bambu bath products, which are the most delicious and heavenly products you'll encounter.  Steal them!  Take them home!  Better yet: tip a housekeeper and see if he or she will give you extra!  Desert Bambu is not available in any store, except for the in-house Wynn\/Encore boutiques, where you'll be overcharged for them.

A warning: do NOT touch the tray of temptation.  If you even displace any of the snack bar\/tray items for even a few seconds, you'll be charged $8 for a couple Swedish fish.  Yes, they're on a weight sensor.  The Wynn\/Encore will find every possible way to nickel-and-dime you, so I repeat -- do NOT touch the tray of temptation.

Rooms aside, the Wynn\/Encore complex is superb because you never really have to leave.  The pool is stunning, and it has a dedicated access elevator for hotel guests.  (There's even a ""European pool"" if you're into seeing twice as many exposed areolas than you would at the regular pool.)  The selection of restaurants is probably the best on the Strip.  (We tried the Buffet and SW Steakhouse and loved both.)   For entertainment, there's a handful of nightclubs (XS and Surrender) as well as a dayclub (Encore Beach Club).  The point is: if you get bored at Encore, there's something seriously wrong.

With so many delicious hotel options on the Strip, it's often hard to choose.  Take it from me, though: you can't go wrong with the Encore.",19,10,9

It was Friday night. We were supposed to go to the Marquee nightclub to see some DJ we had tickets for, but we had gone to Tao the night before and were not in the mood.

We went to Encore casino around 4 am. Besides all the drunk people leaving the nightclubs, the casino itself was fairly dead.

We played slots. A cute cocktail waitress came up and asked us if we wanted a drink
Yes please! I ordered a margarita. She came back shortly with a tasty cocktail.
I tipped her, and we continued to play various machines.

Before I was even done that drink, another  waitress came by and offered me another drink. This time I ordered a White Russian. I was running out of small bills ( which I wanted to use to tip her) so I put in 20$ in the machine. I spun once and cha- ching ! I won. I cashed right out. $70.  Got my drink, tipped the waitress and left - ahead of the game. 

We walked around the casino and hotel and took photos. It's really nice and high end like the Wynn 

Next time I am in Vegas, I'm sure I will be back.",0,0,1

The beds are very comfortable, perfect for a good sleep after nonstop late night fun in Vegas.

The Encore casino never gets crazy crowded, but if you want more hype, the Wynn hotel casino just next door is definitely more happening.  After walking along the strip one late evening, past all the craziness near Harrah's, Imperial Palace, etc, it was nice to return to the Encore's laid-back vibe.

Stayed at a lot of hotels on the Strip this is definitely one of my 5 favorites so far. I valeted upon arrival, checked in with a really nice guy who had personality & was not stuffy at all, & found my hotel room with ease as it was an easy walk away from check in. I like that they have someone checking the hotel keys so only guests can enter the hotel buildings. 

Walking through the hallways is nothing special but once you open the door to your room the vibe changes. Arriving to darkness I pressed one of the high tech light switches & the curtains slid open & the lights popped on with style. The decor was not bombarding which I liked, very neutral & elegant with a mix cream & black hues. My resort room had a spacious king sized bed with living room & television that you can turn around to face the bed or the living room. The bathroom was very spacious with a huge bath tub & shower. Bath tub size is important to me when traveling... I like to soak & unwind. I like that the toilet is on the other side, away from the tub. They also have wonderful vegan, cruelty free body products instead of the cheap stuff so you won't be harming your body when you wash up which is often a concern for me as a person with sensitive skin who often has to carry my own beauty products with vacationing. 

We got the mountain view although we had the option of strip view. We chose this option because we were told that the strip side can get loud at night because of Surrender nightclub also at the hotel. It was still beautiful to wake up too. I loved how Encore\/Wynn had everything you need there so if you're not looking to wander all over the Strip & just want to relax you really have it all. There are beach clubs, night clubs, amazing restaurants (I ate at Jardin during my stay which was excellent), casino if you're into that, world class shows (saw Le Reve during my stay which was amazing & Showstoppers which I saw at another time... one of the best shows I have ever seen on the Strip period although sadly discontinued!), luxury shopping, & beautiful pools which unfortunately during my stay I didn't have the chance to check out. They even have a smaller version of the Bellagio fountains outside which I like better because they play fun classics like Frank Sinatra. You can also walk to the Palazzo easily as they have an escalator connecting to the hotel. 

My only complaint really was that the valet sucked. When we were leaving we had to walk outside, take an escalator down to the valet pick up, then wait underground for valet. Highly inconvenient when you're pulling luggage, not luxurious at all, & totally takes away from the point of valet which is that you're paying for the convenience of not having to do all of that. Other then that I really enjoyed my stay but would recommend self parking if you're going to have to go through all of that anyway. It's a beautiful hotel with better service then most places on the Strip & perfect for those who just want to stay in one area rather then galavanting all over town.",2,0,0

Unlike many, my check-in experience was flawless and my reservation was in order. I was there for 4 nights so plenty of time to take it all in. 

I thought the room was OK, small compared to rooms at Wynn and they seems like they were missing a few things -a DVD player for one. Bed was very comfortable and the room was well appointed but it was just OK. 

The casino while smaller than Wynn was nice but only 4 craps tables? It was funny to see a guy playing the $500 table by himself at 0700 - go figure -coffee please! The $10 table looked like the New Frontier was still up across the street. 

I thought the decor was fine, there were other colors besides red there , really, and well, it all looks good, now the butterflies that's another story, LOL. 

Plenty of place to imbibe, Eastside was nice, should be fun when it heats up and the pool is open. XS, that says it all. Good but limited restaurant choices -Botero (more later), -Sinatra (ditto), but they rock. 

The other cool part is that Encore & Wynn are connected together so you can gamble and drink and have fun all over the ""Resort"" and not have to go anywhere, like the place across the street that starts with a V.

She was taken from this hotel. I believe this is a contract\/side business\/scam these hotels and hospitals pull to generate revenue. To bring in as many people to the hospital as they can to charge everyone $5,000 for a 2-3 hour visit. I told them to take her to Kaiser but they didn't listen.

I must say, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Granted, I've never stayed at a 5-star hotel before, but I feel you cannot ask for more. 

Gambling: The roulette table was so much fun. My friend Jose spilled his drink on the table and nobody even yelled at him or made him feel bad. They just cleaned it up and joked about it. So cool. Also, as a first time customer, they gave me and my friend Carlo $20 to play the slot machines. We ended up winning over $100 collectively from that.

Pool: European. Nuff said.

Room: OMG. So nice. My phone had my name on the LCD. The room had a doorbell. Next to my bed was a control panel that could close or open the curtains! Swivel flat screen TV. Floor to ceiling windows. Tub and shower. Dual sinks. Amazing concierge service.

Nightclub: XS and Surrender are both at Encore. Surrender was awesome, but XS, I cannot explain how nice this nightclub is. You have to go to find out. It was expensive ($50 cover and $500 bottles), but hey, it's Vegas. It's expected.

Although my room was very nice, amenities were lacking and my two-star review is based on the fact this place seemed very overpriced for what you get. 

I stayed in a $500 \/ night Encore Tower Suite on the 51st floor that featured a beautiful view of the ""cheap side"" of the strip (Wynn is situated at the top of the strip so the cheap side overlooks the Stratosphere while the opposite side of the hallway had views of everything else and rooms were pricier). Encore Tower Suites is supposedly the VIP area of the hotel.

As far as I can tell, the only difference between this and the other, non-VIP side of the hotel is a huge increase in the nightly rate and smaller check-in lobby.  So basically it is for suckers like me. Encore Tower Suites is not in the same ballpark of hotel as the more established brands like The Four Seasons, and in a cheap city like Vegas I'd be shocked if better options did not exist. 

This hotel aggrivated me from the start with a la carte pricing for nearly everything I wanted to do. 

Wi-fi was $14 a night for EACH laptop. (unforgivable!)

Placing a non-hotel beverage in the in-room minibar fridge cost $25. (really? oh yes, and they have sensors to monitor things in the fridge) 

Overall, food seemed very shitty and very overpriced, although I suppose this is to be expected. Definitely style over substance. I didn't eat dinner at the hotel, but I had a crappy Reuben at the cafe ($30 total including a beer) and a $45 lunch (for one, no drinks) at the Asian restaurant Red 8 (which is in the adjoining Wynn), where my Dim Sum was a disappointment and the noodles were heavy with grease. I did not have a chance to dine at the finer restaurants; most of which seemed to have a nightclubby vibe, which is the predominant look in Vegas. 

To me, the crowd I saw in the elevators and lobby here seemed very Jersey Shore and seemed downscale, although I admit my east-coast sensibilities might be misreading things. Either way, this was not the casually elegant type of place I was hoping for. Women wore sequins and lots of makeup, dressed for prom in their gowns. Men with unusual facial hair designs wore fedoras and pointy toe snakeskin shoes. ""Trying way too hard"" was the overall dress-code. 

The room itself was beautiful, but the 'brassy and bold' design (black lacquer everywhere, one bedroom and living room wall was entirely a mirror, and gold fixtures everywhere) was not my personal taste. But the room itself was very nice, with big views and a comfy bed. They used nice materials and the bathroom was a highlight. 

The rest of the hotel \/ resort was absolutely overflowing with cheese. The spa \/ fitness center felt like a bad mashup of Disney and Egypt, and those red chandeliers in the casino were just hideous, although again, I suppose this is to be expected in a casino. 

In the end the whole experience did not feel VIP at all because you basically walk around the hotel being told ""sir, you are not allowed in there"". Like when I was done working out at the fitness center and the guy said ""oh, the showers are only for spa guests and it costs $40,"" and guy kind of barricades the doorway to make sure you don't enter the shower area. Um, ok, no big deal, just walk through the casino in my sweaty gym clothes, but repeated instances like this did not lend a high-end feel to the experience.

I should mention that the staff here is amazing and incredibly friendly including room service, maids, bellhops, and people at the check in desk. The hotel has really done themselves a service by hiring such quality people. My room had turn-down service.  

I looked inside the regular Encore rooms on the 51st floor and they looked identical with the bedroom \/ living room layout. I have no idea why people would book an Encore Tower Suite vs. an identical room on the other side of the hotel, because aside from check-in, there is zero discernable upgrade. No perks. 

I've never had a bad experience in this price range hotel until now, and have stayed in many better places for much less. I realize in Vegas people don't give a shit about the specifics of the hotel. But believe me, this place is a huge rip off.

If you get a deal (I got $137 per night midweek summer) it is a lot of bang for your buck.  There is a $25 resort fee but I believe I only paid this once if I read the bill right (I was there two nights).  For the room, itself, I would place it in a rank not quite as high as the Venetian and a little higher than the Bellagio.  I enjoy the buffet at this hotel quite a lot, so that is convenient.  The room has a lot of niceties like the by-the-bed control panel, lots of drawers, a desk that two people can use, a nice deep tub, a separate large shower with a place to sit\/elevate a foot,  a large sofa with a chaise lounge, and very nice bedding.  The pillows are large but I liked them.  There were nice huge ones to lean against while watching TV.  You could push a button by the door that would activate a request for service light if you stagger out after noon when they do their first round of cleaning.  There was also a scale in the bathroom (don't use this after the buffet) and a setting for night lighting in the bathroom so you don't have to blast yourself with fluorescent lights or stumble through the dark for late night bathroom use.  On the negative, I was irritated that I had to leave my room for coffee ... that was decidedly crappy for such a nice hotel ... we thought next time we'd have to bring our own instant coffee with hot tap water for caffeine emergencies.  There is also no refer (it said you could get one from housekeeping ... not sure if they charge ... we used the ice bucket).  The snacks are ludicrously priced even for a nice hotel ... seriously ... $8 for a little container of gummy fish?  Don't touch anything in the refer or it auto-charges you $25.

Some larger than others, but still all suites. So far, I have only stayed in the Resort Suite King. The bed is extremely comfortable. The large TV rotates to face either the bed or sitting area. The sitting area with the couch and desk looks over either the strip or the mountains, which you are able to choose upon checking in. They warn you that if you want the strip view you may hear some bass from the nightclub, but we did not hear anything. Maybe we just got back to the room too late. The bathroom is very elegant and large. There are 2 sinks, a shower and bath tub, and the toilet is in a separate enclosure. There is even a TV in there! Everything in the room was clean. 

Check-in time is stated as 3pm, but we arrived at 1:30 and were able to check in at no extra charge. The girl who checked us in was very nice and professional. They will offer you discounted room upgrades if available, and they offer suggestions for things to do within the resort. You can tell that they truly want you to have the best experience possible. 

Encore is pretty far at the end of the strip, but don't be put off by this if you like to get around all over the strip. A cab ride to the other side of the strip will only cost you about $20, or the walk to the center of the strip will be about 25 minutes. The Fashion Show Mall is a closer walk and features a ton of dining options, as well as a food court if you want to save some money. 

If you are looking to spend your stay mostly at Encore there is actually a lot to do within this resort and the Wynn, which is connected to it. For clubs you have XS (one of my favorites), Surrender, Tryst, and Encore Beach Club. Cirque du Soleil Le Reve, The Dream, is located in this resort. There are also dining and buffet options, and gambling\/slots of course. The pools are always clean and maintained.

This is the only place I stay now in Vegas after more than 20 years of visiting and staying in various Hotels on the Strip.  You get what you pay for, and this is the best luxury hotel in Vegas for the money - no competition.

The rooms are very large, all appointed with luxury sheets and linens.  The bathrooms all have dual vanities, soaking tubs, separate showers and toilets, and high end bath products.  They are always clean and very quiet - which for me is key.

The restaurants are pricey, but I would put them up against any other Hotel on the Strip for overall food quality, service, choice of cuisine and ambience.  I used to jump into cabs or walk all over the Strip to eat, but I find myself starting to spend more and more time in the Encore and Wynn to enjoy my meals.

The shopping... well, the stores are all pretty much high-end.  Let's just say I don't spend a lot of time there.

For nightlife, The Eastside Lounge is a great place to chill, drink and enjoy live music.  Tryst, Surrender and XS are all right there as well.

The Casino is always clean and the crowd is generally free of the riff-raff you find as you go farther South on the Strip.

There is a Euro Pool available aside from the regular pool that allows you to enjoy adult only pool time - which is amazing!

The panoramic view from the room was stunning. I haven't seen a hotel more beautifully designed and decorated in Las Vegas. Nothing is cheesy and everything is tasteful. 

The service was also exceptional. Every request, whether phoned-in, or, made in-person, was followed-up with a phone call to make sure everything was satisfactory. Expect to have any minor mishaps more than adequately taken care of. And expect to feel secure with security screenings at elevators. 

I also enjoyed lunch at Jardin, with its delicious food and bright floral decor. It's surrounded by high end retailers, in case you need to grab a quick item from Chanel or Hermes. 

The casino is also well-designed and perfectly laid out, with convenience in mind. The cashier is just a few steps away.",1,0,0

In fact it has been my favorite hotel in not only Vegas, but anywhere. The last visit, however, has made me rethink that. While the hotel is still as beautiful as ever, has the same ""Wynn scent"" I love so much pumping through the air ducts, it does not have the same feeling of home to it. The guests, while there have always been some idiots staying here are no longer a very small minority. With the opening of Encore Beach Club (this being the first time I have stayed here while it was open for the season), the crowd has gone from fashionable and classy to douchy, trashy, and obnoxious. The first sight I see walking through the front doors is not fellow guests of the hotel or an employee saying hello, but a group of young, loud 20 somethings (could be younger) who wouldn't be out of place on a trashy reality show coming from the day club.  This was par the course for my stay here. 

Our room while still nice was not up to the high cleanliness standards I have come to expect either.  There was a wet spot my girlfriend stepped in by the desk. I hope that was from someone spilling water and not housekeeping cleaning up vomit or something worse. A light was out, and some furniture looked dusty as well.  That is not acceptable when paying $300 a night.

It seems to me that because of the economic downturn, the hotel is going after the club crowd rather than the gambling\/luxury crowd.  I suppose the profit margin on charging idiots $1,000 a bottle for Grey Goose is a lot higher than renting out rooms, and if they do get someone who spends the night too, then that is just icing on the cake. 

I had to think long and hard about what star rating to give Encore. I will always love her and have a place for her in my heart, but I fear that her glory days are behind not forward. Will I go back again, yes but only in off season. I want to love this place. Will this be my go to hotel in Vegas anymore, sadly no.  For the price to stay here, The Mandarin Oriental or Penthouses at Mirage seem to be better alternatives.",0,0,0

This trip, I came for a Power Gen conference.  I used the room safe as I always do. I last accessed the room safe at about 6 PM on 12\/6 and left $1,700 cash secured in the safe. I went out for the night and came back to my room at around 3 PM. Shortly after that I checked the safe, which was still locked, but now the money was gone, removed while I was out. 

I notified security and they came by to have me fill out a single form and I was given the police report phone number and told to file a report and work with police. Security did check the safe and commented 'Yes, it had been opened during that period I was out"". I assume that there is an electronic record of all access. 

Any one reading this review can draw their own conclusions as to who could have possibly entered the room and opened the safe.

More troubling than being burglarized, was the fact that this incident was treated like a nuisance. I immediately checked out 4 days early and checked into another strip hotel. My staff will not be allowed back on company business and expense under any circumstances.

LONG STORY: My wife and I have stayed at several hotels in Las Vegas including the Wynn, but wanted to try something else, so we made a reservation (thru Platinum Amex) at the Encore (Tower Suites section). We were arriving on a Thursday and asked prior to arrival for an early check-in (1:30p instead of 3p). We were told this cannot be guaranteed and we understood it was only a best effort. When we arrived to check-in with the couple we were traveling with, each of us was given the (Platinum Amex) room upgrade. Our friend's room was ready right away and we were kindly told by Britney our room would be ready asap but no later than 3pm. That was fine and we changed in our friends' room and all headed to the pool.

When 2:30p rolled around we checked on our room. Still not ready. When 3p came and the room was STILL wasn't ready (no priority with housekeeping?), I asked the front desk to please see if they had ANY upgraded room available, since ours wasn't ready as promised. We were told we could take our reserved room or wait another 45 minutes for the upgrade, or we could pay for the double upgrade, which I didn't think was fair. Remember, we pay extra for the Platinum Amex Card for these upgrade and late checkout amenities, so it's not a ""gift"".

I asked to speak with the manager and was connected to Niovy. She gave me exactly what I expected -- NOTHING!. No ""sorry your room is not ready as promised."" Instead, she said ""it's not guaranteed at 3p. if you want that, we can put you in your reserved room or wait 45 minutes for the upgrade."" I don't like the ""I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do for you"" attitude in fine hotels. I travel worldwide to Four Seasons resorts and NEVER have this issue. I asked to speak with Niovy's supervisor and you can imagine the attitude I received then. I told her to please have Aisha call me on this matter and ended the call.

Then I get a call back ten minutes later from Niovy that, surprise, my room is now ready. I guess the squeaky wheel sometimes gets the great grease.

NOTE: AISHA left me a great message exactly as you would expect from a fine hotel, apologizing for the delay and sending some champagne and strawberries to the room as a gesture. AISHA is the type of manager you want to have working at your hotel. She turned around a potentially sour experience.",2,0,0

I had the highest hopes considering the wynns reputation to stay in this casino and I quite honestly have never had such a terrible time in Vegas. It started right off the bat, we went to check in and the front desk did not have our promotion information, so we had to fight for the offer that Wynn sent us in the mail and we used when booking the room. The lady at the front desk was nice but insisted that the ""head cashier"" said that promotion wasn't being started until December...wait but we booked our room for November with that promotion how is this possible? So WE had to go to the promotions website and pull up the ""details"" to show them and verify that indeed we were in the correct dates to receive the promotion in order to get the perks we were offered in the first place. This all took about 40 minutes at check in which is the last thing you want to do after a day of traveling. 

Finally we get into our room and I got underneath the covers on the bed to relax before meeting friends on the other end of the strip, I was only in bed for about 15 minutes total. As I got Into the elevator to leave I noticed it hurt when I pressed the lobby button...my knuckle had a bug bite on it...weird I thought...by the time I reached the palozzo my right leg (I was laying on my right side in bed) was on fire!!! I went into the bathroom at palazzo and saw bites all along my leg, I nearly scratched my skin off..when we got back to the hotel I asked the front desk to be placed into another room because I had these bites from who knows what..didn't ask for an upgrade or anything just another room and security was called for an incident report you could tell no one believed me because after all I have nothing better to do in Vegas than to lie about bug bites to get the same exact room I had before, unbelievable. So they did give us another room, a woman called us saying they found nothing..sure they're never going to admit they found something if they did..back to me being a liar...a liar with bug bite and bruises from the scratching in bug bite circles on my legs...okay sure thanks. Whatever I'm still hoping to enjoy my stay. We go to check out and the system is down, so we head over to bell desk to check bags and stay for breakfast. The bell man was so rude we decided we would rather shlep our own bags around than to leave them with him. So we go to the cafe next to the registration area AND we're asked to leave before we can even place order because my bag was quote ""too big"" to be allowed in the dining area...a regular sized bag...while everyone else in the cafe had their bags with them. Holy smokes! We get it, encore you want us out and never to return! Got it loud and clear, we immediately left after that opting to get to the airport almost 4 hours before our flight than to stay in this hotel. 

I will say we had a lovely experience at their buffet for lunch and the lady named Donna at the front desk tried really hard to make us feel better when we did finally get to check out..however I still will not return as the good does not over power the bad",0,0,0

I like to consider reviews on Yelp to be a way for future visitors to prepare for their stay...SO FAIR WARNING:  You may have read several reviews talk about the nightclub noise that lasts until 4am....it is 100% true and happened every night we were there.

We were on the 51st floor (!) facing the strip and each night...right up to 4am....there was a thumping coming from the clubs (either XS or the Beach Club one...whichever is running that night).   I had ear plugs so it didn't bother me....but if I were on Business or in a lower floor, it would drive me absolutely crazy considering how much they charge for rooms.

Don't bother calling the desk....this is normal for the hotel.  I imagine that long ago they considered the balance between the money they get for the clubs v. the inconvenience to their guests and decided it was worth it to allow the noise to continue unabated.  The issue is that both clubs have an open air component that expose the noise to the outside (pool areas) and those both face the hotel.

Bottom line:  Get a room that faces AWAY from the strip and towards downtown\/Fremont St to avoid this.....or get ear plugs (good ones) or stay in the penthouse floors and drink heavily.

Putting the noise aside.....this is a beautiful place with beautiful people paying beautiful sums to be among beautiful things.  If you want an idea of the have v. have nots, visit Fremont Street at night....it will make you appreciate what you pay for in order to stay at the Encore.

Security is everywhere....and I mean thick with folks in purple coats with earpieces.  Good example: There are 2 Jeff Koons exhibits (tulips and popeye) that are beautiful works of art....and have a Security sentinel posted 24\/7 next to each.  That's all that person does....watch the display.  This is in addition to the security you see just about everywhere you go....and I mean everywhere....all the time.  We were guests so we felt very safe and welcomed the layer of safety that you don't get just wandering the strip.  An example of the attention was at the pool where we had brought our own plastic cup that looked very much like it was made of glass.  The 1st day we were there we were advised (politely) by no less than 6 different employees that there was no glass allowed in the pool area.  We let each know it was plastic and they let us be....but it became comical after a while.  Speaking of the pool....

TIPS:  The main pool area can get crowded....there's another ""European pool"" (over 21 only) right next to it that was completely empty our 1st day (literally, we were the only ones there) and had less than 10 people there each of the other days we went.

There's a café just as you get to the Wynn side of the resort from the Encore that serves as good and inexpensive a breakfast\/lunch as you will find on the property.  It's just across from the show\/will call area and about 100 feet from the big tulips display near the show entrances.  Not super duper cheap but you can get breakfast for 2 for less than $20 which, trust me, is a find.

UBER began servicing the area within the last year and picks up in the main valet area; it is very plentiful....EXCEPT between 10pm - 2am when the club traffic picks up.  

We had a package that got us into Le Reve for free.....a great Cirque show that shouldn't be missed if you need something to do.  The buffet was also comp'd and had some really terrific offerings.  

For the casual Vegas visitor it's my impression that there are 3 levels of experience you can have depending on your budget:
Low end = Fremont Street (it doesn't get much lower than there....don't even think of bringing your kids there).  
Middle = West or east ends of the strip....your Circus Circus\/Excaliber\/Luxor experiences.  You can absolutely find a deal for under $100\/night and so long as your room is just a place to crash, you're good to go.
High end = The Encore\/Wynn\/Bellagio\/Cosmo experience.  You will pay for it but the people are prettier, security is better and the place smells better (I kid you not).

To wrap it up: If you have the money and want to be among others that also have money and be in a place where money is no object....this is a really great hotel..... exactly what you'd expect from a high end 5 star Vegas resort hotel..... Steve Wynn has a great place here.

....just be careful of where your room is and be ready with ear plugs.",3,0,0

Yes, the rooms are amazing, the staff is extremely friendly and the location perfect, because it's away from the craziness of the Strip.  The negative?  You have to pay for EVERYTHING!  I'm surprised nobody has mentioned that in both the positive reviews or negative ones.  Internet access in your room is $13.99 a day and that's not just for the room, no, if you have two laptops with you, both will have to pay the fee.  Sorry Encore, but this is the 21st century, get with the program.  If Starbucks now offers free internet, why can't you?
The spa and the gym, which in most hotels are included  with the room, is $40.  I totally understand that all the services that come with it need to be paid separately, but to use the treadmill or to enjoy the sauna or steam room? A little excessive. 
Last but not least, I'm not very impressed with the pretty tacky decor. Feels like the designer couldn't figure out what to go with.  Sleek? Modern? Traditional? Seventies motel? Result, the hotel is a miss match of different styles, with giant butterflies everywhere that are kind of an eye sore.  Sorry Encore, but I think I'll stick to the stylish Red Rock Resort, which might be far from the Strip, but which gets it right every time I'm there.",2,1,1

This is my 5th stay at this hotel in the 5 years it has been open, and the fist time I walked out wanting more and somewhat unsatisfied. 

Attn: Steve Wynn - you have done a fantastic job in making this one of the most decorated and award winning hotels on the planet - don't let your 5 star rating slip away. 

1.  Replace the mattresses immediately!   Our ""dreambed"" wasn't so dreamy and left me with an ache in my back in the morning.  

2.  Go to your Wynn HomeStore and grab a few of those $250 sheets off the shelf and replace the bedding in the Encore rooms.  The crisp white linens aren't so crisp and white any more.  I hope they are washed after each stay.  Are they? 

3. Don't charge guests extra for a North ""strip"" view.   This is deceiving to your guests because it isn't a view of the strip as guests would expect ---- charge us more for a piece of crap view of the recession-halted and incomplete construction of the fountain blue, circus circus, some empty desert,  and who knows what else.   I feel like you should credit us for these crappy view rooms!  What a rip off.  In fact this may be a deal kill for next time.  


Those three huge negatives aired, I will price this hotel against the other 5-stars on the strip next time.  If it is still the highest price, I may indeed try another property just to see what I am missing. I might feel like I am cheating on the Encore but hey, Im paying for 5-star I EXPECT 5-star !!!!!",0,0,0

Walking into the hotel, I felt that this is what all Las Vegas hotels and casinos should look like.  It was over the top without being tacky, the decor was chic and trendy.

The rooms were fantastic.  I have seen that people have posted on here that the rooms aren't as big as some other hotels on the strip, but honestly, the rooms have plenty of space.  It's a hotel room, not a house!  The room was pretty much the size of my Washington, DC apartment.  You could practically park my bedroom in DC in the bathroom of our suite.  Speaking of the bathroom, it was beautiful and the shower is heavenly.

I think the service here is incredible.  Everyone on staff was friendly and attentive.  I called down to the front desk after I discovered that all of the bedding was down (which I am allergic to) and someone was up to my room within minutes to remove the pillows and bedspread and replace them with equally luxurious hypo-allergenic bedding.

Loved the salt water pool, even though it is smaller than the pool at the Wynn (which you also have access to as a guest at Encore, but guests at the Wynn do not have access to the Encore pool), there are less children at the Encore (definite plus) and the atmosphere great.  I suggest ordering a couple pina coladas while you are there, they are incredible.   

Every time I left our hotel, I was dying to come back.  All the other casinos we visited appeared tacky and cheap in comparison.  Absolutely fabulous, and definitely the only place I would stay in Vegas.",1,0,0

The Encore is a little different from the Wynn in that it seems a bit more sparsely laid out.  Also, according to one of the clerks at the front desk, the Encore is supposed to be more ""contemporary"" than the Wynn.   Here are some of my thoughts about this hotel and casino:

Pros:
- Much less hectic gambling area with lower limit tables being available pretty much all day - even at peak times on Friday and Saturday nights, believe it or not.  
- The resort king suites are slightly larger than the Wynn's standard rooms with a separate sitting area and couch.  
- Closer to the shopping area with high end boutiques such as Chanel, Hermes and Rolex.  

Cons:
- Not many casual dining options.  My husband and I found ourselves walking over to the Wynn side for quick meals during our stay.    
- Slightly more expensive rates (at least whenever I've checked).  
- A lot of drunk people stumbling into the casino from the beach club in the afternoon, which can be annoying when you're trying to gamble.  
- Less selection of room toiletries (no razors, toothbrushes or slippers, which I've found in all of the Wynn rooms, from the standard rooms all the way up to the Tower and Parlor suites)
- Decor is a little too much for my tastes and I didn't care for all of the red in the casino.  

While I really enjoyed my stay here, I would probably stay at the Wynn side next time, just because the Encore seems kind of far from everything.  

But I must say that I had a great time gambling at the Encore and would come back to the tables here because it isn't as crowded.  And overall, one of the things I've noticed about the Wynn\/Encore is how friendly the dealers and pit bosses are.  Most of the ones I've encountered have been very personable and always willing to help you out if you're a beginning player.  Also, if you're a Red Card member and playing at the tables, you'll always get rated, regardless of your bet amount.",1,0,0

For instance, the turndown derive is one of the best I've ever seen in any hotel. Upon check in I was warmly greeted and they gave me many options of the type of room and had accommodations for any need I had. The hotel has its own desperate pools (one is European if you are feeling ""free"") and the best part is that non-guests can't buy their way into the hotel. This prevents weirdos (mostly) from coming in and it's a calmer pool but still has a Vegas vibe. Just not that gross Hard Rock Hotel vibe.  

They were always able to accommodate all reservations at any dining establishment and as always the conserve was above and beyond. I never once ran into a staff member that was less than fabulous and our room was the perfect size for a weekend getaway.

First of all: I get the idea of a red theme, but come on. When you can't look anywhere and not see a solid red something, you may have taken it a little too far. But that's a minor consideration...

The rooms are phenomenal. The curtain control is a nice touch. Bathrooms are truly decadent, with a TV in the mirror and a shower you could live in. Beds are comfy enough to collapse into after a long day (or night) and not want to get out of. Towels were fluffy enough by Vegas standards. The TV has more than the usual selection of channels. Service is excellent, from bellhop to desk to housekeeping. Valet is adequate.

Even though Encore was bustling with people when we were there, the casino was still oddly quiet. Not too surprising, since their table minimums were way high even compared to other Strip casinos. The Wynn properties have some of the tightest slots and shortest pays on video poker I've seen, and their slot club has a catch: you don't even get a permanent card until you accumulate 500 points. I have no idea how they'd rate you at a table if you were betting quarters at blackjack for eight hours with a no-name card.

Prices on drinks in the lounge are about 20% higher than other Strip properties, but the waitresses make up for it. (I'm just sayin'.) Everything is heavily marked up, unsurprisingly. drink service at machines is good if you tip reasonably, much better if you tip well.

The mildly unnerving thing about both the Wynn and Encore was the people who wiped down the machines after a customer leaves. Someone would discreetly move in, wipe any fingerprints off the shiny parts of a machine, and give the button area a quick wipe. Kind of an odd fetish, but it added to an overall feeling of sterility.

Maybe that was the biggest impression I got: Encore is like a supermodel in a magazine. Beautiful to look at, but distant and untouchable.",0,1,0

I don't know if this is how this joint is run, or if every incompetency the staff could muster just happened to fall on our heads that weekend, but I left never wanting to stay anywhere near a Wynn hotel again.  First, the place was severely understaffed, and the people who did work there clearly didn't give a sh*t, which only made everything that happened afterward worse.  

When we got to our suite, the lock on the door to the adjoining room was destroyed and there were champagne splatters all over our ceiling.  When we called someone to come inspect the room they said they would be up in 15 minutes; 2 hours later we called again and the girl at the front desk said the person who took our previous call never even sent anyone up.  45 minutes later when someone did come up to inspect it, they said they would take care of it later.  The maintenance staff for the door was nice, but when housekeeping came in to clean up she stole\/threw one of my articles of clothing that I left sitting on the bathroom sink away!  Who does that??  When I called to complain the front desk said they would ask our housekeeper what happened, then never followed up.

The room when clean was nice enough, but at night we could hear the people above us partying through the vents all night long.

When we finally left the hotel, the valet took 40 minutes just to find our car; people who came after us were sent away in less than 5.  Even after we left our friends had to wait another 20 minutes before the valet found their car.  The valet's excuse?  They ""lost"" our cars.  Even worse, when we pulled over at a gas station down the road my boyfriend noticed that the valet had somehow punctured a hole in the leather upholstery on the door of his Mercedes.  I don't know if Steve Wynn's blind ass poked his thumb through the upholstery like it was a Picasso, but that's just ridiculous.

We arrived at the hotel about 6pm, there was a bit of line, but we were quickly checked in and immediately received both our Red card (players card) all at the same time which I thought was quite convenient! We stayed on the 22nd floor and had the North view of the strip that faced Circus Circus. 

The room itself was quite spectacular! As soon as you walk in through the foyer there is a long hallway that leads directly into the bedroom, the bedroom and living room is separated by a half wall with a hole through it with a swiveling flat screen TV! What an awesome idea! You can watch TV in the bedroom or the living room!  The living room also had a nice ""L"" shaped couch with a large white ottoman. There is a desk with 2 chairs and a in-room fax machine... who uses those anymore?? 

The electronics of the room is nothing I have ever experienced before. There is two control panels you can use to control the lights, the one by the door in the foyer, or the control panel next to the bed on the night stand. Different buttons do different functions, my favorite by far was probably the curtain controls next to the bed, you can electronically have the sheers or drapes open and close by a touch of the button! Nice!! 

The bed was soooo  comfortable!! I now know what sleeping on a cloud feels like! It was plush, soft, and oh so heavenly! It puts my Tempurpedic to shame! I did some investigating and found out that it's an exclusive bed made by Sealy for the Wynn hotels, for a little under $3,000 I could have one delivered right to my house! It even has the ""Wynn"" embroidered all over the mattress... I always looked forward to coming back to the hotel after 6-8 hours of non stop strip walking! OH! and I can't forget about the 100% Wynn egyptian cotton sheets and the gigantic Wynn sham! I miss the bed the most!

The bathroom was set up very nicely as well. There is a beautiful walk-in tile shower, with a separate hand held sprayer & shower head, which is unusual for a hotel, but I loved it! There is a large soaking tub that was right next to the walk-in shower. There are dual sinks and a separate room for the toilet. The best part of all was the TV in the bathroom! That is a nice touch! 

By far, one of the most magnificent hotel I have ever stayed in, and happy that we stayed 4 nights here!

We were able to get a great deal through Southwest vacations already, and when we arrived, our room was immediately upgraded to the panoramic suite facing the Strip without our even requesting!

Rooms were spacious, had a nice view, and the beds were crazy comfortable. The bathroom was so clean that I even ran a bath. The view of the Wynn and the Strip was super baller. However, if you're actually planning to get some sleep (Um, you're in Vegas. Why sleep?), be aware that the rooms facing the strip are also facing Encore Beach Club\/Surrender night club. On the 58th floor I could still hear music all day\/night long (I suppose they shut it down at some point in the very early morning until about 11am). I didn't care, but I think if I was actually trying to get a full night's rest, I might care. The hotel staff were professional, courteous, helpful, accommodating. We requested a few things from housekeeping and they brought them quickly.

In the casino, I was able to catch $10 minimums for craps tables a lot of the time, even during some peak hours. It doesn't beat downtown Vegas $5 minimums, but at least you don't have to schlep all the way there. Video poker machines are slow but entertaining, so you can just put in a little bit of money, play slowly, and get some free drinks. 

The pool was fantastic and our group spent quite a bit of time there. One of the nights, we went to Surrender night club. The line looks intimidating and doesn't make a lot of sense (it stretches through the middle of the casino), but it went pretty quickly. The club itself was very nice and had a mini casino.

It's a good thing we got a deal on our stay here because everything is expensive. Internet is $13.95 for 24 hrs (lucky we got it for free). Breakfast burritos are $10. I made a big stink about this, but damn if it wasn't a tasty breakfast burrito. The $10 is probably paying for their super wasteful packaging: thick plastic container inside a plastic bag.

The location of the hotel is at the end of the Strip, but we didn't feel like we were missing out on anything. A few times, we walked to other casinos (as far as the Bellagio, but took a taxi if it was farther). We still felt like we had options of where we wanted to spend our time and didn't feel limited by the location.

My 2-stars deduction came from A) the location on the strip.... all the way at the end, and B) the $32 per day ""resort fee"" you are hit with when you check out.  How is it ""complimentary fitness center access and internet access"" when you end up PAYING a daily resort fee?  How many people use a fitness center in Vegas anyways?  Ive stayed at 10 places on the strip and this was the first hotel to do that.  Yeah, $32\/day wont break the bank but when you are CHECKING OUT in Vegas after coughing up money at the tables and buying $15 drinks the last thing you want is another $100 dent in your wallet.    Its clearly listed in the ""Terms and Conditions"" when you book online but who reads those things?  Here's a suggestion... just include the mandatory fee in your daily rate.

Note, you are staying at a nice hotel so mini-bar, drinks etc are all going to reflect that. 

I was concerned about being all the way at the end of the strip but it wasn't an issue. Cab line was never crazy and let's be honest, I cab all over Vegas no matter where I stay!

Pool - amazing and never felt too crowded. Great poolside gambling

It was the first impression of walking through the doors that truly affected me the most. The Encore Las Vegas is a 5 star hotel by Steve Wynn and appeared to go above and beyond in terms of customer satisfaction and amenities. When I first arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by immense, solid mahogany doors, which in a sense, seemed like a symbol of greatness. As I stepped through the door, I was greeted by large floor to ceiling windows that gave out a subtle dosage of sunlight, which helped emphasize and bring about the warm red and gold ambiance throughout the room. It literally felt as though I entered a new majestic world because I've never experienced anything as amazing as this, in terms of architecture. As I continued to walk forward, I noticed the plush and soft red carpet that essentially massaged my every step. When I looked left and right, I couldn't help but notice the great amounts of detail of the walls and ceilings from the elegant art work and chandeliers that complimented the soft yet vibrant colors, all the way to the extensive use of decorative crown molding and trim. It was a room that made me feel extremely comfortable since it was exceptionally spacious and quiet for a casino hotel, all complimented by a beautiful fragrance that virtually eliminated all hints of cigarette smoke. I don't know why, but entering the hotel was amazing.

The overall property of the Encore feels very comfortable and intimate. It didn't feel like I was being suffocated by a low ceiling and slot machines at every corner. I remember once going to the Treasure Island and I just felt that I was rubbing elbows with every person in the casino and lobby. However, my experience at the Encore was more pleasant since the overall property felt roomy. Another thing I truly appreciated about the Encore was the service. Everyone at the concierge desk or check in desk greeted me with a smile and appeared to be very patient when I asked questions about shows and dining. A great touch to the trip was when the kind woman at the check in desk comped our roll-in bed during our 5 night stay. The one thing that really stood out at the Encore was the guests. The guest seemed to dress fairly nice and their appearance seemed a little high class. What I mean is that you rarely saw someone walking around the hotel with a tank top or raggedy attire. 

In terms of dining and shopping, it seemed like the Encore had the best of the best. The shopping esplanade was very high class- a little out of my price range! I didn't eat at any of the restaurants but I feel that they are probably good anyway. I honestly found myself walking over to the Wynn Buffet and eating most of my meals there.

My only complaint about the Encore is the location. Although it's quite secluded from the heart of the strip which is where all the action is, it's still a far hike to get to the popular hotels and attractions located near like the Bellagio or MGM Grand. But other than that, I absolutely had no complaints.

Overall, I had a great time at the Encore and I will definitely make sure to book my stays there whenever I return to Las Vegas in the near future.",0,0,0

The Encore is just too perfect. It's only negative? It's so far north on the strip. Now, if you're looking for a tad more seclusion and a break from the hectic Strip, Encore is right up your alley. From start to finish, our stay here (about a year ago) was spot on. Granted this was a year ago, but we still visit Encore every trip to Vegas for gambling and to visit their absolutely phenomenal spa (read my review here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-spa-and-salon-at-encore-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:Uh0PBBFqF7BYZIZCYvw-_w )

They offer a spacious, semi-suite room as their most basic option. Yes, please! Luxurious bathroom and extras throughout the room. Very quiet. Amazing bed. I get sleepy just thinking about the extra soft linens!

Amazing restaurants throughout. Botero is our family favorite (I'm reviewing that next and will also post pictures). Switch can be easily missed as it is kind of in the ""back"" but this is a one-of-a-kind gem of a steakhouse. The ceiling decor literally switches its designs. The food isn't too shabby, either ;) (AKA, damn delish).

This is a gorgeous hotel, and hands down, right now my favorite.  The rooms here are slightly bigger than those at the Wynn, and are suites with a small living room, a desk, large LCD TVs that swivel to both the living room and bedroom where there are some of the comfiest beds you'll ever sleep in, large bathrooms with all the amenities, etc, etc.  

During our stay, our thermostat was set to low (100 degree Vegas weather of course) but for some reason, our room stayed fairly warm.  It was downright hot in the bathroom, so I called maintenance and while they were quick to respond, the room still couldn't get to the temperature we prefer.  Boo number one.

Encore is home to some of Vegas' hottest clubs.  It's got XS and Tryst and now Surrender, but what it doesn't have are late night dining options.  On Thursday, we got to the Cafe Society just after it closed at a little past 11pm. Yes, 11pm.  On Friday, we got there just after it closed again, at 3am.  For a hotel that houses a number of clubs, late night dining options should be a must.  This provided to be a big frustration for us this trip.  Boo number two.

A few boos aside, this place is still my top choice for Vegas.  They have several, gorgeous pools, tons of table games and slots, a fantastic spa, and some of the most friendly staff around.  I think every employee I interacted with was extremely friendly and helpful. It's located directly across the street from Fashion Show Mall and if you happen to get bored here, you can hop over to Palazzo, next door.",13,13,13

I have coordinated logistics and hotel reservations all over the world and never had the problems I experienced with these people. I was charged  $2,900 for a ONE night stay in a 2 bedroom suite. I prepaid for the room and asked that my client be allowed to just pick up keys. Instead they not only asked for an additional card for incidentals they told him they never rent out the 2 bedroom to people like him. This coming from a man named Trent. Excuse me? People like whom? After complaining to the manager, they made an exception about the additional card but after check out their cashier tried to fraudulently run an additional $550 on my card!!! Thank God American express notified me immediately. I call the hotel and the rep has the nerve to tell me we were checking to see what you had available on the card? I went ballistic and told them why are you illegally charging my card after checking out. Then it was ""oh it was an accident.""

I get another call from Chad the manager saying he called American express to reverse the charges. 
This is the shadiest hotel I have ever dealt with. My client asked to extend his stay but asked to be relocated to the Cosmopolitan. He refuses to stay there ever again.

I wish I could stay at the Encore each time I came to Vegas. If you want to be treated like a King\/Queen, they definitely do their best to make you feel like royalty. 

Aside from minor personal complaints, I must say this is a classy place. As I arrived for my 9 day stay during EDC week last June, the bell boy was making a few remarks that I wasn't too thrilled about. He mentioned, ""I can tell you guys won't be eating at any of our restaurants"". After explaining that we were staying 9 days and the fact that we did NOT bring any food with us, he said okay. Yes I had a big cooler to hold all my alcohol and to my surprise, they almost did not allow me to have so much due to the fact that they didn't want us to be all crazy in the hotel. Come on! I didn't pay so much for my bf and I to be hassled left and right. 9 days is a lot, it wasn't like I wasn't going to purchase anything there. 

Check in can be hit or miss with the lines. Just be patient, the place is worth it! The casino is quite lively at any time of day and everyone is extremely helpful when you need anything.

Our suite was lovely! Very comfortable, very clean, and was better than the pictures online! We had a crazy schedule where we were asleep during the day and up at night. I really wish the maid services paid a little more attention to the DO NOT DISTURB signs. Every now and then we had to yell through the door to go away. They do, however, send someone to clean your room at whatever time you ask so we were grateful for that at least.

I am aware of the class this place has, but I had issues each time I entered\/tried leaving to EDC. Security stopped me each day and told me to go back to my room to cover up or wait outside until I cover up. WHAT? I'm just trying to leave\/return to my room, not hang out and parade myself for the hotel guests! I thought this was incredibly rude especially since my outfits were not something out of the norm. I saw girls on the floor but I am the one being scolded? Please....

The food here is glorious! Beware, there is nothing cheap here or at the Wynn! Dinner for two at some places were $300+ no alcohol! To this day, we still think all our expensive meals were worth it. Room service is devine! I was sick one day and ordered soup to the room. Best soup ever! I can't forget how amazing it was.

Due to my personal complaints, I'm not sure I want to stay at an EDM friendly place and get picked on when I just want to leave\/enter my damn hotel. Also, if you are looking for great rates, buying a flight+hotel is the cheapest way to go. 

I wanted to give the Encore another 9 days of business this year, but for EDC, I think I'll go to friendlier EDM hotel. I'll make sure to come back here during a regular week instead no thanks to those security guys.",6,2,2

Having a suite provides a ""home base"" for the various members of my party to meet, have some cocktails, regroup, etc. On the past several trips that I have made to Vegas I have stayed at the Palazzo (which I love) and decided for this trip it was time for a change...why not check out the new hotel? 

I will start with the things that I enjoyed about the Encore. First of all it is easy to navigate and easy to get to the rooms. I enjoyed the adult pool area, despite our flakey server and rude guys next to us. 

Unfortunately, that is about it for the things that I liked. As far as the rooms themselves go the rooms at Palazzo are far better for the purposes of a group like mine. First of all, the sofas at Palazzo pull out into beds so you have that extra space if you need it. (They are also larger and provide more seating). The swivel TV I thought was incredibly lame, Steve Wynn can't spring for 2 TVs in every room? I'm not sure where it would have gone though, since it felt that these rooms were smaller than the rooms at Palazzo. (I have a feeling they were wider and not as long...) There was essentially no counter space to put anything (jewelry, a bottle of vodka...) In addition, it is pretty far down the strip, a good walk to most places. 

While we were there the hotel experienced a loss of hot water. FOR AN ENTIRE DAY. They actually were suggesting to people that they walk over to the Wynn and shower at the Spa there. Really? That is all you can suggest? We must have been the first wave of irate guests, when we went to the front desk to find out what was up they were simply apologizing and not offering any sort of compensation. After a short time they offered us a $50 credit, and then extended that to all of the hotel guests. Personally, I do not think a $50 was adequate compensation for a hotel that supposed to be the new luxury destination in Vegas. 

I do not think that the Encore will be on my list of hotels to stay at again. In fact, my experience there leads me to question what staying at the Wynn would be like. I have a feeling that I will just continue to stick with the Palazzo.",7,0,6

The hotel lobby is majestic, the casino clean, and the visitors classy. The place is an amalgam of posh luxury and keen modernism, both which balance out nicely.

We had a room on the 58th floor with a panoramic view of Wynn, the golf course, and the strip. Loved the floor-to-ceiling windows. The room itself has a nice decor to it - with a hint of minimalism. And of course, the bathroom was huge.

Unfortunately, a few things hold the hotel back from reaching its 5-star potential:

- Nightclub noise: My biggest gripe. We stayed here from Sunday to Tuesday - the first two days, the booming bass from the nightclub music revebrated so loudly - till 2AM, no less. And to think that this was while I was on the 58th floor... I just felt terrible for the lower floors. If you're a sensitive sleeper, be wary.

- Resort fee: So they charge a $15 resort fee a night... yet Wifi & fitness center fees are additional charge. What?

- Personal refrigerator: They stocked up the mini fridge with their own drinks and charge you if you remove them. Oh, but they'll rent you a personal one... for $25 a night.

All these marketing schemes are minor annoyances and shouldn't be happening at a hotel of this caliber.

Complaints about the room is the shower heads need to be replaced they are very old as well the technology in the room needs to be updated. For the price of this room it should be top of the line no excuses. Get rid of the control center that opens the drapes and turns the lights on and off.  It works when it wants to and it's yellowed from the age and sun. Get a new control 4 touch screen remote like Cosmopolitan and Aria have for all rooms.

I am in love with this hotel. In love! It's far enough off the strip to not be overly crowded and it's beautiful from top to bottom. 

Rooms:

""Did we accidentally book a suite?"" we thought as we walked into our spacious room with floor to ceiling windows that overlook the city. Nope. Apparently every room is just this beautiful! The room is huge and I can only imagine what a suite looks like! We stepped through our door and saw a long hallway that opened up into a bedroom with a King bed and two night stands, and an entertainment center with a tv that swings around 360 degrees! Past the bedroom, we then saw a sitting area with a L-shaped couch, desk and floor to ceiling windows. The room is bright, cheerful, clean and decorated nicely. It's just a shame it's in Vegas, a city where you spend very little time in your room! The beds are so comfortable. They are a product of Wynn and can be purchased through Wynn. The robes are silky smooth. Everything is state of the art. My only qualm? The music doc isn't iPhone 5 compatible. Boo! But to make up for it, they do have several music stations available on the tv. 

Amenities\/Casino: 

Treated like royalty is the theme here. The rooms are amazing, every restaurant\/cafe\/eatery is state of the art and delicious, the casino is very clean without the strong stench of a casino and it's just a cheerful environment. It's not your typical ""Vegas."" I also really like that they keep the Encore Beach Club separate from the resort, so that you don't even know it's going on unless you're going to the party. The pool is gorgeous and I just wish I had time to lounge. In fact, I would have liked an extra day just to utilize the pool. They have several restaurants on the property with outdoor patios overlooking the water and pools. My favorite amenity of the Encore? They have dueling pianos every night of the week! It took us going to two different casinos and two failed attempts to find a piano bar, only to realize when we got back that our very own hotel has them!

Service: 

I was very impressed with the service the entire trip. Check in was seamless and the girl gave me suggestions about places to visit during our trip. The staff working every restaurant and bar was very friendly and helpful and it was just an overall great experience. 

On a side note, this is attached to the Wynn which is like Encore's wealthy older sister, but the great thing is that you never really realize which hotel you're in. It's just a small walk through the hotel and through the shopping and then you're in the Wynn and can enjoy all the amazing things they have to offer as well (make sure you go to Sugar and Ice and the Lakeside).

First of all, the decor and layout of both of these hotels is inviting and very open. If I ever went back to Vegas this would likely be the only hotel I consider for one specific reason - while many other hotels along the strip are beautiful and well decorated, this one is the only that does not seem overly packed with tourists who are taking pictures and\/or finding their way around. Of coarse, I'm a tourist too, but this hotel feels like vacation.

The pools at both Encore and Wynn are beautiful. The service in the cafes and restaurants is great. We splurged a little bit and had a nice dinner at the Country Club. If you're thinking of it - do it! It's not only romantic, the food and wine are amazing.

Lastly - the actual rooms in the hotel (I can only speak for Encore) are exactly what they look like in the pictures. The suites are huge, clean, and beautiful. I've never stayed anywhere else in Vegas - but this is by far the best hotel I've stayed in. If you book in advance, it's also reasonably priced.",3,1,0

Valet was awesome. The guys there are fast, efficient and very courteous. Didn't have any problems at all! Check-in wasn't so good. I booked my room about 2 months in advance and upon check in, no rooms were available unless I upgraded. The check-in lady was tryin to hustle! I mean two months? C'mon the room should've been reserved. But after about 15 minutes, one miraculously opened up.  Hm... makes me wonder a little. Anyways moving on.

The hotel is beautiful with lots of red. A little too red for my taste.. The gaming area was very limited. Not many slots and tables. The elevators are freakin fast and there is rarely a wait which I love!! The room itself is spacious and stunning! Everything from the bed, to the couch, to the bath rugs are luxurious and extravagant. Plenty of closets and dressers for your clothes. Loved the room! But check out took foreverrrrrr... Literally it took us about 40 minutes!! 

Maybe I'm just a lazy girl or out of shape but the walk is far to places like the Bellagio or Caesars! Felt like my legs were gonna buckle any second from the walk lol. Every little detail in the hotel is beautiful like the doorknobs, the towels, and even the toiletries. We even saw Andrew Bynum checking in, go Lakers!!

PROS:
- Beautiful Casino.
- Surrender and XS look like they would be a great place to shake your tailfeather.
- I definitely liked their pools and cabanas.

CONS:
- I upgraded for an additional 50 per night.  Total rip...there was no special tower pool and the rooms were the exact same.
- Surrender's thumping base could be heard til the wee hours of the morning.
- Customer Service was not up to par and people didn't really seem to care if you were unhappy with the service they were giving you.  You think this would be the opposite since Vegas is hurting so much for business.

I will definitely be back to check out the Clubs but not as a guest.",12,5,5

They removed the charges for the dish however this is not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. On check out there was a charge of $25 for putting a soda in the fridge as it is weight censored and the front desk agent seemed unfazed when I thought this was a ridiculous charge.

I have stayed at the Palazzo, Four Seasons, and MGM suites in Las Vegas, and I have to say that the Encore is just as nice if not nicer than the rest of those establishments.

Service: Impeccable.  Everyone we ran into from housekeeping to valet were extra friendly and provided us with first class service.

Room:  Again, amazing!  Top-notch room with all the amenities that you could want.  Was very relaxing, it was almost a bummer that we had to leave the room it was so peaceful.  Beds, bathrooms are beyond luxurious!  

Food:  The restaurants in the Encore are just as great as those found in the Wynn itself, which are all pretty much first class.  None of them are cheap though, so if you are trying to find a cheaper bite don't stay around the hotel.

Casino:  The casino is one of the down-points about the hotel.  The casino floor is very small.  Not a lot of table games, and the entire feel seems to leave you expecting more.  The Wynn is less than a five minute walk away though, which is perfect for gaming.

Pool:  The pool is very much mature-adult themed.  Two wade pools, no lazy rivers, waterfalls, or anything of the sort.  One of the pools is a topless pool, but there was only one woman who braved the judging and went around topless.  Great place to relax and soak up some sun, but not the party-type hooking up place in Las Vegas.",3,2,2

This combo is bad, because when your leaving is so hard to do. you want to think of ways to stay longer.
The rooms were spacious and the glass windows are amazing to sleep and to wake up to. The tub and bath rooms are big and you stay in there for hours.
Soaking, shaving, watching TV while soaking in a 110f  tub, drinking a cold beer! That my think for the morning!

Wynn & Encore have a special place in my heart - I immediately fell in love with the design and the beautiful chocolate color of the buildings the first time I saw it. 

As soon as we walked into the hotel I jumped onto the beds and screamed for joy as i looked out onto the beautiful strip.  I've stayed in some pretty bad hotels (think Imperial Palace), somewhat bad hotels (think Harrah's), somewhat okay hotels (think Treasure Island) but this was the best hotel experience ever.

We also had a problem with a broken shower, and the promise of the maintenance guy to show up in the morning slipped through the cracks. After I called again and he did come, he basically blamed the guests for breaking the shower when the bellhop had never explained how to use that knob in the first place, so I am guessing the previous guest who broke it also did not get an explanation. To switch from the handheld shower to the overhead by turning off the shower and not pulling the knob is NOT intuitive. Also, the concierge told us we could request an airport shuttle when we had our bags held at the bell stand the last day, but the bell hop said too bad, we had to do that 24 hours ahead of time. That is a huge piece of miscommunication between what the concierge tells the guests and what the bellhops are willing to do.
There is a sort of arrogance that this is how the hotel works, as in a ""why don't you know this"" attitude, but as a first time guest, with no one communicating things like the turndown ""rules"" or the way the shower knob works, how are we supposed to know? Also, if a concierge tells me something, why is the bellhop telling me something different? There needs to be better communication - that is the weak link in this beautiful hotel's system. For instance, we got an offer in with our Le Rêve tickets for a free drink at Blush, but then they would not let us in unless we paid $30 for my husband, because according to the girl at Blush, free admission and the drink were ""only for the ladies."" If those are the ""rules,"" that's fine, but print it on the card so people will not be mislead when reading ""just bring your ticket to receive this offer"" It should be ""just bring your ticket if you are female, and be prepared to pay $30 and not get the free drink if you are male."" Btw, we did use the free drink and appetizer offer at Society Cafe, and the bartender basically rushed us in and out of there, whereas we saw him constantly topping off the champagne glasses of a bunch of girls at the bar with free refills. Hubby overheard that they were friends of the bartender. Not that I would have wanted a refill, as Freixenet is not actually champagne (I was surprised an upscale establishment like the Wynn\/Encore wouldn't be more careful with their wording - and Freixenet tastes vile to me), but it did take away from the special upscale feeling when we saw not every guest was being treated equally.
We tried a couple of times to see the free show by the waterfall, but could never find the free viewing platforms mentioned in guidebooks. And when we saw the show it was like, is that all? (A couple of glowing balls made a baby ball with some music.) Finally I found someone who told me there were several different shows, and the upstairs outdoor café area was the ""free viewing"" area, (slightly obscured by trees). So we saw it a second time and there was a flamenco-themed video projected on the rock wall. Not as entertaining as the people watching as hundreds lined up to get into the clubs. If you want to go, pack a skin tight dress with a skirt up to your crotch and 5-inch hooker heels, and you'll fit right in, lol.
To conclude, comments by the employees about what ""most guests"" do makes anyone with a question, problem, or request feel like their uniqueness is being brushed aside - at a ""5 star"" hotel, no guest wants to get the impression that the staff has no intention of changing how they do things that aren't working, so if they didn't tell you something you needed to know on your first trip, too bad for you, but they don't really care because they see too many people. I answered their post-stay survey because I thought they wanted to be the best and could use our comments to get from an A minus to an A plus in customer experience, but I feared I might have been wasting my time. And indeed, no one ever contacted me about my comments. I really don't expect them to change the way they do things, although improving the housekeeping communication would be a great step in the right direction.",1,1,0

Then, I was with a bunch of friends at encore beach, and they left me and one of my buddies with all of our stuff which isn't a big deal, but the security staff wouldn't let me into the very hotel that I'm staying at because I didn't have a t-shirt.

Be aware of touching anything on the wet bar they will charge you if it's removed longer than 30 seconds. What I especially loved about the Encore is it is the very end of the line on the north end of the strip. They don't allow non guests to bring in strollers so you're not going to get a bunch of kids running around. You're also not going to get a bunch of drunk idiots as the food and drinks are very expensive. It seemed to me the only people walking around are the guests staying there. The drinks are bare minimum $9 for beer and 15-17 for cocktails. This keeps people from over indulging I believe. The pool at Encore was beautifully kept. We preferred the over 21 European pool to the general one. It was  relaxing and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Restaurants all delicious but very expensive. If you have a loose wallet and want luxury this is your hotel. You will not feel comfortable waking around this hotel in tshirts and flip flops  if you're not swimming so bring nice clothes!

I contacted the hotel and filled out an incident report and they were very kind as today I spoke with the claims department they said they will not be covering the phone and purse that has been extremely damaged during this incident. I am disappointed that the encore does not take responsibility for the actions of their staff members for situations such as this I was a guest at their hotel and went to an event at one of their pool parties and I was treated very unfairly during this process.

We stayed in July, so it's super busy around that time in Vegas. We were in town to celebrate my mom's 50th birthday and were expecting to only have a great time the minute we landed. Check in process for Las Vegas hotels is hell on earth and that's to be expected especially checking in on a Friday. So we're given a key to our room, the minute we walk inside we are welcomed to a room that has clearly not been cleaned out by the previous guest. Wish I would've taken pictures of this. Food containers everywhere, an unmade bed, and sheets all over the floor. Ok...not exactly what anyone wants to deal with after a long flight into Vegas and and even longer wait in line to actually check in. My mom calls the front desk to let them know the situation and the front desk lady says the best she can do is take off our resort fee and give us the next available room that was just like the one we were supposed to check into. Yup, that's right they didn't even offer us an upgraded room. Woohoo, I mean we were a good amount per night there. Taking off the resort fee was actually quiet comical to us, but whatever. So she tells us we don't have to come all the way back down stairs to re-activate our key she could do it right from the computer. She assigned us our new room and we were on our way. Well, at least we thought we were. We get to the second room, and what a surprise our key doesn't even open the room. My mom had to ask one of the house keepers if she could go in the room they were cleaning to use the phone to call downstairs. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come upstairs to let us into our room. My mom calls downstairs to talk to the manager, and Im not sure if this lady took any real training on how to manage a 4-5 star hotel but this lady was beyond rude. She basically said that there's nothing else they can do besides take of a $35 a day resort fee (total $70 since we stayed for 2 nights). No comped dinner, no comped night, or anything extra at the hotel. Beautiful hotel but I definitely won't bother staying here again. Learn to treat your guest that are paying a lot of money a night with respect and at least try to find ways to make a bad situation that was the hotels fault better. Like seriously, it would've been super easy for them to offer us credit at one of the restaurants at the hotel we obviously would've ended up spending more money there so in the end that's more money they would've made.

They offered us a room upgrade for $30 per night and we took it.  Our room was large and had a decent view (although not amaaaazing) so I am overall glad we went for it.  I also liked the features for turning on\/off the lights.  It made the hotel room feel very modern.

I was given appropriate compensation for my poor experience and offered a complimentary upgrade should I visit Wynn\/Encore in the next year. I am changing my review from 1-star to 2-stars because of this, although it's a shame that it took a flaming review to get them to resolve the issue.

-------------

My stay at Wynn\/Encore was the worst hotel experience I've ever had out of any hotel claiming to be a ""luxury"" hotel. Encore may look luxurious from the inside, but their service and code of ethics would easily be outdone by a lower class hotel like Motel 6. In fact, my overall Vegas experience would have been better had I stayed at a Motel 6 instead of Wynn.

My misery began upon check-in on the evening of September 8, 2016. I had booked a Resort King Suite at Encore. During check-in, I could tell from the attendant's facial expression that something wasn't quite right. He typed away for a couple minutes, and then exclaimed, ""I've found a great room for you sir!"".

He said it's only a couple minutes walk from there, and on the Wynn side. I asked why I was being sent to Wynn when my reservation was for Encore. He told me they didn't have availability at Encore, and the Wynn room was equivalent to the room I had booked. I asked if it was the same size, and he said that it was 700 sq feet. I asked if I'd get a credit since he's putting me in a smaller room, and he told me that that's not possible, since the room I was getting was actually at a higher rate than the room I booked. This was all very strange...why am I not getting the room I had reserved and paid a deposit on? How is a smaller, older room, have a higher rate than a newer, bigger room? He told me that if I wanted, I could contact the front desk in the morning to see if any Encore Resort King Suites had become available.

Although I was suspicious, I was also tired, so I relented, took the keys, and went to my room.

Much to my surprise, the room was not at all similar to the room I had booked and paid for. It was a single room rather than a 2-room suite with a divider, and it was substantially smaller.

So let's review so far:

1. The hotel booked more rooms than they had available, intentionally to maximize their revenue, knowing full-well guests would show up and they wouldn't get the rooms they had reserved. ETHICALLY DEVOID and CORRUPT.

2. The attendant attempted to deceive me with this exclamation of ""We've found a great room for you!"". HE LIED.

3. He told me it was 700 sq feet, when it was 600 sq feet. HE LIED AGAIN.

4. He told me that the rate on the Wynn room was higher than the room I had originally booked, so there would be no credit. I checked online when I got up to my room. The room I was sent to was about $100\/night less than what I booked. HE LIED ONCE AGAIN.

5. He put the onus of correcting the issue on ME rather than the hotel, by telling me I could call the front desk the next morning. Any hotel with any semblance of ""luxury"" would be proactive and not only contact me the next morning, but offer amends. INADEQUATE SERVICE.

The exciting first night in Vegas turned into one of fraught with anxiety. Nothing irks me more than knowing I've been taken advantage of. And the con of Wynn\/Encore was just beginning.

The next morning, after a mostly sleepless night fretting over whether I was going to get the right room, I ate some breakfast, and headed to the front desk.

First, I spoke to another front-desk receptionist. I explained the situation, now for the second time, and she told me she'd put my name on the list of people to get an Encore Resort King Suite after the rooms were cleaned. I asked for a credit for having been downgraded the prior night, and she offered me a credit of one night's resort fee ($35) for my ""inconvenience"". 

Really? A whopping $35 for my inconvenience?

How about compensation for your incompetency? For your lies? For all the time I spent dealing with this nonsense instead of enjoying my trip?

I asked to speak to a manager. 

""Danny"" the manager came over, and fortunately he was already aware of my complaint. ""Danny"" seemed like a reasonable person, until he started talking:

""You weren't put in a lesser room...it was just a smaller room.""

He eventually agreed to credit me the resort fee for all 3 nights. Satisfied, I walked away. Upon check-out I looked at the bill.

No credit. 

When I returned home, I called the Billing Department and left a voicemail.

My call was never returned.

I hope somebody sets Wynn and Encore on fire.",11,4,3

I'm guessing we are not their target audience because it's clear they want us to gamble a bunch, which neither of us do not.

The rooms were beautiful.  The pictures others have posted were completely representative of what our room was like and we had a decent view which we really enjoyed day and night.

I really enjoyed the fact that this place is so nice they don't have those annoying vendors that ask you to go to a show, etc.  After about four days of that, I'm done.

This location is right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall, which is convenient if you need to pick up a couple of items.

There is also a Walgreens and a liquor store within walking distance of the Encore so you can come back to your room and pregame before a night on the town.  

I always bring a hotpot with me when I travel in case they do not have a coffee pot or anything else in the room.  It's very convenient to have some coffee and tea and a few snacks in the room with you.  They have the weighted food and drink in the room (if it's off the scale for a minute it's an automatic charge)  I don't go for that kind of thing.

Another thing I didn't really care for is the huge signs in the lobby that say your bags are subject to being searched for contraband (ie, outside food or drink...what is this a movie theater?)  For the record, that never happened and we followed in people carrying boxes of beer so I didn't feel to bad but, I mean really you are paying for the room so what is that all about?

There is an additional charge to use the pool and work out facilities which was included in our package.  The pool was beautiful and very relaxing.  The weather was the nicest on the last day so we maximized our time before check out at the pool.  I'm sure when summer comes it will be really jammed there but we had the are all to ourselves.

I did really enjoy the non smoking rooms and non smoking floors.  The ventilation in the casinos themselves was really good and not nearly as smokey as some of the older casinos.

The wi-fi was supposed to be free with the package but every time you tried to login you were not able to.  The 3G for ATT didn't work very well inside without it.  We could have investigated it, I suppose but I let it go.

I would like to say we'll be back but I'm thinking without some sort of great deal from Mr. Wynn, it will be out of my price range.",1,2,1

What a confusing trip I had to the encore this past weekend?!?! Taking a birthday trip with my girlfriend and some friends for the weekend thinking wow this is going to be great: the encore hotel, great food, great gaming, great dinning, great clubs, well......

Arrival typical friday evening travel a short flight over from San Diego. After checking in, we begin to walk through the hotel to hear people throughout the hotel speaking of NO HOT WATER! For a 5 star 5 diamond club hotel not to have hot water is ridiculous. They were right! Thanks for the preface at check-in that there was no hot water.  (First problem of the trip) Couldn't complain yet because when I called down to the front desk so many other people were complaining at the same time I could not actually get a live person on the phone and the machine prompted me to call back later (strike 2!). 

Next morning housekeeping used their key-card and entered our room without knocking. (Will spare the details of how bad that timing was).
(3rd service flaw) 

After that incident decided to say something to the hotel staff about the housekeeping incident and the hot water - comped $100. ($50 for each separate incident) Thinking maybe things are on the up!

4pm get hot water and finally shower. 

Ate dinner at their sushi restaurant Wazuzu. Food was good, service was poor again. (#4!) Ordering sake became the most complicated thing to do. Not sure exactly how it went down because I was so frustrated I gave up and let friends try and order. 

XS WAS AMAZING! EVERYONE GO THERE! Best club in Vegas
Only flaw, concierge closed at 9pm in Sin City, or a city ""that never sleeps"".  Well the concierge at the Encore definitely does.  Nothing sinister like happens in vegas before 9pm anyways?!?! Wanted to get hotel guest passes or ladies passes and unsuccessful at both because they were closed.

Sunday called down for 1pm late checkout after friends in room 3 doors down said they got 1pm late checkout. Called the front desk, Kelly said they were not offering 1pm late checkout to any of the guest. Well, after haggling with Kelly for 20-30 minutes she spoke with another gentleman, James, one of the managers, and agreed to offer 1pm late checkout. Admitted they actually did offered my friends a late checkout which she orgianlly said was not an option. (#5)

All in all, food was great. XS was great. Ambience and decor was great. Little on the pricey side for food and beverage, but service  was TERRIBLE. No one was helpful except for the bellman when we were leaving hahaha! Talk about a sign....

When what you control is who you hire to represent your hotel, Encore falls miserably short. And with word of mouth being best referral, I would stay somewhere else to avoid the service issues of staying here. Dine and go to XS and get out!",0,0,0

When in town, we always tend to party at XS, Surrender, & Encore beach club because they simply are some of the best clubs on the strip. Beautiful hotel with nothing but smiles all around, no doubt about that. 

We arrived on 5\/28\/16 for our 2 night stay & we were both looking forward to the activities we planned. Once we checked in, our room was great, it was a panoramic king suite on the 60th floor, I loved it. This wasn't going to be our usual partying weekends in Vegas, so I was ready to experience Encore like I've never had before. We skipped the usual party at the beach club because we don't really care for Avicii and I just wanted to relax. We went to the regular pools, which were pretty packed, we couldn't find chairs in the 21+ section, so we settled by the main area. It was relaxing, comfy tanning beds, we ordered salads & a pitcher of some vodka drink.. But the chicken in both salads were kind of hard and chewy, felt like it had been in the fridge for a while. Flavors were good, but I couldn't eat the chicken. 

Around 5 I had a reservation to get a blowout before my night started, at the Claude Baruk salon, the staff was great, it was fabulous inside, and my stylist was fun. It was all great, the champagne, and the products they use, but my actual blowout, ehh, I've had better plus it didn't even last all night. My curls were dull to begin with, I knew it wouldn't last but the experience was nice & I was content with that. 

Around 7:30 we went to Andrea's to have dinner, nice ambiance, & the drinks were good. The food was excellent until I found a piece of hair on one of the sushi rolls. Really? & It was a pretty long piece of hair at that. Nasty. Spending all that money to find hair on my food, I doubt I'll ever go back, I can go anywhere if I want to spend that much money to get disappointed. They didn't charge us for that specific roll, bla bla, doesn't matter the damage is done. 

Following dinner, we had tickets for La Réve, it's an entertaining show. 

I will not be reviewing the clubs, it's always a good time, plus we always get a table so there is really nothing to say. We went to Surrender Saturday night.

Next morning, room service breakfast was good, they were prompt, we ordered the salmon Benedict, pancakes, scrambled eggs, a smoothie & tea.... it was satisfying. 

Around 3 we went down to the spa for our couples massage, the spa itself is separated for woman & men, it is European style. We had scheduled 2 aromatherapy massages with the hot stone enhancement in a private room for both of us to be in. By the time we were changing to lay on the beds, the lady kept knocking on the door. Like dude, relax, we said 1 minute.. I was trying to take off my jewelry and it seemed like she just didn't want to wait. Not the best massage, it could have used some more work, but the oils were great, I was relaxed. Then we both went our separate ways inside the facilities, it's gorgeous, but the cold towels outside the sauna & steam room ran out. I tried to find someone to tell, nobody in sight. 30-40 minutes passed, still no cold towels. Really? I had to the use the ice from the bowl to cool myself off! I just left after that, & nobody even cared to ask about my experience. 

I had asked for housekeeping to take care of the room while we were gone, & ummm? I don't know what they did, just close the bed? Who cares. They didn't even restock anything in the bathroom or take the room service table. Why did you come? I don't get it. 

We skipped our dinner reservations & decided to stay in the room to relax. That night we had a table at XS. 

We never left Encore & Wynn, and we didn't need to. After thousands of dollars being spent on amenities, tables at the clubs, gambling & food, you would think the least they can do is take care of your car. We never drive to Vegas, ever! We just wanted to drive my brand new BMW from LA & I regret ever making that decision.

Valet is a joke. A bunch of hoodlums racing the cars up & down bumping music. Stupid little boys happy with other people's cars, speeding & braking so hard, I couldn't believe my eyes. Before my car arrived I was already mad at what I saw. Something told me check your car Christine, & of course, it's scratched. I was so furious, so furious, and I wasn't the only one! There was Another car damaged, unbelievable. 

Bottom line, there was hair in my anniversary dinner, I left the spa because I couldn't last in the sauna without the cold towels, housekeeping sucked, and my brand new car got scratched. Are you kidding, I'm pissed!! Thanks Encore!",13,6,0

4 stars because the food wasn't so good and the vibes at the tables in the casino were not so great. Also, it's on the edge of the strip so we were a little far from the center so getting to and from on an Uber\/Lyft\/Taxi was a drag during certain hours... there was lots of traffic! 

Stayed during Memorial Day weekend which traffic was expected but the Lyft took forever and racked up a high fee going a mile over to the Bellagio, so we decided to just head back. 

But our entire stay there, the service, and our room were excellent. Everyone was super nice and attentive.

The pool is actually a little small but really fun. It seemed pretty swarmed both days, but we didn't actually have any trouble getting seats. While we were there we hung out with our pals, Beyonce and Hugh Jackman (I got to swim with Wolverine!!), and we heard JT (Justin Timberlake) was on his way. This is just to point out, this place is HOT! Apparently XS is *the* club in Vegas right now...

I was in the Double Queen Suite and actually spent 2.5 hours napping in my ridiculously comfortable bed before a legendary dinner at Picasso (Bellagio). A siesta is *highly* recommended in your Encore bed, and you will need it after a day in the sun! I also had a really cool view of the strip. The room came with a living room and foyer area with huge mirrors, was perfect for three girls dressing up :) The room service was delicious, however the already added 18% gratuity was a little annoying. The only other thing was, there was no internet access in the room! We desperately wanted to twitter our fab weekend to make friends jealous, but couldn't!

Lastly, the Spa at Encore.
If you're a spa junkie (like me), do yourself a favor at make an appointment at this Spa. It's serene, tranquil, and a serious pampering session. It's not cheap, I got the Good Luck Ritual ($250 before gratuity) but its worth every single penny of it. There's a steam room, suana, dipping pools (a must) and waterfall showers. All of this is included with the spa service, or you can pay $30 for it

Branded as the cooler, hip sister of Wynn, Encore offers the same level of service, attention to detail and customer first mentality of its predecessor.  The difference between the two hotels is simply that one stands on the South end of the property and the other (Encore) is to the North....obviously there are some slight differences that I will cover below:


I've had the pleasure of staying at both Wynn and Encore and have noticed that Encore is quieter (except for one thing, to be discussed in a moment) and of a more relaxed feel than Wynn.  Located behind Wynn and a bit further North on the Strip means that the foot traffic in the Casino is far less than that of Wynn and the crowds are not a problem or a nuisance like they are at Bellagio or Venetian.  The Casino is surrounded by natural light and gardens near the pool and is a fantastic place to gamble and people watch both in the day and night.  Wynn's Casino can sometimes feel cramped and busy with all of the foot traffic, this issue is resolved at Encore, even at peak hours in the evening.


Where Encore does have large crowds is at Encore Beach Club which is an open to the public outdoor pool party venue with an enormous pool, private cabanas and tons of people (think Tao Beach at Venetian, multiply it by 5 and there you have Encore Beach Club).  The noise from Encore Beach Club, mainly the pounding base from the music represents Encore's only drawback and can be clearly heard even on the highest of floors (39-up) in Strip facing rooms.  The noise continues into the night well after EBC closes and then comes from XS nightclub which opens onto the pool at EBC.  While you should be up late since you're in Vegas, if by chance you do need a good nights sleep this can be a bit of a hassle.  It's far from a deal breaker or huge detractor from choosing this hotel, but it is a much complained about point from most guests.

The Standard Resort Suite at Encore is impressive to say the least!  At 700 sq. feet it is leaps and bounds ahead of it's nearest competitor, the Bella Suite at Venetian\/Palazzo.  The bathroom is enormous and decked out in fantastic marble and the main living area is separated by a half wall with a 40 inch flatscreen mounted on a pivot so you can enjoy it from either the bed or couch which is situated near the floor to ceiling window.  Just like at Wynn, the lights and drapes are electronically controlled and you get the pleasure of sleeping on the same Wynn Dream Bed found next door at Wynn.

Choosing between the two can be difficult, but if you're looking for a more low key, under the radar Vegas experience yet still crave the need to party and have a great time, Encore is the place for you.  Encore gives you the ability to be away from it all but at the same time is just a step away from the controlled chaos and fun that is Las Vegas!  You will not be let down if you choose to stay here, enjoy!",1,0,1

The Wynn is awesome and has been a five-star experience every time I stay in Vegas.  Understated elegance and attention to the small details is what has always set Mr. Wynn's properties apart from the rest.  Encore is a great hotel and is worth the stay but surprisingly comes up a little short on some of the small details which I found surprising.  
The great - 
Large room, nice flat screen, large bathroom, separate bath and shower, quality linens (all apply to the regular room).  The room is also well soundproofed from your neighbors.
The good -
The hotel feels like a much smaller hotel than it is.  Everything is grouped together and easy to find.  You don't have to walk a half a mile to get to everything.  This sounds minor but you really do notice it after awhile.  
The eh-
Valet pickup is absurd.  You have to walk from the front to the side of the hotel, down a narrow stairwell with your luggage, and wait for ten minutes for someone to bring your car.  The exit does avoid Las Vegas Blvd. however which saves you time.
Room service - two personal cheese pizzas and two orders of chicken lettuce wraps - $106.  I expect some markup but give me a break.  You also may not bring outside food up to your room.  You will be stopped at the elevator!  Hookers?  OK.  Drugs? OK.  Fast food takeout?  No dice.  Very, very disappointing.
Mini-bar restocking person: I'm sorry that your hand-held device did not show that we paid $100 for a late checkout Sunday, but you could be a little nicer to us after I explained what happened and not treat us like degenerate squatters staying past checkout time.

As much as Vegas prices have crept up over the years, there are very few places in the world where you can get a true resort experience for only a couple hundred a night. With a room at the Encore, you're getting the whole Wynn property, so even if Encore is ""smaller,"" the facilities should be considered together. Encore's interiors are a burst of powerful red, while the Wynn flutters out with its floral array of colors.  

ROOM: Beautiful view of the strip, the King suite is such a well-designed space, as comfortable as home but as swanky as a hotel can be. Easily my favorite room in Las Vegas (12 different hotels to-date). You realize how little it really costs to move up from a solid Vegas room to something truly luxe. 

POOLS: Enjoyed the Encore pool, but that Wynn pool! Gorgeous. 

BUFFET: I'd say the best but I haven't tried a couple of the more recently popular ones. Crab legs are amazing, fresh, and worth the spend, but too many dishes are ""just okay"" in buffet dining, even at Wynn. Spice Market at Planet Hollywood is much less expensive and I've found a wider variety of tasty items there, but the Wynn space is so elegant that my memories of eating here are better. 

TERRACE POINTE: Worked very well for us as a straightforward and, as expected, lovely looking cafe with a nice view. Stopped in for a delicious french toast late one morning. 

CASINO: The action at the Encore tended to feel empty and quiet, so we usually gambled on the Wynn side, where things were usually more lively. Beverage service is nearly non-existent, my only true ding on the service here.  

So after praising all the facilities, their beauty and class, I do have to note that despite the spaghetti and bikini straps ingressing and egressing XS and Encore Beach Club, the overall feel here is a bit stuffy, definitely money, and there's more of a cocoon-feel protecting the property from the roughnecks carousing down the Strip. I happen to be one of those roughnecks most of the time, and I appreciate the energy of being right in the middle of, you know, Amurrrica. That's the beauty of Vegas, though, which keeps me coming back to enjoy its highs and lows. Encore is definitely a high, if not the high.",2,3,1

This place left us so shook from the time We had step foot to the time We depart the entire time We had here was truly a 5 star experience like many had said. I have always wanted to stay here since it had opened back in 2008\/2009 but we never had gotten a chance cuz it was a luxury to have the money to stay here. Luckily enough We had singed up for a red card account a couple of years ago and just earlier on this year We had gotten a letter from the wynn that was a package deal for 2+ nights, 2 free buffets, and 2 tickets to la reve which was a really great deal in my opinion so we had decided this time to do it!! We booked for the half of the first week in July I was so excited. When upon the day for check in we gotten an email saying that if we wanted to upgrade to panoramic room and the kind lady at the front desk had gave us options of able-to-do upgrades (rather than doing the $20 trick)  we pick the panoramic strip view after all and boy that was really worth it cuz our room had one of the most spectacular views I had seen in my travels nothing compares to the view. The room itself was bigger my  room and had the best bathroom with even a tv!!! I mean who has that in their bathroom at home lol. There was silk robes, detail cleaning shower, it's own separate water closet (again a 5 star experience people). beds were comfy af and everything was automatically controlled and even the quality of the furniture was there even though that's a minor thing to focus on but still. Pools were heated and big as well with great service and nice people serving us. La reve was something else of its kind because the show was unique and the production was done very professionally with a lot of acrobatics and synchronize swimming. Now unfortunately there are a few downsides but not too many. 1 a loud thumping of the beach club I can still hear from the 30th floor (wasn't too loud it's just that it went on for a while) 2. Our room was right next to the elevators and we can hear it going up and down constantly. And 3. I know it's something that's not changeable but man!! there's so many godamn 21+ pool areas in this property like it only limits for me to limited access to certain pools and also I can't even walk a shortcut past the casino areas to get to our room quicker without some fatass gaurd\/security stopping me for some ID which is so extra. Regardless of my experiences Me and my dad still made the best out of it considering I still had 3 more years until now to finally be free. You see vegas for people who are in their late teens is kinda miserable for them mainly because ur an adult but not an a full adult yet to do all the fun stuff and that's what really frustrates me. The atmosphere of this property kinda gave that feel  to me too that I don't belong cuz I'm not 21 yet because of how intimidating it was. But the question is will return to this property? Yes and no. Yes because of the luxury 5 star experience, rooms, pool, food and the architectural design but a no because of how the atmosphere and feel doesn't feel very family- friendly you say.",3,2,1

Even some of our friends that hung out with us in our rooms ended up sleeping over since they were so comfortable with the space. I have stayed at other Vegas hotels over the years and I find Encore the best.

The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was check-in since it was overly crowded and took too long to get our rooms. Next time I will reserve a tower room if the price is right. Other than that, no complaints. We will definitely stay in Encore again.",4,2,3

First impression when walking into the hotel was wow. The place looked beautiful. The casino was nice and clean and very fun yet professional looking. Our room was a nice size and very modern. 
The main thing that we did not like about the hotel was the $750 deposit we had to pay upon check in. We were there on our honeymoon and that along with relocating across the us, we didn't have a ton of extra cash. But after going back and fourth we were able to have them only take a $250 deposit so we had more money to just give them anyway in there casino. Lol. The deposit is $150 per day.

The staff is friendly and will greet you as you pass by. The biggest problem we had during our stay is we got a smoking floor, so certain nights the hallway leading to our room smelled like an ashtray. Our room smelled pretty bad the first night, but I guess we adjusted to it, so it wasn't so bad after the first night. Also the rooms looked very nice and they even offered a couch just in case you weren't comfortable with spooning your best friends (we were all very comfortable doing this). The view was also very nice, though our window looked out to the Trump Hotel and the empty plot of land that will be the next hotel\/casino. 

The dealers were also very nice, though I suppose they are in the business of attracting players. One of my friends and I would always find the emptiest craps table and we'd always have a good time with the dealers. They let my friend and I continue betting $10 after they raised the minimum to $25 because we had been playing at the table for a while.

My girlfriend and I ordered a salad and Dumplings @ 3am. They told me over the phone that it was only going to take 30 to 40min. It took 60min and I was really upset. I mean if it was going to take that long, we would have just not ordered and went to sleep. When the food finally came, we of course gave the nice gentlemen our money, but needed change. He said that it was going to take 10min for him to come back with some change. Guess how long it actually took? Almost 1 hour. Jezz, again the nice man should have told us how long it was going to take. I called In Room-Dining twice and they promised that it's on it's way. The last time I called, they finally told me the truth about how my change will not get to my room shortly. They said they will quietly put it under the door. Basically, my girlfriend and I waited a total of 2 hours for our food and my stupid change. Finally, going to bed @ 5am in the morning with the rest of the girls. We get a suprise @ the door, it was security. The said that we were getting numerous complaints. They asked how many of us were actually staying in our room.

It was 5 in the moring, they couldn't wait until noon to kick us out??!!Good thing my sisters friend's boyfriend was staying @ Planet Hollywood so the two of my girls left and stayed there.

We were not going to pay another night and risk of getting kicked out.

Decor, atmosphere, cleanliness, and service are all at the top when compared to others.  It is all about luxury here, and there's plenty of shops like LV and Vertu to uphold that status.

The rooms here are great and all have a ground to ceiling window so you can see out of your room.  If you are able to get the front view, it is amazing as you can see down the Strip to the South.  It is spacious as well, and the super amazing bed... oh man... you will never want to get up.  

The pool is grandiose too.  At night, it serves as the place for XS but during the day, go down and mingle in the Euro-style pool or have a swim in the other.

Two super clubs here: XS and Surrender, both taking advantage of the pools around Encore.  Lines do get long so... prepare to wait if you come late!

Food option can be limited.  There's really nothing ""affordable"" here as most restaurants will cost you a pretty penny.  There is a sort of cafe near the walkway to Wynn but it's not that cheap either and the food isn't that great.  Just head over to the Wynn Buffet?

One thing I will knock against Encore\/Wynn is that their Red Club, which is the player's card, gives HORRIBLE comps.

We had our hearts set on staying at the Palazzo at the Venetian but the prices were really high and we didn't want to risk booking at the last minute so we went with a friend's recommendation for Encore, which was having a better promotion, and we were not disappointed.  The very first thing I noticed when I walked into the lobby was that everything was red: carpet, ceilings, even the chandeliers!  Encore's been open for about a year and it really shows as well.  Everything was spotless and I really liked the the modern decor.  

We booked the King Resort Suite where it overlooked the pools (yes, Encore has 2 pools...more about that later).  We loved the open layout of the suite.  The long hallway included the luxurious bathroom to the right with double sinks, a shower, a bathtub and of course the flat screen TV.  Continuing down the hallway there was a spacious closet which had a large dresser which was a great space saving touch and much needed for all of our things.  The bedroom and living area was divided by yet another dresser with a larger flat screen which could turn either way depending on where you wanted to watch.   

Now, about the pools.  Most hotels only have 1 pool and that pool is usually crowded with small screaming children and stressed out parents trying to keep them under control.  At Encore they have that pool, but they also have what's called the European Pool for adults over 21.  If I could only give one reason for coming back to Encore, it's because of the European Pool, which also doubles as the pool for the XS club at night.  I was greeted by nice pool staff who helped me to set up in a nice area by the pool and got my drink orders quickly.  Towels were also replaced efficiently so I always had a fresh one at hand.  I miss that pool so much!

It was also nice that Encore flowed pretty seamlessly into the Wynn where we enjoyed more wonderful food (more about that in reviews to come!).  Although we had our original misgivings since it is located pretty far from the middle of the strip, we found that we really enjoyed the quietness of its location and the ease of getting a free cab for the trips to other parts of the strip.

Additionally the No1DP stayed here for a week to attend a conference.

CASINO: The No1DP convinced me to step out onto the casino floor to try my luck at roulette. Over the course of 3 days I ended up +$58, which ended up paying for pizza. The first dealer we were with in the roulette table was very helpful in showing us how to play as we had a table to ourselves. They use separate chips for roulette (I guess to differentiate the betters?)

POOL: On the earlier stay with family we checked out the pool. I remember there were two sections - the regular pool and the 18+ topless pool. The regular pool was quite big and there were lots of chairs to spread out clothes. 

CHECK-IN: No hassle. All I had to do was show ID. I declined assistance from the bellhops. There is a $29 resort fee per night.

ROOM: The resort fee covers up to 3 devices. No1DP used all 3 devices so I had to use the cellular data plan for internet. Internet connection was decent at best, spotty at worst. No1DP also experience cellular data problems at his end. 

Bed was comfortable, second to the Palazzo in terms of sleep comfort. Kudos that the TV is across from the bed. There are two power connections per side to charge phones.

There's a control panel on the left that controls everything from the privacy settings, temperature settings, lighting settings and window settings. 

Living room had comfortable couches. The main phone sits on the desk instead of being next to the bed.

BATHROOM: One of the bigger bathrooms with a separate shower and tub and an Asian-style setting where the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom. Toiletries offered are good for standard American toiletries.

IN-ROOM DINING: Waste of money. I got the Chinese Breakfast and the No1DP got the Japanese breakfast, $39\/platter. I got what amounts to a bland congee, no matter how much spicy sauce, soy sauce and vinegar I dab or if I put all my green onions. The century egg was just too gelatinous and I only ate half my eggs (usually I *love* hard boiled eggs in soups). Shu mai was the best of the breakfast but only decent when compared to traditional dim sum. No1DP's salmon had hints of ginger and his miso soup was decent but we had a better Japanese breakfast prepared at the Palazzo.

The Encore is my second favorite room in Vegas. My favorite is still the Palazzo at the Venetian|Palazzo complex. The Palazzo boasts a bigger room (standard room is a suite), there are more dining options and it is more centrally located along the Strip.

A bit ago, me & j went on a LV trip- first time going with an other without a group of my girls (was sad they werent there!)

Truth is, I dont really know how to gamble. I hate buffets. So for a person like me, i go to Vegas for the lavish hotels, morning mojitos, the tricked out pools, and the like. Encore provided just that. Anyone that has walked through Encore knows that the colorful interior with the mosaic tiles and slightly asian inspired (subtle) decor makes for sophisticated without crossing the line over to gaudiness.

The spa lounge area (can see it when one is crossing over to the XS pool area) is soo pristine- i wished my gfs to be there- they would have gotten excited about it more than J! The pool itself has two sections. One is directly connected to the spa and on the other side is the European style ""xs pool"" - although we didnt see more than 3 brazen topless women, it was a big area for sunning and playing blackjack (same area they do at nighttime at the club)


As for the rooms, we had requested a ""quiet suite"" since Encore is known to have loud music coming from XS at 4 in the morning.. so we got a north facing room.. Not the greatest view (just small strip plaza) but the King Suite (which is the smallest room at Encore I believe) was pretty spacious for 2 people.

Another thing- I dont know if anyone else notices but the music they constantly play in the casino is by Kaskade. I've heard at least 3 Kaskade songs during this stay and I remember hearing her 3 years ago when i was in this hotel as well- and i actually went home to look up who this artist was- and has made a permanent spot on my ipod playlist. For those that know of this artists work, it adds a serene element to the casino.

One of the only negatives to Encore\/Wynn properties.. they are so damn far from everything else! We spent most of the trip at this hotel (except for the dinner\/show which we cabbed to Bellagio- but the cab driver insisted taking some freeway looking road to get from Encore to Bellagio due to traffic ??)

They sometimes send deals over- one that i got in the mail which was 3 nights for 300 (incl weekends)- Except J threw it away and we didnt get to use it! So if you get one in the mail, take the offer! This place will be worth your stay.",7,3,3

Honestly, even after a cool down period, I can't find anything bad to say about Encore\/Wynn hotel and casino. Everything was a class act. The room was fantastic and $25 per night to upgrade to a 56th floor strip view??? Best $75 I have spent in a while. The room was very clean and comfortable and the bathroom was way nice too. The casino actually smelled nice and we swear that cleaning people drop from the ceiling the second something is dropped or disrupted. Could hardly find a cigarette but in an ashtray. Staff was super helpful and responsive. Bartenders were friendly and competent. The decor and the overall atmosphere was very swanky, even the music they play is nice jazzy, rat pack type stuff. Again, no complaints, but be forewarned, any deal you find on the room rate (and I got a deal), is not representative of anything else in the hotel.  There are no great deals to be had on bar drinks, meals or even coffee. This is to be expected, after all, it's a 5 star hotel. We did eat at two of the hotel restaurants, Society Cafe and Red 8, not bad, but not  inexpensive. Also,  if you want a quick cup of coffee and breakfast nosh without spending $40, there are two Starbucks across the street  in Fashion Island. Walgreens (with jacked prices) and a liquor store are right up the street to the north. Don't plan on being in Vegas again for a few years, but when I do, I will be back at one of the Wynn properties.",1,0,2

Massive windows. Gorgeous bathroom. Supersized L-shaped couch and large coffee table (very handy for propping a hooker on & snorting coke from her ass-cheeks through a straw. Oops.

The arrival experience was well orchestrated.  The valet attendant welcomed us to the Encore as soon as the car came to park, and the bell attendant immediately took our luggage and escorted us to the front desk. 

Front desk attendants were genuine and friendly.  Everyone at the property knew the resort, and its amenities.  At the end of our stay, the bellman lost our luggage but retrieved the items within 20 minutes.  

Bellmen were friendly and proud to work at the Wynn.  They were not gratuity and transactional driven like other resorts, and spent time ensuring the guest knew the room, and amenities.  One bellman even showed us how to take the perfect picture of the Las Vegas Strip without a flash and glare against the floor to ceiling windows. 

Room service was quick, and was set up like a meal presentation in a fine dining restaurant.  Within 20 minutes from placing the room service order, the order was delivered and food items to the perfect temperature. 

Spa was well stocked with assorted juices, fruit, and water.  The Spa at Encore is an impressive facility and takes guest into an escape unlike any other.  The spa was a nice size and included three wet Jacuzzis, showers and sinks fully stocked with amenities, steam room and sauna.  The living room featured televisions, and assortment of magazines.  Service met expectations, and facilities were constantly cleaned.  

Hotel came busy at night after 10:00pm with the Surrender nightclub and XS nightclub just a few moments away from the hotel elevator.  During the evening, the music even in the elevator was nightlife like.  If you want to have more of a classic luxury resort experience, I would highly recommend staying next door at Wynn Las Vegas. 

Overall, I would revisit the Encore Tower Suites.",4,1,1

* This is NOT the place to stay if you're not there to go clubbing. I was here with my husband for a quiet birthday weekend and to catch some shows. Every night we walked to our hotel we were swimming upstream through obnoxious brats on their way to the club. Girls in crazy heels not watching where they're going, rolling 4-5 deep, too drunk and awkward on their heels to move in a graceful manner, and guys just, well there.
* Upside, our room was low floor with a cr@p view but relatively quiet. Didn't hear any club noise - and only occasional noise from the room next door
*I liked our room overall, nice size, comfortable bed, nice understated decor
* Room wasn't QUITE as clean as I would have liked. Couch was dusty...wtf? I ended up putting towels across the seats.
* Like many other hotels, we had to pay the resort fee, so we just used our WiFi like the wheels were going to fall off :)
* Hubby's a picky eater so he wasn't feeling most of the restaurant options, until we got to the Wynn Buffet. I've never seen his eyes light up over food like that before. The buffet was awesome and a great way to end our trip.
* I thought the location was going to be a huge minus being somewhat far up the street, but it was perfect. Great proximity to the bus stations (Fashion Mall(?) stop) so super easy to get the lower part of the Strip as well as Fremont Street.

Also, the business center was closed but the Concierge printed our boarding passes. The staff is super nice and helpful with choosing menu items and providing directions. 

Encore is at the end of the strip so depending on what you want to do or where you want to go... The pools were ok... not a lot going on at them and the big thing is getting a reserved seat by the pool or renting a Cabana. We didn't have too big of a problem finding lounge chairs for 2.",2,2,1

Negatives:   

(1) Moderately Competent Overall Staff - Upon arrival in mid-November, we inquired about the pool situation, and whether or not there was a hot tub or Jacuzzi available.  The person at the front desk said no.  Only after we ventured down to the pool area did we discover that they did in fact have a hot tub.  One would think that the front desk person would know whether or not they have a hot tub on the premises?  I'm sure the question comes up from time to time with guests.

(2)  Outside Windows to Suites are NOT Sound Proof - It would be nice to have the option of going to sleep before 4am.  Unfortunately whoever designed the suites neglected to consider their proximity to the XS nightclub, and that many guests may not want to experience the club's music in their suite.  The constant pounding of bass into the early morning hours is not something I would expect for a $400.00 a night accommodation!  I'm sure I'm not the only person that has complained about this.  They should have at least forewarned guests about this problem.  This is unacceptable for a hotel that claims a have a five star rating.

(3) Do Not Breath Or Touch The Mini Bar - I was informed to not go anywhere near the mini bar or it may result in charges.  Well, we followed these rules exactly, and didn't even open the mini bar during our stay.  Later on I discovered four separate mini bar charges on my bill for doing nothing.   When I contacted the Encore to reverse the charges they obliged.  But seriously, for not evening opening up the mini bar this is pretty absurd.  They likely have sensors on the snacks that are in plain view upon entry into the suite.  So if you're considering a stay at the Encore don't even breathe or look at the mini bar.  You may find charges on your bill.

Positives:

(1) Good Selection of Restaurants - We dined at La Cave and Okada Restaurant each night.  The experience with both restaurants was very good.  I'd give each restaurant 4 stars for the service and quality of food.  

(2) Beautiful Pool - The pool was comfortably warmed, well-constructed, and in close proximity to the hot tub which I'd suggest the front desk person try out some time.  There is also a pool bar to take advantage of.

(3) Onsite Gym  - They have an ample selection of treadmills and stair masters, a convenient juice bar to order smoothies, and the option of enrolling in fitness classes.  

All and all, I'd have to give the Encore a 3 star rating.  It's far away from the strip which is a bit of a hassle, but the overall dining and entertainment experience was good.  I likely won't stay there again in the future, opting towards the Bellagio or Venetian.  Steve Wynn may own those hotels as well...;o)",0,0,0

And I REALLY love Vegas when I get to stay at Encore.

Wow, where do I begin? How about the classy decor, the butterfly tiles, the rich red carpet and fragrant fresh flowers that make a busy casino actually smell GOOD?!

The food is delicious - room service, Society Cafe, Switch, Stratta for your post-party pizza binge (think that's technically at Wynn but close enough).... you seriously can't go wrong. 

XS is my all-time favorite night club, and with top DJs like Calvin Harris regularly spinning in this glamorous, stunningly beautiful poolside setting, it's no wonder why it's almost always packed. I had one of the best times of my club-going life at Encore Beach Club 4th of July weekend during Kascade's set. So many good memories at this hotel!

The rooms are fantastic - they are all suites so there is plenty of room for pre-party drinking and shopping-bag storage. Big, comfy beds, nice seating areas and flat-screen TVs = great for lounging and sleeping off that hangover. Large, well-lit  bathrooms create a pleasant environment for make-up application. 

I have never had anything except exceptional service at Encore. My mom, sister and I always stay at Encore for our girls weekends because we feel so pampered and special here! 

My only complaint is I like this hotel so much I'm always a little disappointed when I have to stay elsewhere. That and for some reason I'm NEVER up for even 5 minutes when I sit down at the gambling tables. Oh well, plenty of other activities to keep me busy at this hotel.

Writing this review is basically guaranteeing that the next tab I open in my browser is going to involve checking prices for my next Vegas get-a-way.

Side note- The machines here are wound tighter than a clock. After you lose your first $200 and don't get the slightest reaction from any machine you will understand what I'm saying.

My wife and I try to go somewhere other than Vegas every year, but this hotel keeps us coming back. 

The rooms are very, very nice, and I love that each one of them has a view of the strip. One thing to keep in mind is that the ""Strip Facing"" rooms also face the nightclubs, so if the soft pounding of the bass will keep you up at night, you may want to consider asking for a room facing the other direction, which I am sure still offers a decent view. I really can't say enough about the rooms. The bedding, the lighting, the drapes and sheers, and the robes. For real though, I could write an entire review on the robes. They are a heavy material that is softer on the inside than a chinchilla, and silky on the outside. Most likely the most comfortable thing I have EVER worn on my body. You can buy one from the Wynn store to take home with you if you would like, at a price.

The pools are absolutely incredible. We love the adult pools. Yes, you do end up seeing a bunch of topless women that you would rather leave their tops on, but the lack of splashing and running children and the exclusivity of Encore guests only makes this pool an intimate attraction that you will have a hard time finding elsewhere. Unlike other pools, the waitresses come to you and offer up just about anything you could possibly want from cocktails to nachos. They have it all, at a price. 

I will not say much about the food, simply because my wife and I try to eat as little as we possibly can at Wynn restaurants. If you aren't careful, you can easily double you room charge simply by eating at their restaurants. I will say that the experiences we have had were pleasant. The buffet is very, very good for a buffet style meal, but keep in mind they are very picky about the dress code. No tanks for men and no sheer cover-ups for women, learned that the hard way, two years in a row. Other dining on Wynn property is good, but expect a very modest amount of food for a very high price. Mr. Wynn would like you to think that you are eating elegantly, when in reality, he just wants you to buy more. Simply put, dining is very good, at a price.

Lastly, we finally saw a show this year, and I am sorry we waited this long! Le Reve was unreal. I have seen a number of Cirque du Soleil shows and Le Reve was hands down the best show I have seen on the strip. The acrobatics and the strength required to do what they do is truly phenomenal, and the overall production is better, in my opinion than other similar offerings. I am also happy to say that at $115 a ticket this was available at a reasonable price!

Now that you are sold on the hotel, let me offer the few cons that I have noticed over the years. Expensive. As with any excellent service, you are going to pay for it. The room is only a fraction of the cost if you plan to take advantage of everything Wynn\/Encore has to offer. A bottle of sunscreen will cost you $30 to give you an idea. Secondly, they do not have a fridge in room, and do not offer have an option for in-room coffee. If you want a fridge you will have to request it and it will cost you another $25 a night.

In a nutshell, the Wynn\/Encore is a gorgeous property, with incredible attention to detail and fresh flower arrangements everywhere. You are treated very well, and you get a little taste of the high life while you are there, at a price. I can't wait to go back.",0,0,0

The room was also nice, but very uncomfortable due to the crappy air conditioning unit.  The room has one ac unit located by the windows, and it is not able to cool the bed side of the suite.  My wife and I woke up covered in sweat with all the covers tossed off in the floor after just a couple hours of sleep.  The tv was on a swivel so that it could be watched from the bed or the couch on the other side, however it wouldn't hold it's place and kept swinging back around to face the bed.  

The staff was friendly enough, but the whole place is ""snotty""...for lack of a better term.  Everything is EXTREMELY overpriced.  I decided to purchase a couple cigars to smoke while gambling.  I made my way into the little shop downstairs and asked the cashier for two Romeo Y Julieta's (my usual brand, that usually cost around $8.50 to $10.50 each), and when she stated that my total was over $50.00 I was certain I heard her wrong.  I didn't.  $25 each for cigars that I can buy anywhere else in town for $10.  That's not capitalism, that's just mean man!  Stay away from the Wynn\/Encore.

Upon arriving, I was greeted by a tiresome, 40 minute wait to check in. The staff were apologetic and passed waters around, but nonetheless, the usually efficient process to get a room key was overshadowed by the long line. I never want to wait 4 mins for anything. (I pull out of gas stations when there is a line.  I take items out of my basket to make quick check-out in the grocery store). So the 40 minute wait pretty much  marred my arrival at Encore.  I understand that it was a holiday weekend.  I also understand that people like to party it up in the city.  Since there were beach parties at several of the clubs, I had to play dodge the drunkies a few times.  Also, there were large swimsuit-clad groups blocking the way across the esplanade.  I pretty much don't stay at MGM or New York just to avoid this! I also don't want to hear club music from my room, but at least the latter days of my stay were far calmer in the hotel and I could have a more relaxing trip.

The best part are the rooms which are spacious and simple. Luckily,  I booked far enough in advance during a promotion that the rates were far lower than what I usually pay.  I noted that they changed their toiletries from the lemongrass scent (that was strangely similar to cleaning product) to a far more pleasant vanilla coconut blend.  There were ample towels.  The pillows were firm, but fluffy and my room was super clean!  I still enjoy this hotel and the fact I can walk to the mall across the way as well as the shops in Palazzo easily.  Another plus is that their Red Card program is pretty good in terms of comping (buffets, show tickets, game credit, hotel rooms) if you gamble there.",6,2,3

The bed was very comfortable. The first evening we were in the casino we learned that the Wynn\/Encore does not comp drinks when playing machines at the bar. 

The bartender was embarrassed telling us this. Now I know the economy is tough, but really? He further explained that they serve cocktails to players on the casino floor, not at the bars. I was playing out on the floor, never was offered a drink. I guess the cocktail waitress for the entire casino was on break. However, we were propositioned by two hookers that evening at a bar at the Encore. Asked us if we needed company for the evening. Guess the economy is tough when they proposition the gay guys. 

At the pool during the day, it was nice. However, by Friday the ghetto was arriving and the music switched to gangster rap. This was annoying also. 

We got propositioned again at a bar in the Wynn on the second night. Again, did we want company for the evening?

Saturday morning while drinking coffee at the coffee bar near the elevators at the Encore, the working girls started coming down around 6:30 AM. It was amusing to watch. Guess the night shift had ended and they were heading home. 

You wouldn't expect a place like the Wynn\/Encore to be OK with this, but clearly they are or it would cease. We usually stay at the Palazzo when in Las Vegas. It was full, so we went to the Wynn\/Encore. We have never experienced the hooker situation at the Palazzo\/Venetian.

First time I shared the room with 3 other girls and it wasn't cramped at all!  2 girls on the bed and 1 girl on the L couch and we ordered a comfy cot!  The bathroom space is amazing because of her his and her sinks. 

When I come here I'm excited to pack light because it comes with everything.  Comfy robes to wear when getting ready, ipod dock, iron, a safe, vanity mirror, good little soaps, shampoos, conditioners, etc. 

You think that would be standard for a Vegas hotel room but trust me its not.  I've stayed at the crappiest- nicest.  This one belongs on the nicer side. 

This is also the hot place to stay because XS is the new ish club.  Staying at Encore allows me to pre party and walk downstairs to my room after to continue the party. 

Their are also great Craps tables RIGHT in front of the elevator to get my gambling on. 

If you are new to Vegas and you gamble remember to go to Casino host before checking out to see how much they can comp you.  I did learn that its not the hours you play but its really based on how much you lose.. and then they will consider what to comp you.  I won this last weekend so they told me that they don't usually comp anything for that but they will so that was nice. 

Lots of nice restaurants to try and if it nothing tickles your fancy at Encore- which I doubt then you can mosey on over to Wynn where they have their buffet and other great restaurants. 

I can't say anything bad about this place at all.  I don't even mind that its at the other part of the strip near Circus Circus.  Its just amazing.  You just want to take a picture with everything!  I'll spare you guys those pictures but I will upload a few. 

Looks for deals online- they are always advertising.  We stayed for holiday weekend for 189 a night and on Sunday it was 119.  Not bad compared to the 300 to 400 they usually charge.",2,2,2

From the design and aesthetics of their grand lobby, with beautiful floral arrangements and green trees, to the spot free and perfection-like cleanliness across the entire property; our stay at Encore put a smile on our face as we explored the property even further.

We spent considerable time in the resort, knowing how crazy the strip would be around the holiday weekend. This was a wise decision, as there was plenty of time to relax and soak in what Wynn and Encore has to offer.

From previous experiences staying at the Wynn, we noticed that all rooms have somewhat of a nice view. But depending on your preference, you can either have a strip view (which we always opt for), or the golf\/mountain view which has more of a scenic view (sunset and distant mountains).

The casino on the Encore side is smaller compared to Wynn, but it also allows a more relaxed and less hectic, tourist prone area to gamble in, since many people that visit the Wynn from the strip don't exactly know about the Encore side, or they simply miss the passage that goes through Wynn to Encore.

And, as an added bonus, staying at the Encore allows you to enter the pool, as well as the pool at the Wynn. However, staying at the Wynn does not allow you to enter the Encore pool. The pools are heated, so even though it was mid-December desert weather, the pools were nice and toasty. Perfect for a mid-day swim as the sun was perfectly hitting all the spots in and around the pool.

As for other amenities, Encore is absolutely fantastic and the service is just up there as a 5 star hotels you'd expect anywhere else in the world. However, Vegas being Vegas, it appears that the hotel personnel sometimes gladly go the extra mile to put a smile on your face.

We have tried multiple dining spots inside the Wynn and Encore properties, and can attest to the quality and service they all provide. This time around, we ate at The Buffet (for the n'th time), serving a holiday dinner, as well as Jardin, which has a panoramic view of the Encore pool, with its relaxed atmosphere, offering breakfast, lunch and dinner. Casual elegance at its best.

At Jardin Restaurant they gave us the biggest grief about our stroller. Wouldn't even allow it on the patio. We have an infant for gods sake do you just expect me to hold her during breakfast? At the pool we accidentally drifted into the 21+ plus zone (a hideous looking construction btw and nothing ""European"" abt it)... We didn't see the signs.

At the price offered, this was a very good deal for an breathtaking room. The grounds are also really elegant, and the adults only pool is a great retreat from the family atmosphere I hoped to avoid.

At every turn, service at the Encore was excellent--from check-in to check-out. The staff was helpful, attentive, and very friendly. Only a few gripes:

- Wait for the taxi stand was often 20+ minutes. Don't even think of jumping the line or they'll bust a cap in your ass. Also, it's near the end of the strip so be prepared to pay at least $10 to go just about anywhere.
- When the pool area got busy the staff--while very friendly--didn't keep up. We often waited 15-20 minutes for a cocktailer to come by and then another 15+ minutes to get our drinks--which were crazy expensive. (Expect to pay $16 for a margarita and $50+ for a pitcher without tip.)
- You can easily spend a weekend in Vegas and never leave the Wynn\/Encore complex. However, outside of the room, just about everything was expensive... not a little bit--a LOT. It's ingenious that they get you to come there with a cheap room. Trust me, they make up the cash while you're there.

Having said that, I should say that the Encore really isn't about traveling on a budget anyway. It's about immersing yourself in a Vegas fantasy of luxury, opulence, and service. And on that note it definitely delivers. Just be prepared to pay for the privilege.",1,1,1

I have stayed on this side of the resort a couple times. During the past Valentine's Day decided to stay in the tower suites for a decent fee upgrade. The room is completely identical to the encore room I think they remodeled the carpet and the sofa.

It was not worth the upgrade because the separator between encore resort tower and tower suites was never closed. So it didn't feel like a special experience.

The hike walking from encore to Wynn tower pool  isn't painful but I don't enjoy walking thru two casinos in swimwear. The special tower pool was open to all guests during the time i stayed there.

If I'm splurging in the future for something special id prob just get a larger suite forget the standard tower room unless your in Wynn tower.

The free breakfast is a marketing ploy that is poorly explained. You get like $30 a day towards room service in the encore tower. The fees, Tax and typical menu item is $50 for one person.

The hotel itself is very impressive, the decor is amazing and so well thought out. The hotel is fairly new so doesn't have that haggard look but actually they've kept it up well. The casino is open and airy (not smokey at all) and somehow doesn't feel as claustrophobic as other casinos in Vegas. The rooms are great! Very modern with mirrors everywhere and clean lines. Remote control drapes and sheers as well as lights. We stayed in a king suite so had the benefit of a separate living room with a couch. It was nice to be able to have a pregame cocktail without having to sit on a bed. The bathroom was gorgeous, double sinks, large tub, shower with two heads and lots of nice bath products (although the shampoo and conditioner could be upgraded). I laughed when I read another reviewers comment about the toilet being too high, I felt the same way! Like a little kid with my legs dangling! The toilet is a little aggressive too when you flush, but who's complaining?? The pools are nice. They have options, you can go to the family pool or the ""European"" pool (bikini tops optional). You can also use pools at Wynn. The younger crowd pools are fun with pumping music and hot bodies everywhere. The family pools are more relaxing and peaceful. Both have free water and towels and plenty of servers to bring you a cocktail, although you'll pay dearly for it! I will say the pool areas are lacking good food options, all of the items on the menu are premade sandwiches and salads and didn't appeal to me. The restaurants inside the hotel are great, although again pretty pricey (what do you expect??). They all have an Asian flair but the two we ate in, Wazuzu and Wing Lei were great! The crowd is younger on the weekend and apparently XS and Tryst are two of the hottest clubs in town so be prepared to see a bunch of young girls in too short dresses and walking around barefoot after they gave in to their 6 inch platform heels (yeah I'm not bitter!

Pluses:
Package\/pricing: we got a great deal at $139\/weekend night (before resort fees + taxes) including $75 food credit and 2 Le Reve show tickets.
Room: Amazing view when we upgraded for $35\/night. Clean room, nice lounge area, large bathroom. 60th floor of 63 floors.
Room service: friendly staff, they brought a fold-out table for us to dine in.

Negatives:
When we were looking for lotion, there wasn't any (quite odd for this level of hotel). I opened the drawer, the one with the Bible, there were TWO CONDOM wrappers: one opened, one unwrapped.
Shower: apparently our shower was leaking water into outside area, made the door are very damp, the housekeeper found out and called hotel engineer. They asked when we will be leaving the room, I said in about 90 minutes; instead concierge called us within 10 minutes to have the engineers to investigate. The engineers were friendly and had let us know that we need to move room as we no longer can turn the water on for this room.
We moved room two floors up to 62nd floor. Room had similar view - similar format. No condom wrappers found this time.
LE REVE tickets? Well, the show was dark during this weekend. They could not let us have these tickets for another date, therefore they gave us $50 in resort credit to use.
DISAPPOINTMENT: at least 3 different times the staff had to double-check to make sure that Le Reve was dark this weekend. There was clearly a SIGN at the entrance of the check-in area to inform guests.
Even more disappointing: one person was looking for confirmation through a package of paper... aren't we in the digital industry?
$50 RESORT CREDIT: oh of course we used it, they did not apply it automatically, they had to make a phone call to their manager to confirm this is indeed true, and then they manually took this off.

I received an email with an offer to stay there for $129 a night and I couldn't refuse. Come on, to stay at a 5 Diamond Resort at that price: FUCK YEAH!

When you first walk in, all you notice is red. Red red red red... EVERYWHERE. But it's done in a really elegant way and I like that. The suites themselves are clean, the beds are comfy, the tv and the room phone has your name on it, the pillows are great to rest your head on after a wild night of drinking, and the staff - at least from my experience - work hard to really treat you well and make sure you're taken care of. 

The Spa itself is in a class on its own. Prior to visiting Encore, I've never been in one nor have I ever paid for a massage and I'm glad that the Spa at Encore took my spa virginity from me. I always thought it was just for girls. Upon stepping off the elevator, once you reach the Spa, you feel as if you've stepped through a portal and into a distant land. There's soothing music and even the way the receptionists at the desk talk, it's as if they're high or something. Like a mellow, soothing kind of high, not one of those ""Dude, I'm so high... let's go get some burgers"" kind of high, I swear! The massage and the scented oils were awesome and I attribute coming up about 2K because of that. Yes, I'm a superstitious gambler. I now never leave Encore without doing a couples massage with the girlfriend.

As for the actual gaming floor itself, don't expect anything massive; I like to think of it as cozy. It's not big but it's fine for people like me who try to avoid large crowds and appreciate easy access to the elevators to get to your room. 

What I do enjoy is that because it's connected to the Wynn, it's easy to walk to XS or Tryst. HOLLA!!! The walk to the club is easy; it's the walk back to your room that's tricky. Especially after you've had shot after shot and beer after beer enter through your liver. Hahaha...

There have been a few that have tried to challenge the standing of the Encore and Wynn, like new comers, ""the Cosmopolitan"", and ""The City Center"", but when it comes to true luxury, world class cuisine, exclusive clientele, Steve Wynn continues to lead and raise the bar a little higher than the rest. 

This all suite hotel is home to some of the hottest clubs on the strip.  XS and Encore Beach Club featuring some of the hottest DJ's from around the world.  I was here for a intimate party at the Beach Club with Deadmau5, as well as the residency with Steve Aoki at XS, (one of the biggest club nights at the property).  

The Spa at the Wynn is also amazing.  Make sure that you spend a few hours there, you won't want to leave.  They have couches and fireplace that you can stay and relax while sipping on water with lemon slices.  

Once you're done with the spa, what's next?  Back to your suite?  Hit the shops?  Take your chances at the High Roller's Table?  The options are endless....

Steve, you've really outdone yourself.",1,0,0

1. Not the best place with those traveling with kids under 18.    When the beach club is open, there is really no dress code for those heading to the pool.  Although your teenage boy might enjoy the women walking down the halls with skimpy bathing suits with six inch heels and bad language, you might not.
2.  Same applies to night time with those waiting for the clubs to open.
3. Thought is was funny that they had hosts at the double doors opening them for people but they were 15% successful in doing so.
4. Thought it was odd that housekeeping started their rounds approx 9am then stuck a card on the door that they were unable to clean the room.  Come on guys this is Vegas. Who gets up before 9 am!
5. Don't buy at the shops.  There is a huge markup. For example a meat slicer sold for $510.00 in the home store but when I red lasered it on my iPhone I found it for $375... 
6. If you want a cheap meal, go across the street at the food court at the mall.  You won't really find one here.",1,1,0

On our last Vegas trip, we stayed at the Wynn, but definitely prefer staying at Encore now.  Their customer service is excellent and they're always trying to please their guests, which is always a plus in my book.  Once you stay at the Wynn or Encore, you'll seriously never want to stay elsewhere.

Also, I love their 21+ pool because there are no kids running around or screaming.  It's ""European style"" which means that some women are topless.  It's pretty classy but there are a few people who treat the pool area as though they're on a college spring break (i.e. pouring beer down a girl's chest while motor-boating them).  Also, the pool gets packed pretty quickly so it's wise to get there before noon or else you'll have to settle for the other pool with the kids.

I walked over to the other pool area - it was much smaller and a lot more crowded. The gambling minimums were lame and the bartender gave my BF an attitude because he forgot his ID at the other pool, so he didn't want to serve him. Funny because he's well past legal drinking age. After that incident and the area nothing to hang around for, we went back to the other side and drank with abandon.

I was bummed because I was sharing the room with 3 others and didn't want anyone to sleep on the floor.  A few hours later, another friend of ours checked in under the same reservation (we booked a total of 3 rooms) and they were able to give her a double bed room.  I assumed its because one double bed room just freed up.  Anyway, I immediately went down to request a change and the person behind the counter said they were none available.  I persistently kept asking him, are you sure? are you sure?  Finally, he disappeared in the back for 5 minutes and finally came back with a double bed room for us.  Anyway, if they tell you there aren't any double bed rooms available, make sure you're pushy because they do!  They are probably trying to save it for those that are willing to pay premium for it.

The hotel is very similar to the Wynn (same owner).  The tv in my bathroom didn't work and I requested for someone to come fix it twice and no one did.

We weren't bombarded with slots as soon as we walked in. Sorry to sound like a snob, but the here crowd is a couple of notches above those at e.g. Circus Circus or Imperial Palace.
We don't like being lied to or jerked around, which is what happened. We requested a room on the same floor as our friends who arrived the day before, ""Nothing is available at this time,"" we were told. We asked that they try and in the mean time we'd camp out with our friends. An hour later - nothing. After waiting longer, our friend pulled rank and got us a room not only on the same floor, but next door - it had been vacant the whole time!
We were in a suite, nice view of not much to the north. Loved the remote control drapes and lamps. Being charged for use of the refrigerator is a cheap shot. Our mattress was lumpy. Housekeeping was impeccable. We left a lot of money on the tables - the dining room tables! There's no bargains eating or drinking. Come on, two drink minimum at the piano bar!

When using a taxi, do NOT us the name ""Wynn"" for chance of being taken to the hotel next door - just say ""Encore."" Speaking of being taken by the taxis, watch out for ""Do you want to take the quick route or the scenic route?"" or ""The traffic on the Strip is horrible, shall I take the highway?""

I thought to myself, hey this is perfect -- Encore is probably similar to Palazzo, a quieter version of their counterpart hotel. Well, there were quiet a few mishaps during our stay. 

The first thing I like about this hotel is the plentiful amount of self-parking. It's probably because most people are either valet, or don't care to visit the Encore. You have to admit -- for the casual middle-aged Vegas tourist or local, there's really not much to do. But for the rest of the Friday\/Saturday night crowd, Encore is it (ahem, Encore Beach Club and XS).

For my wife and I, hey, we wanted to celebrate our anniversary with a relatively quiet getaway. The front desk clerk gave us the mountain view and said that room would be quiet compared to the Strip view. During our stay, it was reasonably quiet but there were still late-night moments of thumping and beat pounding reverberating throughout the walls. I basically fist pumped to sleep.

For the most part, it was all good, and we went with the flow. But there were other details about the room that seemed off. There was a huge, brown ""poop"" stain smack dab in the middle of our window -- good thing it was on the outside. But it was still an eye-sore. There was also a band aid slapped on the smoke detector -- I'm sure the previous guests were smokin' it up (in a non-smoking room).

Then there was an incident where these two inebriated dudes followed me to my room from the elevator. They were smoking in a non-smoking floor. They said they just wanted to say hello and introduce themselves to me. It was all very suspicious and shady, and I gave them the crazy eye and tick -- basically telling them not to f$&k with me, especially when I'm dead tired and down from blackjack. They were smart and picked up on it, so they left. Who knows what they were up to. I called security to let them know that they weren't doing a very good job of checking people if they had their room key.

Overall, our stay wasn't horrible but it wasn't spectacular either. I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay for the rooms, because that would just be highway robbery. Funny, I found myself thinking about the Venetian\/Palazzo hotel rooms during our stay here. My wife and I still had a great Vegas trip.

No complaints with the housekeeping staff, they were quick and efficient and cleaned my room early which is helpful when I come back between appointments to rest or freshen up.

The problem areas are the pool, the restaurants, and the front desk. The pools chairs are taken up quickly, they were all gone by 10AM on Saturday in the European Pool (and it had opened just after 9AM despite a posted 8AM opening).

The restaurants are horribly understaffed, even the nice ones, so despite good tasting food the service is very spotty, empty plates linger too long, water & coffee isn't refilled, courses come out too slowly. It was very disappointing.

The Wynn was record breaking when it first opened and now the Encore is here with a smaller, but comfy feeling casino.

I usually stay at Cosmopolitan since I like the party atmosphere, but this past weekend the rates were extremely high since the NAB conference was in town. So I decided to stay at Encore instead. After checking-in, I took the elevator to my panoramic view king resort suite. The room was in great condition, spacious, with an amazing view of the strip. Nothing was worn down. 

So between the Wynn\/Encore resort, there really isn't anything cheap here. So if you are traveling on a budget, this resort probably isn't for you. Or make frequent runs across the strip to the Fashion Show Mall to eat and shop. I ate at Jardin for breakfast and dinner, and at Tableau for breakfast while there. Food and service was excellent.

Being a fitness junkie, I thoroughly enjoyed the fitness center. It had everything I needed. They also provide water (room temperature and chilled), and towels (dry and wet), plus fruit (apples, bananas). 

The smoke in the casino was not too bad either. I hate going to MGM sometimes and walking through the casino because I end up wheezing and coughing with all the smoke build up.

Overall, I had a very enjoyable stay here. I will probably stay here over Cosmo again next time I'm in town.",0,0,1

The Encore has more vegan options, (no I don't mean salads with fancy names...) They have pastas, burgers, milkshakes, chicken dishes, and everything you can possibly think of.  You can eat vegan, and not even know it!

My room\/suite was so amazing that I'm rating Encore 5 stars right off the bat. My room was beautifully decorated, spacious, and luxurious. This is definitely how I want to vacay every time! I've been to the Wynn several times but never really walked around Encore. The second that I walked in through those Encore doors I fell in love with the red decorations. I'm a photographer so the first thing that came to mind was 'photoshoot!!'. The hallways, the check-in counter, the lounge right by the elevators to the room were all aesthetically pleasing to my eye. I could've just strolled through all the pieces of art around the hotel if it wasn't congested with smoke.

As soon as I walked into my room, I felt like I was living a dream. I suppose that is the theme of the Encore and the Wynn... to feel like we're living a dream. Our view of the strip was amazing mostly because our window to the outside was the entire wall. From my room I could see the Wynn hotel and the Encore Beach Club downstairs.

For light sleepers, Encore rooms might be a problem because I could hear some of the music from the club downstairs the first night I stayed there. Tues night and Wed night must be break night for Vegas in terms of clubs cuz I didn't hear music playing at night on those nights.

As for gambling, there isn't a large selection of slot but there's enough variety. I didn't play at any of tables at Encore but there seems to be a decent enough selection. If you need more to choose from, the walkway to the Wynn is pretty short. I'd say it's about a 5 min walk passing through some lovely shops.

I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat at Encore. I only saw a lounge and a bar, which didn't attract me much for food.

We got a special promotion for this room and I have to say that (especially for the price I paid) it was amazing. The room was enormous, so comfortably appointed, really beautifully decorated, the bathroom was bigger than our bedroom at home...we had a view of ""downtown"" (seemed to be a view of the Rio and a Ross store), which was nothing to write home about, but that's because we checked in super-early; if we had been willing to wait longer we might have had a Strip view, but we had only slept 3 hours and were eager to rest and take a shower, etc. At least our room was very quiet; never heard any noise at night.

Service was so kind and courteous from my very first interaction. Whenever I called (to inquire about changing my reservation, etc.) the people I spoke to were super nice and helpful. Ditto when I got there; ditto when I called the front desk to ask a question; ditto when I stopped by the concierge and the bell desk for one thing or another. 

The whole property is absolutely gorgeous...gorgeous rooms, gorgeous lobby, gorgeous gardens, gorgeous pools, gorgeous restaurants and bars; even the casino looked much cleaner and ""classier"" than most of the others we walked through. 

My husband and I aren't gamblers, and this was our first trip to Vegas; it was just sort of that, ""well, you've got to try it at least once in your life"" types of trips, and in large part because I had gotten this amazing promotion. Honestly, the best part of the whole trip was the hotel, especially the bedroom...we also spent quite a bit of time at the pool (the sunset pool at the Wynn was our favorite) and that was great, but a little too crowded in the afternoon and the drinks were waayyy too expensive.

In fact, I'd say the only real drawbacks to the place (and I am sure it's the same problem anywhere in Vegas) was that everything--but EVERYTHING--was expensive. I needed sunscreen and tried to buy it at a store inside the resort--$32! Come on. We ended up walking about a mile to the nearest Walgreen's to find it at a somewhat normal price. It doesn't appear you can get a drink anywhere on the property for under $15, and even a small cappuccino runs $6 there!! A bit excessive. 

But I learned that's what Vegas costs...you can save on the hotel but they'll get you everywhere else...we probably won't be going back to Vegas anytime soon, but if we do, I'd definitely want to stay at Encore again--IF I get another good deal and can afford it!!",1,0,0

Front desk:
We arrived four hours before our check-in time, and a beautiful lady with long blond hair helped us out.  I think her name is Fitona (sorry if I got it wrong).  She gently asked for an upgrade, when we declined, she was still very willing to find a room facing the strip at 11am for us.  All on her own terms.  We didn't even have to ask.  

Taxi line:
The staffs here are always so pleasant, you'd forget that they've been standing in the cold for who knows how long.  Unfortunately, we got sick on our visit, and didn't have cash on hand to tip the guy who helped us on the morning of 1\/6, but he still carried our luggages and closed our door with grace and a smile.

CASINO: It's just like the Wynn, but with a slightly altered color scheme.

I have stayed at most of the resorts and stepped foot into all of them on the Strip.  And can now finally say that the Encore is my favorite.  And here is why:

1. No strollers allowed.  I have 2 kids and have even been ""that mom"" pushing a double stroller through a casino.  It is refreshing to not have to maneuver around kids. 
2. It is less crowded. 
3. It is a very classy hotel and casino.  Every time I have visited, I rarely see drunk obnoxious college kids. Perhaps this is because it is at the end of the strip and farther from all the action of the strip.  
4.  There is no smoking in many of the corridors and walkways. There seem to be a ton of security type personnel around reminding the patrons of this rule.  
5. Parking is so easy.  I actually hesitate to write the this review because I don't want it to get too crowded.  I love that the parking garage is an easy walk to the lobby.  No need to navigate through shops, etc. 
6. It is beautifully decorated.  I love the lights on the trees as you drive in.  The architecture is nice, and the design is very classy.  
7. The service is top notch.  Whenever I go, there is someone always ready to hold a door open for me, welcome me with a smile.  I feel like a VIP and I don't need a ""Noir Card"" to be treated like one.  
8. The room are clean, elegant and spacious.
9. I love that there is a huge window to the garden and pool.  It gives it a more open airy feeling, and you don't feel claustrophobic surrounded by 4 walls.  

Granted, it is one of the more pricier resorts on the Strip- but if you can treat yourself- it is so worth it! Also, I haven't stayed at this resort during pool season, which I have heard gets pretty loud.  So, if you are looking for a more peaceful visit, come in the winter.",5,3,7

+ Spacious rooms at great rates on select dates if you are a Wynn\/Encore insider

Why I can't give a fifth star:
- Cleanliness was an issue on our last stay.  We found part of a wrapper and red spots on the shower floor in our bathroom.  When we called in about this issue, a woman with housekeeping insisted the spotting was just part of the tile pattern and wiped it with her finger to prove her point.  (Ick!)  She proceeded to spray clean it anyway, but the stains did not go away.  We were still too grossed out to step on it, so we put towels on the floor when we took showers. 
- Maintenance issues.  Various light bulbs were out in our room on another stay.
- Safes don't display your code.  I like when safes quickly flash your code upon locking them, but theirs don't, so you better hope you correctly punched in the code you wanted!
- Very few options for cheap eats, and I don't care for the ones they do have.

The bank I was using switched from MasterCard to Visa, and I didn't think I would have a problem checking into the hotel because the entire stay was paid for. However I was proved wrong. The clerk said he was going to have to refund the money that I booked the room with (and could take 3-5 days to return to my account), and RECHARGE the full amount for the stay...which of course was a NICE chunk of change. So needless to say I was kinda miffed because this came out of our spending money for the 4 days of our stay.

There are mirrors all over your hotel room. In the hallways leading to your suite. By the elevators.  Some say it's a decorating trick used to make the space look bigger than it is, I say it's a narcissist's dream. 

From the moment you walk past the hotel's double glass doors, you'll be amazed by the inviting sight of Encore's glistening pool.  The vibrant red color is a dominating presence throughout the hotel, a deep shade of red that's sexy and sophisticated, not trashy. 

We booked a resort king suite for our recent stay here, but for something that's called a suite, I thought our room was on the small side.  Nevertheless, the bathrooms are spacious with a separate water closet and dual sinks with vanity area.   Overall the room is very trendy, tastefully decorated with touches of cream, black and light gold.  

Service is so good at the Encore.  Front desk people were professional and efficient.  The cocktail servers friendly.  The housekeeping staff do an incredible job, I walked around our hotel room barefoot and my feet didn't get dirty. 

The pool area is very chic with its manicured gardens, comfortable pool chairs, water stations randomly placed in corners.  There's also a separate European pool where you can go topless. 

If a great deal comes up like the one we snagged, I would gladly stay here again. It's a pleasant change to the usually crowded middle of the strip hotels.  (i.e.Caesars, Bellagio)

Plus, I REALLY love those mirrors!",28,27,24

We haven't stayed here in years but this is where our family selected for a short vacation. To begin with, the valet and bellmen were on it as soon as we pulled up. They offered to charge our car and were fast, polite and we're quick to be helpful in general. Jewel at the registration counter lived up to her name. The organization is lucky to have her. I had 3 reservations I was checking in and she was efficient, friendly and engaged in small talk that didn't seem 'canned.' As in other reviews, the hotel is luxurious, the rooms have panoramic views, great amenities and beautiful furnishings. That being said, we were with our family at the main pool (I believe there are 3 pools) and the first thing we noticed was how dirty the daybeds were that were for rent. Not just 'over time' dirt, but what looked like strawberries smeared on one of them. Not only would I not sit on one, the idea of paying for it was ludicrous! The water is absolutely the perfect temperature and there are lots of shallow areas to sit and just relax. I'm guessing Steve Wynn doesn't know who his hotel hires for pool repairs. Looked like a bad craft project. If his hotels are all about perfection and attention to detail, then someone had their eyes closed when they worked on the pool grout and cleaned the seating. Pool menu was a bit lacking and when your order comes out, it looks like vending machine plating. The sandwiches are wrapped just like when you see them in machines. Food was all good, but expect to wait. Our pool servers were attentive and helpful. Everything at this hotel from the coffee to any restaurant is higher than what you'll pay at other hotels. The staff at the coffee bar are friendly and fast! A medium (their large) latte will be $6.50 and a muffin is $5.00. Don't forget the tip! Parking is extra and the Resort Fee is high. Their wifi was slow and phone service for our location (36th floor facing South) wasn't very good. You had to walk to certain parts of the room to not cut out. We ate at 3 of their restaurants, as well as the pool food. If you get their special offers the price is easier to digest. For me...I won't rush back, but not saying never again.",0,0,0

We arrived on a Sunday and after flashing my '$20 trick,' I politely requested to be moved from the 39th floor to the 54th strip view floor. I don't really know if it was the tip that worked or just being persistent and friendly. I do believe that any of the higher floors are considered an upgrade as I overheard a conversation between another couple and the desk clerk discussing a ""$25 nightly charge"" to be on a higher floor. In any case, the hotel room was absolutely FABULOUS with GORGEOUS views.
The Encore casino itself was extremely clean, the cleanest on the strip. I constantly saw housekeeping staff going around and wiping down all of the machines. I'm attaching some photos, so you can view for yourself.
Everyone in the hotel was both friendly and personable, willing to help when needed instead of some places where they pretend not to see\/hear you :P. Of all the hotels\/casinos we visited, only at Encore and Sam's Town did someone open the doors for you (surprising since we also visited the Bellagio, Venetian, etc). BTW, if interested, I will be writing a full review of Sam's Town tomorrow complete with pictures, which I find to be a family friendly off-strip resort complete with a separate non-smoking casino. Which reminds me, Encore was the least smoky of all the casinos that we visited, I rarely saw anyone smoking there (yay).
If you check my screenname in a couple days, you can find reviews of the various restaurants at Encore, but I highly recommend visiting Wynn's Champagne Sunday Brunch, or the Buffet at any time. It was the highest quality and freshest food of any Buffet that I have ever visited. We occasionally go to some rather extravagent restaurants, and I would compare the food at the Wynn Buffet to some of those restaurants. I don't like to diss, but I would skip the Bellagio Buffet. More than just a few dishes we tried there seemed to be spoiled, the desserts were unimaginative and plain, comparative to any $8 buffet that you can find in your own hometown. BTW, their prime rib was tough and was not tasty.
Also notable mention includes Tableau for breakfast, and Daniel Boulud (had the best seafood\/shellfish that I have ever had the honor to taste, and I grew up on the beach where fishermen brought in their catches directly to the market). Society cafe was nice for a lunch, nice atmosphere with a view of the casino.
Just to note, we found a deal on slickdeals.net for our room, it was $109\/night and gave us a $50 resort credit and $25 slot play. Oh, can't forget to say that I found Encore to have loosest slots, even over Wynn. I know some other people might try to argue this, but maybe they are better because Encore is new and less crowded and wanting to attract people? We gambled there every morning for about 4-5 hours. The first day we used our $25 slot credit and my $10 slot credit to play for about 5 hours and didn't spend another dime. Other days had similar experiences, I think the most we spent per person was $30-$40 and got all the free coffees\/specialty drinks we wanted. We played ""Wizard of Oz"" and some ""Star Trek"" game that my husband loved, (he is sorta a star trek geek ;) . Those two seemed to pay out more and have more bonus games than any of the others we played in the casino.

Well, closing for now, enjoy the pictures! (btw, internet service there is an extra $15\/day)
P.S. People dress to come here, dressy\/casual and dress shorts, all the way to stiletto heels and tuxedos. People did not wear jeans or scruffy t shirts. Everyone is clean. It isn't an ostentatious place, there were all walks of people there, it is just that everyone wore the best they had and took a shower before arriving :P I am a nurse and my hubby is a software engineer, we felt very comfortable (meaning that we aren't wealthy and didn't feel out of place there).",1,1,1

I love Encore. I really do. It has the best looking rooms with the best views of the strip. XS is by far the best nightclub in Vegas and it's fitting that it's part of the Encore resort. Your slot machines in your casino are awesome. If it wasn't for one of your Wheel of Fortune slot machines, I would've been down $20. But I broke even on my last spin! Your staff is amazing and polite. I checked in early at around 11:30am and I was told that my room was already ready! Your pool areas are the perfect places to relax and soak up the sun. And your pool waitresses...yummy. Just, yummy.

With all that said, I must apologize to you. I have to apologize on behalf of myself and my friends. On the night of July 3rd (more like early morning of July 4th), we might have made a little bit too much noise in the hallway outside of our room. You see, it was 3 in the morning and one of my friends had brought a girl (more like a crazy ass bitch) he met at Surrender back to our room. The rest of us knew what they were up to in the room and we decided to barge inside, but he had put the door lock hinge thing in place. Thankfully, they were done with their dirty deed and were looking for their shoes. We were all extremely tired and wanted him and the aforementioned crazy ass bitch to leave the room, so we repeatedly yelled at them to hurry up. I'm thankful that no one in the other nearby rooms came out and yelled at us for being so noisy and causing such a ruckus.

I would also like to apologize for the numerous amounts of ""hair"" that was left on one of your beds (and subsequently shaken off onto the carpet). Apparently, that bitch sheds like crazy and doesn't believe in waxing or shaving or trimming. She was your typical jungle monkey. Ugh, it sickens me just to think about it. We left a note for our housekeeper to change the sheets the next day. I hope that she did. And I hope she vacuumed the carpet too. I have full faith in your housekeeping staff that room 5426 is spotlessly clean now.

Upon check in they ask you if you want a mountain view room or a strip view room. They also warn you that the strip side will be noisier. 

The room service is prompt and they basically set up a mini restaurant inside your room so that you can eat comfortably. Rooms are cleaned in a ninja fashion, meaning they do not bother you while you have your ""privacy"" light on, but once you switch it to ""make up room"" your room will be spotless by the time you get back from whatever adventure you're having.

The bathrooms are huge and they include a spacious tub and shower to help you re-coop from your crazy adventures the night before. The ability to open and close the drapes from your bed is a godsend during those extra sunny mornings after your long nights.

The casino isn't as lively but that's what I enjoy about this resort. It's an amazing escape from the party craziness. I can always count on getting enough beauty sleep on their amazing king size ma tresses. Having a hotel room so close to the hottest clubs, Surrender, XS, Tryst etc is just a bonus. You can also buy tickets at a discounted rate for each of these spots, exclusive to hotel guests. 

The pools are always clean and you have tons of choices, if the Beach Club isn't your thing, you can lay out at one of the many other pools, including one Euro style topless pool.

Wazuzu is my favorite restaurant on the resort, amazing Asian food at relatively decent prices. I did get to try the Sunday Brunch at the Wynn buffet this past trip and I was blown away by all the choices and the amazing selection of desserts! You can even buy a $15 VIP pass that lets you cut the buffet line and comes with a complimentary alcoholic beverage.

So what's the problem? Mr Wynn, I want at least one place where I can get an affordable meal at your hotel. I'm staying four nights and I need variety, something more casual. Especially when I'm hungry at night. You close Zoozacrackers at 10:30, what am I supposed to do when I'm in your casino and hungry at 11? The only late night place across two hotels is the coffee shop and Stratta? And while I'm on that topic, the food there sucked. The sauce tasted like chef boy-ar-dee was in the kitchen.

And while I'm on a rant...what's with the nickel & diming on everything? not very classy. $13.99 for internet. $15 to use the fitness center or $55 for the spa access if I want to take a shower or steam afterwards. And why can't I use the Wynn spa amenities as an Encore guest? Don't you own both? No late checkout, not even for a fee. Want to stay an extra night? That'll be at $495 rack rate. Want a comp for all the hours played  here? Sorry, your special Red Card rate invalidated any future comps. What? So you got me in here and now you're saying you won't reward me for playing here?

The bed, bedding, and pillows are the best on the strip, no questions asked.  It's such a nice feeling coming back to such a comfortable bed, my wife agreed, she said we probably can't stay anywhere else on our next visit just based on the how great of sleep she was able to get.  

The bathroom was amazing, bench in the shower with very high water pressure.  Be sure and pick up some bath bombs or bubble bars from Lush, and thank me later.   Always nice to enjoy a good hot bath before bed.

The casino floor is quite small at the Encore  compared to all the other big casinos on the strip, but it is connected to the Wynn which has an insanely huge casino floor.

Only gripe was the insanely expensive room service, $44 for chicken fingers and french fries hahaha lol.  $19 for chicken fingers, $9 french fries, $8 delivery fee, 18% gratuity, to give them benefit of the doubt, it was enough food to feed (2) people.",6,2,2

Gorgeous and spacious rooms and our room view was amazing from the 15th floor. The only reason I knocked a star off was the simple fact that the ice machines were all empty on our floor AND the floor below.  When our bags finally arrived, our bellhop asked if we needed anything else. Ummmmm.....ICE!? Lol She said a lot of people who stay at the resort bring their ice chests to keep drinks cold to avoid paying for the use of a refrigerator. (Yes, no free use of a fridge in a resort like this!) Lastly....wifi is TERRIBLE there! Once you get into your room, expect dropped calls or no service. Very spotty. Check in was uber friendly and check out was just as courteous. Only suggestion is to add more ice machines per floor and a better wifi but great hotel otherwise!",0,0,0

I stayed at my usual favorite spot, the Encore (in the Encore tower suites) so this review might be a little bias. This place is beautiful, clean & great for a nice weekend get away or a long stay. I love this hotel because it reminds me of Europe, has so many yummy places to eat & awesome craps tables. If you love to relax you can lounge by the 2 amazing pools (one family style and one European 21+ pool) or hit the Spa for a relaxing massage & facial. If you like to party there is the encore beach club (a day pool party) XS, & Surrender ( nightclubs, both so much fun). There are also numerous bars and lounges for pre drink or chilling. I used to stay at the Wynn but the encore is MUCH chiller, less crowds of families and children & more adult friendly. Awesome views from your room & excellent amenities!

The property is absolutely gorgeous, no detail overlooked-even the elevators are beautiful! The ""$20 sandwich"" trick doesn't work here, so don't even try it. We threw out ""we're on our honeymoon,"" hoping to get a complimentary room upgrade, but that didn't work either. Luckily, they did give us a relatively high floor (the 33rd), and a great view of the strip. The only downside, as others mentioned, is that the pool club is rather noisy, but it was only open for one night of our stay and didn't interfere with our sleep.

All I can say about the room is ""Wow."" By far the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in, or will ever stay in. No need to pay extra for the upgraded room. Luxurious robes (be sure to call down to the front desk for the free slippers you can keep), very comfy bed. The man who delivered our bags gave us a walkthrough of the room, how things worked, how to avoid extra charges, etc. Very nice.

We were far from the wealthiest or most important guests at this hotel, yet the service was fantastic. I have a sneaking suspicion that the champagne and strawberries sent up to our room was from the Encore, although they refused to take credit. When I tried to tip the girl who delivered it, at first she refused, saying that the gratuity was included. The staff is very gracious. We also received mini cupcakes with ""Congratulations"" written in chocolate syrup at dinner at Lakeside.

Just know that this is a classy place--no shorts at dinner, and I felt pretty crummy showing up in jean shorts and sandals after getting off the plane. Definitely step it up a notch with your dress--no rolling out of bed to grab a cup of coffee downstairs. Lots of glamorous people with money to burn, but no one treated us like we didn't belong.

Pool area is gorgeous. Encore guests can use Wynn pools, but not vice versa. We used the European pool, which was a lot bigger. Hardly any ladies going topless so not a big deal. Also, no kids allowed at the European pool.

Oh, and do not venture north of the Encore--sketchy!

This has to be the best hotel on the Strip. I am spoiled forever.

1.  Don't stay at Encore or Wynn, unless you are lucky enough to have received a promo from them...in that case, it's a pretty good deal.
2.  Walgreen's, the ABC store, and Strip Liquor are your friends...find out where they are and use them instead of paying insanely high prices for booze and snacks inside the casino.
3.  If you are a coffee\/tea drinker, invest in a hotpot (if you don't feel like packing one from home you can find one for $12 at the aforementioned Walgreen's) instead of paying the, again, insanely high prices in the casino.  You can also use said hotpot for oatmeal, cup o' noodles, hot toddies, etc.
4.  Your other friends are the Monorail and your feet...stay away from cabs.  Everything you need (i.e. liquor store, Walgreen's, other cool casinos and restaurants) is within walking distance anyway.
5.  Encore will put a $150 per night hold on your credit card...if you're staying 4 nights that's $600 for the non-math-inclined.  This makes it tempting to make all sorts of room charges, but unless you are extremely organized and self-disciplined, these room charges are ill-advised.  It's just too easy to lose track of how much money you're spending, and it doesn't seem much like ""real money"" if you're not taking something out of your wallet.
6.  Take advantage of the ""free"" stuff that is really cool...the pool area, the fitness center, the slot credit if you're lucky enough to get it, etc.
7.  Eat as many meals as possible elsewhere.  While the food here is decent, it is ultra spendy and the service we got was horrible.
8.  Don't gamble unless it's with house money.

The room my girlfriend and I received was impeccable and odor free.  The suite's beautiful decor was modern and luxurious, complete with a clean assortment of black and white furniture pieces situated on beige-white marble tiles and carpet with black and brass color trimmings.  The wall opposite to the door was a dramatic large window overlooking the strip.

Its casino floor is a seamless extension of Wynn's red-and-white motif.  But, unlike Wynn, Encore hardly gets packed.  Because of this, the number of tables and games are very limited.  For instance, there is generally only one roulette table operating at any given time.

Service-wise, the staff and crew were generally courteous.  Our concierge was incredible, while the check-in and cleaning staff were friendly.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for their comp staff -- they were rude and extremely impatient when we attempted to redeem our rewards points.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my stay at Encore and would definitely go back. 

SIDE NOTE: one of the stores in Encore's forum was unfriendly, specifically the Rolex shop.  I had wanted to buy my girlfriend a pink oyster watch as a surprise, but an elder lady who worked at the shop didn't want to help my girlfriend for some odd reason -- maybe because we were young or we dressed vacation casual.  Regardless, the Rolex employee was classless and intellectually bankrupt.  I ended up going to the Rolex store a couple of blocks away.",17,0,8

You get your room card and it's imprinted with your name, your phone is personalized, and so is the TV menu.  The lights and curtains are all remotely controlled.

My wife and I stayed here for the first time a couple years ago but on our last visit we moved down the strip to the new, supposedly hottest most cosmopolitan hotel in town. I'm happy to be back at Encore.  Encore has a great brand, and it is luxurious, bright and welcoming.  The location rocks too - proximity to the airport and Las Vegas Convention Center are also excellent. 

The room is my favorite in town. It is really well designed and furnished, and every detail has been considered - even the thermostat is black against the black wall. Who thinks about buying a thermostat any color other than white?  The controls for the lights and the drapes are on the night table and the bed is really comfortable. My tv swiveled around to the living room area pushed only by my pinky finger. The shower is also a highlight - beautiful with perfect water pressure. 

I also really like the size of the casino. I find even the adjacent Wynn to be too big, crowded and imposing. The scale of Encore is more intimate, and everything is more conveniently located closer together.  Sure, the food options in particular are limited, yet the additional restaurants, shopping and entertainment options afforded by the Wynn are a short and beautiful indoor walk away.

Not that there weren't strollers anyway, but way way less than a ""normal"" casino. Oh, and we found a 21 and over only lounge at the Wynn. Got to enjoy amazing cocktails in a gorgeous setting with a short show every 30 min. (Parasol Down) with nary a child in sight. Wooohooo!!

The only suggestion I have for Mr. Wynn is for a hotel-guests priority line for the Wynn buffet. We really really wanted to try the holiday dinner menu but alas, the average wait was 3+ hours, and that was at 2:30 in the afternoon! We did get to the holiday brunch menu on the 26th (got there early, about 10AM) and it was great.  And again, the attention to detail showed: they use Wedgewood flatware at the buffet. 

That kind of attention to detail applies to every aspect of the Wynn properties. For instance, the dresser drawers close automatically and silently.  The closet is quite large and has another dresser in it, which was really convenient.

The casino was big and classy, and the property had several restaurants and convenience stores.  The parking was also easy to maneuver. 

I suggest you add the resort package at $25\/night which includes a gym pass, internet, and free calls within the US.  I used all aspects, so this was a smart spend.

For the price the quality was not there.  

The food was bad.  For the price it was shameful.  If I'm going to get a $20 plate of eggs, they should not be a. cold, b. not what I ordered, and c. the hashbrowns shouldn't be a dried up casserole cube of apparently frozen product.  The vegetarian options (I'm lacto-ovo veg...a reason I chose the hotel) mainly contained Gardein processed, packaged fake meat instead of carefully prepared fresh, whole foods.  This, IMO, is like serving Oscar Meyer slices on the meat-eaters' fine dining menus.  I was stunned that it was impossible to find a decent pastry in the morning.  What they were selling looked like the oversized, dry muffins and croissant that you'd get at a Starbucks at an airport in the midwest.  They looked so nasty we left without ordering.  I can't think of another top end casino that doesn't have a fancy patisserie.   Room service was OK:  nice servers, boring menu with mediocre food, a little slower than promised.  We requested a glass of half-and-half for coffee in the a.m. with our dinner order.  When it didn't come with our order, they told me that they don't carry it.  Seriously?

There was a surcharge for everything, and I found this sort of insulting.  You pay a $25 resort fee, and the only amenity that seemed to come with this extra fee was access to the gym.   The card that described the benefits of the resort fee, also listed internet access...for another fee of $14.  Clearly they have a different idea of what ""included"" means than I do.  For breakfast at the cafe, there were a dozen or so meals listed under the big heading $18, but after fully half, there was fine print telling you how much to add if you ordered that selection (And I'm not talking about adding the shrimp or whatever.  It was a scam to make you have to do the arithmetic to get a price.)  We went for a drink at the Parasol bar.  Lagavulin scotch was $18.  I was surprised since that's only a little more than it is most places.  But the fine print was that any of the spirits ordered as a shot, neat, or on the rocks would be subject to a $3.50 surcharge....which left us wondering, how else does anyone order aged scotch?  

The bed was so comfortable.  I think this was the highlight of the trip for me.  I thought the rooms were not attractive.  It felt like I was in a leasing office for a condo development.  The view from our room was of construction, Circus-Circus, and a seedy little end-of-the-Strip strip mall.  

I may sound like I'm just being cheap, but we went prepared to spend a lot of money to have a high quality experience.  I'm annoyed because I feel like we spent a lot of money for an experience that would have been surpassed for half the price at the M.  Likewise, we've spent similar money on the room and far less on dining and fees to have a much, much, much higher quality experience at Caesar's.  In the future, I'll return to these places andI won't be back to the Wynn\/Encore.",0,0,0

This is the old location of the Desert Inn and is directly across the street from the Las Vegas Fashion Mall (connect via bridge).  I was an invited guest for their VIP opening before the actual grand opening.

This hotel whether people want to admit it or not is catered directly to the high roller Chinese whales.  The Casino is relatively small and the Baccarat and Pai Gow Poker Tables line the front of the floor.  The design is unique yet feels small.  Luxury is at a premium here and of course no expense has been spared.  The black and red carpets with Asian decor are a pretty good give-away at the target audience and the Crystal Dragon lining the Casino wall should re-enforce that idea.

The standard rooms are divided by a rotating LCD TV placing the bed on one side and the living space (step down) on the other with a desk and couch.  Again the decor is black\/white\/red so as to appeal to the lucky color red and the art is modern with some Asian influences.  The suites afford much more room as expected and give you the feel of a luxury apartment minus the kitchen.

The uniqueness is the placement of the pool.  This is influenced by the European\/Asian style of having huge urns and plants surrounding the water hole and giving you the impression of privacy.  It is located right out side directly across from the registration area.  Beautifully decorated and magnificent with a lot of light from the open air.  It reminds me of Steve Wynn's old property of the Golden Nugget's placement of their pool surrounded by the hotel and glass walls.

Again this is a 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond resort that really caters to the ultra rich and private.  There are private Bungalows just like the Wynn with private entrances and pools and are Asian Themed.  Some prefer the Encore, I actually prefer the Wynn but either way you should try one of these hotels at least once.",6,1,1

The hotel rooms are gorgeous: sophisticated and opulent without being too much (as can often be the case for Vegas).  The size of the suites are great and all those mirrors are perfect when you're traveling with a bunch of girls!

The location was great: I like being on that end of the strip, it was within walking distance to the Venetian, Fashion Show Mall and of course, the Wynn.  We didn't even need to leave all the time to get exactly what we wanted: Surrender, XS, Encore Beach Club, the Wynn buffet!  

I also always imagined having to walk a mile in Vegas hotels, but this hotel wasn't like that! The size was reasonable and I loved that it was more quiet and less hectic than say, The Venetian.

Service was top-notch as well.

My only complaint was that we requested two queens and we got one king bed.  But...I know sometimes these things happen on busy weekends. :\/

I would def. recommend Encore to someone looking for a little more sophistication and quiet, while being close to all the action. I would go back and stay there.",0,1,0

I stayed here from 8\/26-8\/28 in a Resort King Room and it was absolutely beautiful. Usually, I say the room doesn't really matter especially when in Vegas, because most the time is spent out and about partaking in drunken debauchery. 

However, (and the bf agreed) this past weekend we actually ended up spending a good amount of time in the room just because it was that awesome. From the auto drapes and lights (which makes everything soooo much easier) to the floor to ceiling windows, to the gorgeous bathroom, this room easily gets 5 stars! 

Note: We were staying in the most basic room at the Encore and asked for the highest level available. We were given the 36th floor. Initially, we paid the $20\/night upgrade for a ""panoramic view room."" We were moved to the 58th floor facing downtown (same as the the 36th floor). We went to our upgraded room and it was the same EXACT  view we had in our non upgraded room on the 36th floor. We went back to the check in desk and requested to be switched back to the basic room. They switched us back with no questions asked. Needless to say, the upgrade probably isn't worth it unless your going to be facing the strip. 


Now to review the other resort amenities: 
European pool at Encore is awesome, especially on Saturdays. It's an adult scene with a DJ and all. Only a few women (grandma types) had their tops off. The normal pool is nice as well if you're into the more laid back scene. We also ventured to the Wynn adult pool and normal pool. The normal pool here is nicer than Encores in my opinion. However, the adult pool at Wynn seemed kind of dirty and grimy to me (Encores is was much nicer). Drinks at both pools were over priced (as expected) so we just pre gamed in the room ;-) 

The casino at the Encore is nice, especially during the day; lots of open machines. 

Elevators to the rooms are very close to the parking structure (which is much appreciated in Vegas summer heat). 

We didn't use restaurants or clubs here so I can't comment on that aspect of Encore. 

Now my gripes (and the reason I docked a star): 
1. As many others have mentioned, the location kind of leaves something to be desired. Not because it's far from the Southern end of the strip, but because North of Encore it gets kind of dingy. We wanted to venture to Walgreen's but there were some sketchy characters (and that's by Vegas standards) in the area. 
2. After 11pm Encore becomes a zoo. Both XS and Surrender are in the hotels casino and an insane amount of people crowd the area. The line for XS wraps all the way through the Esplanade and the one for Surrender goes right smack dab through the center of the casino. 
3. 20\/night resort fee. mehh, it was kind of expected though. (it is nice that in room wi-fi is included in this, and they give you free water at the pool so I guess youre getting what you pay for)


Other than that, it was an awesome hotel experience with an accommodating and helpful staff! Will return!",1,1,0

Of all the glitz and glamour Sin City has to offer, it doesn't get better than the Encore. I've stayed at The Wynn as well, and though similar in design and decor, this one managed to take my breath away. Though I'll only sneak in a mere 2 hours of sleep each night, this is by far my favorite Vegas hotel to stay at. 

The rooms can only be described by one word: P-I-M-P! Live the lavish life of a true baller (even the ones on a budget). The queen suite is spacious enough to fit 6-8 for sleeping and about 14-17 for pre-partying. The L-shaped sofa in the living room makes it easy to fit an extra 2 guests comfortably. The bathroom is very spacious and the sinks make a great cooler for our champagne. Be advised: as amusing as they are, leave the automatic curtains closed, unless your hangover enjoys a good morning sunrise. There's a full stocked snack bar, but unless you're ready to pay and arm and a leg for a short stack of Pringles, don't take the items off the drawer! 60-second sensors are tricky tricky. 

The pool is a wonderful spot to chill at on a scorching summer day. Adequate amount of lay out chairs scattered amongst the premises, European style pool for the sexy 21+, black jack tables shaded off by the gazebo, and gorgeous people all around. Just leave me be with a bottle of tanning oil in one hand and a mojito in the other.

Not many restaurants available compared to the Wynn, but the more affordable dining venues are only a short trek away across the esplanade. If you plan to eat at Encore, don't expect to pay anything less than $30 for an entree. I've only dined at Sinatra, which was a wonderful meal, but unbelievably expensive for what they serve. 

Location is great. If you need to stock up on liquor and don't feel like choking up major bills at the casino bars, walk across the street to the run down plaza on the backside of the building and buy a full bottle of Grey Goose at Bev Mo prices. And who said Vegas doesn't have cheap alcohol? Also, don't forget to check out XS on a Friday or Saturday night. You're guaranteed to wake up looking\/feeling like a hot mess, but it'll be worth it.

The Staff were always friendly, courteous, and helpful. I used the valet, dined in the restaurants, used the sundries, the cafe, the fitness center, and of course the front desk. I did not have one interaction that was anything less then pleasant and satisfying. 

The Atmosphere of this hotel is spectacular. It is alive and vibrant without feeling crowded or noisy. Walking into other hotels on the strip was like leaving a quiet room and entering a chaotic mad house. Even on peak nights the inside of the encore was tranquil. Crossing over into the Esplanade you saw where everyone was at but within the confines of the Encore it was still civil. The red colors and butterflies were very modern and nice and both me and my wife really liked it. I can see where it may be too much red for some people but I I really enjoyed it.

The rooms are spacious, well lit, luxuriously appointed, and still modern. My only disappointment was when I saw the alarm clock was integrated in the curtain and light controls I assumed the alarm would trigger lights to come on and curtains to open. That didn't happen but that was the only negative I can find (hence the 5 stars).  We had a 54th floor panoramic with mountain views. The floor to ceiling windows and the comfy couch with chaise were perfect for enjoying it.

The beds are super comfortable I have a very expensive mattress at home and this is the first hotel we have stayed in that had a bed we liked more then our own. The linens are soft, warm, and clean. The pillows were outstanding  and I wanted to take them home with me. 

The TV selection was decent and having the music choice channels integrated was a nice touch. 

There is a resort fee of $20 a day that covers WiFi, fitness center, and some other stuff. I used the internet quite a bit as well as the fitness center. The fitness center is a great way to start your mornings and grab some free water as well. Headsets are provided there are numerous treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. There are your standard weight machines and free weights as well as places to stretch and do situps. They appeared to have some cardio rooms in the back as well.

Me and the Wife are not big gamblers but I did go up about $30 in the 5 mins I played the dollar slots. I cashed out and didn't play again the rest of the trip. The casio floor on the Encore is not as busy as the Wynn which makes it feel much more relaxing. The air is the least smokey of all the casino floors we walked in. 

The Restaurant selection is outstanding and there are some late night options but not many. More on that in my restaurant reviews coming up. 

So all in all a no hesitation easy 5 star rating for this majestic, elegant, masterpiece at the end of the strip.",4,1,2

The room and amenities cleanliness was not up to standards, white rings in the cups, Stain on the towels and sheets. Unbelievable for a 5 star place. 

The most ridiculous thing is that the hotel had no water during the night, I called front desk and inquired why. The only answer I got was it will be restore at 5am. So I have to go the whole night with no water, bathroom, shower, sink, nothing. I have stayed at 3rd world countries that does not have this problem.

I left my small bag with that perfume in the room and as soon as we left I realized I am missing it so I called them and after checking they said they did not found anything which was impossible. 

They asked me to send them an email when I return so they can follow up but unfortunately they did not even bother to reply to any of my emails. I wish they took matters like this that probably are very small to them more serious, because just that will make us never want to stay with them.",1,1,0

encore is, without a doubt, one of the smallest yet the most luxurious hotels on the strip. it obviously is designed to target high rollers and couples (no strollers allowed) who are looking for more relaxed ambiance than the typical vegas scene. 

overall, we enjoyed our 3 night stay despite some minor personal dislikes. 

* casino 
- the minute you enter the hotel, you are swept with ""fake"" flowery scents and brightly colored yet tastefully decorated casino floor 
- you can actually see outside with views of the pool and garden through huge windows 
- $0.01 slot machines and $10 tables with friendly dealers and pit boss 
- great boutiques (chanel, rolex, hermes, louis vuitton, ferrari, etc.). take advantage of lower sales tax (at least for southern californians) 
- $20 resort fee per night, per room for complimentary wi-fi and use of fitness center 

* room 
- large suite with great layout. half wall acting as a tv stand (which swivels) separates the bedroom from livingroom 
- contemporary and elegant with neutral color tones 
- one easy and convenient remote access system for lights and drapes 
- huge bathroom, but not enough functional space for more than 2 people (small tub, not enough electric outlets) 
- not the best towels. in fact, they had that industrial laundry smell 
- rooms with strip views get a lot of noise from clubs. mountain view rooms, on the other hand, are very quiet 
- comfortable bed with soft satin sheets 
- floor to ceiling mirrors on one entire wall...freakin' tacky! 

* fitness center (yes, i actually worked out) 
- the most gorgeous lobby with beautiful chandeliers and sitting area 
- free bottled water (don't touch that fiji water in your room) 
- state of the art equipment. all cardio machines with individual tv monitors with over 100 channels and headsets 

* parking 
- abundance of parking spots 
- unlike other hotels, the parking structure is really close to rooms 

the only gripe i have with encore is it's distant promixity to the main strip. but then again, this is what makes encore more exclusive and secluded. the hubby kept saying he did not want to leave the hotel, especially after getting lost at caesar's palace (vegas hotels never explicitly show ""exit"" signs). i would've had no problem obliging to this if money was not an object. well, who knows, maybe we could be the next big jackpot winners...woohoo!!!",8,4,5

Upon arrival, the bellman named Gary made a huge fuss about me trying to put a case of water onto the cart. There were multiple luggages, and I was only trying to speed up the process. Gary was hostile and unnecessarily rude stating ""don't hand it to me, if you drop it and you get hurt guess who gets the blame?"". Who knew this would just be the start.

At check in, the rooms were still left dirty and uncleaned. There were leftover chip crumbs on the carpet, finger smudges all over the nightstand, dirty glasses with lip stains left behind, and trash under the sofa. If you're paying $2000 for a weekend at a 5 star resort this should have been the least of our worries. This truly made us question the integrity of the entire room. After contacting housekeeping what was offered was a few chocolates, another turnover service, and house slippers. At this point, despite Gary and the dirty room, we were still happy to be back at the Encore and ready to enjoy our weekend.

On our first night out as we were returning to the rooms, 5 of us got STUCK in the elevator for over one hour. Not only did we have two claustrophobic women who were hyperventilating, in tears, and in full panic mode, the hotel staff was beyond rude. After pushing the ""help"" button and politely asking for assistance, the man answering back insisted In a rude and annoyed tone, stating someone would be coming. 10 minutes later after asking for updates and letting them know that two of the women were now panicking, the staff couldn't have care less. He offered no words of comfort, any sort of update other than ""someone is coming,"" or any sort of time frame and continued to blame us for ""jumping"". We're grown women FYI. After finally getting out, the paramedics on duty specifically told us that he didn't  understand why we were stuck for more than an hour, because they are just down the street-which leaves us questioning, what the hell took so long. The staff knew we had two women in full panic mode, and should have called the paramedics to pry open the doors as soon as we called for help. Security and the managers tried to blame us as if we had done something wrong. Then they rudely asked ""do you expect us to reimburse you?!"" What kind of hospitality does Encore give? Not one apology was given for a full 2 hours. Absolutely none. 

On our last night,  we had table service at XS nightclub and our bus boy was beyond rude. For example,  I asked for a glass of ice water from the water we had purchased and he specifically said ""NO"" and then continued to ignore me. As our bottles came to our tables he started to yell ""alcohols all gone, GO HOME!"" And the started to laugh. That statement of ""GO HOME"" would be heard multiple times.

The lack of care, quality, and service truly doesn't exist here anymore. If you're looking and paying for quality hospitality and service, look elsewhere. What happened Encore?",11,1,0

I also love the Encore Spa! It's way bigger than the Wynn and is a great pit stop before a night out. Although you have to pay for the facilities, which I don't really understand. I also used the large gym next to the spa and it was amazing! Very spacious and great water\/towel service.

The decor is beautiful. This truly is a five star resort.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. 

The room was amazing, from the lighting to the details of the room was perfect. We booked a panoramic king suite. It had floor to ceiling windows in the living room area  to give an amazing view in the morning and at night. 

The bathroom was huge and the travertine mosaics on the shower floor was exquisite. 

The gym is clean and really busy. One thing i didnt mind was that there were 5 treadmills out of order so as a runner I was a bit annoyed. The gym and wifi access was included in the resort fee so that was nice to use the amenities that you are actually paying for during the stay.

My husband and I stayed here for our wedding weekend in Vegas, and the experience was just incredible.  The front desk knew we were getting married, and sent up complimentary strawberries and champagne.  The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and have great views.  Ours had a strip view (which, obviously, is great), but the people watching at the Beach Club, at night at XS, and at the pools during the day were added bonuses.  

And for the ladies-- the bathrooms in the suites have a small vanity space (a comfy bench with a great, lit cosmetic mirror on the counter).  I hate doing my makeup standing up, and getting ready for my wedding was a great, stress-free experience thanks to this smart addition.  

The gym, pool, and other amenities are great.  LOVED the gym.  The staff bring you chilled water bottles and towels while you're on the treadmils, and will bring you more water if they see that your current bottle is running low.  Ummm, who doesn't love that?",0,0,0

I got a massage at the spa which was very relaxing, hung out by the pool, went to the Beach Club and to Surrender Night club.

Some good things to know before you check in: they will want to authorize $150 per day you stay on your credit card for incidentals (its Vegas - no matter where you are they want to charge you for everything). XS, Surrender and various other bars and amazing restaurants are available to you within quick walking distance. I enjoyed the Society Cafe for breakfast and Switch restaurant for dinner. The pools are lovely and you have a quite a few options to chose from! The Fashion Show Mall is right across the street if Louis V, Channel, Hermes and Manolo are not on your agenda.

Although I didn't stay in Encore's hotel suite during this trip I did get to visit one their suites because one our associates booked a room there, and I've stayed in one of their suites several years ago. 

Seeing their suite this time around was exactly how I remembered it several years ago. The suite, while it was small, was well designed to give the appearance and feeling of spaciousness and comfortability. 

The conference room was huge. The set up and design was aesthetically pleasing. The room was well ventilated. The air conditioning was turned up during the entire convention that it kept the room nice and cool especially since the temperature outside was over a hundred degrees and so many bodies in one room would have easily made the room unbearable. They also provided us with ice water during the entire convention. They replenished the water coolers periodically to make sure we didn't run out of water. There were other conferences held next door and the sound containment did not seem to be an issue. 

As for the rest of the hotel, with its sounds and lights emanating from the many slot machines on the floor, it was a pleasant sight to behold. There wasn't anything about the hotel that made it seem old or dilapidated. It made me feel excited to be here.

It was the second year in a row we visited for our anniversary (29th & 30th).  

We upgraded to a 59th floor strip view and it was gorgeous.  I know others are more picky in their reviews but I honestly have a hard time finding any fault with Encore other than Steve Wynn himself (his voice and face seems everywhere).

The rooms are big and I love the layout.  The beds very comfy, the toiletries were fine.  The housekeepers were great, not only did they clean every inch they were friendly and respectful in a person to person way.  The only fault I found in the room was that the Golden Nugget Rush Tower  rooms  towels were nicer.  

We enjoyed the gym a time or two and a couple of restaurants (Society and Le Cave).  The casino was smallish, which I find attractive and the waitresses were quick and friendly.  We were at the Sports book a lot and enjoyed the setting as well.

Service wise, everyone we met was outstanding.  Checkin was a breeze.  As was check out.  The only issue we had was this year at the pool the ""chair savers"" were rampant and the pool staff dawdled on removing towels from said chairs.  Also, the waitstaff, while superb were not quite as good as last year.  It could just be circumstance but last year they actually remembered our name day to day when  this year they did not even remember during the course of one day. You know I'm nitpicking when this is used as a complaint, right?

All in all I'd say your standard of expectations would have to be mighty high to not love everything about Encore.  If we can afford it next year we'll be back. Last year they sent a cheese and fruit plate to our room for our anny, this year not but they certainly can't be expected to.

The rooms were comfortable and very spacious. The bed was amazing. It was like laying on a bed of clouds! The bathroom had enough room for multiple people to get ready with enough mirror space for everyone. The Desert Bambu bath products are some of the best! I am tempted to call the Wynn and see if I can buy full size bottles of the stuff! It was also nice having the sitting area. 
We didn't leave the property very often but that was not a bad thing! The pool was fabulous. Servers came around pretty frequently. The staff also came around quickly to clean or the lounge chairs when people left. The area was clean and it seemed like someone was always around to help if you needed it.
We were on the 37th floor and there was little outside noise that could be heard. We couldn't even hear the rooms next to us if they had their TV on. What a nice change!
The only hiccup was that we were there for a wedding and it was requested that all the guests be in the same area. This delayed getting our room a little bit because it was not cleaned when we checked into the hotel. This is no fault of the hotel. I actually thoguht it was great that they grouped us together...and even upgraded a few of us. 
Overall we had a wonderful experience. The service was top notch. For example, do you know any other hotel that will check into your flight for you and print the boarding pass at no charge? They do that at the Encore! Yes, it does cost a little more money overall, but it is money well spent! We did end up visiting a few other hotels\/casinos during our stay and that just solidified that we would be back to the Encore. It is just a different standard of service.

Turned out to be ~$116\/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le Rêve.  Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book!

Dang SWEET right?!
I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?!
They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?!

Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino.  I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long.  I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck.  So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time.  I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back.  Drank a lot of ""free"" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's.  But no matter how you look at it, Encore\/Wynn got their money's worth outta me.   Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed.  (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) 

The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV.  Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV.  Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels.  When staying at the Encore\/Wynn, you also have access to their ""European"" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired.  So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were ""propped up"" and indeed topless.  More power to them.  Cabañas can be rented on a per\/day basis.   

I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the ""free"" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET.  Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there.  The one great thing was the wait service.  The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative.  As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about.  I think I did eat about 10 crème brulees as that was all that was memorable.

Le Rêve was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end.  At least that's my take on it.  But a great production none the less.",25,26,26

From the first contact with employees to the last is always pleasant and engaging. My partner and myself visit Vegas frequently, we will not stay anywhere other than encore. The rooms are very transitional aesthetically and exceptionally well appointed. My favorite part aside from the rooms and service is the pool\/spa. Even if you do not enjoy the spa, you must visit just to see stunning design, details, and service. The pool, i always opt for the European pool, not for the sights, but for the no children atmosphere. The pool cocktail servers are constantly anticipating your needs, which seems to be a recurring thing at this resort. The best days for the pool, while might be crowded are Saturday and Sunday, as a dj is playing some sort of edm music. I am a lover of all things room service, and encore room service really delivers on the room service. Some of the best dinners I have had in Vegas were encore room service. Also, if you need a night of recovery, order a movie and room service. Room service has a movie night package, which consists of candy, popcorn, and sodas.

Everything about this hotel is amazing. I've chosen Encore as my go-to hotel ever since Wynn upgraded us to a Encore room many years ago... Upon entrance, you'll notice the beautiful black\/red floral color scheme the luxurious vibe from the atmosphere of the hotel. This past visit, we stayed in the Tower Suites overlooking the Strip. Everything about the stay was perfect and we had a wonderful time. Large rooms, spacious living room area and bedrooms with a TV that rotated to face either the bedroom or the living room, huge bathroom area with glass showers and big bathtub, and a huge glass window wall overlooking the Strip.
 
Service was great and they were very accommodating. We asked for extra sheets and they were brought up in less than 10 minutes. The Tower Suites had a separate private door\/lobby and there was always someone there to open the door for us. Casino is medium sized and the slots were relatively new. There is valet parking and self-park. Very close to the famous Tacos El Gordo restaurant and their sister hotel, Wynn. Thanks for the amazing stay, Encore!",2,0,1

Beautiful, the room itself felt a bit old and even a little boring but the bed was super comfy and the bathroom was nice so that made up for it. There are a lot of very nice amenities and this place is definitely not for people that are on a budget. But for a nice get away away from the crowdy part of the strip this is for you. My only gripe would be that because it's so luxe here it seems a bit quiet, the casino isn't packed and the stakes are all high at the tables. Great place to vacation, but if you want to be part of the crowds and hop from casino to casino, this isn't the place.",1,0,0

(I have reviews on these hotels on Yelp.)  Hands down, this was by far this won my vote for best accommodations!!  Talk about amenities, customer service and more!  I have uploaded a detailed photo of the rooms that you should check out.  Here is a list of all of the great things that the hotel has to offer to you as a guest.

LAYOUT: Each room is a suite.  The living area faces the window and has a really great floor plan.

DÉCOR: Super modern and comfortable.  If you are a fan of Z Gallerie, you will love the décor.

HOTEL PLUS: 
- Double sinks, shower and bath, TV in the bathroom, lots of drawer space, fax machine in the room, curtain and room light controls on the nightstand, awesome big flat screen TV with almost 70 channels that can rotate to face your bed or your living area, robes, and... if you call to request for a wake-up call they will ask you for two times so that they can make sure that you don't snooze on the first call.  They also will provide you with customized access keys which bear your name on them--that way you know that it's your card and not your roomies' card.  They also customized your phone so that you names appears on the phones, sort of like if you are at work!  On top of it all, they have one of the most comfortable down feather beds that you will ever sleep on.

(POSSIBLE) HOTEL MINUSES:
- If you are a super, super light sleeper, then you may want to reconsider staying at this hotel or even the Wynn Hotel.  I was on the 16th floor and could see the pool from afar.  The big pool also doubles as a nightclub at night Thurs. - Sat.  You could faintly hear the bass and music from down below.
- The check-in area is a bit unorganized.  I think that it could use a few stanchions to avoid the free for all feel.  Once you check-in, they basically tell you that you need to come back when your room is ready (if you arrive early) and that you will need to stand in another line to pick-up your card key.  A bell hop is readily available to bring your luggage up to your room once you arrive.  ETA took about 15-20 minutes for us to receive our luggage.  So be prepared to roll out onto The Strip with whatever you are wearing.

TIP #1: Request for a room with an even number.  It will face south which also faces the strip.  No extra charge.

TIP #2: When you check in, request (nicely) for free admission passes to their clubs XS and Tryst.  No extra charge.  These passed will get you in for free between 10AM - Midnight.

TIP #3: They are offering a great promotion.  Although I booked my stay through Southwest Vacations, I managed to qualify for their $75 room credit.  SCORE!!!",1,0,0

The resort king suite was clean, modern, comfortable, with a well stocked mini bar, HUGE bathroom, and a tablet to control your lights, drapes, etc. 

Restaurants and shopping here are plentiful. I really liked the Terrace Cafe for breakfast brunch and the famously awarded Buffet for lunch or dinner. The dessert section there is officially my ""happy place"". 

Pools here were meh- the European pool had slow service, no room to walk between all the chairs, and on the day we went I'm positive the pool water would NOT pass inspection. The water smelled awful, and it looked like an oil slick. 

I did notice that the attendants do check the chairs that are ""saved"", and WILL remove your towel that you try to put down all freaking day but are not present. I'm bringing my review up to 5 stars for that alone.  WELL DONE  Encore pool attendants. Drinks served at this back pool were AWESOME. Hubs (and me too because it was funny to watch) enjoyed all the girls staring at their own boob jobs while sunbathing and flipping their hair around. I think it's his favorite part of Vegas. 

We were well above the bar and clubs so it was quiet- until the chick next door came in her room yelling from 1:30-3:30am about how ""this hotel needs to tell their guests they need to be on the guest list to get in the MFin cluuuub "". Blah blah. I was woken up 4 times from this rude guest. 
Encore gets bonus points because when I called the front desk, they made a phone call to her room and she STFUd.

They do a several things so well that so few places do. The rooms have lights. Lots of lights. So many hotels must think I always was my room to look like a lounge because there are no in-ceiling lights, and not enough lamps. No problem here, everything is light, clean, and airy. Secondly, there are drawers everywhere. Even luxury hotels often think you don't need much storage. Finally, there are electronic jacks almost everywhere. There are plugs, and charging jacks almost all over. The one place they miss is the place I spend the most of my time. The sofa. Nothing around that area.
It's a similar thing with the room controls. Just one, and it's next to the bed. It's not a moveable tablet.

I agree with some of the reviewers criticisms regarding the check in. for some reason, the check in counter is too understaffed and too small, especially during busy times. Their isn't a clear queue order, their should be a single line because each line may go painfully slower than the next. The Wynn has a private, larger check in area- the check in area at Encore is just the side of a wide hallway, almost like they forgot to design it into the master plan. Food was good at the restaurants we ate at, very good. Great steaks, though I think there are too many restaurants in the Encore\/Wynn that call themselves ""steakhouses""...not so great for variety.

Purple coated security staff are also friendly, knowledgeable and happy to help with any questions. Resort suite room was huge, and our view was spectacular over the strip and the golf course.

We had free tickets to Le Reve which was better that we had expected and would go see again.

Casino is nice...drinks are not comped at the bar poker machines at the Wynn and Encore.

There was absolutely no standing near the club.

We were given a promotional stay at the Encore for $110 a night (mid-week) and it included 2 tickets to Le Reve and a Buffet Breakfast or Lunch.

For the price we paid the stay was amazing.  Just for signing up for their red card (5 years ago) we have been given promotional stays once a year.  It's totally worth it for a couple who need to get away for a couple of days.

Also, going to Vegas mid-week is the way to go if you want to avoid the following:
Traffic
Crazy Young people 
Drunkards
etc...

The room was immaculate and spacious, through the promotion we ended up with a king suite which had a gorgeous view at the 32nd floor.  It had all the amenities including free wi-fi (big plus).

We also had a massage in the Spa, and WOW!!  rated best spa in the world 2012 in Forbes travel magazine, and you can see why.  With beauty at every corner and the smell of lavender throughout the spa, it is completely welcoming and extravagant all in one.  Although, the treatments aren't cheap the massage was amazing, by far the best massage I've ever gotten.

I don't recommend eating at the Wynn or Encore because it is just ridicoulsly priced.  That's why I didn't give it a 5 star rating.  There really wasn't anywhere cheap or quick to eat at.  We ended up paying $100 for a late night meal consisting of 1 hamburger and a penne dish with one tea and one beer.  So get your eats elsewhere.

My suite was beautiful.  I loved the chic but decidedly feminine color scheme of cream and black with accents of red.  I disputed that it was feminine but John pointed out the houndstooth wall coverings and I quickly shut my mouth.  

The suite is essentially three open and interconnected areas, a large bathroom with a soaking tub and a large shower, a bedroom area, and a tv\/lounging area.  So please be advised there are no doors (other than to the bathroom) to separate the spaces.  I didn't mind but it might make a difference for bigger groups sharing a room and sleeping spaces. 

I liked that the Encore was quiet, likely due to its location at the far end of the Strip.  But the on the downside, it was also hard to access good restaurants.  I felt that the Wynn and Encore's food offerings were subpar and the best restaurants were in the bigger hotel\/casinos.

The Panorama View King room that we booked had a clean contemporary style with subtle Asian influences. I loved the spaciousness of the separate living and sleeping spaces; plus, the view of The Strip wasn't bad either. The bed was comfortable with plush comforters and pillows. In the bathroom, the shower head was really powerful and did a good job of blasting off casino-funk.

Upgrade to a room located on a higher floor, if possible. Don't just do it for the views, but do it to minimize the sound of pounding EDM beats that travel up from Surrender.

I was also annoyed by the unhelpful front desk and wasn't impressed by the service.  I won't stay at the Encore again.  There are too many amazing options in Vegas, places with a ""wow"" factor, to bother giving the Encore a second chance.  
 
I'm giving the Encore three stars, the same rating I'm giving the Holiday Inn Express in Puerto Rico - I was actually more satisfied with the Holiday Inn -at least it lived up to my expectations.

The Lobby was so Chinese-style like~ which I liked it very much with all the red and fake flower, butterfly all around the sky\/wall of the lobby~
Checked in takes a little while because many people checking in~
We got the offer from Vegas.com, and it gives us complimentary upgrade and $75 resort credit which was a FAB! they upgraded our room to the top floor!!! (was suppose living in the lower level) to 62 floor~~ however the room we got is not facing the strip, but Hey! is free upgrade, still a good thing!~
The room was very stylish!!! and i think the room is good for the young's~ maybe to the older people might think is not THAT elegant to them...but I super Loved it! The bed was huge~ the TV stand was very cool that can switch around facing the bed side and facing the living room side.
Living room has a huge L-shape sofa facing the big window that you can see through outside. Everything was so new! and we enjoyed it very much. We regret we only stayed there for 2 nights, if one more night would be perfect!!

We also tried the restaurant inside the hotel called ""Switch"". Pricey restaurant but very cool design of the restaurant. The restaurant background will change every 10 minutes or so, music was played along when switching~ That is why the restaurant is call ""Switch"". we got the $75 resort credit, that's why we wanna give it a try~ end up we still have to pay $50 bucks total to end the bill. So is pretty pricey, but food was GREAT! should give it a try if u have the budget!! 

Overall I give this hotel 5 stars! Would love to be back!",0,0,0

I rented a Harley for a couple of days and rode north up to ring of fire state park and on the second day rode to Red Rock Canyon.  Plus, it's pretty cool riding down the strip at dusk with my hottie on the back.  Very contemporary hotel attached to the Wynn Resort & Casino.

Floor to ceiling windows & floor to ceiling mirrors on one wall (both in the bedroom & sitting area).  Very erotic, if you like voyeurism.  Stop at a store and buy some snacks & beverages as the mini bar is very expensive.  Bathrooms are HUGE.  Shower area has a rainfall showerhead with a bench in it, more than enough room for two!  Same with the bathtub: the fixtures are in the middle along the wall so I could have one end and she the other!  Had a nice dinner experience LaCave, mostly small plates, tapas.

The cabanas are worn and the furniture is extremely beaten and chipped.    We also had left over trash (a straw and a beer can) in ours.  While I realize it's a club at night that contributes to wear and tear, the $300\/day charge (not including drink and food service) was very excessive given the quality of the experience. 

We also heard a group complain that there was a sign disallowing European bathing due to a private event.  [Nothing worse than checking into a hotel only to have private events limit the expected common facilities without prior notice].  Nevertheless, the private event never seemed to materialize at any point in the day.

Sadly, they've also removed the fantastic ""Sugar & Spice\/Pizza\/Dessert"" cafe from the Wynn esplanade and replaced it with a Givenchy.    This was a great cafe where one could have lunch, coffee, dessert, etc. away from the smoke of the casino while watching the waterfalls from the outside patio.

The last day we order breakfast per room service for six am in that we had to catch a flight.  Although room service had been on time before, they somehow missed us. After placing 2 calls to dining services, it finally arrived at 6:30 as we were about to head out the door.

No new shows here. We saw Danny Ganns (he was the greatest!) and Beyonce here.  The Wynn desperately needs some new artists, if only for special events.  

Curiously, although we've been to the Encore several times since opening and they still ask us at check in if we've visited before. Also, at check out no one asked us how our stay was. Unfortunately overall, the quality of the stay has gone done a notch.",5,0,0

I had the nachos.  I had them last year, and we decided to stay at the Encore again for the nachos!  Crisp, thin, warm chips with just the right amount of salt, served in a hot, heavy Le Creuset au gratin pan so they stay warm.  A two- cheese sauce also served in a hot Le Creuset dish with sliced jalapeños, diced tomatoes and delicious olives was mild but  very tasty.  Separate dishes of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole round out the serving.  Everything was fresh and plentiful, and worth the trip back.

My wife had the beef sliders.  Substantial beef patties cooked to perfection, served on fresh Hawaiian rolls.  The onion rings were also perfectly produced, achieving that balance of crisp, golden brown batter and flavorful but not overpowering onion flavor.

Our daughter had the BLT with the thickest, chewiest bacon you have ever seen.  She said it was the best BLT she ever had.

With tip and a few soft drinks our bill came to $97.  For room service and top-notch food, it was a good deal.   Our server said that the room service kitchen is stand-alone, so they don't offer the same food in any of their restaurants (although we found similar bacon at Zoozacrackers here at Encore).",1,1,0

Well, that was because I had yet to stay at Encore.  That place is a-friggin-mazing!  It had me singing. ""Viva Las Vegas"" throughout the time I was there.  The whole time I was in Vegas I never left Encore except to go to the Wynn, between the two hotels they had everything one could need and\/or want.

Room:
We stayed on the 61st floor, not sure if it was a panoramic or resort suite.  The view, of course, was amazing (I will try to find other descriptive words throughout my review).  It looks exactly as it is pictured on the website, so I do not need to waste time describing it.  Although, the only thing myself and the person I was with said was weird or a con, is that you walk directly into the bedroom and then the living room.  One would think you would first hit the living room, so if you had any friends or whatever you could put them there.  Then you could still have the privacy and view in the room.  The bath tubs were of a good size to fit two people comfortably (don't ask how I know, I just do).  I did not find a need to use the phone in the bathroom, but I am sure someone will.  It just seemed ever so unhygienic and weird to call someone from the toilet.

Elevator:
A lil side note, the elevators were separated into floors 1-30 and 31-63.  It at times was confusing if you didn't read before you enter an elevator, but was extremely convenient as I was on one of the top floors.  Not having to stop at the numerous floors on the way to mine was a small blessing.

European Pool:
When I was told where the reservation was made I went on the website to see what it had to offer.  The European Pool was the first stop I wanted to make, as it called to me.  A great dj blasting out tunes, topless pool, adults only, food, and alcohol...Bring it on!  We were only able to go one day, as it is the popular place to see and be seen, so the chairs and such get taken very quickly.  Oh, but what an amazing time we had that one day.  Plus, they have cute chicks walking around making sure you are well hydrated and such.  Good times!",0,0,0

(who stayed here on a separate trip from my own) noted in her review, a 5-star hotel should be 5-stars across the board. Nothing should slip through the cracks. I booked the 'Wynn Getaway Package' after receiving an invitation by mail, which was supposed to come with 2 tickets to Le Reve and 2 tickets to the buffet. When I booked my stay I asked, ""Should I book the Le Reve tickets now or can I wait?"" My reservations agent indicated that it would be okay to wait until we arrived.

After reading Robert L.'s review I saw that Wynn\/Encore had decided to black out certain dates for Le Reve, without notifying those who had already booked stays. Alarmed, I called to inquire and was told that there was nothing they could do, and that I could have booked tickets had I called by November 10th. Mind you, we booked and had our credit card charged on OCTOBER 31ST and were not notified at that time that we should book the Le Reve tickets immediately. 

After much holding and arguing, the reservations agent agreed to give me the 2 tickets. 

Similarly, the Wynn management tried to credit us only $85 toward the buffet although the price that weekend was $100 for 2 people, and the Terms and Conditions clearly indicated that our buffet tickets were good for 'breakfast or lunch Monday-Friday"". After speaking with a few managers they 'waived' the additional fee.  

This is not the kind of penny-pinching behavior I would expect from a supposedly 5-star resort.

The room itself (a suite King) was gorgeous, and the only reason this is a 2-star review instead of just 1-star. Also, the gym was one of the better ones I've found in hotels, with free headphones, water bottles, and ample equipment. 

Unfortunately, the experience left such a sour taste in my mouth that I'll be taking my business elsewhere for my next stay.",5,2,0

Though I stopped going to Vegas with my family years ago, I still independently continued the tradition of heading out there every now and then.  Other than the occasional game of blackjack, I am not really drawn to Vegas by the gambling.  I actually come more for the shows, food and of course the accommodations :)

For years, Bellagio was the go-to spot for more of a luxurious stay.  After staying at the Encore, I have to say that the king has been dethroned.  The suites at Encore are really modern yet luxurious.  Huge bathroom with dual sinks, tub and shower.  Bed is plush and ultra comfy. Couch & office areas are nice to chill out in and set up a little work space.  Extra upgrade to the top floors are definitely worth it for the scenic view 60 floors up from the strip.  Other cool room touches like the bathroom TV and electric one-touch shades were nice.

For me, a great room still requires equally impressive facilities to go along with your stay.  The Encore & Wynn complex serve up some of the best restaurants Vegas has to offer.  Tried Daniel Boulud last night (review coming soon) and it was amazing.  Up to bat tonight is the SW Steakhouse which I also heard is pretty stellar for carnivores.  For those who are like me and have already seen O and every other Cirque show, I've heard Le Reve is definitely worth checking out.  I'll provide an update on that after I see it tonight.

The pool area at Encore is really nice as well with a cool bar right in the center of the European pool.  Only complaint I have is that the gym at Encore is an extra-pay facility.  As much as I feel guilty for not burning off all the excess calories I'm putting in...$30 for a day pass kind of makes me want to put off working out till I get back home.

Since it is Vegas, I guess the gambling area is worth mentioning.  I really like the floor at Encore.  It reminds me of Bellagio but with a more intimate feel.  The decor is upscale with a warm, reddish theme.  Though smoking is allowed, it just doesn't seem as smoky as other casinos.  I'm not sure if the clientele are more of the non-smoking crowd or the hotel just has better air circulation...either way it works for me since I really hate smoke.

Overall, Encore is pretty damn awesome.  For me, it is officially the new go-to spot when I want to check out Vegas.",8,3,7

When we were making the reservation, we got a deal to get a suite with 2 queen beds. She verified with the person on the phone that we'd get 2 queen beds because on the website it says they only have suites with a king bed. My friend gets there, checks in and of course there aren't any rooms with 2 queen beds. The good thing is after complaining we got a roll away cot that was actually pretty comfortable. 

Being such a new hotel, I think the staff is slightly inexperienced. My friend had added my name to the room because I was arriving at a different time and at first the person at the front desk couldn't find my name on the reservation and after a minute or so was like oh I looked in the wrong place... uhhhh ok? Then when directing us to the elevator to get to our room, we got the wrong directions and ended up somewhere else... 

The location is only ok. It's all the way at the end of the strip so it's not as easy to get around but if the weather isn't bad, that's not too much of an issue.  It is close enough to TI, Wynn and Venetian that if you usually only stay around that area than it's no biggie.  Also it's right across from this large mall so there is plenty of shopping. 

Ok so the good... 

The room is really nice and up to what I expected. It was nice to have the drapes open and close right by the bedside. The bathroom is great and being a new hotel, you can tell the towels, sheets etc. are all crisp and clean. 

A big plus was that we had left our curling iron on in the room. We called the hotel and they helped us go into the room and turn it off.  I know it benefits them more than me because if their hotel burnt down after opening for 3 weeks would be a disaster but it was still nice of them to do it.  So overall the staff is very friendly and they try to be helpful.

Checking out was also very easy.  As soon as we came down the elevators, they had 2 people waiting to check your name off and that was it. Check out down.  Fast and easy.  We didn't have to return any keys because they print your name on them which I thought was kind of cool.

And other random comments... 
So this hotel is definitely geared towards an Asian clientele (and more specifically chinese) because the red from the hotel was overwhelming. Also floor 40-49 is missing. 

The casino seemed kind of empty for a vegas hotel. During the day, the bj tables were around $10 even though it was Sat. At night I think you could find tables for $15.",2,1,1

Our room was on the 36th floor with a view of the strip and the pools below.  I had no issue with noise, but that's probably because I was at the club responsible for many of the noise complaints I've read about until it closed for the night.

Now, I've been to Vegas dozens of times before but this place was so beyond my previous Vegas hotel experiences that in a way it felt like it was my first time as well. 

While I was use to a standard room being somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 - 400 square feet, the Encore's standard rooms are 700 - 740 square feet and feature floor to ceiling windows. We may not have been lucky enough to get a view of the strip but when you're 63 floors up, any twinkling cityscape is romantic at night.

The casino floor was also a sight to see. The spider marble that seemed to be everywhere you look, the huge hand blown glass fixtures and chandeliers the populate the entire casino, the naturally lit garden and shopping areas, the stylized butterflies that permeate the entire motif and every last little detail all come together to redefine for me what a casino should be. Not once did I look someplace and feel that it was kitschy or cheap. And if you're into high end shopping, the stores offer so much upscale variety that as we were walking through the shopping area my girlfriend had to tell me to take her by the hand and pull her along lest she stop dead in her tracks every five steps when yet another beautiful and expensive object would catch her eye. Even the hotel's cafe was beyond expectation. Most Vegas hotel cafes seem to be little more than a convenient place to get a slightly overpriced club sandwich at three in the morning when you're drunk and ready to turn in for the night. At the Encore's society cafe however, they not only have menu items that  go well beyond what you'd be able to get at the local Denny's but also arrives at your table freshly and beautifully prepared.

The reasons that I am not giving the Encore five stars are somewhat minor but I still feel that they interfered with the trip being absolutely perfect. When we first arrived all the computers were down and we had to wait something like two to three hours before we could check in. I understand that everyone has technical problems but I really think that a major operation should have some kind of backup system so they can at least process people while their computers are freaking out. Another disappointment was that the pool seemed to close way too early and my girlfriend and I ultimately never got a chance to use it. I just don't see why they can't keep it open to adults on into the evening especially considering that even after nightfall it had to be a good 90 degrees outside. The third issue I had was a little incident that occurred after my girlfriend and I had gotten back to the hotel and were standing around for a few minutes before going back to the room. We had been walking around and just generally enjoying ourselves all day and my girlfriend's shoes had been making her feet sore so she decided to take them of for a moment. We were quickly approached by someone who insisted that she put her shoes back on. Admittedly this is really minor and I understand them enforcing a dress code but it still rubbed me the wrong way, especially because there didn't seem to be any courtesy in the way it was said. My only major complaint was that there was no shuttle service. In the past, one could take a shuttle to the convention center and catch the monorail to travel up and down the strip. For one reason or another when we were there this was not an available option and we had to walk all the way through the resort, past the venetian and through Harrah's just to catch the monorail. By the second night we just said ""screw it"" and took cabs.

Over all it was still the best time I had ever had in Vegas. I just hope that there are more transportation options the next time I go.",0,1,1

Fortunately both trips have been on either my employer or my husbands! Which is nice perk considering it is a very pricy hotel. I do get email offers occasionally so you can shop around for good deals but of course during the week. 
The updsides to the hotel it is simply gorgeous, from the hotel, to the grounds, the decor is stylish, trendy, and over the top lavish. Their detail to attention is impecable.Their basic king suites, are very large probably about 600 sq feet which is very large for a hotel room. More like a small studio apartment. Full bathroom with tub and shower combo, double sinks and private toilet. Linens on bed are luxiourous, roomy sitting area to look out at the strip from  ceiling to floor windows, there is a desk to work at if you here on business. 
 
Most of the employees are quite friendly and helpful.Lots of high end of shopping, night clubs, restaurants, and of course their amazing spa and fitness center. 
Make sure you watch the ""Wynn Infomerrcial"" that plays non stop on the TV  to learn what all the two hotels have to offer.

The downsides to the hotel  is location, although across from the Fashion mall it is at least a $10 one way cab trip to the main part of the strip. This can be a pain if you want to get out to other hotels or site see. Other downsize is nothing affordable about this hotel. I mean if you are part of the 1% this place is for you! 

While I would love to shop at Chanel, Hermes,Oscar de le Renta and Louis Vuitton, I had to head to the Vegas outlets to get my shopping fix. Meals are pricy, a $24 seafood sandwich for lunch, $18 cocktails, $22 omelettes, etc.    Our last day we did find a deli \/ grill place that was located on the Wynn side where prices seemed more affordable but we never tried it so I cant recommend it.  
Fortunately most meals were covered by the company, that included adult beverages, and even a trip to the spa that is simply opulent.

On my last trip, we stayed at the Wynn Encore. Navigating our way there off the strip was interesting. With all the construction, it was a little difficult to figure out which turn was for our hotel. I wouldn't be mad at a bigger sign or a little heads up!

The hotel itself is amazing. It's so beautiful. They really did pay attention to detail when they made this. Sure, the butterflys and all the red everywere might be a bit over the top, but it's Vegas and everything is over the top. 

Upon check in, they upgraded us to a strip view room. The suite was so impressive. The bathrooms were huge, with plenty of room to get ready. I might just be a perv, but the first thing I noticed was the ""shower massager"" at waist level. One would assume that would be used in compliance with the ""intimacy kit""? Way to go Mr. Wynn, you dirty old man. This is definitely my kind of place :)

I was sold on the hotel once I realized I could operate all things hotel related from my bed. Closing and opening the drapes while still in bed was quite helpful the ""morning after"" when I was too hungover to function. The room service is great too. I highly recommend getting the chicken noodle soup. It was amazing for my hangover!! 

As far as gambling goes, I won a little here. Nothing to write home about, but enough to cover dinner one night. I loved the layout of the casino. Some are so confusing, this one was well planned. The true test was when we came back drunk and got separated, we still managed to find each other because my boyfriend knew exactly which video poker machine I thought was gonna ""make me rich""

I look forward to coming back here soon. If not for anythign mroe than gettign more chicken noodle soup.",0,1,0

The staff, locals and visitors were extremely rude and racist individuals. XS, the Casino and connected food services all carried employees with disgusting attitudes. Management and security were unprofessional. 

After leaving XS, my siblings and I tried to assist a man who blacked out in entrance of casino building. His phone was about to fall out of his hands so my siblings (who are both in the medical field) checked his pulse and breathing, then asked me to check for his emergency contacts in his phone. He had a lock on his phone with no emergency contacts so I proceeded to place his phone is his pocket for safety. After turning his head incase he was to vomit they asked me to go get help and water and paper towels. Then suddenly a woman and her two men bombarded us accusing us of trying to steal from him. We explained that we were trying to help and she says people of our color could never be trusted of any help. Others began taking under their breath agreeing and threatening us. Security walked by,  scuffles and walks away. The woman then slaps the man and yanks him up yelling  that she's saving him from thieves. He woke up petrified and could have easily gone into shock. She ran him around the corner. 

We were also denied service in a few restaurants because we did not ""look"" the theme. I will never provide this business with services ever again.

In all seriousness,  I loved the Encore because it was slightly off the strip, a bit away from all the action, and I had been to Vegas a million times and just didn't need THAT.  You could obviously still stay here and cab it over to the center of the strip to go out, but if you are trying to avoid that, this is a great place to do it.

The rooms are beautiful and spacious but do not be fooled by the word ""suite"".  We had a ""suite"" at the Encore and a ""room"" at the Wynn and the two were pretty much the same, although the room at the Wynn was definitely less expensive.  The bathroom is my dream bathroom. Seriously, one day I want to build a bathroom in my house mirrored after it.  There is a large tub and shower with two sinks and a vanity, and a TV on the wall so you can watch TV while getting dressed.  The toilet is separated within the same room, so you could have someone in the toilet while someone else is doing their makeup.

First off, the bed in our room was the comfiest bed I have ever slept in.  I wanted to take the pillows home, and the sheets, ugh--SO COZY!  I felt very at home in their rooms, and considering I had a cold for part of the trip, it was necessary that I be comfortable and sleep well.

The tables were expensive, but I didn't lose money so no complaints here!  Considering that I'm cheap and most people who stay here are not, the tables are fitting for typical Encore guests.  They have a good variety of cheap and expensive slots as well. 

Housekeeping - I don't know what the hell happened here, but every night I made sure the ""Do not disturb"" switch was on so that the housekeeping would know not to wake me and the BF (we sleep late, like until 1 pm.)  WELL, two of the mornings we were there, they woke us up with that damn doorbell at 9 a.m.  I'm not sure if the thing just reset in the middle of the night or they unlocked our door, turned it off, and then rang the doorbell.  Either way, it shouldn't have happened.  Also, one of the housekeepers refused to leave until I let her put new information booklets in the room.  WHAT THE HELL!

Billing - If I purchased a particular package, keep track of which perks I get. It's not that difficult!  Also, don't disagree with me when I say that I get free buffet passes BEFORE checking what my package allows. Customer's always right, right?  Well, NOT HERE!  I got my buffets comped eventually, but come on, when we pay SO much to stay here, we should be treated better.  The guy checking out next to me was having similar issues, so this wasn't a fluke.

1st impressions are important, right?  too bad encore seriously sucks at first impression.  

besides superficial impressions of the hotel (don't get me wrong, this hotel is beyond gorgeous) but the check-in situation totally ruined my expectations for encore.

1.  uh, yeah, hi, where do we line up for check-in?  oh wait, there are no ropes and absolutely no order.  the greeters standing around the registration area are useless too. 
2.  yes, it is standard and understandable for all hotels in vegas to have check-in time at 3pm because no drunk ass can ever wake up before 12 to pack their shit and leave vegas.  no one ever wants to leave vegas.  however, i arrived at encore at 4 pm, our room was not available.   
3.  they asked us to ""wait around"" and will ""call"" us once the room was available.  we waited for about 30 minutes, then my boiling point busted.  that's when i demanded that the manager and i needed a 'talk'.  

by his managerial power we were granted a room on the spot, with 2 meager cocktail comps and floor upgrade, sorry bud, not enough to make up for your a*holeness.

This is the addition to Wynn as the name suggests. I think it was designed well for what it is - a supplement to the main resort yet can still stand alone in almost every way with small exceptions.

The rooms and ambiance and decor are all top notch. Pool the best around. Wynn has a better location to shops next door and across the street. Encore will most likely be a longer walk no matter where your going. If the price between Encore and Wynn is similar go with Wynn. Other similar options to explore are Bellagio and Palazzo. 

Perhaps you just want the most expensive, posh, sterile boutique hotel. Nobu at Caesars, Skylofts at MGM, or the Mandarin Oriental might be contenders for you to further research.

Wynn is really built from the inside out. Be sure and step foot inside before you judge it. Bellagio for the record seems to be built from the outside in with all the eye candy that is the lake\/fountain up front.

I tend to prefer the hotels that were never added on to. In my mind Bellagio went down a notch with their added on tower - the perfect flow was wrecked along withe the beautiful stairway that countless newlyweds utilized as the backdrop to their prized wedding photos.

The Encore is north of the Wynn resort, and they are connected via a long esplanade of retail shops. Each hotel tower has its own restaurants, casino and pool. The Encore's casino is about half the size of the Wynn's and it also has fewer restaurants. But the two hotels basically feel like one property, so it doesn't really matter. 

Pros: Gorgeous, spacious suites with neat high tech features -- like being able to close the window curtains, turn off the lights and set the ""privacy"" sign from your nightstand. Comfortable beds, nice soaking tubs, double sinks and bathrobes. You can use the special ""Wynn"" channel on your TV to check out, review your hotel tab or view the waiting list in the poker room. Easy access to the room elevators from the registration desk and self carpark. Beautiful pool area. The hotel is connected to Wynn, so you have easy access to all of that hotel's facilities, restaurants and shops. Good entertainment options: Le Reve production show, numerous bars and three nightclubs.

Cons: $14\/day for wireless Internet access in your room. Most of the restaurants fall into the ""very expensive"" category. It's at the northern end of the strip, an easy walk to the Venetian, Palazzo, Treasure Island, Mirage and Fashion Show Mall; but if you want to explore all of the strip it could be a long haul or necessitate a cab ride, depending on your energy and fitness level. This is not the place to stay if you have a tight budget, but it is worth a splurge, especially if you can get a special promotional rate.",1,0,0

I love Wynn as well but the contemporary Euro chic style of Encore is more my style. This is the only hotel that I will stay in while I am in Las Vegas (well next to the Sky Lofts that is!). As I mentioned, the decor is very modern and contemporary with a lot of red and black throughout. It also boasts large decorative butterflies throughout.

I typically stay in a tower suite when I stay there and they are truly magnificent. The hotel has some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. 

As far as the service goes, it's everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Everyone from the staff at the reception, to room service, to the concierges are absolutely amazing and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and are well taken care of.

As you already know, Las Vegas is home to many, many fabulous restaurants and several are at Encore\/Wynn. Stratta and Alex are my two favorites. 

Two of my favourite nightclubs in Las Vegas are also at Encore\/Wynn; Blush and XS. On my last visit, we had a table with bottle service reserved at both clubs. The service was outstanding. Our host was extremely attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to ensure we had a wonderful time. Blush is a smaller, boutique type nightclub with pink and black lighting and colours throughout the club which is perfect as those are my two favourite colours! XS is truly a magnificent club and is a must see! It is centered around Encore's massive swimming pool. The club has outdoor cabanas and candlelight throughout the outdoor areas. One of the coolest aspects of this club aside from it being built around the pool is the rotating chandelier on the dance floor.

If you like shopping at high end boutiques and love couture then Encore\/Wynn is for you! The properties boast an ultra fabulous shopping esplanade made of up of favourites such as Chanel, Hermes, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Rock & Republic, and many more.

Overall Encore is truly worth it's price because of the phenomenal 5-star service and the magnificence of the hotel itself. Everytime I walk into the hotel, it puts a smile on my face because I know I always have the best experience there. It is truly a pleasure to stay at Encore while in Las Vegas.",1,1,1

I'm chronically critical of such establishments, even though I'm a very frequent traveler, and stay in hotels all the time.  Even luxury hotels bum me out sometimes - and often feel either over the top or just overly expensive.

And, I don't really like Vegas very much.

So, with that as the backdrop, I'm giving the Encore 5 stars. It was awesome.  Our room was perfect.  We had one of the panoramic ""suites"" (although calling it a suite is a bit of an exaggeration - I'd call it a ""large-ish room with a separate seating area.""  But, it was well-appointed, the bed was comfortable, and we had a killer view of the strip.

We ate a few meals on the property - including Botero (which I'll review when I get to it) which was great.  I would avoid the buffet next time, but there are plenty of other places to get different levels of food, from casual to top-of-the-line.  All in all, I had no complaints.

Most importantly, the Encore did its job for being ""cozy"" - but still with just the right level of Vegas energy.  It was high-end, but somehow avoided being obnoxious.  Not sure how they do that, but I liked it.

I can't imagine going back to Vegas too soon, but the next time I'm there, I'll be back at the Encore.",2,2,1

The view from my room was looking right out onto The Strip through a large floor to ceiling, wall to wall window. The beds were very comfortable with very soft and fluffy pillows. (If you prefer firm pillows you won't find them here although they may have some available upon asking.) 
This hotel is connected to Wynn and is an easy walk to visit. 
The decor is beautiful, and the hotel is pretty much brand new!
One downside is it is located pretty much at the end of The Strip so it would be quite the walk to get to where most of the nightlife is. Directly across the street is a huge indoor shopping mall called Fashion Show. 
The rooms are clean and well lit. Everything is automated from lights to curtains. The bathroom was spacious with a large tub and all glass shower. The bathroom was completed with a TV.

I had joined the Red Card Loyalty program during a stay last year and received a nice offer for a room\/buffet package, so I booked a standard king room and requested (via an e-mail acknowledged by Encore staff) a high floor and away from the elevators (quiet, please). 
We arrived on my birthday, December 3.  The young man helping us at check-in informed me that because of the room deal we had reserved and the fact that the hotel was nearly full, the best they could do would be a north facing room on the 18th floor (E1825).  I had imagined a north facing room would have a nice downtown view and maybe some nice vistas of the mountains, but  I was wrong.  Mostly it was a view of the tacky strip malls just north of the Encore, the excavation\/partial construction of the next mega-resort diagonally north of the Encore, and Circus Circus dead center in the frame.  
This room is also immediately adjacent to the elevators.  After being jolted awake (again) by a passing reveler I checked out the Tower Suite room photos on the TripAdvisor website and decided that might be our best option to save the birthday weekend and give us the experience we were looking for.  My wife and I had read some TripAdvisor reviews of the Tower Suites rooms (very nice), and after our experience Thursday night it we decided to pay the extra $65 per night to upgrade.
On check-in the clerk had suggested that if we found the room unacceptable we could contact the desk on Friday morning between 10 and 11am and try our luck again; due to the hallway noise issues and our wish for a better view we decided to seek an upgrade.
Friday morning I called down to the desk from my room and spoke with an agent (Laurie). She checked availability in the Tower Suites section and found us a nice room on the south side on a much higher floor.   I was really looking forward to treating myself to a nice belated birthday gift, an upgraded room with a nice view and a more luxurious experience.
I told Laurie to put our name on it. She told me the room only needed to be serviced and inspected before it would be ready for us, between 1pm and 2pm.  Laurie told me that the Tower Suites desk would text me as soon as the room was ready.
My wife and I walked over to Fashion Show mall and shopped for a couple hours, then headed back to Encore to change rooms.  I hadn't received the text message, so I called the desk to see how the room change was coming along.
Laurie picked up the call, and as I started to introduce myself and the reason for my call she told me that she was the person who I had spoken with earlier, but that now she did not have a room for me after all. Her explanation was that the Tower Suite room I had been promised was given instead to a casino guest; she was authorized to give me a standard king room on a higher floor in Encore, but nothing was available for me in the Tower Suites.  The promise was broken and I had been bumped.  Nothing personal, I was just collateral damage from a business decision.
Had I been told when I called to inquire about an upgrade that nothing was available I wouldn't have been real happy but I would have understood.  But I had been promised a specific room, had agreed to the terms, and was ready to move.  I was looking forward to it, and it turned into a broken promise.

Every employee I met during our stay was cordial and as helpful as they could be; I especially liked the attitudes of the bell and valet staffs. Nice people.  But the decision that was made to pull the room away from me that had already been promised marred what would have been a perfect birthday weekend.  Not nice.",1,0,0

As everyone has commented, the casino decor will have you wearing sunglasses inside, but hey this is Vegas--where the more gaudy you are, the more you fit in!  Everyone kept telling me how nice the place was, but when I got here, I wasn't so impressed--lots of color, especially red, lots of bling, deep deep bars with rows of impressive liquor, plush carpeting, butterfly motifs--just kind of what I expected from Vegas.  It took me until the last day to really appreciate the Encore, because by then I've visited several other casinos and each time I came back, I felt a  relative sense of serenity and relief.

We registered at the Wynn, asked for as high a floor as possible and they put us on the 29th floor, without an upgrade.  It turns out they have, I believe, three sets of elevators:  one for fls 1-30, one for flrs 31-64; and another set in the other corner of the casino for the tower suites.   The even number rooms face South, which will give you a view of the strip--the higher even numbers will have your strip view partially blocked by the Wynn hotel, and you will be closer to the XS nightclub, which can be quite loud when they open the pool area up to 4am.  If you're the partying type, ask for low even numbers; if you're a light sleeper and staying over the weekend, ask for odd numbers so you're on the other side of XS.

The suites(they're all suites) are the antithesis of Vegas--simple elegant lines, easy beige\/black colors, comfortable functional, modern classic furniture, thoughtful amenities like automatic curtain\/sheers, separate hand showerheads, bathroom tvs, and a swivel flatscreen for bed and living room viewing.  Service was prompt and professional:  being addressed by name by hotel operators; we were missing a remote, and within minutes a short tuxed fellow presented us with a remote on a platter.  It really was comforting returning to this hotel after a day of walking and sightseeing.  

The casino is muted, almost hushed tones compared to all the other casinos, and especially in light of its flamboyant decor.  I don't like a lot of bells and whistles the rare times I gamble, so this was very pleasant and comfortable.  Everyone was very professional and helpful, and seemed to enjoy where they work.

Some cons:  staying at the hotel doesn't comp you into XS, although they do let you cut in line if you pay full price.  Nor does it help you cut in the buffet line.  There is a fridge ONLY for their beverages, and food from outside is strongly discouraged, so what do you do with leftovers?  You have to drive through the entire LV blvd to get to the hotel, so figure out some shortcuts.  The pool closes early, but I guess all Vegas pools do so you'll go back inside and spend money.  $15 a day for wireless.

First thing you notice when you come in are the huge red chandeliers right in the middle of the check in area. Amazing!!!

The main reason why I booked this hotel is because you get more for your money in the sense that the rooms are huge! Black and beige are the dominant colors in the room decoration. 

I love that you can turn the lights on and off with a click of a button. As well as closing the curtains and putting the privacy in your room. Great convenience.  And the best part, it's right next to your bed. So you don't have to hit your toes with everything around you trying to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The beds are oh so comfy!!! But the robes......OMG!!!!!! I need one in my life! The bathrooms are pretty much the size of a regular room in any other hotel.

Now, the reason as to why I gave this hotel 4 stars and not 5.
Upon arrival, we were told that the hotel holds $150 a NIGHT, we stayed 4 nights so that's $600. So go ready for that! This was our second time in Vegas and this is the first time I have ever heard of a hotel holding so much per night. Oh, aside from paying resort fees. Another reason why I gave it 4 stars, the pool area isn't as nice as other hotels. I prefer the one at the wynn, which is just a few steps away. And a plus is that if you stay at the encore, you can visit the pool at the wynn as much as you like! The casinos at the encore are super nice, but the Wynn casinos looked a little outdated to me. 

The downside of staying at the south of the strip is that you have to do some major foot work to get to the good stuff on the strip. Bellagio fountains, Paris Eiffel Tower, etc. so be prepared to waste more on taxis than usual. Unless you rent a car. Which in my opinion isn't worth it if you're visiting the strip. Too much traffic. 

Last but not least, the restaurants in this hotel are extremely expensive! Even breakfast. It's over priced. We all know vegas is overpriced, but this hotel takes the cake! Now, the food at the restaurants was great Dont get me wrong, but definitely way too overpriced.

the only negative is how expensive the place is. EVERYTHING is money there. however, you should know that going in like i did. if money isn't an issue for you, then you absolutely have to stay in encore at some point. you will not be disappointed.

My husband and I wanted to get away for a few days during the week (Tuesday - Thursday) so we headed off to Las Vegas for some fun. I booked a standard King room at the Encore. When we arrived to check in our reserved room was not ready. The front desk offered us an upgrade to the Tower Suites for only $85 more a night (total of $170 for both nights), which included additional amenities like access to their separate VIP pools, free wifi, breakfast, etc. Sounded like a great deal, since it's usually $150 more a night for that kind of an upgrade, so we took and were able to check in right away. While we were unpacking and getting settled in we noticed the room looked a little different, the bathroom do not have private toilet room (standard at all Wynn locations) the bed was a little lower then we are used to, the closet was a weird height, shower had bars all around it, etc. We realized they had put us in a handicapped room (my husband is 6'2 and I'm 5'6 so this is uncomfortable for us!). We went down to the front desk and explained all this and asked that we not be charged for the upgrade (seemed to be the fairest thing) and leave it at that so we would be further inconvenienced. The manager was NOT accommodating! She would not remove the upgrade and only offered to give us some chocolates. After we went back and forth she was willing to move us to a different room (higher floor & a better view) but would not make it right by removing the upgrade charge for our inconvenience. Had they explained that the only upgraded room available was a handicapped room I would have made a different decision. Wynn\/Encore is completely short sighted! Instead of making me happy and realizing that they would make  that up $170 and 10x more through my gambling, they have now lost a customer for life.

The Encore hasn't quite grown into itself yet, meaning that it doesn't feel full or happening like the Wynn.. but it has all the potential to get there. The pools are smaller than the Wynn but nice. And the restaurants are pretty good too.

A couple of things to consider for your stay here: get a room that's as high up as possible. I was on the 34th floor and could hear the dance music all night. It was hard to sleep and even when we switched rooms, we had the same problem. Also, cabs don't come here as often and the cab line can get quite long. Give yourself some time to get around.

In fact, everyone who works here is on point - attentive, friendly, professional - way above some of the other Vegas hotels I've stayed at.
The casino floor and the shopping\/dining areas are beautiful, and you'll see some beautiful people here too, that's for sure.  I felt a little under-dressed more than once but I guess that's on me.
My only traveler tip would be to get your room facing north, towards the mountains instead of the pools.  Loud music from the clubs below may keep you up at night.  That said, I was on the far east end of the hotel, it may not be as bad on the west, and the view of the Strip will be better too.

Sometimes the idea of ""Vegas"" is starkly different than the reality.  In your mind you're picturing tuxedos and martinis but all you really find are drunken loudmouths wearing flip flops.  The Wynn properties are kind of a step back into that idea of ""Vegas"" as being a place of excitement, class, and luxury - and you getting to take part in that - if only for a brief time.",0,0,0

There was absolutely nothing negative about our stay here. All of the staff was super friendly, the rooms fabulous, the food fantastic... really, I could not step foot outside the resort and be completely happy. 

I haven't been to Rehab Sunday or Wet Republic yet, but the Euro pool was a blast... after all, if you're the ones bringing the party, what does it matter where you go? Sure, there were some ladies that should have kept their bikini tops on, but you can't knock anyone who's comfortable in their own skin even if it's fake. Get to the pool by 9am to reserve prime lounge chairs, otherwise make some friends and offer to buy drinks in exchange for them.

We stayed at the Encore earlier this summer and had the most disappointing experience.

Here's my beef:
-Upon our check-in, they sold us on a $50\/night upgrade.  When we compared to the other guests in our group who did not upgrade, we realized we were completely ripped off.  However, being in the Towers did keep us away from the XS 4am music so many other yelpers complained about.
-We were also told there was a special pool included in our upgrade.  What they meant to say was that THE WYNN has a special pool for their tower guests, we had to schelp ourselves to the main pool.
-Crusty room service cart was left in our room for 3 days!!!  
-Encore Casino bars do not comp drinks.  I was told (even at the high roller bar) that I needed to move 3 feet to a slot machine, order my drink from a cocktail waitress (after flagging them down) and then return to the bar if I wanted to play the bar machines.  Or pay full price, which I what I ended up doing 90% of the time.  This is retarded.  When I complained, I was told ""No one cares what you think"" by a sexy Patrick Swayze looking bartender.  We proceeded to have a whole conversation about how none of the Encore employees give a hoot how much I'm paying to be on vacation AT THEIR HOTEL.  He explained that they were enduring large series of layoffs and the entire staff was disgruntled.
-I had the EXACT same ""No one cares about you or your damn vacation"" with another pretty boy bartender at the boobie pool bar.  While these 2 guys were nice enough to me during these awful convos, they were perfectly clear about the fact that I am better off staying elsewhere in Vegas.  WTF???!!!  They were completely dogging their own hotel.
-We had a cabana 2 days in a row, and only received decent service for 1\/2 a day.  The poor girl also sang the same song, telling us that they were severely short staffed and she was doing her best.  Our other servers were so non-existent, our group took turns walking across the pool area to the bar.  What fun is a cabana without a cabana boy (or girl)???

The only good memory I have of the Encore were my room service fries.  Those were amazing.  The decor was pretty, but nothing could make up for the (lack of ) service when we're forking over major dough.  Sinatra's had good pasta and there's a great bartender in the red bar from NY.  Seriously, that's all I got.  

Go elsewhere.",6,5,3

It's on the quieter side of the hotel and has a nice view (see my pictures).  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Encore.  It's a smaller hotel on the north side of the Strip, so if you're looking for something with a lot of casino action, then this is not the place for you.  It has a few high end shops in between Encore and the Wynn hotel.  It's a easy, quick walk to the Wynn.  

The room has a large bathroom with separate bathtub and shower and an additional door for the toilet.  There is a large closet with a luggage rack and small safe (set your own combination).  We had a large king bed that was very comfortable and more importantly, the pillows were soft and fluffy.  There is several dressers for your clothes, a mini-fridge with all sorts of drinks and a mini-snack bar.  Towards the end of the room, there's a nice couch and a desk and chair.  Then, there's the large bay window so you can view Vegas!  The TV swivels 270 degrees, so you can watch it either from the bed or the couch.

Everything is top notch - room, service, concierge, interior, casino, restaurants, and clubs.  The only thing that wasn't in service when we were there was the pool.  It was drained and closed.  I would imagine the hotel was preparing for Christmas and New Year's.

I liked the fact that the parking lot is right next to the hotel entrance, so you don't have to walk a mile in order to reach the casino\/hotel entrance.  If you have a car, like we did, then it's an easy drive to all the other hotels on the Strip and to the old downtown Vegas (which I heard has been improved tremendously).

At Encore, you will most likely be charged the $25 resort fee on top of the room rate.  You may be able to find better rates on hotwire, hotels.com or priceline rather than going to the encore website.

You do not have to walk miles to get to your room or from one end of the casino to the other.  Parking is very convenient.  The location on the strip is great - across from the mall and near other nice casino properties.  It is only a short indoor stroll to the Wynn to have a larger casino and more restaurant selections.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed (although showing just a little wear and tear) and we never have heard noise from the hallways or from other guests.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  We loved the buffet - probably the best we have been to in Las Vegas.  

The only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if you just want coffee, juice, yogurt, or a muffin in the morning the prices are high - the ventilation in the casino isn't great -  the casino seems to have tightened up on slot machine payouts - and if your room is on the Strip side you may feel or hear vibrations from the nightclub (we did one night - on the 25th floor - but we were warned about it when we checked in and chose that side of the building anyway.)

we got there friday and the check was long, which i didn't mind. The guy at the front desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade to a room on the higher floors (59th to be exact) so we can get a view of the strip, so we paid extra for a good view. What i didn't expect was getting a view of the back side of the strip. Also, if we didn't turn on the AC we could hear the people upstairs partying and screaming. for a high class hotel, their walls are paper thin. I was pretty upset and called the front desk to switch rooms and their only response was that they were booked and that we would be put on a waiting list to switch rooms the next day. Secondly, it was our wedding weekend and a friend had sent us cakes to our room.. which the idiot hotel charged us for instead of our friend. Then when i called to ask for a couple of plates for the cake, Encore said there would be a $5 dollar charge for each plate sent up! WTF??? seriously? i swear that hotel would try to charge you for everything.

We stayed in a tower king suite, we were offered a strip view or a mountain view. We were told if we wanted a strip view we would hear the club noise. So we decided to stay on the mountain side. 
The whole vibe of the hotel wasn't welcoming even as we walked through it. We went to the pool and was charged a dine in fee. The waitress at the pool had to check if we were staying at the hotel again even after we were checked at the entrance. We paid in cash and she never brought back our change. I asked two other waitresses to check into it and they notified me that the other waitress had left for her shift already. We waited about an hour for our change.

Saturday, 8:00 am.  Was our room ready?  Yes, it was!!
Was this indicative of our Encore experience?  Yes, it was!!
Encore sets the bar.  And sets it damn high.
Spotlessly clean, large, beautifully decorated room.  Bed and linens off the charts comfortable. ihome alarm clock. Bedside controls for EVERYTHING.  Electronic privacy sign\/maid service.  And speaking of maid service, 3 times a day.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Including the lovely night time service of a little mat with his-n-hers slippers on each side of the bed.  The correct side, I might add. ( ? )
Floor to ceiling windows, large, well-appointed bathroom.  Complimentary LV Review- Journal and NY Times.  Complimentary bottled water, replenished 3 times daily. 
Included in the mini-bar items, an 'Intimacy Kit'.  Tempted to open it just to see what it was all about, but I wasn't $30 worth of curious.  Guess I can imagine.  
*TIP*  Ask for an even numbered high room for a strip view.  
What you don't see is every bit as important as what you do see: no promoters, no strollers, no huge groups carrying armloads of bags from the local Walgreens and cases of cheap beer on their way upstairs to potentially destroy the beautiful rooms and disturb their neighbors.  No taxi line, they are kept in a tunnel and I'm told Encore is the only property to have bathrooms and tvs for the comfort of the waiting cab drivers.  Nice.

CASINO:
This is unfortunately where Encore loses a Liz-Star (TM).  There's a good progressive .25 VP going here, but only 24 machines.  24, Steve?  No .50 VP, period. A paltry 8 $1 VP machines, which is what Big Jeff plays. So, it's impossible to find a seat at the 32 machines unless it's 4am.  Well, at 4am I'm ok with that, but what about 4pm?  So there's a beautiful bar in the casino with Multi-Denomination VP.  Ok, let's do that.  Except drinks are not comped at the bar.  Not only are drinks not comped at the bar, a cup of coffee is $4.50.  Surely I jest?  Not at all.  See Lizzie and BJ, leaving.  This I consider to be a big hole in strategy.  If there weren't a lot of VP players, seats would have been available. As far as the bar goes, if I'm playing VP at $1.25 per hand, and my husband is playing at $5 per hand, roughly 400 hands per hour each, I do believe our coffee should be comped.  8 feet away at a penny slot it would have been.  BTW, the bar was empty. Wonder why.
 
Nonetheless, the customer service at Encore is truly astounding. There is a great lobby bar at the base of the guest elevators that does a terrific coffee service in the morning, either sit-down or to-go.
Every inch of this property is beautiful.  BEAUTIFUL. 
In my opinion, Encore lacks nothing except decent video poker.  Easy fix.",14,11,10

I was charged 233.45 for using the mini bar though.  Im not sure how they can charge me for somethign that was impossible to use. No Joke... it was not even opened. I even asked that the snacks, on the sensor, be removed, the minute I walked into the room, JUST TO MAKE SURE, that nobody would accidentally knock something off the sensor for too long and me be charged for it.

After speaking with front desk, and front desk manager.. they could only say that I signed an authorization allowing them to take my money.  

What i dont understand, is how they can take my money and say i used the mini bar, and the mini bar charge is $233.45 but not have any proof of when i used the mini bar... just that i did use the mini bar... or that it is a mini bar authorization. SO CONFUSING!! these people.

Then I spoke with accounting, who I was told could send me an email of the proof they had to charge me.

After speaking with one person whos first language was not english, and her english was horrible, i asked to speak with another.

That person was able to send me an email... the email contained INNACCURATE INFO...soo fkn funny. these peoples proof is wrong. i dont understand how a 5 star resort can operate like this, the email i got showed 150.00 charge, which was the authorization... and then it showed 383.45. which is 150.00 bucks more then what was taken out of my account.  which is obviously the mistake of someone adding the 2 charges together, and keeping the 150.00 charge still on, as if the 150.00 and the 233.45 was not added together. i mean this is just horrible accounting.  

They do not have any reason, or proof, that the mini bar door was opened, nor was any alchohal or anythign removed from the mini bar... HECK, i havnt even seen inside the mini bar.  

long story short. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET CHARGES FOR STUFF YOU DID NOT USE!!!

They are very deceitful and dishonest when it comes to the room rates and promotions.   After my experience with them, I felt like I had been involved in a classic bait and switch scam.  

I received a promotional e-mail for room rates of $139 night.  The promotion included a room plus two buffet tickets per day for two days. The promotion specifically stated that I could book up to 4 rooms with this rate.  Since I was coming to Vegas with family, this seemed like a great deal. 

I called and made a reservation over the phone.  I asked many questions to confirm the promotional rate and was told that including taxes and fees, the total would come to $155.68 per night.  We were coming in the off season and in the middle of the week.  There were other hotels on the strip with cheaper rates, but considering this is a very nice hotel, and the rates included the buffet tickets, we decided to book here.   We booked two rooms, which would have included a total of 8 buffet tickets.  (the buffet tickets are +25\/per person) 

On our way to Vegas, I called the hotel to confirm what time the lunch buffet started since we would be arriving around 11.  I was told at that time that my room did not come with buffet tickets.  I spoke to two different representatives in reservations who told me that my room did not include the buffet. I asked to speak to a manager, and she insisted that I must have ""misunderstood the promotion.""  I was confident that I did not, because I had looked into other hotels to compare all of the rates and had taken a lot of notes from my conversation with the Encore reservation personnel.  Instead of being reasonable and working with me, the manager continued to tell me that I was incorrect.   Finally, she said she would have to review the phone call of when I called and reserved the room.   

After 30 minutes, she called me back and said that she listened to the tape of my reservation phone call and confirmed (as I had said) that the woman I booked the reservation with did in fact say that the buffet tickets would come with the rooms.  The manager told me that as a ""showing of good faith"" they would give me the buffet tickets.    I don't see how that is a showing of good faith -- it was what they had promised! 

Upon check out, I noticed we had been charged an additional $35 'resort fee' per night.   I asked about this, because I was specifically told that $155.68 included all taxes and fees.  The woman (another one) told me that the ""resort fee"" just gets charged at the end, which is why they did not tell me about it up front when I booked the room.  I find this to be completely dishonest, especially in light of the fact that I specifically asked when I booked the room to be given a total figure for the room rates.  

The hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms were great.  However, I had such a poor experience with the staff, all the way to the management level, that I cannot in good faith recommend this hotel to anybody.",1,0,0

Between the King Resort Suite, the pools, the casino, and the service, I don't think I could ever stay anywhere else in Vegas. Everything was beyond my expectations. Not to mention that I'm a non-smoker and for Vegas, good air-filtration is so important to me. At the Encore, it never felt like a stuffy nicotine infused place like some other casinos and hotels do. 

However, the only down-side I'd say they need to work on is all the pervs with the cameras at the European pools. I know that security tries to enforce their rules against this, but over the weekend there were way too many people with their phones and cameras out who were told to put them away but who knows how many photos they got before then. Gross. 

Overall, I absolutely love this place and can't wait to go back!",1,2,1

However it fell short to meet expectations it set for itself for being a five star resort. First thing... If you're young they do not treat you as well as they do with their older clientele. Or at least in my experience that is what happened. I have stayed in many hotels and I do consider myself a hotel connessuer... For the price I paid it wasn't five star service. Also I have asked for hot water for coffee, tea, and for noodles (I'm Asian). We had to pay for a hot water kettle ( I guess that's fine but other five star wouldn't nickel and dime like that)...and on top of paying for it ,the water in the kettle have us a horrible nauseating feeling... It was so bad I had to go clubbing sober..... Because I didn't want to puke noodles all over the club. So if you wish to has a five star vacation in Vegas. Stay at city center. Stay at Cosmo, stay at mandarin oriental.  If you want to go to Wynn and encore. Just come for the high end dining and overpriced clubs. In my opinion... The type of people that pay to stay at encore aren't looking for quality but paying for the flash that they are staying at encore.  So disappointed. Rooms were clean and architecturally it was beautiful... However to be a five star you need to treat all guest regardless of age, gender, race, creed as if they are VIPs... Because money is money.  With that said I give this hotel a 3 star despite it's claim of being a five star. Another pseudo five star resort in Las Vegas.",4,0,0

The suite was huge and super comfortable.  The bathroom made me feel like I was a billionaire.  We got a sweet deal online that came with tickets to La Reve and free buffet and between that I actually spent more time than I should admit in the room.

My gentleman companion and I had big plans to go out and do stuff and somehow we ended up unable to get out of the ridiculously comfy bed.  Our Saturday night in Vegas involved infomercials and Shawhank Redemption.  Shut up, we were on vacation.  

Also, they were so vegan-friendly it was almost a step beyond.  More like vegan-curious.  All the restaurants had vegan options and even room service could be vegan!  And we're not talking steamed veggies vegan, we're talking amazing burger and fries and wtf chocolate vegan shake!!!  I was planning to cheat a little bit on my vegan ways but had so many great options I didn't even care I was sticking to my diet on vacation.

The Wynn is better known, and I'm quite sure more popular, but the Encore was probably just as good with a little more bang for your buck.

Wir waren auf der Durchreise von LA zu einem Inlandsflug für 3 Nächte im Encore. 

Was bei einer Buchung bedacht werden muss ist, dass das Encore das letzte ""größere"" Hotel am Strip ist und der Weg bis zum Beispiel zu der Brunnenshow oder der Vergnügungsmeile etwas weiter ist. Meistens aber kann der Weg durch klimatisierte andere Casinos zurück gelegt werden. Vorteil ist, durch diese Lage natürlich relativ wenig Durchgangsverkehr im Hotel, zusätzlich müssen an den Aufzügen die Zimmerkarten vorgezeigt werden.

Parken ist am Encore kostenlos, entweder per Valet oder einfach ""zwei Meter"" weiter im kostenlosen und riesigen Parkhaus möglich. Das Parkhaus ist mit Aufzügen direkt in die Lobby verbunden.

Das Hotel ist schick mit schweren Teppichen und einem angenehmen Design ausgestattet. Währen sich das Wynn Schwester-Hotel optisch eher an klassischen US Hotels wie dem Cesar's Palace oder Bellagio ausrichtet. Gefällt mir die Farbgebung und Einrichtung im Encore deutlich besser (siehe auch meine Fotos).

Der Checkin verlief Problemlos, freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Garantie auf der Kreditkarte (fast 200$ pro Tag), wie bei einem Mietwagen scheint üblich zu sein, hatte mich aber schon bei der Buchung verwundert. Die Zimmerkarten sind auch gleich Bonuskarten für die ""einarmigen Banditen"" im Hotel.

Zimmer mit ""Strip View"" sehen primär das Wynn Hotel und danach den Rest vom Strip, trotzdem ist die Aussicht auf die Stadt, Hotels und Casinos richtig schön! Ruhiger sollen die Zimmer zur ""Strip abgewandten"" Seite sein, da gerade am Wochenende die Hotel Nightclubs und Beachblubs wohl ordentlich lärm machen. Wir hatten ein Zimmer auf einem sehr hohen Stockwerk und haben nichts davon mitbekommen. Die beiden Wynn Hotels sind mit die höchsten und garantieren eine gute Aussicht.

Die Zimmer sind riesig und hochwertig ausgestattet. Die Badezimmer mit Dusche, Wanne, abgetrennter Toilette und 2 Waschbecken war mit Mamor ausgestattet und super super sauber! Der Hauptraum ist in Schlaf und Wohnzimmer durch einen Absatz optisch getrennt, der Fernseher auf dem Schrank lässt sich drehen. Der Blick von der Couch und dem Bett aus hatte ich ja bereits erwähnt. 

Die Minibar berechnet automatisch beim Anheben der Objekte automatisch. Bei ca. 8$ für eine Cola muss jede Handbewegung gut durchdacht werden. Generell waren die Preise für Essen und Getränke im Encore aus meiner Sicht zu teuer. Das Hotel bietet diverse Restaurants in unterschiedlich hohen Preisniveaus und Themen. Die Qualität ist zwar immer gehoben und sehr gut, allerdings sagen die 8$ für eine Cola schon fast alles. Die für Vegas moderaten Zimmerpreise werden hier nicht mehr nur über das Casino aufgefangen.

Das Deli im Hotel bietet häufig gleiche oder ähnliche Speisen wie die Restaurants auch zum Mitnehmen. Wir haben es genossen einfach vom Sofa aus auf die Stadt zu schauen und dort zu essen.

Pool und Spa haben wir leider nicht geschafft zu testen.

Alles in allem ein Hotel mit angenehmer Klientel, sauberen sehr großen Zimmern, in einem sehr professionell geführten Umfeld.",2,1,1

My most recent visit was at the Encore - I liked that the rooms are more spacious (bedroom with separate sitting area), and overall the hotel is quieter - you don't have to walk all the way through a smoky casino to get to the guest elevators. The pool is also a bit smaller and quieter compared to the Wynn's - I could actually find some shade without having to ""rent"" it as you do at the Wynn! 

There are fantastic restaurants and clubs throughout the resort, attentive staff, walking distance to Fashion Show Mall, etc.

Why not 5 Stars? I really feel that a 5-Star resort should not charge you daily resort and Internet usage fees - this should be incorporated into the price of your room when paying $200+ a night.  

My other comments for improvement: I was staying here for a company retreat. Most people arrived on Thursday morning\/early afternoon, and our first event started at 4pm. Given the number of attendees, I felt that as a courtesy to our company the hotel should have ensured our rooms were ready first. The event also included a formal gala, and the staff did not seem equipped to have my gown steamed, nor were the willing to extend themselves to help me out. Thankfully I was able to take it to Nordstrom across the street - they had it done in less than an hour...and for free since I purchased it from them!",1,0,0

From check in, we were greeted with the most hospitable staff.  We stayed on the 37th floor which offered a fantastic view of the strip.  The room was comfortable and the bed even more so.  I was so happy with our stay that if it was not for the upcoming work week, I most likely would have requested another night or so.  I was in search of something that may need improvement and only found one: we had 2 bathrobes which we took advantage of.  I thought it was absolutely soft and smooth while my husband DISLIKED (and I mean disliked it).  Which made me wonder what planet he was from?

The manager very unapologetically and matter-of-factly informed us it was for spa use ONLY and it could not be converted to dining.  He acknowledged that this had been the case in the past but is no longer this way.   So sad I really loved this resort until today.

This was our second stay at the Encore and I must say it was almost better the second time around.   Wonderful top notch experience from start to finish.  About a month before our visit I called the hotel to ask if they remembered the room we stayed in last year which they did and I requested if we could have the same room on our upcoming visit.  The request was noted in our reservation and accomodated upon check in.  Room was amazing just like last time with the world's most comfortable bed overlooking the strip and also the pool.  After a quick and pleasant check in we went up to our room changed into our bathing suits and headed down to the pool for drinks at the bar.  Energetic bar with friendly and knowledgable bartenders.  Crowded pool but lots of chairs and very helpful pool attendants assisted with finding an available spot.    Love the pool areas, very clean and vibrant with lots of space and trees  Feels like an oasis, you would never know you are in the desert.  The rooms are just gorgeous.  Floor to ceiling windows, request a strip view for an amazing view at night.  Room colors are warm cream and chocolate.  The bathroom is huge with marble floorings and walls with glass enclosed separate shower, large bath tub and separate toilet closet. Luxurious robes to wear with large soft towels and upscale toiletries.  The bed linens are heavenly soft.  They are so comfortable and are available for sale in the hotel store downstairs.

I booked a hair appointment at the salon which went very well.  A little on the pricey side to put in my hair extension and style my hair ($154) but I must say she did a fantastic job!  Exactly what I wanted and my hair looked great.  The salon features all Kerastase and Shu Uemera products.  The spa where the salon is located looks amazing.    We had dinner that evening at Lakeside Grill.  Pretty good, prompt service and a nice view overlooking the lake (duh...Lakeside) but we felt it was a little too much for what we ordered. 

We had breakfast and lunch at Society Cafe which doesn't disappoint.  Great food and really nice restaurant.  We also had breakfast at Terrace Point Grill at the Wynn which was also very good.

The casino at the Encore is beautiful but a bit more quiet than the casino at the Wynn.  Gorgeous red chandeliers and exquisite tiles and flowers everywhere.  One thing we noticed while walking through the casino as compared to other hotel casinos is the absence of cigarette smell.  I don't know what they do to control the odor but they do a great job.  

They have several of the very popular clubs on property.  We went to Blush on this trip and XS last year.   Different size clubs but very similar experience.  Crowded and no seating except if you purchase bottle service which on this trip was $600 minimum.  That's ok if you have a group but for just 2 people that's a little extreme to sit down.  We did get to meet Holly Madison though which was cool.  

Overall, we had another fabulous experience.  Cannot recommend the Encore enough.  Every employee we encountered was very professional and friendly.  Very upscale hotel with impeccable service.  We visited the MGM, Planet Hollywood and The Palms.  These hotels don't even compare.  I have stayed at the Venetian once before but after a tour last year it appears to be going a little downhill especially since they installed a HUGE green neon sign, makes it look like a Holiday Inn. 

Tip, bring your essentials i.e. sunscreen, cigarettes, cigars, etc. they charge double even triple at the hotel.  There is also a $20 per day resort fee.   

We spent some time at the Wynn and want to stay there next year. The Wynn seems to be a little more lively.  Would love to compare.",1,0,0

Our original room was 2 queen beds, strip view, on the 19th floor (1924). The front desk agent had warned us that the nightclub might keep us awake if we were light sleepers. We didn't think it would be a problem and took the room anyway. Room 1924, the room we were given, is the room closest to the elevator.

Even though it was a non-smoking floor the room smelled funny. My friend and I couldn't decide if it was a smoke smell or a burnt toast smell, but either way, not good.

The room size for 2Q layout is the same as the 1K layout with the exception of the dividing wall. So essentially, all the furniture in the 2Q room is pushed up against one wall. There is a huge open space on the TV side of the room. I feel like the Queen room is a definite step down from the King room. It's almost like they knew they needed it, but didn't want to spend one second thinking about it. Go for the King room if at all possible.

The view from the 19th floor wasn't that great. All I remember was the lights of the McDonald's sign.

Because of the smell and everything else, we decided to wait for the bellman and move to the 15th floor. Our room, #1547 was at the end of the hallway, just down from the requisite ice machine. We never heard or saw anyone use the ice machine, so our proximity wasn't an issue.

Our new view was the ""mountain view."" Just a few more hotels and a big church. Not too bad though. I didn't feel like we missed out on the view at all. Our room didn't smell which was more important to us.
Other people have mentioned the sensor-based accounting system for the fridge. You can pick an item up to look at it, but after 60 seconds you'll be charged for it. No big deal if you know about it. Our check-in guy was really good and told us about it.

Our room, although on the other side of the building, did have some noise. We heard the people from the floor above or below us through the ventilation system. It wasn't really loud, just tinny sounding.
Next to the right side of the bed is the controller for the lights and drapes. There are small icons on each side of the button, so while you can just push the button, you may not get the desired outcome. For instance, if you're going to open the blinds, look for the button that looks like the open elevator door button. This is REALLY important for the lights. One wrong push of the button and your partner will be rudely awakened. The All Off button is really nice, when you go to bed, but pushing this button and then walking to the door can be hazardous to your health!

If you're looking for plugs to recharge your phone, plug in the computer, etc. There aren't many. On at least one lamp there is a plug on the base of the bed-side lamps. The only other easily accessible plug is near the desk.  We had to move the sofa to get to the plug behind it. Strangely, there is a fax machine in the room.  

The bathrooms are great, just like other luxury hotels in Vegas. The lighting is great! Some other hotels are too dark, this one was just right!  It even had a night light!

Housekeeping was varied. On one hand, they were great. We called down for a lint roller and they were packaged so nicely when they were delivered we had to call and see if we were charged for them!  When they were delivered, we were out, so they left them on the bar. Afterwards, they called to make sure they were satisfactory. On the other hand, we used the iron and left it on the floor near the windows. They never put it away, which leads me to believe they never went to that side of the room. It sat there for 3 days, until we put it away.

Now for the public areas: Overall the Encore is more modern than the Wynn. The primarily red color scheme is bright and cheery. The colorful butterflies are Asian inspired and not child-like at all. In short, inviting while still being elegant. 

The casino is nice, of course. It's not smoky, like other hotels. Minimums are higher than some places - what else would you expect?

Thursday night we got in late and ate at Stratta (see my review for that).

We ate at the buffet Sunday morning (I'll do a fully review at some point), but it was just good, not great. It had an amazing array of desserts.

The sundries store is great and has most of what you need. I specifically needed things to keep me from continually stepping out of my shoes. They have those! I needed hair mousse - they had that too, but only in a gigantic bottle - they did have hair gel in a small bottle though. My only issue was that none of the sodas had a price on them.

If you're staying in the hotel you get VIP access to the nightclubs - and the lines get really really long. I can't imagine any club that is that important to get into!

Checkout lines get a bit long. Either grab yourself a champagne at the lobby bar, like I did, or do the express checkout!",3,1,1

As soon as you arrive to this beautiful hotel, you feel like you're in a different world.  The decor is lush and magical, the people are the friendliest you will ever meet, and the amenities are exceptional.  

Encore's customer service is the FINEST amongst all the hotels I have ever stayed at in Vegas or anywhere for that matter.  From the housekeeping to management and everywhere in between, every single person I encountered was polite, professional, and helpful.  They were completely genuine and never snooty, which most would expect at a high end hotel.  

The restaurants, shopping, and night life were all incredible.  I checked out their club XS and WOW!  Absolutely amazing!  I can see why this club was voted BEST in the world.  And after that I stopped by one of the restaurants here for a late night meal and ordered the XS Burger!  You have to try this burger: A huge burger piled high with fried eggs, bacon, cheese, and french fries.  I've never seen anything like it and it was incredible!

I can't say enough about how much I love this hotel, but I do know that this is the ONLY hotel I will ever stay in whenever I visit Vegas... With the exception of Wynn (same company).

last year I was staying at one of the encore suites with my girlfriend and one of the nights when we got back to the room I found a big cockroach in our bath tub which scared the living crap out of my GF since she has phobia to them! I got the whole incident on tape, killed the damn thing and took it to the front desk to complain and at first we were offered late checkout! After speaking to Ruben Vivas who is the hotel manager and being offered an UPGRADE on our next stay I decided to just dispute the charges. At checkout we were given one night off of the bill which I told them I don't agree with but they took it off anyways knowing that I won't be able to dispute the charges by them doing that. I tried several times disputing the charges on my credit card since my trip was ruined but since they credited that one night Amex says they did give you credit for that night so you can't dispute the charges.

Cons: Long waits for buckets of ice (couldn't get yourself), fully stocked mini-fridge preventing you from stocking youself
Location: This hotel is close to downtown, but far from the middle of the strip. However, it's great if you're looking to stay someplace quiet on the strip.

I'm not someone who generally stays at five-star hotels or who travels to glamorous places around the world, so I can't make those kinds of comparisons. However, I can say that I had a fantastic time staying here for our honeymoon. We stayed in the king suite in the Tower Suites section. The room was a little smaller than I'd hoped, but it was very clean and glamorous, and best of all, quiet! The linens were exquisitely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the overall feel of the room was comfortable. Our package included a complimentary breakfast (I only paid a $9 service charge for all 5 breakfasts) and the breakfasts were large and delicious! The Tower Suites also feature a private entrance which means no long treks to your room and no long wait time for cabs. The staff was also very attentive and friendly. We felt like royalty staying here. It's not the cheapest room on the strip, but with no resort fees and such a beautiful atmosphere, I can't imagine staying anywhere else for our honeymoon!",0,0,1

The suite was really nice and spacious with a separate shower and tub, and a TV in the restroom which made it nice to not miss the Oscars while I was showering :)  The casino was very clean, nice and spacious and airy (not suffocating cigarette smells) with lots of selections for fun slot machines (my favorites are Wheel of Fortune and Monopoly!).  Got a view of the northern part of the strip facing Circus Circus which isn't that great of a view but you get really large windows with lots of light coming into the room.  

You are not as close to the action in the center of the strip but I didn't really mind since you were able to walk through the Wynn and the Venetian pretty much indoors most of the time.  I think overall I would definitely come back and stay here or at the Wynn because the buffet is AWESOME!  Probably one of the best I've had - we opted to do the breakfast buffet and it was $20\/pp.  Not only was there a wide selection (which included a huge dessert bar where you can even make your own ice cream sandwiches) but the quality was up to par which is something you normally don't expect of a buffet.

Seriously, it was!  My husband and I stayed for three nights at the Encore in mid-October to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary.  We were initially delighted by all aspects of the hotel, and were raving to friends and family about it for the first two days but, ultimately, it was a tremendous disappointment due to our last night being completely spoiled by noise resulting from our close proximity to the hotel's nightclub, Surrender (we were on the seventh floor, corner suite, room 701).  This noise, in the form of continuously booming techno dance music, was so loud that it was drowning out the television and making it impossible to relax, and was very annoying to say the least, particularly when you're trying to go to bed and get a good nights sleep in preparation for departure and various obligations the next day.  

What really upset me was that there had been absolutely NO mention of the noise issue created by this club when we booked the room, nor at check in, so we had absolutely no warning or knowledge of it until the problem occurred on the last night of our stay.  We stayed from Monday through Thursday, and evidently the nightclub is closed Monday and Tuesday nights, opening on Wednesday night and staying open through the weekend, so I guess we were lucky that the club noise wasn't an issue right from the beginning of our stay.  Apparently, according to the manager I spoke with later that night, we were definitely supposed to be informed of the room's proximity to the nightclub at the time of check-in, and given the opportunity at that time to accept or decline the room but, despite the presence of four idle check-in agents when we arrived, no one said a word about the nightclub noise, and we were blissfully unaware of it until 10 pm on our last night when, as I say, our pleasant stay quickly turned into a nightmare from which we could not extricate ourselves until the next morning. 

When the music first began, we tried to just make the best of it, assuming it would be temporary and stop at a reasonable hour but, at about 11:45 pm, when it became apparent that the music was going to continue indefinitely, I called down to the front desk to inquire about when the club might be wrapping things up for the night, expecting to hear maybe midnight to 2 am or something, but the clerk rather matter of factly informed me that the music would be playing loudly until 4 am!!!  Needless to say, I was flabbergasted and asked to speak to a manager, who offered us only earplugs as a solution!  I politely informed her that not only was that not going to solve the problem for the simple reason that the noise was too loud to be muffled by earplugs, but that this situation was totally unacceptable because we were paying $2000 a night for an unbelievably noisy room with no advance warning of the noise!!  I also informed her that we would never have knowingly booked any room affected by noise of any kind, much less a room costing that much per night, as we are extremely noise sensitive and I was also in need of rest due to my imminent departure the next morning and my having to attend several important and costly appointments over the course of the next two days.  She offered to move us then and there at midnight to a smaller room on the other side of the hotel, to which I replied that I needed rest and was not going to spend hours trying to pack up and move to another room at that late hour, because that would be nearly as disruptive as the music was.  

Finally, I gave up trying to get any resolution with this manager and politely stated that her solutions were entirely unacceptable and that I would be filing a formal complaint in the morning with Wynn Resorts.  Then after a few minutes I received an unsolicited call from another more senior manager who was extremely nice, took full responsibility for the problem and again offered to move us to another room.  I told her the same thing I had told the previous manager, i.e., that moving would be a lengthy process and therefore prevent me from resting.   Finally she offered to comp the night, which I told her I very much appreciated, but unfortunately it did not solve my problem of needing to rest.  And so in the end, my husband and I had to try to get whatever sleep we could until 4 am with that awful music blaring and waking us up frequently over the course of the several hours, which was a miserable experience that left us exhausted the next morning.

If only I had checked Trip Advisor, as I customarily do before every trip, to check for issues of this nature, I would have never booked this hotel, because there are a multitude of reviews complaining about the noise at both the Wynn and Encore, and many of them even mention that it continues to 4, 4:30 or even 5 am and is hard to get away from even on high floors!!

It's saying something when I've stayed at the Wynn and used the same high praise to describe the Wynn only to have the Encore shatter all expectations and make me feel, if only for a couple of days, like a big baller shot-caller extraordinaire. 

The staff is truly helpful during check-in to help you maximize your stay. TIP: For an extra $20 you can have them upgrade the view of your room to a strip view which I'd recommend is the way to go.

It's amazing and the perfect way to go if you're staying in Vegas. It's ""perfmazing"" (yeah, I made up a word to describe the how sweet it is) and I think the true testament to the resort is that when you plunk onto the bed, you're tempted to stay in the room for all it's glorious comfort. 

My buddy visited our room and described it as ""a work of art"" and even though he was a little drunk, he hit the nail on the head.  

The last two times I've come to Vegas and stayed at the Wynn and Encore and it was all beautiful and really the most pleasant experiences I've had to date. They really do cater to you like no other. Take, for example, when I won a free buffet for two and the person working the Red Card desk gave me a line pass to go along with it or when the room is turned down and they arrange all my toiletries neatly for me. Talk about 5-star customer service.

I've been to the Spa and used their gym facilities before and it is worth every bit of the $35 for a day pass. Then again, I just like lounging in a bathrobe. 

This time, I was able to check out both the Wynn and Encore pools and they are amazing. The European pool was not as happening as advertised but Camellia C. was able to alert me of some fake boobs out on display and so it was definitely an event. Still, it just adds to the fun you'll have lounging at the pool. 

I've had nothing but great memories staying at the Encore with the my previous visit being one of the best times of my life. You might find yourself staying up until 5am just wandering around and admiring this place and then grabbing a bite to eat at Zooza Crackers only to find that you're still as energetic as ever. 

My recent visit was again top-notch and was a true 5-star resort experience and was something I could definitely get used to. 

So if you like being doted on or living in the lap of luxury then this is the resort for you. It's spoiled me to the point where I'm not sure I want to stay at other resorts. Instead, I feel like coming back for an ""Encore."" Okay, ignore the cheesiness and trust me when I say that you'll have a fantastic time here too.",9,8,8

who the HELL is steve wynn, and WHY THE FUCK is he so fabulous? man, even his voice is slick as hell, deep, sonorous, and coaxing is his voice playing from speakers of his very own slot machines. wynn explaining the dining and shopping options. the features and benefits of the wide array of amenities and facilities. his voiceover tour of wynn macau... for someone who isn't physically there, he takes every effort to personalize your visit. he makes you feel like that girl who doesn't usually give it up on the first date, but as the night draws to a close, you're willing to make an exception... 

this is absolutely the best experience i've ever had in regards to vegas accommodations-- the textures, color, details, and overall layout of the suites are genius. a swiveling 42"" plasma tv bisects the 700 sq. ft space so you can watch your wynn network tv while relaxing at the desk or on the sofa\/chaise with the stunning view of the strip behind you. good luck getting out of bed- the sheets are amazing egyptian umpteen thousand thread count, the mattress cradles you like a wee child, the ambient lighting and plush carpet are both modern and inviting. and... dare i say?... and the suites have one long wall that's completely mirrored. repeat: that means even there is a mirror next to your bed. aka that means more fun for you. ;P

highlights:
- youngish crowd. if you like thehotel at mandalay, you'd love encore.
- whimsical colors and texture. a designer's treat. +1 for extra plush hallway carpet so you don't hear people walking past your suite door.
- esplanade connects to wynn lv and features awesome stores like rock & republic, wynn & co. (jewelry), manolo blahnik, etc.
- 24-hour room service with special breakfast packages (eg traditional chinese breakfast included congee, pork sung, scallions, century duck egg, shu mai (i sub'd for char siu bao), and black tea.)
- society cafe gourmet sliders, sweet potato fries, and bellinis were tasty and the decor was awesome, but the value wasn't there for me.
- eastside lounge is amazing and open very late. favorite: the definitive pear ginger martini. tip: ladies, ask the bartender for xs, tryst, and blush VIP passes here. they usually keep them behind the bar. 
- the pool and gardens are breathtaking. be sure to have your red card ready to show, as it is only limited to hotel guests.
- encore wynn is insanely techy-tricked out: do not disturb signs are replaced with new paneled LED lights outside your door. heated marble floors during the night. remote controlled sheer\/drapes\/lighting. pressure sensitive mini bar that automatically bills you for an item if that item is lifted for more than 60 seconds. a weight scale in the bathroom. a tv in the bathroom. separate deep soaking tub and glass standing shower, also with seating and handheld nozzle.

simply amazing, from arrival to departure. the encore is up and running smoothly after 1 month of opening. SPECTACULAR!!",4,5,4

I personally have a soft spot in my heart for the Wynn and Encore because that's where my husband and I got married 5 years ago. It's an amazing hotel full of beautiful details and service. Lately, however, I feel like the standards have come down a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's still beautiful, but the rooms are a bit in disrepair. 

Upon checking in, I noticed the the lamp and tables were a bit dusty. The bathroom light was broken and hanging from the ceiling. The XS club was so loud I couldn't sleep on the 14th floor. We asked to be moved, but unless we wanted to ""upgrade"" it didn't seem they would be accommodating. 

One day the maid came and cleaned half our room. We walked in and saw the bathroom was clean but the bed was unmade and the rest of the room was still messy. She showed up an hour later and said she was on lunch, but came to finish. 

The Internet was AWFUL. I mean terrible reception. Unfortunately they don't offer free wifi like most hotels either which is disappointing considering how spotty the reception is. The Wynn was very smoky unfortunately. Not the usual.  Encore was better as far as the air quality.

I'm also a huge fan of the private tower suite check in-because it's quiet, smells nice, and the elevators to your room are right there!! You don't have to haul your bags far or across a casino.

If we'd have been out till the wee hours, like we usually are, it probably wouldn't have bothered us.

Restaurants were good-we ate at Wazazu, the Buffet at Wynn, and Cafe Society. All were good, and I'd go back again.

The European pool is rad-we got a cabana and it was beautiful.  It's so nice not to have kids running around-drinks are good, and we could order room service to the cabana.

I didn't play here at all, just walked over to Wynn to play. Mostly be cause there's more of a crowd and a funner (is that a word?) vibe at the Wynn. I would definitely stay here though.

Below are more details but in summary,  it was a real good experience overall, however, the check in process was a complete cluster f@#$! So heads up!!! 

Mr. Wynn, if you get this review I'm sure some heads will roll, as I am shocked on how such a successful business had an utterly chaotic check in process. Whoever designed this process must of been smoking something. 

Arrived pre-check in ~ 1pm on a Friday. Way to beat the rush right? Wrong! Stood in line ~30 mins, We were ""Pre"" checked in around 1:30 pm. We were told we would get a text when the room is ready. Big smile from reception person, no further details provided.

Got a text around 2:45 pm, "" your room is ready"" come pick up your keys. Went to get the keys and the line was 45 -60 mins long. I asked the host standing, we are pre-checked in, can we get our keys? He said sorry sir, you have to stand in line! I said again?!?! What about VIP line, you already have my CC etc. he was useless. A suit doing nothing. I piped up and called the desk, while standing 6 ft away, I know ridiculous right! Sooo after complaining they said we will send them to your room in 15 mins and gave me my room number. So up I go, waited 30 mins. No keys yet, it's now 4 pm. I call again, they say come down to pick them up, I said I am not standing in line. So I go down and finally the Suit standing there let's me in the VIP line, got the damn keys and I'm in. 

Talk about first impressions! Encore failed miserably at this! So here is a question, why let me do a pre check in to start? The standing in line multiple times is a such a waste of time. Opportunity for a six sigma process!

Anyhow moving on...I Booked a 2 Bed Room with stunning views, 61st floor! Contacted the concierge, booked tickets for Tryst, VIP line. Also reserved dinner at Lakeside. Great concierge service!

Night 1 was Tryst, had a blast, $18 cocktails, great music, fun crowd. Night 2 was at XS DJ Kaskade rocked the house! Fun crowd again, partied all night! Such a blast!

Saved the best for last, what's a summer Vegas trip without a beach party! Encore Beach with DJ Kaskade again. Long line to get in ~ 45 mins.. $80 cover,,,but was worth it. Stayed from 1:30 till 6. Met people from all over the world, lots of fun, very very crowded! 

Will come back again!",6,0,2

They knocked and came in multiple times which got me irritated because I wasn't able to enjoy the late checkout I PAID FOR (with the DoNotDisturb light on). I would imagine they have a schedule or should ask the front desk before barging in to ask multiple times our time of departure. I thought it was  very rude and unwelcoming.

The cafe doesn't open until 6am and we had an early flight to catch. I was directed to the East Bar which was packed with drunk 20-something smokers. Really off-putting--some of Encore's guests *are* grown-ups. The hotel itself is gorgeous (aside from the smoke) and our room was really nice (aside from a torn duvet cover and a lack of outlets in useful places.)

We had several meals here and one big plus is that my allergies were easily handled--with absolutely no hesitation or trouble. Dinner at Red 8 was fantastic. Breakfast at Society Cafe was meh (the omelet was dry--overcooked and maybe had been sitting?) but the way my allergies were handled was impressive. 

I was fully prepared to only stay at Encore any time I'm in Vegas but after this morning, I'm not entirely certain I'll be back. While I don't need to find the Senior Center just yet, I would rather stay in a hotel that caters to adults, not the club crowd.",1,1,1

They lost my luggage the first night when I left it with the bell boy, checking out was a nightmare, ordering food and having basic things in the room (like a pen) proved too difficult... but I must say they redeemed themselves this year.
I stayed in the tower suites this time around for CES and would highly recommend it. The suite is huge... 2 bathrooms, a massage room, living room, bedroom... way more space than I needed. The staff were very sweet, the concierge was great with reservations and checking out was very easy. The separate entrance is key if you don;t have a limo because it makes getting a cab much easier (and you avoid the ludicrous lines that exist at the main casino entrance) and check out is much faster. 
The gym fee is a little ridiculous but that's just standard Vegas so it's not specific to Wynn\/Encore.  
Last thing -  one day the maid threw out bags that I had left in the middle of my bathroom... she thought they were trash. Except they contained the shoe bags and receipts from several pairs of beautiful new shoes I had bought. She threw them out by accident. Obviously I was pissed... but they were very professional dealing with it and went back the store and sent up 5 sets of Louboutin and Sergio Rossi covers after they realized what had happened (and who am I kidding... I wasn't going to return the things :) Throwing out the bags - not cool - but the way they dealt with it was very professional and very much appreciated.

The king sized bed was plush and so comfortable it reminded me of mine at home.  The bed faced the window yet there was a half wall that separated the bed from the sitting area so it almost felt like it was two rooms.  My favorite part was the control panel next to the bed, one push can turn off or on all the lights or lights to specific areas of the room, and also closes and opens the curtains..you never even have to get out of bed!! the bath room was also huge.  the toilet was in its own separate room which is important for ""the business.""  there was a big tub, and also a shower for those that like to stand.

1. The beds are uncomfortable (worn and needing replacement). The climate control is pitiful for a hotel of this caliber. First, it is basically an upgraded wall unit similar to what you'd find in a cheap motel. Second, It was hot as heck in my room (and my friends next door room) even with the setting on 60 degrees. I got practically zero sleep in four days.

2. Not a lot of action on the gaming floor. This place is dead! Much better at the Wynn side but still not a happening crowd.

3. Other than the fine dining options, the cafe, etc. are all pretty terrible. Room service is better than all of the non-fine dining options (but you'll pay $32 + tax and tip for an American breakfast).

4. Las Vegas has a municipal code that restricts glass on the strip from 6pm New Years Eve until 6 am New Years Day. This is for safety reasons and completely understandable. However, the Wynn and Encore enforce this as no glass sales from 6am until 6am. ""You can order a bottle from room service"" was their suggestion. Yes, at a 500% markup. I printed the memo from Las Vegas Metro PD and confirmed it with the PD on the phone. Manager would not budge. I walked next door and purchased 3 bottles of champagne for very reasonable prices. I don't mind high prices but I don't like to feel cheated. Obviously the Wynn does this to sell more $20 glasses of champagne. 

5. Wifi service is horrible - slow and unreliable.

Plenty of room for closet space for your party wear..long couch with a great view of the strip.. ( even though the windows felt kind of wobbly that it scared me )  Unfortunately, my friends and I wanted the linked suites but we weren't able to get that.  Our doors were still right next to each other though so that was cool.  

I especially enjoyed the poolside.. Great pool areas.. Plenty of pool chairs.. even though i say plenty.. you still have to get your hawk eyes ready to find a spot since the hotel is packed with buff men and sexy women walking around their swimwear!  We got a few drinks by the poolside.. 2 drinks for a total of $30.. That is typical vegas prices so I wasn't surprised!

The views could have been better but it really doesn't matter when you have floor to ceiling windows....awesome views of everything!

Encore is all about the little details that make your trip perfect. For example, putting your name on your room key and making it also your players card. ""oh now I feel special and appreciated and it's that much easier for me to gamble. Thanks!""

Another plus-- the whole place is decorated in that big, over-the-top Las Vegas way we all love. gardens in the main lobby, five bajillion mirrors in the hallways so you can check yourself out, and art all over the place. Even when you're lost looking for the elevators back to your room you'll stay entertained just by looking at the walls.

Also, the towels were rather rough, and so was the toilet paper they had. When I travel, I want to feel pampered, and when the towels, showerhead and toilet paper are better quality at home, I do not feel pampered. The red color inside both hotels really got to me this time. The dark red colors felt too heavy and gaudy. They really need to get a better designer in there to revamp the colors and decor.

So, we wanted a classy, escapist setting that would allow us to do just that - escape!

We arrived and were offered the option to upgrade our 19th floor king suites to 59th floor king suites - we said, yes, please:)  We had the north strip view of Circus Circus, etc...which wasn't that great.  However, the views of the environs, such as the hills and beyond were lovely.  As a bonus on a busy weekend, these suites were quieter than the ones that faced the south strip.  I'd heard that XS could be heard until the wee hours of the morning, so we hoped to avoid that by going to the 59th floor facing north.  This was a great move, as we heard nothing, nada, zilch the entire stay. 

Once we explored our suite, we changed at went to dinner.  Sinatra was just off the elevator and we were pleased to be seated promptly for our 8pm reservation.  I will review Sinatra separately, however, our experience there was overall very positive.

After dinner, we walked around the casino, and decided to gamble elsewhere, as you don't want to learn a new table game or two with $25\/$50 minimums:(

After a late night out, we called it a night and retired to our gorgeous suite!  Yet, we awoke about 3 hours later because the room was so darn hot!  I love a cool room to sleep in, but my husband requires it.  He is so hot (pun intended) that he needs a darn good air conditioner!  This one wasn't up to the task. I cranked it as low as it would go - 60 and full fan.  Finally we went back to sleep once it was a little cooler in there.

Morning came - and we ventured downstairs to Society Cafe.  A bit of a wait at 11am, but not too bad.  A great breakfast there!  The Apple Pie Sticky Bun was divine, as were the Eggs Benedict.  The breakfast potatoes were OK.  Coffee was wonderful - and we were even able to take a cup to go.

We explored the Wynn a bit - window shopped - picked up Le Reve tickets - etc...we met our friends for lunch.  As they were already waiting at Society Cafe, we met them for lunch.  Lunch was even better than breakfast!  The Wagyu Pastrami was so delicious that I was wished we hadn't split it - I wanted it all for myself.  However, the sweet potato fries kept me happy for a while as well.

We went shopping at Wynn, did some gambling, stopped for a gelato at Sugar and Ice, people watched, etc...before we went up for a nap.  The room was perfectly cool (thank goodness!) so we napped, took a bath in the fabulous tub and then dressed for a night out.

Dinner was at SW Steakhouse at Wynn.  We were really bummed that the patio was closed due to weather - as we booked this restaurant for the water view\/show.  However, our disappointment vanished once the food started arriving.  Such an indulgent experience!  Truffles everywhere - wine was flowing - desserts came on trees, etc...We're glad we booked an early reservation as it took a leisurely 2 hours and 45 minutes. 

After dinner, we had another cocktail at Parasol Down while we watched the water show.  It was a nice treat to see, but I don't think it is worth making a special trip for.  

We went to the Wynn theater for Le Reve - as I've seen every Cirque show in Las Vegas, I pretty much knew what to expect.  However, I loved the theater in the round seating that the Wynn has.  And, contrary to some Cirque shows, Le Reve was very easy to follow as the storyline was clear.  A great show.

After Le Reve, we went for cocktails at Botero.  This is just down the hall from XS - so I thought it was going to busier than it was - but there were just a handful of tables there.  We all tried cocktails off the specialty menu - some were hits, and some were misses.  We all agreed that the Paloma cocktail was the best of the bunch!  

Another late night - leading to another restful stay in our suite.  The bed was quite nice - firmer than I am used to, but delightful linens helped me adapt:)  

Alas, it was time to leave the next morning - but I had to take another dip in the tub.  Fantastic!

Things that we might have changed:
The bedroom and living room should be flipped.  The living room was much cooler than the bedroom.  it should be the opposite.  Plus, the view should be from the bed, we thinks!
The light\/shades controls should have two locations.  If you're in the living area, you should be able to control things without having to go the bedroom.

Overall, we loved our stay at Encore.  Both couples loved having most anything we wanted within the complex, without having to find other diversions.  For couples looking to relax and indulge - it definitely hit the spot.  I also loved the fact that the inclusions that came with our package were automatically removed from the bill.  We didn't have to double check - ask a manager - quibble or grovel.  Our show tickets and dining credits were attended to as if by magic!  

Great stay!",2,0,0

The service was impeccable throughout the 3 days we were there and we had a great time.  The pools are great, the dealers are fun, and overall the hotel was on its game.  I only have one regret and that was eating at the Wynn's Alex Restaurant for their tasting menu.  Don't get me wrong, the meal was great, but the bill for 2 for dinner was $700 before tip, which in my opinion is far too much.  I would say that it was worth $400 at best.

Pros: 
1. It was a beautiful hotel with a lot of reds and butterflies. The room just looked as modern as you could imagine. The room was large and clean. Even the bathroom had a TV in it. :) One interesting part was that all the food\/water provided in the room were placed on some sort of sensor: if the item was lifted for more than 60 seconds then you would be charged. 

2. Since the hotel's newer than the others in the strip or they had better air conditioning, the casino in the lobby did not smell as bad as other hotels if you know what I meant. i personally value this a lot coz I physically would feel terrible if the casino smell's bad.

3. Encore is connected with Wynn and they have a lot of amazing restaurants and bars to try!

Cons:
1. I originally ordered a king-bed room on non-smoking floor but when we checked in, we were told the only king-bed room left was on a smoking floor. I did not want to risk it so I ended up with a double queen beds room. As we were told, the hotel room was not guaranteed even though we already paid for it. :(

2. Well, so I ended up with the double queen beds room, and unfortunately, the TV in the room was broken. I called the front desk around 10 pm to get it fixed, but after 30 minutes, I was told that they had a lot of requests and could not come to my room to fix it soon. Ok, I accepted the fact that I had to wait until the next day. BUT, around 2:45 am when I was asleep, the front desk called and asked if they could come over to fix TV! Come on, it's 2:45am! Did I really sleep so much earlier than the others!? Anyway, after that, they didn't call anymore and the TV remained broken until I left the hotel.",1,0,0

You see, at the Encore you'll notice the quality they keep and the cultivated beauty that radiates throughout the entire property. Modern decor, check! Simple yet elegant furnishings, check! And to top that off, the service was excellent! Talk. About. Service. When in Vegas why not feel like a princess? Or Prince? Simple pleasures from the bell hop who took our luggage up to our room, the taxi ushers who made hailing a cab quick and painless and for our ever so clean and well kept rooms thanks to our daily cleaning ladies. Our few days here at the Encore were definitely worthwhile. When you want to feel ultimate splendor, check into the Encore!

Steve Wynn nails it again with Encore!

I was excited to hear we would be staying at Encore for two nights paid for by my cousin. Heh It still lives up to it's 5 star elegance and is better than Bellagio in my opinion. But really, you can't compare Bellagio and Encore because they are two different resorts with different themes. Encore was chosen mainly because it is set far away from the rowdiness that is ""Sin City"" and into it's own niche in the northern part of the strip. The Encore is an all suite tower with an option to upgrade to the larger suites or with the panoramic view. Luckily for us we were upgraded to the panoramic view on the 56th floor for free because we my cousin knew one of the front desk clerks. 

As you can tell through the details of the well appointed casino like the colorful butterflies on the mosaic floor and on the ceiling, his idea for the Encore\/Wynn theme was ""Natural Beauty."" It shows throughout the complex the big expensive windows overlooking the gardens and the warm colorful tones of the property and the many waterfalls outside of the property make you feel secluded from the rest of the strip. Aside from the hotel \/ casino, the clientele is very attractive and healthy compared to the ones who patron the low end hotels. 

Staff here are top notch and live up to the Wynn standard of service. I didn't get to try the pool because we were always in and out of the hotel. You are allowed to use the Wynn pool which is just a 5 minute walk from Encore. Outside of the complex, I wouldn't walk north at night because the neighborhood is shady and a lot of panhandlers and sketchy people populate north of Encore. If you're looking to save some money from Encore's fancy restaurants, there is a Denny's just outside of Encore and a food court in the Fashion Show Mall right across the street.   

The casino is not as smokey as the other casinos with it's strong ventilation systems and fancy scent they pump into the air system. I will admit I did win some money playing at Wynn because the slots at Encore are tight. They always send great deals when you gamble a few $$$ in their casino. Encore has swoon me over and I will definitely come back if I receive a good deal. Kudos to Encore!",10,4,6

The suite was wonderful and very roomy. The tub was nice and oversized. Our issues started right away. One of the glasses in the bathroom had lipstick around the rim, the shelf under the sink clearly is a spot the maids frequently skip over, the ice bucket was full of water telling me that it had not been cleaned out when I called down to the front desk they seemed pretty apathetic but fixed the problems.
When we checked in it was notable that the front desk was cold and unwelcoming.  We came to Vegas to relax and hang out by the pool so most days we were pretty casual. We always dressed in acceptable dress code yet whenever we went into the stores they seemed snooty.  It was really annoying. The store keepers were so uppity it wasn't enjoyable shopping there.
If you are going to Vegas to hang out at the pool the Wynn\/Encore is not the place. There are 3 pools. The pool at the Wynn is the largest but it doesn't get any deeper than ~3 feet . It was so shallow that it really wasn't even fun. The two pools at the Encore are also really shallow and are so small that I was surprised. For as upscale and showy as the Wynn\/Encore presents itself they should be embarrassed to sport what appears to be the two smallest pools on the strip.
Overall I would say that the pros and cons balance each other out giving the Encore only average marks.",2,4,1

We are in our early 30's, married for almost 8 years - so we prefer a more relaxed atmosphere, nice restaurants, good wine, no crazy parties needed... 

I have to say the Venetian remains my fave still. The rooms at the Encore are smaller than at the Venetian, they have only one TV in the room that turns (which keeps turning even after you try adjusting it to the right angle). I dont know what they were thinking with mixing the brass\/golden colors and the silverish stuff, looked tacky. 

The Bathroom is smaller than at the Venetian (no table where I could sit and do my makeup), otherwise it's almost identical to the Venetian bathroom's layout. The robes were onesize, so my hubby did not appreciate that, being a slim 6'4'' guy...The bathroom scale needed new batteries, I guess no one checks that? 
The remote control stuff, was nice (not like you can't close the curtains at the Venetian with a remote as well). Be careful though and not turn on the Housekeeping button at the entry door by accident like I did - they show up later :))) ooopss... 

Housekeeping - they did a good job, never once caught them there by accident so they seem quick. The only complaint I had was that they pretty much let us have the same shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion for 4 days!?? For a 5 star place they should've replaced them more frequently. I finally threw a small amount of the body lotion out so that she'd get the hint that I need more...as I was showering at least 2x a day, and my skin was super dry from the Vegas dryness I wanted to be sure I had enough for the last day and next morning there. 

The Pool...nice (agree with being a tad small), but over crowded with the lounge chairs, you are literally lying there next to another person. I prefer a few inches of distance from strangers. At the Venetian I recall a bit more spaciousness. If you are there for a weekend\/holiday, either go out early (like by 10am) to grab some chairs to leave your stuff on (not just the towel) or be prepared to tip the poolboys who interestingly enough went through and kept putting the towels a certain way so THEY'd know which one is available. It got a bit crazy. 

The waitresses at the pool were nice although one of them was a tad blind the first day I was there because it took me over 1 hour to finally order a drink. I'm a lady and I dont feel the need to yell, so I kept trying to politely wave, but nothing. Even my hubby couldnt get her later on when he joined me. Finally he went to the desk area and asked what it takes to get service :). They quickly sent a 'different' girl over to take out order, but then the girl servicing our actual area shows up with the drinks 'looking' for us, asking a bunch of other people if they ordered the stuff...it was hilarious! She still couldnt find us, mind you, we were 2nd row of lounge-chairs in only, waving at her like crazy at this point...After that finally others got to order in our corner area as well. The following few days I had no problems (did change areas though too). 
On Friday at 11am I tried to go to the European Pool area so I could get a better tan, but it was too crowded for my taste so just stayed at the main pool instead. 

The Encore, is all about spending money. EVERYTHING will cost you. But it's Vega$ so it's to be expected. Just to get to the pool, you pretty much go through a store, so weird. 

We found it a tad annoying (as we hate crowds) on Friday and Saturday nite as we are trying to get to our room, you had to wade through a pool of people waiting to go to XS. Lines everywhere ($30 for ladies, $100 for men, are they kidding? I'd hate to be in my 20's and go to Vegas, I dont know how anyone can afford that never mind the drinks later) 

Restaurants - we only had breakfast at the hotel, at the Society cafe. That was nice, pricey, but excellent breakfast. Don't bother with the cafe right by the elevators, those pastries were aweful. The only thing edible is coffee and yoghurt parfait. 
Pizza Place at the Wynn - lowkey, good for a beer and some pizza type food, sit on the balcony for sure. 

Be sure to check your final bill before leaving the hotel. We have some $4 charge that we only noticed at the airport and have no clue on where it came from or what it is. But..am I really going to make a big deal and ask them what it is? No. Hopefully it's not their way of scamming the last pennies out of people. 

Overall, I just have a 'been there done that' feeling for this hotel. No need to go back, unless all other 5* hotels start sucking in Vegas too.",5,2,1

I have stayed at Bellagio and that place was just as beautiful. I always thought that staying at MGM Grand I was seeing the best Las Vegas had to offer, was I ever wrong.

The valet is $18 a day and you can come and go as often as you like, they will bill your account at the end of your exit. Staff at the valet were excellent, greatting and asking if we had any questions, valet in Las Vegas is always great because they show they have customer service but these guys were wonderful.

The check in to me seemed a bit long even though there was about 7 women working the counter and assisting people checking in but they showed at least for some no communication skills. I didn't check in personally since my name was not priority but I would have been eager to get a room key and go on my way.

Once you walk inside the casino, reception and the elevators you see the detail the management takes to feel fancy, staff were attentive such as their security officers and their maid service.

The room was simply beautiful and I'm sure it was the basic or maybe the upgraded room because it had a living room against the large windows facing the west strip. The bed was magnificent, they had a huge television and many channels to watch.

The bathroom was huge with his and hers sinks, separate toilet, small hot tub for one and a shower. They provide everything you will need in your stay. Robes, shampoos, lotions and towels both small and large.

I was very comfortable in this place. They have a small screen next to the bed that controls your lights, the curtains and the Do Not Disturb option. Each room has a door bell, now that is freaking fancy.

If you have the funds to stay here then do yourself a favor and do it.

This used to be a top notch resort\/casino destination, but lately it seems to be falling down rapidly. Maybe due to a lack of management?

No expense was sparred, no corners were cut they went beyond and above making sure they every detail was meticulously done.

What a beautiful property! The whole entire hotel\/casino had gorgeous custom carpeting throughout and chandeliers that were the size of a large SUV! Simply gorgeous!

Our room..well 'rooms'. First off, they put us in a room that overlooked Ross Dress 4 Less and Circus Circus.. way to welcome the honeymooners Encore!! 
By day 2, I had to ask for a change because I'll be god damned if I'm going to spend my entire vacation looking at that drab scene!
We got a new room with a better view and all was right with the world...even though this one looked over Trump Tower *gags* But, it definitely was a step up from Circus Circus & Ross.

We watched Steve Wynn's welcome video to his hotel\/casino and entertainment about 130,000 times.. it was our background noise whenever we were in the room. It started to become part of us and we still refer back to some of Steve's words from time to time. I think we became memorized by his voice..he's one smooth operator that Steve! 

Having been to Vegas in Summer 2015 and staying at the Venetian, that was all I had to compare this hotel to and they're pretty comparable in terms of what they have to offer.. tho, really, I liked the Venetian better. But, that's because the Venetian has more to do within it than Encore\/Wynn. I like having more to do at my fingertips.

We never won much while playing at Encore, but whoo wee did we drink too much!

We stayed here just 1 night for a quick weekend getaway and had a great experience. The Tower King Suite on the 56th floor was very spacious large suite with lots of mirrors so it felt even bigger.  
http:\/\/www.wynnlasvegas.com\/Rooms\/EncoreTowerSuites\/TowerKingSuite
We loved the super comfy bed and tons of pillows. The couch\/chaise in the suite was comfy and the automated curtains were gorgeous. The bathroom was very nice with great linens (super soft!), nice robes to use, adjustable pressure on the shower, dual sinks, a lighted makeup mirror and everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. I didn't get to try the tub, but hopefully next time. We had a pool view to the Wynn and it was really nice. While checking in, the desk clerk warned us about the bass sound from the clubs at night and offered to put us on the other side of the tower if we wanted. I didn't think the bass was too bad since my husband & I are both heavy sleepers, but if you are a light sleeper you might want to request the opposite side of the tower. No indulging in the mini bar-- there are lots of notes saying that anything you pick up for more than 60 seconds will be charged to the room. We took advantage of late checkout at 1pm. 

The rooms also had a Do Not Disturb button you could turn on so that the maid service won't disturb your room. Love the free Wifi-- why don't all hotels have this? In staying on the 56th floor, the elevators were great except the fact that my ears popped every time we went up or down? WTF? I would then spend a few minutes opening my mouth & dropping my jaw to make the popping stop and then looked like a moron I'm sure. Oh well!

The decor of the hotel was classy overall. Lots of red with flowers and butterflies in jewel tones. The red and purple is really nice together and there was some great art throughout the whole property. 

Blackjack table was fun and the cocktail waitresses had nice uniforms, especially compared to some of the other hotels. It was really funny to see a 5+ month pregnant belly of one of the cocktail waitresses and she was still in the same little dress as the other ones!

POOL:
Pretty mellow at the main pool on the Sunday we were there. It was probably because Lil John was at the Encore Beach Club that day. After determining it would cost $97 just for my husband and I to get in, we determined that we didn't want to spend that much. We wandered over to the European Pool and it's ""21 and over -- No Cameras"" sign. I didn't realize that meant topless... Ha! It wasn't *that* private, so only a few ladies were actually topless. The ""toptional"" pool at the Mandalay Bay has more security out making sure that no one is taking pictures of the topless ladies. The cocktail waitress we had was a bit slow, so we only ended up having one cocktail each. My favorite poolside drink is a Lava Flow-- strawberry daiquiri mixed with a piña colada. YUMMY! It was a good time, but I wouldn't head to Encore just for their pool.

The hotel is immaculate and such a great luxurious experience. Hopefully my husband will treat me to it again!",3,0,2

I went here on a weekend getaway.  The Encore had been trying to get me to come for the last two years.  The deal was awesome.  Two nights on a weekend, two free buffets, and two tickets to La Reve.  Here is the issue.  The hotel charges you for everything and asks you to make sure it comes off your bill during checkout. They charge for free tickets, they charge for Internet access even though they force a resort fee on you so it should be included.  They even charge a daily additional fee to your credit card of 150 per day which one week later has not been credited back to my card.  When I made my reservation I was given a complimentary upgrade as were my friends who came with me using my same deal.  However I was told I didn't have that upgrade and  my friends did and while they would like tomhelp they were full. The front desk staff has no authority but the front desk manager refused to interact.  Then when I insisted he told me he listened to my reservation request and I was not guaranteed anything.  During my interactions I saw two other people who had to fight for simple reversals of charges on their bill.  BEWARE OF ANYTHING YOU CHARGE.  THE ENCORE TREATS YOU AS IF YOU ARE STEALING AND PUT THE BURDEN ON YOU TO PROVE OTHERWISE.  The apathy  and indifference they have for people at the front desk  is the worst I have ever experienced and it seem as if it is a normal occurrence.  There are a lot of all suites hotels to choose from  in Las Vegas even some without resort charges still. Find another one unless you are staying for free and that might not be a bargain.",0,1,0

The all suite hotel delivers unparalleled service and amenities that any true connoisseur would be proud of. My first experience with Encore began with a Rolls Royce ride from the airport.

his ride was not only a metaphor for the grandeur I was about to experience, but was also the perfect way to keep me in the ample luxury that I am used to.

Upon entering Encore you are quickly inundated with beautifully colored mosaic butterflies along every pathway and the liberal use of rouge in the carpet and exquisite chandeliers. Natural sunlight brings warmth and energy to the gaming floor, while flowers and plants leave wafts of their wonderful aromas dangling in the air. Every detail, from wallpaper to door handles has been carefully scrutinized for perfection by interior designer Roger Thomas and it shows. The intimate feel of Encore lends cache to every activity that you can do.

Unlike other places in Las Vegas, Encore is not overburdened with tourists and the common gentry.

The suites at Encore only further enhance the wonderful experience. With automatic drapes, glass enclosed showers, and flat panel televisions, it is hard to leave your room for anything else! The view from my room looked out upon the Las Vegas strip and all its glitz and glamour. As I write this entry I can only wish that I was back in my suite, getting ready for some gambling. Better yet, I wish I was at the spa.

Located on the second floor of Encore, the spa features 37 treatment rooms, 14 naturally-lit garden rooms and four oversized couples' suites for massage, body treatments and facials. Then there are two movement studios offering spinning, yoga, pilates, conditioning and meditation classes as part of the new Fitness Center. With such a vast array of services in a tranquil atmosphere the spa will definitely make you forget your bad luck at the blackjack table.

Encore is definitely the place to stay in Las Vegas if only the finest will do! Keep checking back, as I will go into more details of the fine and not so fine restaurants and nightclubs at Encore. Now if only I can only come up with reason to ask Steve to let me come back again.",0,0,0

The basic double queen rooms are very spacious and you can comfortably sleep 6 people (2 on couches).  We got a room with a view of XS pool\/club which was nice.  The only problem was that we were on the 5th floor so that we were barely able to see anything!  The advantage is that you never have to wait long for an elevator!

I used their gym facilities on a Saturday morning and it was pretty packed.  Every cardio machine was in use and the guy working the front said it will be busy all day on Saturdays.  All of the cardio machines had personal TV monitors.  They had towels, water bottles and free headphones available for your workout.  A fancy 24 Hour Fitness right in the hotel!

The only problem I have with this hotel is that the casino floor feels like a maze!  I always have a hard time navigating through the floor sober or not.  I had the most interesting time trying out make my way out of the casino to Palazzo this last weekend while intoxicated.

Massive rooms, super clean, excellent service, slightly less trashy clientele than elsewhere on the strip.  Of course, a cup of coffee will cost you an arm and a leg, but I suppose that's to be expected.  Seriously, though, don't come thinking you'll just buy a sunscreen at the sundries store.  The cheapest bottle starts at $34. 

While I like the pools at Encore, I wasn't blown away.  There's a main pool that's small-ish and kid-friendly, and there's the adults-only European (read: optional topless) pool that's larger with a swim-up bar.  It's fine, but I've been to better pools in Vegas - namely, the pool at Palazzo, which I think is leaps and bounds bigger\/better\/nicer.  Encore's Euro pool has a ton of tree coverage, for obvious reasons, but the trees get in the way of my tanning dreams.

Beyond the pool issue, the restaurants are great, the dealers are friendly and the views from the upgraded suites are magnificent.

I rated it three stars because I was basically forced to stay here in order to purchase Garth Brooks tickets which is probably by design, of which I have no problem. I recognize Encore is an upper scale hotel which isn't my style so maybe I'm discredited as a reviewer and that's fine. I'm mostly sharing my experience because maybe other's will feel the same way. I'm sure all these 5 star reviews are valid if you have no budget limitations and you like to spend time in your room, two things that definitely don't apply to me. 

So yeah, I have to say, the bed was awesome, the staff was courteous, the TV was great, the staff new my name every time I called a service, and all that stuff was top notch, but for $350 and an additional $20\/day resort fee for free internet (which I was almost charged $14 for connecting when I tried to with my smart phone anyway because no one gave me a username\/pass to access) and printing my boarding pass is a bit much when I just want to see Garth Brooks and play craps. The table minimums were never less than $10 which is too pricey for my blood when it comes to craps. 

If you don't get a strip view, you'll be looking toward the Stratasphere and a bunch of unfinished\/halted construction, a Ross's Dress for Less, and the indoor skydiving place. The Mall across the street is awesome with a discount show tickets store and a really nice Skechers store.

The buffet was $88 for 2 for dinner and $68 for 2 for lunch. This is pricey, but man, the food was off the chart. The dinner included crab legs that were pre-cut in half making them almost no work to get to the good stuff. Pricey buffet but well worth it if you love to stuff your face like I do. The Pecan pie was awesome...shrimp was great...several selections.

Overall, I have mixed reviews for this hotel. I understand there's lots of overhead and the price is the price and they gotta make money or they'll go out of business, but the truth be told, I'm not the kind of guy to enjoy or take advantage of the amenities that come with staying in a hotel this nice.

The bathroom had a mystery stain on the counter that looked like old toothpaste. Ok, no problem we called housekeeping and got it taken care of.
We went to the casino and ordered drinks at the bar. We paid for them and it was no issue. We then went to an empty card table, and I proceeded to gamble while she stood behind me. Everything was fine until she sat down next to me at the table. She was asked for her ID and she presented her temporary ID from Missouri (she lost her ID yesterday and had to order a new one). We were told that it wasn't valid and could not be accepted and had to leave the casino. We then went back to the same bar from earlier and ordered drinks. This time we were carded and refused service because of her temporary Missouri drivers license and couldn't get drinks at the bar. Meanwhile she was still holding the drink that she ordered at the same bar earlier and was allowed to leave with the drink. I understand that the hotel deals with a lot of fake IDs, but a government issued ID that allows you to board and airplane should be enough to get a drink and watch someone gamble in the casino.

It was just past 7am and neither my daughter or wife could get back to sleep so I decide to call the front desk to find out when the pool opens.

On our way to the pool we happen to go by the concierge who encourages us to tell management about the previous incident(s).  We go to the front desk and Laura (the morning manager) becomes argumentative and tells us several times that ""different customers have different expectations and some don't want to be contacted.""  The point of our conversation was lost on this person and we decided to just continue to the pool.

The room itself was very spacious and well laid out.  They charge $10 for buffet line passes which is probably necessary only on holidays.

This was after the fact that I confirmed the room early that morning with 2 beds.

1 King does not work when you have 4 girls and they said they were fully booked.
SO then they said they would provide those roll-away beds.
Every time we called they said it would be there in 15 mins...and we called a bunch (8 times!).
So instead of wasting our time and waiting for the beds, we went out.

We come back at 3am and NO ROLLAWAY BEDS! WTH!
So after complaining they offered us $50 resort credit to compensate us....uh...no! Our problem will not go away for $50! 
How can $50 resort credit help the fact that we don't have a bed to sleep on?

We kept going on and on until 4:30am. Then a miracle happens, they said a room was available with 2 beds!!! at 4:30AM!

The food is delicious and worth every penny. I bought my own alcohol at Walgreens to save money, and also some snacks.

A huge reason we decided to try this hotel out is that I am vegan so the fact that Steve Wynn is vegan and has a vegan menu at every restaurant made my life so much easier! I didn't have to search for a place for me to eat every day like I have done at other hotels. And the selections are delicious and taste so healthy compared to other hotels.

Also, the clubs and beach parties are better here, so that makes it easy to go to XS or encore beach club and walk up to your hotel after! So much easier than taking taxis to clubs every day or night. Yes, it is further down the strip, so walking to Planet Hollywood can be a pain, but it is only a 20 minute walk, and you can go through the venetian and palazzo so it's actually a fun walk, but the clubs are better at Encore anyway! 

There is even a shopping hallway that leads straight to the Wynn without having to go outside, so you are basically paying to stay in two gorgeous hotels with twice as many food options, two pools, and multiple clubs to choose from day to night. 

The fitness center is fantastic with water and fresh  fruit set out every day. They even have workout classes! I saw the marvelous spa but didn't want to pay the steep prices so I have no review on those services. 

Last year, after two days, we were ready to leave Vegas. This year, we stayed 4 nights and didn't want to leave! Would recommend staying here and I will be staying here again next year for sure.",1,0,1

Upon arrival I was very impressed with the design of the Encore.  The lobby is very luxurious and you certainly feel you're mingling with the upper crust of society.  The guy checking me in was really nice, however, he kept asking me if 'anyone else' was going to be coming up to the room and should he leave a key for my room for 'any evening guests.'  I think he brought it up four different ways which I kept trying to make it clear that no, I had no plans of anything kinky and that I would be the only one using the room for the duration of my stay.  Felt very awkward after the third time.

Got up to my room and it was probably just a standard suite.  It was nice, but I think the Venitian feels more luxurious.  It felt pretty cold compared to the warmth of the lobby.  Very neutral and not really anything cozy about it.  The bathroom has a really nice layout.  Didn't like the door to the shower, but love the seperated toilet.  The mattress was comfortable but didn't like the pillows.  Living area was pretty much a window with a nice view of the rest of the strip.  

Biggest beef with the hotel is that after dinner, I thought I'd go relax abit in the hot tub and came down to find out that the pool closed at 8:00 PM.  What?  Is that really their hours or was it just because I was there in April? I couldn't tell.

I booked at the Encore trusting that it would be a nice, modern, chic place to stay, and it definitely turned out to be! I am in love with the decor here.. all the bright colors that pop out, and lavish designs that come with it!

Other reasons why I love this place:

-the parking garage is very close to the rooms, and there is a digital sign indicating the # of spaces left. Useful!
-NOT OVERCROWDED! you can actually get in and out of the hotel in a snap!
-XS Nightclub.. duh!
-beautiful pool area, although I never got to make my way down :\
-beds are amazingly comfortable.. plus the down blanket that makes you feel like you're sleeping in a cloud
-everything is VERY new and updated. They have a control center where all the lights\/drapes\/privacy signs are at a push of a button :)
-Huge window which opens up the room a lot more
-Wynn resorts have all-access hotel keys that you can use to charge anything to the room and gamble with for rewards points.. plus it's personalized!

The ONLY problem we had here was waiting in line at the front desk (twice behind one guest ahead of us) for seriously 20 minutes just to activate our room key (we moved from a king to a double queen) or to ask for an extra room key. How can it take people 25 min to check in??

My husband and I drove our 2-month-old brand new car (it is my first brand new car ever) from California to Vegas for our wedding. Before we left, we went to a dealership for a routine car wash and everything looked perfect. 

The trip to Encore was smooth and fine. We arrived around 10pm and gave our car to the valet parking in front of the lobby and then checked in.

We stayed in Encore for 4 days. After our celebration of wedding and a happy stay in Vegas, we claimed our vehicle and drove back to California ---- we should have taken detail pictures of the vehicle before and after we left it to Encore. Unfortunately, we did  NOT: only because we trusted Encore and thought they would take a good care of the parking.

After another smooth trip back to home, we drove to the dealership again for a car wash. Surprisedly, a deep, serious, approximately four inch long scratch is on the rim of the right front wheel! The dealership said only a very strong hit to the right curve could cause this damage. We were so shocked as we have never ever been involved in ""hitting a curve"" issue.

I contacted Encore immediately and followed their procedure by submitting a detail report with pictures. Today I got their response:""We are so sorry that you did not realize the damage that has been there before you arrived Encore. It is not our responsibility.""

I then insisted to see their camera photos proving that they are ""not responsible"", but they said ""Sorry we cannot disclose it to you. Your insurance agent is the only association that we can provide those photos to.""

You know what? According to the dealership, the total cost to fix this damage is around $150. If it is not Encore's fault, my husband and I would never ever spend hours and hours on phone calls, paperwork and emails (and then ended up with a response ""Sorry but it is not our fault. Maybe you did not realize when the damage happened"") just for that amount. Yes we are both students. Yes we are not that rich. BUT WE ARE HONEST PEOPLE AND ARE ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING. Unfortunately, it seems that Encore has nothing like that.

And yes we did not have any ""direct proof"". Because the only thing we have, as most customers, is our trust on your hotel.

This is my first, and definitely the last experience with Encore and Wynn. And a lesson we learned: Take pictures of EVERY DETAIL before and after we leave our vehicle to any third parties.",5,7,3

The Encore tower has a more contemporary design, with a nice touch of casual elegance. The floor to ceiling windows are awesome.  I like the large work desk here but I like the dining table setup at the Venetian much better.  The floor plan here is ok, but again I like Venetian's sunken seating\/dining area a lot more.

The Wynn\/Encore complex has a lot of ""red"" and bright colors, which really doesn't appeal to me. It also has a lot of Asian and Asian fusion restaurants and the Asian theme is so over-whelming that it becomes excessive.  Even the soap and shampoo in your bathroom are scented with BAMBU desserts.  While I do like the lemongrass shampoo, I don't need Asian dessert smell in my bathroom.  

I do like the Encore better for its compactness which requires a lot less walking from the valet parking to the room elevators.  The casino area is also more compact and more easily accessible from different areas of the complex.  I like the Encore side casino more because it is less crowded than the Wynn side.  It's good if you are there to gamble and not for the party atmosphere.

The Wynn\/Encore Red Card program is very generous in terms of comps if you bet enough $$$.  We pretty much had most of our meals comp'd during our 2-night stay there.  And this, I like a lot more than Venetian's Grazie program.

Service has been excellent from everyone we have encountered, except for the valet when we arrived.  After I have unloaded my luggage and stepped out of my car, the valet wanted me to move my car forward.  A good valet at a 5 star hotel would have walked the 10 - 20 steps and moved my car himself.  But I guess this is just one isolated case.

Overall, a solid 4-star experience and I will definitely consider staying at the Encore again on my next trip to Las Vegas.",44,21,33

And it's how Encore's front desk handled all of this that makes even less sense:  Instead of righting the situation, they only offered apologies.

Prior to the reservation, I contacted the manager of the valet, whom subsequently identified himself as ""Phil."" He told me that upon my arrival, I had his permission to park my motorcycle inside the valet garage. After driving approximately 600 miles, I arrived at the resort and was told that I could not park my motorcycle inside the garage. After approximately 20 minutes, a valet attendant finally believed that I had previously obtained Phil's permission to park inside the garage. Almost immediately after parking my motorcycle inside the almost empty garage, Phil emerged from an elevator. In my presence, the valet advised Phil that my motorcycle was parked inside the garage. Phil immediately denied giving me permission to park inside the garage. After I had an approximately 5 to 10 minute conversation with Phil, he relented and I was able to keep my motorcycle inside the garage. During my conversation with Phil, I had to beg him for permission, which I already obtained. During the reservation process, I asked the employee if she would articulate on the reservation that my reservation is contingent upon my ability to park my motorcycle inside the garage. I also told her to document that Phil had already given me his permission. She told me that she did include my request on the reservation. Therefore, if she did her job there is a history that can be obtained. It is obvious to me that Phil neglected to document the permission he provided me. He also failed to notify his staff. The fact that I had to convince Phil he previously granted me his permission, is extremely irritating. In addition, upon my arrival I was tired, hungry, thirsty, dirty and had to use the restroom, however I was required to beg Phil for his permission. I understand the reason Phil needs to project authority over subordinate employees, but to do so with a guest of the resort is inexcusable. Consequently the attitude he exhibited towards me was as if he is royalty. Because there were several other guests of the hotel inside the garage when I had the conversation with Phil, it was a very demeaning experience. Maybe the Encore does not truly care about transgressions, but with social media, a plethora of professionals riding motorcycles, maybe they should. Although my experience did not ruin the stay, it convinced me to not only take my future business elsewhere, but to use social media and inform prospective guests that the Wynn properties are not hospitable to motorcyclists. On a side note, the Platinum Hotel is very motorcycle friendly and I recommend it to  other motorcycle enthusiasts. The  accommodations are similar as well.",1,0,0

From the reception area, to the door men, the Fitness area to the spa, the pool area, the buffet & even the shops!  They are very professional & to the point.  I also must say, the housekeepers are truly sweet, they need some credit too. :)  Truly nothing bad I can find, awesome experience every visit.",0,0,0

One minor problem on my last visit, though - we asked for nonsmoking rooms but were given smoking rooms.  They were sold out and couldn't move us, and they didn't seem willing to do much else :(",1,0,0

The Blackjack tables only pay 6 to 5 odds for a Blackjack. The Craps tables only have 2 X odds on all numbers. Come on Steve Wynn at least offer 3, 4, 5 X odds. It's impossible to win any real money in the casino. You have to go elsewhere to any number of casinos that will offer much better odds. The rooms are very nice but are ridiculously expensive and the so called strip view is laughable. We had dinner at 3 of the restaurants, SW Steakhouse, Wing Lei and Sinatra's. All were extremely expensive although the food was decent but not even close in comparison to New York City restaurants. The wine list was extensive but even the lower end wines were between $60 and $100 per bottle . The restaurants are not worth the money. There are so many other resorts in Vegas to choose from, I would only choose Encore if somehow you get a bargain rate and you don't gamble.",0,0,0

Only Mandarin Oriental would be on par.  Super lux right throughout the hotel, from the rooms to the lobby to the casino to the pool area.  Stayed here many years ago as well when it first opened and the hotel has held up very well over the years.",0,0,0
