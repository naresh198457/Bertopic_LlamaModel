Went here for brunch, told 30 minute wait, but to keep an eye on the bar as it's first come first served. After 15 minutes 2 people stood up at the bar and 2 people raced past me and took the spots. So the bar seating is a fiasco. 

Finally got a seat at bar as no table was open after 35 minutes   Already had perused the menu during the wait so ordered when was greeted. Waited 35 minutes for the hash which was good but not great. Meanwhile I was swarmed by early morning drunks ordering drinks at the bar.

We went on a Saturday around noon, so I definitely knew there would be a wait. They quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. If you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. 

I typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the IP is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. Luckily, HHGG has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.

Since I'm with child over here, I didn't order a drink, but I did sample the Orange Crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - I thought they were both great! The bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something I'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in May!

On to the food. I almost always get something with fried chicken at HHGG, so this time I went for the fried chicken benedict. The chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! They came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. Oh, and underneath, was a huge block of mashed potatoes, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! My one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. The others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). I seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. The corned beef and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and I usually hate rye bread. I thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.

Yes, there is too much food! We were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3\/4 of everything. No problem - I love leftovers!

Prices run from $8 for the waffle to $16 for the eggs benedict, which is all totally reasonable. The drinks are a little high at $14\/ea for the specialty drinks, but that's definitely in line with typical strip prices.

Only drawback was the service. While friendly, our server seemed super rushed, and the kitchen took a while to get our food out.",2,0,1

First of all, I had never heard of this place, and my mom was adament about wanting to try this place because of all the awesome reviews she'd seen here on Yelp! I'm glad she insisted on it, because this place was yummmmm-o. 
Now, let me be frank, the parking at Emperial Palace is a pain in tukhus. At least it was on the night we came. The restaurant was also a little tricky to find inside the actual casino, but once we figured out where we were going, we were good to go. 
If there is one word I can use to describe the food here: hugemongous. But that's also leaving out how delicious it is. I ordered the meatloaf with BBQ sauce, and it was DIVINE. Seriously, I wanted to buy a gallon of it and take it home despite how hard it would have been to get it through airport security. I ordered like three extra serving cups of it. The meatloaf sandwich was rich and buttery, and served with a steak knife because it was so freakin' massive. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it or take it back to our hotel, so I had to leave about 1\/2 to 2\/3 of it on my plate. Sad. 
My mom ordered the Pacer's Hash, and it smelled awesome. Our friend Tiffany, who wasn't that hungry, thought it smart to just order a couple of sides, and chose the loaded cheese and bacon mashed potatoes and a side salad. WOAH. These things could hardly be considered sides. They were both the size of an entire meal. 
So if you're looking for some delicious food at a good price, Hash House is where you'll find it. 
And, you can burn some of those calories off by gambling downstairs when you're done.

It was magnificently disappointing.  

After making my mom trudge through the crap-hole that is, the Imperial Palace, we took the middle escalator (important fact) up to HHAGG.  

There was no wait, but it was relatively late after the LOVE show.  We were both tired, hungry and not feeling well.  I ordered the grilled cheese.  It was huge and had a steak knife stuck in the middle.  The bread wasn't very grilled and the cheese wasn't melted and gooey.  But it was BIG.    

Mom wanted a BLT which is served on the lunch menu and although they serve sandwiches at dinner, the BLT isn't one of the dinner offerings so no dice.  This rule was explained by our somewhat ditsy server who said it was important to ""maintain the integrity of the original HH in order to keep the license. ""  That made us feel so much better about the lack of accommodation.    

She ordered a Cesar salad instead.  It was a huge plate of iceberg lettuce, some croutons and a giant tree of Rosemary.  Wha???

Much like the LOVE show, I didn't really ""get"" HHAGG.  

I sense the original version in San Diego is much better so skip the Vegas rendition.",0,1,0

After standing for a near 45 minutes I could feel my stomach screaming at me from the Fat Tuesday indulgence I had the night before and from the teasing stench of crispy fried goodness. The waiter warned us that the chicken and waffles are best shared because of the sheer size of the dish. 

Boy was the waiter right. Not only was this the largest chicken and waffles I have ever seen but it was also the most delicious fried greasy bird that I have ever had.

My friend and I saw how big the plates were, so we decided to split something. We went with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Thanks to our cool waiter, we also ordered a side of bacon for $3 in order to avoid the plate split charge of $2.50. 

The food was SO good! Their bacon was dee-effing-licious, as was the chicken and waffles! SO much food, even when we split a plate, we still couldn't finish it! The plate comes with two whole fried pieces of chicken breast, along with 4 Belgium waffles. Their waffles even have bacon IN them! SO damn good!!!

It's a LOT of food, I'd say split a plate with someone. Unless you're a linebacker, there's NO WAY you'll be able to finish something on your own. Their pricing isn't bad, considering how much food it is. I know their whole thing here is ""huge plates"", but lowering the price and limiting the amount they give you, would make more sense to me. I just saw too many people waste their food.

The place is simple and cool looking, and our server was very cool. I definitely recommend this place.

actually I M not Rite, while we were waiting for seating we were confused as to what the holdup was because the restaurant had empty seats. but it turns out it was maybe our fault because we never told them our whole party had arrived (though our point man claims he did).

Anyway once we sat down the excitement started to build, especially when you see other table's orders arrive. This place is designed for people that eat with their eyes.

Sadly when the food arrived, as a whole it was disappointing. I had chicken\/waffles and it was a good rendition but not the best. Other people got other things and while everything looked great on the plate, the general consensus was that the taste was lacking for everyone. Too bad.

For the vegas strip, you could pay a lot more and end up with a lot less so I'd say it was an ok experience. I'm told the other Hash Houses are better so maybe this one is just lacking.

Bathroom was borderline nonexistent, you have to go downstairs and use the casino bathrooms. I didn't have to a go go, so I didn't see it.

The chicken and biscuit were moist and flavorful, the bacon was crispy and plentiful, and the potatoes were great. I pushed aside most of the sauce on top and just went for the chicken -- sauce on the side would've probably helped control the balance better.

 I cannot imagine anyone eating this whole crazy thing. I wish there was a tasting portion so that you could just have three perfect bites, as I think that that would be more satisfying and in line with how I like to eat, but I totally get that that's not the idea here.

CRISPY SALMON- fresh salmon cornmeal friend on a wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, and red onion all trimmed with chili mayo, served with fries
The sister ordered this and I was disappointed with the way it tasted. It was bland. The salmon was overcooked and dried. I was hoping for it to retain its moisture, but sadly it was so dry and flavorless that one bite was enough for me. The fries weren't flavored nor were they crisp.

GRIDDLED FRENCH TOAST- dipped in a banana cinnamon cream with pecans and maple syrup, served with eggs and potatoes
The french toast was a bit chewy and didn't have much flavor on its own, but when eaten with the banana there was some sweetness.  The potatoes were dry and unseasoned, but liked that they didn't overcook the eggs. The cinnamon cream was my favorite part of the whole dish. It was light and creamy.

What I specifically don't like is that it is in Imperial Palace. There are no windows, give it a basement-y feel event though the place is large and bright. 

Really, i insisted that my husband and I share, but he wanted his own. Anything is enough for 2 people and if you don't have a refrigerator or microwave in your hotel you wont take this to go so just share.",7,7,8

First, let me say that this restaurant proudly represents what Vegas stands for. The food is big..Huge... And ultra...  I mean ULTRA tasty. When I draft a review, I comment on 3 areas: Food, service, and price. 

The service was decent... Above average, but not over the top. The servers we experienced were attentive and friendly. Some were rather unique looking but hey, that's Vegas. One thing I liked was that everyone we talked to acted as if they were happy and proud to work there. I like that! The atmosphere was very casual and the place was a bustling with activity. I was happy and comfortable.

The food....WOW...the food.  OK, it took me quite some time to decide what to order.  Everything on the menu looked good!  So did the plates of food I saw passing by!  I ended up ordering the fried chicken benedict...a Man vs. Food favorite.  It did not disappoint.  In one word: Unbelievable.  This place prides themselves on twisted farm food.  The portions were HUGE and the taste was outstanding!  My girl ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake.  It was the size of a medium pizza!  It tasted so good that you would need to sit down to eat it.  This is simply no joke.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try other things on the menu.  If you are in a party of 4, I would highly recommend ordering 3 totally different breakfasts and then sharing them.  This would allow you to try different things and you would in no way be short on food.  This restaurant definitely did deliver in every sense of the word.  BOOYAH!

The price was amazingly reasonable for Vegas.  It was priced similar to IHOP but with all the huge portions and pizazz of a meal you cant get just anywhere.  For the two of us it was 28 dollars with drinks!  We did order too much food though as neither of us could finish.  My taste buds wanted more but my stomach simply couldn't handle another bite!

I just love this place.  I am glad we found it and I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Las Vegas.",0,0,1

It was midnight--and before venturing forth from the warm hotel into the 40 degree temps, I tried to call ahead to make reservations or at least see how long the line was. Unfortunately, after ringing, the line went to audix voicemail--so no help there. It would have been nice to talk to anyone, because when I arrived, a host informed me the wait would be 20-25 minutes. I was the only people in line and plenty of empty tables--but the hostess said that only two servers showed up today--so they were not able to serve at a normal capacity.  

with so much distress going on for the customers and servers, it seemed unfortunate that:
1. no one picked up the phone to warn me that this would be a huge delay
2. that the hostess wasn't running around helping the servers. perhaps it's a union issue. but whatever it was, the restaurant was not functioning in a good way last night.

It sounds like a tough night--maybe a once off. But really, the next time I need a fun atmosphere, well run restaurant, or late night option, the last place I'd feel like trying is the hash house.  And that's unfortunate because it makes all the other hash restaurants look bad too.  

Next time, the Peppermill is super reliable, fun, and ---RELIABLE.  they pick up their phones and they let us know what's going on.

Portions are HUGE...so I usually order just the basic eggs, sausage, toast and then I just eat off others plates --otherwise there is a bunch of wasted food.

Our server was friendly but with an agenda. There were two items he recommended - chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken benedict. I wanted the former, so that was fine. But David, rebel that he is, wanted instead a combo of fried chicken, eggs, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuit. Our server tried hard to steer David back to the benedict - ""you have to trust me on this"". But it wasn't what he wanted, and he stood firm. Substituting sausage for bacon was not allowed. Maybe that's what happens when you wander off the recommended path. My chicken was very generous, and I loved the fried leeks on top. One piece of chicken was very good, the other had some soft and chewy bits and just didn't taste as good. The waffles were ok, but nothing special. David liked his chicken, but thought the potatoes were uninteresting and the biscuit heavy.

Sadly, I couldn't say the same this time for this location. Both the service and the food ended up being more lackluster than what I remembered it to be from the other location we visited in the past. 

We came on a Wednesday morning and it was decently busy but not too crowded; we were seated within 20 minutes for four. However, we waited for what felt like nearly another 20 minutes before our server even came to greet us for the first time when we were already ready to order and eat. Afterwards, the wait for the food also felt incredibly long which we weren't too grumpy about since they did have a lot of customers. I was just disappointed that our server was often nowhere in sight. 

The food came in huge portions which is what they're known for. I got the Texas Ranchero Benedict and tried some of my friend's Meatloaf Hash as well. Definitely preferred the hash over the benedict - note that they serve their benedicts with scrambled eggs instead of poached. I didn't really like the Texas Ranchero since it felt like there were maybe four spoonfuls of chorizo along with bits of eggs here and there. It was full of crispy fried chips more than anything. The hash was a much better mix of meat, veggies, and eggs. 

I think the food really depends on what you get, the Sage Fried Chicken options are usually pretty good and the hashes as well. I personally don't think I would get a benedict from here again if I do come back since I love poached eggs in benedicts and the scrambled eggs kind of ruined the magic for me.",0,0,0

But I used to own two restaurants which were very busy. We never let the phone ring on and on like that. Phone orders are just as important. Many restaurants have somebody dealing with just togo orders- I suggest Hash A Go Go look into such an option on busy days like Sunday morning. 

Ordering in person was easy and the food was ready within 15 minutes. They forgot to pack us forks and knives.  I had to run to a cafe in our hotel and ask them if I can have some from them. By this point, I was terribly disappointed with the whole experience, which is unfortunate because I like the food.

There was four of us girls - enjoying our girls weekend in Vegas and my girlfriend said we absolutely had to try this place... knowing about the large portions - we figured we'd share - order 3 dishes for the  4 of us!

Wow - I think we should've stuck to 2 dishes for 4 of us but actually it didn't matter because we got to try their DELICIOUS and the BEST EVER Chicken and Waffles; along with their brown sugar banana pancake and their meatloaf hash...  a ""little"" of everything! :)

First - let me tell you - the Chicken and Waffles - while HUGE was truly the BEST I've ever had... and I've had plenty...  this is by far even better than Roscoe's or our local TOWN restaurant...  the chicken was juicy, crunchy with that SAGE flavor - OMG... add that to the light fluffy waffles... you absolutely had the best of sweet and FLAVORED savory...  a MUST try dish FOR SURE!!!

The meat loaf has was EXCELLENT - lots of bits of delicious meatloaf with veggies and potatoes - but I will admit the chicken and waffles definitely was our #1 choice...

Their brown sugar banana pancake was absolutely a great way to end the meal - wish we got it at the end versus at the same time as everything because I think HOT would've been even better...  they had so much bananas in there made the inside of the pancake gooey which is more like a dessert than a traditional pancake.... so we're not complaining! :)

Because their portions are so big - so hard to try different things - so I guess we'll just have to keep coming back to try different dishes!!

OH - and our server - wish I caught his name... was a HOOT - and so patient with us as one of the girls likes her coffee HOT... so he heated up her cup and poured fresh HOT coffee each time! :)

Most people in Vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  They could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.

That to say, the food, although excessive, was AWESOME!!!  I will definitely be going back to this joint.  I got the Farmhouse Scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  Absolutely delicious.  Eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much mashed potatoes so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but I loved them just fine.  Went great with my bowl of gravy :)

Boyfriend got the french toast and he was equally pleased with his meal.

Only small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  They told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  We went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  They could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  We were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting...

We have one in Califonria, but she said that Vegas is a lot better. Well, since my coworker is so in love with this particular location, I had to try it out. My group of friends and I came on a busy summer Saturday morning around 11am. The hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. Go figure....because when we walked up the stairs (yes it is located upstairs of Harris Casino), we can see a large crowd of people, either standing or sitting. The waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. 
We waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting. So we asked the girl who took down my number if we can order something to go and she said yes and told us to order it with the bartender. So my boyfriend and I walked over to the bartender and tried to get our orders in, but no one acknowledged us....We were literally flagging down the bartenders and the waiters but they just ignored it. I understand that this place gets packed and busy, but please dayummmn rude.  About 20 minutes in, we were finally asked ""How can I help you?"" At that time, our name was called and we ended up dining in.
We ended up ordering 2 items:
1. Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! This portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. For something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! The plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, and eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. I finished a little portion and had the worst food coma I've had in a while. 
2. Of course we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  The waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! Major plus for the bacon eaters! The chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. The fried chicken was delicious, perfectly made and so moist. It wasn't all greasy like the chicken you would get from Popeyes or KFC

Everything was so delicious, and none of us finished out plates. There were 6 of us by the way. I will definitely come back, at an odd hour like 5am to avoid the wait. I hope the staffs can help us faster next time.. Its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth.",2,3,3

The pecan-banana was satisfying to my sweet tooth - in fact, it was rich enough that I realized halfway through that I hadn't even added the maple syrup provided. 

Our server was great - he offered a suggestion when we asked, and checked up on us a couple times. A manager also came by to check in on us.

the bf & i split the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. the order came with 2 BIG pieces of chicken & 4 waffles. 

the waffles had bacon INSIDE them!! as good as that was i still dont know how i feel about the bacon being inside them as i found myself picked apart the waffles just so i could have a strip of bacon. the waffle & syrup just kind of over powered the taste of the bacon & as a bacon lover i do NOT want that.
the chicken was delicious, nice & crispy & very tasty when added syrup to it.

i took of one star because of the service. Our waitress was really nice & all but i think we were there for a total of 2 maybe even 2&ahalf hours because of how long it took for them to take our oder, get our food out, bring us the check, & give us back our change. we got our food brought to us last because they said that the chicken & waffles took longer to make, which i really dont understand why because i know how to make fried chicken & it does not take an 45 mins to fry 2 pieces, even if you double fry them, which HHAGG's did not seem double fried. but other than the wait i really cant complain. i am not as impatient as some people

I was staying at the MGM which didn't have to many breakfast spots near it except for Denny's and the buffet. I then searched on Yelp for other breakfast spots in walking distance because I was tired of eating at the buffet for breakfast.  I then came across Hash House a Go Go on Yelps search results.  When I saw the name it made me think.... wait I've heard of this place before.  The reviews for this place were amazing and I did a little research to check and see where\/how I might have heard of this place.  I then came across a food blog that mentioned them being featured on Food Networks show Diners Drive-ins & Dives.  That's when I remembered where I had seen this place before.  We then took a looooooonnnnnnnnnng walk down Las Vegas blvd to the Quad hotel so that I could indulge in the goodness I remember seeing on Food Network and also the pics that were uploaded to Yelp.  When we arrived the wait didn't take that long due to it being only two of us.  I'm sure if it was 3 or more we would've had a much longer wait.  After quickly skimming through the menu I instantly knew what I wanted to order.  I asked the waiter what he would recommend and he stated that everyone comes in for the Andy's Sage Fried chicken.  We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried chicken and the corned beef house hash.  When the orders arrived I couldn't believe the amount of food they give you for the price.  I mean this was like a mountain of food for two.  My order arrived in a cast iron skillet with eggs on the bottom piled with potato hash and the house made corned beef and Swiss cheese on top with a homemade biscuit.  I then took a bite of my corned beef with Swiss cheese and man o man.  That was some of the best corned beef I've had in a long time. Everything was well seasoned and fresh straight from the farm I'll like to add. I didn't get a chance to taste the Sage fried chicken but it looked amazing. I honestly couldn't eat my entire meal.  Might I add the prices were not crazy either.  My meal was $12 and the Sage fried chicken meal was $15. After leaving I wanted to kick myself in the a$$ for not coming here earlier during my stay. I could have ate here every morning for half the price of a buffet while leaving stuffed like I ate at a buffet.  This is a perfect example of ""if you knew better you'll do better"".

We get there and there is a whole crowd of people and a 1 hour wait time. We patiently wait next to a giant plastic cow until our names are called at which point once we are seated, our waiter informs us its another 45 minutes for food. Based on all this wait time, you expect something spectacular, right? Husband ordered the chicken and waffles and I just got their buttermilk pancake since I was planning to eat his food anyway. Well the LARGE PORTIONS definitely is true. Also, they bring out the food as its ready and not all together so I got my pancake like 15 minutes before he got his food which is kind of awkward but whatever. Chicken was okay, moist and flavorful. Waffles were a disaster, some weird smell. Also, for such large portions, really only 1 small cup of syrup?? I saw multiple tables request a plate of extra syrup cups. Total bill came to $24 for two entrees and an iced tea. I'm sure this review won't discourage those who have already bought into the hype (it's okay, I was one of those) but for those who have discerning tastes, skip this place unless it's convenient for you and there is less wait time.

Breakfast of champions. If you can go to Hash House A Go Go and finish a plate by yourself, consider yourself a champion. The portions are ridiculous! Their menu entrees list the typical American breakfast foods with a little twist. Their featured item on the menu is the chicken and waffles. I had the fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash and it was plenty to share with the boyfriend. The ingredients were very fresh, and it came with a side of a biscuit, an egg, and fruit. It was good, but I still feel like I should have tried their waffle or french toast items because those looked delicious. We opted for the ""healthier"" choice that day because we weren't feeling well, so I'll definitely have to go back and try their token menu items. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't horrible, and our waiter did a good job trying to mediate the traffic.

If you want breakfast right away, this isn't the place to go. But if you're down for the wait and willing to try this famous breakfast house then I say go for it.

But I'll get to that later.  

It had been a long day of driving, with a long night of drinking still ahead of me.  I was definitely looking forward to some artery-clogging goodness.  And what better way is there to prepare for a night of drinking than stuffing some fried chicken down your gullet?  

My friend and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles, and we found that people were not exaggerating...the portions were HUGE.   I think it would have been the perfect amount for three people, but for two it was a bit much.  The waffles were delicious; they had bacon cooked right into them, and the slight chewiness and sweetness of the waffle complimented the greasy saltiness of the bacon quite well.  The chicken was good, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn't really taste the sage.  

My other friend opted for the corned beef hash, which was also huge (though not as huge as our tower of chicken & waffles).  I tried some of the corned beef, and it was rather tasty.  Honestly I can't remember much else about his dish, other than...the asparagus.

Now, none of us held any illusions about the type of food this place served.  If it wasn't deep friend, it was covered in butter and\/or salt.  Being a sucker for grease and salt, that was just fine by me.  However, we didn't expect the deep-frying madness to extend to the 2 or 3 skinny stalks of asparagus tucked in the side of the skillet.

(Deep fried asparagus and the Spanish inquisition: two things you never expect.)

Oddly enough, they weren't greasy.  Or crispy.  And oddest of all was that they tasted absolutely nothing at all like asparagus.  Actually, they didn't even really taste like food.  After thinking about it for a while, my friend declared that it tasted like overcooked toothpaste.  I believe that was a pretty accurate description.

This place isn't gourmet fare, but it does hit the spot when you want some comfort food. And how many other restaurants can claim to serve the most terrible (and bizarre) asparagus that you'll ever eat?",0,0,0

The food is so flavorful, satisfying and leaves you wanting more. Have no fear, take it home and eat some for lunch!

I fell for it. I wish I hadn't. 
I ordered the fried chicken eggs benedict. They stay true to the fat\/grease\/carbs\/bacon formula. This behemoth has a bed of grilled mashed potatoes topped with dry biscuits, layered with the slimiest, uncrispiest bacon, topped with flavorless fried chicken, then finally over-sauced with a bland chipotle cream sauce. 
As you can tell from my description. I hated this dish. That is putting it mildly. This dish has never heard of contrasting textures. This dish has one texture, which is MUSH. Everything is mushy and dry. The bacon might've been crisp before, but when sandwiched between biscuit and chicken it just got slimy. It was almost the texture of raw bacon. You want the crunch of fried chicken? Not here. The Chicken is just over smothered in the chipotle sauce and just makes the breading soft and mushy. 
The portion was huge. Don't even think about taking the rest to your hotel room unless you have a fridge. This thing spoils with a quickness. I got hungry and desperate later on the day, then I took one spoiled bite...that was it for my foodie vacation. I couldn't eat for 5 days. Not Hash house's fault I decided to eat spoiled food, but what do they expect you to do with their mammoth portions that spoil too quickly.
The service was bad. I am a Vegas early bird so I ate alone. They sat me at the counter. They said the bartender would take my order. I tried to order, but he ignored me and went in the kitchen to make someone's fancy barista coffee. That took 10 minutes. I tapped my fingers on the table and finally a waitress decided to take my order. Also, at the counter was a display of all the front-of-the-house problems and arguments for all to see. I could not relax with all their bickering, eye-rolling, and hustle and bustle. I don't think anyone liked each other. I don't think anyone liked working there. If you are dining solo, never ever let them sit you at the bar.

I had the fried chicken salad, because while I wanted something a little lighter, I also wanted to try that chicken!

The portions were huge--I don't think I saw anything come out of the kitchen that didn't look enormous. The salad was pretty good, good balance of dressing. But...the chicken was so overdone! It was dry and stringy and almost entirely inedible. I was so disappointed. It was breast meat, which is very easy to overcook, but come on--you're known for your fried chicken, get it together! To be fair, my friend who also had the chicken in her entree thought it was fine, so maybe it was just mine. Adding to all this, I had asked for red onions to be added, and they came in a little condiment cup rather than incorporated into the salad, and it was a 95 cent upcharge. What the hell. I would have been less disgruntled by the upcharge if it had actually been in the salad rather than served on the side like that. I've been to restaurants where they do absolutely no modifications and it's fine, I just need to know, but if you do and I ask for something to be added, please either actually add it to the dish or let me know it will be on the side! (Is this overly high maintenance of me? Oh well...)

Other thoughts: I thought the emphasis on presentation was a little overdone. Not everything needs rosemary sprigs and half an apple as a base for a knife stuck into the dish. It seems like the theme was sort of like a ""bigger is better"" idea. But--the complimentary honey-glazed biscuits were delicious! It wasn't an awful experience, but I was overall disappointed. I think the chicken being overdone really was the tipping point.",1,0,0

Unless you are Man vs Food caliber, expect to share or bring home leftovers. I did exactly that and shared my fried chicken eggs benedict with my boo thang. All in all it was very satisfying. What I can tell is that their fried chicken is very good. The batt contains corn flakes in it and the chicken stays juicy and moist yet fully cooked. In some ways the fried chicken is better than roscoe's (but that is up to debate, imo roscoe's) 

What was a pleasant delight was there BLT Bloody Mary. Containing a slice of bacon and lettuce (just because) and a side of toast.. honestly it probably was just the presentation of the bacon and toast added to the drink but it made the experience of drinking their bloody mary so much more enjoyable. Getting all of the Ooh and Aahs when served to my table was also nice, and quite honestly, the attention you get is half of the payoff, am i right?

-We had the corned beef hash with red onions and swiss cheese which was great.  I am not a huge fan of corned beef but the cheese that came with the corned beef was really good and made this stand out amongst all the other corned beef hashes I've had.
-The sage fried chicken and waffles were good, the chicken really stood out and really is to die for.  I wish I knew how to make the chicken just as well.  The waffles were okay, it tasted like any other waffles I've had--really nothing special. 
-The kiwi watermelon lemonade was okay, the three different mixtures were intriguing and it made me really curious.  However, it was a bit too sour for me so put some sugar if you want it sweeter!

Guys have them. No man is immune to them. No matter how he likes to boast how hetero he is and that having man crushes aren't very manly. Odds are that he's a closet man-crusher. Man crushing does not entail an intimate coital relationship. These are just guys that you may want to go to a bar with and throw down some brews and play darts (not the of the butt variety). The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... 

To bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes I'm not scared to say I have several....it's liberating), I decided to visit one of the places I've seen on a show I loosely base my life on. Man vs. Food (Adam Richaman). When I found out that I didn't have to drive off the Vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and I'm pretty sure I behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with Justin Timberlake (wet). 

I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. 

It's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor. So if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your Anchor Blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in Aria or Bellagio, stay out dickhead. Us regular people have more fun anyways.

Never liked pancakes because every time I eat them I feel like I am chewing Styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add Aunt Jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  

However, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and\/or Bloody Mary's  to wash that Styrofoam down. So, when we were in Vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG) at The LINQ before leaving Las Vegas like Nick Cage, I was like, ""of course honey"" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. 

When we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. We should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... Damn that hangover...  speaking of Hangover, if you get to the end of my review, I have a treat for you...

Anyways, I gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at The LINQ Promenade, which felt a lot like The Grove in Los Angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. This place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl\/guy from Drai's or Hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. 

By the time we got back to HHAGG, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. Then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. All I can say is that, it was weird just standing there. 

After a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, Andrew, served us. We ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a New York Times favorite on the menu... the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. 

Let me repeat - we SHARED this shit. 

This thing was humongous. It came with two Jurassic-sized fried chicken breasts with waffles that had hardwood smoked bacon cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. 

Truly amazing... All for less than $20! We ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by Andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. 

I've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. I've done the fancy at Bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at Roscoe's. But honestly, I have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that I literally sounded like I was having an orgasm as I ate and after I ate because I was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. Oooooh! Ohhhhhhhhhh! Oh gawd! 

Everything was tasty. The batter of the sage fried chicken was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. And the leeks! Holy smokes were they fucking delicious!

Look, people that give HHAGG a bad review are ""hhaggs"" that ended up not getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Stick to what they are good at. That is like going to Lawry's Prime Rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. Of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. 

Look, this place is open 24\/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and\/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to Hash House a Go Go. It will be the best decision you make. Just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.

* So I referenced the Hangover earlier... the following is a true story. I went to the Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles off Manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, ""hey I saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! Too-da-loooooo...""

The sheer volume of people that come through here has a huge impact on kitchen staff as food service is excruciatingly slow.  One of the dishes we ordered was the fried salmon sandwich and it came out 30 min after the chicken.  How does it take longer to fry fish than chicken?  The wait staff came by to check on us often and let us know that the fish would be coming out in 5 min. They must be on Spanish time cuz it took 30 min and we had to take it to go.  The person who ordered that was nonetheless very displeased since everyone else was done with their entrees before it came out.

You really need to understand one thing about HHAGG, the portion sizes are GARGANTUAN. I don't care how hungry you are, I can throw some food down and I barely finished half of my Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. When I say massive, it's an understatement. The pancakes are literally the size of a hubcap, no exaggeration. Seriously consider splitting an entree with someone else. You will not finish your food. 

The flavors are all amazing. The chicken in all the dishes has a crisp near perfection and a tenderness that is hard to find. And I highly recommend the snickers pancake, it literally has chunks of snickers cooked right into the pancake.

Yes, there's a huge crowd and a long wait, but it's worth it. By far our favorite breakfast spot while in Vegas. They temper the wait with serving the very best bloody Mary's in the world in the waiting area. Pickled green bean in my drank? Yes please!

Portions are enormous and perfect for taking half back to the hotel to eat later. Share a plate? Pffft, I think not. 

I've tried the salmon benedict and the salmon hash, and I think the hashes win over other stuff. I love their biscuits and the sage poking out of them is cute, but it makes the biscuit taste like sage so if you're not a huge fan you might want to ask for no sage in your biscuit. The homemade peach jam on the table is not as good as it sounds, and if you've ever had peach baby food, well then, there ya go. The biscuit is  more than fine without it, though.

Super delicious and worth navigating the Imperial Palace construction and the long wait.",0,0,1

We were told about how good everything is, and that it would be worth the wait.  Plus, we were there late Saturday morning, where people would be lined up for some serious eating to remedy their hangovers--I expected a wait, so the 30 minutes it took to get us a table didn't bother me.  

The service once we were seated, was spotty at best.  We were warned by our server that the wait for the food can be a little long, and we appreciated that--but after 20 minutes, coffee cups and water glasses were empty, and no one came by to check on us.  Food came out all at different times--the 3 others at my table all received their plates within a few minutes of each other, but my plate didn't show up for another 10 minutes--my husband had already finished his portion of his meal by the time I was able to start on mine.  Once our food had all arrived, our server completely disappeared; he never stopped by until we had been finished eating for at least 20 minutes, waiting for boxes and our check.  

Another issue I have with Hash House is their no substitutions policy.  I realize it adds some extra work for the kitchen, but if you are on any kind of special diet (especially for health issues), just be forewarned that they will not make any special substitutions.  My husband and I both have issues with gluten and the thought of eating a biscuit bigger than my fist just plain hurts--we had asked if we could substitute the biscuit for some fruit, and we couldn't--it was really a huge waste.  

However, the food we had was pretty good, and the BLT Mary I had was TASTY, so it's why I added the second star.  Still, I would be hard-pressed to give them my money again next time we're in Vegas.",0,0,0

I got the Fried Chicken Benedict with chipotle sauce. DAMN. It was a life changing experience. Mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, scrambled eggs, tomato, spinach, fried chicken, and cheese smothered in a creamy chipotle sauce. I just can't even explain the greatness that was this meal. 

The plates were huge! My husband and I should have shared but we didn't know how big the portions were. My husband got the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles. It was good, not life changing. He ended up eating what I ordered after a few bites. We didn't even make a dent in our plates. We maybe ate half.. Maybe.

I think had we ordered any of the hash dishes with meat, it would've been game over.

So here's what made it a 3star place: the location and wait. You think Imperial Palace is confusing to begin with, but wait until you try looking for this place. It's located on the second floor deep inside the casino. Oh, but you can't access it from the casino second floor... it's in its own little vicinity. Quite strange. And the wait took a while, around 45 minutes just to get seated. The service was slow and, on top of that, they forgot to put in our order, so we had to wait even longer.

Which isn't bad considering you can take a walk inside the casino for a bit before returning back to has house a go go.

Holy crap, the portions are huge! If you don't want to waste food nor money, split it with someone! I got the quesadilla which was really heavy so I only ate like 1\/3 of it and the person I shared it with also ate 1\/3 of it so we had 1\/3 uneaten.. so maybe even consider splitting it with 3 people if you don't really want a heavy breakfast. However, if you're craving comfort food for dinner or after a night out, maybe just split it with one other person.

The pot pie tasted terribly plain and almost watered down. As if this was made using a huge pot and sat there all day until served. The crust was not flavorful either, certainly not the usual flakey buttery crust pot pie usually is accompanied with. There was also way too much going on in the pot pie (corn, bell peppers, greens). Idk if this was distracting or the lack of flavor in the dish overall. I ended up only taking a few bites before losing my appetite.

My bf's chicken came out lukewarm. But apparently it was fried...? Didn't seem hot enough to be ""fresh"".

NOW OPEN 24 hours?! Wait, what?

First off: PACKED. 30-45 mins wait. Note that if you are a larger party, you will be waiting longer (5+ people = large). How they do their seating is: smaller parties first and then large parties. And you all have to be presented to be seated. If you check in with the host saying how many groups before you, she\/he will not tell you that it's one SMALL\/LARGE group before you - FYI.

Service: Our waitress was sassy at first. Maybe because it was a busy Saturday and everyone got on her nerves, but it was definitely not early... We went around 11 close to noon and it was crazy packed. Later on she was attentive to our needs and became nice. We tipped her anyway!

Food: LARGE PORTIONS. I cannot stress that enough. So if you're a hungry hippo, you'd be satisfied with your own plate, for sure. But a girlfriend and I split a dish. (I don't know what they're popular for, I just heard great things about this place). I ordered the Egg Benedict Smoked Salmon = HUGE. Nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. 

I wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. The dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit and mashed potatoes (starting from the top to the bottom layers). So definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. The flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.

I was actually not satisfied with my order. And it was on my end, not the restaurants. I should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and OMG so baaamb! 

Venue: It's in confusing area - The Quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. The restaurant is actually really big, and I couldn't tell because the way it's laid out.

Took me almost an hour to almost finishing it, but had to regrets. The dish had bacon, fried chicken, sauces, biscuits and gravy accounting for an amazing concoction of flavors. The only thing I didn't like was the biscuit, which didn't seem as hot as the rest and was dry. 

Other than that, a great experience!!",0,0,0

11:30AM on a 105-degree August Wednesday.  Line out the door.  That can't be a bad sign.

Wife got S'mores mocha to start.  It was a big hit.

Friend's wife got kiwi watermelon lemonade.  Interesting stuff, she raved over it.  

I got the sage fried chicken eggs benedict biscuit.  That was an enormous amount of stomach-orgasming food.  What a taste mix- juicy, crunch fried chicken, fully biscuit, awesome chipotle sauce (could have used a bit more, though) and mashed potatoes.  And I polished off every bit of it (no bullshit.)  

Wife got the banana pancake and holy Buddha on a stick, that was some incredible stuff.  A crunchy layer on top, about a foot across in diameter... and I got to eat about half of it (on top of my biscuit.  Yes, I am indeed the man.  Of course, I didn't want to eat for the rest of the day, but stop for a minute and give me some applause.)

Friend's chicken and waffles were fantastic, and everyone else raved over his wife's biscuits and gravy (which were so damned big, over half remained after her attempt and hubby's to eat it.)  Personally I thought the sausage was a little weak in it, but it was tasty.

I must thank the fine purveyors of this food not only for the insanely good quality and Godzilla-like proportions, but the fact that prices are just a couple of bucks higher than some casino coffee shop for a breakfast with 75% less volume and flavor is a real testament to the fact that they want you to enjoy the shit out of your meal.

The potato to scramble ratio was 3:1, where the potato was definitely considered the main item and the scramble was the 'side'.

As we admired other people's sage fried chicken and waffles (which looked like a gargantuan tower), the waitress took our drink orders. Despite having yard drinks in front of us, we decided to try the BLT Mary out of the sheer oddity of it. It was a spicy bloody mary served with a tomato round, lettuce, and bacon slice inside, a bacon salt rim, and a piece of toast. Not the most flavorful bloody mary I've had, but still good and very original. 

I went with the Smoked Salmon Hash (house-smoked salmon, scallions, scrambled eggs, potatoes, cream cheese, fruit and a huge biscuit on the side) while my date went with the quesadilla (chicken, jalapenos, potatoes, some other things, topped with chili cream and served over mashed potatoes). Both plates were shockingly huge, and we each got through about 1\/3 of them. 

I really enjoyed my dish and the combination of ingredients, and the salmon portion was very generous. My date, who usually makes fun of me for being white and not being able to handle spicy things, had to take some of the chopped jalapeno out because there was so much of it.

The wait was extensive but they have a bar to kill time. I ordered the BLT Mary. Really creative, it came with a piece of toast, a packet of mayonnaise and a large slab of bacon. The Mary part itself was a bit tasteless, but a fun experience and attention grabber. 

Our server was quite friendly and attentive... quirky attitude, but I love that in a person so it was a win for me.

WARNING: Do not try this as a stop over on a long trip, you will soon find yourself asleep at the wheel and possibly killing your entire family....just saying. 

I will be back, this time with Tupperware.",1,0,0

Really not bad at all, seeing as how when I tried to come back on saturday with a different group of friends it was a hour and a half wait.

The food was good but not worth that type of wait. I ordered the chicken and waffles, which were on all the advertisements of this place. The serving size is the real star of the whole dish: four large waffles and two huge pieces of chicken skewered together by a steak knife. The chicken was fried well but tasted bland, nothing to really write home about. The waffles were interesting in that the had two pieces of bacon inside of them. Again the waffles were good also but nothing spectacular. I prefer quality over quantity but this dish really exemplifies quantity.

The atmosphere of the place is what would be expected of a diner with a rock flair to it. It was fun to see all the celebrities that have come through this place though. They have autographed pictures on the wall in the waiting area.

Our waiter was friendly when he was around but that was few and far between. It seemed like it was too busy for him to provide the service that you would expect. I don't think anyone at my table got a refill on any of our drinks.

Overall, I'm glad I at least tried this place once and I would eat at it again...but I wouldn't wait  any longer than 15 minutes. Vegas has plenty of places that serve better food albeit smaller or normal sized portions.",0,0,0

It was absolutely amazing, and I wasn't quite sure that I was going to enjoy it, considering that chicken and waffles is a southern thing and I'm from the Midwest.

I would give this place 5 stars, but the food is only spectacular because of the portions.  I honestly would get a take home box, but I don't want to hold that stuff around Vegas.

Ordered the Chicken and Waffles - a 12 inch tower of 4 waffles, 2 breaded chicken breasts, fried green onion stalks, a stalk of rosemary, and a tiny cup (2 tablespoons?) of syrup. After deconstructing the tower to try to actually eat it, I found the chicken tasted decent on it's own (however there was a hidden leg bone, maybe 3 inches long, sticking out of the gigantic breasts, which I have no idea why it was left there and surprised there have not been several choking accidents as it's hidden in the mound of food), the waffles (which had overcooked bacon strips underneath) were so dry because there was not enough syrup, and the fried green onion stalks were tough and inedible - did not at all make for wonderful culinary bites. BF ordered the BBBLT (a bacon bacon BLT) - super thick greasy texas toast, 10 pieces of burned bacon, a sliver of tomato and a leaf of lettuce - after a few bites he removed most of the bread and barely touched his fries.

We got there about 7 AM, the place was almost deserted and we were seated immediately.  Just after we were seated the server came over, took our order for coffee, water and a large (fresh & tasty) tangerine juice.  

When she returned several minutes later with our bevs, she asked if we still needed time to decide, which we did. When she came back we still didn't know what we wanted so she gave us a few suggestions and told us her favs as well.  

We like servers who tell you THEIR favs, not just what ""other"" people like or a list of just about everything on the menu.  

After several suggestions she sold us on the Sage Chicken Benedict and a side of fruit.  

For those of you who had bland food at HHAGG, I'm so sorry! =(  Ours was anything but.  

From the bottom up here's how the Benedict went:
Biscuits: Soft, warm and fluffy
Mashed potatoes: half hash brown, half mashed, griddled with a nice browned crispiness
Eggs: not over done, not underdone, just right
Smoked bacon: everything bacon should be; salty, thick and smoky 
Spinach and tomato: A good offset to the heaviness of the dish 
sage fried chicken: holy yummers!!!  Ours wasn't bland at all; it was sage-y & succulent 
Griddled cheese: a crisp & tangy blanket of heaven
Chipotle cream benedict sauce: the perfect rich and zesty topping to a decadent breakfast

Oh and the fruit...it was called a small side but it had 2 thick slices of cantaloupe, 4 thick wedges of pineapple, 4 -6 strawberries, several orange slices.  It was ripe and tasty, no sub-par ""garnish-grade"" fruit here; and just $3.95",1,0,0

As I went up, she followed closely behind and said to go straight to the bar as the floors where wet since ""they were closing"" (she could've said this close to 5 times) I approached the bar and was greeted by a kind bartender who made me an unspiked kiwi watermelon lemonade. I paid and as I was making my way out I saw a gate had been brought down in front of the escalators. I asked the host which way I could get out and was told through double doors near the escalators, but the same manager came up out of nowhere and snapped once again with an attitude, ""you take the elevator"".

Even sharing this with one other person is still more than enough food for me. They give you about 3 pieces of each the chicken and the waffles, but they are 3 large pieces of each. The chicken is really succulent and the batter isn't too greasy. It has a distinct flavor and doesn't taste like your typical fried chicken. It's even better paired with the waffles! The waffles are thick and have small pieces of bacon in them, which is pretty interesting tasting but still great especially topped with the maple syrup. While everything tastes amazing, one of my favorite parts of the dish were by far the fried leeks! I had never had them cooked that way and it adds a crunch to the dish. All of the sweet and savory aspects just fuse so well together. Make sure to get a little of everything for each bite.

Everything from the salmon, to the crispy potatos, to the fried chicken, to the griddled french toast in banana cinnamon cream w\/ pecan maple syrup (my absolute favorite!) was made exceptionally well.  It was all quite impressive and I guess you can ""church it up"" by sticking a strand of rosemary into a biscuit.  Btw, that biscuit was good, but it was heavy and dense enough to be a paper weight.  Coffee was pretty good tasting for an average cup of joe as well.

Portions were large and if your appetite and stomach can munster finishing everything on your plate, then you can forego your next meal.  We skipped out on lunch after have a late breakfast (saved some money that way) and we walked it off by strolling the strip and seeing the sights afterwards.  Just remember, get there early before lunch or earlier for dinner and hopefully you won't have to put up with the long wait.",0,0,1

Went about 5:30pm since we were starving, hardly anyone in the place.  Interesting décor with a lot of aluminum, including the tables.  Had the BEST waitress.  Hubby had the 1 pound stuffed burger (roasted peppers & mozzarella), BFF the Blue Crab (with linguine) appetizer (meal sized) and I had the stuffed meatloaf (roasted peppers, fresh spinach, mozzarella).  Drinks were just iced tea.  The food was wonderful and of course WAY, WAY too much of it.  HH adds the 18% tip on the bill when using the certificates, the whole bill came to $34.20 - what a deal!  5 stars

I ordered the salmon hash and what I received did not resemble a plate of hash in the least. The ingredients were not finely chopped as hash ingredients should be, but rather, were cut in VERY large pieces resembling a stew rather than a hash and lacked the crispy texture well-made hashes typically have. In addition, my poached egg was terribly over-cooked, even though I had requested an egg with a runny yolk.

I have been wanting to try HHAGG for a long time, but it never seems to work out. I finally made it on Tuesday morning and felt sick all day. It's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because I LOVE carbs).

The meal just started off on the wrong foot. I HATE spicy food, and I have a weak tolerance. I ordered the HH Original which is smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. All this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of mashed potatoes. Reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. Not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which I was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. It sent my taste buds into a frenzy and I really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. It really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal.

A little hard to find, you go up a narrow escalator to it. 
It was not busy at all and we came in around 3pm\/ 25 mins till dinner menu.
Waitress was very nice. My bf and I admired the staffs gauges and tattoos.
I thought the brunch menu looked great. I wanted something eggy but my bf wanted ""food food"" and wanted a burger. I wasn't in the mood for the burger so I was eyeing the crispy pork sandwich, somehow thinking it was going to be like pulled pork, I dunno what was going on in my mind xD
He tells the waitress he is interested in the dinner menu, and she tells him that the dinner menu starts in 25 mins and asked him if he wanted to wait. She comes back with the dinner menu so we can decide if we want the Brunch or Dinner menu and there is hardly a difference. He then tells her nevermind, he'll have something from the brunch menu and he ordered the burger with the bacon and mash potatoes.
I got the crispy pork AND HOLYS*** it was HUGE. I ended up just cutting off the extra meat, ate that, and saved the burger for dinner(their portions are huge btw.) My bf also didn't finish his burger and let me have a taste, and the bun was very very good (mine had grains and stuff on it, his was glossy).

I'd say his meal reminded me of something drunk people would want to eat, and mine reminded me of tempura. He got soda while I got the fresh-squeezed tangerine juice. I wouldn't get it again, as it wasn't too flavorful (was not watery, just needed sugar :c)

The gambling, the casinos, the people, and most importantly, the food.

The days of the $9 prime rib dinner has been replaced by Michelin rated establishments charging $85 for a steak and French pressed coffee going for $9 during brunch.  After a day of eating very well, we decided to hit Hash House because I had heard about their insane platters of food as well as creative takes on classic dishes, such as the Eggs Benedict, for example.  We came here for an early dinner since hiking in Zion takes the most out of everyone and we had not had a decent breakfast beforehand.

The menu is diverse with many options so make sure to make your selections.  I settled for the Stuffed Meatloaf, my friends ordered the Bone-In Ribeye and their infamous Fried Chicken and Bacon-in the batter-waffles.  This joint is not lying about large portions.  The Fried chicken and waffles were a good 14 inches high stacked, and that did not count in the sprig of rosemary on top.  My stuffed meatloaf dinner was actually two huge slices of meatloaf sandwiching a mound of delicious melted mozzarella cheese, red peppers, and spinach.  The small hill of mashed potatoes was a creamy and packed with butter.  My friend's Ribeye was done perfectly and the meat tender to cut into.  While I found his mashed sweet potato concoction interesting, my plain mashed potatoes would have tasted better with his entrée.  The Fried Chicken and Waffles are the sure bet here, however, since the chicken was moist and done right with the amount of spices.  The waffles were also very good, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  The bacon bits in the batter were also a nice surprise.  My meatloaf was good but lacked flavor, almost as if they forgot to add some sort of seasoning to the mix but everything else on my plate was great, right down to the green beans on the side, which picked up the slack.

I was going to opt for one of their stuffed burgers but when the waitress stated that it was part of their policy to cook them medium well to ensure they would be cooked thoroughly, I decided to pass.  I prefer my burgers medium rare.  

If you have never visited, do so at least for the experience.  You won't regret the visit, not to mention the selfie photo ops.

I'll make my way back for something different on their menu next time and bring a larger appetite!  Their breakfast items sounded like an adventure!",5,3,6

If you look back on any of my reviews, you'll find that it's pretty uncommon for me to go against the Yelpy grain probably because I lean towards spots that are already highly rated and they're highly rated for a reason. Additionally, I very rarely give 1-Star reviews. In this case? It's absolutely warranted, as my experience at Hash House A Go Go was a bad one through and through. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

I like the 24 hour contemporary diner vibe at Hash House A Go Go, but my service was absolutely dreadful. Sure, there were a decent number of people present at 0300 on a Sunday morning, but it certainly wasn't overwhelming and HHAGG wasn't by any means short staffed. Even so, it took a good 10 minutes for our server to notice that we'd been seated, and once our orders were put in, it was 25 minutes gone by until our server stopped by and very obviously realized that someone had gone wrong in the supply chain. He scampered back to the kitchen (literally ran) and roughly ten minutes later, or 35 minutes in total, three of our four orders came out. Ten minutes later he stopped by again, only to realize that 25% of our order was still missing. Another sprint back to the kitchen and all four of us had our food 55 minutes after putting in our orders. That is absolutely unacceptable by every single metric, and while I may have understood if something were comp'd, the thought clearly didn't even cross anyone's mind. What a mess. No Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

This is the one place where I can't complain. Opting for one of my favorite dishes (corn beef hash), I was pleased to have paid only $12.99 at a place that could very easily gouge for more. As you'll see in the picture below, these were pretty hardy portions, and I left not feeling as though I'd been ripped off. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

What on earth was this? Let's be clear, corned beef hash is finely chopped corned beef pan cooked in with potatoes and eggs maybe with a bit of cheese to bring everything together. It's a wonderful dish, and one of the great things about it is that it's exceptionally difficult to mess up.

What I received instead of corned beef hash, as you can also see in the picture, was a poorly mixed monstrosity. Lousy and flavorless ""scrambled"" eggs on the side. A hard and flavorless biscuit next door, and a mound of poorly seasoned potatoes with a clump of shredded and rubbery corned beef sitting atop it. Nothing was mixed together, nothing had good flavor, and all in all this was a colossal disappointment. No Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

It's apparent to me based on the other reviews that my experience was an odd one here at Hash House A Go Go, but off day or not, this was one of the poorer dining experiences in recent memory in a town that's chalk full of great dining. I won't be back. No Star Granted.",2,2,2

I saw this place featured on Man v. Food and on countless billboards around the Strip. This location, inside Imperial Palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. I was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. Before I even looked at the menu, I knew I wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. While I waited for my order to arrive, I saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. All looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. I salivated each time my beloved (or so I thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. Finally it arrived, moment of truth. I bite into my deep fried chicken breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. Batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch I had imagined. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved on to the waffles, hoping that Hash House would redeem themselves here. But alas, I was disappointed yet again. The waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet I lamented again when I found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. 

Needless to say I walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. Will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord.",0,0,0

The food definitely deserves five stars but I'm rating the entire experience so I have to knock off a star for service.  I think you're pretty safe to order just about anything on the menu and it will be wonderfully satisfying.  To me, the Hand Hammered Port Tenderloin is the absolute best choice and I've ordered it just about every time we've been here!  I take the liberty of sampling everybody else's choices though so I've eaten quite a few menu items.  No matter what I order though, I'll make sure it comes with the mashed potatoes because I tell you what, those are the absolute best!

Service however isn't the greatest.  It's sort of slow and sometimes really really hard to get!  It's always packed and I understand they are busy but maybe management needs to have a few more workers on the floor that can actually help the diners.  There were four workers cleaning tables and sweeping the floor that couldn't even fill our water glasses!  The servers are also pretty territorial and really won't help unless you're in their section.  That being said, they are all super friendly and smile a lot so it kind of makes you not realize you're not being helped!  It's definitely not bad enough to make me ever say I won't return, it's just not that great and people should know what to expect so I'm throwing it out there!

They do not have their own restroom and in my hunt to find an open one in the casino I returned to discover that our food had already arrived! 

My husband had the pork tenderloin benedict and boy was it massive. He only finished a 3rd of it. My mom and I split the tractor special with cinnamon banana nut french toast. It you are sharing an item there is a $2.25 charge unless you order a side dish so I ordered my own side of scrambled eggs. What this meant was we each had our own eggs and one BIG piece of french toast, half a grilled banana and she ate both pieces of bacon. We also shared a fresh squeezed tangerine juice which was unusual and very good. My mom said it was the best french toast she had ever had for what that is worth! 

Our server was Travis and he was nice and helpful with suggestions since this was our first time here. I think he may have psychic powers since he suggested exactly what we were looking at in addition to the popular chicken and waffles. 

They sell the same shirts that the servers wear for about $16 and they have a variety of hats that I think are $21-ish. If you are interested in buying any merchandise tell your server as they can add it to your total bill. Otherwise, you will be like us and making a separate payment at the bar after your meal is over. The sign said they have a lot more items than what they seemed to have in stock.

I walked up to the hostess in which she informed me it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was NOT BAD AT ALL compared to other great restaurants in Vegas. Unfortunately, they don't offer pagers or take your number down to text you and let you know your table is available. But we managed to go downstairs for some quick gambling and came back in 25 minutes to check up in our table. Not too long after, we were seated! Very prompt on timing!

I had been hearing amazing things about the place for a few years and decided I just HAD to go last time I was in Vegas.  We went for breakfast and arrived around 10:00 or 10:30.  The line was HUGE!  Out the door, standing room only in the waiting area, back to back kind of line.  We took the number we were given and with a wait time estimate of ""about an hour"" went down to the casino to lose some cash while we waited.  

After about 30 minutes we went back upstairs to the standing room only section and waited about 20 more minutes until a seat on one of the benches opened.  We sat down and waited another 30  minutes for our names to be called.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT!!!!!  The wait is long but IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!

The place has an awesome ambiance.  They have several different dining areas all with a different feel.  They have tons of wait staff all wearing awesome and fun socks.  The abundance of wait staff makes your wait time for re-fills or condiments close to zero.  The food took awhile to get out but we were warned about that when we were seated because of how busy it was.

The food is actually artwork!  I got a BLT that was the size of a toaster with a huge piece of sage sticking out of it.  It was amazing and delicious.  When I got the bill for it I actually laughed out loud.  I had been in Vegas for 4 days now and had paid WAY too much for subpar food - this food was AWESOME and comparably super cheap - great value!!!!!!!!

I am told Hash House a Go-go has a couple of locations in different cities - I will make sure to go for a visit every time I am in one of those cities!

Go to Hash House and ENJOY!!!!  5 Stars for food, price, wait staff and every thing else!",2,0,1

We shared the following 2 dishes for 3 people. 

Sage Fried Chicken: My go-to! I could not wait to be reunited with this dish again. I started at the top of the dish - working my way through the eggs and bacon mixed with potatoes and gravy. Eventually, I got to the fried chicken hidden among the AMAZINGNESS :) 

I remember it being a lot better last time. I think i overhyped it in my head. Chicken was bland. 

Corned Beef House Hash: I loved the combo of corned beef with the sliced potatoes. 

I preferred the Corn Beef Hash over the Sage Fried Chicken which was is surprising. Ask any of my friends - I love me some chicken.

The first two times I went to the original place on Sahara Blvd about 10 min of the Strip but then I found out the Quad (FKA, Imperial Palace) had one (which is right next to where I stayed) so I had to go again..lol

You will not believe the portions at this place!  The Pancakes look like the size of a medium Pizza (or Hubcaps), Their Benedict creations are not only monstrous they are off the hook! Personally I liked the Chicken one that was on MvF better than the Pork Filet  but the Pork one could easily feed three people (I'm 250+ lbs and it fed me twice and admittedly I should have split it into thirds). The last time I went, I was with a buddy and his son who said they live down the street from Rosco's Chicken & Waffle's then said ""These are better than Rosco's"" when referring to Hash Houses Chicken & Waffle tower (They were very good, but I've never had Chicken & Waffles before)",0,1,0

Obviously, if you're going on a weekend, expect a decent wait.  Our group of 8 had to wait about an hour to get seated on Sunday around 11am.  But there was plenty to keep us entertained until it was our turn to eat.
I had the chicken and waffles, which was amazing.  The chicken is cooked perfectly - I loved the sweetness that the maple reduction added to the chicken.  And the biscuit that comes on the side was also delicious.  The only downside (which might just be me) is how big it is.  I wish I had known before ordering so that I could've shared.  I couldn't even eat a third of it, and it's not one of those dishes that make for good leftovers.  So if you decide to get this, share with a friend!
The other winner at our table was the quesadilla.  I didn't get to try it, but my friend loved it.

It was like 4 biscuits, like two whole chicken breasts, spinach, eggs, tomatoes, whole heap of cheese, bacon and topped off with an entire sage branch.  LOL marvelous.

I don't think so, but if there is, let me know. I woke up early, so I headed downstairs by myself to get some HH. It's always going to be a crazy wait, but since I was by myself I just hung around at the bar until a seat opened. That was much faster than the 45 minute estimate given to me by the hostess.

I ordered a SMOKED SALMON SCRAMBLE ($14.25), which also comes with basil pesto, fresh tomato, brie cheese, potatoes, and a biscuit. I have to say...this wasn't my favorite. The salmon kind of got lost in everything else, and it tasted pretty average. That being said, I HAVE been to Hash House in the past and ordered other things that were better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However, the portions were as big as ever, and I ended up taking a third of it back.

I am also going easy on the food because the service was absolutely amazing here. Everyone behind the bar was so friendly and willing to hold conversations with me. My water was constantly being topped off, and I didn't feel like I was there alone at all. 

Come for the food, stay for the atmosphere. Though the food missed the mark a bit for me this time, I know they have winners on their menu. Maybe stick to the choices that adhere more to their ""twisted farm food"" slogan and don't try to go healthy like me.

The food it self is good and each plating has a very unique design. They are known for their FRIED CHICKEN, so order it! Their chicken has a very sweet mapley crunch taste. Maple reduction=syrup.

We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Indiana Favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w\/Benedict, and Farm Benedict Hash House Original. NOTE: Their biscuits are HUGE but on the dry side, as well as their mash potatoes and for the waffles that came with fried chicken, it has BACON in it (YES, BACON!!!). Also that dish comes with fried leeks (long leafy onions), LOTS of it, so if you don't like them, ask for them on the side or something.

They told us it would be about 45 minutes so our party of 4 scattered to check out the new LINQ. 25 minutes later I came back up while my wife went to the restroom. I asked how much longer the wait would be and the hostess told us they had called us and jumped our spot but if we waited, we could be seated within 10 minutes. My son and his friend walked up just behind me and it was still going to be less than the 45 minutes that we were told or expected. Just as we sat down [3 of us], they called us back. NO 10 MINUTE WAIT! HUH! That was still OK but seemed a little unorganized. 

When the 3 us walked up, the hostess asked us if our entire party was here and I explained that my wife was in the restroom but on her way. She starts to tell me that we all have to be there to be seated.. as she is telling me this the cashier tells her to go ahead and seat us. THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED! The hostess rolled her eyes. 

NOW, normally my kids, family and close friends know I don't tolerate that kind of response. I quickly quipped something back that was not nice not vulgar either. I did mention that she should refrain from rolling her eyes at clients and maybe something about her being cross-eyed [she was]. BUT, I did make it quietly and short since my son had a friend from college with him and I did not want to embarrass him. I also don't know if she rolled her eyes at me or at the cashier.

Anyways they took us to a booth and I explained that i had asked for a table. I hate booths, what is your choice: table or booth? As we are traveling back through the main door my wife met up with us and we were taken to a table. A few minutes later, as we were looking through the menu, there was an incident where a table next us that could have 6 persons had about 9. They were arguing with the waitress, hostess and some manager that was just king of hovering. We didn't pay much attention, we were amazed by the plates that were moving across the floor. We all decided quickly to SHARE the chicken and waffles [1 plate per couple] and we still both took some home.

THE FOOD. Regardless of the initial problems, the food is good enough to give the House 4 stars. The restaurant is creative and the quality of food is good enough to justify waiting and even having to deal with a few minor problems.

Their food is always fabulous and the service is impeccable! We've had several of their eggs benedict, including the fried chicken...sooooo yummy! And their fried chicken and waffles is absolutely amazing! The chicken is perfectly crisp yet stays moist and tender. And the waffles, believe it or not, actually have bacon strips INSIDE the waffles! I've never had anything like it and the syrup is scrumptious too! Though because it was so good we had to ask for more, but our server brought it to us promptly. The cheeseburgers are also absolutely amazing! Beware the portions are huge! My hubby and I always share something, and trust me he's a big eater!
And FYI, the bloodymary's there are really really good. They will of course ask if you want premium vodka, which costs about $3 more, but I say stick with the well and you'll be fine. It's not like you're going to have ten of them anyway (or will you?). 
I can't say enough great things about this restaurant, we have always had great food and great service no matter what time of day or night. We will always visit this place once or twice every time we're in Vegas...we're just waiting for them to open up here in the bay area....course that wouldn't be very good for my hips, but who cares???",2,0,0

She said she couldn't stand to be the only person wearing their T-shirt.  And yes, we were so jealous when she went back to Vegas without us for a conference and took pictures to send our way.  (There were some names that were used in text exchanges, but thats neither here nor there.) 

We were just there in June.   And nostalgically I recall that someone ordered their pancakes...stupid enormous, I had french toast and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Did I say side?  More like a HUGE portion for one.  Hubby had corned beef hash and says it was too good to not continue eating.  (I know he over did it because he could barely eat ONE In and Out Burger 4 hours later!)

Hash House is a solid restaurant at The Quad (formerly known as Imperial Palace) which opens late...or maybe even 24 hours (not sure on that). Every single dish here serves in large quantity. If you fancy a pancake with the size of your face + head, you will be happy here. 

We came here on the night before our wedding with my family. There were 10 of us and service was top notch. Food came out hot and tasty. A few of us have burgers and they looked mighty delicious. I had an Omelette with all the fixins and I was a happy camper.

I love  Hash House, but I don't love the smokey filling of the place. It was on the top floor of The Quad and if you've ever been to Vegas you know how tight and smokey The Quad is. If you've never been to Vegas..well The Quad only has one smell which is Ciggys smell.

Was in Vegas the past few nights and absolutely loved Hash House A Go Go.  We could not get over how massive the portions were and how tasty the food was.  So much so in fact, that we visited two mornings in a row!  The first morning I had their take on an eggs benedict that featured griddled mashed potatoes, a red pepper cream sauce with spinach, tomatoes and bacon.  TO DIE FOR.  Impossible to finish.  My boyfriend had the chorizo hash which was also delish, but my benny took the gold medal on that meal. 

The next morning we re-visited and I had waffles with bacon, eggs and crispy potatoes.  The meal was pretty standard, but the waffles put this meal at 4 stars. This morning, my boyfriend tried the house favourite Fried Chicken Benedict.  UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE. The chipotle cream sauce absolutely makes this dish, coupled with their famous Sage Fried Chicken.

2x Sage Fried Chicken N Waffles
1x Sage Fried Chicken Benedict
2 Coffee drinks (Something with mint... cant remember!)

Chicken was very flavorful, juicy, and piping hot! The waffles we soft and fluffy, also there was bacon in them too! I've had chicken n waffles elsewhere and this by far is the largest portion provided. The waiter mentioned they were large, but this was ridiculous! 
The food was good overall, but the main downside is that none of us finished any of our dishes. I want to say about 20% remained unfortunately after eating way too much!

The FAMOUS sage fried chicken w\/ waffle: The sage chicken is too hard and too bland. Sadly. A little salt and pepper can go a long way. The waffle was delicious, though. The best and only thing I loved on the menu.

Sage chicken salad - Same comment about the chicken. The salad was HUGE (like all their other dishes)! It was okay, but the ingredients can be a little more refined. There was no balance, just a heap of food put together on a plate. Fresh ingredients though.

I had it on my list and was making sure I was not going to leave Vegas without trying it. It was easy to find.  Just head straight through the Imperial Palace until you hit the escalators.  We were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  It was pretty busy and also a Friday morning.  We were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  I ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.

One thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. I thought OK, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  Eh, not so much.   Our food took a bit to come out.  It wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.

Due to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  My dining partner and I chose the HH original Benedict.  It comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  Additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. The potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when I was a kid with leftover mashed potatoes-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. That was probably the best thing about the Benedict.  The bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.

 Now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  The thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  So I guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  Also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  Had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  I think having those put on top of the Benny just made it even colder in temp.  Also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  

The red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  I really do like the concept of having a Benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  I kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy mashed potatoes.  I will say that I was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  Our bill came to $12 each, and I was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.

My other friends ordered the Bananas Foster French toast-also huge, as well as the Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  My friend did not like her hash at all.  I tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  I hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  I think it should come out seasoned correctly.  Also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  The bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  What I did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  It was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  It was served still in the peel, which I thought was pretty cool.

Overall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  I can only base this review on the one visit I made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   Although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  However, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, I would like to go back and prove that Hash House can really live up to its hype.",4,2,2

Don't be that guy that stinks up the entire floor of your hotel with the nasty smell of your leftovers, which you probably wont even eat.",0,0,0

2011: Saturday at 2 pm, crazy lines, terrible service and we almost left. We stuck it out and loved the food and conveniently let the rest of the experience go...

2012: Friday breakfast, 10 am reservation. We were 45 minutes late but they were perfectly fine with it (we called to let them know) and were seated right away even if there was a long line of people waiting. Server was spectacular, even offered us to-go cups for our drinks if we wanted them. 

Food is always a winner:
- Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food Fave) - amazing and huge. the mashed potatoes are unbelievable, especially aside the chipotle cream. Chicken was moist and tender. (recommend to share this with someone)
- Snickers Flapjack - table favorite
- Corned Beef Hash Scramble - winner as well

Gluttonous experience if you want it to be, otherwise share the entrees. And doesnt hurt that the Roulette tables at Imperial Palace are only $5. Cheapest we've found in Vegas!",0,0,0

I have eaten at that San Diego location plenty of times never this one. The wait was a usual 30 min quote we probably waited 15-20. While waiting looked over menus had an idea of what I wanted to eat once seated as usual that goes out the door. Speaking with Brain decided to have the Roasted Chicken garlic Hash or however it's stated. That was one of the most flavorful dishes I have had and the dang on biscuit. I don't care for biscuits at all but it kept staring at me so unassuming it was begging for me to try it. It was moist flaky and light. I just had some more of said biscuits hours later without heating it up and it's still good. Give it a try. Hope your experience is just as good as mine.,0,0,0

Fried Chicken Benedict: WOW! The sauce that's on there... amazing! And definitely enough for two! Definitely worth a try!

Sage chicken and waffles: There were whole pieces of bacon but the waffles were soggy . The syrup wasn't your average syrup, it had all sorts of seasonings in it... Hmm now wondering if they had the good ol' plain syrup, (we tried to stay on the adventurous side since... this is Vegas, that's probably the sage)! 

Caesar salad with chicken: Just like one would expect an average Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Although, the croutons do have a twist, they're cubed pieces of soft cornbread, so I didn't get that ""crunch"" that I was looking for. But again, a large portion!

It's improved since it became the Quad but still a dump. The food was about the same quality as I've had at the other locations and the service was pretty good considering how busy they were. However, the food took 40+ minutes to come out. Our poor server kept trying to stall for the kitchen and I can see it in his face that he was frustrated and didn't want to point fingers at the kitchen. But it was obvious many tables were not happy with the long waits. At least provide bread or something to the tables if your food is going to take that damn long (come to think of it maybe we should have asked for some).

Ordered the Chicken and Waffles... but didn't get to enjoy it because I got kind of full just waiting on the food to arrive. Flavors were good but I felt like it was better at the Sahara location. Friends enjoyed there food so that's always good when you bring first timers.

Biggest issue with this location is the complete lack of cell phone service. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CHECK-IN???!!! lol But seriously, the Quad and Hash House need to figure out a solution to this issue. Offer ""Free Wi-Fi"" or something! As someone who relies on his phone for work I have to say it's a bit stressful to sit through lunch at a place where I don't have access to anything on my phone.

The waffles though, were not as good. They were normal, dry waffles that one would expect. The difference was that these waffles had bacon inside. It was a unique style of preparation, but I could have done without them. 

As for the sauteed leeks, I didn't really understand why they were part of the dish. But hey, I like leeks, so I'm not going to complain about them.

These portions are NO JOKE.  You are guaranteed to drag your feet back to wherever you came from due to a massive food coma.

The three of us made the mistake of each ordering our own dish.  HUGE mistake, as each of us probably finished 30% of our meal.

Unfortunately we hadn't gotten out of the house early enough to make it in time for breakfast\/lunch and could only order off the dinner menu. We were starving and had a hell of a time getting to Imperial Palace in the first place so we decided to stay and check it out. 

We were well aware of their HUGE portions so we ordered the Slow Cooked Bar B' Que Pork Ribs on a bed of horseradish potato salad from the ""Just 4 grazing"" section of the menu and the Boston Hash (Crispy potatoes, mixed onions, fresh tomatoes all crowned with Andy's famous all blue crab cake drizzled with horseradish cream and served with scrambled eggs) from the ""Late Breakfast"" section.  I would have liked the horseradish cream to be a little spicier to give the dish more of a kick. There was more than enough food to feed the both of us and we brought a small box home of leftovers. 

As my career is geared towards pastries I am often browsing the dessert menu even on a full stomach just to see what's available. We decided to share a double shot of espresso poured over a very large scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. MMM this was my favorite part of the meal! 


The restaurant itself was pretty empty. Our server was genuine and nice. It definitely could have been worse ;) Overall I enjoyed the experience and would definitely go again.",0,0,0

Also, I didn't even realize my meal was off until the end but I was too disappointed to bother bringing it up to our waiter. The idea of Sage Fried Chicken sounds amazing but mine just wasn't all that great. The batter was bland. The chicken was soo dry that after every bite I felt the need to down mouthfuls of water just to get it all down without choking. I got only one piece of chicken rather than two with the four bacon waffles. So essentially, I paid $18.50 for one piece of super dry fried chicken and four mediocre waffles. I thought I wad trippin that I somehow forgot that I ate the chicken or bf ate it when I wasnt looking but I confirmed my suspicions with the picture I took.

I like that the dish is beautifully garnished but I dont like that they pour the syrup on the waffles prior to bringing it out. I normally don't like too much syrup on my waffles so that was disappointing and it came out soggy because it had been sitting.
The only thing I absolutely liked was the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. It tasted refreshing after an exhausting day on the strip. The server was nice and kept our glasses full but the food wasnt all that great.

Decided to have breakfast here on Saturday and arrived at around 12:30pm.  There were a ton of people ahead of us and the wait was like 30-minutes but we decided to stick it out.

We had enough time waiting that we looked through the menu and knew what to order.  The s\/o was ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I had the Chorizo Hash.  Fast forward 10-15 minutes...They bring out the plates and God have mercy, the s\/o's C&W was huge!  I would've helped eat it but it came with two, yup, two breasts and I don't like white meat.  The s\/o liked it and said the chicken was flavorful.  My Chorizo Hash was terribly good and spicy.  It had tons of jalapenos on it which radiated it's spiciness.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and delicious, geez, even my eggs were delicious!  I didn't care too much for the biscuit though, it was a little dry.

Our server, Marcelino I think his name was, he was super attentive and friendly.  He anticipated what we needed right when we're about to ask for it.  The entire staff was friendly and seemed to help each other out, even the manager refilled our drinks, way to go team!

We were NOT disappointed! The portions were HUGE! The 6 of us shared 3 dishes and it was plenty. I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and not only was it huge...it was delicious! Fried chicken on top of a massive mound of biscuits and gravy, all smothered in their own sauce, Don't go for it if you're on some kind of strict diet, but if you're looking for something that you can share and still fill up on, by all means get the Fried Chicken benedict, or any of their other benedicts. 

I also got their House Special Bloody Mary, which definitely had a kick to it! Bloody Marys have a special taste to them, so if you're not sure you like Bloody Marys in general, maybe they aren't for you. But if you know you do like them, then this place does it well! 

The service was great, also. Our waitress was always within earshot and made sure we were doing okay. One of my friends' orders was wrong (she got sunny side up eggs, but she wanted scrambled) and was instantly given a new plate of scrambled eggs, and she also got to keep her old plate, so that was great! More food!

The only reason this place lost one star was the long wait, which was even longer because they called our name way before their predicted time. They told us about 1.5 hours, so we took a walk for an hour, and came back to find out that we were no longer on the list. Partly our fault, but maybe they can implement a more efficient system.

So its 8:45 in the morning, the stomach a rumbling as a night of drinking let nothing but water and alcohol metabolize in me for the last 12 hours. Eggs and bacon needed FAST! So we went up the escalator and into the packed waiting room of this 24\/7 diner. Nothing out of the ordinary in Vegas and with a 20 minute wait my friend and I learned how to kill some time.

Coming back however we ended up being 25 minutes where as we missed my name and waited no more than 2 minutes to be seated. The host at the time was very respectful of our wait and let us pass to get us to a booth. Sitting down, we were greeted by a more than happy waitress, taking our water orders and having us sit. 

DISCLAIMER: Don't break the rules here. My friend and I saw a few buddies and wandered off to their seats however were promptly warned that the plates were too larger to fit 6 in a table meant for 4 people. 

Being escorted back to our seats we ordered our food and drinks, myself sticking with the Huckleberry Sin and The Basic (three eggs any style, toast\/biscuit, homemade jam, bacon and fruit). The meal itself was great, the portion being huge to where I could not finish it, but savoring every flavorful bite. The strawberry jam being the icing on the cake as it was fresh and complimented everything. The Sin was just as good, a mixture of berry with not too much natural sweet taste and something that will get you a good buzz for $9.99. 

Now we had about an hour wait for a food which knocks this place down a star to me, from start to finish being here for about an hour and a half, 60 minutes for food alone. I understand its a busy diner but more staff, better chefs preparing the food, or better time constraints can give them more customers. Otherwise than that the experience was great, the overly friendly waiter we got switched to keeping it legitimate with his drink choices and informing us not to get the $8 hourly shot with souvenir mug. Apparently not worth it.

I went back the following day for breakfast and what a different experience - great service....and the eggs benedicts and BLT Bloddy Mary were delicious.

GOOD:
* SAGE FRIED CHICKEN WITH STACKED BACON WAFFLES (17):
   - You can taste the sage in the fried chicken and is best if you include a bite of the fried leeks that they scatter around the plate. The waffles are nice and thick with strips of bacon layered inside. Not like other places where they chop the bacon into bits and mix it into the batter. The only downer is that the waffles are a bit limp and has lost any ""crunch"" to the exterior. Which I have learned through America's Text Kitchen is because there is too much moister in the batter or maybe the steam from the bacon did it. For the price and the size its a nice brunch that will tide you over till dinner or snack time, which ever comes first.

OKAY:
* its hard to get to this place because it is inside Imperial Palace, which is undergoing a renovation.
* if you are slow to wake-up, then be ready to get more rest as you wait for a table to open up. They don't have enough staff for the number of customers who want in.",0,0,0

My friend and I shared the sage fried chicken eggs benedict and the vegetable hash. First, as you probably know from other reviews, the portions are GINORMOUS! We definitely could have shared one entree and been fine. 

We waited about 45 minutes for a table, but it was nice because we could wander around the Linq and come back closer to the time. The wait time they quoted was pretty accurate. 

I will say that, overall, the hash was a miss for me. I found that rather ironic because the name of the restaurant has hash in its name. The hash itself was bland and underwhelming. It tasted like there was no seasoning on it. I was not a fan. The one redeeming quality of this dish was that the over medium eggs on too were cooked to perfection!

On the other hand, the sage fried chicken eggs benedict was delicious!!! The only miss was that the eggs were overcooked; they were cooked through and not runny at all. However, the chicken itself was perfectly fried and well seasoned. It was just the right amount of crispy; mouthwateringly delicious! I also loved the biscuits! They tasted homemade, a bit crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Everything together with the sauce was heavenly. I couldn't stop eating it!

The television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  The first time I saw them on television, the portions were huge (think Cheesecake Factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to Vegas.

My friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having Hash House for Sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  As we made our way to Imperial Palace, I was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  After parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards Hash House.

I was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  After a few more shots, I glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of french toast.  My fried ordered some variation of eggs Benedict.  The food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.

The french toast arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the Food Network.  The french toast were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The french toast were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting french toast I've ever had.  In addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.

Hash House A Go Go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  My friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  If I had to compare Hash House A Go Go to something it would be The Cheesecake Factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  Oh Hash House A Go Go, how I miss you.",1,0,1

We also ordered the Strawberry Lemonade and fries.  I didn't care for the lemonade but the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was amazeballs and by far the best fries anywhere.  The chicken benny was a crazy concoction of biscuits, fried chicken, scrambled eggs (which were not a good addition), melted cheese, tomatoes, some spinach thrown in for good measure and a spicy (not hot, just a nice warmth) Benedict sauce.  My chicken was a tad overcooked so it was a bit like jerky on parts of it.

I guess I got some type of burger(guess because all that was left in the to go box was half of each bun).  My wife had chicken and waffles and believes they were good.  We know this was ordered due to left overs.  The chicken I can say was good because I finished it the next day recovering from a hangover. After thinking more about it I'm thankful the staff didn't call the authorities or we may have ended up in detox.  A couple days later we walked by and took a sober look at things and they look to be good. A solid 4 star for not having us arrested and put in the drunk tank.

On one trip, I had the HH Famous Meatloaf Hash and my wife ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  Both were pretty good.   The meatloaf wasn't the juiciest meatloaf, but had a good taste.   The chipotle sauce for the benedict was yummy.  

More recently, I went with my wife and a couple of friends.  The table shared a blueberry, pecan, brown sugar pancake, 2 orders of the pork tenderloin benedict, and a quesadilla.   

The pancake was sweet, soft but not undercooked, and ginormous.  I really don't know how one person can put that platter of fluffyness down themselves.  

The pork tenderloin was breaded and fried to a nice crispness but I think I would have been happy with a big slab of un-breaded\/fried pork.  Perhaps I would have appreciated the fried-ness if I were hungover.  :)

I only had a bite of the quesadilla and I remember it being very quesadilicious.

I ordered the chicken rosemary house which had asparagus and served with roasted potatos. You are also offered eggs which I got scrambled and were fluffy and delicious. It is also served with either toast or biscuit the size of a baseball. My friends had egg white scramble with pesto, and the other friend had the friend chicken benedict. The fried chicken benedict was huge! I also had a sip of their bloody mary and it was delicious, and i dont even like bloody marys.

During Vegas' busy seasons, you might find yourself waiting 30+ mins to get a table depending on how big your party is. But trust me, it's worth it! 

Their hashes are delicious & come in huge portions! I always get the fresh mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash. The potatoes come diced and crispy seasoned to perfection. The biscuit that comes along with it is whatever's to me, I'm all about the potatoes + eggs. The eggs come scrambled and almost have a buttery flavor to me. They aren't as seasoned as the potatoes but I like that I can add salt + pepper to my liking. 

All the food here is hearty and big portioned so it's a great place to eat to prepare for all that drinking. 
If you do visit, be sure to try their Bloody Mary! It's one of my favorites in Vegas, comparable to the one served at Guy Fieri's. It's not too spicy to enjoy but has just the right amount of kick to it. 

Prices are what you would expect to pay in Vegas, so $$$ but considering you'll most likely leave with leftovers, it's like purchasing two meals for the price of one. Service here is always great!",0,0,0

Well, that's what I thought was going to happen here. I am very happy to say my expectations were not only met, but exceeded. 

First off, this place is suuuuper popular so if you don't get here early (or late) expect to wait a very very long time for a table. Unless you're a high ranking Total Rewards member & can bypass the wait time. I'd become a member just for this perk alone!

Food here is all amazing and in huge portions. Everything on the menu is easily shareable between two or more people. Keep that in mind. Don't let your stomach tell your brain it can finish anything you order. Chances are...you can't.

Now, the reason why I came here is because everyone raves about the chicken & waffles. I love me some Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles so I had to try these. I knew I was going to get a more gourmet meal than Roscoe's, but that's fine. Let me tell you...my food life has changed. The chicken was amazing. Juicy center, crispy outside..and with some amazing seasonings. This was easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. The menu said the waffles were bacon waffles so I was expecting waffles with little flecks of bacon. What I got was a waffle with several entire strips of back down the middle. It was heavenly! Only issue is that this is all stacked so high & on a somewhat small plate so once you break it down to eat, plate space becomes in high demand. I couldn't avoid spilling things onto the table (sorry cleaners!) But oh man was this one of the best dishes I've ever had for brunch. And no...I couldn't finish it. And I did everything I could to do so.

So yes, my experience at Hash House was excellent. And I will be back as often as I can.",1,1,1

The Andy's Sage Fried You must, must try the Chicken with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuits (15.95). The chicken was good, maybe a little dry. The scrambled eggs were sooo fluffy. One of the best eggs i've had. The bacon mashed potatoes is just delicious and solid. The bacon did just the trick. The biscuits were sooo yummy. My friends get some butter and the peach jam to put on the biscuits. SOOO GREAT! Such a good price and great portion! My friend's food portions were very generous too.

The wait was ridiculous...but luckily they have a bloody mary bar for $9. That helped but the alcohol soaked in quick as I was super hungry.
My friends and I ordered 3 dishes.
1. The popular fried chicken and waffles - this was very big and I liked the waffles, but  other than that I did not really find it to be awesome. The sage in the chicken is interesting and I guess that makes it special. The chicken was soft and not dry.
2. Fried chicken benedict - this one was okay. Lots of cheese and I'm sad the egg was not poached, it was scrambled. Definitely did not stand out to me though.
3. The salmon scramble with pesto, brie, and some other items. This one was good, I liked the scramble, though I was so full from trying all the other dishes I could barely finish this. The biscuit is very good too, like an oversized KFC biscuit. The potatoes it came with were okay.

Overall, this place was good for a one time thing, I wouldn't really go back just b\/c the wait is long, and the space is annoying b\/c people are walking EVERYWHERE.

After an 8 mile spartan race, this was the PERFECT meal to reenergize. The chicken was so delicious and moist. The eggs underneath were so tasty. The melted cheese was my absolute favorite part. And the mashed potatoes were soo good. They also had somewhat of an enchilada sauce drizzled around the side of the plate, which was a good little addition. Mix everything together, with a touch of the sauce, and you've got yourself one of the most tasteful things ever. The plate was HUGE. Even being from Texas, where portions are always big, I was very surprised by how large this meal was. Any place where I can't finish the whole plate (and I eat ALOT) has my 5 star vote.

For breakfast (actually dinner, as this place is open 24\/7) I had the corned beef hash. Which is shredded corned beef (not the canned), potatoes (diced and spiced with flakes from Heaven), and then churned in cheese. It also comes with two eggs of your choice, some asparagus (because why not), and some fruit. This mammoth of breakfast is served in a cast iron skillet. Again, I only got about halfway through, as my stomach screamed from being stuffed. 
My boyfriend got the sage chicken benedict, and the plate that was brought out could have served a family of four. Two pieces of breaded Godzilla chicken drenched in sauce, and layered on spinach, tomato, smoked bacon, and then placed on a sea of potatoes. God bless him for trying, but he too succumbed to his stomach pleading for mercy. 
Seriously, come HUNGRY! Or, like we said we would do next time, split something. Our bill was on $50.00, which may sound like a lot, but you certainly get what you pay for!",0,0,0

We've been twice now - once before the Imperial Palace became the Quad, and once since the Casino has switched to the Quad. Now, it is nearly impossible to find, down deep, dark alleyways, passed the very cramped concierge desk, down some steps. I'm sure the management at Hash House is not too impressed with this... but it has lead to a much shorter wait time! 

Come hungry and in your Thanksgiving Day fat pants. Don't come if you ""could eat, but not that hungry"" or if you plan on hitting the pool later.  I had the Andy's Sage Fried Eggs Benedict. It's bigger than an NFL football, swear to God. Inch thick layer of real mashed potatoes, two ginormous biscuits, a full chicken breast fried to perfection, a layer of eggs, some spinach, another layer of cheese, then topped off with the most sinful chipotle hollandaise sauce. Now, I'm a 5'8, 130 lbs girl but I can eat, that's for sure. I put this plate to shame and left with half a biscuit on my plate - drawing quite the praise and congratulations from our server who was thoroughly impressed. 

This restaurant is more of a spectator sport. Dishes are brought out when they are done, they don't use heat lamps so if you have a large crowd, some people will be left without a plate until their meal is done. In the mean time, you gawk at everyone else's ridiculous amount of food and at those who are stuffing their faces.

The portions here are out of control. It doesn't matter what you order, each order can feed 2-4 people. But despite this, I always like ordering my own entree because that means I'll have leftovers for drunken munchies post-clubbing. 

A few of my favorite things here: 
-Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (under the Indiana Favorites of the breakfast menu)
-Any of the flavored flapjacks
-French Toast
-Famous Sausage (under the Indiana Favorites of the breakfast menu)
-Roasted Chicken House Hash.

If there's a must get for me every time I'm here, it's the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. Not too sweet, not too tart, not too tangy... just right! And the thick, giant watermelon slice to garnish the drink is the icing on the cake. Don't leave HHaGG without ordering this!!

We were shocked and instantly realized that his place was a must while we were in Vegas.  Unfortunately, we couldn't wait in time, our bellies were screaming for grease.  We ate somewhere else that day but on our last day in Vegas we came back to wait the line and get our grub on.  The line was about 25 minutes which wasn't too bad.

I ordered the corned beef skillet which came with potatoes, fruit, biscuit, corned beef and 2 fried eggs.  The biscuit with the home made strawberry jam was amazing.

This was the first place I ate at when I arrived in Vegas this trip. It's located on the second floor across the entrance of the Linq. 

I came in a group of 3 and we ordered two dishes because we passed by a few tables and the portions were huge. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken pot pie. It also came with large biscuits with a honey, caramel, butterscotch sauce. The chicken and waffles were okay. The chicken was good and moist. The waffles were whatever. The chicken pot pie was a huge no-no. It wasn't even a pie. It was a hard piece of thick crust with a creamy potato, veggie, and chicken mix. It was sooooo bland and not chicken pot pie. 

Onto the service.. first off, it took forever for someone to greet us at our table. After our server dropped off our drinks, she walks away but we were ready to order. Uhhh? So we had to grab her attention. Second issue, we told her that the chicken pot pie was bland (we hardly touched it) and she goes ""You should've told me in the beginning, I bring it back to our manager"" and grabs the plate and takes it back to the kitchen. Excuse me, ""we should've told you in the beginning?"" Are we supposed to take a bite as soon as you drop it off and let you know if we don't like it there and then? My group and I are all servers and we'd NEVER say that to a customer. And our server NEVER came by to check on us and I had to flag her down to tell her about the dish. 

10-15 minutes after she takes away the dish, the manager comes by with the check and drops it off without say ANYTHING. They took off half the dish and on the receipt, it said ""ATE CHICKEN."" What does that mean? I ate all the meat and gave it back to you? I was so pissed off at that point and we left no tip. That other half of the dish that they should've taken off should've been your tip, but whatever.",1,3,0

Food: GIANT portions. You should know that going in. Accept it and perhaps plan ahead to cut the plate in half, or maybe even in thirds.  I just had the chicken salad sandwich, so when it came out, I cut it in half; ate one half and took the other half home, which made great left overs.  It's definitely enough to share with two or three people.

I disagree with some of the reviews below. The food is good and very flavorful. It's greasy Midwestern food but not gross greasy.  Like I said, I had the chicken salad sandwich; it came with some delicious cucumbers and fries. The fries were seasoned just right and weren't too hard or crispy.

The place itself is nice, Americana midwest themed.  This location also has a great view of Las Vegas.  Once the weather warms up again it will be nice to eat on the terrace and enjoy the view.  We went on a Saturday afternoon -- around 4:30pm -- and there was zero line. (The Sahara location does have a longer wait.)  I didn't find the staff rude at all. They were very attentive and nice, and food came out quick.

It's not in the nicest hotel\/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.

We got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. 

We had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. 

I got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.

The best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. 

The only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!",8,3,7

I read most of the Yelp review for this restaurant and knew I had to have breakfast here during my stay in Vegas

It was worth the walk from the Elara. 

Our waiter was good too. He opened with a warning that many of the servings are large portions (so says Yelpers too). I asked about the hash and was told it was a house specialty. The restaurant pulls fresh corned beef and cooks it in a skillet. That with two pouched eggs made for a wonderful breakfast . 

The interior is a blend of stainless and glass. It reminds me of the old dinners I used to frequent in upstate NY. 

My cappuccino was ok, not their best. I'm told the brewed coffee here is really good. Next time. 

The plate was served with a big ole biscuit and fresh strawberry jam. That was nice.

At first, I was really concerned that at 4:30 in the afternoon, the hostess told me it was a 45 minute wait.   A couple of groups before me got on the list and then decided to head on down to the casino for 20-30 minutes of gambling while they waited.   Great plan... right?   Nope.   I thought I would just chill for a bit and play games on my phone.   Much to my surprise, my name was called about 5-6 minutes later.   Apparently... EVERYONE ahead of me thought they would go down to the casino and weren't there when it was their turn.   Woo-hooo!!   

This time I ventured into the world of the dinner menu.   I love love love my breakfast foods, but I'm in Vegas and this is my way of gambling as a warmup to the real gambling (*wink*).   I gave the #2 Stuffed Burger a go go (Pepper Jack, Guac, wax pepper, jalapeno, bacon, and queso cheese).  Good golly miss Molly... this was a big ol' burger with n elbow dripping mess about to happen.   If you are a dainty eater... stay clear of this bad boy.   Thankfully... I'm not a dainty eater.   I dove into this beast and trembled as the sheer joy of gluttony washed over me.   Dude... this was a beast of a burger and would have been worth the 45 minutes that I didn't have to wait.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends. It was my first time trying this place. I do remember it being featured on Man vs. Food. Located in the second floor of the Linq hotel, there was a 25 minute wait to an hour, but managed to get seated within a half hour or so. Until then, we used that time to take a look at the menu, so that by the time we were seated and served, we'd know what we wanted to order.

Since we were super hungry, it was a tough decision to make since there was such a variety of food entrees to choose from, whether you're craving something hearty to the more smaller and healthier  portions. I decided to order the HH Original. The dish featured a sweet but large helping of bacom mashed potatoes topped with two biscuits, two slices of thick bacon, tomato slices, spinach, and over easy eggs smothered in red, hot chipotle sauce.

Oh. My. God. First of all, the portion size was quite enormous. The size of these entrees are enough to keep you full the rest of the day. All that was left after I finished was a piece of biscuit. It was soooo worth the wait! The coffee to top it all off with was nice and fresh :)

Our server, Tawney,  was outstanding! She was super friendly and was excited aboout providing us with the best service possible, and she stuck to it. She happily shared past experiences of seeing people's reactions to the portion sizes, and also kept making sure our food arrived at our table in a promptly and timley manner. Such a wonderful experience for our first time here. The next time I want to come back to Vegas and crave for some good morning eats, Hash House A Go Go at The Linq is the place to go :)",0,0,0

The giant BLT -Bloody Mary - served with a big slice of tomato, toast, lettuce and mayo - well wife said it best ""This is so decadent!"" But then again it does have fruits and vegetables so how can it be decadent? 

Ok - the food just arrived - I think I might be afraid! Ha! The sage fried chicken and eggs dwarfs the plate - an awesome display of foodie-gasm! Hidden amongst the expansive Uber chicken steak was bacon - crispy but not over cooked.  Oh yes and a medley of hash brown potato.

Nestled in the plate - strawberry jam - taste like grandma's!

Wife had salad - I think there is 10 pounds of it! Displayed with a lovely biscuit and cucumber dressing - absolutely a delicious and healthy offering!  Oh yes - the salad included fried corn bread croutons - I am loving this meal.

I had been wanting to come to this place for sooooooo long, like back when there was only one. Finally I got my chance, while my Aunt & Uncle were visiting. We showed up on a Sunday, around brunch time I guess. The place was understandably busy & we ended up waiting about 45 minutes to be seated, not too bad. However, once we were seated, it took a little while before a server showed up. 

Once our order was taken, it took about another 45 minutes before my Aunt & Uncle's food showed up. Where was mine? I figured it might be out next, seeing as how these are not your normal sized meals. So, after about 10-15 minutes & still no food, I finally flagged down my server & asked for my food. He replied that it would be out shortly that there had been a mistake. Shortly after, a Manager came out & apologized & said that my meal would be taken off of the ticket. Personally, I think when something like that happens, the whole ticket should be comped, because it is an inconvenience to everyone.  Just saying. 

I finally received my order, Griddled French Toast & freshly squeezed tangerine juice. I would probably go so far as to say that it was well worth the wait :P For as huge as this meal was, it was definitely no match for me, because by that time I was super hungry!! 

All I know is, that aside from the service, for that day anyways, the food was GREAT!! The french toast, tangerine juice & the homemade strawberry preserves are ridiculously good!! You really can't bet the portions either, so definitely come hungry or be prepared to share.

Our waitress was great, a little mix up with splitting the bill at the end, but was quickly resolved, mistakes happen, and it was a bit confusing. 

Ok, to those who rated it so horribly, besides having bad service, our waitress informed us that the wait for our food would be longer than usual because they don't have microwaves or pre-made items, or heat lamps. Therefore the food you receive is fresh and all our food was served HOT. I would gladly wait longer for fresh food than Denny's or McDonalds pre-made items. 

This place is known for it's portion size. SOOO for people to judge harshly on having huge portions is ridiculous! When the Hash House was on Man V. Food it showed the huge portions, so don't complain especially when the price is not expensive for being in Las Vegas!!!

I have eaten at many places on the strip and this by far is one of the best, because of the portions for the price. I had the stuffed burger with avocado, bacon and cheese and their side house salad.

Coffee - decent
Some coffee pistachio drink - amazing
A pineapple mimosa - strong and delicious 
Soda - not flat so two thumbs up there
Corned beef hash skillet which came with a large biscuit and fruit- tiring after awhile
Crispy Cornmeal Salmon Sandwich - this was plated beautifully with sriracha\/mayo sauce  drizzled around the sandwich

Prices are about the same as at grand lux or most other sit down places on the strip at like $13ish for breakfast type items. I got the corned beef hash and was surprised when it was shredded corn beef instead of ground which I thought was nice. I got scrambled eggs with them and they were very bland so I wasn't a fan. The potatoes were decent being homestyle fries style with the corned beef and cheese on top. They give you a biscuit which sucks, hard as a rock and bland and dry, we ended up taking them and threw them at our friend while wandering the strip. Everything comes with a stalk of rosemary stuck in it which looks tacky in my opinion, but whatever they think is cool. Other than the food being pretty bland, the portions were large and served in cast iron skillets which was cool and nice. Our waiter was a d-bag and made the experience even worse. He was never around, and the only time we saw him was when we ordered and when our food came, and when he brought us the check. When he brought us our food, he asked us how everything tasted, which how do we know since we just got the food?!?!  And then we didn't see him again till he brought us the bill

We were walking the strip when we ran into a friend of mine waiting outside of Imperial Palace. He was waiting for a friend to meet him for lunch at Hash House and was told it had really good reviews. I blame him!

Later that day on our search for food, the boyfriend mentioned he wanted to try this place out since he's never had chicken and waffles. We meandered into Imperial Palace looking for this place for a good 15 minutes before we decided to give up. On our last night, for whatever godforsaken reason, we decided to attempt to find this place again. Success!

The complimentary biscuits were delish. Huge, but delish. The pre-glazed honey on top just made it that much more heavenly. 

We ordered chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The portions were so huge we just shared the chicken & waffles, leaving the country fried steak untouched (and for whatever reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to take it to go, knowing very well we were leaving at 7am the next morning). Prior to ordering we had asked the waiter how big the portions were and if he thought we'd be able to share. He recommended 2 portions just in case we were really hungry. Now, knwoing how ginormous the portions were and looking at the size of the two of us, you'd think he would've recommmended one portion only, but whatevs. The chicken and waffle was satisfactory. It's much preferred over Roscoes in my opinion (not a fan of soggy waffles). But I guess I'm not a chicken and waffles kind of gal. 

Honestly my review may be a little skewed in retrospect. If this were anywhere other than Vegas, I probably would've given this place at least 3 stars. I'm keeping it at two since the boyfriend seemed to hate it so much. If you're going to Vegas to party and gamble, I guess this is a must eat stop. Our trip was more to experience the grandeur of Vegas, so I'm sticking with my 2 stars.",0,0,0

Sunday morning is king of breakfast time folks and we should know that!!! So after about a 20 minute wait (take your time to peruse the menu and read all the autographed stars menus on the wall!) we seat a table of 6 armed with a feeding strategy!!!!

We all decided to share.....not much of a unique strategy, but one that the regular patron will be wise to heed!  Portion size is OUTTA CONTROL and depending on the size of your stomach this can be a good thing or an amazing trip to a food coma.  Nonetheless, sharing a plate for two will definitely be your best option.  In all we ordered 3 plates for 6 guests including the Man VS. Food favorite of the Chicken and Waffles, the Sage-Fried Chicken with maple reduction and the Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  

You don't need a blow by blow to know that the combinations of flavors and ingredients are a HOMERUN!  The sage is added into the batter and fried topped with the sweet and warm maple reduction......just luscious heaven.  Anyone who revels in savory and sweet will need to taste this dish!!  Growing up in the south this flavor profile is MANDATORY!!
The chipotle cream flowing above over easy eggs and crispy fried chicken cutlets is like a culinary homage to Niagara Falls!  Mildly spicy and yet smooth all the way folks.
The waffles are pillowy softness of a vessel to load up mashed potatoes and chicken topped with more maple syrup!  MAPLE SYRUP ON EVERYTHING!!  Ok, maybe not everything, but definitely the chicken.  If you venture to try any of the flapjacks, be brave because those things can be worn as capes!  Seriously, I saw a table of 4 big fellas next to us all order flapjacks and they all gave up halfway through.  REMEMBER!!  YOU MUST SHARE THESE PLATES!

As far as the ambiance it's a laid back, casual atmosphere, no seriousness necessary and you can come on in at anytime of the day as they are open 24hrs.  The wait staff was accommodating and friendly so no problems there.  Whether Vegas has you up or down, the Hash House will get you the GO-GO.

This is great for the person who loves breakfast food no matter what time of a day it is. The Corn Beef and Hash is my all time favorite. They give you a large portion of corn beef with potatoes two eggs (style of your choosing) and a biscuit. The corn beef is never extremely greasy the way a lot of other places make theirs. It's always delicious.  

Another one of my favorites is the banana pancake. It's a giant pancake with bananas cooked into it as a posed to just sitting on top. Also very delicious and a great size for sharing. 

My only negative is that during some parts of the day there is a long wait and the last time I went two employees were arguing in from of the hostess station (a little unprofessional).

We agreed that both dishes were tasty but the chicken and biscuits was the winner hands down. In fact it was so tasty we decided then and there to round up the other 8 people in our group to return for breakfast the next morning for biscuits and gravy . Hubby and I nibbled slowly because we just knew that chicken and waffles plate would show up any minute now. Little did we know it wouldn't make an appearance for nearly 30 more minutes.  

We arrived together, ordered together, and ended up with two of us sitting back watching our friend eat his dinner while we twiddled our thumbs. That's just not the way I like to spend an evening dining out. After the raves and comparisons to Roscoes. the fact that he found the chicken to be edible but nothing special just put an extra twist on the knife of disappointment.

The Hash House has huge plates at really good prices and the presentation is very impressive, especially considering the price.

I'm a little more of a bitch than most when it comes to food because I have a pretty bad Gluten sensitivity (Celiac Disease) and most places are out of the question due to factors like cross-contamination and more simply menu selection.

I have to say that finding the place wasn't easy, because phone navigation doesn't say that it's located inside a casino. We made the choice of going into the casino as a short cut and ran into the restaurant by mistake (even tho it was our intended location). 

The food was amazing, it tastes exactly as expected and the size portions are HUGE. I would recommend sharing a plate with someone. 

We got the hot chocolate and it was too big, I wouldn't suggest getting it. It tastes fine, but it was too much to drink and while still having to eat all the food. I would stick to the water. We ordered the chicken waffles plate, the Benedict chicken plate, sweet potato fries, and the banana flapjack pancakes.

As per other reviews, portions are very large. After looking at the menus (and a few pics on Yelp) I ordered the sage chicken, eggs and mashed potatoes. My friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash. Overall service was good, attentive and prompt. Environment is unique with checkered chrome metal on the walls and comfortable booths. 

I didn't taste hers so all I can say is she liked it. Nice large strips of corned beef hash over potatoes with some gravy. She ordered hot tea and it came in a rather unique tea bag. 

I ordered the Andys Sage Chicken, Eggs and Mashed Potatoes along with coffee. The chicken is breaded and deep fried. Mashed potatoes have bacon in them. Eggs were over easy and there was also two strips of bacon. The eggs were a bit overcooked but still slightly runny. The chicken left a lot to be desired, tasteless and bland. The breading added nothing to the flavor and was too thick for my preference. Bacon also wasn't very tasty. The mashed potatoes were ok but there's a lot. There was a raspberry drizzle around the outside of the plate that proceeded to make everything I touched sticky. Not a big fan.

Overall I'd call it a disappointing visit from my perspective. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles but wasn't a big fan of how it was presented after looking at the pics on Yelp.",0,1,0

I was immediately disappointed with the look and feel of the place. It is not as cute or kitschy as one in SD, and actually feel like a giant cafeteria. It occurred to me during my meal that I've been to this space before when it was the Imperial Palace Buffett.. and it still feels\/looks like exactly like it. Hence, the cafeteria ambiance. 

The service was good and food was still good although my friend said his chicken benedict was lacking something from the SD version but he couldn't quite place it. My sausage gravy biscuits were good but I was a little annoyed because they had bell peppers all over the top when the menu didn't say it had them.. also my gravy was only lukewarm which was a bit of turnoff. The food is usually served hot with hot plates at the SD location.  Ugh.. 

Not sure if I'd come back to this location.. think I'll reserve my HHAGOGO cravings for the SD location. ;-) 

Note: The IP is being converted to a new hotel, The Quad so you have to walk thru a maze of construction to get to the HHAGOGO. It's a little annoying but not as bad as it seems.",2,0,1

I have this terrible habit of waiting until the very last minute to eat anything and therefore, I get insanely grumpy as my stomach starts to growl and hurt and all I want to do is eat something. Only problem is, even though it's Vegas and the place never really shuts down, it's still hard to find something to nosh on that doesn't cost an exorbitant amount of cash, or is even really open (and no, I will not eat Denny's way up by the Rivera- It's gross and the walk is ridiculous).

""Ever heard of Hash House A Go Go?"" my buddy asks me as we stand by the Bellagio fountains, sweating in the humid air, my temper already on a very short fuse cuz I'm sure not even orphans in war torn Africa are as hungry as I am at that moment in time.

""Nope,"" I reply. ""But as long as it isn't pizza or somewhere far, I'll give it a shot.""

We cross over to the Quad (which is actually pretty nice now that it's been remodeled and doesn't reek of pure tackiness) and, there at the top of the escalators, we walk into the place. Yes, I said ""walk-in"", as in we didn't have to wait in these really long lines everyone is complaining about on here. Maybe it's because it was mid-week and early in the morning, I have no idea, but those long wait times were non-existent.

Like others, I don't really get the whole ambiance of the place. Is it industrial? Is it retro? Is it some weird steam-punk amalgamation? Whatever it is, it doesn't really work. The various pictures on the wall (I seem to remember cowboys and burgers- but then again, I think I was a little drunk), just don't seem to mesh with the metal and the gray paint. But whatever, I was there to eat, not be an interior critic.

How long do you think for us to be seen by our waitress? 30 minutes? 40? Neither of those. Honestly, I would wager it was all of about 5 minutes or so before our waitress was at our table, asking for our orders. Hell, we had barely even begun to look at the menu. In fact, I was a little to preoccupied with the waitress herself, who was looking really good with her tattoos and nice smile. Her helpfulness was also pretty alluring.

Now, speaking of the menu, which is really what this whole thing is about isn't it? It's not especially big, by which I mean there wasn't a huge selection to chose from. The place brands itself as a breakfast joint, and they have a decent amount of offerings in that department, but I was more interested in something a little more traditional. I picked the burger and only after I made that decision did I realize it had mashed potatoes on it. Mashed potatoes? On a burger? What the hell? Well, I was in Vegas and it was late, and I was hungry, and I had to live a little, so I went with it. Plus, the waitress (who's name I can't remember, although I wanna say it was Gia, or something like that) had been so nice and I didn't want to make her hate me. My buddy, also drunk and clearly feeling the effects of drunk hunger, ordered the chicken and waffles on the suggestion of our server. She said it was good and what most people ordered. She also said the portions were huge.

When she said huge, she meant it. My burger came and I swear to God the thing stood like 8 inches tall. So much meat and toppings crammed in it. Yes, those mashed potatoes took up some of that space and I debated scratching them off with a knife, but they must have put those potatoes in there for a reason, right? I went ahead and just dove right in, tastes be damned. I can say that whoever made the decision to put those fluffy, white, mashed roots on a hunk of beef is a culinary genius and deserves an award. Simply put, my burger was delicious. I couldn't even finish all of it in one sitting, however I was able to take it back to the hotel and eat the rest of it for lunch the next day. It was almost like a whole new meal. As far as the chicken and waffles went, those too, should win some type of prize. They came pilled up on a plate in some kind of pyramid like stack, ready for consumption.  Oh, and those waffles had bacon in them. Yes, tasty, salty, crunchy, glorious bacon, mixed into the batter! 

Would I recommend this place? Yes!
Would I return? That would be a resounding Hell Yes!",1,0,0

Overall the meal was pretty good but I would have liked my chicken breast fried a little more crispy! I had a wonderful virgin watermelon kiwi drink. After adding a packet of sugar it was good. I ended up getting the drink in the souvenir glass for $12.00. We visited around noon but next time we will visit after 5:00 pm so that we can try their homemade honey butter biscuits that are only served in the evenings. Whenever I am in Vegas I will visit again.",1,0,1

We got here at around 8-ish on a Saturday morning; and the wait was already about 30mins.

It's like... ""c'mon people...aren't you all supposed to be dead tired on your beds from partying last night?"" --No.. not the case.. apparently.. there are a lot of breakfast enthusiasts that actually do come on breakfast time (They do serve their menu all day...24\/7 okay)...

Cory and I got seated on a little booth by the bar on the left. Even my tall husband said the table was too high. Let's just say it wasn't too ergonomic for eating.
Our server's name was: Sassy..... She got our drink orders and Cory and I already knew what our orders were even before being seated.. so we gave that to Sassy too....

What i like about Hash house is that... It doesn't have a cellphone network coverage for AT&T!!! And it didn't seem like they had wi-fi either.

So pretty much all my check-ins and foodie Instagram photos had to wait....
But I liked how Cory and I got to spend the whole breakfast date...Phone less... How liberating. I was a bit on edge.. but it was awesome. We played with straw wrappers; we checked each other's noses for boogers... we made faces at each other. Yes.. lots of things you can do while waiting for your order.

Anyway...

My gigantic SAGE CHICKEN AND BACON WAFFLES walked over to the table (like seriously, it covered Sassy's head while she was walking towards our table).... and man was it seriously massive. My jaw dropped and I instantly gained 5 lbs after it was placed on our table.
Let's just say that It was a different taste of Chicken and a different taste of Waffle.
The chicken is deep fried and breaded but with a hint of herb. It lingered in aroma that at one point; i thought i was eating a grilled chicken breast. Ha! Not.
The Bacon Waffle completely took me over the edge.They weren't little bits of bacon okay. There were huge pieces of bacon embedded in that waffle. 
The plate came with two JUMBO pieces of chicken; and 4 jumbo pieces of waffle. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.

Cory got the SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT.... Oh dear lord.. that hollandaise that covered the whole plate? it looked like it was whisked into butter submission goodness perfection.
Rich.Good.. Yummy.. Fried Chicken yummy.. give it to me. I personally liked his better than mine. 
And once again.. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.

Highly Recommend to those seeking comfort food that can compensate bad hangovers.

I gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if i liked the taste of the food itself; or if i was just overwhelmed with their extraordinary way of plating. I mean.. my two chickens were atop each other on a stack of waffles secured with a huge steak knife.
I'd have to give this another shot again and try simpler items on the menu to break down their food artistry and concentrate on their flavors.

Both our orders plus a little banana Latte was close to $50.00++. So... it could get pricey for two people..",2,2,0

Arrived at Hash House at the Linq and asked for a table for 4 and waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning. Typical wait time since it is a busy place. We sat down and ordered our food and when the waiter left, I looked at my watch to see that it was about 9:00am. We saw about two other tables get seated maybe 10-15 minutes after us with the same amount of people. About 30-40 minutes later, we saw that the other two tables who got seated after us got served their food before us. It was about the same type of food (eggs benedict) that we ordered at our table so we knew the type of food we ordered wasn't taking longer than others. We kept trying to flag our waiter down and he would quickly come by and say, ""Your food will be out shortly"" but wouldn't let us get a word in and leave the table right away. He did this several times. A friend and I went to the manager at about 9:45 and told him the situation. The manager replied back, ""So are you going to eat your food or leave?"" He didn't even apologize or say he'll go check on the food first but instead just asked if we were gonna leave like he didn't care.  Finally, our food came out 10 minutes later and we waited for the manager to come back before eating the food. He told us that he will give us 25% off and sorry for the delay but that they are always busy on Saturday mornings. The waiter came by shortly afterwards and said that he put the order in right after we ordered at 9:15am and said that it wasn't his fault that the food came out late. Basically, both the manager and waiter did not care and just blamed it on the busy morning even though two tables got served before we did.

-'s: Hype. Poor service. Noise. 
+'s: Extremely large portions  

To put review in context, I was a server for over 11 years, my mother had a catering company, and we were not ""doing the Vegas thing"" meaning we were neither hung over nor drinking prior to the drinks ordered in this post.

I've wanted to visit this place since I saw the Man vs. Food episode many years ago. So disappointing. It is incredibly noisy and crowded. My husband used his earplugs to handle the din. We had a 45 minute wait. We stood at the bar for a Bloody Mary to pass the time, waited 10 minutes before borrowing the menu from the folks next to us, and were noticed 15 minutes later, went with the bartender suggested upgrade on the vodka for $2 more for a total tab of $26. Rough start, but still hopeful. 

Upon sitting, I noticed place setting had a dirty spoon that I ignored, knowing that sometimes dishwashers miss things. After about 10 minutes, our server took our order...Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict, OJ, coffee, side of ""bacon, bacon, bacon"" and another Bloody Mary. Drinks took a while; I had to ask three times to two different servers for milk for my coffee. Bacon ordered as an appetizer came with the entree, which is probably on us for not stressing that we wanted it earlier. We had to ask two different staff again for side plates so that we could share the dish. Although the presentation was photo worthy in terms of sheer size, our food was barely lukewarm. The tomato slices were a faint red; there were a few sprinkled raw spinach leaves, the equivalent of a single scrambled egg, and a large, but dry chicken breast. The mashed potatoes under the tower of calories were roughly mashed with large chunks of potatoes and very little seasoning. On the bright side, the portion was huge and easily split by two. 

And here's the rub... the server brought back a boxed glass like the one the third Bloody Mary was served in; I stopped him and said that we hadn't ordered the glass, and he explained that it came with the drink. (Although the very same drinks at the bar did not come with a glass.) Looked at the bill and found that the upgrade in vodka this time raised the drink price to $21.99. I wanted to dispute the charge, but the husband was done and really didn't want to wait around for the server any longer. I felt that the ""upsell"" was dishonest and very much a swindle.

Be careful when ordering drinks and double check what you are charged. The servers, runners, bussers, etc were all pleasant enough...they were just unable to handle the volume and activity the day we were there. But we will not be going back to see if this was a fluke.",0,0,0

The restaurant itself looks a little drab and old, like there used to be a previous restaurant residing here. Nevertheless, the famous Hash House a Go Go name doesn't disappoint. 

BEWARE: This place tends to get super busy, especially on weekends. So either come really early...or really late. 

I came here with three other people and was forewarned about the portions here. When we tried to order our entrees we were told that there was a charge for sharing (what?!). Thankfully, our waitress suggested that we order two entrees and two sides so we could bypass the nonsense charge. First off, my friend and I ordered morning cocktails: a pineapple champagne cocktail and a hibiscus. Unfortunately, the drinks were not good. Save the money, it's not worth it. 

Interesting menu tid-bit: Look up on their menu O'Hare of the Dog. Only in Vegas would they have that as a menu item. 

As far as entrees went, we ordered the House Smoked Fresh Salmon Hash and the Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict with two sides: Mac and Cheese and some vegetables. The Hash was actually not very good at all. I swear the salmon tasted like it came out of a can and it was super dry. We ended up picking at it throughout the  meal and didn't even finish it. Now the Farm Benedict on the other hand....AMAZING!!!! Hands down one of the best entrees I've had for breakfast EVER! I couldn''t stop eating it! It was a combination of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy heaven. I wish we had ordered two of these. Thank goodness our waitress recommended it!! She also recommended the Brown Sugar Banana flapjacks, which I've read on yelp are amazing, but we didn't order it this time around. 

I would definitely say that the food saves this place. I can't speak for other locations. The service was sub-par, and for some reason they couldn't find any extra plates for us as well as silverware! It wasn't even that busy the morning we went so how does that happen?

I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the strawberry spread that I put on my biscuits, but less than an hour after walking out of there I had terrible stomach cramps. 

I bought pepto bismol at a convenience store and took one after another to help with the stomach pains. I was stuck in my hotel the rest of the day & night.  It ruined my time in Vegas.

I really think it was the strawberry spread that had been sitting on the table. Maybe it was contaminated with bacteria from lack of refrigeration.",1,1,1

Restaurants in general are average at best to me...  Generally a 3 star is a good rating.   However, despite the reviews that the portions are too large or the food needs salt....  Great news...  Salt is free here and in a convenient shaker located next to some spicy black stuff in a shaker too...  So, if you need more seasoning... Season away, it's FREE!... Huh...

Yes, the portions are massive and I am a hungry kinda Midwestern farm boy....  Food cooked to perfection.  If the portion is too large, you don't have to eat it all...it's ok if you don't; really...    

Price is more than reasonable for the portion size and being a Vegas restaurant.   There are healthy options of fresh fruit, , egg whites, etc.... And then there is the remainder of the menu filled with deliciousness....   This isn't just a breakfast food place; they have it all.

Before I talk about the food itself, the staff there were fantastic, friendly and quick, and served with a smile and generous quick wit. That was certainly a pleasure! 

To go with my food, I had an apple juice and here they serve it unfiltered which is just the way I like it.

It's amazing. 

The wait time to eat here is not long at all considering how popular it is! My cousin came and we waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. 

We came during brunch, so we still had breakfast cravings. I ordered the pancakes with potatoes and eggs and OMG! I was in Heaven and you for sure get what you pay for. 

Before receiving my food, my cousin and I kept gazing at all the large portions of food put on one person's order. The presentation was fantastic and it even made us hungrier watching people eat with such satisfaction! We waited about 20 minutes for our food not bad. 

My pancake was huge! the buttermilk once was yummy and it wasn't too thick. I didn't finish it, but I did finish my scrambled eggs and crispy potatoes! Those were nicely seasoned and made. Enjoyed them as the side to my pancake!

The restaurant brings a lot of great energy, but my waitress was not, She was a little grumpy and it seemed as though she did not enjoy her job one bit. She tried correcting us, when really, she was the one who made a mistake. I felt she just had a snobby attitude. If we had a better server then there really would be no downfalls to this place! 

Other than her, the rest of the customer service was great from the host to the guys from the kitchen to another waitress who was very kind to us.

It is sorta tricky to find, but that does not seem to deter Vegas tourists from visiting this totally fun place. 

We tried to visit on a Saturday morning but were greeted with a 45 minute wait. We were hungry, so we decided to pass this one up and try it again on Monday morning. Still a 35 minute wait, but we really wanted to try it. 

As others have said, once you are seated the service is excellent. The menu has all sorts of fun and unique offerings such as a banana latte and banana and maple sugar pancakes. My boyfriend and I are normally people who walk in and decide what we want fairly quickly, but Hash House's menu boasts so many unique flavors that it took us a while to decide. 

We finally decided that we wanted the sage fried chicken and waffles (apparently a Man VS. Food favorite), some pancakes, and a side of crispy potatoes. The waitress took one look at us (we are not large people) and recommended we wait on the pancakes until we received the rest of our food, as the portions are so good. We appreciated her honesty, because the portions were HUGE and the chicken and waffles and potatoes were more than enough. 

The flavor, texture, and presentation was superb. The sage as a bit of complexity to the chicken flavor that still mixes well with the waffles. The syrup was a little less sweet than most, which makes it perfect with the savory part of the dish. The chicken was also obviously high quality. One of the things I normally hate about fried chicken is the low quality chicken that places sometimes use. 

We fully enjoyed our dining experience. The dishes are so large and tasty looking that it is fun to watch the servers take them to their respective tables and then watch the look on the people's faces as they begin to dig in. We are already planning to visit again on our next Vegas trip, and even want to stop in late night after gambling just for one of their fun lattes.",3,0,0

Everything about the positive reviews were on point. The big portions, the taste and the selection. The only thing is that I  would've liked more hollandaise on my sage chicken benedict which consisted of coated  fried chicken, on 2 huge tasty biscuit, smoked Applewood bacon almost covered in hollandaise, which needed more of it at least on the side to keep the chicken from being dry, which I shared between the 3 of us.

I did share with the manager, so hopefully it's improved, unless you like brittle blackened bacon.
Don't let this review sway you from not going, I would go again for a meal, but will definitely pass on this appetizer!",0,0,0

We decided to try this place twice in Vegas because we had heard good things. We didn't want to try the chicken and waffles because we had heard other good things about hash a go go. 
This place was ""meh"". It's true. You get extremely large portions for your money. But bigger doesn't always mean better. Their food is bland and ""weird."" Although I don't know if that's the appropriate word. 
Hubby had the meatloaf. I had the fried chicken Alfredo. 
Our food came out in GIGANTIC portions. I mean like Jack and the Beanstalk big. 
The fried chicken was bland and the sauce for the chicken Alfredo was extremely bland. It was a mushroom sauce. What was weird about my Alfredo was that it has a half of apple at the bottom of it. Yup you read right. A half of a green apple. Yup weird right? I know. 
Hubby stuffed meatloaf was on top of fried mozzarella stuffed with mashed potatoes and greens. It left much be desired. Still bland yup. 
So we decided to give this place another try for breakfast. Hubby had he apple cinnamon pancake. The pancake was extremely thick with apple slices cooked inside the pancake. Hubby ate about a third of the pancake before he said he didn't want anymore because of the thickness of the pancake. He expresses the thickness of the pancakes took away from the flavor. 
I had French toast. It was dipped in banana cream batt r. To top it off. It had a sliced fried banana on top that was still in the peel. I didn't eat that. 
Their sausage and bacon were great. 
We had a total of 4 different meals from there. All weren't worth a returning visit. 
I definitely won't be visiting if I'm ever in Vegas again.",0,1,0

We waited 45 minutes for our table (8 of us) we were so starving by the tine we sat down! Our server (Courtney) was the BEST! She recommended the Chicken Benedict and the Chorizo Quesadilla and boy was she spot on. We also got the snickers pancake and the Chicken and waffles. All the dishes were delicious! Our service was surprisingly fast even though she informed us that she was going to ring in our food order before she brought our drinks because the food takes a little longer than most restaurants because everything is cooked to order. I think we waited about 20 min or so. Even though it was extremely busy, our drinks stayed full, Courtney checked on us several times and always promptly got us any requests (syrup, butter, napkins etc.) It appeared to only be 2 servers in the dinning area we were in, she let us know in the begining that we could also ask the other server if we needed anything. He was also very helpful and checked on us a few times (I don't remember his name, but he must have been 7 ft tall) she split our check several ways wich was nice since a lot of places on the strip wont. Reasonably priced for Vegas, especially since the portions are huge! If I had to give any constructive criticism, it would be for the girls up front at the wait stand could be a little friendlier (both African American and really rude) I was worried at first thinking all staff was going to be rude, but that wasn't the case at all. Everything else was perfect. Came back the next day for dinner and the service was OK. Definitely a different vibe at breakfast. Ill Definitely be back in July, and hopefully Courtney and the giant will be our servers again. Thank you Courtney and Hash House for a great 2.5 hours.",0,0,0

Waited an hour to eat and it was all WORTH IT. This place brought me back to life from a night of partying and celebrating. I'm a plain Jane so I got the plain buttermilk flapjack with eggs (scrambled with cheese) and potatoes and a side of bacon. My server Kai saw I was sitting alone and sat down at my table to take my order. Nice personal touch. She recommended some drinks for me and I opted for the Kiwi watermelon lemonade. She did advise is stir it a bit (altho it's soo pretty seeing the swirl of red yellow and green) to get the flavor a nice blend. Fresh watermelon in the drink, they give you a big straw to not disturb your drinking pleasure and boy was it delish. When my meal came out I now see why they only give u one flapjack. It's HUGE. It took up more than half of the plate and was so soft and buttery and yummy. They give u one cup of syrup and I barely used it the flapjack takes soo great. Eggs were divine, potatoes cooked awesome and bacon cooked to perfection. Many thanks for such great service and great food. I opted for the souvenir cup and my total was only $35. Not bad at all!!

Once we finally did sit down our order got taken quickly but we waited another good 30 minutes or more for food. And even saw parties seated after us get food first. I had the fried chicken Benedict and husband had the chicken and waffles. The food was good. Nothing extraordinary, nothing to wait in line for over an hour for but if I was able to get in fairly quickly I would go back. I think the hype is more for the portion size. HUGE!

It could've been my incredible hangover souring the experience, but everything that you hear and see about it vs what you experience in person are a night and day difference. 


The hostess was a meat head.  I walked up with my buddy, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""just so you know, the wait is like 40 minutes"". No greeting, no nothing.  I pointed to two empty seats at the bar and said ""can we sit there?"" And got a sure, go ahead. 

The bartender on the other hand was very friendly and welcoming. I am a bit of a chicken and waffles addict, so I ordered that along with a Diet Coke and a water.  My friend ordered a chicken caesar salad as he hadn't seen a vegetable in at least 72 hours.  

While waiting for our food, we were reminded how stupid the average person is.  Our first neighbours were an older likely married couple.  The wife started chatting my buddy up and having a laughing good time with him. So her husband got jealous of my friends 3 digit IQ and t shirt with sleeves on it, and said ""wah yew eatin a sal-ud?You some sort a lady boy?""  To which my friend, also hung over and in a bad mood, asked him to step outside and find out. They left in a huff. 

Back to the chicken and waffles. Generally the best dish ever.  so when you order it at a famous restaurant, you're basically expecting the food equivalent of the uncensored blurred lines video.  What I got was more along the lines of meatloaf's ""I will do anything for love"".  

The dish was bountiful but half of it was what you find at the bottom of the box that holds your grandmas 20 year old fake Christmas tree.  I didn't ask for my food to be covered in pine needle branches and lawn trimmings, but it was.  My appetite was completely ruined and I ate all of seven bites.  I've seen the movie ""waiting"" and know what happens when you send food back (and can do a mean batwing) so I cut my losses and left. 

My buddy's review of his salad: ""meh"" 

Check the photo for the strangeness of the chicken and waffles. Made no sense to me.  They're so much better up here in the Canadian white north

Biscuits are huge and fluffy and the gravy is amazing.  Will go back for the chicken and waffles or the vanilla waffles next time.  Wonderful food, good value but not quiet!",1,0,0

My family and I went to Hash House during 4th of July week. Our server was very friendly and hospitable. Our party had 3 adults and a 9 month old baby. My son-in-law had the sage chicken Benedict. My daughter and I had the chicken pot pie. As the other reviews reflected: the portion sizes are MEGA. That's not a problem though for my son-in-law because he's a big eater.

HHAGG is located inside of Quad hotel. According to our very friendly waiter, they offer food from 5 different menus. We got here around 10pm so the menu they offered had a handful of burgers and sandwiches, sage fried chicken and waffles, and a few breakfast items. 

Portions are gargantuous! Easily shared by two very hungry adults! 

We ordered & shared the Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, ....and if that isn't enough, they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!!  Sounds weird I know, but it's like nothing you've ever tasted before, in a good way!

I don't remember the dish I got the first time I came to Hash House, but I do remember that it had too many different things going on.

This second time around, Adam Richman had coerced me via the wonderful world of television, to visit this place again and divulge in the wonders of the ""fried chicken benedict."" Oh Adam, you deceive me yet again.

It was a very mellow Vegas Sunday morning. We stayed at the LINQ so we had all our bags packed, and went downstairs for our breakfast, around 9am. I mean, it's 9am on a Sunday in Vegas. There couldn't be a wait, could there? Behold, the packs of small parties waiting at the top of the escalator, looking annoyed and hungry. Our wait wasn't too long, perhaps a good 20-25minutes or so? Luckily, we had bags to load up in our car in the hotel parking lot, so we killed time pretty efficiently (go, girls!).

The three ladies and I were seated in a small and cramped circular table, much too small to occupy 4 large (and must I say, very large) dishes. Each one of us ordered a dish; of course, Adam had gotten into my head, so I got the fried chicken benedict. Another friend followed suit, and we also got a steak omelette and smoked salmon hash.

+ Fried Chicken Benedict, famously known as the ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken"" somethin somethin. Wayyy  too much going on again. The chipotle cream something sauce was too overpowering. My favorite part? The bed of chunky mashed potato at the very bottom of everything. The fried chicken was mediocre, and the biscuits were just wayyy too much.

+ Steam Omelette. One of their weekend specials; probably one of the better dishes of this crowd because of its simplicity.

+ Smoked Salmon Hash. My sister's plate, and to say the very least....she felt like she would've sent it back, if it didn't take so long to get our food already.

All in all, I would much rather go to a different brunch place, for food that is cheaper, and much tastier.",2,0,2

I luckily was able to talk my in-laws into going to this place on our last day after this place was featured on a Travel Channel documentary.  Everything was as I imagined it and more.  The food was amazing and my in-laws actually loved it too.  The portions are HUGE.  Three people could easily share 1 buttermilk pancake and be full.  You really could eat here and be done for the rest of the day.  The food is very fresh and as a beer fan, I loved that one of the items on the menu was a cheap tall can in a brown paper bag. Classy!  The restaurant was very clean and I loved the farmhouse decor.  It was like eating in a clean, hip barn.  Everything we ordered for breakfast was great, and I am guessing lunch and dinner are just as good.  It only lost a star because the waiters and our waitress had some 'tude.  Our waitress did not come check on us once we were given our food and I never saw her again to ask for a drink refill until she was bringing the check.

I was not even close to finishing my french toast.  There were two inch and a half thick slices that were about 5 inches square.  It was flavorful and served with a grilled banana.

Let me tell you, if all his recommendations were this spot on, I maybe forced to push thru legalizing gay marriages. The portions were huge, so big in fact that I literally took half of it in a to-go box and munch on it while traveling to Phoenix. Not only are the portions are huge, but they're f***ing fantastic.

Once I booked my trip to Vegas I made it my mission to go here at least once. We stopped by on a Saturday morning and yes, there was a wait list, but it moved quickly.  

I had to try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict from Man V. Food and it didnt disappoint. When it's first laid in front of you you begin to question what the hell you signed up for. Then you dig in and realize that it's all good (almost). It's a lot easier if you attack it a layer or 2 at a time. If you cant finish all of it, at least knock out the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cream sauce. Those were the best parts. The fried pasta and the tomato dont really add anything special. Next time I come I want to try something with a bit of sweet to it instead of something entirely savory. The price is on point and pretty fair considering the amount of food that you get. The drinks can make your bill jump, though. Stick to maybe 1 juice and some water.

Overall the service was very speedy and friendly. Another thing I loved about the place was the music! During my time there I heard The Black Eyed Peas, Prince, Aaliyah, Sade, and Zhane! Now that's what I'm talking about!

On to the recommendations of food. Nothing new to say, Andys Sage Chicken is the go to and BLT Bloody Mary. Same thing every time.  

If there is one NEGATIVE,  I would have to say that the wait is somewhat long bordering on ridiculous. If you get there before 8-8:30, you are usually ok. After that good luck. For us to wait, eat, and get back to hotel was a 3 hour excursion. I bring all this up because I really believe the waitresses are to blame. I understand they are busy, but if they were more attentive, not only would things be quicker, but they would turn more table over which everyone knows means more tips and probably big ones at that. For example, we were done for 15 and the waitress had to be flagged down for us to leave.
All in all, I still give a five because it is worth it if you got the time and patience. 

Shout out to @nunezcesar7 for the good times here.",0,1,1

Sooo I knew we were going to have to wait a while because it was packed and we were a party of 8. The hostess said it would be about an hour and a half. So we waited...and waited...

Meanwhile, a big party that checked in after us got seated before us. 

But we waited some more...and waited.

Finally, one of us went to ask the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us 30 on top of how long we already waited. So we decided to wait an extra 30 since we were so close!!

We waited...and waited. 30 minutes went by and they still didn't call is. Another one of us went to double check if it would be soon. We were all getting very hungry. 

And this time the hostess told us 45 minutes!!! And we told her that someone had told us 30 minutes ago, that it was 30 minutes. She just looked at him and said it would be ABOUT 45 more minutes.

Needless to say, after losing over two hours of our day on just waiting to get in..we gave up and went somewhere else.

Big, fulfilling portions and good service without ever having to leave the hotel. I got the salmon farmers' scramble with potatoes on the side, although I regret not ordering the side of mashed potatoes instead because those were so much better. Although it was really good, I was expecting something outstanding and wow-worthy because of the hype from other people. It tasted alright, but could be compared as similar to any other brunch restaurant that is of higher quality than Dennys' or ihop. The price is also similar to other brunch restaurants, so I wasn't too upset or disappointed.

Next time, I am set on ordering the lobster\/fried chicken eggs Benedict because I stole a few bites from my friend (not like they were gonna finish that monster of a portion anyway) and it was delicious!!! Way better than what I ordered.

While visiting Vegas for Tough Mudder my hunny and I were absolutely famished after our 20K run through the muddy hot dessert heat. We were told that the portions here at HHAGG were HUGE and I was up for the challenge. 

The service here was up beat and cheerful without being over the top. Our server Cody was great, offering suggestions when I couldn't decide what to have. Their all day menu didn't make it easy, but after narrowing it down to a few choices Cody directed me in the right direction. Our food came out in a timely manner, hot and delicious! 

Saying the portions here are HUGE is a serious understatement. A standard meal here can feed my family of 4, no exaggeration. They don't skimp on presentation either-the food looks sooo good!! 

Noteworthy... 

-Hash House is a little hidden gem. Had we not overheard someone talking about it we probably would have known it existed in The Linq. As hotel guests that's too bad. 

-As we were settling up our server offered to refill my soda. I said just a bit as we were almost done. She offered a to go cup! While this little detail is minor to some, to me it was that little detail that stuck and made a huge impact on our experience.

My friends and I went nearing Memorial Day weekend. I, of course, suggested this place only because I'm a Man vs. Food fan and had to try the ever so popular Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict. The dish was absolutely massive and the presentation was perfect. The combination of the flavors (tomatoes, cheese, bacon, and egg) was definitely something to ""Yelp"" about all on its own - - down to the mash potatoes and the huge, fresh biscuit.  However, I found the chicken itself to be good, but not great [hence a rating of only 4 stars]. As a fried chicken connoisseur there was absolutely no flavor in the chicken. It definitely had to be combined with the chipotle sauce to be fully enjoyed, but it was not dry. I did eventually add Tabasco sauce which heightened the entire dish ten-fold. Furthermore, although it was not a Man vs. Food challenge, you can't eat the entire dish. It's just impossible. If you're able to finish the dish and live to tell about it, I'd be convinced that (1) an additional stomach was surgically added to your digestive system or (2) you're a cow.

The waiter was extremely nice and very accommodating I must add. I would definitely suggest this place to any Vegas visitors\/residents that want good food, good portions, and at a seemingly good price. Enjoy yourselves and don't forget the Tabasco! ;-)",1,0,0

Mushroom burger - meat was kind of dry, big burger. Also pricey but not tasty. Whyyyyy. 

Basic - ham, over medium egg, crispy potatoes. This is a super basic dish and I picked this because everything else looked really intense and they still managed to serve me something that I can make better myself. 

Sage fried chicken - dried chicken, it also tasted kind of sweet. Gross. 

Original hash Benedict - loads of food but also meh. The bacon tasted like pork rinds. 

Banana pancake - this thing is huge! I would say this is the best tasting out of everything we ordered but they also forgot to put this in and it took forever to come out. We finished our food, paid for the bill, and waited an extra 15mins for this pancake.

That being said, I think that's where all the ""hype"" is over here at hash house.  My friends and I decided to come here based on all of the great reviews of the place and waited for over an hour on a Friday morning.  I was surprised to see so many people at 10am, but I guess a Friday before a long weekend will do that kinda thing.

Food-wise, I went ahead and took the advice of many of my fellow yelpers, and got the corned beef hash.  Piece of advice for those who don't already know....the hash's are literally gigantic pieces of _____ (whatever meat you may choose) over crispy potatoes\/wedges. It is not easily mixable, as the potatoes that are given are also rather large.

The hash was good in itself, but definitely not what I was expecting.  Another one of my friends got the meatloaf hash which did not look too appetizing because they were just pieces of meatloaf chopped up over those crispy potatoes.

The pancakes looked ridiculously large but I did not try them.

Overall, it was an interesting experience to try this place, but I felt that there was maybe a little too much hype surrounding this restaurant.

The wait staff were nice and attentive, which makes sense since the place was a ghost town. Me and my dining companion split the warm spinach salad (hold the cheese) and Andy's sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower. I really enjoyed the spinach salad and I was happy we ordered this to balance the meal since the other dish was so sweet. They could have been more generous with the portion of salad for the price. It was also over dressed. Next time I would order the dressing on the side.

The chicken and waffle dish is probably what a good majority of the people come to try. No one loves bacon more than Belle, but I felt the bacon got lost in the waffle. There was a generous portion of fried chicken piled on top of the four waffle pieces. I liked the chicken. I felt there was a good fry to it. Of course, boneless chicken was a plus too because it meant I didn't need to go all ghetto trying to tear into the chicken. What killed the dish for me was all the syrup. I'm generally not a fan of syrup and this dish had far too much on it. The waffles seemed to have syrup not only drizzled over it, but infused inside the waffle. It was just all way too sweet. I felt that even if I ordered the syrup on the side it would have been way to sweet for me. The portion on this item was so large, it is definitely a dish to share. Even with the big eater I was with, we had left overs.",16,13,13

When we arrived at 9:30AM there was no wait. When we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. Let me tell you, I would have been PISSED if I had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!

Drinks - I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade and BF ordered a Pistachio Iced Mocha. The drinks were awesome! Mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. His Pistachio Mocha was sooo good! I was mad that I didn't order it. 

For breakfast both my BF and my BFF ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or french toast for one extra dollar. BFF got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and BF got the Vanilla Waffle. 

Their eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. His waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.

My order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? This is what happened to me. 

I ordered the HH Original Benedict. Eggs Benedict - I expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. Whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things I need. I read that I would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mashed potatoes, although I didn't know how that would fit in. I read about the red pepper cream, but I thought that would be along with my hollandaise. I read basted eggs, and I honestly didn't know what that meant. 

So I received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. I get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.

The taste? Eh. The top layers are alright. The basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. The bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry mashed potatoes. Not a good combo. They really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.

There are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in Vegas - this is not one I would revisit. Also, apparently there was an episode of Man vs Food filmed here? That must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. Wow, I am so impressed.",7,5,7

They have 4 locations in Nevada and one in California serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I'd heard all the fuss about Man vs Food and knew I better check this place out. We were a group of 10 and since reservations weren't allowed, we expected a long wait. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday surprised to see no line and lots of empty tables.  It's never a good sign for a place to be that empty on a Friday, but maybe it's because it's so hidden within the Imperial Palace Casino. 

I grew up eating food like this, but never have I seen such large portions and presentation. We were served complementary biscuits before dinner. These things were impressively huge, but a bit too dense. I prefer a light and fluffy biscuit, but easily ate a half of one drizzled with honey.  For the main course, I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict. This thing could have fed a family of four, with two boneless pieces of fried chicken served over a biscuit, mashed potatoes, tomatoes, spinach and covered with scrambled eggs, bacon, mozzarella and chipotle cream sauce for $15.95.  Overall the dish looked impressive, but didn't wow me on taste. It was good, but I expected bold flavors and didn't get it. Of course I was happy to sample several other people's food at the table like the meatloaf pasta, the BBQ ribs and the chicken pot pie.  I found the pot pie to be the best out of everything I tried. The meatloaf pasta was good, but the St. Louis style ribs were disappointing, but of course I am spoiled being from St. Louis. Probably the most entertaining part of the experience was watching a drunk guy at a table nearby devour his platter of chicken benedict without passing out in it.

Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation.  Definitely worth a visit though just for the experience!",3,1,2

My husband ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and we both shared it. We specifically wanted to try it because we saw it on Man vs. Food and saw Adam try the dish.

I am a breakfast lover and could eat it morning and night, so when I touched down in Vegas for the first time at 10 pm on a Wednesday night my sister brought me here.

Our server was attentive and quick, taking our orders and bringing them out efficiently. I wish I had gotten one of the signature drinks with a souvenir glass but perhaps next time. I got the lemonade which wasn't too sweet but had a kick and enjoyed my time. The farmer's scramble with avocados was delicious, not overly cooked and the avocado and other ingredients did not overwhelm. It wasn't too salty either. As for my Belgian waffle it was PERFECTION. Perfectly crispy and not dry or sweet. The maple syrup was also not too thick or sweet, which I appreciated. I loved the presentation and my goodness, those portions could feed Africa!

Drinks: The coffee is pretty weak.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is sour.  

Food: 
Sage Fried Chicken - This dish starts out okay.  I really liked the fried scallions but in the end, the breading didn't have enough ""maple infusion"" so that it lacked flavor.  The meat was also pretty dry.  

Roasted Chicken Hash - Giant pieces of chicken breast cooked with various vegetables and potatoes.  Sounds like it had potential but the pieces of chicken are so dry and tasteless as to almost be inedible.  The scrambled eggs were okay but the biscuit was blah.

My friend and I split the sage fried chicken bennedict and we did really well, but still had a ton left over (I saw it on Man. Vs. Food).  There's a $2 fee to split a dish, but our server told us right away about it and then said that if we ordered a side dish, we could wave the split charge.

Huge Southern Indiana style food taken to a new level. This place was highly recommended to us by friends so we checked it out, mostly for the chicken and waffles.

HUGE portions left us both a little too full. I would recommend splitting a dish here (and that is from a girl that knows how to eat). Don't plan to eat healthy here, if that is your plan go somewhere else.

You can order bloody Mary's while waiting to be seated. We ran downstairs and lost some money at O'Sheas wile waiting and popped back up. I do think they need a notification system for when your table is ready, especially since we were told 45 minutes and checked back early and were seated in 25.

What we ordered:

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w\/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. I could have done without the cheese and mashed potatoes here. The sauce is not a typical hollandaise, more of a spicy southern dressing (still very good)

Chicken & Waffles. Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks. I have had better waffles, but these we're good and had bacon in them? So probably no complaining. Reduction sauce was delish, I wanted more syrup but my boyfriend was fine with it. The leeks were a great flavor in the dish, but not that ""Eater friendly"" to actual eat. The boyfriend choked a little and moved the rest to the side. He ordered and loved the house mimosa made with fresh squeezed tangerine.

I would have loved to try one of the many coffee drinks but knew It would be too much!

The sage fried chicken in both dishes was wonderful. Great texture and super flavorful.

The pork tenderloin, meatloaf, and bread pudding all looked amazing as well.",1,0,0

The chicken is moist and that crust stayed crispy THE ENTIRE MEAL. The sage and rosemary was a nice flavor addition to keep it from being your usual, and the waffles were very light and airy yet crispy on the outside.  Overall, while the dish looks very overwhelming, it was very easy to eat and never felt greasy or too heavy.  It was really really good.

I also enjoyed their Smoked Salmon Benedict--this is not the lox-style smoked salmon, this is cooked so if that's not your steeze, don't order it.  It's got a heavy handed pour of the Red Pepper cream sauce (which is not a bad thing) atop two very hearty biscuits.  

We also had the Sage Chicken Salad--and when you think to yourself ""this is not the time to be ordering a salad""...don't be fooled.  The salad is the size of a bowling ball and will feed you hearty.  

There is usually a wait--unless you have a late lunch\/early dinner.

Definitely make time for this breakfast. It is great if you are hungover, and if you aren't, you can order a drink while waiting. If you can split with someone, though, I highly recommend it - for your own safety!",3,2,2

Going up the escalator to Hash House, I was faced with huge crowds of people waiting for tables. The lovely benefit of eating alone is the ability to jump ahead of lines when there's space at the bar, and gratefully this was one of those occasions.

My server was super friendly, and got me set up with a tangerine mimosa and some fresh peach jam for the gigantic biscuit that came with my basil, goat cheese & sun dried tomato scramble. It also came with some potatoes and fresh fruit. The potatoes were pretty meh, but everything else was fucking delicious!

Being a first time patron, I decided to go easy: two eggs, one pancake, potatoes. The eggs and the pancakes were fine, the potatoes were nothing special, in quality and quantity - nothing more then grilled, salt, ... .  

My companion had corn beef hash, potatoes, two eggs potatoes and a biscuit.
1. The hash was made from shredded corn beef: The meat was taste but shredded is not the way it should be used here. This made it  difficult to swallow.
2. The eggs were okay, like min, not extra large.
3. The potatoes, like mine, were nothing special but not burnt.
And 4. The potatoes were, sneak-a-ly, put  under the hash, making the portion look tremendous - fake-out.
5. Finally the biscuit: Large, yes, HEAVY like a rock, yes.  Not appetizing.

The staff were amicable, but very rehearsed: If I heard the word ""tremendous portions""  one more time, I would have left: The manager was explaining the menu to the people in the next booth. ""Tremendous Portions, Made Fresh Daily, Made In-House""
over and over and over again.

The icing on the pancake: $28.00 is too much for a basic breakfast food.

My girlfriend said she had been to the Sahara location before and it was very good. So, I repeat - this was one experience at one location.

I will try again but not real soon.

On our first attempt, there was a 90 minute wait for breakfast\/brunch (ummm... no) so we left. The second time we tried, the wait was much shorter. 

I was annoyed by the fact that the hostess was not taking names in the order that we had lined up. People decided to walk in the front of the line and get their name on the list while the rest of us stood there waiting. She kept stopping to address other people instead who came up to talk to her instead of getting us out of the way and then addressing their concerns.

We almost missed our reservation because, even though I spelled my name AND pronounced it for her (my name is a fairly common English word, so...),  she mangled it so horribly (how?!) that we didn't know what the hell she was even saying. She kept calling this weird name that nobody seemed to respond to, so my party got up to see if it was our party she was calling. Good thing we did...

We got seated and the waiter comes to our table and exclaims ""Girls!! How are we today?"" You could practically feel the collective bristle at the table from that. I'm absolutely certain the waiter meant no harm by it and was just trying (a little too hard, we'd later find) to be friendly, but all of us are highly educated, professional women over 30 and we haven't been ""girls"" in a very long time. ""Ladies"" would have been a much more acceptable, and respectful, term.

Anyway, the waiter is so busy being ""on"" that he rushes through our drink orders and doesn't give me a chance to give mine. I finally get to order the lemonade while another guest in our party ordered the watermelon lemonade. It has vodka in it, which I can't drink, but I heard that it was very good. It looked beautiful. Huge points for aesthetics! The regular lemonade I had was just the right balance or tart and sweet and and made with real, honest to goodness *gasp* lemons! 

My best friend and I decided to split the chicken and waffles dish that we'd heard so much about, while the other person in our party ordered one if the hash plates, served in a cast iron skillet. The chicken and waffles looked like a huge portion, but after the breading started to break off of my chicken, I realized that it wasn't as much as it appeared to be. Plus, I wasn't a big fan of the Indiana-style sage fried thing they had going on. The waffles were ok. They  normally cook slices of bacon into the waffles, but we got the bacon on the side. They gave us 4 waffles in our order, but barely enough syrup for 2. The other person in our party enjoyed her hash plate though,  which was a huge portion that came with eggs, a biscuit the size of a small pillow and a few thin slivers of cantaloupe and a few berries on the side.

Overall, the meal didn't live up to the hype for me. I really expected a much better dining experience given all the hype I'd heard about it beforehand.  Maybe if I'd gone in blind and not knowing much about it, I wouldn't have left so unimpressed.",1,0,0

It took us a while to figure out a good place to eat breakfast at since we decided to walk along the Strip to hunt down a Fat Tuesday. But we ended up back at my brother's hotel to try their in house restaurant.

We took a set of escalators up to the second floor to get to the restaurant. It was fairly packed and they had told us that it would take about 45 minutes to be seated. They didn't have beepers to let you know when to come back, but we decided to just stick around the a lot machines downstairs and walk around outside before coming back up to wait there for 10 minutes. Seating was scarce to find when waiting, so we hung out by the wall near the elevator where there were plaques of menus with signatures and pictures with the corresponding star.

We finally were seated and I settled for their signature chicken and waffles while the boys decided to get the spicy hamburger. Between the three of us, these two dishes were definitely enough and over. They serve such big portions that I couldn't imagine trying to finish a dish by myself.

I really love the touch of rosemary on the chicken and how light and fluffy the waffles were, which had sticks of bacon inside. The hamburger was really juicy and the fries that came with it were bomb. We ended up having leftover chicken and waffles that my brother willingly took for a snack opportunity later on.

If your goal is an Instagram-worthy photo of a plate of food the size of your head, this is your place. Big on portions, not so big on taste.

There wasn't much eggs benedict-y about it, rather I assume they were like 'hey, what can we throw on a plate and see if it kills a person in one sitting?' Biscuits, fried chicken, chipotle cream sauce\/Queso\/something, bacon, fried cheese blanket of some sort, eggs...and spinach and tomatoes, because health. On a bed of potatoes. With a knife jammed through it just to really drive the point home. And some fried spaghetti garnish in the middle for no apparent reason whatsoever.

It didn't really meld well together, and the fried chicken was dry and kind of tasteless (WHITHER, SAGE?). I ended up poking around in it\/deconstructing it and eating what was good (bacon, biscuits, potatoes, CHEESE BLANKET). It was honestly enough food for 3-4 people, but it wasn't great food. That fried cheese blanket was baller, though. 

Travis with the giant mohawk was our server and he was pretty good. He did bust my friend's chops for ordering 'just' the junior cheeseburger, and dudes: it was enough for a couple of people.

My Server was Tara S. And she was not attentive whatsoever.  We had a larger group of 7 and we really never saw our server.

I also alerted a blonde male host that we needed more attention and he did not alert the manager.  

Bacon was cold and my pancakes got cold while a waited for our drinks.  Honestly I am very disappointed I brought a group of friends from out of town and it was embarrassing.  Great place having an off day but that's no excuse for bad service and an uncomfortable climate.  Vegas is a hot place especially on the strip and it's not fun to eat in a hot dining room.

Fiancee ordered the chicken and waffles and could barely eat half of it. I myself had the blackened chicken skillet and only made my way through 3\/4. Chicken was nice and tender for both our entrees. Friends ordered the NY Strip and it was actually a very impressive steak for a place like this.

Yes, I have only heard amazing things about this place, and I'm sure it may be true however, the service I received during my visit completely ruined this experience for me.

I came here early on a weekday night with a party of 4, let's day 9ish. We were sat right away which was great, as I had attempted coming here three different times only to have to turn around due to the ungodly wait times.

So here I am, on cloud 9 finally getting to try all of the amazing things I hear about HH.
30 MINUTES LATER someone finally comes over to take our drink order. Another 20 minutes go by before we receive them. Another 15 minutes before we order and ONE HOUR before the food came out...
I'm sure you can see were I'm going with this.
I am a very reasonable person when it comes to dining out, and as I have been a waitress in the past, I completely know how this thing works.

THIS, was on another level.

As what takes the cake?? MY CHICKEN WAS RAW. 

I don't have words. After waiting over two hours for food, and having raw chicken delivered to my table.... I still don't have words.

The server was very nice and very apologetic and did not charge us for the meal however, It will take a lot for me to try HHAGG again.",2,2,0

It was nearly 5:40 before we ate and had to leave quickly for a show. It didn't help that our waiter was joking with another table that he was still drunk from the night before and based on info from the manager it seems he didn't put in our order right away.

I heard great things about this place for years and this was the first time I was willing to wait for it. My group of 3 came around lunch time and was notified that the wait for our table would be around 25 minutes. Due to not having all of our people there at the same time, we had to postpone our wait time but the hostess was very patient. We were able to just go up to her when all of us were there and we would get a table as soon as possible.

Once seated, we looked over the menu and decided we would share our food. We ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Corned Beef hash. We shared 2 dishes with 3 people, it could have easily served 4. Sage fried chicken was pretty good. We asked for the syrup on the side because I had a previous experience with another Hash House where it was overwhelmingly sweet. Without it, the waffles were good. They were soft and had bacon cooked in them. The chicken itself was tender and the skin was crunchy. As for taste, it was excellent. The corned beef hash was not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. The corned beef did not really have a prominent taste and I kind of wish the strips were a little bit smaller in size. The potatoes were the only saving grace for the dish - i love me some potatoes.

Service was excellent. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. I dock 1 star because of the long wait time for our food. It took about 40 minutes for our fried chicken to come out and even longer for the hash to come. I guess we were lucky though. The table next to us waited over an hour for 2 burgers.

She took my info and said, ""okay, we have you down for 3 people at 5:00 to 5:30 tonight.""  I just said thanks.  I wasn't too worried as we were eating early and I doubted we'd have to wait anyway.

When we show up and I tell the guy at the front that I called earlier and made a reservation, he said, ""I don't think so as we don't take same day reservations.""  Then he checked the book and said, ""oh, here you are,"" and showed us to our table.

When our server came to take our drink order, my friend asked for a rum-based cocktail and the server said that they didn't have rum, but that they have vodka cocktails.  We asked for a few more minutes and then asked her to switch the tv channel (the place was pretty empty and we pretty much had a tv to ourselves) to the women's world cup. 

After she left I turned around and looked at the restaurant bar and noticed that they had every spirit under the sun, so my friend went up and talked to the bartender, who easily made her a mai tai.  With rum.

Things perked up after that.  The tv channel was changed so we could watch the soccer game, we all ended up with delicious drinks; and the food was outstanding.  Two of us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were delicious, but the pasta was a little heavy on the sauce.  Otherwise, it was your pretty standard spaghetti and meatballs (though apparently they use a funky pasta that is hollow in the center, which you really couldn't discern while eating it).  My other friend ordered the sage fried chicken penne pasta and it was outstanding.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the porcini mushroom cream sauce was to die for (and I hate mushrooms)!

Went in mid-February on a trip to Vegas for about the 'umpteeenth' time and it just doesn't ever get old!!  Went for dinner on this trip with a group of friends and everyone ordered different items to share.  It was great to get to try a few things that I wouldn't order myself and not focus on dinner\/lunch food .  A couple of 'surprises' that stood out to me: spaghetti and meatballs; butternut squash and the skillet chicken.   Strawberry shortcake dessert was great as was the new chocolate waffle dessert.

+ Went 11 on a Friday morning, was told there'd be a 15 min wait, waited 10 or less.

+ Maybe the best breakfast I've had, period. Split the chicken and waffles. Still couldn't finish it all. Also tried a couple of the scrambles that friends got, and were delicious. The biscuits were wonderful, too.

+ Drinks were some of the best I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas. We got the spiked watermelon lemonade, both juices fresh. It came in a glass that you get to keep and is actually super neat, and nice quality. The booze is something like 20 oz and strong - and that with the glass is $12.95. If you ask me, that is not bad. 

Heads up that it is in a super random spot in the middle of the Imperial Palace casino, so kinda hard to find.

I would like to give a special shout out to our waiter. I will come back and add his name if I can find my receipt. He was so attentive, helpful, friendly, everything, had great suggestions, didn't mind that we asked him to take like 50 pics, offered to put the second watermelon lemonade we ordered for the road (because they were that good) into several cups so we could all share.

We walked up and the lady sitting next to where we were standing  said ""You should take a seat! It's first come first serve back here.""

That time I had the chicken and waffles. A little bit different from how I usually have chicken and waffles, but the sage completely changed the dish for me, for the better. 
This time, I went to the Hash House at the Linq. We had a little trouble looking for it, someone said it was on the second floor, but when we took the elevators there it was just guest rooms. We found the escalator, but we had my infant daughter there in her stroller, with NO elevator access. So we had to bring it up the very narrow escalator. I guess this would be a complaint more about the hotel, which was very smokey compared to any of the other hotels on the strip. Even in the restaurant, the smell was over whelming.
This trip I ordered the meatloaf. We were given a free set of biscuits to try. Excellent! Very buttery and sweet. My food came out and was very good, but the portion was huge. I could not finish it cuz; 1. its was so big and 2. I had a headache from all the smoke. 
Again, I don't think this is the restaurants fault, more of the hotel's issue. The Linq was the Imperial Palace and it appears that they just remolded the outside and not the inside.

My chicken was cooked very well. The batter was crispy and not too heavy. The waffles were packed with bacon IN them.

My only complaint is that I wanted more syrup which could have easily been addressed had I asked my super friendly waiter. 

The Benny was also huge and very well presented. The biscuits were warm and wonderful. They were dense and biscuit experts may say they weren't flakey enough, but then they were covered with a hollandaise sauce that had a little kick. The fresh, red mashed potatoes were home-style (nicely lumpy) and an odd but tasty addition to a breakfast dish.

Because it takes an average person a long, long time to dig through the MASSIVE portions that Hash House serves!

The chicken and waffles is always a winner! Three massive pieces of chicken on top of four waffles stuffed with bacon. Drizzle everything with syrup... Yummy yum yum!

Service was meh. Our server was nonexistent after he took our orders, and the food took forever to come out. All of that contributes to the long wait, and I'm guessing they won't change anything as long as people are willing to line up well out the door to eat here.

The restaurant was definitely busy at that time, but it got busier since there was a small group of people waiting by the time we left. We ordered:

There were a lot of flavors going on here, and they drown everything in sauce, but it's good in that ""I can feel my arteries clogging up"" way. Definitely worth trying once!

For 4 girls, two dishes were more than enough, and we still had leftovers even though we were super full. They had a ton of other items on the menu, so I will have to come back to try other dishes. Service was ok, but not super attentive, which isn't surprising. I was disappointed that we didn't get any of the biscuits that are complimentary if you come for dinner.",2,1,1

I ordered a chicken sausage and she told me the casing was pork. Most servers don't think that far ahead to tell a customer whose ordering chicken sausage that it contains pork, because obviously they don't want pork sausage or they wouldn't go out of their way to order chicken. 

She also told us how long the ticket times were, which I've never had a server do in a casual restaurant. What a great idea! That way, you're not sitting & thinking with a stink eye that they forgot about your order because it's taking a while. We really liked her service very much. If you're hungry, this is the spot.

The fried chicken was forgettable. It was dry, bland and had no flavor at all. I ended up using ketchup and tabasco on the chicken to eat it. It was quite greasy and the batter was sweet? Probably some maple in the batter but i didn't care for it. If there was some salt, then maybe. It was too late by the time it got to the table to add salt since it wouldn stick to the crust.

Like seriously, omfg.

I had to have texted my friend just those four letters at least 5 times because this place was better than I could have imagined.
This was seriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Ever. 

My boyfriend & I saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on Man vs. Food. Now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where Adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. And in my opinion, it could not have been better.

First, I had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. I mean, I had never even heard of the Imperial Palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. Also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.

I was totally wrong.

The restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. It's really spacious and clean, and they play AWESOME music. Also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. WHO ELSE DOES THAT!? No one, that's who.
My boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things. 

For breakfast I ordered the Tractor combo which I got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the Brown Sugar Banana pancake.
That's right. This was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. 
This was a HUGE effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. OMFG.
Drool. 
The delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. I was a little closer to heaven with each bite. 
The eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. I was very impressed.

My boyfriend chose the Man vs. Food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of mashed potatoes and biscuits topped with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. It was HUGE. Definitely the Frankenstein's monster of benedicts if I've ever seen it.
It was also very tasty though. The chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. Especially for fried chicken. The chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. 

The service was also spectacular. Our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. She told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. That is fine with me! 
This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. Great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and HUGE portions. 
I will for SURE be coming back to this place as soon as I can. 
I would even drive all the way out to Vegas again just to come to the Hash House, it's that good. Next time I HAVE to try the Chicken & Bacon Waffles. 
Yes. They have bacon waffles.

The Basic: this has two eggs, two sausage, a biscuit, potatoes and a slice of cantaloupe. This was just a basic breakfast. The sausage was not that good, very soft and mushy. The potatoes and biscuit was amazing and cooked to perfection.

I have made 2 phone calls, 1 in-person visit, and an email to corporate...  nothing has been done and no one has taken the time to investigate.

As far as I'm concerned Kortni stole the $50 cash and the managers are colluding to cover this up...

If you've got the drunk breakfast munchies, take my advice and head over to the Denny's. You'll save yourself about 50% and will be less disappointed.

Hubby got red velvet waffles, and I picked vanillas both delicious. We both only ate half of each of our waffles. Sausage was quality and not that soft mushy cheap sausage, friend chicken was delicious, but the breast and leg they serve is a bit small. The presentation matches the yummy taste for the most part. My son ordered his usual of the kids' menu (from every restaurant) the mac and cheese, but it was in a pool of cheese- way too much for us and we love cheesey food. Corrin quickly replaced it with his 2nd choice, grilled cheese on perfectly toasted wheat bread with fries, but again way too much cheese. So he wasted it :-( I'd have him order something that doesn't come with cheese next time. They seem to over due it in that area. I also enjoyed the hot chocolate. It is one of the better ones out there. They do not offer gluten free items so my daughter ate tomatoes and sausage. She enjoyed it.",0,0,0

After reading several reviews about the long waits, we placed a name down on the waiting list for a group of 7 since reservations are not taken on the weekends. The hostess estimated an hour+ wait, but it was actually half that time. My friends and I went downstairs to the tables and gambled for 30 minutes, then went back to check the wait status. Lucky us, there was a table ready when we checked back in!

Time to break down the ratings for the food inducing coma items. WARNING: The following items listed were shared family style, the servers will remind you their portions are huge and sharing is advised unless your level of hangry is off the charts.

Sage Fried Chicken (5\/5): The ultimate bomb dot com entree you want for brunch. One of the most popular dishes and we could all see why. Gravy + biscuit + chicken, that deadly delicious combo had our tastebuds going.

Corned Beef House Hash (5\/5): One of the best corned beef hashes I've had. You could taste the strips of corned beef which was salted to perfection.

Buttermilk Flapjack Pancakes (5\/5): At the end of the day, pancakes are pancakes... The specialty of Hash Hash pancakes is that its served as one flapjack and measures 14 inches in diameter! You aren't missing on much if you decide to forgo pancakes, but it's a great item to share in large groups.

Ham, Spinach, & Cheddar Farm Scrambles (3.5\/5): My least favorite dish, there's nothing special about it. The group wanted an item with eggs since the rest was already carb heavy. Can't have brunch without eggs.

On top of the food being amazing, it is also super affordable, the amount everyone paid for was roughly around $10\/each (unless you ordered special drinks). Hash hash definitely belongs to the Vegas strip.",4,0,1

Mom Salad (Bacchanal buffet for brunch so she decided to go light) - B very simple
Brother had the tractor driver combo - A++ for the ginormous pancake (my Mother and I realized even if he had a skinny frame he can EAT he ate about 95% of his food couldn't finish the last 2 bites of the pancake because that would've been pushing it.. so imagine if we didn't go the buffet for brunch...)

Chicken Benedict
FLAVOR was amazing! every bite was just mmmm good!  even the presentation is an A

After we had finished our meal our server asked if I needed a box so I can box them to go, of course I needed one! I couldn't get to even half of my meal! 

why I knocked off a star?? our server was EHH? checked on us during our meal once and had to look for her when our water ran out :(   My friends mentioned about a biscuit that they give out before your actual meal arrives?? NOPE..... DID NOT get any.. and if I  may recall correctly it was not even a busy night coz there were empty tables all around us except for 2. Maybe the next time I visit and go to Vegas I actually get to try those biscuits! maybe a high expectation  you might think, but I think its a matter of the actual experience as a whole you have as well specially when you visit a well known\/highly rated restaurant.

Everything on the menu has a little twist to it and it's just delicious food.  Understand that the portions are big, most meals can feed two people, so you may want to keep that in mind when ordering.  The problem with that though is you want to try everything!

Our kids love exploring the different casinos, and Imperial Palace is one even I had not been in to, now I know why.  The parking garage was gross, inside the casino was old and dirty, then upstairs in the Hash House it all looks good, but we soon found out it was not!

There were NO amazing Honey Biscuits, there was a 30 minute wait for the food, when it arrived it all lacked flavor... WHAT?  This cannot be the Hash House I love?  UGH!!

I have been to the West Sahara and also the M Resort locations, received amazing service and food PACKED with flavor, so go try those, but by all means AVOID the Imperial Palace location!!

They were even shooting a commercial, and WERE NOT BUSY, so I thought this would be a great experience, but it was terrible, and even after talking to the staff, nobody cared!

My recommendations at other locations:
Blue Crab Cake Hash- awesome crab cakes!!!
Famous Meatloaf Pasta- WOW good!
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower
The Tractor Driver Combo

Finally they opened one in Imperial Palace. The place is very modern. Steel walls, booths everywhere, colors are nice.  We had to wait to be seated since the host was never to be found.

The menu is basic but with a twist. They have all the fixins you would want in a breakfast menu. I recommend sticking with the breakfast items because THATS WHAT THEY ARE KNOW FOR!  They have everything from scrambles, to hashes, waffles, combo plates galore! What is nice is all the items come with skillet potatoes, fruit and a huge biscuit!

I ordered the corn beef hash. I have to admit the portion size was HUGE! I would have shared if Ive known they were that big! Everything was good. Potatoes were a bit dry egg was cold. During breakfast time you can only get scrambled eggs, which was WHACK!

Firstly, the chicken was luke-warm and dry like it were sitting out for a while. The waffles were much too doughy! (And here's a tip for the bacon; use bits, not strips if you're placing it inside the waffle.) The maple reduction didn't taste like maple, but some sort of teriyaki-based Asian sauce. Like I'm all for Asian-fusion, but this dish was a disaster. I choked back tears it was so bad. The only thing on point quite frankly was the fried leeks and the only saving grace of our dinner was the Arnold Palmer. I drank it like I was dying of thirst.

My biggest bone to pick was the speed of everything. 90 minutes to get in, okay, I get it. I live in Portland. I'm used to long waits for brunch. But once we sat down, about 15 minutes to get our drinks, another 10 to order, then we waited.

Almost an hour.

Then our food came. I was hot, good, and big portioned, but nothing mind blowing. Then we waited, and waited. And 20 minutes later we had our check. We put our cards in the little black folder on the edge of the table. Then we waited. About 15 minutes to pay.

All in, the experience was about two hours too long. If they paid attention to diners, the line would be shorter and I would have headed out happier.",1,0,0

something else i liked - they serve 40oz cans of budweiser and serve it with a side of bacon. ive said this a few times, but i dont really like domestic beer, unless its used for a drinking game. oddly enough, the bacon added to the flavor of the beer and it was actually pretty good!

So their serving sizes are too large. It's enough for at least 2.

The fried chicken was okay... not too crispy and kind of gave me that gross moist breaded chicken feeling. I didnt care for the Benedict sauce, the too thick biscuit, and the fact they used Scramble eggs instead of over easy....

Pros
-Staff was nice
-Beautiful, fantastic presentation of food
-Freshly squeezed tangerine juice  and lemonade good

Cons
-I got crab cakes, and there wasn't enough crab in it. It was mostly bread. Even though it was savory, there was no crab or seafood taste at all, and no chunks of crab at all. Disappointing for its steeper price of 24.99.
-My husband got the chicken and waffles. The skin was crispy and the food beautifully plated. However, it was very bland. The syrup was not sweet enough, the chicken not flavorful, nor the waffle exceptionally freshly warm or tasty or freshly slightly crispy on outside. It was cold and very ordinary tasting. In chicken and waffles, not all 3 elements can be bland and ordinary. One must be more stronger or flavorful, either a sweeter syrup, or a well flavored and marinated chicken, or a great waffle. It is possible for the other 2 elements to be ordinary if one element is done well. It was bland. To top it off, the chicken still had its bone. I usually don't mind, but on top of everything, another minus.

The ham was tasty! Seasoned great. And my eggs were cooked over easy per my request. My friends shared the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and let me take a bite. All the YAAAS! I see why it's so famous. The crunchy chicken, bacon mashed potato, biscuit & sauce were amazing! This dish is massive. I know I wouldn't be able to finish it on my own so if you have the appetite, go for it! Also tried a bit of the steak from my friend's Steak and Eggs. The steak was seasoned just right and cooked to my friend's request.

Service was so-so. Our waitress was curt but quick. She definitely hustled. Got our orders out quickly & handled our check fast as well. She did grumpily take our picture. It turned out cute so no serious complaints on service. 

The only thing I had to knock a star off was the restaurant itself. It felt cramped and it was HOT & MUSKY AF. They needed the air on in there especially with so many people crammed in. The staff was running around constantly. Felt busy and not relaxing like when I normally dine out. 

I'd still return if I was on this side of the strip. The food was too good to not enjoy again!

Fun fact, you can take your alcoholic drinks to go because duh, it's Vegas!",3,3,3

Yes, yes, I know, who doesn't like chicken?  Well, I don't.  But THIS chicken...the chicken and waffles is just AMAZING.  My boyfriend ordered it and I ended up eating most of his chicken because it was just so damn tasty.  The mix of herbs they put in there really infuse the chicken and make it taste like a bird that's flown in from heaven.  I thought the friend chicken here was inifintely better than Roscoe's (I know, blasphemy to some).  

Also, I usually can't eat more than a bite of pancakes.  But...the brown sugar banana pancake is also REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD here.  The pancake is pizza size, and the entire top is glazed with a crunchy brown sugar coating that pairs great with the pancake beneath.  Yum!

I got some kind of a sausage scramble (can't even remember which one) which was not really very great.   Also, the ""bacon waffles"" do have bacon embedded in them, but they disappointingly do not taste quite as good as they sound in theory.",0,0,0

My husband and I came here with the family and we both got different dishes to share. I ordered the granola waffles with eggs and a side of sausage. At first granola waffles didn't seem to appetizing but I wanted to try something other than the regular vanilla waffles. Every single bite of that granola waffle was yummy!! Every bite tasted fresh and not frozen. 

My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and that tasted fresh as well. The chicken was juicy, nicely seasoned, and did not taste greasy at all! 

This is a hot spot for tourists so if you're coming here I suggest you come early! We went around 11am and the waiting area was crazy! They are also remodeling the hotel so can you imagine we were like a herd of cattle waiting for our party to be called. I think for our party of 7 we waited between 30-45 minutes, but so worth it. Per our waiter, Lawrence- he said the best time to come is on Wednesdays. 

If you have kids, don't bring the strollers if you don't have to. Although the dining area is big, they ask that you leave your stroller behind the hostess area, which is pretty small.

For the amount of food you get, the price is totally worth every bite! Consider me a fan and next time I'm in town we're definitely eating here again!!",3,3,3

We made the epic trip down the strip to find this location. There seemed to be a huge lineup of people waiting for tables but we were told around 40 minutes for a table of 4. You're given your little buzzer (that doesn't work down on the casino floor) and then you wait. They both scream out your name and collect your buzzer, and if you're not there when they do so, off the list you go. Our wait was around that time but when it's 2pm and this is your breakfast, that time seems like an eternity.

Service was quite sparse, though our waiter was very nice. We placed our order for drinks and two came out right away, and the other two (bar beverages) took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes for a bottled beer and a margarita. Then we waited for our food and it must have taken close to an hour. The menu says that it make take a little while but after the wait for the table, this was a lot.

I got a burger, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and a side salad. The burgers are huge and very messy to eat. Have lots of napkins! The meat isn't seasoned and so really it's just a very big average burger. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I think that was my favorite part of the meal.

The other meals at the table were fine but nothing was seasoned very well and it was all kinda meh. Portions are unnecessarily huge and they'll gladly box your leftovers up for you. Again, it took a long time for the bill to come and so by the time we left, it was after 4pm.

I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was around the 13-20 $ range, I can't remember exactly. Portions were large and came out in a fairly decent amount of time. The only thing that ruined my experience was the rude redheaded host. We asked to be sat in a booth and she refused telling us that she absolutely could not. Now I could understand this if it was packed and busy, but it was 5 AM, and there was plenty of seating, not even half full!  I had to ask to speak to someone else and then we were seated 10 mins later in a booth. What really irritated me even further was that a party of three (same as ours) was seated in the booth in front of us by the redheaded host not even 5 mins later! I'm not sure if she was talked to by her managers. I shouldn't have to argue for a seat in a half empty restaurant.  

I will return again to try some different dishes since the first dish I ordered was delicious. I heard the chicken a waffles are a must here. I hope next time I get a polite host!

So we are here this weekend celebrating my fiancé 's 30th Birthday. The 1 place he was excited to go to and wanted to eat at was Hash House. What a poor choice!!!

Yes we understand it is Vegas and it will be busy but we ordered sandwiches and a biscuit, you guys are professionals, this should not be too difficult.  San Diego Hash House would never run this way.  

So once seated it took over 50 minutes to get our food, we watched at counted at least  10+ tables seated after us receive their food before us.  That  is insulting and extremely unprofessional. 

At minute 35 our server notices that we still do not have our food.  So he goes back to check only to return empty handed.  He does however makes mention our food is on the way out.  10 min later we still have no food but are reassured it's on the way out. The 3rd time he comes to the table he tells us that our prime rib sandwich is in the window but the manager will not let it leave the line.  He cannot tell us why our this is or why our order is taking so long.  He apologizes and tells us he put our food in at 2:09, it is now close to 2:55.  4th time to the table is tells us the manager is personally bringing our food out and that he feels someone grabbed our food by mistake. 5th time he returns with the manager ( wearing a red shirt today and when asked did not give his name), with our food.  We tell him how disappointed we were and that we were there trying to have a nice birthday lunch.  By now my finances food has been sitting in the window alone for at least 10 minutes, bread soggy and meat cold.  He seemed uninterested in our issue and said he would stand there to make sure our food was ok.  The prime rib was heat lamp well done but cold and the bread was soggy on the bottom and hard on the top.  So needless to say not ok.  The most disappointing aspect of this whole experience is the lack of caring.  Hopefully this is not a everyday occurrence at the Hash House and no one experiences what we did. 

 

-Presentation was horrible- not what I know of Hash House. 
-Taste was horrible- food sat too long and was not fresh as we know of the HashHouse
-Staff- our server was great and the manager did not seem to care.

The food, not so awesome. At all. 
I ordered a cobb salad with cucumber ranch dressing. It was huge, but not so flavorful. I kept looking for salty bacon and distinct red onion, and somehow, it was just bland. The tomatoes were good. *shrug*
The homemade biscuit was dense and insanely dry. Like, reminding us that we're in the middle of the desert and I'm desperately grasping the glass of water before my dried out throat shuts down on me.
I wrapped most of the salad up to go (not that death biscuit) because it's HUGE as the menu suggests, and took a slice of cheesecake to go, too. That was also enormous, and freaking flavorless. Well, not completely lacking flavor... It... It tastes like cream cheese brulee. Yeah. Almost burnt cream cheese. Not a hint of vanilla or sugar.

Me and my friend shared the infamous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict shown from Man vs. Food.  and omg... it was AMAZING!!!

The portion was big enough for us to share, but we had to buy a side dish or he would've charged us more to share since the portions are so massive at this place.  

The ONLY bad thing about this place (which is a pretty bad thing that I knocked it down 2 stars), was the wait. Holy moly.  We waited like 45 minutes for us to get seats.  When we finally got called, the restaurant was EMPTY!! Wtf.  Why were we waiting that long for a place that isn't even busy?! THEN, we waited another 45 minutes for the food! Keep in mind, we came here at 2pm, partied out all night the night before, and haven't even anything since before we partied! At 3:30pm, my friend was so hungry she ate a spoon of ketchup LOL.  They didn't even let us order appetizers ""because they don't do appetizers.""  -__-

It's the casino in hiding; used to have big street frontage which has been replaced with retail stores and is nothing more than a driveway entrance on the strip.  I find the casino tacky and loud (not in a good way) with its performing dealers dressed like Elvis, Marilyn etc.  They're more interested in performing than being good dealers.  That's a rant for another time.

There is almost nothing not to love about this place.  This experience is based on our mid afternoon ""brunch"" at a time when the restaurant had few patrons, as such we were seated promptly and our waitress prompt and very pleasant.

You have to love this operation; large menu, some weird combinations, HUGE portions and reasonable pricing.  I had Corned Beef hash with eggs ($12.95), potatoes, fresh fruit and a very good biscuit, served in a hot cast iron pan.  The CB Hash was great with the large chunks of meat and everything was delicious.  

Is this a great moment like when you're in a favorite restaurant and breakfast finally arrives?  No, this place makes dishes that are a happening.   I'd love to work my way through everything on their menu (I love breakfast) but this is an ""experience"" rather than a great meal.   No normal person (I'm a BIG eater) can finish what they serve.

From the moment we put our name on the wait list I should have known we were going to have a TERRIBLE experience. We were told the wait time was 45min to a hour, which obliviously  we knew that was to be expected since was being a busy Monday. We decided to wait at the bottom of the escalator because the waiting area was packed with people. We went back up 10 mins after to see if there was somewhere to sit in the waiting area. 30mins later they still haven't called our names, so we ask to see where our names was on the list. The hostess tells us they called our name long before and gave our table away and now we had to wait for another table. Strike one

Finally they seat us far in one of the back rooms. It was 1:20pm to be extact. Right when they sat us down, they try and rush to take our order, which irritated me to the max  because how could we possibly order when 1. We weren't even asked for a drink order, and 2. HOW COULD WE WHEN WE HAVEN'T EVEN OPEN OUR MENUS YET.
Strike two!

It was now 2:15pm and we still don't  have ANY FOOD. Our server Melissa,  which by the way coming from working in restaurant as a chef for over 10 years was JUST THE WORSE! She noticed  how upset we were because we still have no food, first thing she says was "" hey, I put the order in at 1:40 I don't know why it's taking so long"" she still has not asked us if we needed any refills or anything! Mind you we all had the first drink from when we first sat down. She comes to notify us our is ready just waiting on one plate and they cannot take out any food unless every plate is up. So She comes back with only one out of 7 plates. 5 minutes after   the other 6 plates still have not come out! What happened with their policy "" We can't take food out  unless everything was up "". Finally it's 230 and we finally get to eat, after being sat at a table for ONE HOUR. Then what happens, she messed up on two orders and my mom potatoes were cold. So it's pretty clear she forgot to put our food order in and was not taking the blame for it. Coming for a culinary background, the food was awful. Lack  SALT and seasoning! Their garnishes made absolutely ZERO sense, fried pasta noodles underneath the main entree?? What's the point there. At this point, I asked to speak to a manager, even the 1st time he came around concerning the cold potatoes he was useless! 
After finishing our TERRIBLE food, we found ourselves waiting AGAIN for a check! It took almost 30 MINUTES to get a check. We decided to walk to the front in hopes to get SOMEONE'S attention, we were then stopped by the hostess whom was very rude, she tells us our server was ""discounting our check"" Really??30 minutes to discount our check! And of course what did they add. GRATUITY. At that point I was so beyond pissed  I just wanted to get out of there! 
STRIKE THREE!

This place is ALL A HYPE, I  hate to  use my chef card, but after getting excuse, after excuse , this place is awful. Especially  the excuse our server have us when we were upset "" I didn't want to bother you guys because you guys looked really upset ""

Check back 15-20 minutes before your wait time is up because they can give you a better estimate then.

- Corned Beef Hash, red onions and swiss cheese: I don't normally like corned beef because it's too salty, but this dish was awesome!
- Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin with market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped with scrambled eggs: This was probably my favorite dish out of them all. The pork was crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside. The eggs and mashed potatoes complemented the meat quite well.
- Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit: This was also very bomb! That fried chicken-egg-bacon combo is awesome.
- Sage fried chicken with bacon-waffles: Bacon. Waffles. That was such a pleasant surprise! This dish came out last when we were completely full, but my group still devoured it like hungry kids who haven't eaten in a week.

It was a very nice restaurant with good food at affordable price, but our waiter, Sky, ruined our day. Here's the story:

After being seated for 10 minutes and waving my hand for 5 minutes no one came to take our order, so I had to ask a cleaner to get a waiter for us. Finally one waiter came, but he purposely ignored us and walked to a different table to talk to them (even though that table clearly didn't ask for him). Then he slowly came over, without introducing himself, and asked us what we wanted. I asked him how are you doing? He replied, ""just feeling RUSHED BY YOU, otherwise doing fine"". 

After we ordered, we waited for 30 minutes but nothing came. Even 2 tables that came in 10 minutes after us got their food. I had to leave my table and grab him to ask him what happened to our order. He replied, ""I have many other tables to take care of, and your dessert takes about 20 mins to prepare"". 1. Did we ever say that we want the dessert to be served at the same time as the main dishes? 2. We waited for 30 mins already! 3. Is he cooking our food? No. So why is him being busy making our food slow? Makes absolutely no sense. Since he never introduced himself, I asked him his name. The jerk LIED to me and said that his name was SCOTTY, but later I heard that he told other tables his name was SKY. 

By the time we got our food, the table that came 10 mins later than us already FINISHED their meal and left. We spent 2 hours without enjoying ourselves because of this one waiter. Hash House really needs to fire this guy so as not to waste the efforts of the chefs and other waiters\/ waitresses.

Watch out for this guy: we still don't know his REAL NAME. It could be SKY or SCOTTY or something else. He's a short, white guy. Avoid him all you can if they haven't fired him.",0,1,0

Each plate is a serving for two.  Yes you can order it for yourself, but I prefer to share.  

Only downside, the last time I ate here the eggs benedict were not poached eggs, actually it was scrambled?! WTF?!  I didn't ask questions, was too busy devouring my meal.

Nearly every item on the menu is too heavy, too big or too sugary to manage to eat it all. 

But first things first, the line for the tables is EXTREMELY long. I mean like 40 minutes at least. However, you can easily keep yourself amused the whole time by reading letters from famous people who ate there and loved it very much. There's also photos and articles from magazines. After you are called, the waiter leads you into a big room full of people and gives you big printed menu. The place was extremely busy the whole time, but the staff was great and we didn't have to wait too long to order or get food.

As I said before, the choice is overwhelming. Really! There's so many options that I could sit there for an hour and I still wouldn't be completely sure what to order. So I started with watermelon kivi lemonade. It was amazing! Very sweet, big and colorful and yet refreshing. I drank two of them. And a sweet coffee. So when we left I was on sugar rush :D. For breakfast we both decided on Farm Benedict. Mine was a bit on the lighter side, with smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, potatoes and roasted red pepper cream but my fiance went crazy and chose the version with crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin, market yellow tomato, spinach, potatoes and barb' que cream. Pork tenderloin. For breakfast. He's mad. The other reviews certainly don't lie, the portions are ENORMOUS. I honestly cannot imagine a person that would eat it whole. We could share one and we probably would still left some of it. The dish itself is a big mix of everything you could possibly want for breakfast all in one, layer after layer and topped wit crazy amount of sauce. It's a strange mix of flavors. I loved it but it was so heavy I can't imagine eating something like that more often than twice a month.

Food was piled high with a huge knife in it to help everything stand up. 

Chicken and waffles: had bacon cooked inside the waffles. Couldn't really taste the bacon inside too much, but it's a cool idea. Was great tasting, huge, chicken was tasty. Would definitely recommend.

Fried chicken benedict: To my surprise, I liked this dish a bit more than the chicken and waffles. Maybe because I'm more of a savory person though. I expected something like eggs benedict with some fried chicken on the side, but I got a mountain of .. everything. Huge biscuits, two huge pieces of fried chicken, bacon, tomatoes, spinach, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs .. all covered in some sauce (can't remember what the sauce was, but it was delicious). The skin of the fried chicken stayed crunchy even through the mess of everything in the dish. Was delicious. Share the leftovers with my husband at the airport for our quick dinner on the run.

He brought us hot biscuits to start and they are huge and the most delicious I have ever had. They are soaked in a sugary butter sauce that is amazing.

The food came and it was massive. My blt had so much bacon and lettuce that you had to cut it to be able to eat it. I chose the fries as my side and was glad I did. They are amazing and so crispy with seasoning.

My partner loved the chicken and waffles. The waffles actually have bacon in the middle of them and the chicken was crispy and delicious with just a hint of sage.

Our server quickly came over and coffee was brought promptly and kept filled. Hubby had a couple eggs, meat, and potatoes platter. Basic stuff since he's not a big breakfast eater. I had the smoked salmon Benedict. The picture doesn't do it justice, but this thing was as big as my head!  It was two eggs on top of grilled salmon on top of a homemade biscuit on top of a huge pile of griddled mashed potatoes. It was all covered with a chili sauce. Everything was done really well, but the sauce really was a bit bland.

Service was also fabulous! And the prices were very reasonable, especially since the meals are HUGE!

*I went with the BBBLT sandwich. One word...BACON! I loved this sandwich...fabulous bread too. 
*My boyfriend decided on the Chicken and waffles. It was literally a stack of fried chicken breasts and waffles (which had bacon baked into them). Yum!
*The Tractor Driver Combo - this comes with 2 eggs with bacon or sausage. You also get either one pancake, waffle or french toast. The person I was with went with the fren ch toast (she added brown sugar bananas on top). She was VERY happy!
*BLT Bloody Mary. This is basically a normal, spicy BM, but it comes with a few slices of bacon inside, a thick slice of tomato and a piece of buttered toast on the side. 

Note...this place is very popular, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 during normal breakfast\/brunch times. It's worth the wait though.

We didn't have to wait which was nice. 
Travis was our server. Super friendly and provided great service. 
I ordered the butterscotch pop latte and asked for it iced. When it came out, it was luke warm and didn't have a hint of butterscotch at all. Only drank about half of it. My husband ordered the hot chocolate. His was creamy and chocolatey.
I ordered the HH Original eggs Benedict. Mashed potatoes, biscuits, basted eggs, spinach, tomato and bacon topped with a roasted red pepper sauce. It was very esthetically pleasing, being huge and colorful with fried angel hair pasta sticking out if it and huge sprig of rosemary down the middle. Taste wise- meh. The red pepper sauce was virtually flavorless, the eggs were not seasoned, the biscuit was on the dry side. The mashed potatoes that it sat on top of were pretty much the best thing on the plate. There were only two slices of bacon on it also. The sides of the plate were smeared with Siracha. Wish the whole dish had been covered in it! 
My husband ordered eggs, sausage, and the apple cinnamon pancake. The pancake was huge and had at least half an apple worth of Granny Smith slices in it. Definitely better than my flavorless entree!

We were drawn to Hash House A Go Go because we saw it on Man Vs. Food and our jaws dropped and we had to go!  We were visiting Las Vegas for our wedding so we (my husband and I) had my parents and two friends along for breakfast.  The wait was insane, 1 hour and 15 mins, but we waited because we wanted to eat there so bad!  We sat, orders taken, beverages arrived- then we were ignored.  We were mesmerized at the huge plates walking past and our mouths drooled with excitement for our meal.  My father needed a water refill and the server completely soaked his entire leg and then preceded to attempt to help him dry off but then left and never came back to check on him or give him another napkin.  Food starts to arrive- 4 out of us got our food and my 2 friends were plate-less.  Finally after about 5 minutes of wondering what the heck is going on we flag down someone to find our server.  After about 5 mins she appears and we ask her where their food was...  Her reply, ""It just comes out when it's ready.""  Our response, ""That would've been nice to know...""  No apology???  After waiting another 10 mins and their food still had not arrived, the rest of us were done eating.  The food was good, but at this point it didn't matter if it was the best thing I ever ate...  I felt HORRIBLE for my friends whom had woken up at 6am and flew in that day- it was 1pm and they still had not eaten.  At this point they had no desire to pay for a meal that they weren't going to be able to enjoy with the rest of us.  The ""trying to find our server process"" ensued again...  Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock...  Order canceled, asked for check...  Waiting, Waiting, Waiting...  Check Dropped- I couldn't stand it and had to get out of there for a minute and took my time going all the way downstairs to use the restroom, upon arriving back at the table- she still hadn't been back to pick up the card to run it.  All 6 of us headed up to the front and finally got the host to find the server to run the card which was SERIOUSLY 10 minutes of waiting for that while I watched her run around the restaurant, take orders, do what ever- knowing that we were in the lobby OBVIOUSLY wanting to leave.  Signed the slip and asked for the manager.  I explained (the above) adding- ""I just want to inform you because it is pretty obvious that you were unaware that we even had an issue at our table because it was very apparent that we were NOT happy with our experience.""  Manager, ""Yeah I didn't know anything about it, guess I'll need to go talk to her.""  After 15+ years in customer service and 10+ years serving and managing restaurants...  This was in the top 3 of WORST experiences that I've ever had dining out.  HORRID!!!  And...

You can not go wrong when you can take an Lyft for 5 dollars from the Venetian and get to hash house in a couple of minutes. What was even better was the fact that there was no wait. My son and I were seated immediately and our waiter was amazing.

My son ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and I ordered the chicken and waffles. Please don't be fooled by the kids menu. When they brought my sons food out, the first thing I said was "" I'm sorry I ordered the KIDS pancake"" the waiter laughed and said "" that is the KIDS pancake"". The look on my sons face said it all. He immediately said ""Mom I'm not going to finish this"". I was almost scared to see what my plate would look like. I have been here before but it has been years, and boy was that  plate large. I also ordered the watermelon lemonade and it was amazing.

It was an hour and a half wait for a table, as pretty much everyone else on Yelp has mentioned, but we accepted that and went downstairs to gamble and peruse the shops. Once we were seated and eventually ordered, there was an hour and fifteen minute wait for our food to arrive. The waiter was a nice enough fellow, but perhaps overworked because once he performed a duty (taking our order, bringing ice water, delivering the food), he would disappear and we wouldn't see him for quite some time. On three separate times, we had to ask other waiters who just happened to be passing by to bring us something. My wife and I played it smart and ordered the chicken and waffles, thinking there's no way to screw that up. Right! We were happy with our meal, even sharing it between the two of us there was quite a bit leftover. The happy lad at the end of the table who ordered biscuits and gravy was equally satisfied. Then things got interesting: the lady to my left had a scramble with fairly raw, runny eggs, her husband had oatmeal with overripe fruit and no spoon to eat it with (and, of course, we couldn't find our waiter), and another young lady who ordered bread pudding found out too late that the bread pudding at Hash House A-Go-Go is Snicker's Bread Pudding, and had the consistency of a fairly large brick of fudge brownie. She had the lady balls to complain, and the waiter was willing to take it off the bill. If this review were based simply on my experience alone, I would say 4 stars.",0,0,0

Normally, when you order a multi-layer mountain of binge worthy food - the quality of each individual piece it's at its best but here it's the opposite! The chicken was moist and juicy, the breeding was crispy and flavorful with sage and sweet salty crunch.

i went with some friends who raved about how great this place was. two of the five of us went to get a table, and after waiting for 25 minutes, were told that we couldn't be seated until our whole group was here (which would have been helpful to know when they took down our names). even though the rest of the group was only 30 seconds away, we got knocked to the back of the queue.

all the while, i'm looking at the menu deciding what i want. i finally decide, and we are finally seated at 11:03, 40 minutes after we first got there. when we were seated, the waitress gave this huge intro speech about how great hash house a go go is and how everything is fresh and made to order and that nothing is pre-prepared. when i went to order the item that i'd been eyeing the whole time we were waiting, i was told that i couldn't have it because they switched over their menus at 11, even though we first got there long before. they also told me that i couldn't substitute anything, because there wasn't enough room in the kitchen to make everything to order.

now waaaaaaait a second. i though you just said that you make everything to order and that nothing is preprepared. i guess there are obviously exceptions to every rule. okay. fine. forget it. so i ordered a burger.

the presentation was spectacular, but fell short on taste and practicality. the patty was twice the size of the bun, and therefore the toppings were all over the place. it was impossible to get one single bite with all of the toppings in it. i had to cut off the excess patty just to figure out a way to raise it to my mouth. it was so greasy i had to wash my hands, face, and forearms after eating it. it was...meh. i didn't take the leftovers.

Time and Day: Came on a Friday morning around 8:30 AM and there was a 20 minute wait. The line moved fast so I didn't have an issue getting a table.  

Food: My fiancé and I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($19.99) and the Famous HH Smores Mocha ($8.99). Let me warn you now, the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles is massive. Both of us couldn't finish all the bacon waffles and we were both hungry. So with this warning, it is a lot of food and can easily split it between two people and three is you are not that hungry. Waiter\/waitress won't mind if you ask for another plate to split. Anyways, the chicken was delicious but not as good as what everyone was saying. In a blind test, I wouldn't tell a big difference between the chicken here and say Popeye's fried chicken. As for the waffles, it is a unique twist. Each waffle has bacon inside so combine with the syrup, you get sweet bacon & waffles. I like the idea but I can't imagine myself consuming this every time. As for the HH Smores Mocha, the melted marshmallow mixed with the mocha was amazing. However, once you eat all the marshmallow, you get a regular boring chocolate mocha. I wish I can get more marshmallow. Over, the food gets a (3\/5).

Service: Was not a good day to eat here because the service was incredibly slow. Our waiter apologized stating there was drama in the kitchen but it didn't stop me from being annoyed by it. It took 10 minutes to get menus and almost 15 minutes for water to come out. Food was noticeably taking a long time to come out and even though the waiter said our Smores Mocha would be coming out very soon, it didn't. It came after the entrée came and our entrée came almost 35 minutes later. Overall, service was slow and annoying. It is not the waiter's fault and I did appreciate his honesty with it. Service gets a (3\/5). 

Price: The meal was large and can easily split with two people. The price justifies itself here.

--2 ladies got the hash with basil, artichoke, etc.--they said it was cold and very very bland
--1 lady got the apple cinnamon flapjack--it was very tough and pretty much impossible to eat. it was also very dry.
--1 lady got the BBBLT-- she didn't like the bread, too thick
--I got the jalapeno guacamole burger--there was something bitter on this and I could barely eat it
--The last lady got the Rancher Eggs Benedict per the recommendation of the waitress. It was served with a BRICK of mashed potatoes underneath it. She kind of picked around everything, but it just looked like a soggy mess and wasn't appetizing...not impressed by something that was recommending. 


The prices were reasonable for the ammt. of food you got- everything was HUGE, but nothing was good. 

The only thing that I tried and liked was the biscuit that came with some of the hashes and the strawberry jam stuff for the biscuit, both were quite good. Again, the service was OK for as crowded as it was, but I wouldn't say the service was ""good"".

I wouldn't recommend this place and I wouldn't return.",2,2,1

However, our group was craving some hearty brunch food, so we decided to go here. In the middle of the casino floor, there's an escalator that leads exclusively to this restaurant. At the top, there's a waiting area and, further in, the actual restaurant.

We went around lunchtime and were told that it would be about a 30 minute wait. But luckily, a couple tables freed up earlier, and the hostess took us in halfway through our wait. We had to split up into two adjacent tables to go in earlier, but we didn't mind if it meant getting seated earlier.

Because I was so hungry, everything sounded so good and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I ultimately decided to get the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles since it was one of their special dishes. I also got the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.
- Yes, the portions are large. My dish was definitely big enough for two. I guess it's kind of a novelty, but they must waste a lot of food here. Most people probably get their own dish and aren't able to finish, which of course means it gets dumped into the trash. I feel like it would be more economical for both parties if they served smaller portions and charged a little less.
- The Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles were good, though. The sage flavor took the chicken up a notch from being your standard fried chicken. The waffles were cooked perfectly, and the pieces of bacon embedded in the waffles added a nice dimension to them without overwhelming with bacon flavor. If you're a fan of chicken and waffles, I think this dish is worth a try.
- Definitely get the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade! It was delicious! And it's so pretty when it first comes out. :)

Something funny about this place... They stick a sprig (or a few) of rosemary into everything. Just look around. Everything has a long sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. They must have a big basket of them in the kitchen that every dish passes by...

The food is awesome (some of the best I've ever had eating out) and the service was good, too.
I was surprised on how huge the portions were! And for the price, such a killer deal. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (which was served over mashed potatoes and topped with scrambled eggs.)

Then, the girl in the booth next to us had a seizure. Her boyfriend started dumping glasses of water over her head and she was not waking up. When she did finally wake up, she started vomiting at the table. I asked our waiter if we could be moved, but he said it was no big deal and the paramedics would be taking her away in s couple of minutes.
Then, a man came to our table that I assume is a manager at the restaurant and asked if we would like to move. We said yes, and as he was walking us to a different table, I slipped on the wooden floor and fell. Both my Bloody Mary and my water went flying as I went down. They helped me up and had the paramedics look at my arm (I broke my fall with it) since they were already there for the girl with the seizures anyways.
We noticed an immediate difference in the temperature on that side of the restaurant, it was much cooler. When our food came, one of the girls that ordered the Cobb salad asked for a side of BBQ sauce, and was told it would be an additional $1.25. She pointed out that the menu said it was included with the salad, so he brought it to her and the other person who had ordered a Cobb salad.
I had to ask them to replace my Bloody Mary and water that ended up on the floor.  The manager came over and I told him that we had asked to move from our table earlier, but the waiter had told us no. He said that wasn't his department.
We got the bill and it looked like I had been charged for both of my bloody Mary's, and the waiter smartly replied, ""that's why there  is a minus charge at the end."" They did not comp us for ANYTHING, even though we were traumatized by the whole horrible experience. We will never eat there again!

Farm Benedict ($18.99 USD)
Andy's sage fried chicken w\/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. Loved the sauce - had a nice kick. The sauce made the fried chicken lose a bit of its crisp and not to mention all the crispy batter pieces fell apart as I was cutting it. With all the food layers there is just too much going on for me.

Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($19.99 USD)
Fried chicken breasts with smoke bacon waffle tower, served with maple syrup and fried leeks. The fried chicken was a little dry - probably because it was chicken breast meat. The waffles were good though - liked how it had bacon inside. This signature dish was just ok imo, really relied on the maple syrup for flavor and to avoid the dryness.

Food portions were massive - I swear one dish was good enough for 2 people. Food taste was just okay, not quite worth the wait for me though.
Service wasn't the greatest. We waited quite a long time for our meals, and after our meals were served our waitress pretty much disappeared on us. None of the other waiters\/waitresses wanted to help out - they all avoided eye contact or ignored my hand waving at them.

My favorite was the chicken and waffles, the waffle was really tasty and the bacon infused syrup was amazing. On the other hand, my chicken 'Benedict' was a bit of a disappointment. I found absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it was't a Benedict ( it was fried chicken onto of a huge biscuit and mashed potatoes) and it was very one-note. Especially given the size, I found it hard to even make a dent in it due to the bland nature of all elements. The chicken was ok, but a little dry and did't have any distinct kick. The mashed potatoes just tasted like a baked potato that had been smashed with no flavor and the biscuit was good, just didn't really add anything to the big pile of blandness. There was a ton of sauce spread on top, I'm not entirely sure what it was, but it seemed like a gravy with some sort of spice added, but that too was surprisingly bland.

My cousin and I decided to walk from our hotel to Hash House A Go Go. Since this place had a reputation of serving large portions, we had to build our appetites. It was about a twenty minute walk from Treasure Island in the triple digit heat of Vegas. No sauna suit needed!

When we arrived, the waiting area was packed! Those who were waiting for a table made use of the mini-bar by the host stand. The mini-bar served their famous bloody marys and screwdrivers, for a price. As I went to put my name down for a table, the wait was estimated for a thirty to forty-five minute wait.

Once we sat at the bar our server\/bar tender, Jeanette, assisted us. She took our drink orders and I chose to get a screwdriver. After placing our drink orders, we started browsing through our menus. Everything looked good on the menu, but due to stomach limitations, we ordered the following:

- Sage chicken and waffles that include, Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks

- Farm benedict with hammered crispy pork tenderloin with market yellow tomato, spinach, bbq cream and topped with scrambled eggs.

The screwdriver was pretty strong for my empty stomach and gave me a light buzz. As our food was brought to us, the medley of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", was playing in my head. These portions were ginormous! To make sure we experienced the best dining experience at Hash House A Go Go, we switched off on eating our dishes. The tenderloin and fried chicken were both crispy. The waffles with the fried chicken were kind of soggy due to the oil of the fried chicken. The gravy, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuits were a great blend of must have breakfast items.

These monstrosities destroyed our hunger pangs! The service from our server\/bar tender Jeanette was great! My first time here was a great experience.",4,4,4

And ever since I was introduced to Hash House A Go Go on an episode of Man vs. Food, I knew someday I would have to make a pilgrimage and tackle their ridiculous, over-the-top tower of chicken and waffles meant to feed a family of 4 but served to one person as their entree. Check that off the bucket list now.

Being a Monday afternoon, my buddies and I thought it would be a breeze to get in quickly for a table. But we would be wrong once we got to the top of the escalator and saw people lined up on the benches outside. I put my name on the list for an estimated 45 min wait. No matter, the craps tables downstairs would keep us busy in the meantime.

We made it just in time to hear our name called and sat down. No need glance at the menu. I wanted the famous Sage Fried Chicken stacked with bacon waffles, drizzled with hot maple caramel reduction, and crowned with fried leeks. I was the first to order at the table, but the final one to receive their food. Apparently, there were 5 other chicken and waffle orders ahead of mine. The wait was almost torture. 

The behemoth entree was finally brought before me and all I could say was ""Wow"". It was an impressive sight. A skewer and long knife stabbed through the top kept the whole thing upright. I removed both of them to break down the tower piece by piece. I have to say the chicken, two healthy thigh pieces, were succulent as hell. The batter with sage was crackly good. Very impressed. The waffles were OK. Bacon does make everything better but couldn't combat the somewhat dryness of the waffle. Some dousing of the extra maple reduction would help with that.

The short version: Rejected dive hotel buffet scraps recycled at a Hash House A GO GO.

There were 6 of us in town for my bachelor party weekend. As a fan of San Diego's Hash House I happened to convince my party to check out HH LV at the Imperial House. The service was the absolute worst with the consensus on the food being mediocre (mediocre only because some had nothing to compare Imperial Palace Hash House to). It was so bad that I need to write a review.

Here's how it went:

Fist, ever sit for breakfast after a night of hardcore binging only to yell your order to the server? The loud music became very apparent when the waitress felt compelled to ask, ""huh,"" ""what was that,"" ""can you repeat that,"" for just about all six of us at the table. This was a problem for the hung over amongst us. 

Next, a friend whom doesn't eat meat asked for a substitution for the ham, sausage and\/or bacon options. She politely says to him, ""No, I'm sorry. We don't really substitute here. Usually people will order their food and just not eat the meat."" The friend of mine follows with, ""soooo, no fruit... nothing?"" ""No,"" she replies, ""sorry."" 

This was a bummer for a person who's never experienced the real deal Hash House. Sadly, it continues downhill.

We order our food. I got the Basic Breakfast which included eggs (I asked for over-medium) with bacon, potatoes and a side of biscuits and gravy (layoffa me I was starving!!). A couple people ordered the chicken (dry) and waffles while others had omelets and various other items. Two of us receive partial meals while others had complete orders delivered. At this point in time, the ice water's are dry while our server is MIA (she was overly chatty with the two\/three tables she serviced). I received my side of biscuits and gravy and continued to wait for the rest of my food. Two others at the table sat without any food or water. Then the rest of my food comes. Low and behold, the eggs were undercooked (perhaps she would have heard me say over-medium had the music not been so loud?). The clear slime made the eggs inedible. The bacon was tiny, shriveled and cold (SD HH is huge, thick-cut deliciousness). The potatoes were not Hash House rosemary style potatoes. Rather, they were dive-bar buffet status potatoes that sat under a heat lamp for hours and far too hot to eat. Then, I discovered the clear like gelatin chunks in the only thing I thought to be edible, the biscuits & gravy. This was utterly disgusting. Meanwhile, as most of us are more than half-way through our breakfasts, we realize two of us at the table had yet to receive their meals.

Finally, our server breaks away from her story telling at other tables to check on us. I informed of the two missing meals. She runs in to check in the kitchen and comes back with our order slip and asks us what we're missing. She falls back to the kitchen; comes back to apologize, and carries on to her other tables. In the end, we get our meals while I borderline on losing my cookies all over the table. The server only deducted my meal from the bill and we happily leave the joint.

This particular Hash House A Go Go is located inside Imperial Palace (eek!). It was pretty busy when we walked in, so we expected to wait for a good hour. The hostess quoted our party 45 mins. to an hour, which isn't too bad, unless you're hungover and starving...which we all were. Luckily, since there were so many people, some parties decided to leave, which meant that we only had to wait about 20-25 minutes! 

We ordered:
-Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles
-Bacon Waffles
-Corned Beef Hash
-Biscuits and Gravy and Scrambled Eggs

The bacon waffles were sweet and there were pretty generous slices of bacon inside. I wish I had ordered the waffles with some strawberries on top just to give it a little more sweetness - the syrup just wasn't enough! I didn't taste any of the other dishes, since I was so occupied with attempting to finish mine, but everyone definitely enjoyed their food.

Our server did his best with the crowds - it was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't expect stellar service anyway, I just wanted to eat. You are definitely in for huge portions and a lot of food so if you're on a budget or aren't TOO hungry, I'd suggest sharing or you'll end up with some leftovers.",3,1,2

I have a platinum rewards card so we skipped the wait (which looked ridiculous) and were seated in less than 5 min. Even though that was speedy, it took about 45min for us to get our food after we ordered.

The taste of the food was good, which was probably the best part of the meal. It wasn't amazing but it was better than decent. We had the sage chicken and waffles, sage chicken benedict, and the smoked salmon scramble. The waffles were okay; I wish they had bacon bits throughout the whole thing instead of bigger pieces of bacon. The mashed potatoes that came with the Benedict were really good. The scramble was a little fishy but still good. 

I guess the portion sizes were reasonable\/a really good deal for the price, but I feel like it would even be good if the prices were halves and the portions were halved. No one finished or even ate half of their meal, and I was eating with two pretty hungry guys who know how to eat. I feel like we wasted so much food because we took it to go and even though we ate some of it later, it wasn't as good and we didn't finish it. We all also felt really sleepy and tired after. I think it would be good hangover food but we weren't hung over lol

If you eat here, definitely share. One entree will feed 2, maybe 3 people. I have no idea how it would be possible for one person to finish one meal. 

I'm not sure if I would come here again. It wasn't a terrible experience but it wasn't the best either. I liked it more than I disliked it.",3,0,1

I had the famous fried chicken Benedict and it was just ok. I wish it was smothered in gravy versus the chipotle sauce used. The fried chicken was cooked well and the breading was bomb. The chipotle sauce was only OK and overpowered the fried chicken. I loved that it was served over biscuits but would have preferred the potatoes on the side versus under. It got mushy. I almost wished there was more sauce or something, the biscuits were really dry.

My boyfriend ordered the meatloaf. That was really good. They slice the meatloaf and crisp it up. The flavor was really good.

We also got an iced pistachio mocha, you could really taste the pistachio flavor. Would recommend to any pistachio lovers. My boyfriend barely made a dent in his caramel mocha and got jittery! He rarely gets jittery too so watch out for that!

All in all the huge portions make this a fun place to go to. Service is great and the menu is brimming with fantastic items that are sure to impress. We came with leftovers for dinner. A great bang for your buck. You could split a dish too if you don't like leftovers and get an even better deal!

Our waiter cane right away and explain all about the menu being that it was our first time.

Stayed at Imperial Palace for a recent convention and ate at the HH each of the three mornings. Tried to give another place a shot but it was as if a giant pork covered magnet was pulling me in.

Their coffee rivals any Starbucks\/coffee house. Seriously. It's hot, it's dark and it's good stuff. No need for sugar or cream, just man up and drink it like it was meant to be drunk.

My first breakfast was a chorizo, jalepeno, tomato, cheesy hash and it was fantastic. Potatoes in the hash are perfectly crisp. Over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and served with a fluffy biscuit and fruit. Wonderful, homemade jam sits at every table.

Second day I went with The Basic which is 2 eggs, potatoes, fruit and a biscuit. I added bacon for an extra $2.50. I probably should have left the bacon off as it was a little disappointing. I know, I know. Bacon? Disappointing? Not sure how those two words could ever be uttered in the same breath but my two strips were melded together and a little overdone. Reminded me of the bacon in the cafeteria of the hospital I work in. Pre-cooked and piled into a metal pan and heated on the grill for each order.

Last morning was a Saturday morning and the place was slammed so I sat at the bar. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy breakfast which comes with two eggs, fruit and mashed potatoes. I really wanted to order according to menu and try the mashed potatoes but those crispy potatoes are sooooo good that I made the substitution for the mashed. Tasty gravy with nice big chunks of sausage!

All the dishes are nicely arranged and garnished. Each morning my biscuit came with a sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. Nice touch.

The atmosphere is pleasant with good music being piped in. Wait staff is friendly and service is fast. On the morning I sat at the bar for breakfast, the bartender asked if I drank and I replied to the affirmative. (Hello!?  Is this not Vegas??!!)

While the decor is nothing special it's still a world away from Imperial Palace!

Back to the food-- please come to Hash House A Go Go hungry. Not a little hungry, not ""oh I can still eat"", come STARVING. The portions here are out of this world and even though we're usually pretty big eaters, not a single person finished their plate.

Eating at Hash House A Go Go really took the terms ""stuffing my face"" to a whole new level. Unfortunately, to my best efforts, I was only able to finish about 1\/4 of my meal. 

I also ordered the wine spritzer and loved it. Didn't taste a hint of alcohol. Eva, Denise and Mr. Dubs all ordered the Bloody Mary and it was delicious too but watch out-- they ask you what type of vodka you want in your Blood Mary but doesn't mention that there is an extra charge for the premium vodka! I guess it should've been a given since we are in Vegas and it is ""premium"" but the way the options were given were very misleading.

About 6 dollars but I would recommended it and also order it again. My friend got the large apple juice which was also very good. Tastes more authentic than average grocery store apple juice.
 I ordered essentially the vegetarian hash. Lots of veggies, over cubes of hash brown with your choice of stylized eggs. About 15 bucks. To be fair in my opinion, it wasn't worth 15. It was just scrambled eggs, veggies, and a huge biscuit. I ate about 1\/4 of my food. It was not gross but nothing to gloat about either. Just average. Way better than a Denny's though.

Luckily I went here prior to the failed attempt mentioned above and this place was all that I had imagined during my extensive research prior to visiting. The experience starts with the super sweet, almost overly accommodating host (whose name I can't remember). We tried to get a table for 8 but couldn't because there were only four of us present which was a little irritating but also understandable. He told us we could either wait for the others before we were seated or get seated and then move to a larger table once they came. We opted to be seated and figured we could just be separate because the others were only planning on drinking anyway. 

The drink that I got (Champagne cocktail of some sort) was ok but nothing noteworthy. My friends had some of the other cocktails (one blue one and one with watermelon) and they raved about them. Three of us ordered the chicken and waffles which was definitely a mistake because one order could have fed us all! Ok, maybe not three people but it definitely could have fed two people with moderate appetites especially if you got something else like we did. I guess it's not the waiter's job to tell you that you're ordering twice the amount you need nor do I know if they would have allowed us to split it but I do wish the option was there. The food was absolutely amazing though! The chicken was super crispy like I like and the waffles were sweet and the bacon added to the taste. My friends ordered mashed potatoes and they were good too. The next day one of my friends went back and ordered the signature Fried Chicken Benedict and said it was amazing as well but also too much for one person.

I'd definitely suggest Hash House if you're in the area

They claim this is Indiana food and for the most part they have a ton of Indiana favorites.  Keep in mind, the food is very tasty and that is why I'm still giving it an A-OK rating but the portion sizes are seriously offensive.  Each order can feed 3 people.  I'm not even kidding.  This is an obscene waste of food as no one at my table even made dents by the time we were finished.  Multiply that times their 10? locations and the fact they are on an hour wait pretty much constantly and open 24 hours and I shudder to think of the food wastage. 

I'm guessing the large portions is part of the appeal here, but the flavor was REALLY good...I honestly think if portions were cut in half, and kept at the same high quality standard, this place would do exceptionally well still and hell..probably make a lot more money not spending so much on food.

I'm glad I got a chance to cross this off my Vegas list, but I would not plan on returning.

Also, our service was sub-par here which I assume is due to the freakishly busy nature of this place.  Still worth mentioning.",1,0,0

I found this place on google and after so many good yelp reviews I placed it on the ""TO EAT LIST"". The hubby and I woke up early Friday morning and did our morning stroll of the strip (walking from Mandalay all the way to this location to work up our appetite). This location is located in the back of the Harrah's hotel which can be confusing because it notes on here that it is near the Linq. The wait here on a Friday morning at 9am was long! I guess I wasn't the only one that had done my research. I placed our name on the list and was told it would be a 25 to 30 minute wait. The hostess informed each guess that you could purchase a bloody Mary while you waited. Also, the restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for its patrons, so if you need to go I would suggest going before you eat-- you have to go down the stairs around the corner and through the woods (jk on the woods part) to get to the restroom. Finally after waiting we were called and placed at a very nice looking booth. The breakfast menu looked so good the hubby and I didn't know where to start. The menu prices are also very reasonable-- so there is something on here for everyone. My husband ended up ordering the Basic meal and the house strawberry shortcake, while I opted to try the famous chicken and waffles, a side of bacon, and a side of eggs. Also what's being in Vegas without ordering a drink for breakfast!?? I ordered the spiked Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade, which was AMAZING!!! If I could I would start a lot my mornings with this drink! It took a little while for our food to come out (25 minutes or so) but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since they had a packed house. My husband enjoyed every bit of his meal. My plate of chicken and waffles was MASSIVE. There was no way I was going to be able to finish it on my own. I enjoyed my waffles and chicken but I felt the fried chicken could have been seasoned a little better. My husband really enjoyed his strawberry shortcake as well.

1) You are going to have to wait. Not only for the long line which seems to be the norm, but also for the food.  The waitress will tell you ahead of time that they make all their food fresh and it'll come out as soon as it's done so it won't sit under heat lamps or anything. From the time you order, the wait could be equal to if not more than the wait to get seated.

2) HUGE portions. It'd be safe to order one thing for every two people since the portions are so huge. Unless you were as hungry as I was, in which I nearly killed my whole plate.

I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was amazeballs.  Biscuits, fried chicken, eggs, cheese, bacon, chipotle gravy...not much to complain about.  I was going hard at it but hit a wall with probably 1\/4 left.  This was also called the Man vs Food dish.

The eggs were perfect, the crispy potatoes were great (they aren't hash browns. The waitress told us they don't carry hash browns), the biscuit was huge and they did give me strawberry jam so I don't know what the person below means about no jelly. 

The only problem we encountered why my boyfriend's bacon was a little dry but as soon as he told the waitress, she came right back out with new bacon and he said it was perfect. 

Speaking of the waitress, she was wonderful. i believe her name was Heather if the management happens to read this. She answered  my questions and explained everything in great detail so I really knew what my options were. She had a great demeanor and was probably the best waitress\/waiter I had in Vegas.

We decided to stop by before we left to go back home. We arrived at 930 and only waited about 5 minutes before getting seated (this is a first). There were maybe 3-4 other groups waiting at that time. This place is 24\/7 now!!

The drinks are pretty pricey. Fresh squeezed juice can get up to $7 and a their coffe drinks to $8. I opted for their watermelon kiwi lemonade..doesn't it just sound delicious?? This was $5.50 and so refreshing. My friend ordered the hazelnut latte, which was also very delicious. It's not too sweet and the whip cream on top is so yummy. Maybe they do have a reason for pricey drinks! 

It took us awhile to finally order our food because there are so many choices...and so little stomach room. I ended up ordering the Corned Beef Hash. This came with corned beef, onion, swiss on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs, and a bisquit. It was a pile of cheesy beefy starchy goodness. My only complaint was that I asked for the eggs to be cooked over medium well but.. they were pretty much cooked through. I like the white to be cooked, but the yolk still runny.   

My friend ordered the Chorizo Hash and this came with chorizo, cheddar cheese, jalapeno, and tomatoes on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs and a bisquit. I had tried this before on another visit and recommended it to my friend. There's just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos and not too greasy from the chorizo. Very delicious. She ordered her eggs the same way, and it came out perfect!

Went in a group of 7 out-of-towners. Despite the pleadings of one of our members that sharing might be a good idea, we each ordered individual dishes. We should have listened...

The sage fried chicken and waffles was the most popular dish at the table. 3 of us ordered it, myself included,  and everyone got a taste. The chicken was nicely fried, with perfectly crisp skin. I could have stood for it to be a little moister but that's nitpicking. You get two good size white meat pieces to go with your 4 bacon-Belgium waffles. Yes, the bacon is baked INTO the waffles. Brilliant.

I got to taste one of their giant flapjacks, as well (Snickers flavored). Fluffy and flavorful. That's the way to do it.

The server and other waitstaff helping out was very friendly and handled our large group well, including a late drink order change.

Drinks, yes, we had some, a variety of mimosas, a strawberry margarita, a BLT bloody mary. I wasn't overly impressed with my mimosa (I went with a lemonade one) but I ended up switching with someone who had a pineapple mimosa and we were both happier. The BLT bloody mary literally comes with a mini BLT. You just have to put it together yourself.

And all of that food was NOT terribly expensive. This is a great value on the strip. You easily get at least two, if not 3, meals out of each dish, and, with reasonable prices to begin with, that means more money in your pocket to chase straights or split your eights.",0,0,0

I had the sage fried chicken in penne pasta. The chicken was pretty much flavorless. I could not taste the sage flavor or even the chicken flavor in this fried chicken. The penne pasta was just a bland cream sauce that was nothing special. 

My dad had the corned beef hash and he said that his food was flavorless. We saw that everyone else was taking their food home because they thought it was good however, we thought... no need to take some flavorless food home.

I had chicken pot pie and while some of the clientele in the casino below rendered me speechless, this for sure shut me up.  All I can say is it was big and it tasted soooo good.   Large chunks of chicken, flaky warm crust, fresh veggies...oh my.  

I honestly can't remembered what everyone else ordered.  My eyes never left my plate.  And the table was pretty damn quiet once all the food showed up.  

But what I do remember and know is that our waitress was the bomb, the food was well worth the price of admission and I can't wait to get back to the Hash House.",2,1,1

There are a lot of meat options and the portions are quite generous, but in terms of food quality and price, a place like Denny's is a much better deal.

The all blue crab cake with angel hair pasta and basil pesto ($11 appetizer) was basically a huge pan fried crab cake on top of a pile of pasta about the same size as the crab cake. The Boston Hash ($15) had an identical all blue crab cake, with crispy potatoes and two eggs. The potato hash was quite good, but both crab cakes were barely warm - two sides were slightly brown, but the inside of one crab cake was actually cool, as if it hadn't been defrosted before they'd thrown it in the pan. The sunny-side-up eggs were also quite sad. Gordon Ramsey might describe one of them as ""so raw it's about to fly away.""

I also tried two sandwiches. The grilled portobello mushroom sandwich ($13) was okay, except for the soggy bun and the barely-there goat cheese. The meat in the crispy pork tenderloin sandwich ($14) was very large but very thin; as a result, the pork was very dry and half of the meat was crispy batter. Also, since the meat had such large diameter, you couldn't actually eat it like a sandwich - you had to first eat only the meat and work your way toward the part actually covered by the bun and condiments. But by the time you reach the bun part, you won't even feel like eating any more. It'd be better if the meat was thicker with a smaller diameter, so it didn't dry out while deep-frying.

Overall, nothing was really satisfying, especially after we saw the bill... Th server was great, really friendly, but that couldn't redeem the pitiful meal.",0,0,0

The chicken was a bit dry and the mashed potatoes were bland. I also ordered a side of fried potatoes and sausage gravy, which ended up being uneaten because there's already so much food for one entree. Definitely don't recommend the fried potatoes though. They don't have much flavor to them.

My friends split the Chicken and Waffles and that was definitely a good idea. I really have no idea how one person can consume that much food in one sitting! The waffles were very soft and doughy, if you like that. I do so I really enjoyed them!

And after perusing their menu, the mouth-watering descriptions of their food certainly fired up my imagination. I could barely wait to see what exactly they would serve up. We showed up to the Quad, and saw the line was already building even at the early hour we arrived. We were quoted a 40 minute wait, and waited exactly that long.

We were seated quickly, and our server was friendly. I ordered the chicken & waffles, and she ordered the fried chicken benedict. For some reason, our server warned us saying it would take upwards of 30 minutes to produce my dish. Not sure why -- she said it was busy. But come on -- it's fried chicken. Doesn't take that long to cook, and if a freaking Vegas restaurant that specializes in the stuff doesn't have it dropping in the fryer every minute, well shoot. 

Thirty minutes pass, and our server produces two massively towering plates of food. Four waffles (with bacon in between), two chicken breasts, stabbed with a knife to hold it all together. Lots of sage garnish (of course, sage-fried chicken and all). It looked impressive. Unfortunately, the impressions ended there. Mediocre waffles -- even the bacon couldn't save them. Even more mediocre chicken -- flavorful and seasoned, for sure, but undercooked. Not raw undercooked, but rather, the breading was still doughy and not fully crisp. It was fine and all, but considering I paid $20 freaking dollars for it, totally underwhelming. I spent the entire time looking on at her dish, which looked and tasted considerably better than mine.

If you're a fan of Roscoe's and the like, don't expect the same here. It's all glamor and glitz, and no substance at all. If the dish were half the size and minus all the garnish, it could've actually been decent. Even more so if it didn't take so freaking long to serve.

I ordered a Scrambler with smoked salmon, basil pesto, tomato and melted brie cheese, and it was amazing! Loved it!

Location ~ It was an easy walk from where we stayed at (Vdara) especially since we were able to walk the strip and see all the stuff along the way.

to absorb all that alcohol still coasting through your body. The wait here can be horrendous, especially during brunch hours so either make reservations or bring a snack with you lol.

Btw, If you have ATT&T, you won't get phone reception so save your mobile photo uploading for later.

Because it's so busy, the service seems to suffer a little bit, we asked
Several times for drinks, utensils etc before they actually brought them out. So minus a star for that. Also, the tables are positioned unusually high. I suppose it puts your mouth closer to the food, so that cant be a bad thing.

The menu is large enough for varying tastes, but they do offer Andy's sage fried chicken with either waffles, benedict, pancakets etc. We ordered the sage fried chicken benedict, sausage gravy pot pie and bacon waffle. 

The wait for the food seemed like forever. Well it literally was. I believe it took approximately 40 minutes from the time we placed the order til its arrival to our table. Luckily we were so astonished by the size of the platters that all complaints dwindled away quickly.  The plates are massive, enough for a number of people to share. 

Sage fried chicken benedict was delicious, a bit heavy handed on the sauce but every aspect of that plate was super good. The sausage pot pie was impressive looking but you the biscuit dish spaceship thing was really hard and almost crackerlike. Not what you would expect from something named ""pot pie"". Tons of sausage though and the gravy was bomb. The bacon waffle was a bit of a disappointment. I thought there would be bacon pieces integrated with the batter, so you'd get a hint of saltiness in every sweet bite, but unfortunately it was whole bacon pieces that were dressed in waffle. If that makes any sense.

I hear the bloody mary was awesome, and like their meals, they serve it large.

Overall, my biggest issue was the sloth-like nature of the service. The food itself wasn't spectacular as you would hope, but definitely impressive enough for a second or third visit. (Photos to follow)",6,6,5

Plus, the prices are very reasonable by Vegas standards... $15-$20 for an enormous plate of food. 

But being a good value isn't enough to earn a high rating from me; the food has to be good. I was half expecting the food to be more show than substance, but I was mistaken. The food at Hash House is excellent. I had the Tractor Driver combo with bacon, scrambled eggs with goat cheese, and the banana brown sugar pancake. Everything was fantastic. The bacon and scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. The pancake was deliciously sweet. I wanted to gobble it all up, but the pancake was the size of Texas.

Everything served here is typically so huge you cannot finish it.  My husband and I easily polished off the chocolate Snickers bread pudding though.  Don't get me wrong, it was big but two people can easily finish it if you like bread pudding.

This was one of the best bread puddings I have ever tried (best is still at Famous Dave's).  Each bite was different.  I never knew if the bite would taste more like bread, like chocolate or like a Snickers bar.  I really enjoyed that aspect.  It was also served with a very generous scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was just the right amount to have some with each bite of pudding.  The only thing I wish they would do different would be to use hot fudge drizzle on the plate instead of cold chocolate syrup.

I also had a cup of coffee and I thought it was very good.  I tend to be a picky coffee drinker and thought their brew was very rich and super hot (double bonus for me).

Will definitely return for dessert.  We also can't wait to try the dinner menu.  The mashed potatoes look outstanding with what looked like broiled cheese and bacon on top.

I have had the 1 lb. stuffed burger here multiple times. Note: Before attempting, skip breakfast & lunch. I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. 

I had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled mashed potatoes with bacon, and two eggs w\/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. Once again, the dish was huge. The chicken breast was magnificent. The biscuit was flaky and huge. I could not finish. I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. 

Hash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It's hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric).

30 MINUTE LATER...I see our food come out of the kitchen...and...head straight to a different table...We try to flag down the guy bringing it out as the table tells him yes they ordered chicken and waffles but not biscuits and gravy but before we can get his attention he drops the chicken and goes back to the kitchen with the biscuits. 

Add 20 minutes to that and they manage to sort out what has happened (try getting a server's attention in that time) and we get an apology and finally a coffee refill. Keep in mind tht the table who got our food had another order for the lady and she had to watch her man eat for the 20 minutes before her food came out.

I will give them this...the food was orgasmic. ORGASMIC. the chicken was amazing and the waffles had friggin' bacon cooked right into it. Right into it! The biscuits and gravy were omgnom or whatever the kids are saying these days.

The wait for four was about 30 minutes on a Mother's Day Sunday. But after getting and seeing the food others are eating, you start to salivate, anticipating what you're going to order.

Be afraid of the portions, because they are LARGE. You may notice that their plates are more like serving platters and their portions fill each plate (platter).

I had one of their scrambles and it was the smallest plate. Their BBBLT sandwich may contain a 1\/2 lb. of bacon and the bread is at least 1-1\/4"" thick! If you order the french toast, you'll get two large pieces of tasty delight and the fried chicken is very very moist but keeping the skin crunchy.

Prices range in the $15 - $20 range, but are large (LARGE) enough to share... unless you are the UNLV football team.

The sage chicken & waffles were amazing.  Husband and son consumed their entire plates of....some unusual but oh-so-original concoctions.  Everything is homemade and so original in thought.  Flavors are great.  Our server's knowledge of the menu was A+
4 stars and not 5 because there is a wait most times, they overhead page you for your table-meaning you have to stay nearby to hear it, the staff all seem hurried (probably due to the waiting customers,) and there was a whole lot of fluff on our plates that we didn't need (tomato slices...sage\/rosemary sprig.)",0,0,0

But, this Hash House experience was not as good as to our visit at the West-side location (6800 W Sahara Ave).  And, this location is kinda odd... basically a windowless attic in the Imperial Palace.  And, while the food was pretty good, it was inconsistent.  Worse, the service was definitely lacking.  I'd say overall 2.5 stars.

Service - 2 stars
The server had a nice demeanor, sort of Southern-friendly like, but his recall and follow-up were poor.  For instance, he totally forgot to order two of our drinks & one of our meals.  We also waited a VERY long time for everything... drinks, food, & check.

Chicken & Waffles - 2 stars
Good, but again not as good as the West-side location.  The waffles were not fully cooked (making them very heavy) and maple reduction sauce was too light to compensate.

Meatloaf Sandwich w\/Cheese - 4 stars
A touch dry, but very tasty.  It came sandwiched between this crazy big bread (think Texas Toast on steroids.)  Fun to look at, but you couldn't taste much else but bread.  Flung the ""discus of bread"" onto another plate.  After that, the open-face style was much better.  

Stuffed Hamburger - 2 stars
Again, fun to see delivered.  But, the meat (two huge patties - like manhole covers) were pressed too thin, making them well-done & dried out.  Also, that burger meat quality was so-so (think basic McDonald's burger, but much bigger)

Big O' Roasted Butternut Squash - 4 stars
Unique dish... Squash stuffed with risotto and crowned with fried portabello mushroom and served with an ear of corn on the cobb.  But, it was huge carbo-load.  Two people could not finish it.

Overall, if you've never been HHAGG, it's fun to check out.  But, with all the uber-great restaurants in Vegas, we'll probably not return here.",0,0,0

The restaurant is located on the upper level of the LINQ Hotel & Casino. The decor is what I'd call a modern farmhouse style. Picture lots of wood and rustic elements mixed with silver metals. I like that particular style, so I felt right at home. 

The portions here are enormous! Neither my husband nor I could could finish even half of our plates during either visit. The dishes are shareable, which I highly suggest if you're coming here with children. They offer a large variety of menu items. A few of the items we've tried from the menu are chicken & waffles, traditional pancake\/egg\/bacon breakfast, grilled salmon with goat cheese mashed potatoes, and blue cheese stuffed burger and fries. All were very delicious! 

One thing to make note of if you plan to enjoy some of these huge portions yourself... Breakfast usually has a long wait, while lunch and dinner do not. Enjoy!",7,2,5

The big drawback to this location is there is presently a ton of construction going on in front of the hotel and it makes it very difficult to enter the hotel and even find the self parking.  If you plan on visiting this location, allow yourself the extra time to get to where you need to go.  Now, onto the review:

We arrived at the restaurant at approx. 10 am on Tuesday, November 12, 2013 .  Big thing for them is they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  This makes complete sense since the space is limited and they don't want one single diner to hold up a potential table for others while they wait for the rest of their party.  I appreciate this rule and the hostess are very polite when they share this rule.

We (me and my 3 friends) were taken to a corner booth and given our menus.  Within a minute or two someone approached us and asked us for our beverage order.  I believe she must have been the server assistant (bus person).  A few min later we received our beverages.  The waiter (sorry, forgot his name) approached our table to see if we had questions and find out if anyone of us were new to Hash House.  We mentioned to him that 2 of us were new to Hash House, and he promptly explained the menu and portion sizes of the food.  We took a few min to order because of our conversation at the table with one another, but ordered within 10 min of being sat.  

I ended up ordering the Lumberjack breakfast which came with 2 eggs and your choice of meat or potatoes and 1 large pancake.  You have the option of upgrading or substituting for a speciality pancake for an additional charge.  Because of the holidays, I choose the pumpkin pancake. On a side note, my friends ordered a ""LARGE"" cheeseburger with fries, a second Lumberjack breakfast, and an omelette.  However, just before our food was delivered, the waiter told me that the chef made the mistake of making a pecan pumpkin pancake on my order instead.  He offered to make me a new one or asked if I was ok with that.  I like them both, so I said the pecan pancake was just fine.  The breakfast was delicious, however, adding the pecans to the pancake fills you up fast.  There were a lot of pecans in it.  Granted, this is not a complaint...it's just a lot of food, so come hungry!!  In addition, the coffee was hot and fresh as it should be, and I especially love the pour spout sugar on the table (instead of sugar packets) because, personally, I like a little coffee with my sugar...if you know what I mean!  

Overall, service was great, server was very prompt with our requested items, coffee and water was always kept full, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.  I will definitely be back to this location or another location based on the food quality alone and their delicious coffee!  Also,If you ever have a craving for the perfect drunk food at 3 am after you leave the club, then this is the place to go!

Only negatives I noticed about the restaurant was the noise level in the room is high and it makes it a little difficult to have a conversation with people at your own table.  The other was the lack of cell signal in the hotel.  I like to post pictures on Instagram and Facebook, but had to do it after I left the hotel.  At one point I even had to leave the table and walk out to Valet just to take an important phone call.  But, that is not the fault of the restaurant...just a really old building!

It's great food and very decently priced. Huge portions, great biscuits!"" I had to listen to this for weeks, so I was relieved when we finally got to go! I thought ""seriously how great can one breakfast place be?"" Well let me tell you.....

We went this last Saturday morning and it was packed. I mean like flies swarming to food packed. Super packed. We were given a 1 hr 15 min wait. We were ok with that. I mean that's a great indication that people love the place right??

We went downstairs to get a few coffees and after 30 mins I asked my husband to check on the wait time. To our surprise, they were ready for us! I never have bloody marys but hubby said this place is known for their bloody marys, so I thought why the heck not! I looked at the menu - man oh man do they have a selection of bloody marys. I had no clue what to get so I kept it simple to the house version. Let me tell you- this was my very first bloody mary and it was brilliant!!! It was soooo good!!! I shared it with my cousin who is an avid bloody mary fan and he said he loved it. They infuse the pickle and olives with something...I can't put my figure on it, but it's darn tasty!!! 

Hubby and I split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It's actually enough food for 3 people!!! It's a complete meal. I took a picture of the description of the benedict so I wouldn't forget what yummy goodness was in there. Eggs, fresh crisp tomato, spinach, fried chicken,  biscuits, huge strips of bacon, touch of hot sauce on the side....I know I'm forgetting something. It was quite literally the most complete meal I've ever had for breakfast. Soooo good!!! Now I'm going to be dreaming about this. It's definitely a once in a while splurge because you can easily rename it to ""the heart attack "" meal.  LoL 

We also had the corn beef hash (which was also enough for 2 people). Best corn beef hash ever!!! The potatoes = delicious!!! We also also had the French toast which was excellent. We like our French toast a bit on the crispy side, so it could have been more crispy.

I drooled over photos on yelp before my trip and bookmarked it.  However, we ended up here in the evening at about 9 pm, so they didn't have their breakfast in full force.

However, I had already eaten 3 donuts that day in addition to a buffet and many many drinks, so I didn't want to go overboard and ended up ordering a chicken breast thing. My bf ordered some kind of corned beef sandwich. 

Food took FOREVER and we were starving. When the food came out, my chicken breasts were on bones (ewwww, I can't handle meat on a bone) so I switched back into gluttony mode and asked if I could order a burger instead. Server was very quick to whisk away the boned food and my burger came out fast. It was a FULL POUND LUCY STUFFED BURGER with mozzarella and red peppers inside.  Sounds amazing, right?! It was just okay. The burger was actually very bland and I had to put a bunch of salt and pepper on it. I got it with a salad to redeem myself a little bit. They also gave me fries too. Fries were okay. Salad was fine. I did manage to eat almost the whole burger. I would have definitely liked to come back for breakfast and plan to if I am ever back.

I honestly do not remember the name of what I ordered but it was an egg white scramble with spinach and fruit.  I was really trying to be my usual, healthy self since I had been indulging for 4 days on booze and shitty food, and this really hit the spot!!

So after having this place hyped up by one of my buddies, I was really excited since i like a good breakfast. And i LOVE a good breakfast after a hard night of drinking..which is where this review will begin! lol

So when we get to Imperial Palace, we find Hash House and it's swarmed by people waiting to get in.  The hostess informs us that it's about an hour wait time to get seated..$10 and 5 minutes later, we were seated haha

I know it was busy and all, but it took absolutely forever to take our orders, bring out drinks, and bring out our food.  So service you can was average at the best. Our waitress was nice when we did see her, but that was rare.

I opted for the world famous sage fried chicken and waffles. the chicken was really good! the batter was light and flavorful. the waffles had huge strips of bacon inside them. however, besides that there was nothing special about them.  batter they used was a little heavy, and the waffle itself was uneventful. 

Pricing is good for the Strip. Most dishes were around $15 and portions were huge and easily shared. 

Maybe I was expecting too much? But this place wasn't all that cracked out. The food was average at best. If I hadn't greased the hostess, this meal would have taken more then 2 hours if you include the wait time.

The bacon was too smokey rather than maple so it detracted a little. But the chicken was super on point which made up for any issues I had with the waffles. The sage and a bit of syrup made an amazing combo with the chicken. With their volume, they really know how to fry up a chicken at just the right temperature.

We came a little early so we beat the breakfast rush. By the time we left, the lobby was packed. While we had no wait, the wait by the time we left was over 30 minutes.",0,0,0

I got the Chicken and Waffles, which was gloriously yummy.  The chicken was fried with sage in the batter, which added a nice element.  The waffles were made with bacon in the middle, for a nice surprise when putting together a chicken\/waffle\/bacon bite.

We also tried one of their stuffed burgers, which was good (not great, this could have been influenced by our experience at Le Burger Brassiere with the $77 burger, see my other review). 

Both portions were huge, I don't know anyone who could finish a portion.  However, I can say that their drinks were wonderful.  They had a great Bloody Mary (nice and spicy) along with some special wine spritzer type drinks that were light and refreshing.

Because I wanna go too.  I love this place.  I love the name, I love the food, and I love the attitude.

The Name:
Okay, surely the name is a double entendre.  Yes, they are famous for the hash mixtures of potatoes and eggs mixed with vegetables and corned beef (or other protein choices).   All delicious, I'm sure.  But what about the other hash?  Why don't they just come out and call it Chronic a go go?  On second thought, maybe that name wouldn't fly.

The Food:
It's described as twisted farm food.  Genius.  Hash House a go go takes heartwarming comfort food and gives it a crazy twist.   Want fried chicken and waffles?  Consider the Sage Fried Chicken stacked with a Bacon Waffle, hot maple caramel reduction sauce and crowned with fried leeks.  Yummy, a bit off kilter from expected and oh so delicious.  And there's plenty more choices where that came from.

The Attitude
The menu, the place, the staff are all a bit funky and quirky.  Love the sassy boldness of the place.",4,3,3

I wanted a place that offered a unique culinary experience and boy did we get it here!!! Service was impeccable; Steve was awesome and delivered great service. The wait was 40 min for our group of  9, but it was so darn worth the wait!!! I literally wanted to order everything on the menu; they're known for their hashes and Benedicts. 

Keep in mind that you aren't going to get the traditional Eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce.  Instead, they create their own special sauce and everything we ordered was delicious! We ordered:

Sage Chicken Benedict: Crispy Sage infused chicken on top of a mountain of carbs (2 grape size biscuits and mash potatoes) smothered in a creamy Chipotle sauce with sauteed spinach. One word: Heavenly. 

Meat Loaf Hash: Meat loaf was tender and well seasoned. Best part, you didn't overdose from the salt because there was barely any! 

Blueberry Pecan Pancakes are as gigantic as a large pizza and was crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. 

Sage Chicken & Bacon Waffles: This meal changed my life. I never understood the hype over Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles or the new Lays Chicken and waffles potatoes chips, but this dish seriously was the best ever!! The sage not only elevated the super juicy and tender chicken, but the fried leeks seriously took the dish to the top level. I wish they had chopped bacon bits throughout the waffle rather than just one strip, but their homemade maple syrup wasn't overly sweet, so the juxtaposition of sweet and salty was like an explosion in your mouth.

Yes, indeed, they ARE huge! I loved the crispiness of the fried chicken, and the hollandaise sauce had just the right amount of savoriness to each bite. The mashed potato was also pretty good.

Hash House A Go Go is famous for their massive portions and delicious sage chicken and waffles.

Just a skip and a hop from the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, Hash House is located in the Quad within the Linq Promenade.  Unfortunately, we went at prime brunch hour (10:30 AM), so the wait was about 45 minutes.  Not to worry, this is Vegas!  We ended up just ""waiting"" at the bar downstairs...

Once seated, we didn't even have to look at the menu to know what we wanted: mimosas and sage chicken & waffles, please!

The mimosas were weak and overpriced, but kept our morning fun going.  And the chicken and waffles still haunt me in my dreams!  Waffles crispy on the outside, soft and light on the inside, topped with a mountain of sauteed onions and crispy fried chicken, juicy in each bite, and slathered with gooey delicious maple syrup.  And the portions?  HUGE.  My friend and I split a plate, had leftovers, and were still beyond stuffed!

Everytime we tried getting his attention he would purposely ignore us and when we made sure we got his attention his was rude .. Made smirky comments never said you're welcome when we said thank you.. And when we would ask for some items he would just go get whatever he had to get without saying anything you could tell he was pissed off honestly if it wasn't for him this would have been 5 stars but he totally killed my vibe,1,0,0

we got there and got seated right away place wasn't to full yet, I ordered some kind of spritzer cocktail, it was tasty, my friend ordered some kinda Mojito champagne thing, she didn't like it but I did, because im a lush.
I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles which comes with,
two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks.

This thing was huge as you can see from the pic, I thought the bacon cooked into the waffle was G, the leeks where all over it, and there was a little bit of diced Bellperes around the whole plate, the presentation was on point. I was surprised how much the flavors all balanced out together, I thought the leeks, & bell pepper would throw it off, but every bit of it all magically went together. My friend Lanz had one of the house hashes the Chorizo, jalapenos, cheddar cheese & fresh tomato.
This comes with tossed  crispy potatoes and is topped w\/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit. 
T
his was really really good, and i thought it was gonna be super meh, no way this tasted better than most Mexican spots in LA that serve Chorizo breakfast style, with that said my friend was too out of it to eat it all, so I took the pleasures.

The hostesses were very impersonable and really had an air about them as if we were bothering them by wanting to be seat.  Luckily, our waiter made up for the rude hostesses.  He was attentive and on point with the drink refills; Always appreciated when the Vegas weather is 115 degress outside.

So, it's located on the 2nd floor at the Imperial Palace. Trying to find the hostess stand in this clusterf*ck of people is ridiculous. The stand need to be moved to the entrance to the restaurant, not set back halfway into the lobby. 

The server was nice, but perhaps a little overwhelmed. The one thing that I noticed here is that the servers didn't really help out any table but their own. Not much teamwork. For example, I sat with an empty glass of iced tea while the waitress at the next station filled empty glasses for her customers and walked right past our table with a half-full pitcher of tea. Nice. 

I ordered the blue cheese burger which was okay. The meat was dry and not juicy as I had hoped. It was massive, that's for sure and they brush the top of the bun with butter or oil, which makes it really slippery and hard to handle. My bf had the tractor combo with a blackberry granola pancake. He said that it was average.

I knew I would miss my hollandaise sauce but the roasted cream sauce sounded interesting. The service was great and the food comes out super fast. It was huge to my surprise. It was pretty bland to me and what makes it huge is the super enormous scoops of mashed potatoes and two fluffy biscuits. It's a total carbohydrate nightmare. I ate the sauce and the eggs and a few bites of potato with biscuit. But I still craved my traditional benedict that I originally had my heart set on. I should have ordered a scramble instead because there is a lack of protein in this dish.

Judging by the two men seated next to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).

We both ordered up Bloody Mary's- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn't taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fiancé opted to ""man"" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.

We decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. 

Overall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. 

I probably won't be back unless I'm with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I'd probably just order a bloody marry.

The wait for this place when we went (with a large group) was one hour. Do I complain... not a bit. great excuse to play a table game and get my dink on downstairs  in the casino. Once our friend got the call that the table was ready that's when the excitement set in. I look in the menu and duh I order the chicken Benedict thing! That dish came out and I started feeling full! The portions were soooooo large! Like seriously a family of four could have at this dish. I finished what I could and I must say that it was very delish!!!! Everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned and that chipotle cream sauce changed my life!!!

The prices (considering the portions) were very good. The over all cleanliness of the restaurant was very good! that place gets a lot of business moving in and out so im sure its easy to keep a place like that spotless, but they do a very good job.

I saw lots of Mimosas and Bloody Mary's going out, but I stuck with coffee and an order of corned beef hash and eggs.

I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she said that she wanted to go to Las Vegas. (16 year old birthday presents sure have changed since I turned 16.  My parents gave me a card and said that if I wanted to drive, I would have to buy my own car.  End of story.)  Fast forward to today and off we go to Vegas.  

Muff has been watching various food shows, like forever, and decided that she wanted to go Hash House A-Go-Go for one of her gifts.  With Muff, my sister, sister-in-law and nieces in tow, we set off to procure a table.   To say that everyone in Vegas attempted to do the same thing at the same time is an understatement.  However, the food gods must have been smiling down upon us because we got a table within 10 minutes of getting there. (Apparently, it helped that we had a large party.)

So what goes best with poor judgment? Heaping portions of rich fattening food and oversized adult beverages with bright colors to keep you awake.

Most of the waitstaff I've encountered here doesn't annoy me because they can read the room. Sometimes the party is over and quiet voices accompanied by dim lights is preferable while we're kicking off our heels and ready to order whatever will soak up the alcohol. 

Honestly the sweet drinks always look pretty but anything with ""Electric"" in the title doesn't appeal to me after like, rum and more rum or bourbon, etc. Their Bloody Marys complete with a snack go really well with the scrambles which I totally recommend. Biscuits and gravy and the benedicts rate just ok because they're too dense for me at times. Lesson learned. Also blessed be the cooks and their ability to make bacon that's always crispy.    

If I'm done drinking then the chicken and waffles is so so so good. Sweet and salty is the bestest. If you don't want coffee they'll make you a chocolate milk which is perfect before passing out. Sadly they have Pepsi products so that's out, but I forgive them. 

I haven't tried the meatloaf and I can never talk anyone else into ordering it. *sigh*

Service is consistently pretty good considering the customer base they have to tolerate at times. Special thanks to the waiter who saved my life by chasing me down to return the lashes I peeled off and left at the table last time. Sometimes I'm too tired to keep it classy ;)",15,12,11

Then why the 1 star review? The attitude of the manager. 

We, party of 4, got there at 9:55, seated at 10:05 (which we thought was amazing), and got served almost cold food at 10:55. Really?

We started noticing the time after seeing a few tables that were seated after us, got their food first.
When we finally got ours, the potato fries were luke warm, the eggs were wrongly cooked and the ham was card board like.
We told the waiter, John, and he attempted to fix the wrong. We can live with that.

But then we asked for the manager and he came in with the ""Yeah, so what, I don't give a sh*t"" attitude. He was non apologetic and cold shouldered. Most definitely not a good trait for a manager.

When you're out if town, and you just want a good meal and was not served one, a manager should at least smile when he's acknowledging a bad service\/food.

SERVICE: The first time around, service was awesome. Our server brought everything to us in a timely manner. However, the second time around, at 3AM, service was dead. What made me laugh was the fact that as the server was filling our glass cups and ran out of water, she nonchalantly said ""oh ran out"" and never came back to fill up my water cup. I was so thirsty from the disgusting corned beef hash and dry biscuit. 

FOOD: For breakfast, the food was awesome. I had the gravy biscuit mashed potatoes thingy (idr the name) and it was savory and delicious. My girlfriend ordered the flapjack not knowing that it was the size of Yao Ming. The second time, I had the corned beef hash which was my biggest ragret.

The husband got the famous fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was fine. The waffles were not. Heavy, doughy, flabby and lukewarm: these were very sad waffles indeed. Come to think of it, they were pretty much the opposite of a waffle in every respect. 

I was wary of the waffles to begin with and ordered the corned beef hash instead. The scrambled eggs that came with the dish were well prepared. The hash felt....um....assembled. I'm betting the dish was made by putting down a layer of fried potatoes in a skillet, throwing on some onions, peppers, and shredded corned beef, then piling on some swiss cheese and running the whole thing under a broiler. In no way were the ingredients sautéed together, which is what makes a hash a hash. This was just a pile.

- Andy's Sage Fried Chicken - served with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit - delicious mash potatoes, the yolk from egg made the dish more rich, chicken was fried to perfection and the biscuits was buttery, try to get a little bit of everything in one bite!

Being from Indianapolis it was quite interesting to see this ""Twisted Farm Food"", which was every bit of delicious. Granted, we don't really eat like neanderthals in Indy it was perfect. 

My fiance and I both enjoyed the Kiwi Watermelon lemonades - beautifully made with an even better taste. 

Him: My hubby got the rosemary chicken skillet (something like that) which was an absolutely delectable serving of roasted chicken, fried potatoes, egg and turkey bacon. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with flavorful rosemary and paired with perfectly cooked potatoes, being served in a sizzling hot skilled. My hubby is a cop-out and got scrambled eggs (so you can't really mess that up). 

Me: I had a ""Tractor Platter"" with french toast which was perfectly seasoned with egg and cinnamon, and topped with powdered sugar (yum!). The best thing, the french toast wasn't some tiny piece of bread but real Texas toast - this was in turn served with delicious crispy shredded hash browns (cooked to perfection), which for some reason no other restaurant can seem to get hash brown crispy. Kudos to Hash House A Go Go on that. The final part of my dish was fantastic - a serving of fresh fruit, a banana sliced long, and a couple slices of orange. The banana was a great surprise because, they actually threw it on the grill, which was a taste of perfection. It enhanced the sweetness of the banana without completely caramelizing it. (It was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn't stop munching on it)

Come early to avoid the lines. Great chicken and waffles. Best chicken pot pie ever made. Comfort breakfast at relatively cheap pricing. 

This place shocked me. It is truly a must visit restaurant in Las Vegas.  It's out of this world amazing for brunch. And has the best value I have ever had on the strip. I will make it a place to eat every single time I'm in Vegas.  The lines are long and worth the wait.  Trust me.

Located deep inside the linq.  This place is busy. Every time I went it was about a one hour wait on the weekend. Despite this. The staff are super organized and it is pretty efficient.  Food is made to order and comes out a bit slow. But it's worth every minute you wait. Bc once you get your meal it's a feast of home cooked comfort food overload. The dishes are not just supersized. They are family sized. Honestly each dish can easily feed a family of four.

Be prepared to stuff yourself silly and still have leftovers. It's Las Vegas indulgence at its finest. 

I loved every dish I have eaten here. The chicken and waffles is a feast. The chicken pot pie was deliciously filled with plenty of vegetables and chicken. The eggs Benedict was truly satisfying. Everything huge, fresh and unbelievably tasty. It's definetly not a place to go if you're on a diet or watching what you eat. The dishes are loaded with butter and everything tasty.

This location is located in one of the classiest casino and hotels on the Las Vegas strip, the Imperial Palace.  It's Asian motif along with the celebrity impersonators makes it a grade A destination in the 702. It's located upstairs and I heard it's pretty new to the casino.  Definitely looks new.

My friends and I waited about 45 minutes to get a table.  I spent the time wisely, winning 60 bucks at the blackjack table.  The place is pretty crowded as they accommodate big parties.  The restaurant is really big as I saw tables and tables of people.

The wait for the food took a while, I'd probably say like 25-30 minutes.  For some reason, I fell in and out of hungriness so by the time I got my food, I wasn't as hungry as I was an hour ago. That was really a shame because the portions were pretty damn huge.  When I looked at my friends' faces, they looked as if it was more of a task than a great meal.  

I ended  up ordering the Fried Chicken Benedict, which was featured on Man V Food I believe.  It wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  The damn thing was HUGE but there was so much going on with that thing that the flavor's just mashed up and it was like I was eating slop.  Fried Chicken and bacon are two of my favorite things but when they are combined, it's just too rich for me.  There was just too many diff flavors combined into one.  

I don't recall any of my friends saying their food was great but maybe everyone was full.  I saved half of the food for later and ate it after a night of drinking. For some reason, that shit still wasn't super appetizing.  Those fries Ray gave me were better tasting!

Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  If you like big portions, holler at this place.  Honestly, I don't think the wait was worth it but possibly go on a weekday or something and I'm sure the lines will be shorter.",1,2,1

By the time our table was ready the lobby was filling up. Definitely get there early if you don't want to wait long!

The menu has a wide range of items. I got one of the farm scrambles (bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss). It came with a biscuit and potatoes. More than enough food. In fact, the portions here are insanely huge. One of my reasons for giving them four stars instead of five is because there is no need for portion sizes to be this large. It's pretty, and impressive, but ultimately it's just a waster of food. Most people leave a good amount behind.

The other reason for giving them four stars is that the potatoes were not that great. They were not terrible but not worth any room in my stomach. I focused on my biscuit (excellent!) and scramble.

My brother had the chicken and waffles. It was insane! Two pieces of fried chicken and four or more waffles. The waffles had strips of bacon inside them. We thought the added bacon in the waffles was fun, but again, an unnecessary amount of food that went to waste. Cut the chicken and waffles down to half the size and probably most people still couldn't eat it all.

Our server was fantastic - some of the best service we had in all of Vegas (shout out to Billy). The host was not super friendly and barely made eye contact, but he was efficient.

My mother had to send back her eggs because they were cold, rubbery, and very overcooked. Personally my breakfast was decent, but not better than something I could get at a Denny's.

This palace is also EXTREMELY loud. You will have to yell at the top of your lungs to be heard by someone sitting directly next to you.

Nice environment, everyone there seemed really friendly and helpful

Down's
They told us 45 minute wait which turned into a two hour wait.  Luckily we were at a casino and had ample time to lose our money,

The bloody mary which i was super excited for was a little more bells and whistles and lacked some quality.  It looked amazing with its bacon and slice of toast, however upon drinking it there was nothing that made it special beyond the decor of the glass.",0,0,0

Hostess asked us to wait 20 minutes and exactly 20 minutes later, our table was ready (not bad for a Sunday morning). Music was a tad too loud for me for a restaurant but nothing too major.

Husband ordered the basic breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes). I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast. Both servings were HUGE! The value is unbeatable... great food, big portions, for a decent price. Both of us loved the food. It was warm, tasty, and cooked perfectly. We didn't wait too long for the food, which surprised me considering how packed it was. We both had orange juice and it was freshly squeezed and refreshing. Wait service was good as well.

My only other suggestion is to get the cheese mash potatoes side. AMAZING! And for whatever reason leftover meatloaf tastes amazing the next day.

Therefore, on our most recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stop by for some late night eats. Perhaps, it was partly due to the anticipation of trying the sage fried chicken after several unsuccessful attempts, but we were a bit disappointed. We tried the sage fried chicken with bacon waffle tower and crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin Benedict. We ended up preferring the pork tenderloin, but honestly, even on this dish, the griddled mashed potatoes was the best thing on there.

As for the sage fried chicken with bacon waffle, the presentation looked nice, but the taste just wasn't there. The fried chicken crust was lacking in flavor and just tasted too much like uncooked flour. The chicken was also dry which made things worse. The bacon inside the waffle was more of a novelty. The idea is interesting, but I feel that bacon flavored maple syrup would have done the same trick. The waffle portion wasn't bad, and this was the best part of the dish.

The crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin is essentially wiener schnitzel (battered and fried pork cutlet). The gravy that was served was very tasty and had a surprising hint of sweetness that made the gravy irresistible. Because they didn't provide much gravy, we asked for more gravy, which they charged us additional. We ordered the Farm Benedict version of the crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin which came with tomatoes, spinach and scrambled eggs instead of the typical poached egg that you get with a Benedict. The whole contraption sat upon a huge bed of griddled mashed potatoes which was the best thing of the meal. Unlike the typical smooth mashed potatoes, these griddled mashed potatoes were more like smashed breakfast potatoes where there was still substance to the potatoes, with some browning picked up by the griddling process. The potatoes were seasoned very well and the griddling really helped to make this the best part of the meal. Combining the gravy with the potatoes made them even better. 

All in all, you will get huge portions of food here. While the presentation might look fancier than your typical diner, the quality of the food is about the same as a typical diner. Most disappointing is the sage fried chicken which is definitely not the best fried chicken you've ever had, being both dry and saddled with a lackluster crust.",1,0,0

2 adults & kid

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Picked this based on the reviews I read about the one in Reno.  I assumed it was in Harrah's in Vegas too.  But I was wrong.  I got redirected after asking security at Harrah's.  Then I walked past the escalator without realizing the restaurant was on the second floor in a special section.  None of their ""floor - traffic"" boards even mention Hash House.

Atmosphere - Trendy place but the tables are too tall or the chairs are too short.  Too trendy for my taste, I just found it difficult for me at 5' 11"", my daughter had at least a pillow to help her out.  

Food
Appetizer - We had the dinner menu but did not see anything listed that looked like an app.

Main Course - We ordered the Duck to split between the two of us.  The waiter warned us the sizes were very large.  He was not kidding.  The duck was very good.  But the mashed yams\/potatoes stole the meal.  Oh my they were so good.  I can not even describe it.  I do not know if it was the wrapped meat around it or just the mixing of yams with it, but it made the meal!  They also finished the plate with whole carrots and green beans on the sides.

Dessert - This thing was large enough for one person as a meal.  We ordered the bread pudding made with snickers.  It took 20 minutes after we placed the order so you know they just made it for us, awesome!  The amount of vanilla ice cream on top of the black gooey mess was more than I would put in a bowl for myself.  $8 for this gooey heaven was well worth the wait.  If they have this in Reno I could see going their just for that alone.  It is worth every calorie.  By the way the three of us probably only ate a third of it after the huge dinner.

Service - I have to say I was very disappointed here.  Best way to put the host station was seriously lacking.  Sure a large party was in front of us.  But after the one and only hosted figured out how many people there was he disappeared for a while with no word to us.  And what was strange was the restaurant was not overly full, maybe 50% occupancy.   Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  He promptly told us about the $2.50 split plate charge for our dinner.  But before dinner was served he brought me my extra plate.  The plate was not clean, but you could tell it went thru the dishwasher.  His response to the dirty plate is ""I just grab and go"" which makes sense since the pile plates should be perfect for service.  With dessert the food was delivered by a food runner.  He realized we did not have silverware and he went to grab some.  I could see him searching and picking out clean ones from the tray of spoons.  So that make question how clean the ones we did not get.  I think they have a dishwasher issue.",0,0,0

I wasn't in the mood for a burger but opted for the Baby Burger thinking it was a more appropriate amount of food. That wasn't the case. It was also served dry. I wanted to order the same breakfast potatoes with my burger that my friend ordered with her meal but was told I couldn't. I settled for bacon & cheese mashed potatoes instead. We wanted bloody beers but were told we couldn't get those either. Strange because they serve both beer and Bloody Mary's. Our server came off as friendly but then seemed somewhat annoyed and put out when I asked her questions. Also strange since she said we were her first customers of the day. Overall, I might go back. But only if I was sharing a meal with at least 1 more person because the meal sizes were just too enormous. A fresh baked biscuit with butter & their fresh strawberry jam with a cup of coffee would've been a better choice.",1,0,0

I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. 

I arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), ""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there."" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. 

First of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. 

Second, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. 

Third, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. 

Fourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she ""LOST"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! 

I give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...

So Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",1,0,0

That said, we paid decently on the cocktails, and I didn't really like my electric blue sports drink cocktail (forgot the name). I think out of my friends, we only got 1 drink we liked.

Came here at 7:30 the morning of the first games of the NCAA tournament, and there was already a 30 minute wait. A little snooping and we grabbed three seats at the bar. 

The Bloody Mary's here are top notch; tons of spice and pickled vegetables, including an olive stuffed with a jalapeño that cleared my sinuses for sure. A friend also had their unique take on a screwdriver made from tangerine juice and honey vodka. If you like a screwdriver, you must give this a go instead. Amazing mix of flavors in a totally unexpected way. 

I opted for the sage fried chicken, which came with scrambled eggs, about two pounds of mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. I'm not kidding when I say this was probably 4 pounds of food. The fried chicken is the obvious star of the dish, and was crispy and pretty sure had some cornflakes in there, topped with a savory syrup sauce. 

This is one of the true value meals on the strip, with the food coming in around $14ish for more food than a human should reasonable eat in a single sitting. Expect a wait here, and don't worry, the food and drink make it more than worthwhile. You don't want to miss out on this one.",3,0,1

Upon getting seated, we had already decided on splitting 2 dishes since the portions were huge. We ordered the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Salmon Hash House. After seeing a table with a order of waffles, we felt like it was necessary to go all out and overindulge by ordering the granola waffles.

Can I just say this place was beyond good? Perfect food to soak up a hangover...or compliment your already drunk self. I decided to ignore my vegetarian ways and stuff my face with all kinds of meat. My girls and I definitely inhaled all the food.

The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken definitely lived up to the hype. It came topped on split, fresh biscuits with tomato, mozzarella, spinach, chipotle cream, spinach...(so many things on it!). The chipotle cream was delicious with it and the whole entree came with savory mashed potatoes. 

 The Salmon Hash came with scrambled eggs, fresh biscuit, and house potatoes. The salmon was a bit dry, but nothing a little Tabasco and ketchup couldn't fix. Then we topped our meal off with finishing up the granola waffle. The waffles were so moist and tasted amazing. Who would've though about granola waffles? Loved it! If you're a waffle fan, or even if you aren't, you must order the waffles. I'm not even big on waffles, but loved it and would highly recommend ordering it!

After seated the waiter did let us know that it would be another 45 minutes after taking our orders until we received our food. That was probably the only issue I had with this place. I was starving but I think I can definitely say the food I devoured made the wait worthwhile. 

Firstly, I'd like to start off saying that their prices may seem very high at a first glance on the menu but after seeing the GIGANTIC food portions I found the prices to be decent. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (this also appeared on an episode of Man Vs. Food) and let me just say it is simply AMAZING. I don't think I've ever had something quite like it. It comes with fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, chipotle cream, scrambled eggs, and delicious fried chicken. This plate is meant to be shared but if you're a fatty like me, I didn't share and was happy to take home left overs for my late night muchies hehe. Each bite I would try to get a little piece of everything into my fork to make the perfect bite each time. SO WORTH. I think the chipotle cream really seals the deal and puts everything together. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection as well. Overall, i was very happy with my food and I think my food belly afterwards proves it. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.",1,0,0

The wait can be long....actually it's always long. Expect at least a minimum of 35 minutes for a small group. 

Once you're seated, service here is quite prompt. The staff here are pretty equipped in getting your order and meals delivered quickly without making you feel like you have to gulp down your meal. 

I ordered the hash with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts and egg whites.....as healthy as I can make it! Chris ordered the ""healthy start"" with a side of chicken sausage. Our friend ordered the BBBLT sandwich and another friend ordered the sage chicken. We all agreed to ordering a side of the brown sugar banana flapjack and an iced banana latte. 

Of course our eyes pretty much fell out of our socket when each of our meal arrived. We didn't know how to manage the portion, but we all took one bite at a time. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The BBBLT was met with a lot of satisfaction along with their famous sage chicken. You know it's good when all you see are smiles and thumbs up from everyone. Matter of fact, it was so good that we all agreed to come back again the next day!! I enjoyed heir biscuit. It was dense on the outside and the inside was soft and pillowy. The strawberry jam added another level of ""OMG"" to their food. The latte was one of my favorite drink which surprised me. The brown sugar flapjack was too good!! The Carmelites brown sugar and the banana was a match made in flapjack heaven. We all finished it but I think Chris and I ate a majority of it. But there is no regret! 

The next day, Chris and I returned and ordered the same thing except we ordered the snickers flapjack and a mint choco latte. The latte was okay. I prefer the banana latte over this one and the snickers was good but by far, our favorite was still the brown sugar flapjack.

The server had to be reminded several times for something, like cream for our coffee, extra garnishes for our drinks, extra sides we ordered, etc... even though we reminded him several times for lemons, he kept forgetting which got irritating. It came to a point where we had to approach another server for lemons. 

Now the chicken and waffles that everyone has been hyping about.  The chicken skin was delicious and crunchy.  The chicken itself was super dry.  The waffles were very surprising with the bacon inside of it.  Waffles were also dry.  There was a little side of syrup, but I felt like the syrup was needed to drench the chicken and waffles to give them the moisture that it was lacking.

The main reason to come here would be if you are hungry, don't feel like paying for a buffet, and want a comfort food experience. The price works out to be about the same as you would pay at Wicked Spoon or other breakfast\/lunch buffet. Keep that in mind as you read the rest of this review. 

Food Quality:
It's definitely ""comfort food,"" they do not mislead you there. But is it high quality? No. Taste? Flavorful. Sure, the sage fried chicken and waffles was more flavorful than your average chicken. I'll give them innovation points there. Also, the chicken pot pie crust + cream sauce filling was well-seasoned, using thyme and rosemary to add some unique flavor. 

Food Quantity: 
Huge portions. Come hungry. But the food is rich, so it's hard to put down a whole large skillet full, especially if you plan to be a functioning Vegas-goer the rest of the day. 

Service:
Terrible service. The wait is long to get into the restaurant. Every time I have been here they manage to skip my name, claiming they ""called me twice."" Our waitress this last time literally talked my boyfriend out of ordering what he wanted and made him feel super awkward. 

Ambiance:
Nightmarish. Very loud. Seating arrangement is to cram as many people in as possible, so you're literally facing people and their plates. It's hard not to stare at what your neighbor ordered because the portions are huge. 

Price:
Ok, so you're getting a LOT of food. But does that justify the $17.99 price tag? I think that's the question I am struggling with. 

So, it really comes down this: Does the flavor and comforting gimmick of the food outweigh the long wait and hefty bill? Questionable. I'm really torn about whether I will be back, but I know that there are much better places to eat in Vegas.",0,0,0

JH & BB both ordered the fried chicken with bacon waffles with a side of biscuits & gravy and eggs over easy.  As for me I decided to go with the HH Original Eggs Benedict wanting something more traditional for breakfast.  However, I have to say there was nothing traditional about my dish.  

The portion sizes here are ridiculous, meant for severely overweight, gluttonous people, potheads and body builders.  I was only able to have half of my plate and even then I started to suffer from food coma.  Taste wise it was a-ok, it didn't really blow my mind, I think the wow-factor for this place is the portion size more than the flavor if anything.  Everything seemed a little lacking in flavor to me, maybe it was because I woke up drunk from the night before?

We ordered two Sage Chicken and Waffles, 2 coffees and 1 orange juice. To start I normally throw down with the best of them, but I couldn't even finish this meal. Everything was phenomenal honestly. If we return to Vegas we might stay at Linq just to enjoy Hash House every other day!

So back to this wicked meal! The coffee was nice and strong! The OJ was freshly juiced and of course saved the best for last....
Sage Chicken and Waffles:
- presentation was stellar!
- portion was huge!
- waffles also had bits of bacon! Yes folks the waffles had chunks of bacon slices! Heavenly surprise.
- chicken was juicy and crispy. Best of both worlds! 
- chicken had a hint of sage that was very faint, so not herby overpowering!! Loved it!
- chicken was mainly a breast and had a tiny drumstick stick attached. Almost like a leg quarter, but not a leg quarter.

If in Vegas make this place a must visit folks. The food is to die for. As stated earlier, if we return to Vegas - the hash house will be on heavy rotation Holla! Enjoy folks!",6,6,9

I have nothing spectacular to report about the service but I'm appreciative to the wait staff that allowed my crazy Italian family and I plenty of time to catch up (thanks!). 

The food. WOW! Talk about HUGE portions! I ordered the chicken salad ""sandwich"" with mac and cheese as my side. I must say, the mac and cheese was some of the best fatty food I've had in a while! The chicken salad was dwarfed by the extremely large pieces of Texas toast it was jammed in between. 

All in all, my family enjoyed their selections and I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese portion of my meal.

A native Hoosier, the pork tenderloin sandwich tends to be elusive outside of Indiana so when I find one the rest of the menu becomes irrelevant. Clara (""show me the beef"" fame) would be excited to see that the meat significantly dwarfs the bun. In fact it is the sized of a normal dinner plate. On top of that was the side dish of mashed potatoes covered in strips of bacon and smothered in cheese -- had to have been at least a pound. I hear their breakfast is equally as good. I took three college athletes who all amazingly scarfed down their meals with no problem. Another bonus was the price.

Location: Hash House A Go Go is located at the Linq hotel off the strip. The restaurant is on the second floor above the casino. If you cant find it, just ask one of the many helpful employees at the casino. They will be happy to assist you. Once you do find the restaurant, be prepared to wait. The minimum wait is ball park 45 minutes to an hour. You can put your name down and gamble if you like but make sure your entire party is there when they call your name. 7\/10

Food: The portions are epic here. Their Corn Beef Hash is delicious. The corned beef is served with potatoes and onions, two eggs, a biscuit the size of a softball, and a bowl of fruit. I like my eggs over easy and I break the yolk over everything. I've also ordered the Chicken and Waffles here and it was pretty good. The plate is literally a tower of food. A bed of sweet, crunchy Texas sized waffles. Two crispy fried chicken breasts stacked on top of one another w\/ a knife driving through it all. I like my syrup on the side and dip as I go. Each dish was decently priced around $15. I wish I had pictures of these plates but go see for yourself.  7\/10

Service: Every time I've eaten here was during brunch w\/ a slight hangover. It's busiest around this time but the staff do a really good job checking on your table. Food came out around 20-25 minutes. 7\/10

Was really looking forward to trying this place on our last day. I thought our party of 5 would have to wait forever on Sunday at noon, but surprisingly, we were seated in less than 15 minutes. First off, it was like a sauna at the ""Quad"" and upstairs at Hash House a Go Go. Not a good experience to start off with, and the hostess was a bit rude, saying EVERYONE must be present to be seated. Understood.

We were seated in a cozy booth towards the back, and luckily, it wasn't as hot back there. Our waiter took our drink orders, and 2 of us ordered their famous kiwi watermelon lemonade. One ordered a coffee, and he brought a total of 2 waters for 5 of us, even though others wanted water. The fruity lemonade was refreshing and not overly sweet. They serve it with boba straws!

My friend and I decided to share the famous fried chicken benedict. As a benny fan, I was really excited to try this Man Vs. Food staple. Another ordered the salmon benedict, a salmon hash, and the fried chicken and waffles.

Food came out pretty quickly, and the portions are HUMONGOUS! I was so glad someone agreed to share with me. Overall, the dish was okay, nothing out of this world. The best part was the biscuit.

Friend's smoked salmon benedict was actually cooked, some overly cooked and dry. When she mentioned to the waiter that it wasn't smoked salmon as it said, he got really defensive and said it is smoked, but when they cook it as a benedict, it cooks that way. Friends hash had very badly burnt potatoes, and he agreed that the biscuit was the best part.

Felt bad for the friend that got the fried chicken and waffles. He said the chicken had no flavor and very dry. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the middle, but I think it would be tastier if they crumbled the bacon and put in the batter.

But the portion definitely has decreased since last year. 

The most disappointing part is the egg benedict. It used to be one of my all time favorite, perfect flavoring, great portion size, and awesome juicy chicken. However, this time the mash potato was unevenly seasoned and the egg was scrambled instead of poached. Those are tolerable.

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, each of the three of us was supposed to pick a restaurant to for sure visit. My sweetie's choice was this one. I am not a huge fan of breakfast places, but he loves them.

I was pleasantly surprised! The menu was actually a bit more interesting than the standard bacon, grease, eggs, grease, pancakes, grease . . . and grease, which is a snapshot of what breakfast venues typically offer.

I took a chance on the Tractor Driver Combo with Griddled French toast, which is basically a thick french toast with pecans and banana, and some sort of cinnamon cream sauce. Can you say delectable? Since it was a combo, it also came with bacon and eggs. 

Initially, I was put off by the prices, but once the food came, the cost was justifiable. Two people could share a plate, easily. L'il skinny women who don't eat like me and my midwest-farm-girl sisters might even be able to share it between three people. My beefy man and typically ravenous teen did not come close to finishing; I think I did better than both of them.

My knee-jerk reaction was to give this place a 4, but since I am not impressed by breakfast joints and this one was impressive, I'll compare apples to apples (pancakes to pancakes?) and give it a solid 5.

So, yeah . . . I guess leaving Indiana and still finding a bit of Indiana way over there wasn't such a bad thing after all.

We started with a vanilla waffle to share, which was perfect. Crisp on the outside, & just a hint of vanilla flavoring on the fluffy inside. I got the benedict which was eggs over a biscuit with a red pepper sauce (instead of hollandaise), and a side of mashed red grilled potatoes.

Ordered the BBBLT and it was average at best. Was honestly expecting way more bacon, hence the name. Guess sticking to breakfast food here is probably key, although my friend's burger did look really good (and big of course).

Fried chicken breast atop mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. Stuffed with spinach and bacon, smothered in hollandaise sauce. Just what the dr ordered....or so I thought. 

The dish was fine, just nothing too memorable. With a 'as shown on man v food' tag on the menu, you'd expect delicious. I shoulda realized it meant, 'too much food for any person to ever eat in one sitting'.

You have go through the hotel take the escalators to get to the top and bam your there. Now I want to gripe a little bit about the arrangement of taking in guests. The first thing you see is a line to your left at a counter, thats where you put your name down right? WRONG thats where you can order a drink. 

I was so disappointed that I waited about an additional ten minutes than I needed to in a line I did not need to wait in. I saw a line that was getting larger at the counter I assumed this is where you put your name down but it wasn't it was just to order drinks if you wanted any during the wait. You have to pass up this counter to go to the front of the restaurant to put your name down. By the time I figured this out there were already about maybe ten or twenty names ahead of me so I had to wait a little bit longer. FIX THIS GUYS this was very frustrating for me and a few luckily for some guests I saved them by pointing them to the front, thank God I was there. 

Alright after about a twenty five minute wait I got myself a bloody mary just before getting called. The bloody Mary was beautiful with its  green olives and pickled chili and man oh man does it have a lot of pepper, you can almost not tolerate it at first but after yo suck down all the pepper that settled at the bottom, the drink gets easier to finish. 

Me and the wife got a booth and I have to say the industrial look was eeh dont really know how that connects to any theme but ok. There is like metal platform plates bolted everywhere and the tables are also covered in sheets of aluminum, very cold to rest your elbows on but ok lets get to the food. Me and my wife shared a chicken and waffles breakfast, trust me everything in this place is share-able because of the HUGE amount of food they heep onto your plate. 

The service was pretty good although because it was so busy here it was kind of hard to get the attention of our waiter. He eventually would come by and got us whatever we needed but you can't blame the guy the restaurant was at maximum capacity, I know he was trying to keep up as best as he could. 

When the chicken and waffles showed up it was a tower of fried chicken on top of bacon loaded waffles. It looked good but it didn't taste as good as it looked, the chicken and the waffles taste as if it was frozen bought and reheated. The only reason why anyone would forgive the taste is because you get so much food, seriously. My wife said it was good and then I asked her ok lets take away most of the food and give you one piece of chicken and one waffle would you still be happy and she said no and I asked why and she said because its not enough it doesnt taste that good that it can be on its own, and I said ah ha! see told you its really not that good. 

We also ordered extra biscuits with gravy which was also ok but it was gigantic enough to satisfy our questions for taste. Its really hard to say bad things about a restaurants in vegas because to be honest you have limited amount of choices, especially for breakfast. Would I come here again? well I dont know we'll see. The prices where not that bad to be honest. The only thing redeemable here was the bloody mary which again was just ok.

ps: also forgot to mention if you need to go to the restroom you need to go back downstairs to the hotels restrooms. They do not have any restrooms inside the restaurant, really sucks when you just need to wash your hands.",3,2,2

The hash was loaded with green papers and onions, and served on top of a pile of home fries. There was very little flavor to speak of. The meet was meaty, but sparse on seasonings. All of the flavor was cooked out of the veggies, which were soggy and tasteless. Another day, another location may be worth a try.

The chicken & waffles are a popular one. The waffles are firm and good with the maple syrup. The chicken skin is thick and crunchy. The chicken isn't the most moist but still very good. 

The hash with mushrooms, artichokes, and spinach is so flavorful. We got the eggs scrambled to share and opt for gravy to compliment the huge biscuit.

So far, I haven't experienced that here. 

Sure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. 

I wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. 

Does that make sense? 

How is that even possible?

They give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?

Well....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. 

My precious....

I also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips.

At the time my best friend and I shared the Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w\/ pecan maple syrup. Trust me when I say that was more than enough for the two of us. This time I decided I would attempt to conquer any meal all on my own. 

I was a little indecisive between the Corned Beef with red onions and swiss cheese or The Big O Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower (one of the most popular menu items) but the waiter was very helpful and suggested the Corned Beef. He was definitely right on that one too!

The day before we stopped by to see if we could get a quick bite to eat but after seeing all the people waiting outside we immediate changed our minds and turned around. This time we were a little more smart with our time and we showed up at 6am (hoping it would be off peak hours). I think that was the best decision because by the time we got our food more than half the room was filled. * Keep in mind this place is open 24\/7 *

As the waiters pass by you, you're just in ahhhh with how much food is being dropped off on people's tables. One gentleman was asked to take a picture of these two guys and their breakfast plates. When he finished taking several pictures he said ""Good Luck"" because he knew that there was no way these guys were going to devour that in one sitting.

When our food arrived we immediately brought out our phones for pictures! There was no way we could even start eating these massive plates without documentation as proof that we at least attempted to eat these gigantic meals. The first plate that was dropped off in front of us was Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast w\/maple reduction, with two eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes and biscuits. The food is stacked so high up that a knife is placed vertically through the biscuit and chicken as a skewer to hold everything in place.  It's a sight to see! The Corned Beef arrived next. It was presented on a skillet that had melted cheese all over the shredded beef. Ahhhhh! And the eggs were cooked perfectly sunny side up so when you cut through and broke the yolks, it oozed all over the potatoes. Although it wasn't as impressive as the Fried chicken breast and biscuits it definitely was delicious.

Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. He was as attentive as he could be given that he seemed to be quite busy with number of tables ect.

All around me, it was being placed on table after table, people taking pictures with it, digging in.  It was only right.

The combination of sweet and savory is probably the best thing to ever happen in the culinary World.  Hash House is genius for this dish.  The first bite that I took, the sage in the waffle came through in the most major way possible.  But, what did it for me, was not just the sage, but the sage mixed with the savory, smokiness of the bacon and the sweet, maple flavor of the syrup.  Then, it's all on your fork with a juicy piece of fried, seasoned chicken.  Oh I was in Heaven.  I had never tasted anything like it!  Then, there were fried leeks all over the plate, I had never tasted those before and it worked.  It all worked so well together.  

I couldn't finish it all.  It was so much, I hated that I couldn't, but it was humanly impossible.  It's definitely a dish that can be shared, but my stingy self, didn't want to share either.

I expected a lot more out of them, but they're just waffles. This dish comes with a lot of just random things on it, I suppose for aesthetics. But you will really just ignore all that filler stuff.

However, all the other dishes are massive as well so unless you come with a party that shares the same purpose, do not plan on sharing.  Once I finished laughing at the size of the the dish and decided to actually try and eat some I realized I needed a plan of attack.  So I moved the chicken to one side of my dish and the waffles to the other.  Then I proceeded to cut a piece of chicken, a piece of waffles and then put them together to consume.  I was certainly a fan and like the salty sweet combination of the fried chicken bacon and waffle with syrup.  Despite my effort I could not finish the dish and took the rest to eat on the way to Zion Canyon National Park (by the way, it should be consumed immediately as the chicken is not as crunchy and and the waffles too mushy after sitting in a to go box).

After waking up at 3pm ... (remember, we're in Vegas)... so hungry. I wanted nothing more but to generously stuff my face. 

The portions are huge! All I could do at first was just stare at the humongous size. Well, only for half a second before my mouth began to attack the prey. 

1). Sage Fried Chicken - stacked with the famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks
2). Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - Andy's sage fried chicken w\/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs
3). House Smoked Fresh Salmon, cream cheese and scallions - House Hash - Tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w\/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit

Where do I begin. The sage fried chicken was so moist. OMG. Delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and has the right crisp when you bite into it. Juicy goodness. The bacon waffle was super good and it paired perfectly with the crispy chicken. The waffle was light, crispy, and fluffy! There were huge bacon bits in the waffle ... the combination of salty and sweet was amazing. Their homemade maple syrup drizzled on top of it ... MMM. Just made it even more amazing. 

The benedict was also good! CHIPOTLE cream sauce. Yummy. My only complaint was that they put a little too much cream sauce on top. It was a little hard to taste what I was eating since there was just so much sauce all over the dish.

The house hash salmon was decent! There was a good amount of salmon in the hash. The potatoes were cooked perfect! The scrambled eggs that came with it was nothing amazing.The biscuit was the size of two fists! O_o 

We had a bunch of leftovers for the next day! :D

Our waiter was excellent. He was so patient with us as we were not that hungry and couldn't decide what to order. We came at 4:30 pm and dinner starts at 5:00 pm so no seafood. 
We wound up ordering the #5 burger mainly because it had avocados and a side salad with chicken added on. Love the salad. The butter lettuce was very good and they added a biscuit. The croutons were huge and soft. I'm used to them being hard so I am going to say honestly I wasn't used to it. The cucumber dressing was a perfect compliment to the butter lettuce. It doesn't overwhelm the salad.  It was divine. 

I wish I could say the same for the burger. Hubby and I had to spilt the burger and it was... Disappointing. It supposedly boats of freshness. Got that from the salad. The burger patties truly seemed like they were the frozen kind that you defrosted and cooked. It wasn't the worst but it was just okay.

Bacon waffle was wack. Not hot. Butter didn't melt. Bacon was basically inserted into the waffle which was split open. He expected a bacon waffle meaning bacon pieces cooked into the waffle.

I think my wife (who almost usually always agrees with me heh heh) would agree with me that the chicken & waffles were more thoroughly enjoyable (from start to finish) than the benedict just because the benedict was quite a bit heavier.

Our group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. 

While the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. 

BUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. 
It was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. 

Many people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. 

Any meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT! Our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge.

Very popular 24\/7 breakfast place! Usually a 30-minute wait. 

Entrée: Tractor Driver Combo
Pancake or waffle with potatoes and eggs. Food was great! Waffle was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. Unfortunately, I was disappointed because they do not allow substitutions (I wanted toast instead of eggs).

The service is great, the ambiance is even better, and the food is second to none!

When I arrived at the Hash House A Go Go, I was immediately greeted by two women who promptly took down my name, asked about  my party size, and told me it would be a 15-20 minute wait (which ended up being a 10 minute wait). SCORE!

Once my party was seated (party of 2), our server came by and took our drink order. We embarked in casual conversation, while also listening to his recommendations on whats popular at the restaurant! Our server was outstanding! His food knowledge was great, and he really made our stay that much more enjoyable. He checked on us very often, always refilled our drinks without us having to ask, and always had a smile on his face. The service here is what makes The Hash House A Go Go standout from other restaurants on the strip, alongside their humongous food portions. 

I ended up ordering the Fried Chicken Benedict (as seen on Man V. Food) and let me say, its as amazing as everyone says it is! The portions are enough for three people, and considering this was my first time here, I attempted to finish the whole dish myself, which resulted in a fail.
My guest had the Banana Pecan French Toast, and let me tell you, these were the best french toast's I've ever had!

Both items were bursting with flavor, and made your taste buds dance! 

I would highly advise you to check this place out, you will not be disappointed! 

The Hash House plays great music, and they have a great restaurant layout. Pictures of famous people fill the walls, adding to the decor ambiance of the restaurant. 

The restaurant is inside the Plaza, and its worth the walk\/drive!

If this is your first time here, my recommendation is either the Fried Chicken Benedict (if you want something more lunch related) or the Banana Pecan French Toast, (if you want something more breakfast\/brunch related)

The pricing is amazing, considering the HUGE portions you get. (again all the dishes could be split for two people, it'll save you some bucks)

The bf and I shared:

- Fresh Market Tomato Salad: If you're gonna try a salad, try this one.  What won me over was the griddled crispy Parmesan cheese that topped the salad.  It was soo goood.

- NY Times Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower:  Okay, this is seriously something you HAVE to try when coming here.  There's BACON in the waffles.  Crispy fried chicken is so perfectly crispy.  Then there's the leek on top?!!  I loved it.  I personally didn't like to combine the two but I also didn't mind eating it side by side.  What can be wrong about fried chicken??? And there's definitely nothing wrong with waffles.  The two make a very nice couple.

I was also able to try one of my friends':

- Stuffed Burgers (you get to choose from about 3 different stuffings - he tried mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar cheese): I thought the burger was okay...it was a little bit on the dry side but all in all, I like the combination of flavors in the 1 pounder.

Fried Chicken and Waffles are my jam, I don't like eggs so I don't have a lot of breakfast foods I do like, but this combines the best of not just both worlds, but all worlds. The chicken was moist and juice, had a fantastic crisp noise when you broke into it. And the waffles, crisp enough with slabs of bacon just hanging out. All combined with maple syrup and you have a winning combination. We heeded many warnings and split it between two of us. Because of that we also allowed ourselves a side of crispy potatoes, which were good, just paled in comparison to whatever else we had going on on our tastebuds. It was all very intense, we got there around 9, just missing massive crowds, and we didn't eat again until dinner.",0,0,0

How many actual pounds of food did I ingest, and why, did I challenge myself to eat all of it? To be fair, I FAILED the challenge, but tried really hard.

Arrived around 11:30 AM on a Monday, and the wait for 2 was an accurate 35 minutes. Service was prompt, and while the wait for food itself was going to be about 40 minutes, our server was able to get our drinks and a small order of sweet potato fries out to us really quickly. The Tangerine Honey Screwdriver is a great twist on a classic cocktail, so I'd definitely recommend it.

We ordered the towering Chicken & Waffles, the Pot Pie, and a side of biscuits and gravy (""Do you know how much food that is?"" asks our server. ""Yes"", I say, ""I just REALLY want to try all of it."") While the C&W is impressive in presentation, it was probably my least favorite on the list, though it wasn't bad at all. The pot pie was really great - whatever is in their gravy is just on point. So flavorful. And their biscuits and gravy is just perfect. A bit of spice, the meat is awesome, and the biscuits were light and fluffy.

I always like to try new places out especially in Vegas and when I  randomly came across this place so I was instantly kind of skeptical.  Especially since it was located in imperial palace and i hadnt really noticed a major advertisement for it before. If you've ever seen a Great and glorious fast food ad on tv or online with the delicious mouth watering food and then once you get there and take your order it looks like someone beat your burger with their fist and just flung it in a bag and you was hungry half an hour later and you spent $20-30.
Well Once i googled a few images and menu I figured why not try it out. I didnt post a picture because my pictures will look just like everyone elses or I can say just like their appear on any internet search. Definitely not a false advertisement on that. This has by far been one of my Top places to go to in Vegas and Chicago regardless of the day, time or week. I have tried the majority of the menu or seen a friend try it like the burgers the size of your head stuffed wit mash or what ever else, the Dinner plate sized tenderloin sandwich, Chicken & waffles, the Kokimo and a few more.. Definitely worth the wait in line, the money and the couple hours spent trying to finish.
The only reason It wasnt 5 stars was because I'm a super harsh critic and a place would have to be the greatest thing on earth for 5 stars (or maybe i'm nitpicking) but I'm just saying little super minor things could be better like saying out of 10 its a 9.8
This place how ever is very very close: Good food, Not to much on the pockets, will have left overs, good service, good atmosphere, hope they'll add more to the future menu

My issue with this restaurant is with the food and nothing else. I ordered a cheeseburger, and my fiancé ordered an eggs benedict. My burger came out 11 minutes before her breakfast, causing my food to become cold. On top of that, I told our waiter that I was displeased with the presentation of my meal, because the fries on the plate were so bare that it looked as if someone had eaten off of my plate before they gave it to me. My fiancé's meal was the worst tasting food I've ever had. The potatoes were bland, the eggs were under-cooked (she ordered over-hard eggs, and they came out too runny to even be considered over-easy). The water they gave us was horrible, it tasted like they scooped our drinks out of the hotel pool.

You would think cornbeef for breakfast is too much but the dish itself was delicious! Warning though get gravy with your biscuit when your waiter asks you, I got jam thinking the biscuit would be fluffy but the biscuit was hard. It was biscuit fit for gravy! The chicken and waffle was delish as well! The waffle comes with bacon in the middle making the waffle moist and seasoned by the bacon grease. The chicken was cooked juicy with a crispy outer layer and tasted like there was minimal seasoning just the simple salt and pepper! Last but not least the HH pancakes were humongous! The plate came with fries and a bowl of fruit that were not really needed though because you'll get full just off the pancake! The pancake was great, fluffy, thick and moist!

They would not seat us until our entire party was there. The hostesses were very lovely and helpful. Our server was very polite and quick to provide service.
The menu was very diverse. I decided upon the sweetened mango iced tea and the chicken and waffles, yum. The iced tea was not OVER THE TOP sweet as other places tend to make it. It was just right.

The chicken's fry batter had rosemary and other delicious seasonings, not common among fried chicken. It was good. The chicken pieces themselves were two large plump thighs, perfectly cooked and juicy. These two thighs were served upon four bacon waffles. It looked like they slipped several slices of bacon in the waffle iron while the batter was being poured, mmm. Finally, a large steak knife and and a large sprig of rosemary were stabbed down into the two thighs and layer of waffles to hold the tasty tower in place. The entire dish was drizzled with flash fried green onions (yum!), small diced veggies, and a ginger Teriyaki sauce.

Tasty but overall too sweet, and too much of it; like trying to eat bananas foster alone for dinner. I barely ate half of the pancake.

At 11:45am on December 8th, six of us went for breakfast\/lunch, and were told there would be an hour wait...  Sure, no problem, we had been there multiple times before and had zero issues with the wait, we actually expected it. At around the 50 minute mark we checked back in just to be on the safe side, and were told it was close.  Needless to say, 45 minutes later (so now over an hour and a half wait) they were sitting multiple groups of 4 that put their names in while we were checking in at the 50 minute mark.  It took me standing at the host\/hostess table (which by the way had at least 5 employees standing around it) for them to finally sit us.  Low and behold, the dining room was at most, 50% capacity.  I even asked why they couldn't have made the 5 to 6 groups they let go in front of us wait while they pushed two table together, and I got the deer in the headlights look.

Ok, it gets better.  Ordered the famous BLT Bloody's, and they came without the B.  Not a big deal even though it's their claim to fame so to speak, but we were already a bit agitated to be honest...oh well, we blew it off and the server brought a plate of bacon.  

Finally our food comes out...well four (4) of the six (6).  The two missing orders, which were the Sage Chicken & Waffles never came...well correction, one order came out, but after the other 4 of us were done with our meals.  The waiter was protesting that sometimes it takes a while to make the chicken & waffles, and when we said we came here multiple times, then he said ""well sometimes it comes out first.""  Make up your mind man!  So the last order actually never came, even after we addressed all of this with the Manager.  

The Manager just looked at us like himself and his staff were doing us a favor by letting us eat there.  Nothing he said even suggested he cared!

Even though a lot of the dishes that passed by our table looked great, I stayed true to my original craving - the Chorizo Hash.  Man, talk about a massive serving of food!  My photo may not do it justice, but the cast iron skillet they brought out was huge, and the hash alone took up about half of it.  The other half?  Choice of eggs (scrambled), fruit, and a biscuit.  Not that it mattered in the end though since I barely cleared half of my order.

Sitting on top of soft and perfectly cooked chunks of potatoes was a tasty pile of ground chorizo.  YUM.  The ""taco meat""-like consistency was a little unexpected, but the seasoning of the ground chorizo and melted cheese was great.  Just a slight kick while the jalapenos gave it that extra heat.  All in all - deliciousness.

Still, knowing how good (and generous) the food is though, I wouldn't mind having to wait (a little).",7,11,8

We tried to reserve a table and half of us wanted to get seated and eat already, but the staff wouldn't allow it.  Their rule is so lame.  So they say by seating everyone at the same time, it will allow them to give the best service where everything is organized and food all comes out together so their service won't get messed up.  I just think that this is another way of saying they don't know how to multi-task.  Just sayin.  Oh, and my friends were pissed about this stupid rule!  Having to wait for people with a hungry stomach is the worst! 

Anyway, finally we got sat and ordered...

Everything my friends and I ordered looked incredibly good and mostly huge in portions.  We did it family style where we tried each others' food.

Fried chicken bacon waffles were bomb.
Corned beef hash was okay, but I wouldn't order that again.  The portion size was small.
Sage fried chicken benedict looked mouth watering and it tasted good too.
French fries were devoured in a heart beat.
Caesar salad was so plain and small; I wouldn't get that again.
The ribeye was huge and delicious.  
Kiwi water lemonade w\/ alcohol was good.  Make sure the waiter brings you one with alcohol in it if you order it.  There's a virgin type too, and the waiter had initially brought me this one.

First off, we waited 55 minutes for a table. Once getting seated our waiter informed us that it would be another 45 minutes for our food once we ordered. I wanted to leave right then and there but we waited out of sheer desperation. They should at least give you some bread or something to munch on if you're waiting that long. I got the first farm Indiana special, which was sage fried chicken, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit.
The chicken was extremely dry, and the only hint of sage flavor was the dry rosemary they threw on top.
The BACON mashed potatoes was just mashed potatoes with two slices of bacon on top. Not horrible, but deceiving from the menu description.
I got my eggs over medium. They were good, but how hard is it to mess up eggs?
The biscuit was good, but very dry and sucks up any ounce of moisture in your mouth without any butter or jam or syrup. 
The display was elaborate and pretty, ill give them that. And the portions were MASSIVE. But overall I'd save the money for this expensive meal and go to Denny's instead.",0,0,0

The place was PACKED. And I mean people in every nook and cranny waiting for a table. They told us it'd be an hour. Well we walked here from MGM so we said, fine we will wait. It was a bit chaotic and somewhat frustrating. Alas, they have a tiny bar, maybe 8-9 seats. We were watching it like a hawk, bam 2 people got up and we were on it like white on rice. So if you can get a seat there it's much better than waiting an hour.

The bartender was sweet and really great. They were obviously very busy but continued to talk to us. We both got mimosas which were definitely not shy on champagne. They were 8 bucks...not bad. 

My wife ordered the eggs with goat cheese, spinach, etc. It was delicious and of course a HUGE portion. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict...whoa! This thing was massive!!! It had a giant biscuit, maybe a whole chicken, bacon, tomato, mashed potatoes (lots and lots of mashed potatoes) and the most amazing chipotle sauce. That sauce was divine. There was no chance in hell I was finishing this. I didn't eat again until we got back to NJ around 1:30am and I still wasn't all that hungry. 

Overall, great service at the bar, fantastic flavorful food and decently priced drinks. The chaos of the line to get in is why I knock off a star, it was a mess.

My friends and I originally had an 11am reservation during a bachelorette weekend but due to conflicting arrival schedules and dead phone batteries, we weren't able to make it and they couldn't confirm seats at noon. A few of us decided to take the monorail over to the Linq and see what was so great about Hash House. Welp, they don't call the meals massive for nothing! The bride to be placed our orders at the front and the employee was super understanding when we realized the online Yelp menu is a bit outdated and some items aren't offered anymore. 

I ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles. O.M.G. How could an ordinary chicken breast be so perfectly crisp and flavorful outside but be so dang juicy on the inside?! It was so good I picked up the whole piece and just bit right into it! And this is coming from a girl that removes the skin from her chicken. The fried pieces of sage weren't that bad either. Not sure if I could actually eat those but I lived. When I first got my order I thought they gave me a pizza instead because it's a box of that size. Huge. 2 white meat pieces and oh! Almost forgot about the four waffle squares sliced with whole bacon stuffed in it. Didn't care much for the bacon and the waffles got kind of soggy but they tasted like buttermilk. 

Not sure what everyone else ordered so I can't comment on other items. To go orders (in person only, no phone orders) take around 40 minutes to prepare when it's busy so it's convenient to go back down the escalator you came up from and explore the casino, grab some coffee from Nook Cafe, or maybe something stronger from Purple Zebra.

Not a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!

I ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.

Every single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.

Strawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)

Rosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.

But then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.

6 years ago I was in Vegas and a local friend took me to this super hip place off the strip.  Back then they just had the one restaurant in Vegas and were, relative to today, very small. The food was amazing and so was the service.
Cut to present day: In town with my wife and I see there are more restaurants than the original.  We head to the one on the strip. Immediately, the ambience had that ""commercialized and branded"" feel.  When we sat down, our waitress was nice, yet overtaxed. Literally, 10 seconds after our order was given, someone showed up with food, obviously mistaken, and stormed off when we noted we had just ordered. A few minutes later, another person showed up with the wrong food.
Our food arrived. It wasn't horrible. In fact I liked it. However, I couldn't help but compare it to what it once was. In that comparison, the food was horrible.
I would have made this a 3 at least but that afternoon, the stomach issues started and really still haven't ""cleared"" up\/out completely a day later.
I was happy with our waitress and tipped 30%. She did a great job for the over taxed situation she was in.

BF originally wanted eggs Benedict, but saw that it was served over a biscuit and not an English muffin, so he opted for the chicken and waffles. After we placed our order, the waiter gave us a heads-up that it will take about 30 minutes for our food to come. We weren't particularly in a hurry, but we were hungry and a bit tired of waiting.

My order came first and it consisted of crispy potatoes with corned beef and melted Swiss cheese, two eggs, a biscuit the size of my fist, and a slice of watermelon and orange.

BF's order came and it consisted of two pieces of chicken, four bacon waffles, and fried leeks. Both the chicken and waffles were a bit dry, which was disappointing. 

Overall, the food was tasty (but not amazing), and the portions were pretty big. We (mainly BF) managed to finish everything except for the biscuit. At the end, BF and I said we could have shared the chicken and waffles and gotten a smaller dish instead of another full entree.

Do yourself a favor--if you're craving supreme chicken and waffles, cough up an extra 15 bucks and head on over to Bouchon at the Venetian. You won't regret it. 

Furthermore, the service was appalling. Apparently, it only takes a half a brain cell to work there. We noticed that our jam container was empty, so we put it at the edge of the table.

This place was crazy busy but we only had to wait 20 minutes or so.  Very nice young man as our server, gave us drinks and plenty of time to choose from the large menu.  We looked around at the size of the portions of some of the items and were totally intimidated.  The server told us many people share but since we like different items we opted to each get our own.

I had a skillet that had stir fried veggies over scrambled eggs, potatoes and a bisquit that was huge and pretty good although mine didn't seem completely cooked in the middle, sort of doughy.  My husband had eggs, sausage, potatoes and again the bisquit.  My complaint, the eggs even though the server told us everything was cooked to order so things didn't come out at the same time, were rubbery and not piping hot and the potatoes were not good at all.  I want my potatoes to be crisp and don't want a bunch of seasonings that take away from the potato and add a lot of spice to them.  Mine were way over cooked so didn't eat most of them.

We go to Vegas a lot and will probably go back at some point since we'd like to give it another try.  Based on the other reviews we wondered if we just got a bad meal for a one time thing.",0,0,0

I can't complain about the service because our server was very attentive. I ordered the smoked salmon scramble thinking it would be like the lox smoked salmon, instead I got chunks of weird tasting salmon. The pesto, melted Brie, and other ingredients were really nice together. I just had to pick out the main ingredient which was the salmon. Pretty disappointing.

Our Order:
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: ($16.99) sage fried chicken w\/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled Mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled Eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower: ($17.50) Sage Fried Chicken stacked w\/ bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks
Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: $5.50
Iced Pistachio Mocha: $6.99

WARNING: Portions here are HUGE!! It wasn't on Man vs. Food for a reason! I totally forgot how large the dishes are here and ordered too much as we were starving. First thing that came out of my mouth as it was placed in front of us, ""OMG. What did we just do?!"" As we were trying to tackle the dishes, we were watching other tables make the same mistake as we did and to hear their gasps were hilarious. We and most of the tables around us had to take the remainder of our orders to go. You have been warned!

I wasn't a fan of the fried chicken that they're so famous for as I didn't really taste the sage and the batter was really thick. Since the chicken is covered in sauces, it's not going to be crispy so it's basically a bunch of mush when you dig into it. I had ordered the Waffle Tower and was surprised that the bacon was actually INSIDE the waffle! I thought it would be layered between the waffles or bits sprinkled around.. but nope! Very nicely toasted so it had the slight crunch that I enjoy in my waffles (but still soft and airy on the inside). I also liked the biscuit in the Chicken Benedict as it was quite flavorful, soft, and slightly crumbly. Both dishes were merely ok in their entirety though.

In the Iced Pistachio Mocha, you're able to taste the pistachio but since I love the flavor, I would've liked it if it was stronger. It's mostly a sweet drink though so wouldn't say it's strong in the caffeine department. 

What I'd definitely would come back for is the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. It's so refreshing and sounds like a weird combination, but it's so good! I had the non-alcoholic version but next time I'll try their alcoholic one (if it's not too early in the day though).

The waitress that assisted us was cheery and friendly. We came here on a Friday afternoon around 2PM so it wasn't very crowded. Fairly easy to flag someone down when we needed something.

Having tried their famous dishes, I wouldn't order them again as there are so many other options to try. Hopefully I'll remember to share a dish the next time I come though!",2,0,1

The Corned Beef hash was pretty darn good with an egg over easy. I recommend ordering a side of the chipotle cream sauce to dip or drizzle on to this yum-o skillet. The biscuit is heavenly with the daily fresh made strawberry preserves. 

From the time I was seated, it took 35 minutes to receive my food. That provided me tons of time to check out the fast paced employees running amuk to do their jobs. Next time, I'm getting a pancake for sure. Those looked incredible.

Best IMO was their well-known Sage chicken and waffles! Even though I am an LA guy who likes Roscoes, this was so much better! Smoked bacon is layered in the middle of the waffles! The chicken is fried to perfection & was complemented by all sorts of tasty herbs & flavors while infused w a maple reduction! 

The only entree that was iffy was the Chicken Benedict. Hollandaise sauce had some kick, so that might surprise you. 

Cinnamon roll expresso was yummy but the smore coffee drink was wayyy too sweet and sticky for me!

If I would have gotten chicken and waffles, may have been better and more moist. Kids got pancakes off the kids menu. One was still so big, my 3 Boys could have shared. Other son got a waffle that was also moist & good. Presentation and service was awesome!!!
We will go back and wait for a table again. It's worth it!!",1,1,1

The portions are ginormous and the food is ridiculously delicious! Each dish is big enough to share amongst two people so unless you're super hungry, I would recommend sharing. 

This place is a hidden gem inside the dinky Imperial Palace. For brunch, we ordered the Man Vs. Food favorite, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It looked like a scrumptious heart attack served on a platter. It came with perfectly scrambled eggs, crispy fried chicken (a tad on the salty side), thick slices of smoked bacon, slices of tomatoes, a sprinkle of fresh spinach, a heaping amount of mashed potatoes, and a light flaky biscuit all smothered in their chipotle cream sauce with a stick of rosemary on top. Typically, I don't like it when everything is mixed together, but it was so good we cleaned the plate! We also got their Snickers Flapjacks, which was the size of a medium pizza! It tasted like a chocolate chip pancake - not too shabby.

This place sucks!  Been to others but this is the worst. Everything stops to seat just one table. A group of seven and the hostess can not seem to figure out she can seat other groups while they wait for the seven. 

The staff has time to fart around with each other but can not do what they get paid for.

So we just went into the restaurant and we past 6 empty tables. This is just stupid. Where is the Managment? Do they let this one do what ever she wants. 

Oh yeah 25 min still no waiters.  

Ok. So we saw the waitress. Took our order. We pointed out that my wife's fork was sticky. They got the bus person you just cleared the table behind us to get new silverware. Did not wash his hands and then proceeded to touch our silverware. (Just to note, I am in food safety.) So what ever yuck the couple had got on their forks, then the bus persons hand, then onto my fork then yuck into my food (if I had not noticed).

Just GROSS. 

So the food came. Mine 7 min before my wife's. So, my fault, I guess. I waited for my wife to eat and then mine was just not warm. But that being said it tasted ok. Now my eggs were wrong but they did quickly fix the error. 

So time to check out again a line really!

We weren't worried about the wait because there is stuff to do in the casino but do plan accordingly. The line never seemed to die down while we were there. 

We were given a booth in under the time they predicted. The menu is American food but many options. Disclaimer, the portions are huge and everything is under 20 bucks. Awesome deal in vegas. I ordered a pineapple mimosa (it was brunch after all) to start with while perusing the menu. I decided on the sage fried chicken with grilled mashed potatoes topped with bacon, eggs, and a biscuit. 

Like I said the portions are huge- I probably could have shared my dish (we all could have) but we decided to each get our own portion. The food was delicious. The chicken was moist, crispy, and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were on point (it was really like a mountain it was so much). The biscuit was delicious and I love a good biscuit.

Even though you look and read it in your mind or out loud and sounds soooo delicious, it was just pleasant. It didn't wow me or had me like OMG but it definitely filled me up. 

Presentation  was awesome! It was a tower of awesomeness that I thought I could devour. The chicken wasn't bad because it was crispy on the outside and white meat in the inside. I wish the bacon was more crispy though instead of soggy because of the cream. The biscuit was huge and dense that I wan't really feeling it especially with the mash potatoes right under it. Mad carbs! The chipotle cream was really good as it had a little spice to it but wasn't overpowering. It was too much carbs though. Oh wait I said that.  It did cure my hangover but I don't think I would get this again although I am down to try other things on the menu.

I had the chorizo hash with eggs.  I hardly made a dent in the giant skillet.  It was very good but not as spicy as one might expect.  I also ordered a Smores latte.  Wow so good, but I seriously could feel Wilfred Brimley yelling something about diabetes.

I love breakfast foods... It's one of my favorite things to eat.  I usually love breakfast for dinner. However, when I'm in Vegas we eat whenever there is a break between clubbing, napping, and getting ready. After going to the club one night I convinced some of the girls I was with to stop and eat. I think they were drunk enough to follow me so we ended up here. I saw the chicken and waffles on yelp and I knew they had to be mine.

The table wanted the chicken and waffles too but I also wanted a pancake. Little did I know that it was going to be way TOO MUCH food! We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower for 18.00. It comes with drizzled hot maple syrup & fried leeks. I also ordered The Pancake Tractor Driver Combo for 14.29 ($1 for specialty pancakes). It came with eggs, bacon, hash browns and a buttermilk pancake. I substituted brown sugar pancakes. I also got egg whites and chicken sausage since I don't eat pork. I had to save calories where I could. I didn't realize I was going to be able to put a dent into my food.

I got the chicken and waffles based on the waiter telling me it was their most famous dish and my husband got the basic which is their standard breakfast. I also got a side of eggs.

The chicken and waffles looked really fun and cool, but the waffles were dry and left much to be desired. The fried chicken was pretty good out of everything we ordered, but needed some seasoning. The side of eggs I ordered was fried and over hard, they came with the yolks all over them, which is not what I wanted as I ordered them that way to avoid eating the yolk. They also were drenched in oil. My husband's breakfast was more standard, but also was huge and drenched in oil and nothing great about it.

I ordered a side of strawberries with whipped cream. It cost me $6 for 5 strawberries!! I wish the waitress would have told me that.

Huge chunks of well-seasoned fried chicken, with a thicker, crisp breading exactly the way I like it, layered on top of a [slightly boring] biscuit, but made exciting again with spinach, mozzarella, tomato, bacon (hold the bacon, please) eggs (it comes with scrambled but I like it with over-easy yolky eggs) and a chipotle cream 'hollandaise' sauce.

All this on top of perfect shredded hashbrowns. Even the embellishments are 'look at me!' too. A huge rosemary sprig out its mountainous top, and what tastes like deep-fried spaghetti noodles sprinkled all over the whole thing. 

The wait can be long depending on when you get there, but the service is always SO FRIENDLY. I think it's because when you look around the dining room, everybody is beaming their fool heads off. Makes for a good working environment :)

But first I must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when I went to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago. I saw it on the food network and travel channel. Apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the Vegas strip in the Quad.

Upon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. That being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! Worth it in the end though.

As we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. In my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. I felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. The first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. Out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! The ones were the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Big O' Chicken Pot Pie and the Chorizo House Hash. Full menus are online, but each dish was super! 

My personal favorite was the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. This was superb! The sage really was present in the fried chicken and was totally different from any other ""chicken & waffles"" I ever had. The taste was really ""upscale"" but very, very good! The other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. I am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that I had never had before. The fried chicken was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! The Everyone loved the waffles! Very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. And it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...Such a dream! 

The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was similar in taste as far as the fried chicken portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. Very rich and good.

The last two were the Chorizo House Hash and Big O' Chicken Pot Pie. Both were the favorites among the group as a whole. The chorizo was very good, not too salty, which I have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. A bit spicy with the jalapeños, but I love spice personally. Everyone devoured this dish as well as the Pot Pie. The shell\/crust of the pot pie was mouthwatering. That part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the roasted chicken filling and gravy!

I must say these dishes individually are Large! Just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. And for the price, very worth it! Each dish was presently superbly especially the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.

Get this, girl did not even put our name down! We gave her my boyfriend's card and everything and she did not put it down.  It wasn't that we were annoyed that we weren't seated yet, it was more so that she had all these other names written down but ours.

Thankfully an awesome hostess came by named tammy or kami and helped us out and we were seated right away.  From there service was pretty good.  They were busy, like last time, but managed to get our orders in time and correct.  My boyfriend got his 'ol time favorite the andy's sage fried chicken.  And yours truly???? Well, if you read my previous review I wasn't too happy with my last dish.  This time changing it up made a world of a difference.

Have you ever read any of Emi H.'s reviews  in Honolulu?? where she talks about food and dating?! I'm here to tell you it is absolutely positively TRUE!  When it comes to courting food you look for certain qualities that will WOW your tastebuds and keep you coming back for more.  When you're dating you're looking for qualities that complement you and vice versa and yes keep you coming back for more fun times, memories, pictures, whatever tickles your pickle!  

This visit to hash house was equivalent to falling in love... =)  I ordered the:
Hash House original  w\/smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach,roasted red pepper cream and topped w\/ two basted eggs for $11.95.

I started with the BLT Bloody Mary , the Bacon was good.....I left half my drink , there was something tangy missing in the drink it was just your basic mix with Tabasco....

For lunch I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, It was this towering plate with massive pieces of food, the Honeydew melon slice on it was delicious, the chicken breast was dry, it had scrambled egg on top of the fried chicken which was decent and sharp cheddar cheese on top of that.....The cheese tasted burnt with an aftertaste , all that was on top of a layer of mashed potatoes which were decent in taste, there was also some slices of tomato and spinach leaves....I left most of the food not because it was too much but because it did not taste great as the legend says. The melon was great though.

After getting off of work with my boyfriend and his sister at around 3am, we decided we wanted breakfast and chose to go to hash house a go go. We knew the hype about it so we thought, why not?? 

Only my bf's sister and I ordered food and we got what was something we didn't expect. We ordered the same thing which was French toast with a caramelized banana on top with pecans and sliced oranges (wtf are the oranges for?), bacon, and eggs. 

What we thought would be delicious was actually unpleasant. The French toast was a little dry, the bacon wasn't crispy, and the eggs tasted like powdered eggs. But that wasn't the worst part. Literally after THE FIRST BITE WE TOOK, our waitress dropped our check and said,""I'm just going to drop this here. Don't worry, no rush."" WTF? We just got our food! What if I wanted a drink? Or dessert? We work in the food industry and dropping a check without asking if the food was okay, if we wanted drinks, dessert, etc., that's a big NO NO. We were there all of half and hour. That was rude as f***.

Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it's finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It's American comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.

So many times when a place ""creates"" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I've ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it's namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  It seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.
The masterpiece... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kg

I also got a chance to try the Big O' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQ

My wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn't seem that they are really ""stuffed"" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17A

I'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter's plain pancake was one of the best I've ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3\/4 inch thick.  For sure I'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWg

Food: HUGE, HUGE portions. My husband and I split an order Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. We still didn't finish it. It's definitely good for 3-4 people. He also got a side order of biscuits & gravy. Being from the south, he said the gravy was terrible & tasted burnt and didn't end up touching it the rest of the meal. The biscuits on both of the plates were unseasoned, bland, floury. I got a side order of the crispy potatoes, which I used to replace the mash & biscuit on the chicken benedict. Those were delicious.

Service: We got there not too early on a Thursday morning. Maybe just around 8am. We got seated almost immediately. Service was friendly (nothing special), but definitely very slow. When we left there was a huge line of people waiting.

Overall, I don't think it's worth it if you have to wait more than 15 minutes since service is already slow and it is damn pricey (but on par with the rest of Vegas).

Speaking of which, to my surprise there was a HHAGG Location inthe Imperial Palace!!! I was pumped when I found out, cause I was staying next store at the Flamingo! 

So, speaking of the Imperial Palace, I would never step foot in this place if it wasn't for the HHAGG. I didn't know what to expect when I heard the restaurant was in this hotel. 

But........ 

Boy was I surprised! HHAGG was a Gem in the hotel. What a awesome job with the restaurant! Very pleased. 

Important!!! Please READ! 
Breakfast from like 830 am-11am was rocking! Anywhere from 30min to an hour wait! We stopped back around 11:30\/11:45 and we were seated right away and I was able to get breakfast food still (limited menu) 

I ended up getting the The Tractor Driver Combo 
Two Eggs w\/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. Make it a waffle or french toast for a buck. $13.95

I noticed that some people complained about the wait time & service--this might depend on what time you show up.

We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict (favorite of man vs. food).  This was about $15 something.  Since I heard the portions were huge, my husband & I decided to share this plate.  Both of us left stuffed. (FYI: my mom said she went here a while back & they didn't let her get an extra plate to share food, but we had no problem).  It's hard to describe the flavor of this delicious bad boy, because it was so good!  The blend of flavors was just awesome.  It has: chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, biscuit on top of griddled potatoes.  I would go back again & order the same dish---never tasted anything so good!

We also ordered a pancake from the ""children's menu."" for my 2 year old.  That thing was HUGE....of course, she only ate like 4-5 bites and that was it.  I think about 3-4 kids could share this.  It was around $3 and pretty tasty---syrup was warm and really good.

The waiter brought out our bill kind of early: ""I know how it is with a child, so I'm just leaving this here for when ever you're ready.""  We didn't mind, because our daughter was getting fussy, but I can see how others might take this the wrong way.

*The large orange juice was $6, which I thought was expensive.

I'll definitely come here again, but only if I share a plate.  There were many people taking left overs home and I did see everyone ordering their own plate (not sure if this is a rule, if people just eat a lot, or people want left overs to take home).  I'll share a plate next time or will make sure my hotel has a fridge\/microwave.",0,0,0

The ceiling is slow. The air conditioning is set on energy-saver mode. There is an elevator that takes you up. I mean I pushed the button. I couldn't quite tell, if it was moving up or merely idling. The light for the buttons was broken. The air conditioning definitely didn't reach in there. Sweat was pouring down my front, back, everywhere. ""Las Vegas has them now,"" the line from the movie Hangover flashed in my head. There definitely was no telling, if I'd get out of this elevator.

Eventually, the door opened one floor higher. The restaurant was equally aged. The web site promised farm fresh produce. That made me think of healthy food. It's not healthy. It's super sized Southern portions. OMG, I had a tower of waffles with a pile of fried chicken on top. Someone stabbed a knife through it to keep it from toppling. It was at least a foot high.

It was chicken. It's engrained in Black DNA not to do bland. How do you even think to cook chicken and not even put your finger on the damn seasoning cabinet? That in and of itself was disrespectful.

For clarification, I visited here because my ""friends"" on Facebook said that it was the place to go. I put friends in quotes because clearly I need to reexamine this list if they'd ever recommend a place that didn't even pinch the salt for their fried chicken. I had the sage chicken and waffles. I think they just called it sage-y because they wanted to be able to charge you for putting that lone a** piece of sage on your plate for decoration because you d*mn sure couldn't taste it. I guess you're supposed to bite the chicken and then eat one of the sage leaves...kind of a do your own blending thing? I dunno. They also said that the waffles were made with bacon in it. The waitress swore that this dry bread with bacon bits (no, for real....the joints you put on a salad) was ""amazingly good."" Lies. She. Told.

I will say that they DO give really large portions. Two people could easily split the chicken and waffles and leave the restaurant with a full belly without issue. But the food itself (and my waitress*) left a lot to be desired. 

Oh, the fries were good (I ended up eating this because of the disrespect to my person with the water flavored chicken). Speaking of water...the water was DISGUSTING. I'm not sure if it's the pipes in Vegas but it just ""tasted"" filmy. Also, don't order tea in Vegas and think it's gonna be sweet like we do in the south. I seriously wanted to flip all the tables over in that restaurant when I tasted that peach tea that was literally brown water with a half a squirt of unsweetened peach flavoring.

Waitress: oh it's not sweet to you?

Me: not at all.

Waitress: the peach is what adds the sweetness.

Me: y'all must've made it with some out of season peaches then.

Anyway, two thumbs down for me. My plate was gross, unseasoned, couldn't enjoy the water, and I'm mad that Vegas still hasn't taken a queue from the south when it comes to sweetening tea.

* = our waitress didn't come back to check on us, didn't offer to refill any drinks on the table, and we had to look for her when we were ready for our check. Again, I'm not sure what food or service everyone else received but my own definitely wasn't worth more than 2 stars (which I left only because the fries were really good. I love fries).",6,15,1

Waited 20 minutes for a table, the host greeted us, he was very polite.  Our waitress seemed high energy.  I start with a latte, they don't have nonfat milk just so you know, it was alright.  I ordered the salmon hash.  I do ask the crazy questions before ordering like substituting whites for full eggs, no cheese etc.  I've turned to a calorie counter so this is important.  He orders the Fried chicken benedict, no substitutions, as is.  Thirty minutes later, two people have to bring out our food because the benedict requires to hands, one for the plate and one to support the benedict so it doesn't fall down.  The benedict consisted of a split chicken breast fried, 2 biscuits split in half, at least a pound of mashed potatoes, fried cheese, spinach, tomatoes topped with a hollandaise sauce.  He ordered with the pistachio mocha which tasted like hersheys chocolate and pistachio extract, I would pass on that drink and it cost about $6.
So the benedict, he ended up picking out the chicken and some potatoes and the spinach, the rest was just too mediocre.  It could feed at least 4 people.

My meal, which cost extra mind you because of my substitutions didn't come out right, they had to have been a half pound of brie cheese, though I said no cheese.  The waitress did ask if I wanted a new one, but I was disappointed with the flavors anyways, why wait another half hour?  So the waitstaff is a 5, but the food is pushing a 2\/3.  Not very cheap.

Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.
Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.

- Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.

The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.
My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?
The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.

I ordered the chicken and waffles and OH MY GOODNESS -- words can not describe how delicious this meal was. The portion was huge! It is easily shareable between 2-3 people. The chicken was incredibly juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The waffles were fluffy and had real pieces of bacon inside! The customer service was equally as great. Our waitress was always checking up on us and kept our waters filled.

This has got to be some of the nastiest food I have ever had in my entire life!! This place is beyond overrated and the service simply sucked (almost had to knock a waitress out) . My hubby and I were here over Labor Day weekend and the wait was not that bad only 10 minutes or so. While we were waiting the hostess called the name ""Tasha"" several times looking at me as if that were my name. I guess she must have thought all black girls go by the name of Tasha. That should have been a sign of what was to come. Once they called my husbands name (Scott not Tasha) we go and get seated. Some dumb pierced up airhead was our waitress. I asked her what was the best thing on the menu she suggested the chicken and waffles and then she goes into describing to me what a waffle is. Like.. OK. I noticed how big the portions were by looking at the patron's plates and I told her that my husband and I would like to share the entree. She then goes into telling me about the split fee. Which I didn't mind paying but she thought that was a big deal. After she gave us the split fee speech she went away. About 10-15 minutes later she brings my guy some mango iced tea which tasted like toilet water. While trying to flag down the waitress the bartender noticed that we had been flagging our waitress down for several minutes. The bartender then comes to our table and apologizes and brings my guy out a Sprite. About 10 minutes later some dude comes out with our plate of food. Which by appearence looked really tasty. Let me tell u this looks are very, very deceiving. The chicken was like cardboard dry and the waffles were even drier than the chicken. I tried to flag down the waitress again for a side of butter and syrup just so I could try to flavor this food up. She never came but the bartender came to her rescue and brought out some butter. The waitress then came by the table and I asked her for a side of syrup which she never brought out. After trying again to eat the cardboard disguised as food we realized that it wasn't even worth waiting for the syrup we tried flagging down the waitress again. This time she comes by the table with a major attitude. Since I could sense her attitude I asked her politely if we could order something else because our meal was not edible. She then throws a menu at me and states""what do you want"". I was like taken back by her attitude and told her to ""take this $hit"" (the nasty food). I then tell my husband that I can't deal with this ghetto a$$ place anymore and I leave. My husband stays upstairs and is forced to pay for cardboard food that we didn't even eat. Unless you are used to eating cardboard and drinking toilet water, I would not suggest u to EVER go to this hell hole. Hash House A Go Go needs to go Hash House a Bye Bye!! EPIC FAIL!!!!",3,0,1

Had the Chicken Benedict, which was basically a pile of eggs on top of fried chicken on top of bacon on top of a biscuit on top of potatoes covered in some cheese and sauce.  Pretty damn good.
Portion sizes are still huge no matter what you get, whether it's the hashes or the 1lb burgers, so it'll soak up the juice and then u can go party some more and chuck it up later.

The restaurant is clean and there are tons of pics of celebrities who have dined at Hash House (Channing Tatum was my fiancée's favorite but whatever).

The food, well the portions are massive!  I got the Andy (a man v food fave) and my fiancé got biscuits and gravy.  On portion size this place should receive 6 or 7 stars.  If you want people you don't know at other tables to stare at you with ""are you really gonna eat all that"" face as your food is delivered, then eat here.  The quality?  Well, it starts off strong as a 5 star experience but since the portions are so huge as you progress, your toppings and sauce get less and less, meaning your last bite is two stars while the first one is five.

After he briefly blanched at the size of the entrees, hubby finally decided to go with the sage fried chicken w\/ maple reduction, eggs, biscuit and bacon mashed potatoes. It was the perfect cure.

Since I'd already been there a few times, I wanted to try something new, and decided to og with the meatloaf w\/ 2 eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuit.

But the attitude we go when we asked how long it would be initially is what I was not ok with. These hostess seemed to be upset that we were even there. Sorry for wanting bacon waffles i guess? 
Also after we were finally sat It took 45 minutes to get bloody Mary's. I was starting to worry if they were fresh growing tomato's. it took that long, like C'mon man. 

We will be back again for the food, without a doubt.",1,0,0

How about praise for the terrific service? I got into Vegas late and hungry,  walked over to Hash House around midnight, and sat at the bar. The bartender\/server's name was Fonda, and she treated my half-awake, bewildered self as if I were the customer she had been waiting to see all day. She made me a BLT Bloody Mary in no time flat, and it was great-- and so generous with the alcohol that it scared me a little. 

I ordered the famous sage fried chicken and bacon waffles that everyone on Yelp said were fantastic. I am here to tell you, everyone on Yelp is telling the truth. It's delicious-- like, the kind of delicious where you try to commit the flavors to memory so you can attempt to vaguely duplicate it at home. Two people can easily share this meal. Both Fonda and another (male) server were very attentive without being overbearing, and I felt very appreciative to feel so welcomed as soon as I arrived in Las Vegas. And this place is really perfect for Vegas: Mom's home cooking, but larger than life and more luxurious!

The place is cute. It was a little confusing to find at first, but it's upstairs in the Quad, right next to The Linq. If you are in the Flamingo and walk out the door that leads to the Linq, it's more or less directly across the path. You just have to go into the building and follow the escalators upstairs.",4,0,2

I get mine from finding great places to eat breakfast.  I'm not really sure how I began my love affair with artery-clogging hash browns and German chocolate pancakes, but I don't forsee it ending any time soon.  I'm of the opinion that the very best breakfasts weigh down your tummy like a bowling ball made of sausage, which is probably why I had such a blast at Hash House-A-Go-Go.

On the recommendation of a friend who used to live in Vegas, my girlfriend and I ate at Hash House on the second day of our recent vacation.  I ordered eggs mixed with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes and (I believe) basil, served with a homemade biscuit and fried mashed potatoes.  I've had goat cheese and sundried tomatoes together on pizza but never mixed in eggs.  The combination was every bit as tasty as I'd hoped it would be.  The fried mashed potatoes took me back to the pre-microwave days of my childhood, when my mom would reheat the mashed potatoes she'd made the day before in a pan filled with melted butter.  The biscuit, which was significantly denser than I'd thought it would be, felt like it weighed half a pound.  If I'd eaten it with butter and jelly, I might not have felt very fondly about it.  However, on our table was a small metal tin filled with delicious jellied peaches, which turned out to be the perfect topping for Hash House's ridiculously heavy pastries.

Hash-House-A-Go-Go offers friendly service and excellent breakfast food served at reasonable prices.  For me, the best part of my Hash House experience was watching my tiny girlfriend try to eat a giant pancake that was at least 18"" in diameter.  She literally begged me to help her finish it but I was halfway to a food coma myself.  You win this round, breakfast!  But I'll be back.  Sooner or later, I'm always back for more.",0,0,0

Also ordered an omelette - pretty good!

Pros:
Dem biscuits!  YUM.
Excellent and attentive service
Flavors are decent, when the ingredients themselves can shine.  Avoid dishes smothered in cheese and sauce
$$ is worth it for the portion size

Cons:
Lineup:  we went at 12:00 - 35 min lineup

HHAGG is known for their Enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the Sahara location several times including the Man v Food shooting so we were hoping to see the SAME food,service and atmosphere as the original.

The entry\/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. The dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. A few TV's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.

When we arrived there was NO line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. This place is well staffed so they keep it moving.

We ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-I got the fried pork tenderloin sandwich & fries and My son @milesdavisvegas got the Farmer's Daughter-French Toast w\/bacon & eggs.

It took awhile for the food to come out -I had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and Our waiter was NEW,actually his 1st day on the job.

The pork tenderloin was FANTAsTIC-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!

The french toast was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked PERFECTLY over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!

I'm a little biased towards this place because its 1\/2 places in Las Vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so I don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin BUT I see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)

I see the Reviews on YELP really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. The service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.

Being a chicken and waffle fan, I absolutely had to see what the rave was about on their chicken and waffle dish. Their menu didn't really offer a wide variety, however they did have chicken and waffles and burgers. I ordered both. The food comes in very large portions; so unless you have a huge appetite, I'd probably recommend sharing since the meals go about $20 bucks a plate. Needless to say, the chicken and waffle kind of disappointed. It was very well presented, however coming from Texas we have way better chicken. This chicken tasted really bland and kind of tasteless. A thing that I thought was cool however, was that they battered their waffle mix with bacon and cook it into the waffle.
The burger was more enjoyable than the chicken and waffle. 
Overall, pretty decent meal on the strip and great that it's open 24\/7. I believe we came here around 3 an after gambling at Planet Hollywood.

- portions are ridiculous and filled with carbs. my eggs benedict had ONE fried egg on top of two biscuits and a pile of mashed potatoes.

Its noted that this is Mans vs Foods Favorite meal for those who don't know is Adam Richman who goes around and try to find the best grub in the world. 

Biscuit: 
the bottom layer of the entree, was fluffy and buttery 
Fried Chicken: 
Not crispy enough to my liking perhaps the gravy made it soggy before it reached the table. 
Bacon: 
Was not crispy yet again to my liking, was a bit soft. 
Benedict Eggs: 
Eggs with green\/red\/yellow peppers and cheese. It was soft and gooey 
Gravy: 
I believe they added too much corn starch to the gravy it was thick and bland. 
Mash Potatoes:
very hefty serving of bland and not enough buttered potatoes. 

Bacon Waffle: ($10.95) 
4 huge slices of Waffles w\/bacon literally inside of it. The waffle had too much flour in it. There is also chipotle seasoning on the bottom. Do not order the waffle! 

Hash House Cobb Salad: ($13.95)

Seriously? I mean, it was good for breakfast\/brunch but it was NOT as amazing as everyone raves about. 

We waited about 45 minutes alongside every other person awake in Vegas at 9:00am on a Saturday. After we were finally seated (6 of us), we looked around at so many empty, clean tables! Very odd.

I ordered a scramble (came with a biscuit, melon slice, and potatoes) and the serving wasn't that incredible and I almost ate it all (I'm 110lb and petite). My potatoes weren't hot and my melon wasn't ripe. It just wasn't that impressive. The only thing I did enjoy was the coffee. Tasty coffee!

Had a similar experience at the one in Summerlin so it's probably just an indicator of the service and the FOOD.  

It was so packed it was hard to see much except the crowd and the aforementioned wait had us edgy to get going on our drive back to LA, so I didn't have much time to take in the decor.  Corrugated chrome and a farm gone slightly off seem to be the main theme.  They even have a kiosk that lets you take a selfie to prove you waited a long time for breakfast in there.  For such a high turnover of customers the serving staff are on fire.  They keep your water and coffee full and they tell you they don't keep anything under heat lamps so your food comes out hot and fresh though all in all, I don't think we were waiting very long.  Maybe 10 minutes tops?  

The ""off"" theme, now that I consider it, must have something to do with aliens or government experiments with growth serums.  The food portions are not generous.  They're off the wall ENORMOUS!  I knew this going in, so I suggested we split an entree.  However, he wanted a pancake so we ordered a single blueberry pancake to go with the Fried Chicken and Eggs.  Even so, the healthy sized chunk of fried chicken breast (their batter is SO good - didn't like it as much at Summerlin location), the pile of rich mashed potatoes over bacon, perfect over medium eggs and fluffy awesome biscuit had to be mostly transferred into a styrofoam box at meal's end along with half of the 16"" x 2"" blueberry pancake they amusingly call a side.

So I decide to stop by one morning for late breakfast while in vegas. Got here early and put our names down. Within the next 10 minutes or so the place filled up quickly and there was a long wait. Couple of my friends were running abit late so they didn't seat us since all the parties weren't there. So we kept getting pushed back till my friends arrive and they keep calling other parties before calling us. We were furious plus it doesn't help I was so hungry prior to getting there and one of my friends husband was on his lunch break. So the wait ended up being almost an hour, and the food was mediocre at best. Seriously? I got the waffles with eggs and the portions were pretty big but they tasted plain and  nothing special other than their portions being huge.

After being seated initially we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who was very knowledgeable of the menu and made recommendations. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict (featured on man v food) and my friends ordered burgers. First off the portions are very large, I'm a Farely robust male myself but finished 25 percent of my meal. The negative aspect was my friends had wax paper in his burger which I didn't expect from such a renown restaurant. Luckily the chef made the burger again himself and brought it out to us apologizing and comped my friends burger.

I have visited the Tractor Room in San Diego and loved it (their other restaurant with the same menu) and read all the positive reviews on Yelp for Hash House, so I was expecting it to blow me away. It didn't, but it wasn't bad either. William was an EXCELLENT server, extremely friendly, helpful and a great attitude. I'd recommend him to all patrons. 

I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the chicken was rather bland. They need to add some spices to the seasoning. Or how about just add any kind of seasoning at all? The waffles had bacon cooked inside of it which I wasn't expecting. I would have preferred normal waffles and bacon on the side. I found it strange the waffles didn't come with butter and I had to request it. I know, I made my chicken and waffles dish even healthier with the butter. I did enjoy the coffee and my mother's blueberry and pecan pancake was very good. Next time in Vegas I'll skip this place and try somewhere else.

The menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as the O'Hare of the Dog which is a 14oz Budweiser and a side of bacon! Or the BLT Bloody Mary. They are known here for their Fried Chicken and Waffles which are extreme for sure. Please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. The service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of ""punk rock"" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. I never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..But I did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. The home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right I said GIRTH!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. This went the same for their signature ""hashes"" for breakfast. The ""crispy potatoes"" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...I had the ""Smoked Salmon"" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes I could have hoped for...Although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. The ""stuffed"" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish mashed potatoes. I got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. There was SOOO much horseradish on the taters that I literally coughed them right back up. I know I know..Sorry for the visual, but I don't want any fellow Yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.

We knew the portions were huge and a doggy bag was not an option. So, we decided to share two dishes. But because they frown upon that, we ordered an additional side so they had no issue with three people chowing down on two entrees.

We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks and a side of bacon. In addition, based on some other Yelp reviews, we ordered the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade.

The lemonade was super potent and overly sweet. Even after mixing thoroughly, it was way too much to drink straight. Since I had an unsweetened iced tea, we added a lot of that to the lemonade which made it bearable. Perhaps cutting it with a portion of water (or tea) would make it easier for most to drink.

The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was made to be a visual showstopper. That was all. I was disappointed because I had been worked up by veterans of this dish. Sure, it was a monstrous pile of food with a huge steak knife and rosemary sprigs holding it together. Sure, it had bacon in the waffles. Sure, it had sage fried chicken. But my opinion went down as I started eating it. The chicken seemed overcooked and dry. I couldn't taste any sage. The waffles were more dense and the bacon didn't really add much. The bright note were the leeks which were very tasty, but not tasty enough to save this dish.

The Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks was really a single flapjack that was so huge it hung over the sides of the plate, and it was already a huge plate to begin with. The flavor was good and a great size to share between three people.

I think the most memorable thing was the side of bacon. I was afraid that it would be overkill because there was bacon in the waffles. But this was thick cut hardwood smoked bacon so it was crispy and juicy and super flavorful. Probably some of the best, if not *the* best, bacon I've had.

Parking at the Imperial Palace was a bit tricky since there weren't easily visible signs indicating that we were entering the IP garage. If you're not comfortable with driving along the strip, I would recommend taking the tram from another hotel on the strip to the IP.

The amount of food you get is a plus, but if this is your first time, I would recommend going with a big group and ordering one chicken and waffles to share between everyone. That way you can try more things on the menu.",0,0,0

We ordered the Turkey special (this being Thanksgiving lunch) as well as the fried sage chicken special made famous by the Man vs. Food show -- recommended by our waitress. Both were fair to middlin' on the taste side but did not live up to the hype. Our total bill for two entrees came up to about $55 after all taxes and a 20% tip.

My criticism hinges on two small but critical issues concerning their policy.

My wife wanted biscuits or bread to hold us over the (waitress promised) forty minute ordering wait (after the half hour seating wait). We were given one (one!) lone biscuit but later found that we were charged $4.50 for this one lone biscuit. Had we known biscuits cost $4.50 each at this place -- we wouldn't have ordered them. Most nice restaurants will _NOT_ charge you for bread or biscuits (including say a certain nice food outlet from the 'Outback' where we had lunch the day before). I am still amazed that even after I discussed this politely with a manager -- he stood his ground on charging us. So -- don't order biscuits  while waiting unless you want to pay $4.50 each. You've been warned...

Second -- I noticed that the hugeness of the portions were primarily due to overly generous (and inexpensive) helpings of mashed potatoes, mashed yams and multiple examples of the formerly mentioned biscuits accompanying the 'good' parts (chicken, beef etc.). True -- the overall taste may not offend some but people not used to this much starchy carb overload may do well to stay away. 

As far as our experience -- we sadly won't be back to sample the $4.50 biscuits or the comfort food -- Martha Stewart's endorsements notwithstanding.",0,0,0

My friend recommended this place so even though I am on expense account and can get away with the 50 buck dinner places I thought I'd give this a try.  

I ordered one of the nightly specials, the 'lamb chop hash'.  First, the server brought a giant honey covered biscuit with a side of butter.  You have to eat this with a fork and you really don't need the butter.  The biscuit would have been a tad dry if not for the honey, but it worked and I ate most of it.  Which was probably a mistake, because soon after a gigantic skillet with enough food for three people arrived.  In this skillet was a generous serving of delicious, fluffy scrambled eggs that did not taste like they were over milked but were fluffy on their own, some delicious garlicky green beans, some cooked carrot slices, sliced red and orange bell pepper, a metric buttload of roasted potato chunks and four lamb chops. With a sprig of rosemary.    Holy guacamole*!  (*there was no guacamole)

I sort of made a dent - I ate all the lamb chops (great), all the green beans (great), all the eggs (great), a good amount of the peppers, a few of the carrots and a couple bites of potato.

Ironically enough the potatoes were the weakest part.  I'd like them cut smaller and crispier.  But heck, everything else was good and there was WAY too much food.

This dinner was $18.99+tax.  A very, very good deal for the strip and it tasted pretty good too.  Honestly I'd prefer a smaller portion since I hate wasting food and most people on the strip won't have a way to deal with leftovers.  But, if you come with a companion who likes to eat the same food, you could easily share one of these if you asked for an extra plate.",0,0,0

And then it arrived wrong.

Grilled cheese without bacon (it automatically comes on), and side salad with red onion.
Yeah, I know how difficult this is.

And it arrived cold.
I tried to deal with it because it was sort of a biz lunch. 
I removed the bacon, but the thing barely has any ""cheese"" and I use quotation marks because in all my 40 years, I've never experience cheddar cheese of this texture.

I swear it was squeeze cheese.
It was like a  spread.

No server to be found to take my food back.
Had to go to host stand twice and get assertive to get help.

Manager finally comes over and after I recite my very easy order to him and ask for a replacement, he asks if I want the tomatoes. Seriously I can't take it. Cheese sandwich with no bacon.  Never mentioned the tomatoes.

The best part about this meal was definitely the portion size. We ended up only getting 3 meals between the 4 of us, and we still had leftovers! We ordered the classic 2 egg breakfast, the chicken fried steak and the sage chicken and waffles. 
The chicken fried steak was huge, and really well cooked and seasoned. The sausage gravy on the top was a highlight of the meal! 
In my opinion though the winner of best dish goes to the chicken and waffles! The breading on the chicken was very tasty and so crispy! The chicken breasts were tender and very juicy, but slightly underseasoned without the breading. The bacon waffles were the perfect complement to the chicken.
The price I feel is pretty accurate for the amount of food, and the location.

My poor significant other wasn't so lucky. She suffers from a severe Gluten allergy and we both scoured over the normal menu (no gluten free f menu yet) looking for all possible options that would avoid cross contamination. After settling on a corn been hash and eggs, and quizzing the waitress on all ingredients, she assured us that the kitchen has made gf dishes before and we had nothing to worry about.

It's literally 3 meals for me, no joke! I've also tried the blueberry flapjack. The flapjack is the size of a pizza!! It tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. Something else I've tried is their French toast. They should rename this ""French bricks"" because that's the size of these toasts!! I also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! So yummy!

On our way back home, we decided to stop by Hash House for a Sunday brunch. I already had eyed the menu online and had a good idea of what I wanted. I ordered the avocado, bacon, onion and cheese scramble (option #1 under Scrambles) per the suggestion of the waiter. 

When the dish arrived, the food was presented nicely on a huge plate. There was a generous serving of mashes potatoes, a biscuit and the scrambled eggs. The potatoes were very rich (read: full of cream and butter) and not hot at all. The biscuit was good but would've been better served warm. Now, the ""star"" of the plate - the eggs.

I hated the eggs with a passion. I took a few bites and I couldn't even any more. All I could taste was oil mixed with more butter mixed with cheese that was COLD. It wasn't seasoned at ALL and was basically a greasy puddle of room temperature oily eggs with bits of bacon. There was no texture in the eggs and it just tasted soggy and disgusting. *GROSS*

I paid way too much for a plate of oily, under seasoned food that was NOT EVEN WARM AT ALL.

+1 star for the zero wait time but maybe we should've just dealt with the long wait and gone to the Sahara location since I heard that place has better food.",2,0,0

Good Drinks.

Andy's Special Benedict was lovely! By far my favorite thing that we ordered. We did have to search for the egg cause there were so many other things on the dish. But seriously - this is a Benedict on crack! You are going to want it again. 

The Hash Original was awesome as well. Jalapenos with chili and potatoes (which I normally am not a fan of) was delicious! Came with a yummy biscuit and fruit! Such a good dish and actually manageable portions relative to the other orders. 

French toast with bananas and pecans: lovely french toast! The bananas came with the peel still on...could've done without that one, but the dish was still pretty awesome!

BLT Bloody Mary was good only because it came with a mini sandwich bar: large bacon slice, lettuce in the drink, and toast with Mayo packet. Nice snack when you are starving and your meal is going to take 30 minutes to get to the table. The drink itself wasn't that great. I wish it was spicier and less watered down. 

I won't even ding the waiter for being rude and annoyed at our changing orders. We had every right to change the order once we saw how much food was being served, but he could have been cool with it.

After returning to my room from a night out and realizing that I was STARVING, I decided to head down to the lobby around 4am and see what was open and order food to bring back to the room. I was thrilled to see that the restaurant was open 24hrs and was directed to the bar to place my take out order. The restaurant itself didn't seem super large but had a cool, comfortable and casual vibe. 

The late night menu wasn't extensive, but it had just what I was in the mood for...Steak & Eggs! For about $15, the special came with a boneless Rib-Eye steak, Scrambled Eggs, Mashed Potatoes & Biscuit. I also ordered an Orange Jc which came out to like $6! If I had known, I probably would've skipped the juice. The wait was a bit long for my order, but when it arrived I remembered to ask for butter & A-1 sauce for my steak before I returned to my room to dive into my food. 

Of course I wasn't expecting the plating to be as beautiful as the pictures I've seen for the regular dishes served in the restaurant (lol), but when I opened my take out container I was NOT expecting that much food!!! LOL The portions are HUGE! Two people could've easily shared the meal for sure. 

First of all, my steak was perfectly cooked, flavorful and SO delicious. The scrambled eggs were large, fluffy folds and were really good. The mashed potatotes were thick, well seasoned, tasty and could probably feed an army. And the best thing next to the steak was the biscuit. The biscuit was BIG! It was soft and slightly doughy in the middle (but in a good way!)...it was so perfect with the whipped butter! I was in heaven and really glad that no one could witness me eating this amazing meal in my hotel bed!

My only complaint is that some of the menu items were too complicated (I'm kind of picky). One of my friends had biscuits and gravy and the whole plate was smothered in gravy, even on top of his eggs. It was kind of strange.

That sage fried chicken will forever be in my dreams; unfortunately the service will always haunt my nightmares.  Two days in a row you guys failed.  Hard.  Telling us to come check on our table in 20-30 minutes because the buzzers don't work in the casino (why even give them out? If we aren't in the casino we are sitting right in front of your face, just call our name), then when we come back in exactly 19 minutes you have given away our table and proceed to sit three more parties in front of us.  Don't tell us we can go downstairs if you are going to give away our table.  Our waiter on this day was a little flighty; service was al little slow, but nothing too bad, 20% was earned. But day two taught us how bad it could be.  Our server started off with a little banter, a little personality is always nice, and was lacking the day before.  Then she was gone.  I had ordered a BLT Mary (which was delicious), and delivered to my table after about 10-15 minutes by someone else,  our server did appear when I had finished it to see if id like another.  I said no thank you, but some more water would be nice, and a dining companion asked for a re-fill on her diet coke.  The diet coke made it back, but no water.  Then another server brought out one of our four food orders.  A bit later two more orders, then the final.  Still no server and no water.  None of us got water until we were finished eating and finally flagged down a server from another table, and you can imagine how long that was with the size of their portions.  We waited about 10 more minutes, still thirsty, and finally asked a bus boy for water and a box.  He brought the water, thank god.  After another 10 minutes out server came back, we asked for her to get the box, she did.  We also asked for out check.  She gave us some flack about coupons, but finally got it done.

We ordered and the server was a really great guy. The food came so fast I didn't get a chance to think about it good. 

One entree is all you need the portions are heavy here! I shared two with my friend and we were stuffed like turkeys on thanksgiving! ordered the Andy's Sage fried chicken with maple reduction. It comes with bacon, mash potatoes, and 2 eggs. 

The chicken comes deep fried in a corn Flake batter its crispy and filleted so not bone to get in the way. Tender and juicy with just the right amount of golden crispy flavor. I had my eggs scrambled hard with cheese and they were perfect! With a little of the syrup in them. The eggs were all you could ask for eggs to be! But the potatoes OMG the potatoes were covered with crispy bacon with just a little maple syrup on top. They were mashed to perfection! The plate comes garnished with some caramel straws and orange two very fresh tomatoes and a melon wedge. Every thing was fresh and tasty .

The waffles and chicken is just as delicious. The same crispy chicken. With delicious waffles but the best part is when you bite inside... ITS BACON! This how a waffle should be! Tasty bacon with crispy waffle in every bite.

Tangerine mimosa was the recommended drink! Husband approved and had no complaint.

OMG!  I have to say that this was truly the best Chicken and waffles ever! The bacon was cooked inside the waffles. The sweet and salty taste literally made every bite a delight!!! The chicken portion was overwhelming but we polished it off!   I'm a salty eater. Needed to sprinkle but my husband said it was fine! Don't take my advice on this.  Only for salty eaters! The salmon Benedict was amazing. It had spicy kick that I promise made this entree a hit!  The salmon was embedded in biscuits, smashed potatoes and the creamy hollandaise.

I like this Hash House a go-go conveniently located on the Las Vegas Blvd strip on the second-floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. 

I like the bigger venue of this HH Las Vegas location with no wait in the morning. 

I like the later closing hours at 11pm.

There is a full-service bar. 

There is Keno and a big screen television for sporting events.  

But the food tasted like any other casino's diner. If not, worst than the San Diego's Hillcrest location. 

For $16.95, I had the Crispy Hammered Pork Tenderloin. The dish had a long piece of a crispy Pork cutlet on top of a biscuit, BBQ cream sauce, scrambled eggs, tomato and spinach. 

My meal: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FRWIO4KonJv9o279SsyKag

This is a very big dish, but the dish's taste-wise was just ok. Like I aforementioned, it tasted like an overpriced casino food. 

I also had $6.00 glass of Mimosa. At least, they used freshly squeezed OJ along with champagne in this drink.

Reasonable prices. Watched people receiving huge portions and many having to get to go boxes. We managed to finish our sandwiches but only about 1\/2 to 2\/3 of fries.

The portions are humongous, it's true. I ordered a benedict, and when it came out, I had no idea that it was mine. It looked like a monster! Probably because it was resting on a Mount Olympia model of mashed potatoes. Intimidation aside, it was yummy and hit the spot during an inebriated Vegas spell.

I got the sage chicken biscuits and gravy. It was enormous and really tasty. The best thing about it was the creamy sauce that I suppose was meant to be the gravy. The big biscuits are nice and fluffy inside. They were best with the homemade strawberry jam. 

The service was friendly but a little slow. Quite forgivable, since their s'mores mocha takes the server maybe 12 steps to make and seems to involve an acetylene torch.

A couple has chicken and waffles deposited before them. It has a huge steak knife impaled through the mountain of it. It appears they are pulling out their phones to bid their family members goodbye. Or to take pictures. They might not make it through this.

I can almost see him beyond the pile of meat hash deluxe-ness before him. I tell him I love him before we start in.

A few pathetic minutes later, we've done all we can. Lonzo knows the symptoms. Still, he refills my bottomless hand-squeezed lemonade, later providing a to-go cup when it becomes obvious I have no more stomach room to give. 

In my deliriously bursting state, I think back to an innocent time, before we placed our orders. To all of the things we had planned to do that day, the shops we would visit and the sights we were going to see. It had once seemed possible. Now we just want to live to see beyond our stomachs again. Every day it gets a little better.",4,9,4

After a long hard night for my liver, I had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). And even though the hangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. That being said, we  walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.

I only complain about the situation I was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. The corned beef sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. The cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. And the meat. So succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. The portions were well aligned with the price as this is no Dennys or Ihop. The price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. I could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. This hearty meal was just what I needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.

All in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. The only flaws I saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino. I'll recommend this place for a decently, delightful devouring during daddy's drinking day recovery.",1,0,0

I was a bit worried walking up to restaurant to see a crowd of people waiting to get seated. The good thing was that people were constantly leaving and people waiting were being seated. The wait was about 20 minutes. 
This place is known for their sage fried chicken, leeks, and waffles which goes for $15.99. The menu says it's a New York Times favorite. This dish comes with two crispy pieces of boneless chicken, fried leeks, and 4 pieces of thick waffles, and maple syrup. Waffles were a bit extra-ordinary such that they had whole pieces of bacon cooked inside of each one, however, I didn't care for it too much. I like my waffles a bit on the thinner side. It seemed as if I needed to drench my waffles to get some flavor in them. The bacon inside didn't enhance the flavor. The chicken on the other hand was pretty good. Not great but good. I was so hungry that I ate both pieces of chicken and 3 out of the 4 waffles. Trust me, those were big portions, but honestly, I'd rather have Roscoe's than Hash House A Go Go's chicken & waffles.

That's how big the pancakes are. The pancake was delicious. I didn't think it was worth $14 with a scrambled egg and 2 small sausage links. They do tell u that the portions are meant to be shared Bc it's so huge. I ordered the freshly squeezed tangerine juice off of the menu per the waiters recommendations. It was $6.50 and it taste just like the juice from the grocery store. It didn't taste like fresh OJ. The freshly squeezed tangerine juice tastes like it came from the dole container from the supermarket. I was expecting something freshly squeezed here.

1) drinking Fat Tuesdays before eating because I got full before the food even got to the table and also buzzed.  Plus the unhealthy amount of sugar in one of those is not very complementing to the oiliness of fried chicken.

2) ordering one chicken and waffles plate for yourself.  Everyone shared a plate with someone at the table except me and a friend who insisted we needed our own.  Once we got our plates we knew we were idiots.  There's so much chicken and waffle that I'm sure it could last three meals.

Regardless, the food was aesthetically pleasing.  The waffle was alright, nothing too special.  I think there was bacon in it which I'm personally not a fan of.  The chicken had maple syrup downed on it which I'm also not a fan of.  There's a fried leek too.

I wish I could give it a better review but there is so many problems with this place. It's a bummer because I live nearby and it's the only restaurant that is allowed to serve breakfast at the Rio.

The hours are terrible; It closes way to early even when conventions are going, and even during the wsop. 

The service is okay at the bar because the pretty red head and guy that run it most of the time do pretty good. Besides the bar the service has always been very lacking. 

Even with my diamond it took awhile to get seated the last two times I went. After seated it took well over 5 minutes, almost 10 just to get water. Another couple walked out and I wanted to follow them but was to hungry.

They are so bad at getting your eggs cooked to your request. If you order over easy, over medium, and over medium well they seem to all come out cooked the same, rushed out very runny and certainly over easy no matter what. They just don't try and rush to get thing on the plate.

I believe this place could be better but there is poor management for sure. They manager must treat employees poorly and only comes in to collect the money so it is ruining a place that could be so much better. 

They say your food is cooked to order but that is a flat out lie. They have your potatoes pre cooked, biscuits are cold and very bad tasting. It's huge but but so dry and very bland to match all the food. 

Portions are large but prices are way to high. Many things are not worth it while others are just a waste of food. Giving me a pile of pre-made, non seasoned potatoes does not impress me. I've tried many of the dishes, the meatloaf is probably the best but nothing special.

I will eat here again and will update or add to the review because I frequent the Rio often but I avoid this place and never order a drink when I go since it won't get refilled. 4 of us had empty waters for so long with no service, we could not get them refilled at all, even the 7yo drank all hers. The waitress just dropped the check dropped and ran off. 

I'd avoid this place if I were you.

It had been on my radar ever since I first saw it on Man v. Food. Staying at Imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. In a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, I didn't do that.

Before going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. Adam Richman's is one of them. 

I decided to do takeout for dinner. While it was very tempting to just get the popular sage fried chicken and waffles, I was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. Oh, that'd be one pound of meat. The entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.

The mushroom and Swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. Extremely juicy and gargantuan. Everything cooked perfectly. It was heaven just to see the melted Swiss and sauteed mushrooms. It's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. Two big dill pickle slices in the burger. While the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.

I'm guessing they used a brioche bun. Very soft and inviting. I personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. This just felt like the Juicy Lucy I had in Minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. I think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. Fork and knife might be required. I for one needed a larger mouth.

Burgers come with one side item of your choice. I got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. Great job on the crispy potatoes. It also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. The olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.

Dessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the bread pudding) are for in-house dining only. Might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that bread pudding.

Breakfast includes french toast, flapjacks, and the Fried Chicken Benedict, all featured on the Man v. Food episode. I hope to get back there for some of those dishes.

I saw the plating of the sage fried chicken and waffles I spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. Three or four waffles for the base, some fried chicken on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.

Even with all the inflated prices on the Vegas strip, I think it's well worth the price to come here. Check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.",7,22,7

I got one of the scrambles, which fortunately wasn't quite as big of a pile of food as some of the other options. The burgers, chicken & waffles, and really anything with fried chicken are giant towers of food. The pancake is the size of a steering wheel. My friend ordered the larger bowl of oatmeal thinking that surely they wouldn't give her a giant vat of oatmeal.... she received a giant vat of oatmeal. So, maybe just share a large entree with someone and get an extra side of toast or something. My scramble had smoked salmon and brie, so it was adequately decadent. I loved the GIANT biscuit that it comes with (get this instead of toast) as it was buttery, flaky, and everything you'd want in a biscuit. I ate about 75% of my plate but felt almost sick from overeating. Perhaps you have better self control than I do.

As much as I wanted to order a hash from the menu, I was steer toward the Benedicts by the waitstaff.  My first dish was the Fried Chicken Benedict.  For starters, I can't believe I was going to eat Fried Chicken for breakfast.  I am not from the South, so I have never even tried Chicken and Waffles.  The whole chicken for breakfast (when its not an egg) is a little odd for me.  Nevertheless, I ordered it.  When the dish came to the table, I exclaimed ""Holy S**t"".  The waiter said that is what everyone says.  The portion was super gigantic enormously big. This could really easily feed 2-3 people.  Once I got over the shock of how large my breakfast was, I decided I better get to business.  It was decorated with a large sprig of Rosemary and a few uncooked noodles.  The chicken was fried to perfection and has a flavorful coating that was classic fried chicken.  The whole thing was topped with a great Hollandaise type sauce with a bit of a spice to it.  Under the chicken was eggs, a biscuit and mashed potatoes.  The biscuit (excessively large) was buttery and flaky.  The mashed potatoes were a nice based to all of that bursting flavor of the chicken and sauce.  This was really a great dish.

Next time there, I stuck with the Benedict and tried the Salmon Benedict.  The presentation was similar to the Fried Chicken Benedict, except it was of course Salmon and decorated with asparagus.  Components were similar to the other Benedict, but I wasn't a big fan of the salmon.  I felt that it was overcooked.  As I was eating it, I wished I had ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict again.

I was just informed by a co-worker that Hash House a Go Go is a chain and in several cities.  I definately will try one of their other locations, because I need to try some hash.",7,2,4

The food and atmosphere are always amazing and so worth the wait (which is usually a lot less than they tell you, so eat a little bit before or bring a snack and you will be in your seat in no time!).This time I decided to get their fried chicken salad, as in all the years I had been here I've never had one of their salads, so I had to try! I asked the waitress if I could have more spinach than iceberg lettuce and she said ""sure'. When she brought out the salad of course it was huge and was meant for three people versus just one. I decided to tackle the salad like Adam on man vs. food; and of course food won. The salad came with a sweet and tangy mustard sauce, that I got on the side, and it was filled with greens, blue cheese, cherry red tomatoes, and a huge chicken breast that I cut up into small pieces and tossed in the salad. It came with one of their awesome and flaky biscuits on the side. I asked for jam and butter; and when I cut and bit into the warm biscuit with the jam and butter it just melted. I ended up taking most of the salad and half of the biscuit home--I am still eating on it! 

I would recommend Hash House A Go Go for anyone wanting great quality and quantity food at a great price. (my salad was only $14!) It is a Vegas staple and a fun place to check out! I definitely recommend sharing an entrée.",1,0,0

My first time here I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken (the Man vs. Food favorite), and I thought it was ok.  Nothing spectacular at all.  But my friends seemed to have enjoyed their meals a lot.  My friend is a Platinum member of Total Rewards so I didn't pay for this meal, hence nothing to complain about if you didn't pay for it I guess.  Plus we skipped the line, so I didn't have to wait.  I do need to note that the portion here are HUGE, so sharing entrees is an option here.   

This time around, however, I was extremely disappointed in the food.  I came here a second time to see if maybe the food I ate the first time around was a bad day, so I gave this place a second chance.  After this experience, I really think this place is over-rated, and I can't understand why it gets as crowded as it does.  The wait on this particular Saturday was 45 minutes to an hour.  We finally got sat, and we ended up ordering right away since we were all starving.  I kid you not, it took an hour for our food to come.  And our server, Alonzo, noticed this too because he came over TWICE to give us the status of our food.  The first time it was because the table next to us that came 10 minutes AFTER we did and didn't order right away got their food 30 minutes before we did.  Alonzo informed us it was because his manager accidentally  put the food ticket in front of everyone else's.  Ok, fine.  The second time he came around, he apologized for the food taking so long and that it would be coming up.  He must have read our minds both times because we were talking about how long the food was taking.  I know the food is made from scratch and all, but are you churning the butter and digging out the potatoes from the dirt back there too?  Shoot, an hour for eggs and potatoes is too damn long!  I found the service from Alonzo to be very professional and courteous despite the disappointment and delay of the food. 

When we finally got our meal, we were no longer hungry anymore.  The ham, spinach, and cheese scramble was alright, the country potatoes had this weird sour after taste that had such a bad taste in my mouth I didn't even want to finish them, and the crappy home-made biscuits tasted like hard chalk  No, it wasn't fluffy and buttery, but bland, hard, and completely devoid of taste.  I decided that this was definitely a 2 star Yelp experience.  I was so disgusted by the experience I actually felt the need to speak to Alonzo and the manager about how bad it was.  If the food had been good, the hour wait would have been worth it, but no, the wait was a complete waste of time.  While the portions are big, that just means big portions of more tasteless and bad food.    

Alonzo was completely understanding and offered to discount our bill for us.  He understood why we were upset at the experience and did not BS us. I asked him if we could speak to the manager.  This manager guy was less than professional and gave us bullcrap excuses for why everything took so long.  Hey man, your employee already told us you were the reason the guys next to us got their food 30 minutes before we did.  Secondly, I've been here once before and the food didn't take nearly half as long as it did this time around. Just take responsibility for your actions and be honest.  He gave us a 30% discount on our food, but I don't think this was enough to want to return to this over-rated restaurant or recommend anyone to even waste their time going.  I'll just take it as a loss.  However, it was enough to bump up it from a 2 star experience to a 2.5 star experience.   

Despite all this, I don't recommend anyone to go here for breakfast.  The wait is too long for tasteless food.  Las Vegas is renowned for their world-class food, and this place isn't it, people.",4,1,1

Hash House is a chain of some of the best traditional American food I've ever had. This is the stuff that you expect when you combine a gourmet chef with fresh farm ingredients.

The wait times can be a little bit crazy, especially if you come during regular meal hours, or if you don't have any priority pass (i.e. Diamond status) to speed through the line. But it's well worth it if you're hungry -- and it's a great spot for groups too! (Assuming they're okay with waiting.)

Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of ""twisted farm food"" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.
 
With late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because ""oh man, we thought this was a buffet.""  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.
 
Sitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was ""you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it"" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.
 
Arriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a ""dessert"" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.

Perhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - ""Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.""  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.

Our dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3\/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.

Settling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.

Only issue was that the chicken pot pie really needed salt and pepper and was a bit dry so we ordered extra sauce for it. The favorite of the table was my sage fried chicken, which I also of course had to take to go. The complimentary biscuits served are softball sized (maybe bigger) and come with this really good honey butter, we also got homemade strawberry jam. Everything was so rich and delicious that we all left uncomfortably full. So make sure to pace yourself!

I had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great.

My friend, had a egg dish and asked for whites... but they messed that one up too...

My other friend had the banana and brown sugar pancake, and it was marvelous! You don't even need the syrup!

The food was awesome overall.

The biscuits were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend noticed a little metal jar, next to the sugar, salt and pepper shakers, and discovered a wonderful blackberry chutney (jam) and it accompanied the biscuit wonderfully! Would've been nice if the waitress mentioned it...

The mashed potatos with skin were great as well, perfectly seasoned, we didn't have to add anything to it.

The sage chicken is OMG good, although I would probably go with the chicken and waffles next time, cause I think the sauce on the benny, although good, was overwhelming... maybe if they used half the amount, I would've ate the whole thing.

The amount of food they give you is like ""hungry man"" portions, and value, is well worth every penny! The only other complaint I have, other than the miscommunication between the order and chef was the feel of being hurried in a sense...
The portions are huge, so the group had about half of their dish left. Every 3 mins, it seemed one staff member or another lliked to come by and ask if we were done... let me tell, I was chewing my food still!!! also instead of asking us, if we wanted to-go boxes, they just took it away, when we said we were done... Now, perhaps it was our fault that we didnt say anything, but I thought it would've been courteous and nice to have been asked...

So, I would give this place 5 stars for the food, when they get it right, and minus 2 stars when they are off, and in this visit they were off.",0,0,0

However, allow me to explain (and yes, you know I will).

Last weekend HHAGG was one of our premier destinations, meaning, we absolutely HAD to get there no matter what it took.  We arrived at Imperial Palace around 10:30ish and figured we'd have to wait a while, so we put our name in and headed back downstairs to gamble.  Adorably handsome Host Guy told us it would take about 1-1.5 hours, so we figured if we came back around 11-1115, we'd be alright since the little buzzer things don't work in the casino proper.

Multiple drinks and gaming experiences later, we head back around 1115 only to discover that our names had been called already.  One of the other hostesses asked us to wait in an alcove closer to the actual restaurant itself, and while we were blocking it, we waited another 20 or so minutes.  By then we'd pored over the menus and made consensuses as to what we'd order.  The host desk seemed to keep forgetting us, though, so there was a number of ""reminding"" requests on our behalf.

We were seated and ordered our drinks -- I opted for the Bloody Maria, which was absolutely delicious, my bro ordered a Milwaukee's Best Premium for the novelty of it, and everybody else ordered regular stuff -- and off we were.

The food takes a looong time.  Don't come here starving (or super drunk as I was).  You'll see other patrons getting their food and your mood will just continuously sour.  No matter how upbeat you keep the conversation, eventually it will lull and you'll realize the food takes foreeeever.

Once our plates came out, they arrived at various times.  Snoop Melly Mel started on her Tractor's Platter with french toast and devoured it.  My bro Alvin D. opted for blueberry pecan pancakes, Alex A. chose the chorizo hash, and the bestie and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles and the crispy pork tenderloin benedict.

Now here's the catch -- the portions are well priced and definitely large.  Don't get me wrong.  But there were just small things here and there, particularly with the ""popular"" and more ""signature"" platters the bestie and I ordered.  The fried chicken is tasty but entirely too dry, as is the waffle.  The waffle is WAY too doughy and thick.  The bbq cream sauce on top of the pork tenderloin benedict is to DIE for, as is the well breaded and well seasoned meat itself.  The biscuit also is amazing.  But everything else on the platter somewhat faltered; somewhere underneath there lays spinach, tomato slices, and mashed potatoes that were essentially tasteless.

The best part of the plates was also the most skimped on -- come on, maple reduction?  You can afford to offer more of that than just a mere drizzle on the sides of each plate.  It was delicious, but SO scant, that we barely got to enjoy it.

Our server was kind, attentive and accurate enough, but bringing out each order seemed kind of scattered.  As per the usual, others bring out the food, but they never seemed sure as to which table their orders in hand belonged.  What's up with that?

HHAGG was definitely worth the first-time experience, even with the table mix-up.  But would I return?  Probably not to this one; I would maybe opt for the one at the M Resort just to save time.  A solid A-OK.",1,0,0

It's nice because you can have everyone try some of your food and still have plenty left over!!!

The bloody Mary's were good too! Came with two olives and a small pickle- could of used a little more spice but it was still yummy!

Sure, there were other people in there with us...but you could differentiate pretty easily between those that were just starting their night, just ending it, had just woken up, and those who obviously had no idea what time it was.

Chicken and waffles can be had for any meal of the day.  I chose it here for two reasons - the other reviews of the chicken and waffles, and the fact i've never had it before.  Yes, gasp, I know.

Well, this was the place to have it.  We split it and barely finished it.  The waffles were huge, and the chicken was all kinds of crispy.  Do you want extra syrup?  Yeah, you do.

We paired our split dinner with two specialty drinks, which absolutely hit the spot.  We were in and out in 25 minutes for less than $40.

 Pretty much everyone I know that has visited this restaurant either LOVES it or, like me, doesn't get what's to love about it.
 First, credit where it's due- fast, efficient, food comes out accurately and promptly and there's a LOT of it. Our party had almost 20 and was handled seamlessly. 
 Now the food- if you want an enormous heaping platter of completely tasteless breakfast fare- look no further. You have found just the place!
 The lack of taste is uniformed pretty much regardless of what you order, I've sampled my family's food on previous visit and stole a bite off co-worker's plate. The kitchen is very conservative with flavor and seasoning- not sure if they simply expect that patrons will douse everything with hot sauce and go to town with salt shaker, but there you have it. 
 Stuck to poached eggs, as I saw no reason to load up on bland calories. 
 You are really better off either cracking eggs into a skillet in your own kitchen or hitting up one of the myriad of coffee shops in this city.",1,1,1

It took thirty minutes for one order to come out and forty minutes to get a small side salad. Then three of us had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food while our other friend ate. The table next to us was having the same problem. When we asked the server who brought out the salad where our food was he told us it was not problem and to tell someone else.

Crab cakes $15
I thought I could finish crab cakes by myself but nope. Ended up dumping half of it on my sister's boyfriend's plate, a third of it on my friend's plate, and to-going the rest. It did get sickening after 15 minutes. 

Chicken Waffles $20
AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Crispy chicken that's so flavorful and dry, it was perfect by itself. The waffles were alright, they had slices of bacon in between. 

Steak and eggs $20: Requested medium rare but got well-done, no matter. Still delicious.

Hot chocolate $5.99
This could be a meal itself. Hands down the best hot chocolate I've ever had. Made from scratch, its a smooth drink with 4 large marshmallows drowning in the chocolate goodness. We ordered two of this for a table of four and still couldn't finish it.

Came around 9:30AM and there was a 15 minutes wait. Not too bad. Left around 10:47AM and  the crowd was alarmingly huge.

Food show.  The host visited the Hash House a Go Go on Sahara, and he tried the fried chicken eggs benedict.  My boyfriend was hooked--when we went to Las Vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.

Fortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the Imperial Palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  In order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  

The restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  There is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12.  The hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  

The atmosphere in this restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  It also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  It is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  Clearly this worked as no patrons I observed lingered over their ample meals.

Waitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  It took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and I think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  We also lacked silverware.

The food was pretty good.  The sizes definitely live up to the hype.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  The bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  The chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, the combination of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  The side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  

The best entree by far was the fried chicken eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  It was huge, layered with fried chicken, eggs, fried cheese, biscuits, and mashed potatoes, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  It was an amazing combination and a huge entree.

This is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return.",0,0,0

So we came later around 7 pm and there were maybe 3 other patrons. Which was great because we were on our way to a Vegas show after and we couldn't wait long.

Anyways I ordered a mojito, fried green tomatoes and we split the Chicken and Waffles.

The waiter was enthusiastic and I really liked him. I told him I didn't really enjoy the mojito and he was really cool about it. 

The fried green tomatoes were really beautifully delivered. They rate great too. But if I had a particular critique I'd say the batter the tomatoes in were flavorless and it kinda brought down the dish.

The wait to get my main entree was insane. Especially since there were only 3 other customers. I mean how long does it take to throw some chicken in a skillet and put some waffles in a waffle maker? Not 45 minutes.

After that, though, the service got a little spotty.  It took forever for our waitress to come to the table for the first time, we needed to ask for a lot of things twice in order to actually get them (like syrup, napkins, water, PLATES).  It was sort of frustrating in that respect.

But the FOOD.  Oh maaaaaan the food.  My husband and I couldn't decide what to get, so we decided to split three things.  Our waitress sort of tried to talk us out of it saying ""it's a lot of food, you know"".  I said that we were aware--we saw Man v Food.

But anyway, we got the french toast with a side of eggs over hard and bacon, the farmhouse scrambler (chicken and peppers mixed with eggs) and that comes with a biscuit and crispy potatoes.  The last thing we ordered was the Snickers pancake.  This was at LEAST a food wide (see picture).

Overall, the food was delicious!  The highlights of the meal for me were the Snickers pancake (of course)  This thing was SO fluffy!  It was like having more than one pancake stacked on top of another!  Also, the crispy potatoes were to die for--they had an amazing crunch.  I also really enjoyed the flavor of the french toast.  There was just a hint of banana without being overwhelming! 

 Seeing how my mouth was busy nomming on the snicker's pancake, my husband downed the bacon and eggs and said those were really good (why he chose the bacon and eggs over the deliciousness of the pancake, I will never know, but I was grateful!  More for me!

The farmhouse scrambler was just ""ok"".  It wasn't really a standout among the amazingness of the other dishes.  Maybe if I had ordered it somewhere near me where it wouldn't be in competition with other more spectacular selections, it would have fared far better.

We were seated and immediately greeted by a friendly server who took both our food & drink order. I suggest knowing what you want before sitting down. I ordered the chorizo hash thanks to the suggestion by our Uber driver, and my husband ordered the brown sugar & banana pancake. 

The portions are massive!! I loved mine, but after a while, my husband said his was a bit too sweet. But that's too be expected! The cold brew with vanilla was the best cold brew we have had! 

Overall, I'd come back and suggest it to friends. It was a wonderful experience, maybe just pack a snack to tide you over!",1,0,0

Let me tell you, this place doesn't screw around. The portion sizes are HUGE. The food\/$ ratio is off the charts here. For two of us, our bill came to $29. I had the bacon, avocado, cheese stuffed burger with cheddar bacon mashed potatoes. My fiancé had a mozzarella and red pepper stuff burger with mashed potatoes. Both meals were awesome and let me tell you, just ONE of those meals would have cost around $30 anywhere else on the Strip. Both meals came out steaming hot.

We have never tried this place before so we decided to come here early (I'm glad we came here early because there were so many people waiting by the time we left it was hard to squeeze ourselves out of there). The restaurant is located at the Linq hotel on the second floor (when we went they were doing construction so we couldn't find the entrance without asking someone where it was first). The wait was only about 7 minutes and when we sat down we were greeted by our server right away. He was super attentive and really nice and our food and drinks came out in no time.

I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my boyfriend ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower. Both meals were huge! We could of probably shared one! We dug in, and it was delicious. The crab was sweet and I like the fact they didn't scrimp on the amount of meat they gave you. The biscuits were soft and fluffy, but I couldn't eat it all because there was just so much food! I don't think I took more than two bites out of the mound of mashed potatoes under everything. My boyfriend ate all of his though (@ _@). I gave this place four stars because the food was overwhelming and even though I did enjoy my crab cakes, there was just so much of it! And the flavors of all that grease and fat were starting to really take its toll on me, internally.

After eating we kind of sat around for a bit and that's when I started to notice the smell of grease in the air. It was actually making me a tad sick after eating all of that food. As soon as we walked away though, the feeling I had in my stomach was gone and I was good.

I would probably go back and try other things though that are on the ""lighter side"". But this would not be the place to go if I had a hangover!",0,0,0

The other problem with hash house was the portions, they give you way too much on one trough sized plate, it's intimidating to see when it comes out, it makes you feel that every meal was an eating competition of it's own, no wonder man vs. food went there.

Anyone who has read other reviews I've posted knows I like one meal above all others, breakfast.  Though my trips to Indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the Hash House A Go-Go may be it's greatest export.  

We had large group, so I'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  Our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  She was also helpful in ordering.  If it's your first time there, I recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the Chicken Farm Benedict.  This colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  I went for the Tractor Driver Combo.  

The TDC was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, french toast or waffles.  This would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  Far from the ordinary, the pancakes, french toast and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  And, with flapjacks like Blueberry Pecan, Brown Sugar Banana, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Butterscotch Almond, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon french toast...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  

My choice was made slightly easier when I saw Brown Sugar banana pancakes.  I think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  This was a banana pancake on steroids!  It was incredible.  It was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  If I could have finished the one that I ordered, I would've contemplated ordering a second.  It was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  

Seriously, if you're in Vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  Book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said ""dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook.""  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet.

Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd.

It is much like the Hash House in San Diego with the exception of the casino\/smoke smell.

Got the crispy potatoes and fruit to go with. It was the perfect amount of food for two. :]

I had the sage fried chicken (2 breasts) which sat atop 4 bacon waffles, with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. The chicken breasts were crispy and juicy. The waffles were fluffy and had strips of bacon within the batter. Large portions- each entrée can easily feed 2.

With the same price we were able to get ourselves food from other restaurants that were much better quality and just enough in terms of quantity. We expected a nice and refreshing brunch, instead we got huge platters that were larger than Texas (yes they don't even serve this much in Texas). What really disappointed me was the service and the wait. Although it's understandable that getting late to any Vegas restaurants will most likely result in long wait, we did not expect 30 minutes of waiting for an available table, 10 minutes of waiting for the waiter come to get our order after we got our table, 40 minutes of waiting for food to come, and 20 more minutes for the waiter to handle our checkout, on top of that, our waiter did not even ask if we needed to refill our water ONCE (my glass was already empty by the time I got through 1\/4 of my platter).

Stayed at the Rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. This seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel\/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.

 If you want fried chicken, bacon waffles, bloody Marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.

My parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and I ordered the sun dried tomato, goat cheese, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.

In all honesty, I was starving so didn't realize a the stuff I missed until we got our to go order to the room.  First of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.

We all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  I didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.

Also I'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.

Lastly, the eggs. Had such high hopes for these. The scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? They were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of goat cheese.  Full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. 
Overall our breakfast was disappointing. Other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). All the staff members were so friendly and nice! The place was well decorated and very clean.

It is open 24 hours so you can opt for a very late dinner to avoid the crowds.
Call ahead and make reservations weekdays, no reservations on weekends.
While you wait check out their wall of stars. Pretty impressive the list of stars that have eaten here.
They have several TVs if you want to keep up with sports.

After waiting 10 mins, I decided to be a dare devil and just take a seat at the bar against the hostess' direction (no way in heck I was waiting 2hrs by myself). When I sat at the bar, I was immediately greeted by a bartender who directed me to the awesome tropical mimosa on the drink menu. The mimosa was pretty darn tasty and I eventually ordered a second. The menu was extensive so it was kinda difficult to make a decision on one of the many fantastical dishes to try. I finally opted for the hardwood bacon & avocado scramble.

I was stuck between the Chicken and Waffles and the Tractor Driver Combo.

The biscuits we were greeted with at the beginning of our meal was probably the best thing we ate all night.  I had the grilled chicken and my friend had the chicken and waffles.  As you'd expect, both portions were huge.  My grilled chicken had the best flavor out of both dishes and was solid.  Unfortunately, the chicken to vegetable ratio was very off and in 3 bites, I had consumed all the vegetables on my plate.  But then again, you're not going to HHAGG to eat healthy!

My friend's chicken and waffles was disappointing.  The waffles were boring and the chicken dry.  We were really expecting more from one of their signature dishes.

Firstly there's going to be a wait. Plan ahead. Seriously. Put your name in, walk the hotel, get coffee and come back. If you spend an hour and a half of your Vegas experience sitting in their waiting area.. You're doing it wrong.

Second thing.. Their portion sizes are huge.. Obviously. So if you were expecting to get your food 10 minutes after you sit down.. Maybe IHOP or Denny's is more your speed. 

I usually go with the Chicken and Waffles which is amazing, but I changed it up to the fried chicken Benedict, which was good- but the bulk of the meal comprised of their potatoes, which although tasty, become less tasty when there is legit 2lbs of them on your plate.

After hearing good reviews about HHAGG my wife and I took the cab ride to Linq.  After finding the restaurant we were taken back by amount of people in the waiting area versus the restaurant space.  They were about even in size.  We then where told it's a 45 minute wait. Which is fine for a good meal. 
No buzzer, nor text app, allowing you to go into the lounge and maybe gamble but what do I know. Just an invitation to straight up wait in the tight overcrowded lobby.  We went to the bar and got coffee.  

The bartenders\/servers were busy but our time at the bar allowed us to see that several tables were empty or not bussed yet and so the wait was now understandable.  
After an hour and 15 minutes. 
We were finally called to our table.  
Waited 5 minutes for attention but after our very nice waiter (who was also the very busy bartender) came over.   Our lobby exile allowed us to be prepared to order. So we did. I the Roasted chicken... My wife salmon skillet... 35 minutes later after little attention(got coffee no cream) and surveying the slow turn around in restaurant our food finally arrived.  

Pretty; but the other side of luke warm. Like it was sitting under a food lamp for 18 minutes. 

Crispy potatoes stood out, but everything else was rather average at best. It was disappointing; I earned exceptional.  
By the way; everyone RAVED about their coffee, let me tell you good not great.  
Look it seemed that there wasn't much management in the place and the space\/time wasn't maximized. My wife, who normally could care less, was looking for efficiency apps to share with the hostess. I say ""honey that all exists"". My wife hates clutter!  

Side note: After the meal, we had to walked the 2 flights of stairs because the escalator was out for over the now 2 1\/2 hour breakfast experience.

The food here is lost in all the layers of meat, veggies, sauces, and decorations. I think if the dishes were made more simple then I think it would have been fine. 

To be honest, classic and simple dishes like eggs Benedict or fried chicken & waffles were lost in the clutter of food put onto this one plate. Now, don't get me wrong, the food here is decent but in terms of flavor, it was lacking.

I tried the Andy Sage's Fried Chicken Benedict which is like a unconventional version of biscuit and gravy mixed with eggs Benedict. The portion is huge and reads to be a delicious dish on the menu, but in actuality, there's nothing spectacular about it. Like previously mentioned, a lot going on. The chicken was a little bland but at least it was moist, the hollandaise sauce was too thick and bland, the biscuits were fine, and the mashed potatoes were average. I'd rate this dish 3\/5. 

The take on chicken & waffles here was close, but no cigar. I thought the waffle was good (although a bit heavy) and I especially enjoyed the thick bacon that was cooked into the waffle -- a great combination of sweet and savory. As for the fried chicken, it was appetizing, but not lacking in bold flavors that a fried chicken should have. I'd rate this one 3.5\/5.

Upon being seated, took 8 minutes to be greeted and asked for drinks. Water was all that I was interested in and it was never refilled for the entirety of my visit. The infamous sage-fried chicken salad was my choice for the night, and it simply reinforced  why I don't order salads at most restaurants. For $14, I was not only unimpressed but pretty let down considering it was a go-to item on the menu. To note: salads are huge at this place; but that is to be expected when the salad is solely composed of chopped iceberg, CHEAP. The remainder of toppings included grape tomatoes, blue cheese, and pecans. For a serving bowl-sized salad, 4 grape tomatoes is hardly noticeable and the pecans were so chopped that they were unrecognizable. The crumbled blue cheese was an adequate amount. Now to the chicken. Sage is a strong herb so it should be identifiable fairly easily, it was not. The chicken, in fact, had no taste and was clearly made MUCH earlier in the day then left to sit, so that there was a weird gummy layer in between the skin and meat. This was surely old chicken that was thrown under the broiler to heat up. With all of this, a weirdly tangy dressing is served, actually tossed in the salad, and good thing I opted for it on the side instead because its mildly inedible. There were only 3 other options for salad dressing, STRANGE, but the cucumber ranch wasn't too bad. The worst part of this effortless salad entree were the numerous cores of lettuce I found. I picked 3 while eating it and i was only able to eat half the salad, so not sure if there were more. One core of iceberg head is 1 too many, and 3 is just careless.  I tried washing down this mess with water but i had to do it conservatively because the server never returned after i asked for a different salad dressing. In fact, when she did return much later, it was to give us the check, when we hadn't requested it, and no dessert was offered.

I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entrée looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.

Find Hash House A Go Go at The Quad (where the Imperial Palace would have been) Heavy construction work is underway so don't be surprised if you find yourself navigating a labyrinth of a path to get here. (Apparently, renovation\/alteration is not done yet!) 

Family Tuesday cannot happen this week with schoolwork (and everything in between) piling up for me so I convinced my parents to follow our adventurous compass and head here today. When we got to the first floor, I scanned the celebrity guests whose signatures lined menus in the waiting room outside the restaurant and saw a picture of Adam Richman from Man vs. Food taking a shot at the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower! Sold. We agreed to share what sounded like a mutated chicken and waffle combo. And we were right. It was ginormous! That and an extra order of Basic on the side which included 2 sunny side ups, ham, 2 wheat bread with butter and diced potatoes and I was charged with all the necessary carbs that lasted me for the whole day. My parents were too stuffed to elaborate about their meal by the time we were done, but I'm assuming they had a blast. American portions still get pretty overwhelming for us (and to think that we were already sharing our orders)

Papa couldn't help commenting that the fried chicken was just the right level of crispy and mommy loved how the waffles had bacon stuffed in it. I would hop here for breakfast more often if only the construction below wasn't as disruptive as it was. Over the course of our meal, we heard someone drilling beneath the floor of the party next to us. We could literally feel the ground shake and servers were shaking their heads in frustration. Thankfully everyone was taking it with a grain of salt and light-hearted humor (Someone joked that they thought it was their baby making all the noise) 5 stars without the noise.

Mark & Jayson were the bartenders on duty. Both guys are awesome!! They were very friendly and very attentive to their diners at the bar. So I had the meatloaf hash and it was very good.

Went around 10:30 p.m. The restaurant was relatively empty. We were immediately seated. Our waitress was delightful. She even brought us both our own biscuits enshrined in honey butter--they were complimentary!!

I ordered the HH Twisted burger #2 with fries. The burger was just okay, but needed some seasoning and the spicy\/cheesy profile was not great. The fries were good.

My man ordered the chorizo hash with eggs and fruit garnish. He was not a fan, as their potatoes are not very good or flavorful--the focus is more on herbs than salt. 

Overall, I think I would come back and try other popular items. As it stands, not the best food in Vegas or the Strip, but a cheap eatery with massive portions.",2,2,0

Having heard about the chicken and waffles, I had no choice... starting with their house salad with a cucumber ranch, I was a little full when the platter of four waffles and two chicken breasts arrived.  Though not a huge fan of waffles in the first place, these babies were cakey and fluffy, and each held a strip of bacon. Not yo mama's Eggo.  The chicken was hot, crispy and flavorful, without a huge amount of breading.  Two waffles and one chicken breast would have been plenty.

We tried the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, a HH ginormous blue berry pancake and a pistachio ice mocha.  Okay first off, the portions are huge!  One pancake is probably enough for at least three people.  My benedict was gigantic as well but consisting of: mashed potatoes, biscuits, tomatoes, mozzarella, scrambled eggs, fried chicken and a pink country gravy the flavor combination was a little too muddled for my liking.  I can easily see the Sage Chicken and Waffle stack as being much better.  The pancake itself was tasty but it was so huge it was on the dry side also they need to serve this thing with a pitcher of syrup and lots of butter instead of the single scoop and tiny cup it came with.

My pistachio ice mocha was very good and even better after I stirred up the whipped cream to add some additional sweetness to the drink.  I could definately taste pistachio!

Yes, I still believe the prices are outrageously expensive, but the food was crafted so well, and the service was very good, that I'm just gonna give them the 5 stars. I've eaten at a bunch of buffets at Vegas, and I thought that was the best food they have to offer. I know this isn't an original Vegas joint (the original's in SD, and it's majorly lackluster), but my experience here has convinced me to try different restaurants on The Strip.

My parents, sister and hubby (then boyfriend at the time) and I all went to Vegas for a quick getaway mini vacay.  We stumbled upon this place and although there was a wait, the food on the menu looked too good to pass up. 

When we were finally seated, a young guy was our server and he did a tremendous job. I can't remember his name, but he really did try hard to give us good service. He even ran around looking for pineapple juice for my dad's drink, even though that's not even on the menu as a drink option. Very weird, that my dad would order it, but the guy found it. 

So the vibe of the place, isn't like the original location in SD which is very modern farm-to-table vibe. This feels a little more rock & roll-ish with all the bright lights and decor that you can kinda tell it's at a casino. We waited a bit for the food but when it finally came, we weren't disappointed. Jacob and I split the waffle with eggs and bacon. It was pretty standard. Good syrup, the butter was buttery and the waffle was just a decent Belgian waffle. No complaints since it was huge. My sister's waffle was ginormous yet delicious. I think there was banana in it. And although it was very very good, it was so difficult to finish and we were eating it for a snack later that day and breakfast the next day too. The third dish was the one my parents split and everyone kept picking at. Although it was absolutely huge, we finished that up completely. I'd ordered this at SD but it was so much better here.


For the dish that everyone kept picking at, the hollandaise was divine. I could swim in a tub of that creamy goodness, and the egg contributed to adding creaminess to the dish. The hash browns were crispy and starchy. the chicken was crunchy and juicy. There were colorful peppers and green onion on top to add color and freshness to the dish. And it was all tied together by the yummy, filling biscuit. I had to stop myself a few times from eating everything because this was my parents' dish after all. 

I'm super inspired to try a different dish here, next time I come to Vegas, or at least try a new restaurant by the huge variety of places they have here. Until next time!",2,1,1

My wife and I shared a breakfast platter and there was more than enough for both of us.  There had to have been at least 4 eggs in the scramble that we got.  The biscuit was huge  and there was ample home fries. 

We got a side salad to share also as we have not been eating our fruits and veggies but the cucumber ranch dressing with the cheesy pollenta croutons was phenomenal!  The croutons were so good that we got a side order of them.  They were cheesy, soft in the middle but had a nice crunch to it.

A lot. My wife, daughter and I had brunch here on Saturday afternoon. The food here is what they call ""twisted farm food"". It really is a good description of what they serve. It's high quality food that is creatively and well prepared. 
      The restaurant itself is busy and bustling 24 hours a day. Decorated in a farmhouse motif, the staff is constantly moving in and out of the kitchen delivering plates of very large portions of food. 
       Our server, Erik was friendly and accommodating. We perused the large and varied brunch menu while he brought our drinks. The menu has some really good sounding dishes. The signature dish here is the sage fried chicken tower. It consists of 2 large fried chicken breasts sitting on top of 3 homemade waffles. I saw a lot of people having it and it looks...really good. Maybe next time on that one. 
        We each chose one of the ""scrambles"". I had the smoked salmon scramble with mashed potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The scramble itself was good but not out of this world. Nothing I couldn't make in my own kitchen. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Probably the best Iv'e had. The biscuit is huge and has a hint of rosemary and also a large spring of rosemary sticking out of the top. It was excellent as well. My wife and daughter had basically the same thing except they had different ingredients in their scrambles and my wife had crispy potatoes instead of mashed. We all liked our dishes very much. 
        On this Saturday afternoon, this place looked like the place to go to cure a hangover. More than a few people looked like they were in pretty bad shape.
       This location is the only one that is open 24\/7\/365.  I can definitely see putting Hash House A Go Go on our regular rotation. I can't wait to return to try the sage fried chicken or one of the Benedicts.

This time around, I had the chicken and waffles and it was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and I ordered our own separate portions but thankfully (and ironically=P), the waiter forgot one of our orders so we only had 1 order of the chicken and waffles and skipped out on the omelette plate. The portion was perfect and our chicken was cooked to perfection!

1.) Right when we started eating, a drunk lady made her way outside and threw up in her hand and then on the floor. Yes, I know this isn't Hash Houses fault but it still was disgusting.
2.) The restaurant itself is ugly and dirty looking.

4.) There are a bunch of tables but they wouldn't let our party of 8 sit at our preferred tables because ""no one is assigned to that area"". All 8 of us were then sat at 2 small circular tables that were pushed together- and yes, it was VERY crowded.

I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and I've got to say, it's a massive portion of food! This is probably the most well known item on the menu, and for good reason.

All of the food from the crispy juicy friend chicken, the waffles and the syrup was great. This could probably feed 2 people. I was pretty hungry and I had about 3 pieces of chicken to bring home. It's also not incredibly expensive either so that's a good thing after a long night of gambling.

I will probably come here again on my next time to Vegas, but I won't make the mistake of ordering it just for myself.

I also got the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade with Vodka. It was very refreshing and I love how they snipped a piece of watermelon on the side. The color was very appetizing too.

Came in for breakfast before our flight home and as expected there was a wait for tables but only about ten minutes, not too bad, just a bit nerve wracking when one has a deadline.
First, the good: The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable and knew the products, when the food arrived the portions were generous to say the least. The meals were delivered quickly and correctly even though we had asked for a few changes. Our waitress, Bree, was smart, funny and was able to offer good recommendations.
The not as good: The food is only so-so. Portion size does not make up for meals that are haphazardly prepared. The waffles and French toast were neither crispy or especially tasty. The signature fried chicken was expertly cooked (very juicy and tender) but without the skin lacked any flavor of any kind, it would have benefitted greatly from brining, although I realize that this may not be possible for a high volume restaurant. The bacon was well cooked but suffered from what must have been a long hold time. It had lost its crispiness and had moved more towards leather which added a strange flavor.
Bottom line: I would return if for no other reason than it was a decent value in a city that doesn't always deliver on that promise as well as to try a few more selections.",3,0,1

Yelp led us here and we were not disappointed! It was early so we were able to walk right in! No wait!  Bf got the spicy chicken sandwich (he doesn't care for breakfast) brother got ""the basic"" and I got the tractor driver combo! All
Were delish!!! My pancake was larger than my head! And was so good!! I just got basic buttermilk it was pancake perfection! We will definitely come back. I knocked off one star because I ordered scrambled eggs with my meal and they were scrambled to death...I like my eggs hard scrambled anyway but this was over and beyond a hard scramble...brother had over easy eggs and they looked cooked to perfection so maybe I'll go over easy next time. But I'm more than happy with this place! I will definitely say it was pretty packed when we were leaving so if you're going and don't want to wait 9-915 was perfect!

We started off with BLT Bloody Marys which were awesome!  I had to order the chicken and waffles since the display always looks so ridiculous in everyone's pictures.

The chicken had these spears of rosemary(?) on top or was it sage, I couldn't tell, really.  I thought the chicken was lacking some flavor and slightly leaning on the dry side.  The waffles were OK, but I did like the idea of having strips of bacon in the waffles...pour the syrup and it's all downhill from there.  Banana pancakes were not bad, but not great either.  It just seemed like a regular pancake mix with some bananas mixed in...not really impressed. My friend barely made a dent in the eggs benedict - way too much food.

So when I was looking for brunch places in Vegas, and saw that it was conveniently located down the strip, I told my friends and family we were going there for brunch.

We arrived for a late brunch on a Saturday. At about 2:00 probably. And it looked like there was a long wait, but in fact the queue went by quite quickly. In fact, our friends weren't there yet, so we had to tell them that we weren't ready to be seated. However, since we waited quite awhile for them, we were first in the queue when they did come, so we got seated fairly quickly after they arrived.

The service is a bit hectic, but our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered Bloody Marys all around, and I opted for the BLT Mary. It comes with toast and a packet of mayonaiise and you get to build your own mini BLT with the garnish. Fun and tasty! Not the best Bloody Mary around, but big and strong enough to get the job done.

I had the sage chicken benedict and it was really incredible. The other half ordered the chorizo hash and it was also really tasty. Just a lot of food. A lot. Like none of us finished our meals. But that's okay. It's not incredibly expensive for the food you get, and they weren't really in a rush to get us out so we got to chill out and have a good time.

Our friends who are Vegas veterans (they live close by so get out here quite a bit) were impressed with my choice as they really enjoyed their lunch. I'd definitely come back and go to other locations. Maybe try something else. But their benedicts are so good, it would be hard for me to choose something else.",0,0,1

Chego in Los Angeles is my favorite restaurant in the world for this reason, and what it does for Korean food, Hash House A Go Go does for breakfast staples.

Take whatever it is you enjoy for breakfast. They have a fresh twist on it that adds lots more flavor, and they give you a gigantic portion too. I got the corned beef hash - it came out with larger chunks of quality corned beef (instead of mushed together scraps), with swiss cheese to make it a combination of the usual breakfast staple with a Reuben twist. My wife got the Pecan blueberry pancake, and said it was the best pancake she's ever had.

Highest recommendation to go. I find it hard to believe a human being could walk away from here unhappy. One tip though - this location is at the Imperial Palace, so we went because it was on the strip. But if you have a car, or the means to get off the strip, go to another location if you can. The Imperial Palace is one of the more crowded, smoky, noisy, run down and depressing hotels you'll visit.

This place is immensely popular. It is located at the back of the casino in Imperial Palace. Just go up the escalator. The food is wonderfully prepared with huge portions of mouthwatering goodness. 

Stick to the breakfast items. You'll be glad you did. This is what they are known for and they do it well, but not very fast. They create their dishes fresh. They make everything in their own kitchen. 

Not only is the wait time long, but the kitchen is slow. They prepare everything fresh and they get easily backed up. Half the staff are veterans from other locations and the other half are newbies with little experience. The food is worth the wait. This location has only been open for about two months and the kitchen is not as fast as the Sahara location, this is why there are empty tables.

There is very little difference on the menu between the location on Sahara and this location. I've not been to the one in San Diego before. If you are not prepared for long wait times and slow service then you will be unhappy like all the negative reviews.

In a city filled with mountainous buffets and chef-endorsed eateries, sometimes what you really need is a place that serves hearty, down to earth grub. And that is pretty much what you get at Hash House a Go Go. 

I had the fried chicken benedict and it was a monsterous plate of fried goodness. At first, I noticed a huge load of mashed potatoes underneath everything else which made me a little cautious (didn't want to food coma before going on the 5 hour drive back to LA). But surprisingly, the mash was rather light and went really really well with the rest of the dish. My chicken was cooked and fried perfectly with just enough batter for a nice little crunch. The bacon was a nice touch and the sauce they used brought the entire dish together. Overall, the flavors were very harmonious but truthfully, the most amazing aspect is the power of this meal to cure hangovers\/ aggravated stomachs. Be it a night of cavalier partying or a low key drink fest, the food here will do more than enough to stop the room from spinning. 

Just be ready to wait a bit and make sure all of your party is present when you put your name down because they won't give you a buzzer until everyone is there. There will definitely be a wait but they have a selection of magazines for you to dive into, assuming you're in a state to read. 

I will say that our waiter was rather rude at times and didn't seem too keen on earning his tip that day. One of my friends was very hungover and in obvious discomfort but the waiter still seemed to think it was necessary to poke constant fun at him; obviously he was joking (I hope) but there's a point where jokes get old and the waiter needs to learn when to stop. Maybe he realized we were getting annoyed because he disappeared for a while and left us to tend to our empty glasses of ice. I don't think it's enough to justify docking any stars but it's worth mentioning.

And those pancakes seemed almost an inch thick and was almost as large as the plate it was served on. They offer different flavors, like pumpkin! 

Customer service was excellent. We were in and out with no problem. Our server, forgot his name, was such a character made the whole experience even better than what we'd expected. The price is reasonable for the amount of food.

Considering I had just eatan at a Xmas party maybe an hour ahead then unknowingly demolished a whole plate here the food has to be good. I'll definitely be back. Maybe they'll take that Groupon I bought a few years back for a location that closed at M casino.",5,1,7

My co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my Yelp friends.  The family and I arrived at noontime on a Saturday where we were met by a long wait. We waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their PA system until it seemed close to our turn.  When it seemed close to our turn, I had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  Tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and I in the back corner of the restaurant.

We sat there perusing the menu.  Google Hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that I needed order their Corned Beef Hash and their Chicken and waffles.  We were all ready to order.  Missing was our waiter.  We kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  We didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  Then I saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and I heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  We were already seated for 20 minutes.  We needed to go home, back to Los Angeles.  So, I flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  After a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  It wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  Too late...your manager had already taken our order.  

The food was good.  The portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  The Corned Beef Hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, corned beef on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  It was good.  Even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  The Chicken and waffles was impressive.  The fried chicken came in a tower held in place by a knife. The chicken was flavorful and moist.  It was a winner.

The nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  Like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  The waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  Good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  I might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up.",12,10,11

They say that they are famous for their buttermilk sage fried chicken, so we wanted to try it. The chicken breasts had multiple chunks of fat on them, which is just gross when you bite into them. So, they can't be bothered to trim the chicken before frying it? The biscuits that came with the meal were dry and tasteless, even though they were covered in melted butter and honey.

We arrived shortly after 9A and were seated within 15 minutes. (party of 6) We had an awesome waiter, by the name of Moses. He was very friendly and extremely patient with us as we bombarded him with assorted questions. He answered each one with a smile : ) 

I think any of the breakfast entrees could easily serve 2 maybe even 3.  However, being the gluttons we are, we each ordered our own entree so we could sample a little of everything. 

Hubby had the chicken and waffles, 2 large chicken breasts and 4 waffles. The only negative is that I prefer dark meat, but the chicken was moist.  I had the corn beef scramble, corn beef shredded on top of a bed of potatoes and topped with melted cheese along with 2 eggs and a biscuit. (YUMM.......) One friend decided to attempt the Man vs. Food creation, I think it was called Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. This one could have easily served 4! A bed of potatoes topped with biscuits, eggs, fried chicken, tomatoes and spinach (?) and then topped with a chipotle cream sauce. OMG!  Another friend ordered the Tractor Driver combo(?). I seem to recall sausage and eggs and french toast and a grilled banana and .........  By this point, I was so overwhelmed that I can't remember what the rest of the gang had.

This place has been a staple for my yearly trip to Defcon for at least 5 years. It is located on the strip in the LINQ casino, right smack dab in the middle of the casino. At one time the casino was called the imperial palace which was a lot more weathered than the casino it is now. But I liked it because it is centrally located sitting in between classic Flamingo and Harrah's Casinos. 

Now for the food, making your way up the escalator you will start smelling that made to order food that comes out of that place. Hash House a Go Go is one of the best restaurants I have been to ever and I have 5 years of experience to base that off of. Even after a casino re-branding they have managed to keep the food to the top quality i have come to expect. 

When you eat here, expect to leave VERY full, although the menu prices are modest with $15-20 meals, the portions are quite healthy. So if you had breakfast you may want to share. Before I start talking about the many dishes I enjoy here, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about the coffee. They have a serious cafe in this place, if you have a traditional espresso look no further. And for you adventurous types, try the Smores Mocha, its huge and has a layer of marshmallow over it! If cinnamon is more your flavor when I had the Cinnamon Capp, I was in heaven. Not a coffee drinker? Well how about a nice tall BLT Bloody Mary, they put bacon and lettuce in this thing and serve you a side of toast. That's right you can take them out and you have yourself a drink... and a BLT!

Now for the food.

I am going to start off with my favorite dish and most likely this will be yours too, Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. For less than $20 you can have a feast of perfectly fried chicken towered (and I mean literally, towered) over huge Belgian waffles filled with bacon. I can never finish this meal so it end up breakfast the next day. This meal comes in a tower with a steak knife and skewer to hold it up. The plate is beautifully decorated (must like all their plates) with peppers and sauces. The presentation is always there with Hash House, I wonder what type of dish washer they have because it gets put to use! 

The other meal I have here is the 18oz Rib-eye which is bone-in and sitting on a mound of pumpkin mashed potatoes, I didnt know what that was until I got this. I still really dont know what it is but it tastes delicious! This meal is a must for the Steak eaters out there. 

The venue as I mentioned before is up an escalators in the middle of the LINQ casino. It is open 24\/7 but gets really busy during regular meal times. I would suggest coming in the off hours. Also there is no bathroom upstairs so, be sure to go before you head there or you will be walking around the casino trying to find one.",4,2,3

We ended up at this place because we were trying to get to the other location near Main Street, but the GPS took us for a twist.

As soon as we got there, we were hooked.  In the entryway, they had Bloody Mary's that you could purchase and drink while you waited for your table.  The place was packed, but a VERY GOOD bloody mary while you wait makes the line a heck of a lot shorter!

Once we got in, I ordered the Pistachio Mocha and she ordered the Smores Latte--both delicious and exactly what we were looking for.  The mocha was iced and very sweet--just the way I like it.  The flavor was good and the chocolate didn't drown out the pistachio--I don't think I could have asked for anything better!  The latte was hot and slightly less sweet--just the way she likes it.

For the meal we ordered the veggie skillet thing (mushrooms, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, potatoes, spinach).  I can't remember what it was called, but it was by far the healthiest thing on the menu.  The portion size was large and it was great to see them load up the veggies and not just inundate the skillet with potatoes like other places tend to do to cut on costs.

As a second dish, we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  I have had chicken and waffles, but this was by far the best I have had.  First off, the chicken was deboned--which means you just cut into it and eat--no need to chomp through cartilage or cut around bones to get to the meat.  Second, the batter wasn't too thick or excessive and complemented the chicken perfectly.  Third, the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY--probably brine-soaked before they deep fried it because it was plump, juicy, and pretty much just a perfect piece of chicken.  Lastly, the waffle was cooked well, and right in the middle of each piece of waffle was a few slices of bacon, which was an awesome surprise to an already great meal.

In the end, there was no room for dessert, but by that time, I was sold on this place and can't wait to get back here to eat again!

I've eaten here twice and both times I was completely shocked by the amount of food on my plate.  The first time I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The thing that came out was the size of the plate.  Not an ordinary sized plate either.  A freaking mammoth sized plate.  The tiny bun that accompanied the pork was laughable.  A knife and fork are required for eating this thing.  The pork is covered in ketchup which was kind of odd for me.  I ordered the Kokomo on my second visit.

I have been to the standard places and there are the fast food joints, but I have always been a little stuck for brunch because I'm not a huge buffet person. 

Well, look no further, mid-strip patrons! I have found the answer. So, I have to say that I was a bit intimidated by the wait (there seemed to be 50+ people standing around) but they said 25 mins for 2, so we figured that's ok. My second turn off was the ""Pancake house"" loudspeaker system which they yell your name when your table is ready. I don't know. Just not my favorite thing. 

However, look past the crowd, and the loudspeaker and you will be pleasantly surprised by the food. The portions are huge. If you have a fridge in your room, bring them back for your 2am hunger. 

I ordered the Hash House Meatloaf, spinach, roasted peppers and smoked mozzarella hash. Amazing. The meatloaf was perfectly seasoned - not too sweet, not too salty, and good consistency, and the spinach, peppers and mozzarealla made it amazing. The portion - like I said, was huge. I would definitely get it again, but with the menu selection, there is so much to try that I might be tempted by something else as well. 

So overall, try it out! I will be back. It's worth the wait.",0,0,0

As we waited for our food, we watched other plates coming from the kitchen and the fear set in. Then our order came and I nearly cried for my friend. My plate was big (but a hungry man could probably polish it off) but her plate was easily two days worth! 

Usually a place with ridiculous portions has okay food, but they manage to still put together a stellar meal. The fried chicken has a great corn flake coating with good crunch, the mashed potatoes are a little chunky like I like, some thick cut bacon for good measure, and the most perfect biscuit I've ever had. This biscuit was so good and our wonderful waiter saw how much I was enjoying it and offered to bring some of their house made strawberry jam which really put me over the moon. My friends plate had basically double of everything on my plate plus it was coated in cheese and some chipotle sauce that really was atrocity and not for the faint of heart. I would recommend sticking to their regular fried chicken plate.

Although most large quantity places don't have the greatest food, I think HH is slightly better than most large quantity type places. I'd give it 3 stars if it didn't make me sick to think about it...",0,0,0

I have to say within that gimmick Hash House A Go Go executes excellently.

I stopped by for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The wait was pretty long (45 minutes to get seated and another 45 to get our food) but we were given an accurate wait time and warned about the wait for breakfast when seated so I felt okay with the wait.

I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo with a Snickers flapjack. The Snickers flapjack is a frisbee sized buttermilk flapjack with pieces of Snickers thrown right into the pancake. As the food arrived I could see the little Snickers craters throughout the pancake. Again, this is a gimmick, a candy bar baked into a pancake, c'mon! But I'll have to say, I thought it was delicious. Enough to think I should keep a Snickers bar in my pantry for all my pancake adventures.

Is this the greatest restaurant of all time? Nope, but if you're in for the gimmick of big food that's over the top in its presentation, Hash House A Go Go will definitely deliver. I was also impressed by the Bloody Mary that my friend ordered that had a strip of bacon in it and was served with a side of toast. Truly a brunch appetizer as much as it was a drink.",2,1,2

A wee bit hard to find as it is on the 2nd floor, I sat at the bar. Peering at my neighbours gargantuan plates of food, I knew I made the right choice.

What quickly arrived after ordering was a daunting steak knife holding together this frankenstein creation. Also stabbing through the chicken was what looked like a rosemary tree. Geebus.

Chicken was flavourful and juicy, waffles could've been crispier but the bacon integration made up for that.

I hate wasting food, but I just couldn't swallow the carb overload.

We dined in with 2 other couples after speed drinking in one of the pods at the high roller. Lol. They needed to sober up before the drive home and recommended this would be the spot.

While the food is not cheap eats, it's certainly more than you can eat unless you're a big eater...no seriously...like a big eater. 1 plate can easily be shareable between 2 people if you just want something to eat without being too stuffed and are trying to be budget conscious. I was wowed at every dish passing by us, and the dishes placed before us.

I'll be honest, it was late at night so I just got my usual Caesar salad. It was a small side order and that was 7.99. While I was hoping for the price they'd hook it up, but since it was the side Caesar salad, obviously not. Most importantly, it was certainly one of the better Caesar salads I've had in a restaurant! Thoroughly enjoyed it and my fatassness aside, it really was a good side dish portion.

The husband ordered their meatloaf. We don't even eat meatloaf, but it read of something he wanted to try. Two thick stacks of meatloaf with mashed potatoes in between...which btw, their mashed potatoes were so dang deelish! I've never had cheese broiled over mashed potatoes, or at least that's what I think was broiled over it...lol...and that made me look at mashed potatoes in a whole new world. Anyway, I took a bite of the hubs meatloaf and couldn't really tell you how good it was because I don't have anything to compare it against so I thought it was alright. But...the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes...even better!!!! It also is plated with steamed carrot sticks and green beans which I ate off. Those were cook fairly good as well. Carrots just had too much black pepper for my liking.

But honestly, that biscuit with syrup or honey or combo of both or whatever that sticky madness drizzled over it they serve to you before anything else comes out....is why you should try this spot out to begin with! Giant biscuits cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth yumness. 

We didn't try their famous waffles and chicken, but we did see it go by and there is no denying that hash house a go go...is a go. Everything is clearly made to make you walk out of there with the ambition to run 3 miles, 200 situps, and 50 pushups or whatever it is your athletic side desires.

Our serve PJ was soooooo awesome and I wish he could be our server everywhere because he made our first time dining there fun. Hahahha. He has our kind of humor but never failing on his professionalism which is why I gave this particular place 5 stars. 

There are stairs and an escalator to get up there. I didn't notice an elevator, but I'm sure they have one.

We got there between 8 and 9 am, and were seated right away with a party of 3. If you have a larger party, or if you come after 9, be prepared to wait. When we left, there were plenty of people waiting, but the restaurant is huge so I don't think the wait was long. 
The menu is small enough to not overwhelm you, but big enough to where it is hard to decide on just one thing. I had been craving a BBBBLT, so that is what I had. It was GIGANTIC! Tons of bacon (hence the more than one B) on thick toasted white bread. It was perfection. Served with fries that were just ok, but the sandwich filled me up plenty. They don't have heat lamps in their kitchen, so the food came out right when it was ready. This could mean that your whole table won't get their food at the same time, so throw manners out the window and eat while your food is hot!
The portions are HUGE and the prices are way more reasonable than anything nearby for the quality of food. Plus, if you are a Total Rewards cardholder, you get a tiny bit of a discount!

She was able to suggest what would be best on how to order my avocado sandwich. 3 stars to the menu, not vegan friendly at all. My options were a salad or fries. 5 stars to the concept of their restaurants being Farm Fresh and scratch made daily, love it. Now, back to the meal. My boyfriend ordered the HH flapjack with blueberries and pecans cooked in it, with a side of mashed potatoes. I was jealous, I wanted that. I had ordered the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar burger minus the meet and cheese with extra avocado. It came with LTO and pickles. Portions were pretty big, with the flapjack being HUGE.  I've never seen one that big before, the size of a medium pizza! Mine was nothing to rave home about,  fresh avocado and plenty of it was great. The fries were some of the best ice ever had actually.  They had this crunchy seasoned exterior and soft inside, just yummy. Left me wanting to order a plate of them to go. My bf loved the flapjack, says it's the best he's ever had and we'll be back again, he's craving it. 

Their menu and food actually looks amazing, I'm sure it's all great, just not vegan friendly.

Hash House is inside Imperial Palace where I was staying for 3 days.  We had the pleasure of going twice.  The first day we had quite a long wait approximately an hour but once I received my food, I understood why.  The special that day was chicken and waffles and they were down to ONE waffle iron for the whole restaurant.  YIKES!

The setup of this place is pretty typical - nothing fancy but definitely clean and orderly.  The  portions are huge and the prices are surprisingly not a hard hit to your wallet.

First things first, Bloody Mary BLT.  It comes with toast, bacon, lettuce, tomato and deliciousness of a perfectly concocted Blood Mary drink.  It was a beautiful display and the BLT was a great appetizer to my hungry\/angry aka ""hangry"" tummy.  

Like I said, this day the food was very slow and they brought out our dishes one at a time.  We had four at our table and the first person was finished eating by the time the fourth received their food.  I ordered the corned beef and eggs.  It was actually corned beef and not hash - SCORE!  Deliciously flavored and hot at arrival.  My boyfriend and our friend ordered the chicken and waffles.  I tried a bite reluctantly and lets just say I do not like the combo, however, the professional chicken and waffle consumers at my table had rave reviews.  Our friend finished his plate so they brought him a signed menu congratulating him.  It is a big feat to clean your plate so they have a fun way of recognizing the big eater! 

Our 2nd time going to HHAGG, there was no wait.  The service was a delightful woman who was fast and extremely polite.  I ordered the chorizo\/eggs which was equally delicious as my first trip.

I ended up getting the sage fried chicken and waffles, my fiance ordered the Andy's fried chicken benedict and my dad got the cobb salad. Oh man, the portion of all the entrees were crazy.

I demolished my fiance's mash potatoes. I only could eat one waffle and one chicken...it was huge. The cobb salad was also huge, it probably could have fed a family of 5. 

After the meal, you definitely have to walk a couple miles to get rid of a piece of fried chicken. It was worth the $10-$15 an entree.

Obviously they are known for gigantic portions here, so definitely get a dish to split between two or even three people!

My boyfriend and I also got 2 mimosas and the total for our meal was $50. 

The next time we went (yes, in the same visit), we got Andy's benedict, which is a ridiculous behemoth of a dish that includes mashed potatoes, two biscuits, two fried chicken breasts, a thick blanket of crunchy cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream sauce.

The server we had on our first visit was awesome - super friendly, helpful, attentive and nice without being annoying or overbearing. He was also quick and we never had to ask him for anything. My boyfriend and I both commented that this guy is like the gold standard for servers.

Hash House has become a traditional stop for us every time we visit Las Vegas. We were first introduced to this restaurant from the television program, Man Versus Food. I now get the same thing every time I visit i.e. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.

The portions are huge so don't expect to finish everything by yourself (although, I make a valiant effort every time).

It was a whirlwind stay and I honestly didn't do or see very much.  I did get up a little early and had the desire to find myself the best breakfast, a breakfast away from all the commotion of the Strip.   So I asked Yelp for some guidance.  Typed in ""best breakfast""  Up popped Hash House A go-go. Nope in a Casino\/Hotel on the strip.  Try again... typed in ""best eggs""  again Hash House, again I wouldn't accept that.  It happened over and over, no matter what breakfast item I search up would pop this same damn restaurant!  Eventually I relinquished and took it as a sign.    Glad that I did. 

As I was walking out of my own Hotel (Luxor) I passed the breakfast restaurant with three people inside.   It was early, 8:40am.   Nobody gets up at that time of the morning in Vegas so I was golden to get a good table, or so I thought.   

I parked and did the 13 minute walk through the Casino to find the restaurant.   Things were pretty quiet.  Found the little staircase that take you up to Hash House and OMG there were at least 125 people all waiting in line!!!!  Damn, I wasn't going to have time. I realized then I might be on to something special.  Fortunately I found the counter with an empty seat, felt pretty smug.   The guy next to me was there for hangover food, boy did he seem to need it.   

The menu is extensive and everything looked wonderful.  I decided to order the Hash, they have quite a selection I went with the meatloaf hash.    As I was waiting for my food the people sitting around me started getting theirs.  First the guy three seats over.  He had chicken n waffles.  It was piled a foot high!  No exaggeration,  a freakin foot high!    Next the drunkie next to me... a massive plate of pancakes with plantains on it, kind of looked like bananas foster.  His GF had the Chicken Benedict, crap it was as big as the chicken and waffles plate.   Looked delicious too.   

When my skillet arrived it wasn't your Denny's skillet.  I was more like a Paul Bunyan skillet.   I took a photo but really should have set a medium sized palm tree next it for scale.   The meatloaf was excellent and I think with a great deal of effort I was able to eat about half.    

I am glad that I went and would most certainly go again.   I heard they have one or two other locations in Vegas so I would probably try to find something off of the strip though.",5,7,5

*The presentation looked great.

Negative: The taste 

*There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.

*The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  

*The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more.

You have to go down the escalators and turn right to get to the bathrooms in front of the purple zebra. 

Any ways. This place is busy. So come with an appetite. The portions are huge. Don't freak out from the large numbers of people waiting. The restaurant is very quick about seating people very efficiently and we only waited 10-15 minutes. It was great

Our server was Travis. He was awesome!! You can't miss him. He has a sort of Mohawk. It is awesome as well. Plus he was a great server and all his recommendations were SPOT ON.  Our coffee and water were refilled well. Our needs were fulfilled! 

My meal was the breakfast quesadilla with eggs potatoes and fresh jalapeños chopped. It's spicy and delicious especially with the sricha  chile sauce on top. My husband loved his meal too. We didn't finish our food. Not even half. Keep that in mind!

I spent 5 days in Las Vegas last week and I ate there twice, even with a rule that I wouldn't eat at the same place more than once. There are way too many great things I can say about this establishment, so I'll stick to my favorites:

-- The obscure, one-of-a-kind menu: They don't just do chicken and waffles, they do Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. They don't just do a hash or a scramble, they put together a work of art with fried chicken, bacon, hash browns, cheese, eggs, lettuce and tomato on a plate with the most delicious gravy sauce you'd ever taste on a big ole plate.
-- The service: Every waiter and waitress is trained to LOVE what they do. Either that, or they literally cherish their craft. They are psyched to be your waiter and to get you your food as fast as possible.
-- No heat lamps: When food is finished, it's brought out to your table immediately. They don't wait for everyone's food to be prepared and then bring it out and 1 or 2 dishes are cooler. It should be done this way at every restaurant.
-- Artwork: Across the restaurant, celebrities has signed menus and given them feedback about how perfect their menu is. And those celebrities are right.

This is a restaurant in which the food speaks for itself. Man Vs. Food's Adam Richman recently visited and showed how perfect this institution is. It's almost unbelievable how food can have this much flavor. My girlfriend's pancake was as big as a large pizza and tasted like it was injected with flavor. Just the best.

She was a super nice server. Gave us recommendations for drinks and always had a smile on our face. Delightful. 
Although, we did wait for our food for about 40 minutes ... Or maybe an hour... And I read some reviews where they said they can take up to 30 mins to bring out your food.. So we waited Patiently. Til we saw other people ordering seconds and actually got theirs before us.. So that's when we go ... Wtf....
So Kendra comes to us and told us that she was gonna go check on our food . Then she comes out and told us that our food was already done 20 mins ago.. And it was just sitting there ... Again..... WTFFF.... 
And she apologized and told us that the manager or kitchen manager is going to come out personally and bring us our food.
He came out with our hot plates and apologized and gave us one of our dishes for free . Thank you kind sir.

Sage fried chicken and Benedict (3\/5)
- the eggs weren't Benedict like at all. It's more like scrambled . There wasn't enough sauce for all that meat ! The mash was alright. The portions are hugeeeee. It's only famous for the size. Tasting wise... It's so so.. 


Sage fried chicken and waffles (3\/5)
- same as above for taste of chicken. The meat wasn't dried. And instead of mash, there were waffles. I didn't try the waffle though.",1,1,2

In the spring of 2012 I went to my cousin's bachelor party in San Diego. Prior to that I had only written one Yelp review. Since the San Diego trip was going to be pretty expensive, due to the itinerary, I decided to write Yelp reviews of the places that I visited. At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.

Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken. Despite its crunchy skin the breast meat was slightly dry. Overall I liked the dish because you get what you pay for due to the huge portions. Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets.",9,5,8

After hearing that the portions here were pretty generous, we were hesitant about whether to order two separate dishes or split one between the two of us. 
We ended up ordering Andy's Sage Fried Chicken ($14.99), a plate that contained all of the food groups I can think of. A delicious concoction of crispy, double-fried chicken with their delicious hash browns, a kick of chipotle with a biscuit, this plate can be easily shared by a very hungry couple.
The service was fantastic - our server Billy was sincere, funny and attentive, showing us what true American hospitality is about.
I highly recommended this gem of a brunch spot if you're in Vegas - skip the pricey hotel buffet and get a fresh and delicious dish here. The coffee is small at $3 here, but it's super fresh with bottomless refills.",0,0,0

Came here on Monday night 6\/11\/12 around 10PM.  There are 4 of us here, friend asks for table of 6, the rude black woman tells us that you need to have half your party here in order to be seated.  We tell her that 4 is obviously greater than half of 6, instead she just gave us a table of 4.

The last 2 people come and explain that they'd like to be seated next to our group since she wasn't able to accommodate a table of 6, even though there were plenty of seats.  She looks at them as if they spoke to her in another language, and then tells them to show her where they'd like to be seated, which is obviously next to our table.  Friend goes and points out an empty spot and she says ""well you're still going to have to wait.""  5 minutes later we are finally seated at the same spot that was unoccupied the whole time.

Mildford Fried Chicken Sandwich($13): it was huge! I could barely eat half of the sandwich and my sister couldn't even eat it at all. It was just too much food for the both of us.

Went over on a Sunday and place was packed, waited approximately 30-45 minutes to be  seated which is perfectly fine as it is a famous place (thanks Adam!) on the Strip. I should have googled more and found the other ones off the strip in order to be able to get a location with perhaps less people.

Anyway, after the long wait we were seated and waited 10-20 minutes for a server to show up. Ordered and was told the meal was going to take a while (which it did) but it would have been nice to at least get the Pepsi I ordered (never did) however it was charged.

Though the place was packed I expected a bit more attention from the server than just come take the order, drop off order, drop check, take check...yes, she came in and asked as usual if ""everything is ok?"" but it seemed like the attention was not there...perhaps too few servers in a crowded weekend.

As far as the food...it was good quality, and the value was there. Ran out of ketchup but server was not around to ask for more....and seriously, who charges for ranch?

The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. 

The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were ""normal"" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken.

As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Came here late one night with a couple friends after a show. We were tired, hungry, and staying upstairs at the LINQ so we decided to stop by for a quick late night bite. When I first walked in, I kind of expected it to be like any other basic American-style food diner. Sort of like Denny's. However, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the atypical diner food options they offered! 

We all got the BBBLT (a take on the BLT but with extra bacon). It comes with a side of choice. My boyfriend and I shared the plate with a side of salad. The salad was alright- they didn't have many choices for dressings. The sandwich was HUGE and it did come with a nice serving size of bacon but I wouldn't call it 3x the amount of a usual BLT. The bacon was cooked incredibly well! Tasty and crunchy. 

I can't really say much else about the meal without being repetitive. But I wish we could've stopped by one last time before we checked out! 

The service was very good. The host was welcoming and sat us quickly. He also came by with our drinks and refills on water. The server was friendly and attentive. I don't have much else to say based off of just one experience. Just come by and try it for yourself!!",0,0,0

Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - It's like egg's benedict, but with juicy buttermilk fried chicken breast with a nice herb seasoning. You'll find bacon, a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, scrambled cheesy eggs, an english muffin, some dried pasta sticks? and a stick of rosemary garnish all smothered in gravy. This stuff is your cardiologists' worst nightmare but tastes great.

Saw some other people order the pancakes here and I couldn't help but laugh at how large the flapjacks were.

We ate once for breakfast and once for lunch - FYI the menus change for each.   Portions are HUGE, Food was great., Wait wasn't long.  Customer service the first time we went (breakfast around 11am) sucked.  The place wasn't that busy - maybe 5 other tables and 4 other waiters\/waitresses but our waiter took forever to even stop by to introduce himself.  Drinks took awhile to get to us as did the food after we ordered.  Worst part about it was who I'm assuming was the manager had the staff that was just literally standing around clean the booths and not just touch ups but actually removing the seats and cleaning under.  This would be great if they didn't have to do it at the booths all around our table.  Call me crazy but dust and dirt and old food particles flying in the air as I'm eating isn't that appealing to me!  Luckily the food was awesome and I was starving so I was able to eat fast.  The second time we went our waiter was on point.  Nice younger guy who greeted us promptly,  offered to go over the menu with us, and even made recommendations - which didn't disappoint.  The hostess this time was quite rude though.  She had seated our table one seat short so we grabbed a chair from the empty table behind us.  Well this didn't float with her as when she came back around she told us that she needed that chair and that we needed to grab one from another table, one w\/ opened slats on the back.  Umm ok why?! ?! And why not be a little nicer when  you say this to paying customers?!  Luckily again our waiter saved the day and made light of the situation w\/ a joke about matching chairs.  Again the food was great so all in all we left happy.  I rate this place 5 stars on the food and 3 stars on the customer service (all thanks to our second experience w\/ the waiter) so I averaged it out at 4 stars.",0,0,0

Although if you were to eat all of it, you would definitely not be so comfortable! 

The food is, to cut right to the chase, not very good. So if you're looking to just eat because you're hungry and would eat anything so long as its food - then go here.

I had the cornbeef hash. I've never had it like this before (REAL meat). The biscuit it came with was so buttery, fluffy on the inside, and the right amount of crispy on the outside.
They also have different flavored mimosas (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, apple, tangerine...) I had the pineapple and tangerine. Tangerine wasn't any different than a regular mimosa, but the pineapple was delicious.

I had the sage fried chicken benedict. The chicken was definitely tasty and I think the best part about the whole dish. Otherwise, it was a gluttonous pile of potatoes, biscuit, and sauce (I could've done with less sauce for sure). 

The bad part of my experience? The place is popular, so we waited about 45min to get seated. That wasn't so bad since we were expecting the place to be packed. We already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. 45 minutes later.... nothing. We read reviews saying it took a while to make stuff, but after a while we started getting suspicious... and then we watched several parties that were seated well after us get their food before us. When we finally caught the eye of our server and asked about our food, she went to check on it. The food came out a few minutes later. Explanation? Something like ""perfection takes time."" I don't think so. Not after we watched multiple parties that came in after us get their massive platters of food while we waited.

So kitchens lose orders sometimes... but I think our server should've noticed and checked on it if it was taking longer than usual.

THEY HAVE NO RANCH ... they had no RANCH!!!! :( I wanted to dip the fries in ranch !!! GAHHH hahah they gave me cucumber ranch?... which wasn't so bad but... didn't beat ranch.

My friend ordered the smoked Applewood bacon hamburger I was too full to try hers but looked heavenly with the bacon in between the patty and the bun! She also ordered the tangerine mimosa but..that was definitely not a good choice...

Other buddy of mine decided to order the sage fried chicken benedict. The presentation of the dish is very unappealing but the taste is the total opposite of what It looks like. There's so many flavors in one bite but it's complimentary with each other!

The aesthetics of every plate is amazing, however I find it unpractical and more or less of a disturbance to eat around (or figure out of how eat).   

I wanted to try this place out for quite some time now, especially since a ton of my facebook friend's have been checking in and promising how delicious their chicken and waffles are so on my last day in Vegas I decided to make a detour to the airport and grab myself a brunch with a well needed bloody marry. 

1.  Parking.  You're forced to park inside of the Quad Resort parking lot and if you have a large vehicle I'm pretty sure security will harass you to make you not park in their three story parking lot (They did that to my brother in law).

2.  It's a maze just to get to the restaurant.  Gotta walk through a hall way, go up a fancy elevator, then go into some corridor to get to another elevator, walk through a casino, walk up a flight of stairs and then boom, you've found waldo.  

3.  No bathrooms.  Nope.  No restrooms in the restaurant.  You've gotta manage your way down the stairs, across the casino, and walk through a little mini shopping strip just to get to the restrooms.  

4.  When I stopped by their filter in the water was down.  No complementary water, so you're forced to shell out the $3 for a bottle of water. And if you do decide to order that bottle of water, think nothing much of it 'cause it's more like an 8 oz. bottle.  No refills, just blow another $3.

5.  Ordered the chicken and waffles.  For some odd reason there was an over exaggerated amount of rosemary and onion spread throughout my plate.  The syrup was less than half filled in the small condiment cup and when I asked for another one (since I was sharing with my boyfriend), it took them 5 minutes to bring us another small cup of syrup.  By then, the chicken and waffle was cold.  Oh, weren't we supposed to have eating utensils too?  That took another 10 minutes to get that and an additional plate to eat with.  

6.  I found their bloody marry's to be quite delicious, however I didn't need the collectors cup (which I didn't know was at an additional fee...heck, I didn't even know that there was a regular plane jane bloody marry) so I ordered another one.  Took a long amount of time to get that second and when I asked the server to rinse out my ""collectors"" cup, he forgot to come back and get it rinsed for me so I had to ask again.

Maybe I just had an off the wall bad experience, maybe not?  But I'm pretty sure the next time I crave for chicken and waffles, I'll just buy a box of Krusteez and a small box of Popeyes chicken.",5,1,0

Unfortunately, I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the service was pretty bad. 3 stars for their great menu with unique offerings (lots of breakfast items), huge portions, and ample seating. 

Value: since their portions are hugenormous, you can understand why they charge so much. However, $5.99 for hot chocolate, it's a bit overpriced. 

Taste: I only ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender meat inside- great! The taste- well, it's just ok. It can have a bit more flavor. The waffle is bacon infused. And since bacon makes everything better, I had no complaints there. The chicken is a bit over battered for my liking... Leaving fried batter all over the plate so on top of the thick bacon waffles, you have all this breading from the chicken--- carbs anyone???

Service: here's why i deducted 2 points... The bf ordered espresso... Accidentally, upon setting the cup on the table, the server spilled the espresso on the table, my seat, pants, and sleeves. We all know how small an espresso is so with half of it gone, he barely had any. You would think he would offer to replace it, nope! Fine. We realized our server clearly do not care about beverage because we already had our food and the water never came. Tending to our hydration needs seemed such an abhorrent task for him. The server gave no apologies, no f*ck, nor two sh!ts

Unfortunately, this loud, windowless, and fluorescent lit eatery focuses on quantity over quality. Their potions are so ridiculously huge that guests photograph their plates before they dive in. What they soon discover is that most dishes lack much flavor  - IHOP's buttermilk pancakes for half the $8.99 price are a thousand times better. I'd guess that 33-50% of every dish gets thrown out.

This restaurant also prides itself on being guest-unfriendly by refusing to substitute anything in their dishes. For example, if you don't eat pork and prefer their chicken sausage in your egg dish, they're more than happy to leave the pork out of the $13.99 dish, but they'll charge you an additional $5.99 to replace it with chicken sausage. WTF?

If you like to think that big portions equal value, customer service is overrated, and bad lighting and noise make for a festive dining environment, then by all means join the others here who agree!

I also love the location at the LINQ as you can walk around before or after you eat. One downside is the wait is fairly long but like I said being in a casino you can walk around while you wait. 

My second complaint is if you have to use the bathroom you have to go all the way outside the restaurant and use the ones in the casino. But otherwise nothing else to complain of.

When we inquired why the server was letting another party ahead of ours, instead of checking the list, they became increasingly argumentative and verbally combative. Instead of entertaining the idea that we might have been correct in our objections to being bumped down the list by a group of hoochie-looking girls, the servers told us to calm down because ""everyone will eventually get seated."" They eventually agreed to seat us and literally threw the menus at us. When we asked to speak to a manager, they became--again--more aggressive and resentful. The waiter said, in a shockingly sullen tone, ""Yeah, you want the manager? I'll get the manager."" We eventually realized we would neither be served nor see the manager when we saw the server idly chatting to someone around the corner.

Generally I go for the buffets on Sundays during my stays in Vegas but friends and I decided to try something different.  We all had Hash House in SD so decided to try out the Vegas strip location.

Two of us ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffles.  Yes it's as crazy as it sounds :]] Fried chicken and thick bacon waffles then topped with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. Sage on the chicken gives it such a different flavor and what better way to start the day than with fried chicken??  Bacon waffles are filling and the little bits of bacon is a nice smoky touch from the sweetness of the waffles.  The maple reduction and fried leeks are good just by itself. I can drink a gallon of the maple reduction and just eat a salad made of fried leeks.

The other two went for the Sage fried chicken benedict. Fried... chicken... benedict!  It comes with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. What a healthy way to start the day huh?

Hash House A Go Go is massive comfort(aka tasty, high calorie, butter, lard, sugar) restaurant inside the Imperial House on The Strip.  It is authentic with wood floors, basic tables, etc.  It emulates a roadside diner.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.

The menu is light on health, low calorie options and rather heavy on burgers, fried foods and other breakfesty type of foods.  I had the house cured salmon, healthy enough, until you place it over two biscuits, add gravy over a bed of mashed potatos(loaded with cream, I am betting)....It did have two pieces of asparagas.

Healthy...no...damn good...Yes.  

My friend had a burger.  It said burger on the menu, but it actually was a big piece of cow with a ton o' spuds.  Big.  Unhealthy. Burger

Because neither of us had the USDA requirement of sugar, we split the $7.95 Banana and brown sugar pancake.  Pancake was the size of the platter, just plain tasty.  When I have my heart seizure, they will be pulling this meal out of my veins

This was recommended by my friend's co-worker, like Raku (see: my other reviews), and I'd seen it featured on shows such as Man Vs. Food. It also seemed like Yelp liked it, so this place has a pretty good reputation. 

My friends and I arrived there probably at around 11 AM and we had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated, which wasn't bad at all. I was torn between getting the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Fried Chicken and Waffles. The benedict was listed as a ""Man Vs. Food Favorite"" while the chicken and waffle was listed as a ""NY Times Favorite"". Torn, like Natalie Imbruglia, I went with the benedict. 

My friend ordered a BLT Bloody Mary, and that thing looked almost like a meal in of itself. The gave my friend a crispy piece of toast next to a tall Bloody Mary with a strip of bacon standing up. When asked if it was good, his response was, ""It tasted like a Bloody Mary."" That's hard for a non-drinker for me to understand.

Looking around, we noticed that the portions were huge. The table next to us had ordered flapjacks and they looked like they were about to spill over the sides of the plate. When our food came, we were not disappointed with the portions, but rather, astonished by how big they were. The benedict not only comes with a huge fried chicken breast and a big biscuit split in half, but a large mound of mashed potatoes as well. Needless to say, I knew I would have a hard time finishing this and eventually gave up with still 1\/4 of the food on my plate. Flavor wise, the food was very good, though I felt the chicken was a bit dry. Also, once you get really full, everything starts tasting alike, so near the end, everything started tasting like death's sweet embrace to me. No one at our table finished their food.

Our server was super friendly and attentive despite the restaurant being super full. I'd like to try this place again for their Fried Chicken and Waffles, though it may be my last mistake if I try finishing it.

Perhaps the target clientele (extremely drunk people) are easily impressed with the theatrical food. On the other hand, anyone who values their time and money shouldn't bother.
We visited HHAGG at about 4:00 A.M. on a Saturday. We waited 15-20 minutes to be seated. We all ordered ASAP but the first wave of food took 35 minutes and the second took an additional 10-15 minutes. The entire time, people arriving and ordering after us received their food before we saw our waitress again. Also during this time, the ""security guard"" had nothing better to do than to wait for quiet, non-belligerent drunk people to look sleepy and wake them up. Ok sure, but what about the incredibly loud and annoying drunk people a booth over? Nope, they're fine, he'll leave them be.  The food finally arrived and looked impressive, especially for the price- huge portions, lots of color, etc. Disappointment was quick to follow.
What we ordered:
1. Swiss and mushroom burger (just ok, she was not impressed) and sweet potato fries (these were actually enjoyed)
2. Ham, egg, and cheddar burger (also just ok), french fries (crispy and pretty good) and a chocolate milk (just a large glass of milk with Hershey's sauce on the inside of the glass like some kind of ""deconstructed chocolate milk""; she spent 5 minutes scraping the chocolate from the sides and mixing it in)
3. Farm scrabble (which she enjoyed) with ""crispy"" potatoes (mushy, bland potatoes) and a biscuit (huge and tasted ok but had a shell hard enough to play hockey with)
4. ""The Basic"": eggs (which he liked) and the same gross potatoes and mediocre biscuit with a ridiculous sprig of rosemary sticking out the top

Tip: go at a weird\/off time (10:30am, 11am) because it will only be about a 20 minute wait. We went on a Sunday at like 10:45. When we left there was a HUGE line of people waiting for lunch.

ALSO text ""Vegas"" to 227466, and you will get Total Rewards offers - another reason we went here is because we got a BOGO for the Tractor Driver Combo, which comes with sausage\/potatoes\/bacon (your choice), pancake or waffle, and eggs. I also got ham on the side which was delicious. We upgraded to their specialty pancakes for $1 extra and they were HUGE. We finished about 1\/2 of that, each. All of the other food I saw people eating was ginormous too ... I think you can split portions but they do charge a small fee for doing that.

I would come back to Hash House next time I'm in Vegas! Kind of wish it wasn't at the Quad (aka Imperial Palace - lots of construction going on there right now, Jan. '13) but oh well. Only con was that the service was pretty slow, it took about 1\/2 an hour to get our food, but can't really beat $7 each for breakfast ($13.95 for the Tractor combo normally).",1,0,0

We order a few different items all of which I was told was great but I personally only tried one thing and that was the chicken Benedict. 

Sauce was on point, delicious 

Chicken was cooked perfect 

Bacon was cooked perfect

Mashed potatoes that everything sat on were perfect

Biscuits were fluffy yet flaky, another perfect 

Sausage gravy was great

All of these components when put together worked so well. This was one of the best breakfast\/lunch dishes I've ever had anywhere. 
I was literally eating so slow so that I could truly enjoy each flavor that made up this dish. 

The wait was over a hour but once I tried my first bite it was well worth it. 

This dish is big enough to feed 2-4 people depending on your appetite. There was 2 of us on this dish and when we were done it almost looked as if it could have been re served to someone else as a full meal. 
I'm very happy our waitress recommended this plate for us. We ordered something completely different and before it had made it to the chef we decided to ask our waitress if we made the right choice or if we should have ordered this and she was happy to make the change before it was too late.

I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  What was put before me was not a twist on a classic but a total insult to a classic.  A large portion of food was thrown on to a platter sized plate to make you say ""wow"" when you see it.  I did.  Partly because I thought I had received the wrong dish.  
Then I tried to eat it.  A dinner plate sized ""cracker crust"" that was about 90% inedible.  The crust had the texture of a medium\/hard jerky.  I couldn't even cut it with a knife and fork.  Seriously.  ""Cracker Jerky Crust"" might be more accurate.  At the bottom of the pile there was some mash that was just mash.  Slopped on top of that was the ""filling"" that was OK.  Lots of chicken but there better be for the price they charge.

We ordered a mimosa to start and it was smelly and tasted funky, but our waitress was hard to find and therefore we could not send it back.  

As a group of three, we ordered three different things so we could sample a good variety.  We had the chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, and a Mexican style egg scramble.  The presentation is amazing (We took pictures) and the portions are HUGE.  

Chicken and waffles- Waffles were good, chicken was crispy and juicy, but flavorless and rather disappointing.

Mexican Egg Scramble-  Decent eggs.  We put them in the provided tortilla and ate them like a burrito.  Potatoes had no flavor and we left most on the plate.

Chicken Pot Pie- Very nice presentation.  Do yourself a favor and just skip this dish.  Crust was as hard as a rock, veggies were hard to manage, and flavor was just OK.

Service-  Our waitress didn't really do a great job.  Service was slow, she forgot things we asked for like lemons and coffee refills, and the table was not bussed quickly AT ALL.

Ambience- The decor was not great, lighting was kind of weird (dark and bright at the same time), and many tables were left dirty for a long time despite the over-an-hour wait outside.

Post clubbing - late night the only hash plate they were serving was the corned beef one. The potatoes were a little dry and the egg seemed overcooked too. Was not impressed, but it was still a warm meal that hit my stomach real well with the drunchies I had. Would have given that experience a solid 2 because I'd never drag myself to go back there again with so many other great options on\/near the strip.

Late brunch - finally got the chance to take a stab at the whole menu and everything everyone ordered this time around was so much better! Definitely still feeling this place as more bang for your buck than my first choice brunch location, but the potatoes were great and everything was cooked way better than my last visit.  We ordered a few - HH meatloaf hash, chicken pot pie, and chorizo. Meatloaf hash definitely wouldn't order again as the meatloaf was very bland but the chorizo one was very nomzable.

Tried the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Tractor Breakfast, and Steak & Eggs. From those three, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was the winner. What brought down this rating was the customer service and the other two ordered items. Let me first start off with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. This dish was solid and plenty big. Consider sharing it. The fried chicken was very moist and tender. The crust on the chicken was sweet and very crispy. The waffles were toasty and crispy. Add some syrup and you're good to go. They put a lot of thought into this dish, so consider checking this place out simply for this one dish. 

I ordered the Tractor Breakfast with one stack, two over-medium eggs, and bacon. The pancake stack was extremely large. Again, consider sharing this dish if you're a light eater. I found the pancake to be too thick and dense. It's okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again. The over-medium eggs were cooked appropriately and the bacon was a bit too dry for my liking. Size wins, but food taste was mediocre.

The Steak and Eggs was a loser. Low quality beef and lots of unnecessary garnishes like tomato, oranges, and rosemary. Who care about garnishes when you're ordering steak and eggs? I found the steak to be dry and quality that you find at a dive diner. 

Customer service was spotty. It took forever to get our server's attention. Plus, she wasn't very informative on explaining what we ordered. 

In sum, diner experience with strip prices.",3,1,1

It's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (Our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.)

As for the food though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Chicken Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, a smoked salmon scramble and a chicken hash dish. The portions here are very large. Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.

The star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. 

Everything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it.

I was lured by the fact that Adam from Man Vs Food had come here and wanted to try it out! 

The location: Imperial Palace.. My first thought: REALLY?! Uff. But off we went!

Imperial Palace was going through major renovations.. The entire front section was closed off.. We had to park next door at Bill's? I think that's what it was called.. After nearly falling to my death by slipping on wet floors, we located the restaurant which was on the second floor. Once you go up there, it's like you're not even in Imperial Palace anymore! The restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that I just used that word, I know). The wait was about 20 minutes.. I'm not sure if they took reservations but we just walked in. 

I tried the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. OH MY GOODNESS. I was IN LOVE with this dish. When it came out, I swear I thought that I could probably only finish half (the portion was HUGE. It was the size of a small dog). But to my surprise.. I finished 80% of it. Shocking, I know. But you guys, this was so amazing. It was biscuit.. mashed potatoes.. scrambled eggs.. cheese.. fresh spinach.. fried chicken.. chipotle sauce.. OMG the goodness was overwhelming!

Our waiter Steve (aka Stevie which my daughter called him ) was so much fun. He was training a new waitress and she was very nice.  We loved the atmosphere and were very comfortable in the booth.

The children's menu had lots of choices and what does my daughter choose - Corn Flakes which arrived in a big white bowl with a huge strawberry almost the size of a plum - you should have seen my daughter's eyes open up.

I split the 1 pounder stuffed hamburger with bacon and avocado.  We were not charged a fee for us to share.  My husband ate the same thing but all to himself.

My cousin ordered the bacon stuffed waffles with chicken - it was huge and we just couldn't stop laughing about it.  Everything was delicious.

I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was huge, and the waffles had whole strips of bacon in it. Yes, whole strips! Sadly, those were the highlights. The chicken didn't have much seasoning, unless you count the rosemary skewer that held everything together. Rosemary's a really strong herb, and I tasted it in every bite. I wasn't crazy about the reduction, either.

Given that I was raised on Southern food, it was definitely not the best chicken I've ever had in terms of juiciness or flavor, and the waffle didn't really impress me either. I thought both were a little bit dry. I enjoyed the chorizo house hash more (topped with eggs), and the ""side"" of mashed potatoes was good. 

We ended up with enough food for four people, easily, and I thought the prices were very reasonable for Las Vegas. I was really curious about the mega-flapjacks, but that would have been a mistake. The wait time was very minimal even around 11:30 (prime brunch time!), perhaps 5-10 minutes.",1,1,0

When arrived at about 11 am after driving in from Los Angeles. This place was POPPIN. The wait was about 45 minutes so we went to the Irish Pub downstairs to grab a drink while we waited. We got seated at about the estimated wait they gave us. Kudos to the ladies working the waiting room. She was so energetic and they kept what is a mad house under control. 

Food: The Chicken and Waffles came in a huge plate that looked more like a mountain of food than anything. I split this with my girlfriend. The waffles had bacon cooked into it and it was bomb. The mix of the sweet syrup and salty bacon was fantastic! The chicken was perfect. Crispy, tender, flavorful! We also got a side of biscuits and gravy and that was delicious. The biscuit itself was OK, but the gravy was delicious!

My girlfriend got their watermelon cocktail and she loved it! I had a sip and it was very good. refreshing and not too sweet (which a lot of cocktail can be when they add the flavor syrup). It was so good she ordered on to go!

Service: Quick and friendly. They are pretty efficient here, but you have to be because they handle so many hungry people. 

Ambiance: Casual and busy. It was loud, but not overwhelming. Really cool decor. Enjoyed the vibe.

They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future.

I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. Hard to have leftovers on vacation though and I'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. Oh and the other guy at our table got the combo with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. The waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. Haha. Oh and I have to mention service was horrible. Our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time.

I decided to try the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES since their menus put soo much emphasis on it. I would be lying if i said i totally loved it.

When she told me she was taking us to restaurant in the Imperial Palace, I was definitely skeptical at first, but I've gotta hand it to her, my girl knows her way around delicious comfort food. But when she prepped me for the larger-than-life serving sizes at Hash House A Go Go, I didn't imagine a spectacle even close to the portions at this joint. ""A pancake bigger than your face,"" is what she said. And damn, the girl was not lying!

Since it was the afternoon on a weekday in Vegas, the place wasn't exactly busy. There were a few patrons though, and our waiter was nice and attentive. Being the foodies my friend, Christina and I are, our  eyes immediately darted to the New York Times recommended fried sage chicken and waffles - we know we were going to be ordering this. We decided to split since the portions are so big. Our other gal pal ordered a pecan pancake and some fancy flavored lemonade thing. 

The lemonade was quite tasty, and this takes a lot for me to admit because I'm not a fan of sour or lemonade at all. Next our food arrived...it was gigantic! Our chicken and waffles were stacked high - talk about a heart attack on a plate! it was a beautiful presentation, and the food did not disappoint. The chicken was nice and crispy, and I loved that we could taste the sage in every bite - a nice gourmet touch. The waffles were fluffy and did not get soggy when we poured the syrup all over this outlandish dish. And, to top it off, the waffles had a bit of bacon inside. I could have done without this because it was already so over the top, but it didn't hurt the dish. My friends pancake was indeed WAY bigger than her head. I had a bite, and it was a good pancake!

After a 45 minute wait, we ordered our food immediately because my husband had a poker tournament to make. Despite ordering right away and informing our waiter of our slight time crunch, my husband's food came in 45 minutes and mine in 55 minutes. By the time my food came, my hubby had to leave to make the tournament he signed up for... I ate my chicken and waffles alone. (To be fair, we probably should have known better than to come somewhere like this with a schedule to keep.)

In a nutshell, my problems with HH:
1) Average food. Chicken and waffles and corned beef were good but not great. Expensive for average food.
2) Poor customer service. Lots of staff running everywhere with little getting accomplished. While we were waiting, I was at the front bar to order a drink and had to interrupt a lipstick application gossip fest among the front staff to ask where the bartender had gone. Our waiter came by 3x to tell us our food was coming and it was still 15 minutes until the first dish came out. When I voiced my frustration about the wait for our food, it barely registered. No offer to make our experience better. Only a sheepish apology as our server ran off to run my credit card.

Initially, this was not my idea: my brothers girlfriend suggested it, so we all tagged along. Pleasantly surprised. 

1. Smores Mocha: Snooping through previous Yelp photos at HHAGG, I found this delicious mess of a concoction and decided to order it to share with everyone, which by the way was a great call because the mug was H U G E. The whole fam passed it around and we still didn't finish it. A sweet mocha beverage with a marshmallow topping, topped with a graham cracker, chocolate drizzle, and a dusting of cocoa powder.  

2. Bloody Maria: Alright, so the only reason this place got 4 stars is because of the Bloody. It was probably the worst Bloody I have ever had, in my life. No exaggeration. Reason being: it was over-doused in black pepper. Also it tasted more like ketchup than a Bloody. At first I thought it was just me, so I offered it to the rest of the family in case someone else wanted it so it wouldn't go to waste. Nope. 

3. Chicken Pot Pie: H U G E. We were not expecting the pot pie to be this large, it must have been enough to feed two people at the very least. Very cool presentation, the pie crust\/covering was tilted upward to reveal the delicious pie filling. Flavor deserves five stars, we took leftovers home and huddled around to snack. 

4. Sage Chicken & Waffles: Where do I even begin with this (similar thoughts when it was right in front of me)? A DISPLAY: bacon stuffed waffles stacked under a pyramid of delicious fried chicken with a side of maple syrup, topped with a few sprigs of sage. Again, this was yet another thing that was H U G E. Enough for two people... But only for me. The fried chicken was perfectly flavored with that hint of sage peeking through, however the waffles were a little much. I did not know that the bacon would be stuffed into the waffle (the menu did not specify), and I actually would have preferred it on the side! But I just pulled the piece out of the waffle and ate it without. Still delicious. 

5. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken: So, this is the Sage Chicken & Waffles, save waffles and add cheese + chipotle cream sauce + scrambled eggs. H U G E. Comes with a side of fruit. Delicious. 

They were also running a pretty cool special: show them your tattoo and they'll give you 25% off! Check. 

Would definitely come back, and maybe share some stuff the next time around ;)",2,1,0

I told him I woke up craving a waffle, scrambled eggs, hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. He put something together for me that included all those things but since they don't have hash browns I got country potatoes. Everything was Excellent!!!

I kept seeing a separate line where people were just walking in with no wait. I went to ask and was informed it was for patrons with VIP cards from certain casinos. This penny playing only machine gal didn't bother to check her membership cards and just continued to wait. Lol. 

Once we were finally seated, my frown went to a smile. We had a very sweet server who recommended our one dish that she confirmed was definitely shareable with two people, woo hoo. The restaurant was fairly big and every seat was taken.  I was in awe of the huge platters on other customers table. The huge stack of chicken and waffles caught my eye as I saw three women share that meal, it was tall like a tower.

My mom and I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w\/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. Everything was delicious but the bacon mash potatoes were exceptional.

Im not sure where to start... the mediocre food or the mediocre service. We stopped by on a Sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). Since we wanted to see the Bellagio Show before is ends at 12AM we stopped by Hash House to check on the wait. We were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. We asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). We cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. We were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. After a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. Annoying, I should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. One friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. He asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. All we receive was a ""no, we cant do that"". Cant or Wont? Still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. So I guess they could do it. Finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... Or were we. We placed our orders based on their ""late night menu"", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). The waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. Heres were it went south quickly. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs Benedict?! The wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food I would gladly wait. First thing I noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. I ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). The waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. I look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. The waiter quickly snaps at me ""I had them remake the whole plate"" to which I reply ""I highly doubt that, because its not hot."" The icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. They remade the whole plate... really? There was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. We received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. His name was David BTW, I was so pissed off I made sure to look it up so I could mention him, by name, in this review. The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good. Its OK at best. Its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. Its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, mashed potatoes and sauce and call it spectacular. I know good food and this is no where close. Not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. The most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. That was pretty awe inspiring.

Before getting seated, I realized that this is the place Adam visited on the show 'Man vs Food'. That got me pretty excited, and I kept reading the comments on the wall of fame about the amazing Chicken waffles.

Let's first start of by saying that the portions at this place are HUGE. So sharing is definitely caring - and necessary at Hash House A Go Go.

The Chicken Waffles is basically a ginormous plate consisting of 5 or 6 Belgian waffles, decorated with two big pieces of fried chicken. The chicken  was perfectly seasoned and had that special ""crunch"" to it. It was 95% meat, so no playing around with bones and stuff  - just serious Chick'n business!
But overall, it's just waffles and a fried chicken, so nothing to really get excited about. Service is so-so. You don't really feel special, and the servers are not super attentive. 

Not sure if it is a ""must visit"", but if you're around and just want to experience something different in terms of.. well, not really different, but just overwhelming in the sense of portion.. then hit up to Imperial Palace, and visit Hash House.

The waiter was quirky and funny, and also very friendly :) He recognized us the second time we came too (""Oh, long time no see!"") We heard about the giant portions of Hash House, and we starved ourselves accordingly. Still, we could only order 3 plates for 6 people :\ Be warned that there it is $2.50ish for every extra PLATE they put on the table for sharing! So with both days, we ordered:

Chicken and waffles: AMAZING. A-MAAAAA-ZINGGGGGG!!!!!! We ordered this twice because it was so good! Big bacon strips cooked right INTO the waffle and sticking out at all sorts of delicious angles! Not too sweet to overpower, yet not too salty to be weird. YUM. I could eat a whole plate by myself! The chicken was not bad either, though alone I felt that it was a bit bland. The fried green onions around it also gave the dish a great zing!

Chicken benedict: Not really a benedict, as there is no hollandaise sauce. Instead, it is a creamy chipotle sauce that my friends LOVED. They actually ordered extra sauce ($1.95) and cleaned it COMPLETELY. The benedict was very filling, but also good...I'm just not really sure what I ate aside from the chicken and the biscuit or something...

Meatloaf: Holy mother of pearl this was GOOD! Meatloaf was tender and held together just right! The potatoes were also very delicious and the green beans were cooked to a nice delicate crunchy perfection! Carrots were meh, but no one's complaining with the rest of the dish! Tip: Meatloaf tastes ORGASMIC with the chipotle cream sauce!

Chicken pot pie: This was very good as well. Light and a teensy bland\/plain compared to the other dishes, but still good in its own right. My friend busted out the tabasco to spice it up, and I put in a bit more salt and pepper. Chicken was moist, and the chunks of potato and veggies were all cooked just right. Only thing was that the biscuit was hard as a rock. I think I finally broke one with my teeth and a part of the biscuit flew out and near hit the person across from me. I don't mind too much though as the rest of the dish (and the other dishes) were so good.

Pancake, scrambled eggs, potatoes: The pancake is GIANT! The godfather of all pancakes! It was probably 5 normal IHOP pancakes (make that 6 or 7) clumped together and stacked with another 6 or 7 pancakes! Not as delicious as the waffle IMO, but definitely a WOW factor. The pancake had a good taste, but at some points it did feel like it was way too thick for me (not what she said). Not much to say on the eggs (they were normal?), but the potatoes had this weird crunchiness which made us wonder if it was leftover fried potatoes from breakfast\/lunch...seemed to be re-fried or something. Both eggs and potatoes need more salt, but I honestly just wouldn't order this dish. Why get pancakes when you got CHICKEN AND WAFFLES?!?

Overall? Mouthgasm. It was funny seeing my guy friends just put a bite in their mouth, sit back, and siiiiiiiiiiiiigh. Definitely come here when you stop by Vegas! Oh, and as for pricing...this was essentially all-you-can-eat as there was SO MUCH FOOD and you definitely need to share! Total for both times (again, 5-6 people, 3 dishes) came out to be around $15 WITH tip\/tax+2 extra sauces. Great deal for delicious food in giant portions!",0,1,1

Order the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Perfectly crispy fried chicken with small thick fluffy waffles (I wish the waffles were thinner and crispy but that's just my preference). I also recommend any of the Benedicts (Smoked Salmon is sooo good!) Also prepare yourself as the presentation of these dishes are insane and do not disappoint.

The best thing about it was it did not disappoint one bit. As practically every other yelper has pointed out, the wait is inevitable, regardless of the time (mind you they're open 24 hours!), so if your dying of starvation and cannot wait more than 30 minutes go somewhere else. 

For our party we waited approximately about an hour during the brunch rush. To kill the time we went downstairs to the casino level and gambled until the time was eaten up. After being seated we were waited on within a few minutes. The staff is extremely friendly, they warn you about the big portions & fully break down the menu for what they're known for. We kinda went all out on the food because it was so affordable & experienced a major food coma but it was tots worth it! We ended up ordering the roast chicken & rosemary hash, chicken & waffles, & the fried chicken Indiana favorite that came with bacon mash & eggs. Talk about MAJOR portions, they're humungous & everything was either a WOW or mmmmm. Their chicken was so crispy on the outside but so moist & tender on the inside, to die for! The waffles were so fluffy & their maple reduction when you combine the chicken with the waffle is just a salty sweet perfect bite.

You can get a drink to liven up your wait a bit, though. The bloody mary is actually very good. And large... like everything else here. 

The portions are huge and sickeningly so.  It wouldn't surprise me if they adopted a policy of wheeling food out in a wheelbarrow -- it would fit the theme perfectly!  Every plate I saw cleared around us was still half full, as the TV was playing a commercial to help starving African kids.  It felt pretty indecent to be throwing away all this food just for some 'Murican farmhouse gimmick. 

The flavors were good, but everything just kind of gave me indigestion.  The Benedicts come with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. Everything's just a little overboard.  The smoked salmon Benedict isn't with lox how you would expect it to be, but salmon with smoke flavoring. It was still pretty good, but wasn't what I thought I was ordering.

I think the gimmick wins over the actual experience.  When your food first appears in front of you, you're kind of star-struck and giddy.  But about 3 bites in, you realize you're just about done and there's no fridge in your hotel room.",2,2,1

I saw the chicken and waffles.  I thought to myself, ""self, there's no way the chicken and waffles is that big, it must be a fake promo picture.""

I was wrong.

To say it came out of the kitchen on a ""plate"" would be misguiding.  This dish came out on a borderline serving platter.

Two huge pieces of fried chicken, stabbed into place by a knife into a set of three gigantic Belgian waffles.

""But... But... No bacon"", you stutter frantically.  Yes bacon, it's literally cooked into the waffles.

Their supplier must have been having a fire-sale on rosemary, because every dish I saw escape that kitchen was speared with a gigantic sprig of it.

Besides the gigantic portions, the food itself was exceptionally tasty.  The chicken had crispy skin, the waffles were soft on the inside but crunchy enough on the outside so that the syrup didn't reduce them to mush.  The various sauce drizzles and garnish elements added some extra flavor.

The size of this thing is huge but I cleaned it no problem.

What was disappointing though was that although the combination is crazy and unique, it was rather bland and dry.  I hardly ever use ketchup on my breakfast but I had to resort to that since the chicken was extremely dry.  

The boyfriend got a regular omelet w\/ a bloody mary (you get to keep the glass) and the younger brother ordered the bacon waffle w\/ whipped cream and a glass of milk but our server failed and brought out chocolate milk instead.  

The food took some time because we were told everything was made from scratch.

I was pissed that I had no reception (AT&T\/iPhone) plus I did not want to drain my battery.

ENORMOUS portions. Definitely recommend splitting with someone or being ready to pack about half of it and take it home. Definitely make sure you go hungry. There are reasonable prices given the quantity of food. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was $15.95 and easily enough to feed two; this was one of the most expensive items on the breakfast menu. There were plenty of menu selections for the $9-15 range.

The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is apparently their signature dish (with Man vs. Food notoriety). I was really impressed with the way it was assembled and presented. However, every bite ended up being a gigantic mess of hollandaise sauce (which they refer to as ""chipotle cream""; did not taste anything like chipotles and tasted everything like standard hollandaise), potatoes, biscuit, and chicken. Had they made the dish slightly smaller and more manageable, it would have been a much higher-quality entree.

In addition, call me a purist, but it is a travesty to call any dish without poached eggs a ""Benedict"". The thin tasteless layer of scrambled eggs on top seemed more like an afterthought to the dish rather than a main component. Why not call it a ""fried chicken scramble"" that happens to include hollandaise sauce?

Other complaints: Drinks were really cool-looking but not very alcoholic. Wi-Fi didn't work and zero cell reception in the building.

Overall, the place wasn't bad, but unremarkable. It works in Vegas, but that's about it.",1,0,0

Although there was no nearly wait time when we arrived around 11:30am, what one would think is near peak hours for a restaurant, the food that arrived was pretty terrible. 

Ordering the tractor combo, $12.95, I got a fairly large blueberry pecan pancake (flour, eggs, buttermilk cheap carbs) with two eggs and two slices of bacon. One of my friends later pointed out that the pancake alone was $7.95. Ripoff combo? I think so. The quality of the pancake was on par with any IHOP or instant mix and the blueberries were undoubtedly frozen and few and far in between along with the pecans.

My other friends ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, $15.95, and a Burger, $13.95. The Sage Fried Chicken being the restaurant's signature dish seemed like it should be the best dish. However, all that arrived was a heaping mound of mash potatoes (very cheap carbohydrates once again) covered by greens and a pair of biscuits with a fried chicken breast steak. The chicken breast was so dry that the fibers were distinctly frazzled after a bite and tough enough to compete with jerky. The burger that came was clearly overcooked and consisted of low-quality ground beef and over-sized buns. 

Incessant praise for large portions at this restaurant seem misguiding in that only the cheapest components of each dish are liberally given while the main components (the protein and pricier ingredients) are sparse and low quality.

After waiting about 1\/2 hour we were seated in a haze of customers and servers. Our server came over pretty quick and I ordered one massive Bloody Mary which was dropped off pretty quick. I think it cost me 20 bucks. The server was very friendly and made some decent suggestions. 

My buddy opted for the chicken and waffles. It looked really good but he said that the waffles were soggy and really took away from the dish. I ordered the dish I saw on Man vs. Food, which was fried chicken, spinach, eggs, cheese, mashed potatoes and a bunch of other things. It was good but it really was just too much for the sake of being too much.

Seriously though, their portions are GINORMOUS.... like spilling-over-the-plate huge. One flapjack will be enough for a late night snack and maybe breakfast \/ lunch the next day. Not your ordinary wussy pancake. If you come late at night, you can eat well and save half your flapjack for the next morning when you wake up starving. 

We also got a few other things aside from the flapjacks. Being as basic as I am, I ordered ""The Basic,"" which included two eggs, a meat (I picked bacon), some potatoes, and toast. The potatoes were on point. Very well seasoned, done to perfection. Couldn't stop eating them. Everything else tasted great too. 

One pitfall is that this establishment on the second floor, and there's no restroom in the restaurant. If you have to go, you gotta make a trip downstairs to find the restroom in the casino. That's a royal pain, especially if you're there after a night out in heels and your feet are already dying. The last thing anyone in that situation wants to do is climb stairs and FIND a bathroom. 

I'd definitely return, though. I really appreciate that this place is 24 hours, which means you can come when you need to. The employees are nice, even toward rowdy people coming in at ungodly hours.

Luckily, they have AMAZING Bloody Marys, mimosas, and various other breakfast beverages while you wait and chat with the other hungry brunchers. I would strongly suggest the Tangerine Mimosa and the BLT Bloody Mary. Trust me. 

Another thing I would suggest is to listen for your name when the hostess calls you instead of laughing hysterically at the bar about nothing in particular or you will miss your table...but the good thing is, if this happens to you, they are pretty nice and will fit you in pretty quickly. 

When you get to the table, there's only one thing you need to worry about ordering. And it's big enough for like 3 people. THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Oh my dear lord.

i had the roast chicken has and he had the meatloaf hash. I couldn't even finish mine. somehow my husband managed to polish his off.

I would ask that there be some type of jam or butter to put on the biscuts that come w\/ the hash. They're too dry to eat plain.

Brunch. Vegas. Hangover-worthy. Hair of the dog. Welcome to Hash House a Go Go. I had checked into my hotel on Yelp, it posted on Twitter and a friend recommended we come down to The Quad and eat here.  Looks Good!  And off we walked.  We took a leisurely stroll from Mandalay Bay all the way up the strip and into The Quad and found HHAGG.  Wowza, it was packed.  We put in our name (5 people) and they told us 45 minutes to an hour.  They directed us to the left to order a cocktail while we waited and were told there might be a place to sit down in the bar.  A couple of us went in to get coffees and found us 5 seats at the bar - Score!

We sat down and were introduced to Kye, with her spiky locks, and Tiffany - a duo full of personality and who ""pour the cocktails like we like to drink them!""  Okay, I'm sold!  A couple of us ordered Irish coffees - knock me on my ass - while we perused the menu.  So many options.  Thanks to Yelp, I had narrowed it down and knew I wanted the Sage Fried Chicken - problem is that it appears in 4 different places on the menu!! Oy!

After much debate, and recommendations from Tiffany, I opted for something from the ""Indiana Favorites"" section of the menu.  This was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w\/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit.  I asked for my eggs to be scrambled with cheddar cheese.  When the plate came - holy moly that's a lotta food!  The biscuit was the size of a softball with a sprig of rosemary stuck in the top.  

The potatoes were delightful - smashed and the bacon was not super crispy, which I love. The reduction of maple was like crack.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and salted - they did need some pepper.  As for the chicken, it was not fried enough.  The crust was a bit doughy and tasted of flour - clearly they were dealing with a lot of covers and quality control suffered. Not acceptable.  Luckily, the rest of my meal was great, but I would probably go with something else next time.  My friend got the pork tenderloin - impeccably fried.  Golden brown and delicious!

Now let's talk cocktails - strong, powerful, strong.  We enjoyed ourselves so much with Kye and Tiffany, we started doing shots.  Watching them craft drinks and deliver food - I wanted to come back over and over and try every food item and fancy drink.  Plus, they were a delight to talk to and have serve us.

I'll be going back each trip for sure and I have already recommended it to a friend going to Vegas in a couple of weeks. HHAGG is the place to eat.",4,1,3

My girlfriend and I had brunch their one Sunday and not much went well.  We arrived to a 30 minute wait and were happy that it wasn't longer.  Upon being seated, we noticed that at least a third of the tables were empty.  Why the wait if there are open tables?

Upon sitting down we were greeted by a waitress who said she would be ""right back"".  I guess our definitions of ""right back"" were different because we didn't see her for another 10 minutes.  When she got back we ordered our drinks and our meals.  After this point, we didn't see our waitress again for 45 minutes.

Our meals came out roughly 20 minutes after we ordered them and we had to tell the server that we never got our drinks.  To make this worse, they messed up the drink order when we did get it.

The food looked amazing and both my girlfriend and I thought that all would be forgiven.  Turns out we were wrong.  The food was presented beautifully but unfortunately it looked much better then it tasted.  Everything was bland, very bland.  Not what I expected at all.  To top it off, I had to drag down another table's waiter to find ours and get the check.

I looked this place up on Yelp and  came here solo since my bf was playing poker.  I don't mind eating by myself.  This place is located in the Quad and you had to take an escalator there.  I waited in this line right outside the door for a good 2 minutes before somebody told me that this was the line for the bar.  The people in front of me and behind me thought they were waiting to put their name down too!  The hostess stand is actually further and right in front of the restaurant, not at the doors entering the restaurant.  Lame.

So it was super fast putting my name down, but I told them once a seat opened up at the bar I'd probably sit there.  He told me it'd be a 40 minute wait on a Saturday at10AM.I looked around and people seemed to be ordering the chicken and waffles but that seemed like too big of a meal for me.  It took me around 30ish minutes for a seat to open up at the bar.  Then like 4 freaking seats opened up after me and nobody sat down (ugh).  I wanted waffles though so I ordered the combo which came with pancakes but you could upgrade to a waffle for a buck.  I also ordered a bloody mary.  So after I order they come out with chicken and waffles!  They messed up on my one order so that super sucked.  The bartender admitted it and asked if I wanted another bloody mary and it'd be on her since they messed up but I declined since I'd be too blasted walking back to my hotel.  The bloody mary was really good but the food was just like.... not good.  The waffle looked nice and big and fluffy but it was lukewarm and soggy.

We arrived at our hellhole hotel (The Quad) at 9am and we couldn't check in until 12pm.  To waste time, we checked out the car show and then decided to have brunch.  Since HHAGG is in the Quad and had such great reviews, we decided to give it a shot.  It was packed when we got there but we ended up scoring a seat at the bar.

When the bartender took our drink orders, hubs got a water and I asked for a chocolate milk - when it was served, it wasn't even the real chocolate milk...it was white milk with hershey's syrup pooled at the bottom!  It hadn't even been stirred!  Whatever...I choked it down while I perused the menu.  We ended up making our choices and I ordered the eggs\/bacon\/potato\/biscut breakfast and hubs got the special burger they had that day.  

The waitress got our order and then about 5 minutes later she got the orders of the people on other sides of us.  Well, we waited, and waited, and waited....we wanted to order mimosas to celebrate our trip but the bartender was MIA....we finally got so annoyed when she finally did show up that we just stuck with waters.  Finally they brought out food....to our neighbors!!  Bartender assured us twice that our food was ""coming right up"" but it seriously took over an hour from the time we placed our order to the time we got our food.  Reminder: I got freaking EGGS and he got a burger.  Unless they had to murder the cow and grind the meat right there, an hour is unacceptable.

Whatever, I was irritated but hungry so I tucked into my eggs.  Eggs=meh - I ordered scrambled and they were partially runny and partially burned....neither of which I like.  Bacon was good, potatoes were great and the biscut and homemade jam were the jam!  I look over at hubs and he's looking a little green....he bit into his burger and it. was. raw.

Like...still able to see the white bits of fat in the beef raw.  So after a few minutes of searching, we were able to flag down the bartender and she apologized profusely and said another one would be ""right up.""  It was obvious that this was a biiiig mistake because we had at least 3 people checking on us (managers and cooks) and apologizing profusely, and they even brought us out a free cornbread (phenomenal) for the whole issue.  However, it took another 20 minutes to get another burger - by that time I was done with my breakfast (1\/2 of which he ate) and he wasn't feeling another burger anyways, so he took one bite and boxed it up.  He ended up throwing it out once we got to our room.  They did comp his meal but I would have been furious if they hadn't.  They did handle the issue as best as they could, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.  Maybe, MAYBE would I understand if the food came out freaky fast, but if they couldn't get it right in over an hour, I don't know how they get anything right.",2,1,1

It wasn't and maybe that's when i should have said something but the guy didn't really seem like he cared what the answer was.
Ordered bacon and eggs benedict came covered in a red sauce, marinara sauce on eggs benedict?? and it tasted really bad. they said they don't have hollandaise omg. last time i came here they did and it was awesome. This time i just asked for a side of gravy and tried to salvage my biscuits. 4.00 charge to make this dish edible.
My friends breakfast was served with the egg very undercooked, i understand sunny side up but like at least turn the heat on in the pan. 
I had been telling him how great this place is and man now do i have egg on my face.
I can't believe how much of a letdown this was. They have not just gone downhill they have gone from one of the best places to get a good meal on the strip to a place i loathe.

I must say their corned beef hash was actually really good. It was the first that I had devoured which had not caused my insides to be overloaded with a salty after taste. I tip my hat to the hash house for that one and all others should take note that corned beef hash doesn't need to be over salted to be bueno!

This was a short review, but what can I say? The service has always been top notch, the food is out of this world, and thank goodness when I come to Vegas I have found a must see for breakfast time and time again!",2,2,2

I like pecans - and this salad delivered (almost to the point where I was almost ready to say no more - which is surprising for me).

The food is huge - my salad would easily serve a family of 4 - and as such, I did not finish it.  It was quite filling and prices were very reasonable.

If you want a casual meal which will fill you up, this place is a go to place.  If you want fine dining - its not; but for breakfast, lunch, or a casual dinner, the place delivers.

Service was good.  The piped in music is ok here - but a bit loud (we had one person with some hearing issues).  We still were able to have a conversation though.

My friends told me several years ago how awesome this place was, and the hubz and I put it on our list of places to check out when we were in Vegas for our anniversary vacation.

Staff
The staff here is absolutely amazing. They seated us quickly at a nice spacious table so we could relax (It was already almost 100 degrees outside at 7 am! We were sweating and we had hats and hydration packs). Our waitress was super friendly! She immediately brought two glasses of ice water! We asked her what she recommended to eat and she showed us the top recommendations. We also asked if they had souvenir glasses (we collect them) and she recommended the twister glass. It's a really interesting shaped glass that slants sideways. She even gave us refills on our drink! She was even prepared and got us to go boxes, take home utensils, and a bag when she saw us struggling on our food! (IT'S HUGE!!!) Literally she was an amazing waitress. I wish I had her name to thank her for making our day before we left to the final day of EDC (I ate my left overs in the room at 4 am and was a happy camper!). BTW a group of ravers coming back from the festival were horrible and left her a huge mess of wasted food and crumpled bills, no tip (I'm assuming). It broke my heart, but despite that she took care of us and we thank her for that.
EDIT: Our server was Tara S!!! Thank you Tara!!! We still are raving about our experience!
Food
The portions here are HUGE! Like seriously a plate can easily feed two people, so watch what your order. I got the chicken and waffles and the hubz got the Benedict recommended from Man vs Food. OMG!!!! the presentation was amazing!!! Like I was kinda tearing up how awesome it looked and tasted! The chicken was seasoned beautifully. It had crispy skin and it was so juicy. The waffles had large strips of bacon in them!!!! Mind blown! I don't like eggs so my husband let me try his loaded mash potatoes and I died.....they were AWESOME!!!! Like I could have just ate that! 

I can't recommend coming here enough! It was probably my favorite place to eat at in all of Vegas. It's open 24 hrs, they have cute farm decor ( My husband loves farms and especially cows so he was pleased!), and the food is definitely worth the price. I'm already missing that chicken ToT

The portions at this place are INSANE. you can easily split one meal between 2 or 3 people. We probably would have only ordered one meal if we had known but it was our first time. 

The bacon and eggs my girl ordered were great. She ate maybe 15% of the food they gave her. 

The chicken and waffles were amazing. Crispy chicken that was flavorful and juicy on the inside. The waffles were light and fluffy and to top it off there was bacon cooked in the middle! My inky complaint would be that there wasn't enough syrup lol. 

We left ridiculously full and happy. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a huge meal that tastes amazing but won't break the bank(in Vegas at least. Lol).

The Bloody Mary was so thick and tasteless I couldn't drink it, it didn't even resemble anything like what a Bloody Mary should taste like!

The duck was delicious and super juicy!! I loved the potato\/sweet potato mash they included with it. The only thing I HATED about this was the goat cheese that was just put there. I didn't feel like the flavors mixed and the goat cheese literally made me want to gag.

-Corned Beef, red onions and Swiss cheese  -AWESOME SAUCE

-Griddled HH meatloaf & 2 eggs served with mashed potatoes, fruit & biscuit - Now of course my husband had to be different and go against the grain and order this and he  was disappointed but he is lucky I love him so I shared my chicken and waffles and hash with him (yes I order both, I mean you only live once right)

They put bacon in the waffles, which I was really looking forward to, but the bacon was soggy and not cooked all the way. My friends got the hash with chorizo which they enjoyed. Everything we ordered came out fast. The downsides for me were the soggy bacon, the loud music and there were a lot of kids. Other then that GREAT place. I would go back.

This place is located inside the Quad (Formerly Imperial Palace).  I went here with my wife last Saturday for brunch.  The main reason I would give this place 3.5 stars is definitely not because of the food, but because of the atmosphere.  First off, it's located inside the Quad hotel, which in general is dumpy and has a high population of riffraff.  When we went, the place was very busy (Minimum 30 minute wait for 2 people) and loud.  They don't have a lot of seating, so we ended up just standing and waiting.  I'm not sure if it's because of where it's located in the hotel, but we got no cell phone service in this restaurant.  Again, because it's so loud in here, it's not exactly the best place to hold a conversation.  That said, if loud music and good people watching is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this place.  The food here was actually very good, and they give you way too much of it.  My wife ordered the sage chicken and waffles with bacon, while I simply had a bacon sandwich with fries.  Both were good.  I really wasn't in the mood for breakfast food that day, so my options were limited.  Also, it seemed like we had to wait for a long time to get our food, mostly because they were busy.

If you don't like loud music and conversation, DON'T GO HERE. That's just how it is, and complaining about it isn't going to change a thing. If you go to a restaurant and expect the ambiance, temperature, and other patrons to revolve around you, then I suggest you just open your own damn restaurant. There might be a wait, especially on weekends, but they give you a pager that has quite a range so you can go into the casino and play slots or do whatever while you wait for your table. It only took about 15-20 minutes for us to get seated. DEFINITELY worth the wait.",0,0,0

We arrived at about 10:30 AM, and the wait was surprisingly only about 30 minutes. Score!  A huge plus was the bloody Mary bar at the hostess stand that was serving the Farmer's Bloody Mary (I think that's what it was called).  It was perfectly spicy with a yummy pickled green bean, which I'm pretty sure was my husband's favorite part.  Luckily for me, he's easy to please.

We were seated very quickly after our name was called, right as we were finishing up our drinks.  Our server's name was Gabby, and she was extremely attentive, helpful with menu suggestions and had an overall great personality.

We ordered another bloody Mary to split: the BLT in a large souvenir glass.  The bacon was really good, but the toast and lettuce were obviously just for show.  We didn't care, we ate them anyway.  Honestly, the toast was kind of like a crouton in that the crunch factor was super strong, so it was pretty good dipped in the Mary.  But maybe it's because we were still halfway buzzed. Anyway, the Mary was big enough to split and really good, but the Farmer is definitely where it's at. I ordered the meatloaf hash for my meal with over-medium eggs, and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles.  They both got destroyed. I'm going to say there was at least a half of a very well seasoned crispy-fried chicken on his plate, along with 4 fluffy Belgian waffles with bacon cooked right into them. I'm glad he went to the restroom halfway through the meal, because I was able to stealthily snag at least 5 giant bites without him even noticing. It was that huge of a serving.  He was even nice enough to let me have some of his fried leeks, which were delicious on their own and mixed in with my hash.  The meatloaf is damn good, especially mixed all together with perfectly cooked over-medium eggs, melty cheese, country style potatoes, peppers, onions (and those addictive crunchy little fried leeks).  I sprinkled some pepper sauce on top and went to town, finishing pretty much all of it except some extra potatoes that didn't make it onto my fork.  It also came with a big, fat buttermilk biscuit which I took a few bites of, but would have been even better with butter and some homemade jam.  I didn't ask for it, because I already felt fat enough.

We waddled out of the restaurant all smiles, completely full, but not feeling weighed down and gross like you just ate a bunch of junk.  This is some top-notch home-cooked stuff-your-face-like-you-don't-give-a-what food.

One went to this location and the other went to the West Vegas location.  Since I had just got into town, I wasn't willing to venture a drive so my group walked across the street to the IP to eat here. It was a Sunday so brunch menu was on.  After a modest wait, the hostess sat us down and after a couple of minutes, we were ready to order.  Then we waited...and waited...and waited...no water, no server greeting, nothing!  One of us flagged down a server and asked him if he was our server and he said he wasn't.  He said that he would try to find ours.  Then more waiting...and still nothing.  At this point, it was getting to the ridiculous stage.  Finally after 20 minutes of waiting, I went to the bar seating area and asked the bartender for four glasses of water.  I also told her that we have been ignored and she volunteered to take our order for us.  Thank you!!!  She literally saved our day...

Now I can go into how much food there was and how good it tasted and the combination of their chicken and waffles was...BUT, this place had a huge service failure which makes the food quality irrelevant in this case.  Sorry kitchen guys, nothing against y'all.

I do know that our bartender\/server did speak to someone regarding the fact that our table was forgotten but did we get an apology or acknowledgement from a management rep?  Nope.  Am I surprised?  Not really.  With the way that they turn over tables and the mass amount of people\/tourists that come through here, I'm really not surprised that the customer service is this severely lacking.  When I saw that the server who had the tables next to ours tell us that he couldn't take our order because he wasn't our ""server"", then that was a big warning sign that the management team here has not fostered an environment of teamwork within the front of house staff.  If they were a ""team"", then somebody would have stepped up and took our order despite us not being in his or her section.  Customer should come first but obviously that's not the case here.  

Hash A Go Go...I give you 3.5 stars for your food and product but the Imperial Palace location, I give you zero and that goes directly to the management who run this place on a daily basis.  I know for a fact that I'm not ever going to come back to this location.  

Belated thanks again to our savior who was the only person who helped to take our order and save our day.  We tipped her cash and in full and I asked that she not split that tip with her other servers because she was the only one who deserved it.",1,0,0

Located inside a maze of a hotel (I'll give them the fact that they're remodeling) we are seated in a strange room of booths. The interior is dim and uninviting.

Our waiter was alright, but seemed a bit frazzled. He kept repeating the items I was ordering with different names than what I was reading off the menu. He also gave an air of irritation because I was just listing off the orders for everyone at the table.

This place is the perfect example of quantity over quality.

Although the food wasn't bad, it wasn't stellar and definitely not food that I'd recommend to others or return for. Sometimes having two huge heaping mounds of smoked salmon on giant biscuits and mashed potatoes is just TOO much. Even when shared amongst two people.

The sage fried chicken was moist, but lacking in flavor. There was nothing special about the dish. I didn't taste any sage, the syrup was regular ole maple syrup. 

The style of hash was boring. Shredded dry meat. Potato cubes. It didn't hit the spot at all. And the gigantic looming biscuit was dry and brittle and really just a sponge to soak up any grease.

SERVICE: Friendly and patient while I pored over the tantalizing menu, asking repeatedly for a couple more minutes. Even though the waitress was clearly busy, she kept checking on us. 

FOOD: I got talked out of ordering the (gigantic) blueberry pancakes and went with the chicken and waffles instead. It comes with 4 big waffle squares and 2 large fried chicken breasts. Definitely too much for one person. If the chicken fried steak is on the menu when you're there, you have to get it. It was enormous.

I ordered the infamous Safe Fried Chicken & Waffles. I really didn't know what to expect, so I was surprised when I was served a sculpture. Yes friends, this was a work of art. Four waffles beautifully arranged with two chicken breasts skewered on top, covered with shallots and other garnishes. 

The waffles didn't have too much syrup on them, which is exactly how I like it. To my surprise, there was bacon cooked into the waffles, which was a pleasant surprise.

I ordered the Meatball Pasta - which was actually reasonably sized (if you've been here you know what I mean) compared to other entrees.  Five rather nice sized and delicious meatballs were underneath a bed of perfectly cooked thick spaghetti and a great marinara with chunks of sweet tomatoes.  I ate the whole damn thing.  Outstanding.  My wife went with the Baby sized burger, which is still bigger than 3\/4 of the burgers out there and it was also outstanding.  The highlight was the Cheddar Cheese Bacon potatoes on the side.  If you like that tasty cheese that slightly burns on the edge of a grilled cheese, you'll get a small plateful of it on top of delicious potatoes.  Drinks were also good, and all of this for an extremely reasonable price with OUTSTANDING service.  We will be back here again!!",0,0,0

Fine we sat somewhere that was open. Then asked our waitress who came around 10 minutes after we were seated ( place was Very slow and 3 different waiters passed by) I asked her if we could order from the dinner menu as hubby wanted ribs ( it was like 330 pm ) She proceeded to look and speak to us as if we just asked her the dumbest thing on the planet... Said NO dinner starts at 5! If you want to look over the lunch menu or bye .. Basically told us to leave ... This is almost as good as the experience at planet dailies ... Not sure which was worse.

Till Thursday!""  He said, ""Any day mid-week after 10:30 is generally no wait at all.""

I Called AGAIN on Wednesday morning to double check and the gentleman said there's no wait at all.  We got down there about 45 minutes later, and as said, we were promptly seated with no wait.  Our server was a really nice guy who was on top of his game.  Polite, Kind, and Friendly.  Three things most servers should practice!

My wife ordered a egg scramble that was decent sized, it came with a biscuit and she ordered a mimosa and said that all of it tasted really good.  I tasted the scramble, it had chicken, corn, eggs and cheese.  Maybe a few other things I cant remember but it tasted really fresh!

I got the Fried Chicken Bene!!! My eyes were HUGE with amazement at this insane looking mound of food that was put on my table.  I stared at it wondering how the hell do you eat this thing!?!?  After simply ""diving in"", I had a system going and it was going well!!! So many flavors colliding that I was very impressed.  The chipotle topping was a nice flavor added to everything else.

You could easily share a meal, and because they have so many tasty options on the menu you could order several and share them so you can try a few dishes at a time. 

The fried chicken dinner and waffle meal comes with large, crispy, juicy chicken breasts and a hot belgian style waffle. The hash is served with home fries, eggs your way and chorizo-spicy but so good.  

The bloody mary is a perfect combination of all ingredients-not to tomatoey, with just enough citrus and heat to give your taste buds a kick and vodka to get 'cha mind right for a long, fun day in Vegas, lol.

The atmosphere is casual and fun, especially since they relocated from the M Resort to The Linq. It seems bigger, has a larger waiting area and bar inside, tvs all around in case there's a game on and they also have a great Bloody Mary bar at the entrance which I especially love.

Once the meal comes, focus on highest taste items first, chicken, veggies, eggs, sauce and so on.  If you can clear most of the plate and only have a pile of mashies left behind . . .

I was guided here by Yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. Reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. Finding it inside the Imperial Palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how ""you can't go wrong with anything"" in regards to what I should order. We got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. 

My eyes immediately locked on the Sage Chicken & Waffles once I was presented with the menu. Two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four bacon waffles, coated in syrup. Call a cardiologist because I was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. 

Of course, I can't have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. Enter the B.L.T. Mary, a 20 oz. Bloody Mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. It also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large Melba toast. I opted out of eating it, though. 

Good thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. The portion was gargantuan. I quickly dove in. The chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. The waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. The combination of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience I wanted to have at Roscoe's, but never got. The flavors were so good that I drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. After that, I was certain my stomach was about to explode. 

My gf got the ""basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit"" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. The plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. Even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. Total out the door was about $35, and worth every single penny.

I was with two other guys for a convention and we thought we'd try this out at 11PM.  Service was good.  The food offerings were very good and breakfast appears to served all day.  

I ordered the corned beef hash...it wasn't.  It was corned beef on top of chopped and fried potatos, a load of cheese and a rock hard biscuit.  It was tasty but no hash in the corned beef hash.

A vey stark contrast in design from the very San Diego Hillcrest location, where there's an outdoor patio and warm earth tones and sometimes a DJ on the weekend, to a very cafeteria interior. 

Same items on the menu, breakfast is the way to go, when you go to Hash House A Go Go. I also recommend going when you are ready to inhale a huge portion and probably make this your meal of the day. These are generous portions. Since we were in town for meetings and a tradeshow, felt it was the safer route to just have the freshly squeezed tangerine juice, god bless Vitamin C, you know you'll need some when you're walking through the smokey casinos and doing a little imbibe during your time in Vegas. 

Went the ""healthy"" route with the farm scrambled with ground turkey, broccoli and mushroom along with their addictive crispy potatoes that are perfectly crunchy and charred. Oh but there's more, a homemade  biscuit is included with this meal. Suppose if you need the extra iron, there's a sage leaf that's included as a garnish that you could try to gnaw off on. 

A friend also got the frisbee sized pancakes, didnt try them, but he seemed to enjoy them and again did I mention frisbee sized?

We all did a good job with stuffing our bellys as much as we could. Service is decent, food comes out quick. On another day when you don't have any business meetings, etc I'd say get a cocktail, I've had them before and just a nice way to top off a soon to come food coma.

You won't be leaving here hungry, the portions are massive. With prices ranging from $10-$20 you definitely get your moneys worth. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. While they don't have any omlettes on the menu (what I was planning to order) they more than made up for it with their scramble style plates. I had a avacado, onion, bacon, and swiss scramble which consisted of the aforementioned ingredients with approximately 4 eggs scrambled into a delicious cheesy egg mixture. This included a side of fried potatoes, fruit, and a delicious biscuit. Overall it really hit the spot and I didn't leave feeling terrible about myself. 

However, some of the other items people ordered were absolutely too big. A huge mount of eggs, cheese, meats, and gravy, over a biscuit... at least 2-3 times the size of the entree I ordered. While this was amazing it made me sick just thinking about eating it. So I would recommend ordering a smaller entree if you plan on moving the rest of the day.

Need I say more?

After thinking hard on what to order, we ordered these:
-Andy's sage fried chicken & bacon waffle tower drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks: I thought I would have a heart-attack once I saw how huge it was...in person! Yup...But an enjoyable one, of course... I was actually surprised that it tasted as good as it was! All the flavors go so well together & the fried chicken is surprisingly not greasy at all! & the waffle . . . I love waffles, but this one has bacon pieces inside them!!!Bacon-anything insures ""yummy"" flavor, so as you can tell, this dish was excellent!
-House hash with fresh mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w\/ 2 eggs, served with biscuit: again, this comes packed in a big skillet, so you can  guess how big the portion is . . .This was definitely more of a healthier choice from the menu, but the portion...will not make it so healthy  afterall ;)

I would probably cook this much food for the whole family; not for one person-
only thing i recommend you at hash house a go go is that you think about the portions & share accordingly . . . 
We ordered two dishes for four people & we still had some left-over!

Anyways, my husband and I were traveling w\/ our kids and the 'rents so we played it safe rather than go to Hooters, lol. I whipped out my ever-ready i-phone and brought up my trusty Yelp app and went to work. We were looking for breakfast near our hotel and I saw this place pop up. I sat on my hotel bed wondering where I had heard this restaurants name before...and then it hit me...Man vs. Food!!! So I just had to try it.

We arrived, and I do have to say the location was rather difficult to navigate. It is in the Imperial Palace on the strip. You have to go to the parking garage (if your driving) and then take a set of elevators to get to the main level then you have to walk a little ways and get on yet another elevator to get inside the main area to access the restaurant. The you have to take the escalator or elevator(again) to get to the floor where the restaurant is located...sheesh, we built up an appetite just doing all that walking.

But boy was it worth it!!! Even as busy as they were for a Saturday at brunch (who knew people were awake that early in Vegas, lol) we were seated w\/in a few short minutes. Our waiter came by and was super friendly. He asked if we had ever ate there before and when we said no he decided to give us a rundown of the menu w\/out boring us and w\/out us forgetting the menu items he suggested.

We placed our order and I'd say w\/in about 15-20min it was brought out to us. I was in total shock when I saw how HUGE HUGE HUGE the portions were. I couldnt believe it and wanted to double check the menu price cause there was no way we were getting all that food for so cheap, even in Vegas. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken w\/ a maple reduction, mashed potato's, tomato slices and a biscuit. The food was soooooo yummy, especially the maple reduction on the fried chicken...who woulda thunk it. My daughter ordered the choc. chip pancake and it was heavenly. I shared a little off of everyone's plate and was not disappointed. I asked for jelly for my biscuit and they brought out a little pot filled w\/ muddled strawberry jam, the BEST!!!

We had to go down a ramp, past the hotel check-in, towards a small elevator. 
I glad we didn't give up. Our server was very friendly and enthusiastic. Sure enough, the portions were huge! I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing! It was a huge tower of four waffles with strips of bacon in the middle, topped with two large chicken breasts. Like I said, the bacon waffle was filled with large pieces of real bacon. The coating on the chicken was really good, fried and sort of sweet and carmelized. The teriyaki sauce on the rim of the plate went really well with the chicken--I should have ordered more on the side.
Our meals were so good that we decided to return two days later. The food is a great value for the price, and everything is cooked really fresh. It's worth the maze to find this place. And it's open 24\/7

We were seated immediately upon entering at 3am on a Wednesday.

Our Sage Fried Chicken orders (1 Benedict and 1 with Bacon Waffles) took ~25 mins to come out, which in hindsight was not worth the wait. 

Yes the portions were redonkulously ginormous. But the flavors: disappointingly subpar; the presentation: unappetizing; and the overall execution left us unsatisfied. 

Two decadent things that make ANYTHING ""Benedict"" sexcellent: hollandaise sauce and perfectly poached eggs. 

So right off the bat this ""Benedict"" is lacking:
* hollandaise is substituted with their ""chipotle cream""... Boooo;
* no yolky goodness. What should've been poached eggs (per my request) still came out scrambled (per standard menu description). Ugh I was so looking forward to satisfying my need to poke a runny yolk. 

My husband liked the mash potatoes my meal was plated atop but I discarded the mushy biscuits beneath the kitchen-sink pile of fluff on my plate... Including the sticks of uncooked spaghetti impaling my food. Hella random garnish - I just didn't get it. 

Bottom line: there are better things we could've spent our $50 on: black jack, pai gow, wheel of fortune, and\/or more alcohol.

After a long night of drinking nothing satiates quite like eggs and toast.  Or Hash House's version with greasy sausage goodness and some runny yolk.  Perfect for sopping up with the biscuit!

The Kokomo Sandwich: Griddled HH famous meatloaf with roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella on old fashioned mild bread.  As you can see, this baby ain't for the faint of heart.

Never mind that I could only muster up the appetite for 2 bites max, this plate o' perfection was just what the doctor ordered for a second night of binge drinking.  Really, the ONLY way to do Vegas, ya dig?! ;D

*Insider's tip:  This particular Hash House a Go-Go is located inside the Quad (2 other locations at the Plaza and W Sahara road) , the newbie hotel\/casino concept wedged right in between Flamingo and the Venetian.  Blink and you'll miss it kind of location.  No one really goes here to gamble, it's more of a meet-and-greet spot to sample some of the strips notable eateries, mainly Hash House.  The connecting hotel is nice and updated so definitely a good spot to book some discounted rooms especially if traveling with a large group.  The restaurant itself is dark and dinghy, very old school Vegas vibe, a startling counterpoint to the Quad's newer interior.  But ya know what?  It's quite PERFECT for the morning recovery when sleeping at the table doesn't feel so out of place, lol. *

Not many appetizers seemed appealing to us, and not much of the breakfast fare appeared on the dinner menu, so my husband and I split the Fried Chicken Benedict. I also had a watermelon lemonade (YUMMY!) and we were served some homemade biscuits with honey butter glaze (YUMMY YUMMY!).

It was very delicious - all of the ingredients were very fresh (crispy and juicy fried chicken breast served on top of split biscuits with tomato, baby spinach, bacon, scrambled eggs, not poached =(  , cheese, and a mixture of onions, peppers, etc. with a spin on the traditional hollandaise sauce. Great meal - lots of food. Oh, and the third mistake we made - the waitress indicated that there was a $3 charge for splitting the plate and suggested we order a side dish, in which case, we wouldn't be charged $3. So, instead, we ordered a $5 bowl of mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon (which was really good) but could have also been shared with another two people.

The friend chicken and waffles? Similarly delicious.

The fried chicken was good and they served HUGE biscuits before the meal.

It was quite small spacewise - had tables, booths, bar area. Open 24\/7. No bathrooms inside, have to use hotel ones downstairs in casino area.

We were staying there the night before, so we decided to go downstairs early at 7:30am on a Sunday to beat the crowd - wait was only about 5 minutes, lots of empty tables. When we left at a little past 8am, the wait time was about 20 minutes.

Waitress was quick to take our order, between 2 people we split the eggs benedict (we did our research beforehand and knew portions were huge). Food arrived quickly, waitress gave us small plates so we could share. Service was great, they were very attentive the entire time. Bill received and closed out quickly at the end. 

Food was delicious - although be prepared, this isn't your normal Benedict. The eggs are scrambled, it's served with fried chicken and biscuit and bacon and mashed potatoes. Nevertheless, it was absolutely delicious! The fried chicken was perfectly crispy but still juicy. The sauce poured on top was delicious too, had a bit of spicy kick to it. Mashed potatoes went very well with the sauce as well. 

Pricewise - very affordable for Vegas food. Under $20 for the item, enough food portion to feed 2 people = a little over $10 per person with tax and tip. Enough food for both people to walk out with full stomachs too! 

Definitely looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu!",1,0,0

Wednesday afternoon, circa 1:30pm: No line, no wait. Seated immediately. SCORE! 

Waitress: Super funny, attentive, and playful. Yep, playful. 

The plates, piled high with over sized food, made me feel like I was eating at a giants dinner party. Which is nice, because it's not often that I get to feel small. Plates are perfect for sharing, or just gorging yourself on an insane amount of food. It should be noted that while most restaurants compensate quality for quantity, this was *not* the case at HH A Go Go. The food was delicious! 

Mango Coconut Pancake: Perfectly cooked with big chunks of fresh mango and delicately shredded coconut. If you're not a big fan of coconut, I'd be wary of this pancake. It packs a hefty serving of the white goodness. 

Biscuits and Gravy: I ordered a side of B&G, sans sausage. The biscuits were light and fluffy, and tasted homemade (I'm willing to bet they are!). The gravy was a perfect consistency and tasted so good! The boyfriend tried the sausage gravy and there were huge chunks of sausage that he LOVED. 


Thursday afternoon, circa 3:00pm: 10 minute wait 

Waitress: Busy. Not as attentive as the one before, but still very friendly and easy going. 

Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich w\/ crispy fries: YUM YUM! A great vegetarian option! Be careful though - you really have to LOVE mushrooms to enjoy this sandwich, as a gigantic portabello serves as the ""meat"". Pesto and goat cheese were on point and the roasted peppers added a nice crisp. Was a tad disappointed in the crispy fries though - there was nothing special about them. Not bad, but not really great either, and def not worth $5. The presentation was beautiful! (will add pics later). 

They also serve a can of beer in a paper bag so you can feel pretty gangsta. I think that alone merits a star.",6,6,6

Its at the Imperial Palace (weird hotel with lots of smokers), went left, right, south, north, couldn't find the place. Asked security for assistance, and bypassed a huge ""HASH HOUSE A GO GO"" sign above an escalator in the middle of the casino. 

This place does not disappoint. The proportions are HUGE. If you can't finish a $6 burger at Carl's Jr then split a plate with a friend. If you CAN finish a $6 burger at carl's jr then split a plate with a friend. They are GENEROUS with proportions.

We ordered the meatloaf breakfast, HH delux (?) plate, and Andy's fried chicken benedict(as seen on Man V Food).

Meatloaf tasted interesting, came out in a skillet with chunks of potatoes and vegetables with two huge biscuit. (I swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). Sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). Other sister ordered their GIANT pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. I mean GIANT pancake. I think it was 1 ft in diameter. It was HUGE, at least 1\/4 inch thick. She of course didn't finish it. I ordered Andy's chicken and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on Man V Food). SOO GOOD.

HUGE biscuits with two huge fried chicken, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. Don't forget to try their homemade JAM. Super delicious. Scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some mashed potatoes. Try the homemade jam. 

The table next to us were a party of 4 HUGE dudes. Macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. They could probably eat everything on the menu. Anyways, they all ordered burgers. They didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. Another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. 

So, A LOT of food. Not expensive. The hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. Only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b\/c we were reading the menu.

We stopped here for breakfast at this newer location inside Imperial Palace.

HUGE portions and way too many choices to make an easy decision on what to order. 
I had the HUGE breakfast Quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, eggs, tomato, cheese, topped with chili cream sauce and served ON a bed of mashed potatoes!!!!!!! YUM! 
Also tried a bite of the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream! YUM. 
Also the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w\/ spinach, bacon and eggs looked great and our friends said it tasted great too!

1945 - Allied firebombing raids destroy most of the palace and grounds.  Eventually, the Allies use an atomic bomb to end the war.

1954 - Godzilla (a direct result of atomic testing) attacks Japan, trouncing Tokyo and the Imperial Palace.  This would be the first in a series of Godzilla attacks.

1979 - The Imperial Palace opens in Las Vegas.  The Emperor clearly needed to raise funds from multiple Godzilla trouncings, so he made it into a hotel\/casino.

2005 - Godzilla (working through a secret shell corporation known as ""Harrah's"" buys the Las Vegas Imperial Palace with plans to destroy it.

2009 - Following a series of really bad films, Godzilla decides against stomping on a Las Vegas casino hardly anyone knows about.  Besides, the Bellagio wouldn't give him permission to rise up out of their fountians.

2010 - Hash House a go-go opens a second Las Vegas location, this time in the Imperial Palace.  Although the Americian farm-fresh food concept clashes with the predominantly Asian theme, The food portions are large enough to feed Godzilla.

Humans eating here are best served to go in groups of two or more and splitting plates family style.  They have a $2.50 split plate charge*, but unless you eat like a linebacker, are a 300 foot tall lizard, or plan to take it home, you will be wasting a lot of food.  Food is very lively and fresh, as well as unusual.  It's not your typical ""country nasty"" (bacon, eggs, sausage, gravy, and biscuts).  It's a total re-invent.  It works, but it is a little pricey even when sharing; A split breakfast for 2, with 2 large (fresh squeezed) Orange Juices came to $29 (not counting Tip).

I love the food but not the price.  Like the Best of the Godzilla films, it only merits 3 stars.

* You can bypass the $2.50 split plate charge if someone just orders a biscuit or a plate of bacon for $1.  It costs less, but you get even more food :P",0,0,0

1.  It smells like cigarette smoke from the casino below.
2.  They play loud and lame music, on top of the overall din from tables being so close together.

They do no substitutions and no additions to their menu. Examples:
My boyfriend says, ""I do not eat pork, would I be able to switch the bacon for-"" the waitress cuts him off and says ""no substitutions!"" His meal came with bacon right on top.

My friend and I both order espressos, mine comes out great, his is watery and pale. He asks if he can get tea instead, and he'll just pay for both. The waiter isn't even apologetic at all that his coffee was made so poorly.  Just an ""oh sorry bout that, can I get you a new one?"" Would have gone a  LONG way.

I asked for the veggie hash with over medium eggs and Swiss cheese on top. The waitress tells me that I can not get cheese. I say, I can't add cheese to my meal? She says, well, you can get a side of shredded cheese. I ask her if my meal will be hot enough that if I place the cheese on top it might melt into it? She says yes. I say ok, I will do that. So the bus boy brings our meals to the table. My eggs are extremely runny and underdone. And the dish is actually cold so the cheesy does not melt at all. I wait for the waitress to come, 10 minutes after my friends start eating she walks by and I flag her down. I ask her if they could pop the skillet back on the stove for a few minutes so that my eggs could cook. She says no. But that if I really wanted they could make me a whole new one. (So basically wait another 15 minutes and then start eating when my friends will be ready to leave)

The waffles and biscuits look beautiful though. I just hate terrible service. And people who can't even be bothered to stick cheese on top of my scramble while it's hot enough to melt a bit.  The soup Nazzi thing isn't cute when it's a chain, that only works for mom and pop shops.",1,0,0

I had the avocado and bacon scramble with fried potatoes and fresh fruit, and my friend had the chorizo hash. Both dishes were huge, really pretty, and extremely tasty.

Gary made a few drink suggestions and I wound up with the Watermelon drink.  I'm not going to post a pic because there are already plenty of pics.  Let's just say it hit the spot.  One friend had a Bloody Mary that was perfectly spiced and another friend had a Pineapple concoction that was delicious - not too sweet either.
We only had 2 food orders, I had the basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns and a biscuit.  The biscuit satisfied every carb craving I had.  And Gary brought out a homemade jam that was the perfect topping.
My friend had the waffle with eggs and bacon.  Gary noticed right away that the waffle was just a tinge overcooked and asked her if she preferred it lighter.  She said yes and he had a new one in front of her in a blink of an eye. Great Customer Service. It's always nice to have someone that is watching out for you when you are spending money.  Gary was very busy - running behind that bar and getting drinks for the restaurant as well but we never felt like we had to flag him down or hope to get his attention.  He was on top of things!
My breakfast was only $11 which I thought was very reasonable - especially considering the size of that biscuit.  Plus I had cantaloupe and an orange slice on my plate.  I was stuffed!


Would I go back?  Well, I'm turning right back around and doing the same trip - so I'll take my chances and check it out and see if there is a spot open at the bar - and hopefully Gary will be there again.  If not - I will make a plan to go to the one in Orlando and hopefully get an order of that Chicken and Waffles I keep ogling!!",2,0,2

I got the #1 scramble and my friends got a buttermilkl pancake and the sage chicken and waffles.  None of us were happy with our food.  The scramble came with fried potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  The potatoes were cooked well but, like most of the food we received, was bland.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and had no butter, gravy, or even jam. The scramble itself was quite runny wich was very odd and still fairly bland.  
My friend's waffles had bacon in then and were OK. The fried chicken however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it. Had no flavor beyond that. 
The pancake my other friend got was just a big pancake. Nothing special.  The portions were large or average with bare minimal to no condiments (butter, jam, maple syrup).

I must of committed the seven deadly sins, at one sitting at Hash House A Go Go.

Greed -- I wanted the largest, most filling, and most popular (as shown on Man vs Food) dish on the menu, so I went with Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. Heads turned from the neighboring tables as this heart stopping beauty dropped in front of me.

Gluttony -- I devoured and consumed and force fed myself until I finished about half of this monstrosity. There was fried chicken, biscuits, scrambled eggs, drowned in a thick gravy. It was a symphony of sin... so bad yet so good... I felt like I was...

Lust -- making love to this dish. Oh so, wrong... What happens in Vegas, stays...

Sloth -- Zzzzz... food coma.... wake me up before you go-go.

Envy -- Kudos to the people who can finish this in one sitting. Vegas is awesome!! I can't think of a spot in the bay area that would dare serve something like this.

Pride -- Asian pride!! I'm taking this sucka to go!! Doggy baggin it!!

Wrath -- On reflection... what the heck was I thinking?! I know it was Vegas but I'm sure I had consumed my daily recommended calorie intake in one sitting. Stupid, Stupid... Grrrrrrr....

I expected a lot from this restaurant, because up to this point, I had enjoyed all of the restaurants on the strip that I had been finding using Yelp. I trusted the reviews. That's why I left more disappointed than usual.
The portions here are, for lack of a better word, revolting. Even an entree that is seemingly for a single person is still just a little too much food for a couple.
Perhaps this wouldn't be as bad if I didn't look out and see all of the food that was wasted at each table during the course of our meal. People ordered one entree each, leaving entire plates untouched because they either didn't like the food or couldn't finish it.
Most likely, they didn't like it. My boyfriend and I shared the Andy's Fried Chicken special, and it came with a heaping amount of sauce, covering a huge piece of oddly fried chicken, a huge biscuit, and a small mound of hash browns. It didn't look appetizing--it looked like someone had thrown up on what our order was perhaps supposed to look like. To make matters worse, they tried to decorate the plate by sticking what we could only guess were uncooked noodles--yes, uncooked pieces of wheat spaghetti--into various holes, sticking rosemary in the top, and dropping spots of a liquid (with the color and consistency of grease) around the rim of the plate.
WTF
We pulled out all of the needless 'decor' and tried to enjoy our meal, but we couldn't. The chicken breading tasted and felt weird, and it was probably over-fried. The biscuit was a little dry, but probably one of the least disappointing aspects of this entree. It also came with hash browns and a few pieces of fruit, which was definitely the least disappointing.

Fellow Yelpers, I feel slightly betrayed. Normally you are so on target, but this is a place that does not at all stand up to the hype. 

This place is at the back of The Linq, formerly Imperial Palace, and the reviews had me wanting to check it out. I knew something was off however as soon as I got to the escalator and there were 60 or so people waiting to get a table. We spoke with the hostess and were informed of a 1.25 hour wait. 

We were hungry, but not one to shy away from adversity, we stuck it out. After 32 min we were called and shown to a booth. That was the last time I can call something a positive. The booth itself was oversized. I am a 6' male with a tall torso, and the table top was just below the center of my chest. This made for a very uncomfortable meal as I had to lean up and forward just to get to the table. 

Any benefit we had from getting the table faster evaporated while waiting for our server. That was another 15 min. I ordered a flapjack with eggs and bacon and my wife ordered a chorizo hash. When the food came, it was ""ok.""  Certainly not bad, but just ok. The portions were massive. No way a single person could finish unless they were in some competition with themselves or others. 
We finished up and got out as soon as we could due to realizing that the cigarette smoke from the casino pretty much drafts up throughout the entire restaurant. 
This place may be good for hangover food. The portions are massive, but it is really nothing special about it. You can get the same food experience at Denny's on the Strip and not pay a premium for being in a theme.

First of all, the imperial palace is soooo outdated. The parking structure to the casino was a trip all on its own, and once we got to the casino, while we kept seeing the hash house a go go signs, we couldn't find it.

Alas, we asked the security guard who told us to go to the middle of the casino (I hate these half ass directions btw) and walk up the escalators. While I may have looked at him little crazy, indeed you have to find the center of the casino, and you'll find the escalators to the restaurant.

Unlike the San Diego's earth friendly, clean, crowded atmosphere, this one was much like the Imperial palace. Smoky and empty.

don't get me wrong. the service was great. Though I wish the guy would stop winking, and if he has a twitch, my bad playa... my bad.

I got the pork katsu with the burger buns and my co workers got different plates. Of course none of us were ever able to finish our plate, and it was delicious.  I just wish that Hash House A Go Go would've thought twice about their locations in vegas.",0,0,0

We were told about this place by a friend in California and boy were we glad.  It was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  The food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was EXCELLENT (I forgot her name though).  She was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  All four of us were happy were our selections.  I ordered the Hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when I ordered a side of the Chipotle sauce from the Andy's Man vs food dish it was perfect.  I asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  We also ordered the ""Andy's Man Vs Food"" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with biscuits, mashed potatoes, angel hair pasta, fried chicken, bacon and more.  Our friends got the Mango Coconut pancake and also the French toast and they absolutely loved both dishes.  The coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  I think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.

Hash House A Go Go is located inside the LINQ Hotel, which was a bit of a hike from where my boyfriend and I were staying, but we are huge breakfast lovers and thus had to stop by. 

By the time we arrived at around 11:30 AM, the wait for 2 was already up to 1.5 hours. Luckily, we were able to entertain ourselves at the tables. The pub inside the LINQ is also a lot of fun and offers beer pong, if you're looking to kill time with a large group. There's also a Kitson just next door which is fun for browsing for unique gifts.

The wait ended up only being 1 hour - fortunately we decided to head back to Hash House earlier than our quoted wait time and our number was called within 5 minutes... so be aware! 

The menu is very reasonably priced considering the portions are HUGE. If you order the specialty chicken and waffles, be prepared to eat that for several meals or make the smarter decision to share. The pancakes are 14 inches across in diameter... my boyfriend and I could barely finish off half of one, but we did also each get our own entrees. 

After placing our orders, it took approx. 30 minutes to get our food, which is frankly a little ridiculous for breakfast food.... even at a busy place. When the food did finally arrive, it looked and tasted delicious! I ordered ""The Basic"" which is your standard breakfast spread of farm potatoes, scrambled eggs, and your choice of meat. The eggs were perfectly cooked and, again, everything was well-portioned. 

Wait time aside, Hash House is a great choice for breakfast and worth a stop by when in Vegas!",1,0,0

8\/6\/2017 Edit: Thank you Brannon R. of Hash House A Go Go for responding regarding lack of flavor.  If you are looking to improve, regarding the burger,  season the patty with anything -- coriander, salt, pepper, anything... that would be my suggestion.    My burger had 4 main items.  sliced tomato, lettuce, ground beef, and mashed potato.  All four of these items felt completely unseasoned.   Grilling ground beef straight up on a flattop provides a pretty gritty flavor,  in addition to the loads of butter on the bun (which was crisp).

I decided to go light (or what I thought would be light) so I ordered 1 single flapjack and a biscuit with gravy. 

While we waited for our food, we order Bloody Mary's and Tangerine Mimosas. They were delicious and full of flavor, but be prepared to spend $8.50-9.50 on each drink. 

When our food came out, everyone in the restaurant's jaw dropped to the ground. It was GIGANTIC! Honestly, I don't even know what was exactly on each of the guy's plates. But it was a mountainous pile with a knife stick out of it. The plates themselves are about the size of 4-5 dinner plates! 

Then I was handed my pancake plate...oh my gosh! It was 16 inches round and as fluffy as a chocolate cake! I was hoping they forgot the biscuit because there is no way I would be able to eat all that. 

In the end, none of the guys finished their meal although they tried. It was recommended by the waitress to not eat the biscuit or mash potatoes and you should be able to finish it (isn't that really NOT finishing it?). I split for my pancake into fourths and gave each guy a slice. I didn't even finish my slice. Everyone loved the pancake- I don't think I have ever had a better pancake and especially not at a restaurant. 

We were told the pancake at dinner time is 5x larger than the breakfast pancake. I can't even imagine. 

I would recommend it to anyone, as the food was good and it was full of laughter and fun. It is something you have to try at least once.",0,0,0

My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait.

The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. 

Portions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.

It was around 11am and there wasn't too much of a wait, and we got seated within 15 minutes. It was a little confusing to get to, but after a bit of directions from the concierge, we figured it out. Most of the complaints about this place stemmed from the wait, but I guess you just have to know when to go.

Anyways, we had heard of the huge portions at Hash House a Go Go, but you really don't understand how big it is until you see it in person. I got the sage fried chicken with the bacon waffle stack, and it was enormous. A kid at the neighboring table got the same thing, and it was as big as his head. I eat a lot, and I was not able to finish it. Thankfully, our hotel room had a full kitchen, so we could store and re-heat everything we didn't eat. 

The fried chicken was on point, and the waffles, albeit a little soggy after awhile, were delicious. There are a lot of other fried chicken dishes, like the benedict, so you can't really go wrong.  I was also able to try the chorizo hash, which packed a good punch, and the pork tenderloin sandwich, which also was humongous. Biscuits were buttery and not overly dry and the gravy was pretty peppery and flavorful.

We said we gotta have that so scratch relaxing breakfast in comfy bed and off we go.
This Hash House is located in the Imperial Palace Hotel, which is really hard to find parking in.  So we finally park and find ourselves finally in the hotel and start looking for the place.  We went around in circles, probably like 4 times.  Kept seeing the advertisement for Hash but no clear directions to the restaurant. 
Finally we decide to walk through the Casino, I ask one of the workers where it is, she isn't very friendly but tells me some general directions through her teeth, which in the end didn't even help us! GRRR
Anywho, we go up the wrong escalator go back down and then i see a sign that sees go to the middle of the casino, so there we go and we finally go up the escalator and make it to our destination...YAY!! I was hungry!

Our waitress was also very friendly, professional and helpful, especially considering how packed it gets. They should both be commended for that, as well as management. 

Now, on to the constructive criticism: The food. I have to say, when the food came, I was very happy with the presentation, as it looked gorgeous and was very pretty. I have included a picture of our meals to illustrate this point. The disappointment came when I took my first bite and the taste did not match the presentation. I found a meal incredibly bland and flavorless... although I have to give credit where credit is due and say that the biscuit was wonderful. But in a full large meal, it's unfortunate that the biscuit was the best part. I feel that with Vegas being so competitive as far as restaurants, they need to re-assess their offerings, although maybe it was just my specific meal... I don't know.

I also ordered the sausage which was flavorful and bit spicy, scrambled eggs which were nice and creamy, and the apple pancake, which was big enough to keep a newborn child warm at night as a blanket. However, the apple pancake wasn't very ""apple-y"". It had some thin strips of apple in it, but didn't taste like apple. What would have really helped is sort of like an apple-pie-ish apple in there --- seasoned with lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter. Instead it was just kind of a regular pancake, which was good, but I paid a few dollars extra to make it a special ""apple"" pancake. Wasn't worth the upgrade.

That's sort of where they're missing out on that 5th star. Needed more gravy with my biscuit and needed more apple flavor with my apple pancake upgrade. That said, the pancake itself was the PERFECT texture --- springy without being rubbery...moist without being goopy.

While there were a lot of great things there were a few areas for improvement I identified.  Any place that has an assortment of mimosas flavors gets my vote I had the option of tangerine, pineapple, Apple and I can't even remember the rest I was pleasantly overwhelmed.  Speaking of overwhelmed the portion sizes here are out of this world you definitely get what you pay for here it's amazing to see what comes from the kitchen.  I only went to get a nibble so I got a couple of sides, a side of bacon, biscuits and gravy, and a side of crispy fried potatoes.  I like my bacon crispy not burnt a room for improvement include being able to decipher between the two while my bacon wasn't completely burned and edible it was crisper than I usually prefer. The biscuit was not as soft as I like and surprising as things normally smothered in a gravy such as biscuits and gravy tend to be on the soft side, but not mine. The crispy potatoes were awesome the only thing that could have made them top notch would have been to add onions and peppers to them.

I've had the bacon avocado burger before and the corned beef hash and I've never been disappointed with the food. This time I had the grilled cheese which they spruce up with bacon and tomato. Perfect! Definitely the best place to go for drunk food or hangover food. It is a little heavy though if you're looking for something lighter. 

Service is ok nothing spectacular but not bad. The linq location is usually busier than some of the others so expect less interaction with your server. This time the server dropped the bill right when we got the food so it seemed kind of rushed. When I went to pay for my $16 check I left a $20 and asked for change back. She forgot to bring it and when I said it's ok take your time she only heard it's ok and thought I meant keep the change which is fine but I feel like she forced me to tip her extra for average service. Not a huge deal I let her keep it. Just a little uncomfortable

If you would like to see just how high your food can stack up, I'd recommend the sage fried chicken with waffles (not in the benedict form or the one with a side of biscuits), which you most certainly must disassemble or else your fried goods and buttery waffles of a tower will come tumbling down.

None of us in our party tried each other's food, to be honest, because we were entirely famished by the time we got seated, placed our orders, and saw those saucer plates come at us. Forks were in, mouths were a gobbling as soon as our own plates touched down. I can, however, tell you all about the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and spinach hash, which came with the aforementioned fist-size biscuit, a slice of watermelon and cantaloupe, and 2 over easy eggs (your choice of how you want those babies done).

The hash wasn't a ""hash brown"" (think McD's or Denny's versions) as what I had pictured in my mind. They were the pan-fried type, cut not in thin slices and pieced together as one but thick cuts of diced potato (triangle shaped?) that was not that crispy, especially after sitting at the bottom of everything else on that plate. I was potatoed out after a few bites of my dish (it wasn't like french fries where you can keep going and going..). The toppings were stir-fryed well (i really liked the tartness of the sundried tomato that made the other flavors pop), and lucky for me, there were lots of artichoke hearts. The eggs were buttery and the yolks, which smoothly burst through the whites by the forkful, were perfectly aromatic. The biscuit was soft and fluffy, easily pried open. My gluttonous self would have asked for more butter and jelly if I could, but the waiter took awhile to make it over to our table.

I'm not all that intrigued with ginormous portions, but if I were to venture back, I'd go for the tower of chicken and waffles, one of the gravy dishes, or perhaps a sandwich concoction. I wish their potatoes were more interesting.

PS: The house brewed coffee should not be underestimated. It was smooth, crisp, and light to medium bodied. Perfect breakfast blend.",3,2,3

Don't get me wrong, it's tasty. Pile fried chicken and scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy and bacon AND CHEESE on mashed potatoes, and it's gonna taste good.

Same with bananas and brown sugar in a pancake.

The portions are HUGE and the prices are low (by major city standards), so it's easy to understand why people like it here.

I gave 3 stars for 2 reasons, neither of which having to do with taste:

1) the location is depressing. It's dark and crammed at the top of an escalator in the Quad (former Imperial Palace), and has zero ambiance. Not that one would expect romance, but it's really just sad and weird and ugly.

There's no bathroom in the restaurant (or so I was told by the hostess), so if the feeling strikes you, prepare for another trip back down the escalator and into the casino.

My buddy got the hamburger, which he raved about. Our other buddy ordered some sort of chicken dish, but had to leave suddenly when all the free booze from the casinos caught up with him. We attempted to eat his dish, but we couldn't make it. 
The food was filling and delicious, and the fresh herbs were certainly appreciated. 
Out of the entire trip to Vegas, this was probably the culinary highlight of the whole trip. 
It can be a bit difficult to find this place, as it's tucked in the rear of the Linq Casino, but ask enough slot jockeys, and they'll point you in the right direction. 
I encourage you to check this place out.",9,5,6

Lets just say it was the perfect place for that. We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. We shared and honestly it was a lot of food. You can't help and look around at all the meals while waiting for your food they are HUGE. The best part of the meal was the chicken whichhad stuffing, it was really flavorful. The waffles on the other hand we're ok. We also split a house salad with cucumber dressing. The dressing was pretty good. Overall I think this place is about the presentation and how BIG the items are.

With a name like Hash House, you certainly can't go wrong with their traditional hashes, but the thing to try is the chicken and waffles. Giant pieces of crispy fried chicken atop fluffy sage waffles drizzled with maple syrup. The enormous plate comes with a giant steak knife stabbed right in the middle -- it doesn't get much more epic than that. If you manage to finish this plate by yourself, I bow down to you. I scruffed through barely half of it, and I was already ready to roll back down the escalator in a food coma.

I went to Vegas for the weekend, and my family had me and my younger sister go ahead of them to grab a table at Hash House A Go Go for 7 people. I have been there numerous times and never experienced this issue before. The service is wonderful here, the food is delicious. They are big plates. It all started when the host asked me 
""how many people""? I said ""7"". He said it will be a moment to set up the table. He passed me off to another woman to sit us down and as I was waiting she began to sit other people down. She ignored me and sat everyone else down. I then began to say ""excuse me, why aren't we being seated?"" She then responds to me ""I need at least half of the party here before I could seat you down, but I could give you a table for two"". I then got frustrated and called my mom to get down to the restaurant. In all my life I have never experienced an issue of having to have half the party there. Right off the bat it wasn't needing half the party there, the lady wasn't taking me seriously due to my young face and small size. I am 20. I then had my mom come and as my mom was speaking to her about why we can't have a table for 7 and why do we need half the party she said she will go get the manager, she however never got the manager she instead sat us down about 10 minutes later and never came back to our section that we were seated at. It is complete and utter bullshit that I cannot be taken seriously. In all my life at going to a restaurant and requesting a table for a large party before has never been an issue for me. I felt hurt and upset for being treated as if I was a child. This restaurant again is extremely delicious, and the service is wonderful. I give it five stars but sadly a horrible hostess who had to be rude and disgusting and ruin some of the experience. I recommend training the host\/hostess on proper customer etiquette.",0,0,0

This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.

Style over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go ""wow!"" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.

That's all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I'll just say that the size (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. 

I also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#SBNu2x4ogGJkvRJ5spQLRA), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I've ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey's chocolate syrup in my face.",12,11,13

I was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. We were staying at the Flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. There were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. The remaining 4 decided we would wait; you only get to Vegas so often; right? We waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. Everything is okay so far. The menu looked fantastic and I had already made up my mind I was having the chicken and waffles. I could not wait!! We ordered coffees and water and then our meals. The menu states clearly ""please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare""; I am more than okay with this. I am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. This is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. Our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. We asked for refills on coffee; after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. She said that she had some brewing. Okay, no problem. Two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. After another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. She says ""sure!"" as if the previous request never happened. Several minutes later the coffee finally came. Water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. Same with the coffee. This went on for 40-45 mins while waiting for food. The food finally started to come out. First was my wife's pancake. A couple of minutes later the french toast came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the BLT that was ordered; sans the fries. Then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. Now as I stated I am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food; but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. So, we all start to dig in. My wife's pancake is huge and looks great. They gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of Texas. No problem; just ask for more. We had to ask again after it never came. My dining companions were enjoying the french toast and the BLT. Still no fries. I was taking on the chicken and waffles. They did not come with any syrup. They did come with a ""maple reduction sauce"" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. The waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. Asked for syrup again. Waited. It finally came. My friend was done with the BLT. No fries...asked for them and they finally came out. Asked for more coffee and water. Waited. Finally got it. So as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. My friend Mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. The manager apologized and left. A few minutes later Mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said ""I'm a letter writer"". The manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his BLT and the drinks off of the bill. Smart move. Took a little prodding but it was a smart move. We could not wait to pay and get out. I would not make the effort to go back. My new name for this place is ""Hash House A No Go"" and I will leave it at that. Good day now!",4,1,1

Service - the service was outstanding, our waitress Abbey was attentive and got our refills immediately

Bathroom is downstairs in the casino, it's a long walk so I suggest going before or after 

Giving this a 3 star because the food wasn't as good as the hype made it seem to be. If the chicken was more tender and flavorful I'd give it 5 star",0,0,0

On my first visit (May, 2012), I had no idea what to expect, with the word 'Hash' in the name one is led to believe hash browns would be involved, when in fact, nothing comes with hash browns.  My friends ordered one of the large fried chicken 'breakfasts', I wasnt in the mood for a giant meal, so I ordered 'Andys Famous Bread Pudding', which comes with coffee @ $8.95, it was more than I could finish, and ok, I'd call this the 'value play' on the menu here, everything else is gonna wring your wallet.
2nd trip, we again visited the IP location on a Monday morning; driving into the IP location at this particular time (10\/22\/12) is INSANE with the construction going on, and their parking garage is deplorable.  The wait was crazy long, luckily the beepers they give you work immediately downstairs where we could play video poker at the bar and drink 'free' coffees.
When we got back upstairs to the waiting area, they called out our name instead of using the beepers (?).
The decor here is farmer-full-metal-jacket, with plate metal on the walls.  I think this creates sort of a Faraday cage where no cell signal attempting to transmit Yelp Checkins or Photos is possible! :) Both times here checkins\/photos failed to go thru.
Waiter was fairly attentive, after we ordered he then warned us the kitchen was very slow and orders were running 30-40 mins.  Oh goody.  I ordered the 'steak hash' and a V8.  Wife got bacon\/eggs and coffee.
Steak hash, with sun dried tomatoes and topped with green beans and potatoes, along with two eggs on the side, came served in a faux iron skillet (meaning, it wasnt used to cook in).  Sometimes I think chefs add sexy ingredients that are going to sound good, without really thinking thru the flavor.  It was really quite dreary tasting and unappetizing, and the steak was overcooked slices of beef.
After tip we were out $40 for breakfast that I really didnt enjoy much.  
So the two-star here is mainly due to the value, my opinion is overpriced 'just ok' food.

- Felt rushed (our first time and the menu is huge)

- They charge for a side of ranch ($1.29)

- We told our waitress we wanted to keep the menu to order more later and before we finished our 1 dish, she already put the check on the table. I felt like she wanted us to leave so we did cause we didn't want to dine\/spend our money in that kind of atmosphere.

This place really let me down. 
After seeing pics of the monster size proportions I was geared up for a hearty breakfast. Well take note that if you order the famous Chicken n Waffles, they will come out in about 15min. But everyone else will wait 40 for their food, so I assume chicken n waffles are pre-made and not ""farm-fresh made to order"" like they claim.

1) We waited 20 min for a table.
2) We waited 40 minutes for our food.
3) My omelet came out wrong\/burnt\/bland.
4) Potatoes were cold and dry.
5) Tables are high but your chairs are low, which makes for really awkward seating. Feels like you need a booster seat. 
6) Service is slow and bad. 

I could tell others were getting pissed off waiting for their food as well. 
Everyone in there looked irritated and ready to stab the waiters with a fork.

I'll avoid this place on future Vegas trips.",3,1,0

Had to wait one hour and when we returned after checking out some slots for about 50 minutes, we found out they called our name just a few minutes earlier. This resulted in about ANOTHER  35 minute wait. Ridiculous. Our waitress seemed nice at first and progressively got less and less helpful. Orders we taken wrong, eggs prepared the wrong way. We asked for a correction and the food had to literally be re- prepared from scratch. I asked the waitress if my meal would have the same amount of chicken as the other chicken dishes and she assured me they were the same. When my dish came out i was shocked at how little chicken was in the meal. I asked her about it and she said it was supposed to be that way. What was she talking about just a few moments earlier, then?! We even asked for the manager because the experience was just that bad. The manager came by asked what was wrong. Mumbled something about getting that issue taken care of. And never heard an apology from him or the waitress. In fact we hardly ever saw him or the waitress again. Not til the meal was over. Wow. We pretty much lost our appetite just from the service alone but the lack of taste and quality in the food didn't help either. Then to top it off, a huge gnat landed and was crawling around one of our biscuits. Yummy. Yeah it's safe to say I regretted going to this place. The food was bland, carb heavy and cold. I think even IHOP or Denny's wouldve tasted better at the same price. I'm sure this isn't going to deter or impact the demand since there are so many rave reviews but my experience does not reflect the majority, sadly. I will definitely be calling their customer satisfaction line if they have one.

First off, the service in a word - Sucked!! There were no smiles well of course if you count the 17yr old bus boy flirting with me... It took forever for our waitress to take our order and just as long for her to bring us our drinks. For about 8 minutes there were actually no employees to be seen out on the floor, all us customers were just looking around hoping an employee appears...
The place is alot smaller than what I thought it would be, anyhow  we thought the food was good. On the table was the cheeseburger,chicken sandwich,grilled chicken breast over mashed potatoes, polenta & w\/grilled carrots (I LOVE CARROTS!!!), and the crab cakes with potatoes & veggies.

I mean, holy crap is it a large portion. I realize they have a ""man vs food"" item, but honestly, it could all be ""stomach vs food"" entrees. 

But the real test is, is it good? And I can happily say it is! Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my main entree wasn't my favorite. But let me explain. Not realizing how large the portions were, I ordered the salmon and cream cheese hash, with me and my mom splitting the brown sugar and banana pancakes. To be honest, I really wanted the pancake, but I always feel guilty not getting a little protein in my meal. So I went with the ""healthy"" (I know, it's laughable) salmon dish. 

The salmon was a bit dry and I didn't really like the whole mix of salmon, cream cheese and hash. My mom ordered the mushroom hash, which I, of course, tried. It was much better! But the pancake was AWESOME! I should have just sucked up my pride and just ordered that. It's honestly one massive pancake, that would have equaled three medium sized ones. It was one of the best I've ever had! 

I liked the fact that while you waited they have a sole bar dedicated to bloody mary's! And they are gooooood! I swear, I'd come up there just to get a bloody mary and head back down and go about my day. It was one of the best I've ever had, packed with olives, pickles and a bean! Plus, it was the right amount of spice. 

Speaking of waiting. You will wait. And wait. And Wait. We waited an hour to sit and then another hour for food. We came around 10am on a Sunday, which I'm sure is prime brunch time. I'd highly suggest going in later, but you'll probably always have a wait here. It was worth it though!",6,4,4

I asked for my eggs over medium... they came out cold and runny and I could not eat them.  The salmon was cold... was it supposed to be?  The skillet came with a lump of cheese on one side, the rest had little to none so they did not do a good job of ""mixing it up"".

Amazing breakfast is had here. 

I was really excited to eat somewhere other than Subway at Vegas this time around... and the Hash House a Go Go definitely provides a bang for your buck (which is critical when doing Vegas on a budget like I am).
But who am I kidding? I didn't even pay for this meal! A good friend did (and that right there IS the ultimate best way to do Vegas on a budget!). 

Got the HH Original Benedict but veggie style, so without the smoked bacon (got asparagus on the side instead).  The roasted red pepper cream it came with was absolutely Uh-mazing! As were the griddled mashed potatoes! 

Almost couldn't finish my meal, the plate was so large! Be prepared to get a to-go box and eat the rest after when you're good and drunk :)

The service was a bit on the slow side... but it was Vegas on a Saturday morning. A tip would be to come an hour before you actually want to eat and then go gamble downstairs while you wait for a table.
 
Also... i gotta say that the Entrance to the Imperial Palace from the strip is harder to find than one would think. There's some stores and a restaurant in the front that actually obstruct the casino entrance behind.

The portions are RIDICULOUS for the price. We could have easily split the burger and been full off of that, but seriously where's the fun in that? When in Sin City, gluttony is a must! 

The drinks were sooooo good. I'd say maybe, too good. You could barely taste the alcohol so theyre definitely the kind of drinks that sneak up on you. 

The sage fried chicken eggs benedict is literally one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. The chicken was perfectly fried and full of flavor. The biscuit was nice and fluffy.

we also ordered the fries. i don't know what was in the seasoning, but it was bomb! :) 

i tried a bunch of different dishes as well (to help my friends out... obvi!). the quesadilla, which was probably the size of 4 normal ones, was stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs and tomato. super flavorful and spicy. the sausage gravy pot pie looked nothing like a pot pie and overly rich with taste. the dish came with a ginormous piece of fried tortilla chip that looked like an upside down sombrero. i think that was the ""crust"" of the pot pie. the sausage gravy stuff was on top, and we realized later on that the huge mound of mashed potatoes was hiding under the sombrero chip.

I really enjoyed how crunchy the batter was. The waffles had bacon in them. Who doesn't like that? Seriously it was a wonderful, flavorful, exciting meal. We were so full that we didn't eat again until dinner time. My fellow diners all enjoyed their meals except for the corned beef hash. I was told that was less then good but not terrible. 

The bloody mary's are incredible as well, served with a large piece of bacon, it's a meal on it's own. Go now, do not pass go. Eat here!",4,0,2

A place where you will endure a wait time equal to the time you will wait at the DMV, so be prepared to do a lot of standing if you can't find one of their 20 or so spots to sit.  Bottom line, this place gets PACKED!  We were told a table for 2 would be a 45-60 minute wait, but it wasn't that long, probably 30ish minutes, so not that bad, but if you come with a group, you'll be waiting much, much longer during peak meal times.  Once sat, we were greeted very quickly and noticed the meals coming out were HUGE!!!  You will not leave this place hungry!  This is where I am stuck between 3 and 4 stars, so let me get to what we ordered and my druthers next.   My wife ordered their Crab Cake Farm Benedict and like I said, the portion was enough to feed a small army, served over a mountain of griddled mashed potatoes and a split biscuit, with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chipotle cream and two basted eggs.  I ordered one of their, what I assume is a signature meal of theirs, House Hashes, served with Corned Beef, red onions, and Swiss cheese; tossed with crispy potatoes & topped with 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit.  Both portions were too much to finish.

Now, this is why I give three stars..  It took forever to get our food.  I know it's busy, but we waited close to 30 minutes before our food was brought to us.  The crab cake on my wife's meal was not hot at all.  My ""crispy potatoes"" were no where's near crispy and again, not very hot.  The presentation of the meals was very good, but would have been much better if they were served hot.  You are also sort of ""rushed"", as you're given your bill well before you're even close to be done with your food.  One table I observed was even asked if they were done with their food when it was pretty obvious, they weren't close and still had their forks in their hands!  Let me end this rant by saying our server was very pleasant and courteous.   

All meals served here will make you add a notch to your belt and if you leave here hungry, something is terribly wrong with your appetite.  The prices are a bit on the higher side than you'd expect to pay for breakfast, but they make up for that in the amount of food you get.  It's a check in the box, and don't think we'd be back, but the food, if served hot and fresh, is very good - just get ready to make breakfast a 90+ minute ordeal.",18,12,14

I must say I'm really quite sad to write this review as this was once one of my favorite spots on the strip, but I will not be returning.

I was visiting Vegas along with a group of 6 people.  I'm currently 10 weeks pregnant with twins, so while they decided to walk to the restaurant, I hopped a cab because I wasn't feeling too well and was in a hurry to get some food in my stomach.  I figured I'd arrive 15 mins early and be able to get a table and get my food order in immediately. 

Once I arrived, the place was dead (it was about 9:30 pm), so I asked to be seated at a table for 6.  The hostess informed me that she was unable to seat me without the remainder of my party.  I was quite surprised as the majority of the tables were empty.  I explained that I am pregnant and experiencing morning sickness which worsens as I get hungry, could they please make an exception and seat me.  No, nothing she could do.   

At this time, I started dry heaving.  Now there is not a bathroom in this place, you have to go down and through the casino in order to find one, so I grabbed the garbage can from the hostess station and sat down.  I asked the hostess if I could at least get a sprite right now to calm my stomach?  She pointed to the bar and said, yeah, go ahead.   I was shocked that with NOTHING TO DO, she didn't even offer to go and retrieve it for me!!!   I rushed back to the bar and ordered my sprite (which they made me pay for at that time, instead of just tacking it onto my dinner bill - kind of unussual...) and sat back down to continue heaving.  

As the dry heaving continued, I asked the hostess if I could put a food order in from the lobby.   No, not until you're seated (but of course they wouldn't seat me).  When the dry heaving continued, I asked her to bring me out a biscuit (they give these out for free with dinner)  which thankfully, she did and I was able to wolf that down and my stomach started to settle.    

Shortly after that, my party arrived.  They alerted the hostess, who then spent another 10 minutes readying the table (seriously?!)  and finally sat us.   I immediately ordered some food and asked the waiter to rush it.  While the rest of the group looked over the menu.   While we waited, I began to feel sick again.  I went over and grabbed a small trash can and brought it under our table, just in case because the distance to the bathroom was quite far.   

A minute or so after sitting back down, the manager, Shawn, walks up to the table ""I'm sympathetic to your situation, but I can't have this here""   I assumed he meant the trash can, so I said ""Ok, maybe you could bring me a bowl just in case?""   ""No Ma'am, I mean YOU; you need to leave.  I just can't have you in my restaurant, it's disturbing to other patrons""  My jaw completely dropped - for one thing, there was no one else around us!   For another, I hadn't actually thrown up a single time and hadn't even gagged while seated at the table!!  I was completely confused - ""the rest of your party is welcome to stay, but I'm going to have to have to ask you to leave""   At this point I felt terrible and burst in to tears begging him to ""please just pack up my food, I need to eat before I faint!  I need to eat!  Please!""  At first he refused, but I think as the tears were flowing, he started to get a little embarrassed.  He went back into the kitchen and brought back a small plate of corned beef, dropped it at the table and then rushed away.   

As I wolfed down my food between tears, the waiter returned and we asked him to send over another manager as we were pretty horrified with the treatment.    A female manager returned.  She did not apologize for the behavior or the other manager, but did say ""if you'd like to stay, you can stay""  But honestly at this point, we weren't willing to patronize the place anymore.  

So she brings back the BILL.   ""you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!""   ""well Ma'am, you DID eat it""   I should have walked out, but I was very upset and just handed her my credit card - $10 for by biscuit, soda, and a handful of corned beef.    

We made a complaint to the hotel manager (The Quad) and although she was very nice and understanding, she stated that they did not have an affiliation with the restaurant and there really was nothing that she could do about how they ran their business.  

Sadly, I won't ever be returning.  The lack of any empathy from the staff is ridiculous.  With so many wonderful places on the strip and every other experience this trip great customer service, this place won't ever make the cut again.",3,0,0

Phenomenal, massive, wasteful, absurd, delicious. I've been here a handful of times & have always ordered the same thing - the chicken & waffles, naturally. 

Actually, this seems not to be on their menu anymore, based on their website, which is devastating. I hope I'm wrong about it. Their sage-fried chicken is some of the crispiest, juiciest, most flavorful fried chicken I've ever had, & their servers have always been kind enough to let me order it with two boneless chicken breasts instead of a bone-in whatever-other-part they usually serve. The waffle is HUGE & fluffy, with bacon baked into it, right in the batter. Together, topped with real maple syrup, they are a symphony of deliciousness. No joke. No exaggeration. This was the first place I ever ate chicken & waffles, & it's basically ruined me on any other chicken & waffles forever.

Hash House A Go Go ( probably the only reason you would go inside Imperial Palace) in a certain way does live up to the hype.

Expect a hour wait when you get there. The portions are HUGE, and even though it is pricey, you would pay the same amount for a buffet, for roughly the same amount of food that an average person could eat.

Biggest Recommendation for First timers:
Get: the ANDY'S Sage Fried Chicken ( This is Benedict with the light orange sauce on top of it)...there are so many flavors thrown, the sweet of the biscuits, to the salty of the friend chicken and bacon, to the savory of the sauce on top, with the cheese and tomatoes make for a great meal.

Do Not Get: regular Sage Fried Chicken (Waffles on  top of fried chicken)...yes it might taste god, but this was somewhat of a let down...This to me was too regular.

Hash House a Go Go is twisted farm food. It is great comfort food, but be reasonable with your expectations. I certainly was!",0,0,0

I usually don't do the carb, but I did because it looked and smelled good. They were nice enough to give egg whites, no subs tho.

Fruits could of been better instead of a slice of cantelop and a slice of something else. I think the bacon waffle could of been more crispy instead of so plain and white looking. 

The cost was seriously buttered up, so if you like buttered toast, choose that then!

I do like the tea (orange spice and also ordered lemongrass). 

I had to wait forever for the server to come over, at first they said they sat us at a table no server, then turns out that a party of 12 was there so our server was occupied.

We ordered our food and drinks as soon as the waiter came over.  After we ordered, he informed us that since they make everything fresh it would take 30 minutes to get our food.  It was 11:50 and we thought that would give us time to make our next events at 1:20 for three of us and 1:45 for the other two.  At 12:30, 40 mins later, we asked for an update and were again told that the kitchen was busy but we should be coming up soon.  At 12:50 my sister and her family had to leave to get to their event.  So we told the waiter to cancel their order and asked to see the manager.  The manager finally came over with one plate at 1:05 and apologized for the late meals.  We explained that some of us had to leave without eating because of the delay and that we would have to hurry and eat our meal to make our event.  He again apologized and said that that the server should have told us they were behind earlier.  After all this he gave us 25% off our meals.

The only saving grace (hence the 2 star and not 1) was the food.  It was good and there was plenty of it.  However, since we had to rush we really didn't get to enjoy the meal.

The hostess should have told customers of the wait when they put their names on the list.  As we were leaving we heard another person complain that they also had to wait an hour and 20 mins. to get their food.

They turn tables fast and it is very apparent they have a well trained management team and staff. Service was friendly and fast and the delicious food (both flavor and portion) is hands down worth the food coma. I am actually happy that I do not have a HHGG in DC, otherwise I would probably be as fat as I am tall (lol). We had the House Bloody Mary and the Mimosa which did not disappoint. For the entrees we had the Texas Ranchero Benedict and the enormous pancake. Neither one of us were even close to finishing our meal.

On our trip to Vegas, we kept with tradition and decided to go there for breakfast.  We went the same weekend of a college basketball tournament, so the place was packed.  The turnover seemed pretty fast, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Their breakfast menu is intimidating, they have so many tempting options.  One tip, i remember from the past is that their portions are large.  We had been eating out all week, and i just wanted a simple meal.  I ordered the two egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon, and a biscuit.  The whole meal was bad, the only thing that was edible were the eggs.  The 2 measly strips of bacon had every drop of fat rendered out, it was way too crisp.  The potatoes, i did like the addition of the red onions, but they were bland, they needed seasoning. How do you name your self Hash House, and not serve amazing potatoes?   They have a biscuit or toast option, and i was never asked so i assumed they they would bring me toast, instead a very dense biscuit arrived.  My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed.  The banana was simply halved, and still had the peel on.  The melon was peeled but it was segmented into enormous pieces.  I don't think that when you eat out that you yourself should have to prepare you own meal.  Also, i don't know if this is standard or if someone in the kitchen was attempting art, but they smeared blackberries around the rim of the plate, it was very off putting.

Overall, i was very disappointed at the lack of consistency within the restaurant chain.  I really hope that it was just an off day, because i  like what they stand for for and the dishes they are able to put out.",0,0,0

It took us a while to find this place--we had to go on a long adventure through the ""extravagant"" Imperial Palace casino to find this place.  Hash House was packed, which was a good sign. I'm surprised this many people trudged through the casino to actually eat here.

Service was pretty good, although the ice water tasted pretty gross--it was probably just tap water.  Our server was very helpful in taking our orders, since it was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. 

 I ordered the Sage Chicken with a side of crispy potatoes. Man this thing was huge! Two breaded and deep-fried chicken breasts sat atop 2 biscuits, bacon, eggs, cheese, and mashed potatoes, and covered in a chipotle sauce. It was messy, down and dirty, and I felt my arteries clog up with each bite--just the way I like it. You've got to eat this right away, otherwise all it all becomes soggy and not as tasty as it could be. After tackling this heavy meal, the tap water wasn't so bad at all. The Crispy Potatoes weren't that good--they were burned and a little dry. I should've opted for the side of Sausage instead.

Of course, major food coma is to be expected afterwards--the host commented on how slow we were walking. All of us were dragging our feet as we left. Nobody wanted to do anything but just lay around and nap. We ate this meal at around 1pm....9 hours later none of us were hungry yet.",3,1,0

Not sure if the server just wanted a big tip but he wasn't shy with the vodka that is for sure.

it's very casual but they have their own taste. I like the slight rustic feel with the metal sheet tables and wood bottoms.. There was quite a mixture of things going on but honestly I cannot emphasize so much only because after waiting so long I was ready to start reading the menu.

Food:
I am absolutely impressed. 

I ordered the home corned beef with eggs, fried potatoes, which also came with fruit and a huge homemade biscuit (which was bigger than a cosco muffin) they also gave me homemade strawberry jam which was delish. 

When I got the food it was a huge portion two people could eat it or you could share with you little ones. The corned beef was cooked as a brisket and shredded on top of the potatoes topped with peppers and onion. It was flavorful and delicious I can't find any more words.

I did try my friends plate with their homemade mash potatoes which was tasty as well better than mine for sure!!!! And I make some awesome homemade potatoes.


order a side salad with their homemade cucumber ranch dressing it's a different feel it's like eating a salad with cucumbers except there aren't any lol!!

It was a little confusing finding the restaurant.  The Quad is on the strip, but the parking was a little sketchy and once in the casino we had to ask someone where the restaurant was. We were told the wait was 25 minutes, but was seated in less than 10. 

My husband and I shared the Sage Chicken Benedict and the French Toast...MMMMMMM!!! It was a great combo. It was a TON of food, but we justified it by making it brunch and knew we wouldn't have another meal until very late that night. The chicken is tender, the potatoes were delish (my husband loved them), and the chipotle sauce was the perfect topper. The french toast was the best I ever had - perfectly done with pecans and grilled bananas...great combination. I didn't even need maple syrup. 

Our waiter, Scotty, was very friendly and helpful, as was the other waiters I observed. I recommend Hash House a Go Go and suggest sharing a couple dishes.

I wouldn't finish it if I could because it wasn't good. I could not understand the sauce\/gravy on it. It had a sweet undertone and lack salt. The whole meal was salt less and me adding salt, pepper and hot sauce still did not make it flavorful.

I was so excited to have the biscuit so our waiter was kind enough to get me a side of biscuit at no cost. I should have told him to keep it because it was dry and flavorless as well.

Once we were seated, that was when the real wait began. We knew right away what we wanted, since we were staring at the big menu in the waiting area. We split the house smoked salmon benedict and the Snickers pancake, which also came with two eggs. 

Dining at this location is an exercise in patience. We witnessed several impatient parties around us. Our favorite was the hangry lady who complained about the pancake being so large that it was touched the table. The food took almost an hour to get to us. There was no secret why this happened. Scratch-made, slow food takes time and the restaurant was busting at the seams with diners. 

For the amount of volume they experienced that morning, there was no compromise on the quality or taste. Our snickers pancake drooped over the side and touched the table, which I was fully anticipating. My inner fat kid kicked my inner germaphobe in the gut, before going to town on the oversized hotcake. The cakes were fluffy enough to support the chunks of candy. The sugars from the chocolate and nougat caramelized and were ooey and gooey. The side of over easy eggs looked silly in comparison. Everything smelled delicious and we were making the other tables still waiting for their meals jealous. The salmon serving was generous. It was flaky and moist and doused in hollandaise. The biscuit was tender and flaky and absorbed all the flavors cascading from above. 

This was a great dining experience, but it was our first and last visit to this location since learning about the one a couple miles off-strip.",8,6,6

We all came here after playing the daily slot tournament and waiting for the results of the winners (one of us did win the $500!) we found this place in the Imperial Palace and decided to take a break and get some food.  Well thats an understatement! The portions are HUGE and everything was s fresh and yummy.  Its a comfort food joint for sure.  Our lunch consisted of 3 different burgers and one Quesadilla.  The burgers are ""stuffed"" you choose the items you want inside and they pout between the two patties.  One of us had the bacon and mashed potato stuffed burger, one was mushrooms and swiss, and the other bacon, cheddar and avocado.  Only one of us was able to finish the whole burger the other two of us saved 1\/2 for dinner.  The Quesadilla was huge and over flowing and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes which I was told were amazing.  The side of Macaroni and Cheese was said to be the best Mac and Cheese every tasted by 3 in the party so creamy and cheesy it was the ultimate comfort food to drown our gambling losses! LOL  

I recommend this gem which is on the second floor inside Imperial Palace and a reasonable priced place considering the quantity and quality of food you receive. Especially compared to the rest of the places on the strip that leave you broke AND disappointed. 

Only this that would make this place perfect is to get some cell service inside....No AT&T service at all in the restaurant, so if you have others who are gambling or trying to find you, your off the grid in here.....which could be a good thing, you can concentrate on the food-gazm your gonna have!",4,3,5

Its good for the amount of food you're getting but it's bad because of the quality of food. 

So this place i guess got popular due to the T.V show Man vs. Food since the plates are big. That guy loved it because he goes in the kitchen and cooks with chef so the food is fresh therefore he liked it I'm sure. But lets just say ""the food looks better than it tastes""  because the food's quality sucks, it is not fresh and its like cheap buffet style and you can tell that's how its done. I got a hash dish and the patatoes were cold, not crispy and buffet style, so were the veggies placed on top. My husband got the famous dish and the chicken was the same way, not crispy and buffet style kind.

Hash House a Go Go is a must-stop in Vegas - even more so if you're a breakfast lover. Come girded with that true American appetite because the hype, people, is real. 

Their famous Sage-fried Chicken and Waffles lived up to its glowing reputation, and I have to proclaim, it was probably the most memorable dish during my trip to the Strip. 

The presentation: epic...a tower...a Tower of freakin' Epicness. Four bacon-loaded waffles acting as the base, two perfectly fried, golden, crispy chicken breasts laid on top of each other, and to secure this mad chef creation to the plate, skewers of freshly pungent rosemary stalks right down the middle...Impressed yet?

However, do the taste and flavors match the in-your-face presentation? I'm happy to report that it's a resounding yes! The chicken was incredibly moist and juicy. The breading, perfect. Topping it all off with a drizzle of maple syrup creates the perfect marriage between sweet and savory. Can you say match made in food heaven?     

Gripes (I know, I know): The bacon-stuffed waffles were a bit on the dry side. However, they get points for creativity! 

Service and ambiance, however, weren't quite as outstanding. The waitresses were kind of rude and the restaurant can get pretty loud. 

A worthy spot, if you find yourself in the City of Sin. As a suggestion, I would recommend going earlier in the morning to beat the crowds - we arrived at 11 am but still had to wait 45 minutes till we got a table.",19,15,17

While I didn't love my scrambled eggs with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and basil with mashed potatoes and a biscuit, others were raving about their biscuits and gravy and friend chicken. Other disappointments are the soggy toast, not crispy potatoes (even though they are famous for the crispy potatoes), over medium eggs being really runny. The homemade peach jam was delicious. Needless to say no one cleaned their plate. The Bloody Maria was typically 20 oz., very spicy, had a green bean, two olives, and a pickle. Good but not great.

I was by myself so I sat at the bar and was serviced by a pleasant enough spikey hair lady behind the bar. No problems here.

I ordered the chicken and waffles because that's their ""specialty"" and it should fill me up from about 11am til dinnertime.

It arrived quickly in all its visual majesty. It really is an impressive tower. Check out my pic, it's like #250 in the yelp list. Four large waffles topped by a 4 giant pieces of fried chicken. This is going to be awesome I said to myself.

Then, I started eating some of it, and my joy turned to sorrow. Sadly, the fried chicken had no flavor. I don't think I've ever had flavorless fried chicken, but this place somehow pulled it off.

Next, the waffles. There too was a I disappointed. They were really bready and had none of that malty waffle goodness. I had to ask for more syrup just to make the whole thing edible.

We arrived on Thursday at 6:45 AM, with our infant son. (traveling with my husband on business) This was why we were up so early, so yeah we were very tired.  (Unlike the majority of the dining room which was smathered with rogue drunks and dodgy-looking 20 somethings who were there basically because they never went to bed).  I smelled smoke and asked host for non-smoking, evidently it was just leaching in from the casino.  Anyway, there were two ""open"" sections, the bar side and non-bar side. The rest of the dining room was evidently closed, as I was simply told ""that's closed."" when I requested a seat in the back, as we were led directly into the loudest pit of drunks in the dining room by teenage host.  What disturbs me the most is I honestly felt like BECAUSE I requested something, (to be away from the loud\/crazy people), my family was placed directly BY the loud\/crazy people.  I also felt like this incident was a disapproving nod towards the fact that I chose to travel with an infant (GASP!)  in Vegas.  We were placed right NEXT to (within 3 feet of) the loudest, most rowdy gaggle in the entire restaurant. Even the other drunk people seemed to be annoyed by this group. Either the host had some weird superiority complex, or he hadn't even the faintest idea how to BE a host. You are a HOST!!  Your job description is to make guests feel comfortable. It's what you do.  It looked like it might have been his first job, but if that was the case, why the attitude? 

So then we tried to move.  First, we protested to host directly a second time when we arrived at our table. (Could we possibly go to the more quiet -bar side-of the dining room?).  He shook his head, and made some crappy excuse about servers and turns, then disappeared. I've spent over 20 years in the hospitality industry. This was inappropriate. My husband kept saying ""Let's just go"", but I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles, (my jam) and I was starving.  So we asked again, this time to a waiter passing by. Waiter was very friendly, but it was so loud (again the riff raff) he literally could NOT HEAR ME.  I gestured to our son trying to explain we needed a different seat, and he thought we were just showing him our baby!!  Finally as a last ditch attempt, I literally got up and found yet another employee to ask, again a server (no manager in sight). He replied with ""yeah, basically my whole section is drunk"", then finally took action and asked bartender if we could sit on her side.  Over saunters boy host, butting in as he sees me trying to escape our assigned seats, yet again. I kid you not. He THEN directed us to sit at a table on the OTHER SIDE of the drunks we were trying to escape from!!  There were open tables ALL OVER the bar section. It didn't matter where we sat, the bartender was serving everyone in her section. My husband was in disbelief.  I was fed up, and told host ""no way"" this time, and we promptly sat at the next table over. What was this guys problem? How very rude.  Chicken was delish and then waffles were hard and ice cold, such a bummer, when you're spending 50 bones on breakfast. Would have wrote the incident off as me being over-sensitive and host being ""out to lunch"", but then he looked up and ignored us, continuing a casual conversation with the girl at the front counter as we left.

Comes back to apologize that unfortunately the discount ONLY applies to the Active Duty member. NOT to spouses or veterans. FYI, we serve too. But the kicker and ultimate spoiler of the day was that 2 of our party were widows of military members who died while serving our nation. What these ladies wouldn't give to have their husbands there with them to be able to show their ID card to get said discount. After they broke down in tears at the slap in the face reminder, we spoke with the manager whose first words were to defend the policy stating it was not his decision but the owners. Begrudgingly he offered to give us the discount anyway but we'd already paid our bill. If we'd complained about the food I'm sure as the manager he'd have had no problem comping our meal or taking the item off the bill but God forbid we get a 10% discount for serving as a military spouse. Only 1% of the US population serves in the military. I don't think offering a military discount to ALL who serve would break the bank, especially considering the cost of the meal.

Okay, I think that about covers it for this review. My work here is done. Moving on....

Oh, you want more? Okay, my brother-in-law saw this on Man Vs. Food and insisted that we try it. And we did. And there is no way on earth any mere mortal can finish a Hash House A Go Go portion. The Husband ate about a quarter (and that's being generous) of his chicken and waffles. I ate about an eighth of a meatloaf sandwich that would feed a small Bavarian village. I mean, I required a small crane to lift the thing. My jaw snapped trying to get an actual bite. 

The food is tasty comfort food, served large and proud. It's not haut cuisine, but they do enough inventive things with it to make it memorable for more than just size. I kept purloining The Husband's waffles and dipping them in whatever sauce they served it with. 

They will charge some kind of surcharge if you share a plate, but you probably shouldn't let that stop you if you think you can both settle on a dish to share. It might be best, because there is no other way you will have room for dessert there, and I did want to see if the dessert was as mammoth as everything else.",1,1,0

It said it had a fresh tomato pinwheel & bacon, and mine was only served with a green bean, olive, and lemon. And the mix wasn't good either, not very flavorful and  tasted watered down.

As I was browsing Yelp at 11 pm on a Friday evening with a serious case of drunchies, I found this gem. Looked through the photos, saw all the awesomeness, got even more hungry, came and definitely was not disappointed.

We didn't take much time to decide on the sage fried chicken benedict, as it was labeled as a favorite by the legendary Adam Richman from Man vs. Food. The food came out pretty quickly, even with three quarters of the tables seated. I would say our shared order of the benedict only took about ten minutes to arrive. 

Okay, so let me just say, this thing was a series piece of art. It was HUGE andddd looked absolutely delectable. That doesn't happen. I'm a petite, 5'1 woman, and the plate was, I kid you not, as large as my torso. Normally, I would feel slightly disgusted, maybe frightened, but looking at this, I felt nothing but hunger and some series salvation. 

When I finally put it in my mouth, oh my. It was definitely the most perfect creation, ever. So soulful, so satisfying. There was a nice crunch that came from the chicken and bacon, paired with a moist biscuit smothered in a chipotle hollandaise sauce with a slight kick. Yes, it was heaven and yes we finished it, all of it. 

On top of all this, our server was awesome. We only ordered the benedict to share, but she was still super nice and attentive to us. She came by often, made sure we enjoyed our meal and constantly topped off our waters. 

I would say, the only improvement that would bump the food from a 4 to 5 is if the biscuit was softer. The middle was great, but the outer edges were slightly dry and hard.

We live in San Diego and have been interested in trying the Hash House A Go Go. The singular SD location is always packed with a line out the door; its one of those ""phenomenon"" joints that was on the Food Channel and therefore will now be forever overcrowded.   So on a recent trip to Vegas we decided to take the opportunity to try one of the several HHAGG restaurants there and ended up at the one in the Imperial Palace hotel\/casino. 

Having spent much time in the Midwest over the past couple of years, I have become a big fan of Biscuits and Gravy. I saw this on the menu (""Indiana Style"") so I went for it, expecting the HHAGG version of this dish to be a mind-blower.  I noticed that it was served with mashed potatoes, which made me a bit curious.

When the Biscuits and Gravy came it was a disappointment. They put a HUGE pile of mashed potatoes all over the plate, then placed two biscuits on top of the potatoes, then put a SUPER THIN layer of sausage gravy over that. There was barely any sausage, and barely any gravy. The dish was essentially a giant platter of mashed potatoes. Neither the potatoes nor the biscuits were very tasty. I can't comment on the sausage gravy because there really wasn't enough to properly taste and evaluate. 

Service was also very slow considering that there were only a few people in the restaurant when we were there. 

I am glad however that we didn't go the route of waiting 45 minute to 1 hour for a table at the San Diego restaurant only to be let down by the mediocre food.  We won't be going back to the Hash House A Go Go and I won't be recommending it to my friends.",0,0,0

Upon arrival we gave our names for a table of 5, and only had to wait 5 minutes or so to be seated. The waiter took awhile to check in with us, and our drinks took at least 10 minutes. After ordering, we waited over 30 minutes for our food, and were getting really quite fed up by then. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we wanted more drinks, and didn't stop by to assure us about the wait until he knew our food was about to come out.

My advice for people eating here is to order something novel, not something simple, as the classics are the things they do least well. I'm an eggs benedict kinda girl but none of them caught my fancy (and most don't fit the description of eggs benedict, but regardless...). Two of us decided to split a buttermilk pancake, which was about the size of a pizza, and was fine. 

I went for the simple two-egg breakfast with soft poached eggs, ham, and potatoes. I asked for extra fruit instead of toast and was assured I'd get the fruit as listed, which turned out to be a slice of melon and a couple of sad pieces of fruit. I didn't even eat it. My plate was pretty empty-looking. The potatoes weren't fresh and the ham wasn't that hot. It was all just very dry and unappetizing. I tried to mix everything together into kind of a hash but ended up having to douse the whole thing in salt and hot sauce to get any flavor out of it.

Though I'd heard great things about this place, there's not much to love unless you're dazzled by big portions or crazy combinations with tons of ingredients. I tried the chicken and waffles, which was good but built in a big pile that had to be deconstructed just to eat it, which seemed like a lot of effort after a long wait. The service was slow and the food was subpar. Not impressed.",4,1,3

It was not that expensive for two lunches\/brunch and a drink, under $50.  The alcoholic drinks left a little to be desired.  I had a pink lemonade margarita.  It tasted sweet, sort of watered down.  Not that great & it took too long to get our drinks when the place wasn't full at the time me & my husband went. The food came almost at the same time as the drinks even thou we had ordered the drinks first. In my opinion they need to get more experienced, seasoned bartenders.  From what I saw they have young girls making drinks that don't look that serious about how to make a good drink.

The food, on a whole won't blow you're mind but it's darn good and there's lots of it.

I really love breakfast, but at the same time feel as though there are only so many ways you can cook an egg. Nevertheless, I felt breakfast here exceeded expectations by a mile. My wife had french toast with pecans on top and I almost never taste her food. It was so tasty. I had the Farm Scramble w\/ roasted chicken, fresh corn, roasted red pepper, & mozzarella (also tasty).

If you are expecting a quiet atmosphere, soothing music, and white table clothes during breakfast (or any other meal because they serve more than just breakfast), you've barked up the wrong tree. If large portions, fun wait staff and filling drinks are your thing, this will more than meet your expectations. It's more expensive than your local Denny's (which is up the strip), but it's Vegas... would you expect anything else?!

Me (as the waiter was setting down our drinks): Thank you. I think we're ready to order now.

We actually ate there twice because we were staying at the Imperial Palace.  The first night we had the Sage Chicken and Waffles and the #5 burger that was stuffed with bacon and avocado.  The chicken was dry and the hamburger really didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered a beer off of the draft list and was told that they don't carry draft beers at the that location but they all of the restaurants use the same menu.  That seems kinda cheap to me.  I was really looking forward to a Mothership.

The next night my husband and I shared the Sage chicken Benedict.  This time the chicken wasn't dry and the hollandaise sauce was flavorful but the biscuit underneath was dry and hard.  Our girls got the tractor pancake breakfast and the pancake was HUGE!! One lady that was walking by said ""Look its the Uncle Buck pancake!!!!""

Hash House a Go Go is located on the 2nd floor of the LINQ hotel\/Casino and it's known for large portions of food at a reasonable price.  

I made a reservation on Open Table because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. Linq hotel is on the strip and once you arrive, simply follow the sign for Hash House. Once you get off the escalator to the second floor the entrance is to the left. 

Upon arrival, I checked in to get my points for Open Table and to my surprise, it was only 1\/3 full on a friday; we arrived around 845p. We were seated and immediately someone came over to take our beverage order and ask if we had any questions about the menu. Well, heck yes! The menu contained several pages for breakfast, brunch, dinner and cocktails as well as a menu for specials. So, my first question was, what are the most popular items on the menu? After pointing out several popular items like the sage fried chicken and waffles, the big o chicken pot pie and the hash house cobb salad, etc. I was even more confused. So, what you're saying is ""everything"" is good? Lol.  Hmm...so many options and only one stomach! Lol. The menu can be intimidating so I would suggest you think about what you want to eat prior to arrival (the restaurant has a website and the menu is available for review). 

You will be given a large complimentary biscuit with honey while you plan your attack. Lol. But be careful with the biscuit, it's so filling that if you eat to much it will spoil your appetite. 

My friend ordered the Famous HH Smores Mocha and Grilled the Salmon plate. You will need a spoon to eat\/drink the Smores Mocha. It is served with a graham cracker and it has a thick layer of marshmallow on top with mocha underneath. My friend didnt finish it because it was too large but she loved it; she said it wasn't too sweet, it was just right. However, she didnt enjoy the salmon plate as much, but this was only because the carrots were served in large chunks and the mashed potatoes weren't mashed but a little undercooked. I ordered the brown sugar banana pancake and the warm spinach salad with grilled salmon.  Man, that pancake was more like a cake and the banana was so good, like they have carmelized it before adding it to the pancake batter. Much too large but absolutely fantastic! My grilled salmon was perfect! It was full of flavor and moist, not dry. The warm spinach salad was ok. The house made salad dressing is a type of vidalia vinegarette. Nothing special, but a solid dish.

Of course we didnt finish our meal (it was just too much food) but we enjoyed the experience. By the time we were ready to go, the restaurant was full with a 45 minute wait so I would suggest making a reservation to be safe. If you are in Vegas, dont miss this spot. You can thank me later!",1,2,2

Definitely reccomended the fried chicken eggs Benedict; you get a bed of mashed potatoes, two large biscuits, large cuts of crispy boneless fried chicken, topped with an egg and layered with their delicious Benedict sauce.

Other than that I also reccomended the corned beef hash or French toast.

Unfortunately, Hash House was a No Go for our party of 4.

There are a couple tricks to eating here: 
1. Go early.  Drag your still-drunk butt out of bed!  If you go before 9 there will not be much of a wait.  Go afterwards and you could wait longer than an hour.
2. Skip the mimosa.  Fresh squeezed juice is so much better without 2nd rate booze.
3. Stick with the basics.  Their Tractordriver special or the Chicken and Waffles are awesome.  Most of the rest seems overly heavy.
4. Get a to go bag.  Don't worry about fitting it in your minibar, just give it to one of the nice homeless vets hanging out on the strip.  You'll keep the food out of the landfill and feel better about helping someone in need.

And last but not least...

BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS. Period. This place is the ultimate experience of farm breakfast, taken to a whole new level. Their staple dishes are the Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles & Andy's Fried chicken Benedict. The portions are HUGE, no wonder they are featured on Man VS Food - it's a ridiculously amazing food experience. Share it with a friend! 

We went with Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles. 2 giant pieces of deep fried chicken were juicy and crispy. Tucked underneath was a tower of 4 thick waffles with bacon in the middle. Drizzle it up with maple syrup and hot sauce.... man it's heavenly!!! Highly recommended, well worth the 20 bucks for so much food(and yummy too)!!!! English breakfast tea was a great complement for the meal. It was served with an open tea bag and side pot of hot water. Coffee was great too. 

I'll definitely be back next time to try the fried chicken Benedict, and also their giant pizza sized pancakes!! 

Favorites:
* Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles ($19.99) - 2 sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks

Sad to report that I should have went with my gut instead of what was popular on the menu. The chicken lacked flavor, and my waffles were just okay. My meal was not good enough to eat even with a side of the delicious tangy soy BBQ sauce I asked for. My husband ordered the meatloaf sandwich which came with some really good tasting fried. His sandwich was also good which saved them from getting two stars. The customer service and decor were good handing them a star... They earned anywhere star because our food wasn't expensive at all. We live in SoCal, so we spend money on food and even our grocery stores are expensive; spending less than $40 for two people was a good surprise which made walking away without finishing my food feel less painful.

I'm actually giving 4 1\/2 stars!!!

Man! This place IS GOOD!! They do give out big portions, like big enough for two meals in one plate.

There were three of us who came on a Thursday afternoon right around lunch time. The lady told me the wait would be about 35 mins. We only waited for about 16 mins. That was nice. 

We sat in a booth that was for six people, it was huge lol. Our server, Travis, was one of the coolest people there. He had his hair mo-hawk style, but it was so long lol. I seriously think he uses half a bottle of gel for it each time. Anyway, he recommended the tangerine juice, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and one more item, but I forgot since we didn't order it. My friend and I ended up getting the tangerine juice, but it didn't taste fresh to us like it was supposed to be. It was still good though. It's close in taste with orange that's for sure. I ended up getting the House Smoked Salmon. It was delicious. However, I felt like there was too much bread and not enough salmon. Like they hid it under the sauce, so don't actually see how much salmon they give, but if you're like me and has to dissect everything, yeah...I shouldn't have this time. I only ate half of it there and took the rest to go. The fruits were good. My BF ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It was huge! He only ate half and took the rest to go.

Travis was a really good server. One of the best I've had. He was informative, good vibe, no attitude, made us feel welcomed.

But in terms of service, woah, not the greatest. I came around 7pm on Tuesday, and it wasn't busy.

I surveyed several of my friends that had visited the city several times. They were asked about all the best places to eat in Las Vegas. This place was highly recommended by all my friends. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT! First off, Las Vegas is crawling with tourist. So upon arrival, the place was swarming with people. Hash House A Go Go is located in The Quad hotel, but it has several other locations in Las Vegas.  We decided to do breakfast there. When we  arrived the hostess told us the wait was 45 minutes to an hour. Well, per usual, I was hungry and since we'd walked there from our hotel on the other side of the Las Vegas Strip, we were eating there. Just our luck, two seats opened up at the bar and we pounced on them. That made our wait about 2 minutes. 

Again, my friends raved about the breakfast at this place and no one spoke about the service. The service was great! The place gave me a southern feel. So it felt like home to me all they way over on the West Coast. Immediately, the server asked where I was from. You don't realize you have an accent until you travel. Lol! She was so helpful. She explained the meals like she was the chef\/cook that prepared them. After her spill, I decided on the Brown Sugar Banana FlapJack, which was enormous. It came with scrambled eggs and potatoes. It was awesome. I chose this because the man next to me was eating and enjoying it. I don't remember what my friend Andrea ordered, but she liked her selection also. 

The selection at this place is vast. Be prepared for a wait if you are with a group. The bar is ideal for two people. The serving size is really big. Once you are seated the service is fast.

Quality and quantity are the key words here. The portion sizes are fit for kings and queens. HUGE! My husband and I have yet to finish a full meal here. The waffles, chicken, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, french toast and many other dishes are so large that they could use their own individual plates! The meals are also vertical, literally. The food is piled on top of itself as you can see in many of the photos. The presentation and plating is stellar. As soon as you see your food, you're amazed! 

The quality of the food and seasonings are top notch. One of their little catch phrases is ""twisted farm food"", which definitely holds true. They even tell you when you order that everything is made to order, that they don't use any heat lamps, and that your food may come out in separate pieces and separate times. This is so awesome to me and ensures that my food is fresh. Even the juice is fresh squeezed when you order it, so it may take a few mins to arrive. 

The setup of the restaurant is really cool, roomy, kind of dark, and overall has a great vibe. We haven't had one bad customer service problem here. The wait staff is fantastic, and they all look genuinely happy to be working there. The main thing I noticed is that there are a million and one employees here. You see them zipping back and forth the whole time you're there. The staff is also VERY diverse as far as appearance and ethnicity. 

Be prepared for somewhat of a wait at this location. Eating at a restaurant such as Hash House A Go Go is definitely a priority for MANY people when they come to Vegas--myself included!",3,2,3

Every platter (even a simple Caesar salad) came out big enough for 2+ people and arranged in some unique design.  (With my friend's chicken and waffles, it was like a tower.)  I had the biscuits and gravy.  I didn't want mashed potatoes and had hoped to give that part to my husband, because they said they couldn't substitute for anything else.

Also it took a while to get the food after ordering so either plan ahead or snack a little bit before you head here- you may wait a while before you eat.

Ok so the real review. This place has a funky name but let me say they do not mess around with food. It's a fun building with a wall of fame of people who ate here. Big waiting area with lots of seating which was nice. The staff are constantly busy but the hostess did a great job staying organized and they call your name over a speaker so you can hear when your table is ready. 

We sat down in a nice booth with plenty of room and were quickly greeted by our server. She seemed a little rushed but hey it's insanely busy so I understand. Drinks came quick but food took maybe 15 min, but felt like a lifetime. As I mentioned, we were very hungry so we ordered too much food!! The portions are no joke. One meal can easily be two meals. I got the chicken hash and my partner got the healthy boring thing, and we decided to split one blackberry pancake which turned out to be enough food for a family of 5. This pancake was unreal. My hash was good but I wasn't blown away. The pancake was surprisingly fluffy and tasty despite being ridiculously enormous. We were happy we came here and they have some really fun, over the top brunch items for a decent price but some of it may leave you feeling paralyzed. It's more about eating a giant meal and bang for buck than top quality ""5 star"" type breakfast. Definitely recommend checking it out.",1,0,0

When the hash came out, it looked absolutely gorgeous...then it went quickly downhill from there.

tough choice, food was a little bit better than average, the overall service was way less than standard and the atmosphere was not good.
1st.  as would be expected on a Sunday morning, 50 minute wait. Not bad for Vegas.  however, the 40 additional minutes to bring the food is outrageous.  they tell you it is going to take that long because they cook it fresh and  they do not use heat lamps.  I worked in restaurants, heat lamps have nothing to do with timing neither does cooking it fresh.  that part was unacceptable.  the music was way too loud.  basically you have to commit to three hours for this place while the music blares.
  
2nd.  but for two items, the food was good.  Banana pancakes, eggs, potato were tasty.  the sausage was below average.  The bacon was horrible and that was even after we told them how we liked it.  three attempts of failure.  no way that was freshly cooked.  Oh, and the ice tea was bad.

The Warm Spinach would have been better if they didn't drench the salad in vinaigrette.  A completely weak $9 salad.  Small with no substance, much like the garbage of a hotel casino this place is located in.  Does anyone else besides me think it's time for place to go?  Imperial Palace?  Come on now, is this place even politically correct?

The Benedict tasted absolutely disgusting.  I enjoy artery clogging goodness as much anyone else but this was just so poorly executed.  So the place had a few biscuits, scrambled eggs, and two fried chicken breast fillet haphazardly lumped together on a plate, drench and I mean completely a quart of sauce drench in some sauce I cannot make out.  Nothing is spared, everything just tasted like this disgusting thousand islands mayo based concoction.  Even if the Fried Chicken was good, there would have no way for me to have known.

I just couldn't tell if he was serious, but knowing him as long as I do, I should have know he was.

I felt so bad for suggesting this place to my good buddy that I gave him my credit card for the night.

Once you actually get there, the atmosphere and decor is great, and divorces itself from the rest of the property as soon as you get off the escalator. But you're there for the food. And if you're not starving, don't even bother. The portions are simply massive. Everything is so fresh, not to mention highly addictive. I've tried probably half the menu, and never gotten anything that wasn't wonderful. 

Chicken and waffles. Do it! It's cliche I know, but it is just delicious. I've also tried various things with pancakes and eggs that were between amazing and sublime. And of course it's Vegas, so they serve whatever kind of booze you'd like. Only had a regular sit-down dinner with friends here once, and we were pretty beaten up already, so not sure about the drinks. But you haven't lived until you've recovered from a hangover with pancakes and beer. For me this place was better than Excedrin and bottled water combined.

I actually got hooked on Hash House via their Hillcrest location in San Diego (where I learned the joy of full bar booze and breakfast). The line there on a Sunday could be an hour long, but it was so worth the wait. And I can't wait to get back to Vegas to try their new spot at the M.

The only thing about Hash House that I'm on the fence about is whether I want them to go national. I'd love to have one here in Florida, but I think it might lose some of its charm. And as places get bigger, sometimes they lose some of their quality. But I might be willing to roll the dice on a Florida franchise. I can guarantee them at least one customer on opening day.",3,0,1

Death won't even cure this hangover, so you go for the next best thing - an eating binge.
Yes, only food and aspirins can help you now. But where to go? So many choices in Vegas. Here's what I do.
Head to The Quad, wind your way down a seemingly endless maze of hallways, up a couple flights of stairs and voila, Hash House a Go Go.

Ask the server for the most popular menu item. She'll be quick to tell you it's the Sage Fried Chicken; a mountainous glob of mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and of course, fried chicken - all suffocating under a lava flow of spicy, melted cheese.

There are definitely some folks that should not be eating at a place like this, but who am I to judge.

The imitation chicken and waffles are laughably bad, though grandiose to be sure--oversized portions served on a giant platter.  Eggos are far better than the waffles I sampled, and the dessicated chicken proved barely edible.  The enormous pancakes fared just as poorly in my opinion.

My friend and I ordered the bacon waffle with eggs and the salmon sandwhich.  The portions were really big so we couldn't eat everything and only ate half of our foods.

I immediately called for the waiter to come over. This was unacceptable. I asked the waiter to bring over the manager and all she said was that we have exterminators that spray and that the only thing I can do is take half off your bill. She acted as if it was no big deal.

Why should I have to pay when I got a roach in my container. So disgusted and nasty. I will no longer be eating here.",4,1,1

I slowly  pulled everything apart so my plate can be organized  without embarrassing myself when I got ready to eat it. I wanted to dive in immediately. My chicken was crunchy on the outside, nice and moist on the inside with unique flavors coming from everywhere. My Bacon stuffed Waffle (my two for one) was perfection,there was a  nice crust on the Waffle and the Bacon had a nice crunch to it also this was a perfect bite and the combination was genius. The maple syrup added was warm and smooth and the service was attentive and memorable. Hash House A Go Go is a great place for breakfast. Check it out!

The serving size for both these plates is huge so they are perfect for sharing and there is going to be leftovers. 

The sage fried chicken Benedict was amazing I'm not sure why some of the reviews that I've read said is was bland. To me the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the mashed potatoes where a nice touch and had a little bit of spicy flavored added to the dish. It also had had eggs and bacon in the dish. It was really awesome and it would be hard for me not to order anything but this I really thought this was a great meal.

The sage chicken and waffles was also a huge portion chicken was also seasoned wonderfully and the waffles had bacon in them. Maybe could of used more syrup but overall it was great I liked my Benedict over the chicken and waffles. They also had strong coffee which is a plus in my book.

The only thing I can say negative about this place is the service that we got from our waiter was really bad. It took forever to get refills on coffee and water. Also wanted cream and sugar for the coffee no problem see you in 15min and we had a set of dirty silverware when we sat down.",1,0,0

The Caesar was good...hard to mess up though.  They did have parmesan crisps that I liked and instead of croutons, they fried up squares of polenta - the bf was not a fan of that.

The pasta dish wasn't that great...the sauce was entirely too sweet.  The fried chicken was very good though and the two of us were able to finish this easily.

Unfortunately, we had to wait a really long time to get it. 

It's awesome when a place is popular, and I don't mind waiting if the expectations are set right. But the staff at Hash House A Go Go was severely underestimating wait times and discouraging people from leaving the lobby of the restaurant. This was undoubtedly costing revenue from the casino, where people might have entertained themselves while waiting. Perhaps a cell phone alert system would help Hash House A Go Go manage the wait?

Once we were seated, our excellent waiter promptly warned us that the kitchen was operating on a 45 minute delay. This was annoying, but since the waiter set those expectations, we were able to cope.

The food arrived and my God, these portion sizes were out of control. I could easily have shared my meal with 1.5, maybe 2 other people. There was so much food that I couldn't stop feeling guilty about the inevitable waste, because even if scrambled eggs reheated well, I had no place to refrigerate them in my hotel room. The pancakes were the size of vinyl records, and my biscuit was bigger than a regulation-sized softball. It was insane.

All that said, the food was delicious. Really good! My chicken hash was well-seasoned and the hash browns were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the huge side of fruit was fresh. My husband's bowl of oatmeal, aside from being giant, also came laden with tons of fresh fruit. We all liked our food.

If Hash House A Go Go got their queue style in order and reduced their portion sizes to something resembling a responsible serving, they'd easily earn 4 stars from me. As for now, this is place I'd enjoy going again but wouldn't bother waiting in that line for.",0,1,1

Having been to the San Diego location (of which I still have fond memories), I knew Hash House was the way to go.

It was a bit of a challenge finding the restaurant (go to the center of the Imperial Palace casino and take the escalator up), but the hostess was friendly and courteous and we were seated after just five to ten minutes of waiting.

We ordered the sage fried chicken benedict, meatloaf hash, and griddled french toast.  The meatloaf hash consisted of blocks of underseasoned meat nestled amongst huge blocks of potatoes, which gave an overall effect of dry mushiness.  The fried chicken benedict was pretty good, but I didn't eat much of it because the french toast was right in front of me and I LOVE FRENCH TOAST.  This one was no disappointment; the big, fluffy toast tasted great with the banana cinnamon cream, blackened banana and toasted pecans.  I forced myself to finish the whole thing because it was just that good.

Overall my family was happy with the amount and quality of the food.  A warning though: Hash House serves up diet-busting, waistline-expanding, food coma-inducing goodness.

1)  There is always and hour or more wait, and there are no light up thingies to let you know - so you either go and make the res, then gamble and come back - or you sit outside on your phone in the wait area.
2)  The food is touted on Man v. Food (the special I chose), New York Times, and ABC's Nightline - but I think everyone brings their A-game for those folks...know whatta I mean?
3)  It's pretty small - hence the wait.

I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict style:  layered:  red skin mashed potatoes, a large split homemade biscuit, soft style scrambled eggs, bacon, a chicken fried chicken breast (Andy Sage style), fresh spinach, tomatoes, and topped with mozzarella (mine was burnt), and chipotle sauce.  What I learned is that you must cut through all the layers and attempt to form ""the perfect bite.""  The first few of these were 1) unsuccessful 2) extremely delicious.  At this point, it began to turn into a huge pile of chipotle sogged biscuit, through which you dig to find nuggets of chicken fried chicken, spinach, or bacon.  (My suggestion is to make a dish with those three and keep the chipotle on the side).  Within minutes of eating a little less than half, I was very ill.  Now, this could ONLY be the food, and not the 17 or so vodka tonics from the night before...or the bloody mary I had while waiting.  Be warned. 

My companions had various versions of: flank steak, chunk hash browns, various veggies, and biscuit - and it all looked really messy and unappealing.  One friend had the BBLT (just add bacon to bacon), which comes on HUGE Texas toast, and she added a medium fried egg on the side.  That looked really good.  The service was outstanding and the time at the table, and getting out was pleasant, unrushed, and memorable (there were 7 of us).

FOOD ORDERED:
-HH signature Mimosa - just right for Vegas!

-2 Tractor Driver Combo's (includes 2 farm eggs, bacon, sausage, or potatoes with 1 hash house signature flapjack).

I got the Brown Sugar Banana Flap Jacks with my combo - fluffy & wholesome, and was the size of an XL plate.

Hubby got the Snickers Flap Jack - ehhh, needed more snickers...

Kids Bacon Waffle (had large strips of bacon baked into a LARGE waffle) - sweet and salty, what a perfect balance...

ATMOSPHERE: 
In the Imperial Palace, 2nd floor. It has its own escalators. Got a little lost. Needs more signs in Casino. Clean, Metal, garage like, Reminds me of an upscale burger joint. 

SERVICE:
25 minute wait. Went there at 1100 am. Good at first, then slow at the end to bring the check. But, overall good.

Comes with a steak knife and sprig of rosemary sticking out of it.  It's not just an eggs benedict with some fried chicken in it.

It was a little hard to find but only because of construction going on. The place is upstairs and has a really neat and interesting interior. We were seqted (both times we went) within 15 minutes! 

Both times I ordered the tractor driver breakfast which I got with eggs, a waffle, potatoes, and I got an extra side of sausage. This meal was huge and so filling!

I honestly did not see any reviews before we went, I just loved the name.   Holy cow, you better be ready for some serious breakfast when you get there.

The pancakes are larger than the plate they are served on.  My guess is they are equivalent to 6 normal pancakes with the thickness of them.  They are AMAZINGLY good which is somewhat surprising given the size of them.  I just sampled a friend's pancake but did not order one.

I went with the smoked bacon, avocado, onion scrambler with the crispy potatoes and biscuit.  I was a bit surprised because it was served in a plate, I was expecting a cast iron skillet like my friend received with his scrambler.  But no matter, it was just so incredibly good.  Potatoes were perfect and the sprig of rosemary in the biscuit added  a nice touch of flavor.   Coffee was excellent as well.

Adam Richman himself marks their famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict as a Man Vs. Food favorite!!!! There's even a picture of him holding the plate!  Look for it in their picture gallery 

spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade - This was absolutely delicious! Whoever would have thought that watermelon would go well with alcohol or even do a good job masking the taste! I got a pretty good buzz going on and didn't taste anything! Absolutely refreshing in this summer heat!

hashed house quesadilla stuffed with mashed potatoes, jalapenos, eggs, and tomato with chili cream - Deliciously creamy and soft to eat due to their red skin mashed potatoes! The tortilla was perfectly crispy!! It was so big!!! I loved the sprinkled peppers on top! Gave it a mexi-kick! And those skinny, brown sticks in front?

We will never not share here and so therefore the prices are great!!! Expect to wait here to be seated but it honestly goes fast! Only reason I do not have this a five yet is the fact our service was a bit off. Slow to get to us, slow getting refills, etc. Nice as hell guy, but needs pick it up a bit. Can not wait to come here again!! PS: That hash!! ummmmmuummmmmumm.",1,0,1

Black employees would seat black guests, while white and Asians and Hispanics could wait for a seat at the back of the bus.

Black customers offered booths,, other non-black customers refused booths and were only allowed tables in the middle of the dining room.

Complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears. He grabbed his car keys and left the scene.

Since the first time i tried this place, Ive ate here about 3-4 times already.  I guess you can consider this as an accumulation review of all the times i have been here. 

Location:  There are actually two Hash House A Go Go in Vegas...one off the strip and on on the strip (this one).  The one on the strip is a hidden gem located on the second floor of Imperial Palace now known as The Quad.  Prepare to wait anywhere from 15 mins to over an hour.   Luckily they give you a pager so you can still wander inside the casino.

Food: The food here in my opinion is actually pretty good.  The price is relatively cheap (most stuff are around $15 - $20) considering all the other places on the strip and the portion size are HUGE.  You can easily share one dish.  Hash House is known for their 

Sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower (bacon built inside the waffle).  Everytime someone orders this the room tends to get quite and people stare going wtf. 

Hash House Farm Benedict  (Seen on Man v. Food);

BBLT (Imagine if you let someone who hates lettuce and tomato but loves bacon to build his own BLT with the only catch being there has to be at least one piece of lettuce and tomato...lol).

The only thing i didnt like too much was their 1lb Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar stuffed burger.  The burger was very bland and lacked flavor.

Overall this is a good place to go to if you don't want to spend too much money and wanna feel food preggo (if you dont share).",0,0,0

The menu has a wide selection of what they call fractured farm.  The portions are large and really 2 people can eat one meal.  The watermelon was extremely tasty! The biscuits and preserves are fresh made and are to die for.  I had a scramble which was very delicious but could have been a little warmer but could have gotten cold from the Arctic blast on he walk from the kitchen to the table.

The wait was rather long for early Monday afternoon, over 30 minutes, but it comes with the territory of eating on the strip. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the stifling heat in the restaurant. It was uncomfortably hot even during a cold day in February.

Our server was friendly, but he could have been more attentive to filling our coffee mugs. I guess we didn't look haggard or hung over enough.

My husband pointed to the vegetarian hash, and said, ""That sounds like you! Sun dried tomatoes and artichokes!"" So that's what I ordered, and I was so disappointed when the hash arrived with yucky raw tomatoes. The hash was underwhelming overall. The flavorful potatoes saved the dish. The biscuit on the side was ok.

My husband went for the biscuits and gravy as he always does. I know people talk a lot about the portion size at this place, but that dish is actually normal size. He liked it, but it wasn't as good as the restaurants back home.

I do however fancy the stand alone location. For one reason, SOFT scrambled eggs. It is so rare to find scrambled eggs that are creamy rather than incredibly firm.

First off... its in one of the cheapest hotels on the strip. I was surprised that they actually chose the imperial palace as their location. I think it would fit better in the planet hollywood or hard rock hotel but thats just my opinion. 

This place was very crowded but that does not excuse the poor service. Other locations are equally as busy but still manage to provide decent food drinks and service. 

The drinks here were so so and the food was alright. The service was piss poor. Half our food barely made it out and when it did it was incomplete. 

To speak on behalf of the Hash House brand... Hash House has a crazy odd menu with large pizza pan size pancakes, bag of bud light and bacon, giant biscuits with gravy, and excellent bloody marys. Its definitely worth a try.

The pancake was pretty light and fluffy despite its massive size. It literally filled up the entire large plate and was about 1.5 inches thick. The waffles were dense and cooked perfectly. The Eggs Benedict came with a very LARGE split biscuit + a MOUND of perfectly seasoned mashed potatoes. The chicken for all the dishes was very good with the sage seasoning and had an amazing crust.

My friend from Florida had never heard of this place (He doesn't get to Orlando much to hit the one on I-Drive) and was really hungry, so I knew we could not go wrong here.

The mistake my good friend made was ordering the Chicken and Waffles plate and not offering to split it with me, as he boldly bragged about being hungry enough to consume anything put in front of him.

Despite warnings from myself, the server and anyone else who knows better, he forced me to order my own plate which I happily did as a veteran of their awesome meatloaf sandwich and mashed potatoes.

Shortly before my friend's plate arrived, he saw another Chicken and Waffles entree walk by on its way to a table in the next room and he looked at me and said, ""Ok. I'm in trouble.""

He gave it a heck of an effort, but the battle was clearly over before it was ever fought. However, he enjoyed the signature item as much as I always have on my visits and I'll never let him hear the end of this. (Although he still smiles when he thinks of how bacon is INSIDE the waffles)

In the true spirit of Hash House, we washed down as much of our entrees as we could handle with a brown bagged 25 ounce can of the King of Beers and even walked out with those in hand after we paid our server, who did a really good job throughout our visit despite being really busy.

So, if you're a first-timer, please listen to your friends who take you here. Find something scrumptious on the menu that you can share and take that route. You'll have plenty to eat and STILL probably be asked if you want a box to take the rest home or back to your hotel room.",2,0,1

Couple things to know:

-You may not get your food at the same time at the table (they do not have heat lamps).  Our server told us this up front, we couldn't care less.

-The portions were ridiculously huge.  I can take down a TON of food, and i could not finish my waffles (probably could have had I not ate a bunch of my wife's food).

-The drinks, (in comparison to other specialty drinks in LV) were fairly priced - $8 for 20oz.  I had the Champagne Supernova with my breakfast and thought it was wonderful.

We have been to probably 30+ restaurants on the strip ranging from uber expensive to very cheap.  Overall this is the most pleased I have been at any restaurant in LV, and I cannot wait to go back.

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it.

During my Vegas research, Hash House seemed the perfect spot for just that.

Organizing a party of 10 for breakfast in Vegas can be quite challenge, but luckily, everyone was late at about the same time. We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there. Once seated, the drink menu led me to my first show; a BLT Bloody Mary;

Crisp toast, bacon, lettuce, and a tomato wedge all garnished this liquid meal. My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. 

I pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy. After an expectedly long wait, our food began to pile in. 
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=bPvsgg04sxgX91PJmswpQQ

The biscuits were surprisingly light and fluffy and the gravy had about a pound of diced sausages in it. It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. 

I also tried a bite of the ""stuffed"" burger and was very let down. We were expecting the ingredients to be cooked in the meat, not just placed between two over-cooked patties.

Came here for dinner on our night of arrival to Vegas. I always wanted to try it but always backed out after seeing how huge the portions were. But this time we were staying at the Linq hotel and Hash house a go go was there so thought we would give it a try. I hear it gets pretty packed, especially during brunch hours, not sure if they take reservations but just keep in mind there can be a wait. We came for an early dinner so luckily there was no wait. 

The menu has lots to choose from so good if you come with a big group. They have everything from burgers, entrees, salads, pastas and a few late night breakfast items. They bring you a complimentary basket of huge biscuits with honey drizzled on top. We all split it in half as they were as big as my face. The biscuits were warm and soft in the inside but a nice crust on the outside and the honey, sweet lord it was the perfect way to begin our dinner.

_Hash House Cobb Salad. Mixed greens, smoked chicken, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion, avocado, blue cheese, smoked bacon all tossed blue cheese dressing and trimmed with barbecue sauce. I had a feeling this salad was going to be packed with dressing. And sure enough it was not only drenched in dressing but with blue cheese as well. You think your are getting a salad because you want something a little light and something with greens but you end up getting one of the heaviest and richest because of all the dressing and blue cheese which is already full of flavor as a small dose. The greens were wilted and not as crunchy because of the dressing. My gf did not eat much of it. 
_Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. Drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks. The name says it all, as it really came out in a high tower! 3 amazing waffles that were nicely toasted and soft inside, and even better that there were bits of bacon inside. A nice combo of sweet and salty when drizzled with the maple syrup. The fried chicken was okay. I think too much of a thick better and not enough chicken itself. Still great when eaten all together with the chicken, waffle and syrup. The combo is just a sensational flavor that makes you dance inside. 
_The Basic. Two egg breakfast any style, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham). I got this as I did not want too much of a heavy meal before we start the night out. Very standard, nothing amazing. I got egg whites, and although it says 2 eggs I felt it was 3-4.. Not complaining but I've made egg whites many times and it's never that big hahaha. The sausage were good, a bit salty and a tad  sweet, nice to bair with my bland and healthy egg whites. I did not eat the biscuit but the cut potatoes were great and nicely crispy. The fruit was just a slice of cantaloupe. You think you are eating healthy but the portions are so huge we basically did family style so I ate a little of everyone's dish. 
_Pork Ribs. Pork ribs on smashed potato, steamed carrots, green beans  with a demi glaze sauce. I kind of made this title up as I did not see it on the menu so I just described what was on the dish haha. My gf thought the pork rib would be like Park's bbq ribs or Southern or Texas style bbq ribs but it was almost like a cutlet of ribs where there is bones but you can almost cut the knife into it. It was good but nothing amazing, the sauce could have been worked on as it was a bit salty and something in it was missing, it was not that memorable. The smashed potatoes were great with the pork. My fave was the green beans\/haricot verts. Very thin and slightly crunchy and the sweet sauce just soaked in. I was not a huge fan of the cooked carrots, very bland and just seemed tossed in to add some veggies and colors. A pretty solid dish overall.

What can I say about Hash House that i'm sure hasn't already been mentioned a mouthful of times. See what I did there? And seeing is believing when you see the portions here. Holy macaroni!

Ginormous portions. Crazy delicious food. Delicious boozy drinks. Fun atmosphere. 

While the portions were clearly more than either of us could eat, and we could have shared a single item... then why are you in vegas if not to indulge and go overboard? I felt zero guilt only eating a third of my plate and giving the rest of it to a hungry homeless person on the strip. Why not? 

If you come here on the weekends, especially during peak meal hours... expect to wait! While the wait may seem daunting, it went faster than expected. Talk to people in line with you, meet new people. It's fun. We met a couple from the UK there on vacation. Super awesome accents.... but I digress from the topic at hand. Hash House! 

Huge fan of this place. My waistline and taste buds thank you hash house. Well done.

1) Adam Richman did the fried chicken eggs benedict challenge here (http:\/\/www.travelchannel.com\/video\/fried-chicken-eggs-benedict-12437) 
2) Highly rated on Yelp 
3) Recommended by a BM. All those factored combined, we HAD to trek our way over and taste it ourselves. 

The portions here are HUGE. You have been warned. We had 7 people and we shared two entrees and one side: 

Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle - One of THE best chicken and waffles I ever had. The chicken was moist, tender, packed full of juice and flavor while the waffle was drizzled with maple syrup and bacon BAKED inside! It was a good balance between sweet and savory. LOVE THIS DISH! As Jimmy McMillian says 'The Rent is Too Damn High', this dish is 'Too Damn Good""!! :) You will not go wrong with this staple meal. Just thinking about it makes my tummy grumble :(

Original Eggs Benedict - served with some fruits on the side. Tasty but not memorable. I would have gotten the Adam Richman's challenge! *drool*

Corn Beef Hash - with potatoes, scrabble eggs and swiss cheese. The potatoes were my fav in this dish, nom nom nom.

Be prepared for the LOoOoooOong WAIT here.  Good part is you can put your name down on a list and go gamble.  For 2 people the wait was an hour and 15 minutes.  Another way to beat the system is to order your meal to-go it took 30 minutes.

Trust me when I say you can share a dish.  For the girls trying to hit up the clubs later on at night I suggest you DON'T try to finish a dish and just share.  Unless you don't mind feeling like a torta exploding out of your mini dress LOL.

The food here is ehhh...

Chicken and Waffles:  chicken was dry and the skin wasn't as crispy as I like.  The waffles were huge but sort of soft and mushy.  Every bite required a big gulp of milk to wash it down - that dry.

OG Benedict:  bacon, spinach, eggs over easy and biscuit with a tomato cream dressing which was delicious!  Comes with mashed potatoes which makes everything better (and unhealthier but who cares you're in Vegas!).

My family and I were here for Christmas weekend, and we actually had this for Christmas breakfast. The restaurant is located inside of the LINQ. When you enter, look for signs for restaurants or Hash House A Go Go, it's located on the second floor - there are escalators and stairs that bring you upstairs.

We dropped in around 11:30 AM and the wait was 45 mins - 1 hour. We seated in 45 minutes. The wait times they give you are pretty accurate. 

For 5 people, we ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Chorizo Hash, a Red Velvet Pancake, and a S'mores Mocha. The portions are HUGE, we barely finished the 3 savory dishes, and couldn't finish the pancake.

S'mores Mocha - The toasted marshmallow on top is amazing!!! I basically just ate all of that and didn't want the mocha anymore, but still drank it. If you're like me and eat all the marshmallow first, the mocha itself will taste pretty bland.

Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - Delicious! The chicken was fried perfectly, super crisp on the outside and still juicy on the inside. I was very impressed. The waffles were good and had pieces of bacon pressed into them! 

Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - Also delicious!! Once again, chicken was PERFECT. Really liked the chipotle sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were thick and flavorful, really no complaints. The biscuit was soft, a little much for me, will probably ask for it on the side next time.

Chorizo Hash - Not as good as the other two chicken dishes, but still good and flavorful. Didn't have much of this because didn't want to waste stomach room on it!

Red Velvet Pancake - Probably the worst dish of the 4. The pancake was super crumbly and and dry. It did have a red velvet flavor, but it just wasn't enjoyable since it was so dry.

Overall, great place to grab food! Prices were understandable (around $20 a dish) considering the portions and how everything in Vegas is more expensive. Would recommend the both chicken dishes for sure. If you asked me to choose between the two, I would probably choose the benedict. The mashed potatoes were just better than the waffles, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either!",1,2,2

I was actually surprised that I did not see more people ordered the fried chicken waffle, but when ours arrived, people were asking to take pictures of our food. It was HUGE.

First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable ""hash"" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're ""famous"" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I'm allergic to dairy so there really wasn't any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband's would have gotten cold.

This is my first review and the first time I have ever been so let down by all the good reviews!

Saw it on tv and it looked great!
Real life, unfortunately, was a let down.

Here are my gripes:
1) had breakfast after 11am. They only serve scrambled eggs after 11.
     for the price they ask, this seems to be a bit lame!

2) pancake was not good!  very tough and very short on flavor!
tough?  i could shingle my roof with them!

3) my 3 eggs and bacon breakfast was $9.00. Not to far out of range   until  you count the bacon!  2 strips of bacon!!
This was not thick bacon, nor was it special bacon!
two strips of thin regular bacon!!

How can they boast about their 1ib burgers and giant pancakes and oversized and overstuffed everything,  and then serve 2 slices of thin regular bacon!

4) dried out biscuit!!  they did not even serve butter and jam with the biscuit!
Do they feel that it was so good that it needed no help?

They serve mojitos and margaritas while you wait because you will wait. 
Many times the wait can be an hour. So grab a buzzer and go gamble for a few minutes. Our friend is a diamond member and we got in real quick.

It is just as good as the one in Vegas. Much smaller.  But they really know how to do flavors. They can make something as simple as bacon, eggs, and chicken taste like the best thing I ever ate. The last time I went to Vegas it was a 4 night trip. We ate at hash house a go go 3 times. Best trip ever.  I am not a burger and fries person. But they really know how to do it. The beef is flavorful and the fries are very crispy. It is enough for at least 2 meals and is even good reheated. I also love andys sage fried chicken Benedict. I've eaten it many times.

Got there and told it'd be about 30 minutes to get a table and we wanted to go back downstairs to gamble, so we asked for a pager.  She said to not go too far or it wouldn't work.  After 30 minutes we came back up to check and they'd called us 5 minutes earlier (pager didn't work cuz I guess we went too far). But they quickly seated us anyway, so that was great.

Service was good.  Only thing that would have been better is if they'd checked on us a bit more and refilled drinks more often.  But that's often the case with the average restaurant that's so busy you're waiting to get a table.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.

I ordered the sage chicken benedict and my husband had the banana pecan french toast.  We're pretty big eaters and he did manage to clean his plate, but I could only do about half of mine, even though it was delicious.  If you're with someone you can share a meal with and can come to an agreement on what to order (so much to choose from) then I suggest sharing.

It had a large piece of delicious fried chicken on top of eggs, biscuits and mashed potatoes. It was all topped off with a gravy that had some zip to it. The biscuits were obviously home-made and absolutely light and fluffy. The gravy was a perfect compliment instead of traditional hollandaise.

My companion had the egg skillet with Chorizo sausage and got a tortilla in lieu of a biscuit. Right choice. It was a great meal - wrapping up eggs, chorizo and potatoes in a home-made tortilla. Again, very delicious.

My companion also had a BLT bloody mary....which is a bloody mary with bacon, tomato, lettuce and a slice of toast coming out of it. It was tasty, but probably not worth the price. May just want to stick with a traditional bloody mary.

Wait was 25 minutes when we arrived around 11am on a Friday. We sat at the bar so we didn't have a wait, but it appeared they turned tables pretty quickly. Staff was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations and suggestions.

Our server was great but the runners bringing food gave one of our plates to another table and then when we told him, he said ""no you are wrong"" and walked around. Very rude and short, which we nicely explained to our waiter when he came to check in a few minutes later.
