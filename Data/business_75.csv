I'm still not a fan that most of the time it's hard to find a seat and have it be quiet enough to focus on anything. Additionally, I am sad that my favorite shoe chair that was an important part of an evening I had with Tony A. seems to no longer be there.

This happens to me anytime I adventure away from my usual order at lux.  This has happened to me here the first time I've ordered the americano, the yogurt parfait, and the scones. The bakers here are legit le cordon bleu graduates from what I hear (and taste).  

The brown sugar macadamia scone is this glistening golden glimmer of a pastry with a crumbly biscuit texture on the outside and gooey butter cream in the center.  When I first laid eyes on the one selected for me I actually thought ""she gave me the good one!"" It had me asking deep questions about the universe.  

At times, the line is long but no worries the staff actually is efficient and gets through it in minutes.  The only downside is the coffee condiment area is booty to booty with the people ordering & paying.  No worries as everyone moves through pretty quickly. 

The decor and art at lux is perfection: hip coffee atmosphere achieved.  Literally, the best people watching with 2 outdoor areas.

Usually I'll eat inside and then enjoy my pastry outside because I like to bring my Jack Russell terrier and tie her on the bench in front of pane bianco.  

My final tip- if it sounds or looks good definitely order it.",5,3,2

It was very hip, actually too hip for me, as I found the servers and the atmosphere very cold and unwelcoming...maybe even mean. Well, a lot of time passed, Lux changed buildings I think, and I was hearing great things about it from Claire F, who still lives in Phoenix. So ~12 years later, I gave it another try, and this time, it totally wowed me. 

It's still hip. Like super hip. But this time, everyone is friendly enough to make you feel really welcome. The furniture and decor are really eclectic and thrift-store cool. The crowd is pretty varied - on a Saturday night there were a few people too young to sit at the bar, mostly 25-35s, and a few 50+ sitting eating or reading or working on their laptops.

My favorite part of Lux is that it has a little section devoted to everything: a to-go counter for the bakery items; a more 'restaurant-y' area with bigger tables for ordering off the full dinner menu which varies nightly; a bar area where you can sit at the bar and converse with the bartenders or at smaller cocktail tables; a back room where you can watch a movie or chat; and a quiet room which has no music so you can utilize the free wifi.

We didn't eat dinner, but the menu looked interesting - the special that night was some kind of steak with veggies. We did have desserts (awesome, especially the salted chocolate chip cookie) and drinks (excellent beer list, and 'collaborative' cocktails. Seriously, you just talk to the bartender about what you like).

To top it all off, the walls are filled with the work of local artists, they have a big patio on Central (near the light rail!) and it's located next to Pane Bianco.

If you think you're not cool enough to hang out here, you're not. But they won't hold it against you.",3,1,0

The cappuccino is wonderful; one of my favorites! I can't say that enough! I recommend making a trip to try one if you haven't! The food is always tasty and unique. If you can find a good place to sit I would try ordering one of the items on their menu, really fantastic! All of the pastries I have tried have been delicious also! I am telling you, you need to go!

The only reason Lux gets a 4 instead of 5 is because of the atmosphere. When I go its hit or miss, most of the time I get the impression they are way too hipster - bordering pretentious - to care about your experience. The following are just a couple examples:

I wanted to try a drink at their full bar one night, so I asked one of the employee's behind the bar what he had in his hand and he responded with ""ice"". Yes, there was a piece of ice held in a pair of tongs in one hand, but he also had a cocktail in the other hand... Following his response, he walked away from me and never returned to ask if I had any interest in ordering a drink or to give me any clue about what he'd been making. Most restaurants and employee's attempt to make you feel involved and entice you to purchase something, but no such luck. Unfortunately that experience was followed by another unpleasant one at the bar on a different night, so I haven't felt inclined to drink there again. 

I had another recent experience with lux when I ordered a quiche from the front. We waited 10 minutes for them to heat it up but it was never called. So we checked and they said ""oh, it must still be in the oven"".. Although, didn't bother checking on the item or why this was taking so long to heat (since its already cooked). After another 10 minutes we checked with the front again and she finally went to check and said, ""Oh, I guess its been in the oven the whole time"". Needless to say it was overdone. The staff didn't apologize or offer a replacement, sadly this didn't impress my friend who hadn't been to Lux.

I still say you should go, the food and espresso are amazing. I just wish they would come back down to earth a little bit.",1,0,0

I told the bartender I didn't want soda and I didn't want alcohol. He made me this amazing concoction of lemonade, a fresh lemon, cherry flavoring, and fresh mint. It was delicious! I told him he should put it on the menu. You should go order one so he will actually do it.

Lux is the kind of place middle aged women go to pretend they are hip, the place where you won't find any seating unless you come at an odd hour, and most of all the place where I find myself pretending to study but end up just being amazed at people who are actually studying.

Best coffee in town, considering the size of the kitchen and that they do all their baking and cooking in here, the size of the menu and the outcomes of every dish that I've had in the last 4 years are astonishing, from pastries to quiche, mac and cheese to steak dinners this place can make whatever you're craving with honors. Also probably the most hipster bar I've ever seen, but boy do they do it right. Wonderful cocktails and decent beer and wine selection. 

To some it's a magical place, to others it's a over-hyped coffee shop. Either ways this place has established itself and definitely deserves a try.",1,1,1

coffee, pastries, and environment all maintain their top-shelf qualities. inside seating room was always an issue, but not near as much anymore. And the places to sit are all very hip, cool set-ups - not just 10 look-a-like tables and chairs. 

My only problem? How they've laid out their customer flow. One prob at the old place was there was always an awkward bottleneck of people waiting for their drinks... and to my amazement, they've cloned the problem at their new place! Unreal! Whoever space-planned the new layout should be shot! ""i have an idea - because this place gets really busy, lets direct the long line of people into a little circle in front of the register, make this the same spot people wait for \/ pickup their drinks, and also the same place people use the condiment bar, and we'll have everyone awkwardly climbing over each other.

I just ordered hot coffee to stay [$2], which comes in a ceramic coffee cup and free refills! The coffee tasted very smooth and not bitter at all.

As usual the food and service was excellent. We have never failed to have a lovely experience at this restaurant. We have tried a number of the menu items and the only one that failed to please was the blackened catfish. It did not live up to the usual standards for taste. Last nigh 2 of our party ordered from the Gluten Free menu, which was exceptional, and both had the trout, exchanging the rice for mashed potatoes and adding glazed carrots, one of our faves.. The trout was done well and made a very tasty dinner. It is often difficult to find a good gluten free dish and sometimes restaurants fail to understand the necessity to make it truly gluten free which can result tin consequences for the diner who needs the dish to be gluten free. These dishes were delivered separately by the chef who confirmed that they were gluten free. The service at Charlestons is always exceptional and we left having had another pleasant experience.",1,0,1

1) Seating is always limited. Not even on a Tuesday night in July will this place be quiet and empty. Own that fact, love it, and keep looking.

2) The cocktails are phenomenal. There's no list of specialty cocktails. They go by requests for what you like, and make something that percolates in their brains all quick like. They also use beautiful glassware, which is really nice when you think about how rare that is.

3) It's actually kind of unfortunate that the cocktails eclipse the food. Lux is probably some of the best food you can get at its price point. If you think $19 for a steak is too much, just order it and keep in mind you'd pay $25 for cooking on that order at any other establishment. The same goes for literally everything else their fabulous cooks prepare. You can't go wrong with the soup, and I assure you the mac & cheese is a full meal.

4) They actually have newspapers! Real ones that you hold with your hands for the patrons to enjoy and leave behind! That basically makes Lux one of the most active town halls in the city of Phoenix.

5) They play full albums of good music, and not just rando indie bands people brag about having heard of. This is a place that appreciates Beyonce as much as all those weird bands whose names you can't remember.

There are a lot of things I don't understand about Lux. I don't get why people take selfies with their lattes. I don't understand why they have a DJ, but I'm glad he has a regular gig. I don't understand  why there are non-functional typewriters strewn about the place. But you know what? I keep coming back. We all keep coming back.",2,1,0

I'm not a coffee drinker, but was intrigued by the food and the atmosphere.  Not much for me to add to the numerous reviews about this place, but its pretty much as advertised.  Good food, quirky setup, crazy busy.  Its a coffee house first and foremost, but they also have a wine and cocktail bar.  Its a bakery that serves breakfast, but also has a lunch and dinner menu that changes regularly.  Sort of reminds me a little of La Grande Orange Grocery in that it has multiple personalities depending on the time of day.  Sometimes places that try to do everything well often don't do anything well.  But like LGO, this place is an exception.

I came here on a Saturday morning around 7am.  My timing was perfect as the crowds started streaming in shortly thereafter.  Parking can be a chore as there's maybe 15 spaces in their main lot, so be prepared to park along Turney Ave (which also happens to be overflow parking for the apartment complex next door).  You walk up towards the front counter and get teased by a smorgasbord of tantalizing pastries and can also order off the menu on the wall.  The sweet dutch pancake with fruit intrigued me so I grabbed that.  Also got sides of their bacon and hash, since those also seemed to be feature breakfast items.  Along with an OJ, total price for breakfast with tax came to about $18.  You order up front and pay, then seat yourself and wait for the kitchen to call out your name.  I can see how this could be troublesome when its busy.  While there's plenty of seating in back, the front area can get crowded and noisy really fast making it difficult to hear your order called out or navigate the throngs of patrons.  Fortunately, no such trouble for me this morning as I got my food within 10 minutes of ordering.

Sat down at the bar area up front (which is full stocked by the way).  The food was pretty solid.  The veggie hash was mostly potato, but you could pick up the carrots and other veggies mixed in.  The bacon was fantastic.  I'm not sure where they source it from, but the bacon strips were thick cut and the taste was nothing like your store brand bacon.  As for the pancake, mixed feelings on this.  A great assortment of fruit and they put on plenty of whipped cream on top.  The pancake itself was good, but honestly tasted like an afterthought.  It was super thin almost like a taco bowl and fell apart pretty easily when I cut into it.  Didn't hinder the taste at all, but the presentation was such that it was just sort of there.  Still, a tasty breakfast that left me full and satisfied.

I'll be back at some point for a lunch or dinner go round.  And next time I probably won't be able to resist those pastries.  Overall, I can see why this place is so popular with the CenPho crowd.  You'll see suits, students, and joggers alike in this place.  I can't speak to the coffee, but obviously Yelpers are pretty high on that here.  I would imagine the Brophy\/Xavier\/Central High students probably frequent this place regularly.  And yes I'm a little bummed this place wasn't around when I was a student across the street.",1,0,1

The place isn't well lit from the outside and I could not find any large signs to locate this place easily. The parking lot is small and is located at he back so you'll be entering through the back. There are two fairly large dips going from the street to the parking and back to the street so lowered cars should park on the street. It was even hard to clear with a standard car going at parking speed. 

The place was packed with lots of students when I visited. There were no empty tables or seats. The line for drinks was about 6 ppl deep but it moved fast. This place serves a wide variety of food and drinks from coffee to wine and from cakes\/pastries to cooked meals. This place is a one stop wonder. Get your breakfast lunch or dinner at the same spot.  The handcrafted coffee drinks selection is bigger than many places so you get lots of interesting choices. I had the velvet latte drink in a large size. I love the fact that you can pick larger sizes for a little bit more as opposed to other shops who don't give you that option. The velvet was fairly sweet tasting. I think it'll be better with a little less sweetness or probably an additional shot in this drink would do the trick. The drink tasted ok, not among the best lattes I've had but it was good enough.

I'm fortunate enough to live walking distance from there and it has become something like a second home. It's a coffee shop mixed with a wine bar, what more could you possibly ask for in one place?

Yes, parking is crazy, and yes, it is always packed, but once you find a seat, you often get lost in the people watching and the free iced tea refills and end up spending hours there. The reason it's always so packed is because the desserts are divine, as well as the breakfast, lunch, and dinner they make. Not to mention iced coffee refills are only $1. I've never not enjoyed whatever I've ordered there.

I've always noticed great service from the employees. Whenever I bring my cup back for a fifth or sixth refill of hibiscus iced tea (it's somewhat of an addiction), they gladly refill it for me. Although it's always packed and there's typically always a line, the employees keep their cool and try to serve everyone in a timely manner.

Whether you're looking for a place to meet with a friend, to study, to do work, or just to decompress after a long day, Lux is the place to go. I'd give it six stars if I could (mostly because free iced tea refills are awesome).",0,0,0

I saw just how many Yelp reviews Lux had and had to lay my preconceived notions about people from Phoenix and their snobbish ways aside (I'm from Tucson, can you blame me? We're all a bunch of dirty hippies in Baja Arizona). I stopped in on a recent trip up to Phoenix and enjoyed a croissant and a latte. 

I was immediately impressed with the vibe (wait, did I just use the word vibe... I think I did), even though I was a little surprised by it's location -- there's not much around it at all. Great music, great art and a laid back atmosphere that's conducive to just hanging out or perhaps writing the next great American novel.

The croissant was to die for, and the coffee was perfect -- apparently roasted on site.

I sat at the juice bar and watched an impressively mustached man create some very interesting drinks. I didn't stick around long, but I liked what I saw. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.

The only reason I didn't go ahead and give the full five stars was the initial frustration I had when ordering -- I'm no idiot, but the process wasn't intuitive and none of the staff seemed interested in helping me out. They were too busy updating their Instagram and talking about the next greatest band you've never heard of. That sort of bummed me out, but the yummy coffee soon made up for it.",3,2,1

My sister Jannette L. and I have been on a coffee shop kick lately and she digs latte art, so we were recommended to come here! Hearing that it has a lot of great tasting options we decided to come here. 

I must say it was quite hard to find since we didn't see any logos or anything that suggested this building was Lux, we kinda went in blind. 

Coming in, you definitely get the hipster vibe, which is cool, everything is esthetically pleasing, the atmosphere is chill, just meant for you to relax. I dig it. 

Coming up to the counter, the gentleman was nice and made sure to greet us, we ordered 2 Ghirardelli hot chocolates (yum) and a vanilla latte (also yum). We picked up 2 cup cakes as well, vanilla vanilla and chocolate espresso. The barista  got my friends hot chocolate wrong, whole milk instead of almond -1 star. I saw a peanut butter cake and recommended it to bestie Joyce W. (Queen of PB). So to make sure she asked the cashier if it was peanut butter cake or frosting, the gal replied with ""oh, it's peanut butter something"". -1 star, woah girl, you should know a little more about your job and customer service. 

The drinks were delightful, keeping us warm as we chit chatted and caught up. The pastries on the other hand, were dry and crumbling to touch. The treat were displayed open on plates behind a glass, no covering or anything preventing them from being exposed to air. I'll say it's fair game that it was 10pm and end of the day so I'll let Lux keep that star.

We all know the coffee and sweets are great but my real reason for writing is that I started eating the food recently... and it's phenomenal.  Obviously, not a huge menu, but there are only a few places in town that make really great inventive salads, and I'm kind of a snob.  I don't need a lot of choices as long as they're all good.  I have had 2 salads at Lux now and both of them were THE BEST.   My friend had the steak and it was better than the one he had ordered a couple nights prior at a steakhouse.  Almost silly. 

PS. 
I've got quite possibly the lamest (non existent) sense of style ever, but I'm not sure what people are talking about when they speak of ""hipster sneer"".  I get it... people who take their hip fashion trends seriously make you uncomfortable.. that's ok... just let them be, I promise that if they're being rude to you it's probably because you seem like a jerk and are giving off a bad vibe, not because they are super angry that you would step foot into their favorite establishment.

Finding this place can be a bit tasking for first-timers as it is easy to miss. When you do find the place, parking just adds on more stress. The place itself is always exceptionally busy, so expect a wait time to order. The good thing is they stay on top of things so it's not too bad. 

The cool parts: They serve alcohol. Food is fresh. Did I mention they serve alcohol? Also they are open till 2a for all those NIGHT RIDERS!!! (I am the Night Rider!!) 

The off putting parts: The place is busy which means finding a table can be impossible at times (including the back area). My biggest critique goes to their music. Their ""background music"" is obnoxiously loud. It feels like you're at a club and that is disappointing for a place like this. I go here to enjoy good food, coffee, and even conversation.

We were referred here by our awesome waiter Matt at the Henry for drinks. 
It was a Saturday night, about 10 pm and my boyfriend and I went dressed up (NY standard, not PHX standards) like we usually are to go out and needless to say the minute we stepped foot inside I felt a little out of place. But we forged through the coffee area to the back bar area. We found two cozy seats and were greeted. I have to say although I look very different then anyone working there and most people going there they were all very nice to us and helpful (which I cannot say of all ""hipster joints"" *cough* Cartel *Cough*). 
If you like a great cocktail and even to challenge your palate, You HAVE to go hear! They have all quality liquors and mixers and to make it even better, there is NO cocktail menu. They can make all the classics, but the fun part is telling them what you like and don't like in a drink and they will create fabulous concoction just for you! I am talking rose water, lavender, all kinds of herbs and unique flavor profiles and combinations. To make it better, the prices are reasonable! To get a fabulous hand-made cocktail with all top shelf and beyond liquors for $8-$10 is a great deal and  they don't use ice and ""fillers"" to cut you short, with a couple drinks you will feel, let's say, relaxed...
Now the Mac-n-cheese with Bacon and Jalapenos!!! YES! It is perfect. Great comfort food, you may feel guilty for having consumed all that fat BUT it is totally worth it and you will love every moment of it!
Their baked goods and coffee are also great.
The music however... I have been there when they played the whole collection of Metallica (Lord, help me)... It isn't always that awful, however I don't care for the music most restaurants play today, so I digress.

I saw that it came from a place called Lux Central in Phoenix, and when I looked it up on Yelp I noted its strong reviews and determined to eat there when I was in town. I dragged my husband across town with promises of brunch, not realizing the place was more of a coffee shop with food and booze than an actual restaurant.

We walked in and took a lap around the space, noting the lack of tables, and the near absence of available chairs. I don't think I've ever seen so many people with laptops in a coffee shop all at once, and I hail from L.A., land of the Starbucks screenplay. I liked the vibe of the place--pretty hip, even strikingly hipster, especially by Phoenix standards. Eclectic furniture, lots of art on the walls. There was a register for coffee, pastries, and hot food, and a separate bar in the back. We were looking to have more of a sit-down brunch, and actually left to go to Pane Bianco instead, only to find that there wasn't much for my picky husband to eat (no pizza at lunch). We circled back and ordered food and cocktails at the bar, then seated ourselves at a communal table.

Service, at least, was excellent. Our bartender, a young dude with blondish hair, acted as our waiter, too--wish I'd gotten his name, because he was helpful and friendly and generally wonderful. He ordered our food for us and brought it out, along with our drinks. He also made fantastic cocktails. I got my Bloody Mary and it was totally worth the journey. I have no idea what went into it, but it was spicy and flavorful, with depth and complexity, an umami bomb of a Bloody Mary in a mason jar with salt-frosted rim. Didn't hurt that it came garnished with pickled asparagus, green bean, and carrot, along with jalapeño slices and a fistful of candied bacon--out of control delicious. There was no cocktail menu, but our bartender asked what my husband was in the mood for, and fixed him a beautiful, balanced Aviation--a lavender-colored cocktail with gin, creme de violette, maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice, garnished with a fancy cocktail cherry.

The food was less exciting, but serviceable enough. I had Aunt Ida's Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits were buttery with a nice crumble, and I liked the hearty sausage gravy. My husband got some toast with butter and jam, and supplemented that with a croissant. He wasn't particularly impressed with any of it.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend Lux Central for its food, but it's a cool coffee shop with a knockout bar. I'd love to come back for another round of drinks next time I'm in Phoenix. I just wouldn't show up looking for a sit-down meal on an empty stomach.",8,8,7

I love the layout and aesthetic of the place (imagine boho chic: reclaimed wood tables, fresh flowers, original framed art, vintage porcelain plate and dishware, and surprisingly comfy modern artsy chairs & sofas).

On the flip side, I also saw Lux through the eyes of my family (including two immigrant Chinese parents and two self-described 'yuppies') which gave me quotable perspective on what it's like to lunch here when you're *not* at all affiliated with the Pabst-drinking, Godard-quoting population. Some notable quotes from the familia, for whom eating at Lux was basically a sociological adventure: 

""Why does everyone here have beards??""
""How can so many dirty people with long hair and tattoos afford to eat here?""
""How come everyone has a Mac? Aren't those expensive??""
""Why are we drinking out of mason jars?""

Truth.

That being said, I personally loved the atmosphere. As a traveler, Lux immediately colors my impression of Phoenix as very liveable and lovable. Because it's popular, it's quite crowded, and the hip hop is a few decibels too loud for my taste, but the space is well-divided into quiet study areas, dining areas, and hangout areas. There are also tons of great children's books to keep your young ones happy. Lux is not kid-friendly in the sense that there are tons of baristas speed-walking around, and it could be a danger zone for coffee spills... but my nieces had a great time occupying a couch, scarfing down mac 'n cheese, playing with their toys and reading books.

The lunch items and pastries were delicious- freshly baked and\/or cooked from high quality, well-selected ingredients. We had a godly pecan bar, a mixed berry corn muffin, bread pudding with fresh whipped cream, NY strip steak and baby arugula on grilled levain, the aforementioned mac 'n cheese, and a chai spice cookie, courtesy of the sweet barista who threw it in gratis, alongside my order for a dirty chai latte.

For the first time ever, I order my coffee and something sweet - for there. While in line, I eyed the sweets. I wasn't the only one, though. A little fly was having his fair share of sugar, flying from scone to muffin to cake. My heart dropped. Luckily, they had a few choices covered up in glass. I chose the massive, super-chocolate walnut brownie. 

Somehow, miraculously, I managed to carry two plates to the ""coffee condiment station."" I set the brownie down gingerly on the napkins. Then I balanced the coffee cup and saucer in my left hand.... while pouring cream slowly into the cup with my right. I made it almost to the door, when I decided to set the brownie plate down and sip the coffee below the rim - before it sloshed all over the place. It was a suspenseful, long walk and I didn't have a clue how I was going to turn the door handle and make it outside. I stepped aside and asked the people behind me to give me a hand. I don't think they heard me, but they held the door open long enough for me to slip outside... and into a wooden bench directly under the noon-hour sun. Wowza. 

Since it's always so hard to find a spot inside, I opted for out. My brownie began to melt. The hot coffee tasted great, but it did little to save me from the heat and the sweat beginning to collect down my spine. 

Needless to say, I tossed the coffee back like it was a cheap shot at a club, stuffed my brownie in the to-go bag I requested and practically jogged to my car, where I blasted the A\/C and drove away.

Upside of all this? I sliced my brownie into small pieces and shared it with my co-workers, who have not yet been to Lux, although I keep telling them to go... Looks like I brought Lux to them.",0,0,0

Usually Lux is busy, so good luck finding a seat. The atmosphere inside is great. Local art on their walls is constantly rotating. There are tons of electrical outlets which encourages using their free wifi!

If you go during lunch time do not miss out on stopping next door at Pane Bianco for some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.

Lux's pastries are good and they offer a verity of specialty bottled drinks. If you're a fan of iced tea try it with mango syrup - it's wonderful and not very many coffee shops I've been to have the mango syrup. It is my personal favorite. Also I love their soy velvet (a soy white mocha). Their smallest size is much smaller than average coffee shops - probably 8 ozs. But it's great if that's what you're looking for. All their lattes come with two shots of espresso, so you're only paying for more milk and syrup when you upsize, so buy according to how much you enjoy the flavor of espresso. 

Their drink prices may seem a little high, but they're worth it. Plus their menu is elegantly designed. Tax is included on the prices listed, which features price points either on the dollar or fifty cent. Purely simple!",1,0,1

The Cave Creek Coffeee Company near my house has been going downhill fast for years (the coffee now sucks that Dave the owner is gone, and the attitude has gotten much worse. If I see another over- aged Harley biker wanna be... I'm gonna puke lol), and lets face it - when you get past all the artsy visuals, ambiance, wi-fi and the rest...in the end it is about the quality in the cup. 

In that department LUX truly kicks ass as the best coffeee in this town on many levels.

LUX is serious coffee - from the freshly roasted beans on premisis to the perfectly foamed lattes with artisan leaves created within the foam (try to get that anywhere else in town, including at the overrated Presse)...the barristas here know their Joe and take no prisoners. 

The mocha's have just the right balance of bitter chocolate and sweeteness, without being cloying or over bearing and the result is a nice balance of flavors that flow past your tongue. 

I generally drink my espresso straight, and at LUX it is obvious that the perfectly toasted nutmeg colored crema that the barristas pull is long lasting and as good as anything you'll find in Italy or Seattle, As soon as you walk in the door you can inhale the fresh roased beans and the wonderful smells wafting throughout. 

The goodies and cakes here have generally been pretty yummy, but I come here for my Espresso fix and so do other serious espresso afficionados.

I noticed a few Yelpers deriding the ""crowd"" here as pretentious, but I have to totally disagree.Honestly I find the vibe refreshing compared to Cave Creek or Scottsdale pseudo\/Harley Davidson chic with coffee that tastes mediocre. Yes, many of the college crowd here have full arm tats or are pierced, and you might even mistake this for an Apple Computer laptop camp. But I have always found the LUX bar staff to be EXTREMELY friendly and helpful, especially a gal named Shadie (probably mis-spelled - from Sounth Africa). The people here are just hanging out, lying on the comfortable furniture, or even falling asleep after a good cup o Joe (figure that out!).

The music and regularly changed artwork is nearly always cool and hip.

There is a reason that the New York Times ranked LUX the #1 coffee spot in all of Phoenix last year - the Espresso here is the real sh@t.",1,1,2

I usually come here to study and truthfully it gets a little loud at times so bring earplugs or anything else to plug your ears with. And on weekends you may have trouble finding a seat cause the place is packed. This place needs more outlets and the wifi can be sketchy at times. That said though I have a lot of love for independent coffee shops this one included.

They make pretty good white hot chocolates here. If you get a chance try one of their italian creme sodas ( i like peach). However, good drinks is only half the battle for a coffee shop, the joint also needs good bakery goods. Now the great thing about Lux is that I am pretty sure they bake most if not all their goodies on the premises. Hence, sometimes when walking towards the bathroom area your nostrils are greeted with whiffs of deliciousness. (theres a joke in there somewhere) Their Mexican Tea Cookies are always a good bet, and are reasonably priced. What I also like about this place is that they have rewards cards which I made ample use of. The Baristas in general are pretty cool laid back folk.

I just have to say for the record, that i think their espresso gets better every single time I'm there.  Or maybe I just fall in love with it a little more each day! Seriously, shit is good.

I used to not be able to focus in here with all the 'scene-y' stuff (alluded to in other reviews) but now i've found that if i have work to do the noise and the people kind of make me motivated. It can get really dull working at your desk in your house.

I like that people hate so much on the mac-using, trendy people in the shop. Seriously? Who gives a shit? Unless they are mean to you or talk loudly about the previous nights parliament-smoking, pbr-drinking escapades - do you really care what kind of computer system they use and how skinny their jeans are? If so, I think it's time for a little introspection. But maybe i just take personal question to those reviews since i own a mac and am always working there :)

But either way - their pastries are divine, their espresso is excellent, and i have never in ALL of my visits to lux had a rude, pretentious, too-good, whatever barista. ever. they are really kind to everyone that ive ever watched order a drink.

i do get quite pissy however - when people sit down at shared tables and continue to cross, shift, and move themselves inevitably hitting the shared table about 8,000 times and spilling my coffee about 8,000 times. Come on folks, shared table...can i get a little consideration for your fellow coffee drinkers!?

My experience: 
It was very easy to find and I got lucky and got a nice parking spot in the front as someone was leaving.
When I entered, it was a bit intimidating. There were people on their laptops and others just conversing and relaxing. When I finally figured out where the line was, I ordered a quiche lorraine, which was way too costy. For one small slide, it is $5! I can get an entire quiche for that price elsewhere. I wasn't sure which coffee to go with, but the cashier at the front was helpful. I got the cafe mocha. I specifically asked for it to be extra hot because that's the way I like my coffee and asked  to warm up my quiche as well. 
In less than a minute,  my mocha was ready, so I doubted that it was extra hot as I requested. Not to my surprise,  by the time they brought out my supposedly warm quiche, my mocha was pretty much cold! The quiche was also served cold, so I'm not sure why it took them so long to serve it to me (they were supposed to warm it up). Quiche Lorraines are usually served hot--not at lux apparently.  This saddened me because I was really craving one. I ate it, slowly.  It was not delicious but it was good. The mocha would have been better had it been hot.
Other than that, the vibe and atmosphere was not bad. Just a lot of college kids. I don't mind but....
Anyway, I like the typewriters as centerpieces,--pretty cool. I was hoping to make this place my ""to-go cafe joint"" but I'm not sure it's my type. A bit too crowded for me particularly.  I like more laid back type of cafes....

-Definitely not the most intuitively arranged coffee shop I've ever been to. The space offered for your 5 minute wait for your cup of coffee is cramped.
-I've only been there four times, but three of those four were unpleasant experiences. They either messed up my drink, forgot to give me my food, or served me improperly prepared (very bitter) coffee. The last time I visited (my 4th time, in total) I ordered a decaf americano, and I was pleasantly surprised. After last time, I'm going to give them another chance.
-Parking. Is. A. Nightmare.

On the plus side, they have really good dinner foods (mac n cheese) and an (overpriced) wine bar, if you're into that scene\/old enough to enjoy that.

Why I updated my review to include a third star:

I visited an old friend for coffee, and she insisted we go to Lux, because she really likes it there. So, we went, and I got a simple cup of their light roast coffee (only $2. Not horribly expensive.) and was, once again, pleasantly surprised. It was smooth enough to drink without cream, milk or sugar. 
It was a Friday at lunch time, and it wasn't so busy. There was room to sit down, room to talk, room to wait for my cup of coffee without worrying about stepping on others' toes.
It was my first actual \/nice\/ experience at Lux, and I'm happy about it.",6,2,0

First, Lux desserts are painfully perfect.  I've had the carrot cake, choc chip blondie, m and m cookie, etc etc. apple something, salted caramel something else...and each time I make the remark.. ""I could literally crush every last one of those f-ing desserts and never look back"".  Scary good.. Soft... Insane. 
Second, the sugar free caramel latte iced or hot with the dope leaf design in the foam- thumbs up.  Sizes are one stage smaller than most places but I'll take it if it lets them stay open and profitable.  
Oh ya open late!!!!! Till midnight thru the week and 2 on the weekends.  Finally!  Xtreme bean is the only other contender.

Chester thinks the adorable baristas made a poopy day much better. The girl up front gave him such a nice complement and didn't rush Chester like they do at Sh*tbucks. It's amazing what a smile and good cup of coffee can do for Chesters' mental health. Thank you, Lux lady.

Served in a giant coffee mug, it was covered with a generous pile of warm toasted pecans and juicy raspberries, with a mingling of raspberry juice and (I think) maple syrup to sweeten the oats underneath.

I still ultimately love most things about this cafe and have probably been here more times then I can remember.

The reason behind the dropped star is that I've noticed that the workers can be a bit short and the food a bit too salty. Heavy seasoning hands on the chefs here. I ordered the Yorkshire Pudding Burger with Beet chips and though the Yorkshire pudding, aioli and beet chips were tasty the burger patty itself was too salty. The Yorkshire pudding seemed a bit too tough, kind of expected a more flaky texture and the patty cooked a bit over to my ""Medium Rare"" preference though stated during my order.

Alas, if there's one thing you should order here besides the pastries and other dishes on their changing menu it's their Mac & Cheese. It's not the nostalgic bright, orange Mac N Cheese that comes in a blue and yellow box ... but it is definitely next level. Perfectly cooked macaroni, creamy and gooey, melty cheese sauce. I also got mine with bacon and jalapeños, which gave it a bit of heat and a smokey, saltiness from the bacon.

Conveniently located on Central between IndianSchool and Camelback, right in front of the light rail. (don't miss it, its a hidden gem)  My friend suggested Lux and I was pleasantly surprised walking into what seemed to be some sort of old warehouse that had been turned into a fun laid back coffee shop\/restaurant. There were so many people relaxing enjoying coffee with friends, people on their laptops studying and working and a bar full of laughter enjoying cocktails and food. I had a vanilla latte accompanied by a tasty lemon bar which is made fresh in the kitchen everyday and the menu is always changing. Lux roasts their coffee in house so the aroma when you walk in is absolutely amazing. This seems to be a great place to go if you are new in town and want to meet new people. The atmosphere is very young and friendly, lots of college students. 
I will definitely be returning!

Service: Friendly staff, order up counter

What We Liked: 
-Atmosphere: trendy, industrial, eclectic, good environment for studying (which many people were doing - I would as well). Unusual open concept kitchen with basket of food along the counters which worked with the atmosphere.
-Espresso: smooth espresso! The Quattro con panna was delicious with the smallest hint of sweetness and nice smooth espresso. Made me want to try all of their coffee concoctions. 
-Options for coffee and wine: I like this combination and it was executed well in the building itself, being somewhat separate from each other
-Baked good: a good ol' choc chip cookie. Not much more to say about a cookie. :) 

What We Disliked:
-Not much. Just maybe the cleanliness. 

Overall, a hip ""young"" place packed with 20 and early 30-somethings. Most people were studying with their laptops at all the eclectic tables. It seems like a place to meet new people and the vibe was casual and friendly. The tables, seating and building itself is certainly rough around the edges but it works for this place.

My friend who is visiting for a rotation told me he goes here to study for his boards. Love the decor, vibe, but most importantly, the food!

My friend had the yogurt and granola, I had a strawberry thumbprint cookie, and we each got vanilla lattes. Coffee here is smooth, not bitter, and they top it off with a design in the foam! Lovin' it! 

This place is HUGE even though it doesn't look that way from the outside. Plenty of places to sit with your Macbook or a novel and Free Wifi.  I went on a weekend so it was packed, like line-out-the-door packed, but I still didn't have to wait too long to find a place to sit and study.

Forgive me, Lux Coffeebar, but I think I got so distracted by COMPLAINING about OTHER places, that I have not had the chance to shower you with accolades. 

Lux Coffeebar is by far, the best coffee in downtown\/central Phoenix. They are consistent, offer a full espresso menu, and actually KNOW what a real macchiatto is. They offer a vast selection of in-house baked goods that are always incredibly satisfying and they are located right off the light rail next to one of the best lunch locations in the city (Pane Bianco). Their prices are low-normal and their interior is bright, clean, and full of local art. While their sleek, mod-inspired furniture may be intimidating to some (on first glance it  looks a little snotty), Lux is like a second home to me and has always been welcoming and comfortable. Its regular patrons are the type of people who will leave you alone if you're working on something on your laptop, but are always friendly for some conversation if you're feeling lonesome. It's good for meeting people and for studying, and the baristas are some of the best I have ever met in both skill and personality. They roast their beans in-house and also offer their coffee for home brewing. Owner Jeff Fischer (who is great with remembering names of regulars) is on the premises DAILY working both behind the bar and making fresh deliveries to his business of fresh fruit and ingredients for their wonderful tarts and other goodies. His wife Tara often brings over their little ones and over time you see that this hip location is really a down-to-earth family business in disguise. They even have a nice selection of glass-bottled sodas (real cane sugar only) and designer water. During the summer, their lemonade really hits the spot. Versatile, stylish, and full of that small-local business charm, Lux is one of the only places I will really, really, really miss when I relocate to California next month.

I went twice in the course of a couple of weeks and the trips averaged a rating of ""eh.""

Trip #1: Girl barista is nice, suggests upsizing from a small-sized chai latte to a medium because the small is only slightly larger than a shot glass.  It's midweek in the p.m. so the place isn't too busy, making it a nice place to relax.  Sadly, the chai is lackluster.  It tastes kind of watered down.  My friend has the Velvet, which is way better.  When it's time to leave, there is some confusion as to where the garbage can is located (Answer: way in the back).

Trip #2: Guy barista is a bit snotty.  Again it's suggested that I upsize to the medium (why even have the small really?) and then is a bit pissy when I tell him I really only want the Velvet in a small.  I say no thank you to the whipped cream, trying to muster some sort of self-control.  When I go to pick up my drink, the barista is putting some whipped cream on my friend's drink.  ""The whipped cream is really good,"" he tells me.  I hesitate, watching him dole out the tasty confection and he sees me.  ""You already said no,"" he says as he closes up the container and smugly puts it back under the counter.  Now, maybe he's trying to be funny, but if that's the case, he needs to work on his delivery because it just comes off as being snotty.  The place is full of people tonight.  My friend and I sit on the white chairs up towards the front.  There are dirty plates and cups on all the tables and everything is just a bit askew.  It just feels a bit grimy.  My Velvet is only okay.  It's probably much better with the whipped cream.

Overall, I just kind of got a pretentious vibe from the place.  I feel like I can get a tastier Chai and way less attitude over at Copper Star.",3,2,2

Today it rained all day and as rare as that is, I feel a covered patio is even more coveted in the hot summer months.  I believe a coffee shop should have a covered patio.  As a coffee bar, I wish the coffee was better, not saying it is bad, just not the best.

I think Lux is the answer for Phoenix's market for  coffee connoisseurship and boutique roasting. 

Lux is industrial chic. Vintage industrial with soft touches of retro typewriters on tables. Its a muted scream of modernism without trying to hard. It's so effortlessly cool, clean, simple. The front side of the building facing East is all brick and hard to tell that there's even an awesome business running, let alone of what nature. Seems almost as if you have to be in the ""know"" to find it and hear about it. 

Everywhere are cute hipster boys and girls which makes me fall in love and turn into a total creep peering and drooling not so secretly. The bar is a nice touch that was much needed and I'm glad they've now incorporated that into the place. 

Coffee comes at the perfect temperature- not too hot where beans burn and leave a bitter sharp lingering muddle. The latte art is cool and a nice touch. You can get your coffe as a drip, chemex, French press.  Not sure about hario pour over or aeropress although I think they do have that option (unless I'm mistaken for a diff coffee shop in Phx area that offers that too)

Quality coffee is definitely prevalent. They roast their own coffee so you know it's fresh. The foam is always light and fluffy and not filled with too dense bubbles. Definitely lickable. They offer almond milk which is so refreshing as an alternative to soy. 

The music can get loud sometimes so I tend to venture into the back patio. I haven't tried Lux's food but I'm sure it is up there, and if not, Pane Bianco right is next door.

My only one complaint (which I could care less about also) is that the line is a little akward when it gets backed up into the entrance but sometimes runs also into the middle of the room.",3,2,0

It's beautiful inside and if you like standing around waiting for a place to sit or crowded around the register then this is the place for you!

Breakfast here is really good though. I go to church across the street and sometimes we stop in here after for a bite. The bacon and eggs with a croissant are the perfect little tummy fill for a day of meandering around midtown.

We normally grind beans and brew our own coffee in the morning, and rotate between Starbucks beans and beans from specialty coffee roasters. I wanted to try a latte or macchiato, but since we were in a hurry we went with the Large House Coffee (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lux-phoenix?select=jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ#jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ), which was a very light and drinkable coffee. It wasn't as flavorful as the coffee I had later on from Cartel. I regret not purchasing beans from Lux to bring home and try, but will have to make sure I do that on my next visit to Arizona. Lux also sells a variety of baked goods, and I purchased a slice of the Raspberry Almond Buckle (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lux-phoenix?select=jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ#WXpjlFSUd3EhNgePXJO_Lw) which was DELICIOUS. I loved the almond-y taste of the buckle, and the fluffiness of the cake. The raspberries also added a slight tartiness which was really nice. 

Lux also serves breakfast (along with lunch and dinner), and the menu looked really good! The majority of people in line were ordering breakfast items, so I'm assuming they have some solid dishes. There was a line when I first entered, but it moved pretty quickly. There were plenty of tables to sit at, and it seems like a great place to relax with friends, study, or browse the internet.

Coffee: Really pretty good. I'd been to some pretty good places back in CA, so have some pretty high standards regarding good coffee. I think Lux does a pretty decent job. The drip coffee and iced teas have free refills.

Food: A little pricey, but the food is always pretty good. Their macaroni and cheese is cheap, though, and awesome (5 bucks). You can get it with jalapeno and bacon (7 bucks). Sometimes, they even have pesto and chicken in it. They start serving dinner at 5:30. Their breakfast is always pretty good, too, and they always have a variety of different quiches.

Staff: All pretty nice and the more you come there, the more social they will be with you. If any even minor inconvenience arises, they're pretty good about spotting the charge, but it rarely happens that they have to do that. 

Environment: Yes, there are a ton of hipsters there, but that's kind of to be expected with good coffee shops in any city. There's a lot of people studying, but there are people meeting socially throughout the coffee shop, as well and especially near the bar area. Plenty of outlets exist for you to plug into.

I ate there last night, and for me, it was a Jekyll & Hyde experience for me.  I ate there four weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience.  I had Emily as a server, I asked for a couple of substitutions on the three meals I ordered and she was very accommodating and very friendly.  She even, without my asking, gave me quite a bit of their wonderful pizza bread to bring.  The bread is a real treat.

Last night, however, Emily wasn't working and my server was an older fellow who paid very little attention to me.  I constantly needed to ask for refills on my Iced Tea.  Unlike Emily who was always watching my table and at least three times during my meal, she asked if everything was OK.  No such luck last night.

To top everything off, one of the substitutions I requested was for meat sauce instead of marinara sauce on the ravioli dish I took home.  The server said OK and I thought it was.  But, when my bill came, I was charged $3.50 for a side of Bolognese sauce.  When I asked what that was for, the server told me that meat sauce was more expensive than marinara and that was what the charge was for.  I was floored - Emily didn't do that I said.  But he insisted.  I told him, that if there was an upcharge he should have told me up front.  I left an angry man, and my tip reflected that

When I got home, while putting away my two extra meals, they felt lighter to me.  I opened the containers, and sure enough the portions were about  the size they were on my first visit.

I am really confused about the difference.  But Vivala Emely!!!!!!!",0,0,0

The place is easy to find and had lots of seating inside.   Looked like they were remodeling a patio outside which will be nice seating in the summer.   

First the coffee is good.  If you are looking for coffee this is a good place.  It is also a decent place to hang out with friends.  Plenty of seating with music in the back ground.  I would have to give 5 stars for this.  

The food was ok to me.  My wife liked her quiche and that's where we compromised on the rating.  I thought the food had a decent taste but the portions were small for what the prices were.  I don't mind paying more for food as long as there is some knock your socks off flavor but that just didn't happen.  

I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage.  It came with 1 biscuit and runny gravy with a little bit of sausage.  Just didn't cut it for me.  I even ordered a side of hash browns that were pretty skimpy too.

Any given time you go to Lux you should expect a few things:

First, an insane amount of people crammed in to every nook and cranny of this eclectic space. People from all walks of life line up to get their coffee.  Seats are insanely difficult to come by.  People smell bad many times, and everyone is very occupied with what they are doing. The DJ in the corner is playing some strange granola-y music that you've never heard but makes you feel cool just listening to it.  Atmosphere is ON POINT and LIT and all that. 

Whoops, what really should have been first was the insane parking situation.  There are rarely spots in the lot, so you might have to park on the street, which, really I would recommend first since the lot is a bit toxic (last time I squeezed into a spot there I was greeted with a nice note filled with expletives from my parking neighbor talking about how he should have scratched my door, etc. for parking so close to him). 

Really, these two first points just add to the appeal of Lux, because it makes it feel that much more urban.

The coffee is great here.  The light roast is on point.  However, you haven't lived until you've asked for some ""whip"" in your coffee.  Just do it.  (My aunt always asks for a ""'skosh of whip"" and is known as the skosh lady for that reason).  My only gripe with this part Lux is the fact that an ""iced coffee"" costs like $4 or something insane like that.  I think they just pour a double shot of espresso over ice, but really that is an insane price.  It's tasty, but I'd almost rather get hot coffee and ask for a cup of ice.....

The pastries and baked goods are great and there is always an assortment to choose from.  They also have a full breakfast and lunch menu and everything I've had is great. I've vowed to my wife that one day I will splurge and spend my savings account on the NY Strip and eggs menu item. 

Anyways, Lux is awesome, and if you don't like it you're probably wrong, because it's the type of place that you should like even if you don't like it.  Mostly because they have identity and understand what they are.  I think that's cool.",2,0,3

I have been going to Lux consistently for the last year. Unless I am out of town or sick I can be found there on a weekly basis. I live in Old Town Scottsdale and I literally drive completely out of my way to indulge in the deliciousness that is Lux!

From the wonderful coffee to the mouthwatering quiche that insists on haunting my dreams, I just cannot get enough!  It is hands down the best coffee I have ever had in the Valley.  Aside from the quality of their food and coffee drinks the staff is nothing short of amazing. Make sure that when you arrive you give Jency, Eric, Noel and Jeff some serious love - for they are coffee Gods!

My only little complaint was that the girl who rang up my coffee was lacking in the people skills arena. I mean, we get it, you're tatted up and you don't conform, but it's still a busines and I'm still a customer -- and I'm spending money. I would expect her to at least give the appearance that she likes working there. A smile or a little intro to this place would have been appreciated. I tipped her a buck too, which I would bet most of the hipsters don't do. That said, there are tons of seating options here, all arranged quite well.

I have been going to Lux quite frequently since they moved to their new location. I love the layout, the decor, the staff, the coffee and bar drinks, their baked goods - at least I did until I tried the cookies. They were not cheap ($1 a piece and not particularly large), but I believe in spending a bit more for small business's sake and good quality. That's why I was so disappointed. The coconut macaroons were so hard that they completely crumbled when biting into them. I am still not sure if they were just old or just poorly made. The pistachio divinity on the other hand so sweet that even I, who has never met a carbohydrate she has not liked, could not eat them. I picked out the pistachios and threw the rest away.

The edibles looked amazing, but was a little disappointed with the chocolate and cinnamon donuts I picked up for my family to try.  

I ordered a double cappuccino, as it's my go to, did not sweeten it as it was easily enjoyed by itself.

Love seeing these small companies roast their own beans on site.  Love the fact they are taking great care with the roasting process.  Thank you for not burning the bean and making my beverage it so enjoyable.

After driving around and finally finding the sign for the place I had a hard time figuring out what building it was in; there was no sign indicating which of the two buildings it was in. After I tried opening a locked door to a restaurant, I realized it was the other building. I walked in and saw academic hipster chicks and dudes in square black rimmed glasses studying on their MacBooks and listening to their iPods. They stared at me as if I was disturbing the some silence. I knew it was this kind of place. It's why I came here. Hipsters have good taste in cafes.

I made my way to the counter looking for a menu and was distracted by the glass window of mega pastries, all of which will make your ass so fat, so you will have to run a marathon after brunch otherwise. I still didn't see a menu and I was famished. Looking around I noticed a dude dandied up in his tucked in red flannel, combed beard and slicked back hair pressing orange after orange into a giant, clear vat, and girls sitting at the mimosa bar in front of him watching the show. ""How Portland!"" I thought. 

Finally, I saw a white piece of paper taped to the glass window. one font. one menu. no categories. beans. espresso. cappuccino. eggs. oatmeal. hash browns. etc. I just wanted a coffee and food. I couldn't read it fast enough to decide what I wanted, and I didn't want a bag of beans for breakfast. I ordered oatmeal w fruit + nuts because apparently Lux isn't hipster enough to add anything vegan to the menu. My total: $9. Coffee and oatmeal anywhere should never exceed $5 and should never be cheaper than $3.

I turned to find a place to sit and confused as to where I needed to pick up my oatmeal order when I saw a man smashed between some speakers playing music without words from his laptop. Some of the sounds relaxed and hypnotized me, while others caused me anxiety so much that I had to pee. I found the bathroom after I discovered there were other lounging rooms to eat in, one of which resembled an administrative office for an art school complete with projector and typewriter. Everything was color coordinated in turquoise, white, and accessorized with wooden ""coffee table"" stumps. 

I sat down in a corner on a pleather couch and tried to slurp my steel cut oats  liquified in a cappuccino mug with a giant soup spoon. In the other hand I'd swap the spoon for the other cappuccino mug with coffee. Double fisting cappuccino mugs was my performance art for the day. Men stared.

I felt increasingly uncomfortable. The history channel was playing on the wall where my head was. Families stared at me as they walked by. I had to move, so I stood up, walked around slurping oatmeal, and watched the people on the back patio speaking with their hands. I felt as if I had to walk around and look at art and enjoy the hip design of the space instead of sit, which also seemed inappropriate as it distracted other patrons. I tried reading a magazine, but I was too distracted by others' movement and the music, so I felt I should just leave. The dark blend coffee was perfect. I poured it in a paper cup.",0,0,0

My favorites are the brioche slices with jam and the honey bran muffins....and the mexican wedding cookies.....and the lemon bars. Service is always quite friendly and fast. They have just plain cool people working here. This place runs smoothly.

So then why just 3 stars A-oK? I'm totally on LUX's side! Good service, tasty coffee and nice bites....but here's why:

The computer people. There are faaaar too many computer folk at this place taking up waaayyy too much room. And they're not considerate enough to just go home after three hours. Now, before anybody has a coronary - just know that I'm aware that computers are a part of our everyday lives now (I guess) and people don't have to be confined at home to study blah blah blah but COME ON. This is a social atmosphere - designed to chat and laugh and make new friends and have coffee. If you're ordering one cup of tea and stretching it out over several hours while taking a seat that somebody with a pulse and some social skills could be occupying - that's just rude.

This place needs to 86 the free Wi-Fi and let people pay for limited times of web access. Period. LUX used to be more of a social atmosphere, but they've caved into the laptop ""nesters"" and set no guidelines whatsoever. So most days you walk in, and the only sound is the music, because nobody is talking. Instead there are over-serious, glossy-eyed lumps of what used to be humans doing their research papers for college or googling themselves or updating their facebook status every three minutes because they're bored and nobody wants to talk to them. And staring you down as you come in like you're invading THEIR space.

Nesters....go HOME. If you can't study without being in this environment from dusk til dawn, maybe you're not that interested in what your'e studying - which might mean your'e in the wrong major. Or your concentration just sucks ass. You can't have your brioche and eat it, too.

+ Your 8 Binders

Definitely hipster heaven as everyone already pointed out. Great atmosphere but can be pretty loud if you can't tune out sounds.  Internet was fast. I came during lunch rush so it was pretty packed and awkward to squeeze into an empty chair.  As people left, it became more manageable. Great for people watching without looking like a creeper (I swear I'm not a stalker though).

Sizes of drinks ran a little small - $5.50 for large dirty chai.  The baked goods looked amazing but I was on a diet and a budget. Great to see cooks right behind the counter making fresh food orders and throwing pastries into the oven. My olfactory nerves were in overdrive. 

Only one bathroom of each gender so there were waits at times.  Rooms in the back were a bit quieter than the front but still busy. I also like that they have a bar if you're looking for a drink with some extra kick.

Minus a star because workers seemed a bit robotic.  Maybe it's their job to be efficient but a little personable touches in taking orders can't be that hard to add. They weren't mean or rude or anything, just a little stoic for what I'd expect from an otherwise cool place such as this.",2,1,3

I debated all the way from Chandler where I could grab a bite to eat before the game I was attending. I didn't want to deal with waiters or waiting. I'm mainly a morning Lux patron but today I decided on dinner. I've already had the burger, steak, Mac and cheese etc. today I decided on the Tender Pork Belly BLT and mixed greens. 
It was the perfect blend. To start, the artisan bread had flavor. Too often restaurants take for granted sides or basic ingredients. At LUX, if it doesn't improve the dish, they don't use it. No microwave here. Just the right amount of Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato with some type of aoli. This is so important. Some places don't focus on the taste but go for a big huge sandwhich filled with one ingredient over all the others. Well.... my big huge sandwhich blended perfectly without trying to pile it on for looks instead of taste. The vinagarette for the mixed greens is outstanding. 
I wasn't in a particularly happy mood upon arrival but the down to earth cashier broke out a smile when he greeted me and changed my demeanor. And a double chocolate chip cookie for dessert. 
Overall, I am glad I stopped in and am adding dinner at Lux to my options.

Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they ""only pull double shots"" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service.

The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back. 

If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work.

Lux has everything I can imagine for a coffee shop. Freshly roasted beans, baristas who know what they're doing, (AND look like they're having a good time doing it), an outdoor shaded patio with funky wood tables and indoor seating with mismatched modern chairs, delicious baked goods (some guiltier than others), beautiful local artwork on the walls (a photography display today), and an actual DJ playing music for the lingerers' enjoyment! It goes without saying that the coffee is delicious. 
Both times I went in, the guy at the counter offered advice on my choices (the scone he suggested was indeed delicious, not overly sweet, but perfectly buttery), and no one pressured me to get through the line, as often happens at other places where people have their order down pat. I also enjoyed the company of other Lux patrons both times I went, and savored my coffee outside on the patio with a good book.",0,0,1

Parking can be difficult to find as the lot is shared with Pane Bianco. There are also street parking available on the right side of the building if the private parking is full. Be expected to wait in a long line that moves rather quickly (less than 8 mins). Bring your A game if you're planning to find a seat around peak hours, e.g. noon on a Saturday. There is a lot of hustle and bustle as you will find students studying with their books\/laptops, coffee lovers getting their daily dose of caffeine, and hungry people grabbing breakfast\/lunch. Planning to catch some sunshine? Have no fear as there is outdoor seating to the rescue. While waiting in line, I often look forward to grabbing one of the postcards on the counter. The Lux postcards are different every time I come in, which keeps it fun. 

I love the coffee and latte art. My all-time favorite is the iced hazelnut latte, a smooth drink with the perfect balance of creaminess and sweetness. The velvet latte also hits the spot. All of their freshly made desserts always catch my attention every time I'm waiting in line. I really enjoy getting their package of 3 chocolate chip cookies that is cutely packaged and convenient for on the go. They have a good selection of breakfast\/lunch that is popular amongst the regulars. I have yet to try their food. 

If you're planning to study there, plan to bring headphones. It can get very distracting and loud with people conversing and walking in & out. They do not have a lot of single tables. Plan to get comfortable and meet a new friend on those long group tables. Wifi is available. 

I will continue to return for their awesome coffee and mouth-watering sweets.",6,4,4

It's one of those places where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffee - and they don't care. They are trying so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about customer service. They just need to re-think they way they operate, and I think they would rock, since the coffee is very good. The food is just average, however. My biggest complaint is that there is one dark haired short girl that works there that just seems out of it and rude. She does't look at you when you order, and then end up making you repeat yourself several times. Also - she's not very polite. Maybe I just wasn't hipster enough for her.

Inside Lux it's loud, busy, chaotic, and so wonderfully fragrant. The line is confusing, but just follow everyone else's lead and you'll figure it out in no time. I'm not usually a latte person, but I quite enjoy them at Lux. Maybe it's a psychological effect of the cute latte art. I love their hash with poached eggs, and I'm pretty sure there is crack in the bacon. You can sit inside or outside in front of Pane Bianco next door. 

Last time I was in there I ordered a latte and espresso cupcake and instead I received a latte and espresso. I told the barista of the error and she didn't even bat an eye - acknowledged the error and quickly got me a cupcake. No harm, no foul. I don't want baristas who are sugary sweet and ooze with typical fake customer service. I can get that at Starbucks (along with burnt coffee, but that's another review). We're adults here. Just do your job and when mistakes happen quickly fix it. So while other people may complain that the baristas are rude, I quite appreciate the honesty.

I don't understand it. I was so hesitant on coming here because I was afraid of this. 

I walked in, no one was in line. So I walked up to the cash register. Stood for a minute while the girl rang someone up. Finally a young man helped me, but first he just felt the need to educate me at how it works at LUX. Instead of, ""Hi, what can I get for you!?"" I got a, ""Just so you know the line starts back at the glass, what can I get for you?"" Really!? Is this real life!? How about the line starts wherever the heck your customer wants it to start, because I am paying your paycheck. Nonetheless, I was now at the cash register and realized he didn't ask how I wanted my tea. I then asked  the girl at the register if I can get creme in my tea, and the girl annoyingly told me I could do it myself. Stood and waited for my tea, and realized they must not call out your order at LUX. I walked up to the register (because why would you have a place to pick up your drinks?) and asked if these were mine, which took 3 tries before she yelled at me, ""yeah!""

College hipsters that wanted to sit in their loneliness, but at the same time being seen - because whats more important than being seen right? If you just wanted to be alone, you could go to a dive bar.. but today's ideals thrives on attention. 

It is almost that if there was a coffee shop\/laboratory where you could enjoy your beverage alone but in public display.. I am not even sure where I am going with this. It is sad though that people rather text than interact on person.

The coffee bar has interesting elaborate concoctions with more or less actual coffee in them. You can have your coffee with milk, flavors and\/or soda. That's how it is, and I had myself some nice big flavory cup of something that was sweet and caffeine laced. I would come back here, even if I do not understand the hype. here comes those who wants to experience the act of breaking the mainstream, but joining another mainstream movements that is almost as big as the original mainstream - but with even more rules and expectations.

Lux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones. They've also got killer pastries, and if you time it right, you'll get them fresh out da oven.

Since I obviously can't do that, I am always hoping that I can find a place locally that can re-create that nonchalant but cultured atmosphere so prevalent in European establishments and, of course, make some damn good espresso. 

Lux definitely gets some points for approximating the refined but casual feel of cafes and coffee shops in places like New York and Paris, and I very much appreciate places that remind us that eating and drinking are just as much an experience as they are about refueling quickly before we go off to our next daily task. However, because ""la dolce vita"" is not just about atmosphere but is also about taste and quality, I have to express my disappointment in the espresso we were served. It just wasn't that good. It was quite bitter, in fact, and it left a bit of a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I kind of expected more from the hype (and from the fact that I paid $2.50 for it). 

To be fair to Lux, I've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits. In any event, it's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the Starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible.",7,4,6

Remember that feeling when Ariel sang ""A Whole New World""?  

When Aladdin promised Jasmine that he would show her the world?

When Arnold promised his men in the hit movie, the Predator, that ""if it bleeds, we can kill it""?

This explains how my heart feels when I come here.  I order the Chai Latte, to which the chai is made in store, and I feel as if I have completed the tri-force.  When I order a moscow mule, they are out of mint, and the mixologist says that he has been experimenting with cucumber and cinnamon blend that he highly recommends and all of a sudden I know kung-fu and I see 0's and 1's, I know that I have hit a special place.  

Lux does what you want it to do.  They bake, cook, sauté, brew, and mix everything this world has to offer and the next.  They have a wide assortment of beers, make killer desserts and they dinner menu is varied.  According to Ashley N. (2014), they make the best Mac and Chee which I must confess is mad suspect considering the Tuck Shop winter menu exists in this fair city.  Obey your thirst.

XOXO,

I asked the guy if they had croissants and he looked quizzically at me. After a pause he told me that they did have them earlier in the morning. Another pause and he told me he would check to see if there were more. 

He then stood there staring at me for maybe 8 seconds. I decided to play the game and stared back. We were locked in eye contact for maybe 8 seconds. He then sneered and found the croissants. 

He was very questioning of taking them to-go and seem very confused and disgusted while putting them in the to-go box. 

The young woman at the cash register never made eye contact and, like the croissant guy, looked befuddled and annoyed by my standing at the counter and ordering croissants. Swiping my card was a a chore for her and handing it back to looked arduous for her.

And, if you go somewhere else, I won't have to worry about bumping anyone in the back or head as I make my way around to get coffee, find a magazine, power outlet or simply leave for the night.  

Oh, and despite the excellence of the food - there's a Carls JR down the road. Save yourselves the wait and just go there.  Ya. So there's room for the rest of us.  Trust me, it is almost as entertaining to watch the short-order cooks of McDonald's chaotic endeavor to make your burger vs. the smooth staff here cook from scratch in their front-of-room kitchen.  With the bowls of fresh, organic vegetables. And happy dispositions.  Yep. the experience here is completely overrated.  The fact there are fun mis-matched chairs and unique tables can be sat in at any thrift store, just bring your own Circle-K coffee and you're almost close to an attempt to recreate the Lux experience.  So...go there instead. 

And the bar? Well, despite it being awesomely stocked and super cool, you can get almost, if you pretend hard enough, the same experience in your local dive bar.  You know, the one that stinks and provides the singular experience of having your shoes stick to their floors.  You certainly will not experience that at Lux, and that would simply be a shame.  Robbery of a unique cultural experience. Similar to getting stuck in an over-the-border brothel.

And if you are a creative, or a thinker, or are otherwise of any intellectual capacity, you will find LUX a redundancy of conversational inspiration.  It will provide zero challenge for you to gaze upon. There is simply an overload of sensory happiness at Lux. It could quite certainly and seriously be dangerous to your health if you have a pacemaker or are otherwise easily over stimulated by goodness.

I was dragged here by a friend a few years ago, before the remodel\/expansion, and I HATED it here. The girl that took my order was snobby. The line was long and awkward, and I wasn't impressed by the drip I received. 

Over the years I'd get pulled here by various friends, and it never failed to piss me off. There's no sign. It's difficult to find. Where the DOOR? Where do you order what? I didn't understand the craze.

Lux is esoteric. It's snobby. It's hip. And it has grown on me. 

The quality the last six months or so has shot way up. Rumor is they have a new roaster, and goddamn, GODDAMN, if he isn't good. When I buy beans to take home, my entire kitchen is swallowed in that sweet smell.

Hipster-ish? God damn right, but I'm the furthest thing from hipster and I felt no less love while I was there.  Seems fat white doodz with their bohemian children in tow (bohemian = I let my kid get dressed in the dark) are just as welcome.

It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by an eatery;  Lot-o-hype seems to be circulating about Lux - possibly because a bunch of  ass-hats were overly pumped about a new 'hip eatery' (entrance is dependent on either a  handle-bar mustache or a 1\/4 sleeve tattoo).  Not the case; this place is le-jit. 

What did I eat? Biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits and mother-freaking, delicioso GRAVY.  Damn, it was fine.  Not the healthiest thing in the world, but my arteries can go fuck themselves.  Unfortunately, with my dish of choice being so filling, I was unable to perform my duties as 'daddy-disposal' - My child's unfinished portion of dutch pancakes, with fresh berries and what I'm assuming was homemade whipped cream was left for the hungry, more than likely neck tattoo'd kitchen staff.

As others have said the coffee is fantastic, actually the best I've ever had.  The espresso is always perfect.  I have a weakness for their iced mochas-- really the only iced mochas I've ever liked. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too anything... just pure awesomeness.  And their whipped cream?  It took me about a year of visiting Lux to discover this sweet surprise, but it is so good.  Still not sure what the special twist is, but it is goooooood. 

And their baked goods are better than any I've had at a coffee shop.  Most are made on-site in an adorable little kitchen in the hallway.  My love of baking tempts me to slip in, tie on an apron, and start baking- but I've held myself back from offering unsolicited help.  At least thus far.   

The staff is always friendly and always remembers your name (or at least makes a concerted effort to do so). It's generally crowded-- which makes sense, being as it is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee shop in Phoenix... maybe Arizona... maybe the US. Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat.   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor, ambiance, and clientele suggests this, but for some reason, it still feels comfortable and friendly.  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche.... whatever it is, it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.",2,0,2

The pros:
*Amazing coffee - my fav is the iced velvet.. It tastes like a piece of red velvet cake
*Their homemade whip cream! *drools*
*Their assortment of baked goods
*Their salads and lunch foods
*So many different places to sit inside and cozy up

Cons:
*Staff- this is where they lose points for me. I have only encountered maybe 2 friendly people who work here. there is one gal in particular who REALLY needs to freshen up on her customer service skills. I mean really... It's scary how unfriendly she is. 
*The fact that you basically have to beg them to put whip cream on your drink. I'm sure a lot of people don't even know they have whip cream. They keep it in this hidden container in their fridge and they skimp on it big time - depending on who is working
*If you're not hipster, you are going to stick out like a sore thumb. I usually come in my work out attire and people typically look at me like I have just sprouted an extra head. It's quite comical
*They stop serving breakfast at a certain time (I can never remember what time) but they keep the breakfast menu up all day and when you ask for something from the breakfast menu, one of the suuuuper friendly (sarcasm) baristas will bark at you that breakfast is over.. Which you are then forced to go back and look at the small food menu that is printed on a piece of paper and all of the hipsters who are in line get super annoyed at you. I'm sorry I'm not a regular who comes 5 times a week, I guess I don't know the protocol?!!


Anyways, I continue to come for 2 reasons.. The amazing coffee and the fact that it is middle meeting ground for my best friend and I.

This place has really tapped the arse of every possible stream of revenue. Coffee... fancy coffee... freshly squeezed juice, homemade pastries, sweet and savory, packaged cookies, breakfast lunch and dinner, cocktails

If you are lucky. Chocolate chip almond paleo cookies- but if you are GF, make sure to ask them to use a different spatula to avoid cross contamination!

My only gripe - (gosh even typing that word I sound grouchy!)... is that it seems they ALWAYS run out of gluten free baked goods EVERYDAY, VERY EARLY. AGHH! .... Seems like quite the missed opportunity for them. They do a great job at creating what they do, but golly, make MORE. If people ask you all day for these things, and you are always out at 10:00am. hmmm... 

Anyways. When out of GF fresh goodies, you will be directed to bagged peanut butter cookies. Blah. No thanks.

I've never been here when it wasn't super packed and bustling but have still always been able to find a quieter spot to study or get work done in one of the back rooms. They have a huge case of treats with a few vegan options and sell homemade granola and protein bars if you want something healthier\/gluten free. They also have a menu with brunchy type food which is really good and reasonably priced for the quality. 
For drinks, I usually just get a latte with almond milk since the coffee is so good here it doesn't even need syrup or flavoring but I also really love their dirty chai lattes (they make their own chai blend and it's super spicy with lots of cinnamon!).

I did not however, expect it to be packed at 9:30 at night, half an hour before closing.  I ordered a latte; it was smooth and rich.  I would have mistaken it for a breve (made with half and half instead of milk) but I watched the barista make it and I'm sure it was done correctly.

This place reminds me of an old western movie where a villainous cowboy would come crashing into a saloon and is quickly tackled by the good guy. Now, instead of the cowboy imagine this place packed with mac hackers. Yeah. 

Hackers in the middle of the dessert. That'd be an awesome movie. Okay, of course the people in Lux weren't hackers. But when you enter into the dimly lit coffee bar and everyone has their macs up... you wonder if you stepped into a warp hole.

All that aside, they have a good selection of coffees and teas. Hubby got a double shot espresso latte .... with a pretty leaf of latte art! Hubby thought it had a less sharp taste than the double shot we got in New York... but I thought it was just fine and dandy. Really enjoyed it. 

I also got a small vanilla cupcake w\/ espresso frosting. I liked the frosting...really tasted like whipped espresso but the cake was wanting. 

We settled into a sofa seat ...and I took a small nap while he surfed the net with their free wi-fi. There's seating outside with wooden chairs as well.

I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch. As I don't live in AZ, if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time, I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.

I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.

The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.

That's right. Tango lessons. 

A bunch of chairs and tables would be moved back to create an ideal milonga space. Depressed Mode would fade out  for the dramatic strains of Astor Piazzolla. And this random couple would appear out of nowhere and start dancing in the middle of the room while the other 4 people sitting around (me included) would continue working on their laptops or studying. This would go on for about an hour. Every Tuesday. 

That was circa 5 years ago, and I never saw anyone else ever get up to tango. Which is probably why it eventually stopped. A missed opportunity, in hindsight. I could have made major headway in Phoenix's numerous tango halls. Alas.

Today, Lux is even more bustling than it used to be (sometimes overly so). A full-on Apple army on every table and couch inside, while actual human interaction (aka talking to your friend) is mostly reserved for the outdoor tables. 

But long gone are the days of being treated by an oftenly complained about surly cooler-than-thou barista. Don't get me wrong. There are still cool baristas working there. But service has been consistently excellent and friendly for quite a while now to every customer that walks in. They also still make great coffee product (caffeinated soy lattes and decaffed Americanos are my usuals nowadays - and apart from one bad mishap years ago, the espresso is always done just right and the soy is never curdled or burnt).

Doing work or studying here - well, that more or less depends on you and whether you can shut out the loud music and continuous cacophony. For me, at times it gets to be too much and I eventually pack up and move to somewhere quieter, and yet other times it all just clicks and I plow right through my work despite all the noise. So take that for what you will.

But as for the music, regardless of the noise level, there's always great stuff on board. And sometimes the most random. Most recent example: a steady stream of Hot Chip tracks followed by ""Party All The Time"" by one Eddie Murphy. Sadly, I was the only one in the entire place old enough to recognize and truly appreciate this unexpected masterpiece. But it served its purpose.

As Lux continuously does, a longstanding gem of a coffeehouse in the expanses of the Arizona desert. 

It may no longer have a lone couple awkwardly dancing tango in its midst, but it does serve a pre-bust and pre-Pluto Nash Eddie Murphy crooning overhead for your listening pleasure.

It's the important things.",4,2,4

I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. 

Lux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a ""look"" of, ""hey, who are you?!"" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.

The new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the ""hipster"" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.

I will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the ""Number 47"" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, ""Well today it's just the 46."" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.

Oh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? 

Overall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the ""hipster mecca"" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth.",3,1,1

After looking up a few reviews, she decided to try Lux, a cafe I had visited a few times in the past. Excited to get out, I agreed to go and looked forward to breakfast, which did nothing more than disappoint me.

My fiancee and I parked the car on the street and walked into the building to find a disappointingly long line. As we got closer, it became apparent that only one register serviced the entire line. While some employees did come out to ask what drinks they could get started, we still felt the line could have been decreased had another register been added. I ordered orange juice and biscuits and gravy, and my fiancée ordered orange juice, a Danish pancake, and a side of bacon.

We ordered our food and searched for a place to sit. After another long wait, our order finally came up. The pancake and the biscuits and gravy presented themselves well on the counter; however, the bacon did not appear anywhere. Thus, I asked one of the cooks about the bacon, to which she answered coldly that the meal did not come with bacon. Considering this cook might have misunderstood me, I clarified that my fiancée had ordered a side of bacon. When given a second opportunity, most people generally take advantage to correct a mistake. Instead, this cook callously answered that no bacon was on the ticket and went back to work. 

At this point, I returned to my fiancee and asked her for the receipt, as I had perhaps misheard her order. She did not have it, so we both returned to the ridiculously long line and went directly to the cashier. The cashier commented that the computer system is horrible, did a few things on it, reprinted a receipt, and handed us some kind of card. Not having received an explanation, I asked what the card was, and she explained that it was a $15 gift card. She further explained that the side of bacon would be ready shortly. We finished out meal and discussed how disappointing the experience was.

I have decided never to return to Lux because this company does share the same values as I do. Most of the staff seemed very slow moving, despite a long line and long wait times for meals. In addition, the dis-service offered from the cook does not instill trust in me for the person making my food. The disorganization and rudeness of employees turns me off, and I would rather give my business to companies that offer friendly, prompt service, such as Starbucks or even Dunkin' Donuts. While you may be a local business, that alone does not entitle you to my business, especially when you offer sub-par service with a lack of systems and courteous staff. I would rather stay confined to my bed for another two weeks than subject myself to this poor excuse of service again. All in all, we had to wait in a long line, fight several times to get the food we had ordered and paid for, and be treated horribly all before noon on a Saturday.",8,1,0

I don't pretend to be an expert on coffeebars especially since I don't drink coffee, but after living up the street for this place for a few months and always seeing it packed when I'd drive by, I jumped at the chance to check it out when some friends were there earlier today.

I gotta be honest, this place was nuts.  I was confused upon arrival and had to look at my watch to check the time because I thought I'd just walked into a nightclub.  This place was PACKED.  I mean not a seat open at 5:00 on a Tuesday.  Music was blaring inside!  My boss called me from NYC and literally asked me if he was interrupting my bar time because it was so loud.

Anyways, loud (bad) music aside, I still had a good time.  The people watching was fantastic.  Such a wide variety.  I mean you had so many different angles covered.  You had your hipsters typing away on their laptops trying to look very important, the tortured artist at the table next to me feverishly writing in his journal, the section that I can only call the hairdresser's corner because all of their hair was immaculately coiffed and standing about 3 feet high, to my friends who were doing actual work at a table, sending out invoices believe it or not.

And then there was me, jaw gaping open the entire time, obnoxiously staring at everyone around me trying to get my bearings.

Since I did not eat or drink anything, I should probably point out that I will be returning to Lux for the people watching alone.  It was that good.  I'd imagine it would be mildly difficult for me to work here with the loud electronica music blaring in the background, but that's alright, I'm willing to sacrifice work for just a little while longer : )",2,0,1

yes this place has good coffee, but what a bunch of rude pompous asses. I am just saying I am az born and raised from a hardworking family and back round . When I come into an establishment the last thing I need is for some trust fund hipster know it all to twitch his (or her) handle bar mustache at me with an equally annoying hipster stank eye, when I order my (in their opinion ) shitty cup of coffee. Sorry if i did not hash tag an over price thrift store shirt on my twitter , or order my special decoder ring from some homeless want to be spoiled brat to get the latest cool memo from the wonderful lux asshole cafe . But here is just a few tips that might get you a few stars 

1. after you argue with me over an extra shot not being a good idea in your wonderful cup of coffee, dont include yourself in my conversation when I finally get to enjoy it .
Just to correct me on a subject in a condescending tone that I am actually quite knowledgable about due to heritage and experience .

2. dont give me shit looks and long sighs when I come to the counter .

3.dont correct my opinion of coffee I actually have taken barista courses so maybe you can dip into your hedge fund and go to a couple yourself before you blabber your opinions all over my good day.

4. dont smack your lips and tell the person behind you in a shit sniffing tone mocking my order. 

5. believe it or not before you found your dream job as a barista and wasted all your parents money on a art degree, remember I have worked my ass off to just enjoy one simple cup of coffee with an extra shot , in a fun decorated establishment with a shitty leaf scribble across the foam. So if you gave two shits about the extra dollars I would so eagerly throw into your tip jar, shut the fuck up smile and just say yes would you like anything else? and talk shit about me at the end of your shift like the rest of us.",13,12,2

The ambiance of the shop lends itself to a study and work atmosphere. In this same breadth, it simultaneously offers people the ability to converse with a group of friends. In my humble opinion, the musical selection is on point and it reminds me of being in Portland and Seattle. This in and of itself is lofty praise from a snobby coffee drinking individual from the Pacific Northwest. As a transplant to Phoenix I would not say that this shop is a breath of fresh air, but rather a ray of light in a city devoid of coffee shops that offer quality service and goods. Even on a lively weekend where customers are spilling in and out of establishment the coffee served is always fresh and smooth. However, it is my recommendation to go during the week, as the coffee is not always as warm as one might come to expect. This is of no fault of the barista staff as they do not have an iota of downtime between orders. It is also worth noting that customers have access to a patio and a delicious selection of sweet and savory pastries. Although I may long for the coffee shops of Portland I believe that Lux Central is deserving of lavish praise and regular visits --especially for those who appreciate the way a cup of coffee, latte, or mocha should taste.",1,0,0

I walked in competitor x, scanned my choices, and walked out.  

That's when I made a beeline for Lux.  Hands down, Lux has the best dessert selection around.  Not only is everything made from scratch at this locally owned business, but the quality is outstanding, and in most cases the portions are generous.    

Wanna know the best part?  Sometimes the desserts have those crusty edges, you know, like homemade! The chain coffee houses might see this as a flaw - but at Lux the imperfections make this coffee bar perfect.

Being new here from Seattle I know my standards are probably too high but the coffee shop is the 21st century pub. The idea that a cross section of community could be in one place is the value a coffee shop adds to community. That old, young, and all the other things that make humans different could come to one place is a pretty great and NOT new idea. I travel a lot, so my kids (15,13, 12) and I have a tradition that has become a pretty important time in their life and a great experience for us. Before I leave on a long business trip we go out late (on purpose) cause my kids think its cool to go out late, to a coffee shop, they usually get a hot chocolate or something and a get a drink, we laugh, drink our favorites, tell stories, I teach some valuable life lesson that they probably don't catch, we post some instagrams, then we go home, they sleep in and I'm gone providing for my family when they wake up.

I am not bothered that this ""coffee shop"" doesn't serve coffee after midnight. I don't care that its a little hard to find (it added to the adventure) or that it was a little confusing when we walked in where to go or who to talk to (felt like we entered somones private club). What spun me is how we were treated. Lets start with - there was someone who worked there folding napkins who I walked past 3 times and finally had to stop her from what she was doing to find out who to order from, she then gave me a dirty look like I was bothering her and when she saw my kids with me she looked at me like ""what the hell are you doing here?"" I knew this was true when I OVER HEARD HER TALKING TO A COWORKER ABOUT US, AND MY KIDS BEING THERE! 
Lux if you don't want kids there, hang a sign. And if your going to talk crap about your customers at least text and and take my money so I don't know it. And if you don't like your job, get a different one.

The only positive, and the reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is I finally got some help from the bartender who was pretty kind.

Terrible first impression.",1,1,1

Their ""old"" location was too cramped, so moving next door was part of their natural progression.  The new space has plenty more square footage, but the layout of the rooms is a bit of a maze.  It's unclear precisely where to stand to place\/wait for your order and there were cardboard boxes and other items all over the floor.  The decor has it's own unique charm with it's mismatched plates and furniture but the furniture pieces are placed so close to one another you practically need to jump over them.  That was a bit much.  What's Lux it trying to be?  Contemporary?  Retro?  It's hard to say.  Even the ""front door"" we walked in turned out to be a ""back"" door.  Why would they throw so much capital into the space without some semblance of clarity?

The food we ordered was OK.  I had a slice of quiche (pictured) which I believe had sun dried tomatoes, among other ingredients.  The counter person was friendly and offered to heat it for me.  My friend ordered two scrambled eggs, hash browns and two slices of bacon (pictured.)  We sat a a table in another room not knowing if a server would ever find us.  A server later brought the food over and left rather quickly; too soon for my friend to show the server the bacon which was just delivered was burned.  My friend gave me a look as if to say, ""How could the server NOT realize this is burned to a crisp?!?!""  So...my friend had to get up, return the bacon, wait for two more (precooked) slices to sit underneath the broiler a while and by the time she returned, both our breakfasts were cold.  I will say my friend was happy with her coffee and my iced latte was da bomb!

Lux may still be working out the kinks in their new locale.  Once they organize the boxes, furniture and service concerns, they'll be prepped for enlarging their clientele of repeat customers.  If I turn out to be one of them, the path to their small outdoor patio looks inviting and not at all confusing to find.  You may find me there sipping an iced latte and listening to New Order.",1,1,0

Lux is one of those places. I drove down Central countless times and never noticed it. Now, I can't stop pointing it out to others!

I LOVE the vibe there. As soon as you walk through the double doors, people are scattered throughout the numerous couches, chairs, stools, tables, and futons they have, each with their own story. You have to seat yourself after you order your own food, so if you want a sit down dinner with some peace and quiet, maybe this isn't the best place. I still go on date nights because I love the atmosphere and the energy. Sometimes it's so packed that you have to sit next to a perfect stranger, but that's never bothered me. Going to Lux means being open - be open and you'll get the most out of your experience.

The only grievance I have is that I wish they served breakfast longer because their menu is perfect! I swear by their biscuits and chorizo gravy, it is to DIE for. Their bacon is great by itself, too. Their black cherry Italian soda with cream my choice of drink, and their pastries change from day to day. I love being surprised with their choices each time I go. Place your dishes and cups in the plastic bin near the kitchen on the way out - clean your immediate area, place everything in that bin, and they'll take care of the rest. Again, some people hate that part of it, but I love it. I feel like I'm part of it all.

I had some tea and a breakfast pastry of some kind, which were both great.  I wanted to try so much more, but we were on a shooting schedule (thanks for the space, BTW) and didn't want to look like a hog on-camera.

So it may be tricky finding parking, but you can easily take the light rail here too.  And it's worth it when you get inside.  We were there on a Saturday very early when just a few regulars and the staff milled about.  But as it started to fill up, I could sense the community that develops because of the atmosphere.  It reminded me of the coffee houses in the Pacific Northwest; like Seattle, a place I've never been but where I hear coffee was invented in 1991 by Captain Kirby Starbuck (I jest).  

Anyway, it is both a place to sit alone and enjoy your breakfast\/coffee on a comfy couch with a good to mediocre book, and a place where you go to meet people and talk because you're forced to by the people hogging the nice seats.  Also, you can wear your Matisyahu t-shirt here and people will get it (they may groan, but they get it).

So go to Lux to make some friends, level up on your hipster points, or just hide out because it's probably better than the Starbucks closer to you where all the unfriendly snowbirds hang out.  Oh, and it appears they're open and night too, serving alcohol, which is a bonus.",0,0,0

Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing. 

While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.

Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from ""home"" type of thing.

Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app. 

The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!

Which will be the finest tasting beverage that has hit your lips since the last time you came here. It is the chick sitting next to you in ray bans, red lipstick, and a crop top talking about lesbians and farmers markets and vegan peanut butter brownies.

The staff is very friendly.

Super speed. I'd even have settled for being able to break things just by screaming. But alas, instead of super powers all I got where good looks and charm. It's not easy, but I try to live with it as best I can.

Yesterday something happened to me, though. Something extraordinary. Something that cannot be explained with science. Or logic. Or even algorithms (I tried.) I believe I may have stumbled upon the secret to my secret abilities.

Amanda B and I came to Pane Bianco after the Anti-Prop 102\/Prop 8 rally. I was hungering for equal rights and social justice, but in the meantime I had to settle for salad and bread.

While waiting for our food Amanda turned to me and said ""I'm going over to Lux. You want anything?""

And without thinking I said ""Sure. Surprise me.""

I swear to Cthulu the entire restaurant froze in place. The two girls at the counter, Amanda, even the guy in the make making my salad, everyone, for the briefest of moments, were trapped in stasis by my naivety. 

By the power of n00bity, I had stopped time. Fuck. How do I unstop it?

Thankfully Amanda, who over time has built an immunity to my occasional outburst of teh dumb, fixed the situation.

""Ummmm...there's a lot to choose from. Maybe you want to make it more specific?""

""Yeah, hahaha."" Oh. Great. The girl at the counter has unfrozen herself too, isn't that nice.

""Perhaps coffee...tea...""

""Tea. Iced. Something fruity."" I tried to laugh the whole incident off, but there was no denying it, we all felt it; I almost broke Pane Bianco with my stupid. 

Soz.

After uncomfortably waiting on the patio (my ""ironically mis-matching outfit"" didn't work out like I had planned and the other patrons let me know it), I went into Lux to find Amanda, where I felt the smallest tuggings of belonging. With an interior this tacky, my outfit (comic book t-shirt, rolled up jeans, long black stripped socks, layers of bracelets, pink  faux pearls and business jacket...yeah...) and I fit right in. 

If only I had a Mac and a web design project I kept putting off to look at xkcd. 

Amanda got me the peach iced tea which I enjoyed immensely. 

Peach is one of those fruits, like grapes and green apples, whose actual flavor has been all but lost after decades of synthesized flavors (I predict that in ten years, at this rate, I won't even know what a real grape tasted like). 

But Lux's peach tea tasted like real peach. I can't say if they actually used real peach or if they just used some sort of syrup, but whatever they used tasted delicious. 

I keep hearing about how awesome their cupcakes are, and in the future I will possibly order one, but first I have to avoid that kneejerk ""Ugh!"" reaction I give when anyone asks me if I want the ""vegan"" option, like that time I giggled and said ""Soy milk? No thanks. I just want regular milk for a regular person"" to the barrista at the Starbucks on my campus.

I will  admit I have an irrational fear of soy, but I am willing to do the right thing and give it a try.

In the meantime, I'm going to see if maybe I can develop a different super power. I mean, stopping the world in its tracks with dumb comments is nice and all, but it's not going to get me featured in any comic books.

I just realized this is a perfect excuse to get some rope and make some people tell the truth.

Given my readers, even I'm afraid of what I'd find out.",10,10,8

1. Oddly, not coffee. I really am not a coffee person which leads me to...

2. Tea. I like tea. Tea and me are friends and when the barrista\/o knows just as much about his teas as he does his coffees, then I am always impressed.

3. FREE wifi. I've been traveling a lot lately and I never really appreciated the beauty of free wifi til recently. You get ripped off at hotels, airports, etc, so when a place like this doesn't charge you to chill and enjoy your time here while surfing for midget porn, then I am very grateful.

4. Good people watching. Let's face it. I observe people for a living. I don't technically get paid for this, but I do it and so, I require a nice amount of characters to check out. Last night offered a dude wearing sunglasses...at night, along with two gay guys on a first date. Always VERY entertaining to watch someone else's awkward encounter unfold. ""So, where did you go to elementary school?"" ""I hate when coffee is too strong!"" ""yada yada yada."" (PS, they left to go for a ""walk"" so maybe it did go well)

5. A cool bathroom. I know this may seem odd, but I love cool bathrooms and loathe gross ones. There is no middle ground for me. Sadly, Lux falls into the latter and it was guuross! The attempt at art is...interesting though, and by interesting I mean, not so much, but hey, at least it distracts you from looking around at the wet floor and paper towel explosions and dirty counters.

So how does Lux weigh in on my 5 list. I think at a solid 3.5. Overall, the atmosphere was a tad sterile for my taste. I generally prefer really cozy couches and warm tones and cool lighting instead of white walls and somewhat fluorescent lighting. But the white tea was damn tasty, so I gotta give it up for that :)",3,4,5

The silly, trifling, pretentious goons aren't here anymore, or maybe they've stayed away. The servers are nicer and more helpful, and that's pretty important, too. I've worked at restaurants and bars for most of my adult life and I still do- being concerned about customers is important...even if that seems ""uncool.",1,0,0

Even if you are in your mid 40s and are experiencing some sort of a midlife crisis, I would ask your hip son or daughter to bring you here. 

The coffee is above average but the food and the drinks selection are the bomb.com! 

If you are in college or grad school it is a great place to study and do work and if you are a professional, it could be a cool place to take clients for coffee or a drink!

I admit it. The skinny jean wearing, mac using vibe used to irk me in ways that I thought only a mosquito could. I would drop in, get every drink to-go and get the heck out of there as quickly as possible. Loud music, fauxhawks, etc... 

SIGH. 

Oh Lux. You're new space is sublime. There is enough space where I can find a cozy corner, turn on my work laptop, drink coffee, have the 2 egg breakfast with tomato and veggie hash (I opt for the tomatoes instead of bacon. AND. I love bacon, so i think that's saying something about how stinkin' good those tomatoes are).... Where was I? Oh yes, have my work computer on... so Office Communicator is running... ;) ... and I can enjoy breakfast (which frequently turns into brunch) and read the paper, a magazine, a book, make travel plans, etc. 

LOVE it. 

Also for you futbol fans (that's soccer to you english speaking folks), they will happily play your Barcelona should-be champions, on the big screen in the back room- all you gotta do is ask. 

***Speakeasy bar area. The mixologist takes some serious time and consideration for each adult beverage I've ever had there or seen him make. Delicious bloody mary's, GREAT beer selection (New Beligum Cocoa Mole!), etc. etc. etc.

For those of you west coast out-of-town-ers, they're similar to Intelligentsia, Ritual, and Stumptown.

When it comes to selecting and serving coffee, they strongly believe in getting the basics right (roasting, grinding, extracting, brewing, etc.) before consuming their time with other details (bean purveying, cupping, etc.).

With that said, their whole bean selection is limited, which may disappoint those (including myself) interested in unique blends and single origin beans.

More fun games to play at Lux: 
1)count the Obama bumper stickers on the cars in the lot

It has a menu now!  The food keeps to the same standards as the pastries and beverages, which probably explains why there's almost always a line at the counter and rarely a 4-top available.

I probably would have never found this place by myself.  its in a little yellow brick building, and I didnt see any signage.  I pulled into the parking lot, parked the car and went inside.  The place was packed!  Its small, and it was wall to wall people. Some on computers, some just hanging out, others were sitting outside socializing amoungst themselves.  There was really no where to sit!  I guess thats a good sign!  :-)

Anyways, from what I could see, the place was nicely decorated.  Went to the counter and placed an order for a cafe ole, and the girl kind of looked at me funny.  I guess she didnt know what that was?  (its half coffee, half steamed milk, FYI.)  A girl behind her told me that they make it different here, or whateves.  ugh, so I ended up with a slightly different drink then I had anticipated.  Slightly dissapointing!

Anyways, I dont know that I will be back anytime soon.  Why? Because this place was to small, to crowded and I would have no place to sit and and enjoy myself.

There were a couple of picnic benches with groups of people laughing and studying, drinking iced coffees and smoking. The interior was really pleasant. The music was a little loud-but, hey Brazilian Girls? Fine with me. There were a couple of guys to the right of the place hanging out on couches with calculators doing some hard-core homework. At the tables to the left were Europeans shootin the shit and taking pictures, laughing it up. The counter was low and while the pastries looked bangin, they weren't labeled and under kind of frosted domes, so a little hard to figure out what they were. I prefer pastries in the morning, anyway, no big deal. Both of the staff there were friendly and made me a Soy Chai for 2.50 (no extra for the soy-YES) and it was a REAL soy chai-no mix! Delicious. Under the counter were shelves-some with business cards and flyers. Another set had tons of magazines to borrow and freebies. Another shelf had kids books and colouring supplies (awww). The place looked clean and people were pretty happy to be there. I settled in near the front window on a low seat with a Business Week, Surface, Vogue and a book I was working on. I looked around some more and while I liked the white motiff...the problem with white? It gets dirty. And yeah...it looked a little unkempt. It felt a bit like a rumpus room. Not the best feeling. But so shabby mod! The artwork was well-displayed and attractive to the all-white decor and all kinds of different people of different race, age, backgrounds came and went in the hour I was there. The bathroom was well kept and I noticed they had Meyers products for toilet bowl and hand cleaner-I thought that was pretty kick-ass.

I've attempted to come here twice before, but tables were packed out and I needed to cram for an exam, not chat with some random guy at my table about philosophy.  The third time, I had no studying to do and therefore got to experience some of the ""culture"" of the location.  That's how I learned that I've been trying to come to Lux for the wrong reason - you don't come here to study, you come here to look and be seen.  You might do some light studying while also achieving the before-stated goals, but it's not your primary reason for visiting Lux.  Lux feels more like a bar than a coffee shop, which might be explained by the fact that they seem to have a full-service alcohol bar as well as their caffeine menu.  Patrons will likely randomly strike up a conversation with you.  They may or may not be on ecstasy when they do.  This place is hipster-center, with baristas who are working frantically to keep up with the large and growing line, and with crowds of people taking up most available seating at peak hours while writing books on typewriters. 

That said, the coffee is good, and they look like they have a wide range of food options.  I had a chai and sampled a few other drinks.  The coffee was definitely was better than most coffee chains.

Sure, you can see the sign out by the road, but the sign announces three separate businesses and there is no discernible entrance. You have to park in the back lot and walk in from the rear. There is no sign above the door. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't known to look for it, and if I hadn't been brave enough to blindly walk into an unmarked business. You could park on the side, right where you pull in off of Central Avenue, but know that you must go in at the middle point where the two buildings meet, and it feels like a back-door entrance. You must be cool enough to know how to get in the place. (joking).

The menus are shit. Meaning, you really have to look around hard to find the menus--it's not like there is a big wall menu above the counter, which is how it SHOULD be. It makes it tough for people in line to decide what they want, because everyone is craning their necks around everyone else in line just to read the posted menu. It is TERRIBLE. So they should improve on that. However, that being said, the bakery items on display look fab, and to taste them is divine. I wound up grabbing a box of pastries and a coffee to go. Best scones EVER, and worth $3 a piece because they're big.

My Americano was not that good--it tasted like it was made from instant coffee. But at $3 it was big and it was hot and it was coffee. That was okay for me, but I probably will not order that there again. It looks like they have lots of much more interesting choices to choose from, and if I had more time I would have tried something other than my old stand-by.

The food menu exists...you have to use bifocals. But look for it because the lunch and breakfast entrees look WONDERFUL. The seating looks more conducive to coffee and cocktail drinking. There is a big long table inside that looks like you can eat a meal at it. It is community style dining. There are tables in back, and tables outside that look like you can eat comfortably there.

I have to point out that it is the most hipster\/pretentious place EVER but in a good way. If you feel uncomfortable being judged by the hipster group, don't go. It is a really cool place and I plan on taking my sister there. She'll love it. My kids would hate it, but they are teenagers and think they're  too cool to be seen there, if that makes any sense. I loved it but in a fishbowl kind of way. I am not that cool, but I liked looking. What will get me back there is THE FOOD!

I've been coming here for years, since before Pane Bianco expanded and Lux moved into the new space next door.  Don't know why it took me this long to write a review.

Great coffee drinks, coffee beans roasted in-house (contrary to Mister J.'s claim below - the roaster is to your right, in plain view, if you're standing in line).

I love the fact that other than a few standard items, the daily pastry\/quiche\/cookie selection is always changing and incredibly creative.  Please, please, PLEASE make the homemade banana & nutella pop tarts again!

Great breakfast - I highly recommend the egg sandwich with applewood smoked bacon and roasted tomatoes.

One Lux's lesser-known strengths is its cocktail bar.  Drop in for a drink at night and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.  They don't have a drink menu - you just tell them what you like and what you normally drink and one of their talented and creative bartenders will whip up something for you.  Every time I've ordered a drink it's been different than the last and equally impressive.

All that aside, the real hallmark of Lux is the staff.  Everybody is incredibly warm, genuine, friendly, and helpful.  Despite being constantly busy, if you visit this place regularly it won't be long before the staff greets you by name.

The only gripe I regularly hear about Lux is that it is constantly busy\/crowded.  This may seem self-evident to me, but it's usually a good sign when a restaurant is heavily patronized so regularly.

It looked promising.   There was a line, a long line,  which shows that Phoenix is desperate for a place like this.  They had a good selection of baked goods (quiche and pastries).  They have other items to order, but, according to the person taking our order, the menu changes and they did have one to look at.  She had to tell us what else there was to order.  This takes time and holds up the already long line.  If I was just stopping in and did not know to ask, I would not have ordered anything.  I ordered a mocha, the quiche and a scone.  They offered to heat up my quiche... mistake and I will get to that. 

The place to pay, pick up and fix up your coffee were in the same 5 or 6 foot square and with a line this long it got crowded quickly.  The other thing was that if you were not paying close attention you could miss you order.  They put the order out and call your name and that was it.  You then had to look over several drinks that look the same trying to sort out which is yours. 

My coffee came out quickly.  Then my scone a few minutes later... not sure why it took so long to get a baked good from a plate to the counter.  My quiche was warming and took much too long. I was with my wife's cousin and his made to order breakfast came out just as quick as my scone and the quiche was almost 10 minutes later, it was only luke warm.

The scone (lemon poppy seed) was a little bland.  The quiche was... well see above and was only so-so.  The coffee was fine, but nothing special.  They want you to bus your dishes, but don't label the place to put the dishes. 

They had a DJ for on a Friday morning was a bit much.  The music was also too loud for a morning coffee joint.  I should not have to tell a DJ to turn the music down at a coffee joint in the morning.  This was a place where people were working, reading and socializing... it is not a night club, even if it was jazz.

Another thing about the line... I actually saw several small groups leave after waiting too long.

The people who started Lux saw potential, but I don't think they know how to run a coffee shop.  Unfortunately this is the only true game in town and people are going to put up with this until someone opens the competition.",3,1,0

But the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though...

The cashier immediately sparked up a cute witty banter and suggested their house specialties.  We went with one vanilla latte (my standard) and a Black and White latte which mixes dark and white chocolate.  Both were really amazing.

Another cool aspect is their little in house bakery.  On your way down the hall to the restrooms, you can sneak a peak at where they smelt up their decadent baked goods.  It looks so fun!

DON'T RELY ON ANYTHING YOU ARE TOLD OR YOU WILL LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT NOTHING AT VASEO IS AS GOOD AS THEY CLAIM AND THEY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT IS IN WRITING!   I moved my family to Vaseo after taking the nice tour with a very friendly woman who told us about all kinds of amenities and activities that Vaseo had to offer. In our move,it was most important to us that we find a place with 24 hour pool and gym access because we work odd hours and we were also looking for a place that had a pool that was heated in the winter so we could exercise all year round as we had both of those things at our last apartment and they were on our had to have list. We were told that there were 4 pools at Vaseo and that one of the pools was heated year round so we were sold. Then, we tried to swim in the pool in October, it was bone numbing cold, my skin turned beat red, and my body movements slowed. I called to ask about the heat in the pool and they originally told me that they don't start to heat the heated pool until November. Went back in November and there was no change in temp and then I was told they only heat their pool to 70 degrees (actually about 60-65), which in no way can be considered a ""heated pool"" because a heated pool standard temp is 85 degrees None of the employees know where the temperature switch is and they have no thermometers in any of the pools. I don't think the heated pool even has a heater.They have several hot tubs at Vaseo but they only heat them to around 80 degrees when the standard hot tub temperature is usually 100-102 degrees, so there's usually a ton of unsupervised kids jumping in and out of the hot tubs because the hot tub is more like a warm bath. Oh ya, as it turns out, the pools all close at 10pm instead of being available 24 hours as we were told, and this is the only thing the security squad seems to enforce like Martial Law.Very disappointing since all the things we moved here for were promised and never delivered. One good thing about Vaseo is the Happy Hour that they host about 8 times a year and welcome everyone to come and eat and drink and meet their neighbors. Its usually free and its a pretty cool thing to do. It doesn't quite make up for all the problems they create and the poor management of the complex, but it is something.",0,0,0

I met bonnie here pre-Chez Nous HH (that turned into evening since I got off work late) because my coffee shop connoisseur friend was posting up there until I got off work down the street. I admit I am directionally challenged to degree that is not only embarrassing, but debilitating. If you feel for me, take heed - I drove past it not once but two times. Add to that the light rail construction (it is right on central) and my post-work brain just about exploded. Poor bonnie had to take three calls from me before going out to the street to wave me in like an airplane.

But, once safely in the parking lot, there were ample spaces and I was surprised to see that pane bianco was right next door! Then it all made sense - why that phoenix cool-baby marketing rep asked me a date here, why so many people that I would not imagine know about these kinds of things seem to love talking about lux. It's right next door to prob one of the busiest\/coolest places to pick up sandwiches for up-and-coming downtowners (uptowners?). 

Well, although bianco was long-closed, lux was happenin' at 7 at night. there was plenty of comfy seating (two couches, and easily 7 or 8 arm chairs) plus a long table seemingly designated for setting up laptops. The staff seemed friendly and nice, and I really liked that the shelves for placing flyers was inset into the counter where you order - still visible but not at all the messy eyesore they inevitably end up being.

Ok, now for my favorite part - the clipboards that hang on stings against the wall so that patrons can hang their own sketches, drawings, paintings - whatever. (miss bonnie herself added a RAD sketch of a sexy bunny-man, I suggest you check it out).

Instead, you have a wonderful warm beverage alternative to your glass bottled brew.  Lux serves iced beverages too, but let's face it: coffee is best served hot.  I sampled the ice mocha, per recommendation of a friend who's been frequenting the joint for some time.  Amazing!  I did feel a little crampy afterwards, but that could simply be because I don't usually drink dairy products.  The Rice Krispie treat was really tasty, but those are hard to screw up.  :)   The place was packed with some cool-looking people.  Everyone seems to keep to themselves as they work on their respective laptops.  In fact, some people even shared tables yet remained fixated on their own computers.

I had heard of it before, but had driven right past it not knowing it was there. It is kind of tucked away. It is a neat coffee shop\/bar. It was pretty crowded on a Friday night which I did not really expect. We ended up having to sit outside because inside was so packed. Also at one point it got so packed that strangers joined us at our table because there was no room anywhere else haha. However, it is packed for all the right reasons haha.
The baked goods looked so delicious. I was not hungry when I went, but I really want to come back and try something. This one person had like some kind of fancy looking pie cake thing. I also walked past a few people eating some sort of mac n cheese I think? Whatever it was, it looked amazing. The laid back atmosphere is great too, it was a nice place to hang out for a bit. people were playing board games and stuff near the entrance which looked like fun! There are like different sections too which I liked. A room that kind of looks like a theater, I thought that was an interesting touch for a bar\/ coffee shop. I just came for a drink and had a glass of malbec, which I really enjoyed. They served me a pretty large glad of wine too which was great for the price I thought! They have a pretty good wine selection which is awesome. It looked like they make good mixed drinks as well, I saw a bartender pounding and preparing rosemary for a drink. I would totally come back to try a drink like that the next time I come. The service was good too which is always a plus! 
I want to come earlier in the day and get a mocha or latte or something. This place was cool, I would like to spend more time here!

Lux is a breath of fresh air in a city cluttered with boring chain coffee joints. From the modern, eclectic aesthetics to the masterfully prepared drinks (including the yummy homemade, scoop-able whipped cream!) and the laid-back staff, Lux is always a treat. 

A life-long Phoenician, I've always had the ""stay away from strangers"" mentality. When I first went to Lux I was dismayed that even at a ""slow"" time I was forced to sit either on the same couch or at the same table as a stranger. Now I have assimilated to the environment that provides ample opportunity to easily strike up a conversation with fellow Lux-goers. Thank you Lux for melting this cold-stranger-averse exterior! 

The only reason I cannot give Lux 5 stars is the lack of outdoor comforts. The picnic-style tables stand in stark contrast to the comfortable seats and atmosphere found indoors. On a beautiful spring\/fall night (which I can only dream of at this time of year), I want to sit outdoors in comfortable seats, with a good cup of coffee and enjoy great conversation.

I have forsaken Starbucks coffee since moving to AZ.  For one thing, Mr. Schultz, you suck (for selling the Sonics and for making a Grande latte $4.50).

I have moved on.  I am now--not so secretly--in love with Lux.  I get a ""medium"", otherwise known as grande to you, for $2.75 AND......ANDDDDD.......and my barista free pours the vanilla syrup.  I mean, it also tastes orgasmic, the coffee, that is.  By the way, I think their pastries are homemade.  Either way, their pastries are a DELIGHT!!  I always get the mixed berry corn bread muffin ($2.75) to go with my latte.  

Sincerely, 
A serious coffee addict

On a more serious note, they have outside seating with misters when the weather is scorching hot.  Since it's fall, the weather's been a lot nicer and this is a great hang out spot. They have their own parking and accept all major credit cards.  Their baristas are friendly and remember your name. This is a great place to get coffee and breakfast. No, they are not a franchise so you may have to drive a ways if you don't live in central phx...but hey, this is what makes their coffee affordable, orgasmic and worthwhile.  You should try them...at least once.",3,2,1

Review
The owners of Lux seem to have found the perfect balance between local relaxed coffee shop and fun vibrant cocktail bar. Due to this duality Lux always seems to be a busy place, allowing guests to work on their laptops or chat with thief friends. Durning the morning they offer locally baked goods and a small breakfast\/brunch menu. Their coffee is well brewed, roasted on site, and seems to be the coffee of choice for many restaurants in the Central Corridor area. In the evening the bar area comes to life and offers a wide variety of delicious cocktails served in original old school glassware. In addition to the cocktails the bar also offers an interesting selection of craft beers by the bottle or can.",0,0,0

First off, the line was REALLY long, which is both good and bad. Bad, for obvious reasons, but good because it tells you that they are popular, which would usually hint at the quality of the food you will eventually consume. 

Second, they are kind enough to get drink orders while you wait in line so that you can start having your coffee, tea, juice, or whatnot, while you wait for your food. Third, the decor of Lux was cool enough to distract me while my friends and I waited for our breakfast to be prepared. Lots of retro-looking lamps on the tables combined with art from local artists made for a warm and welcoming atmosphere. 

When our food did arrive, we were all satisfied! I got the Aunt Gladys's homemade salsa over four strips of tender belly bacon, three scrambled eggs, white cheddar, and hash, which was pretty delicious. My two friends also really enjoyed their meals. I'm giving them 4 stars because I did think that their food was a bit over-priced for what you got, both in portion size and quality. I mean, it was $5 for a glass of orange juice... Other than that, I was very satisfied with the experience.",0,0,0

Coffee and tea: good, like most specialty places that serve it (Cartel, Echo, Urban Beans, JoBot, etc etc etc). But let's talk about the REALITIES of a trip to (not)Lux.

There are many parking spaces that are usually taken. My guess is more than 70% of the crowd here are students who spend all day working over a cup of coffee and maybe a sssscccccooooonnnneeee. The ""Order Here"" counter is placed right along the entrance, so when lines back up, they are backing up into a seating area. God help you if that mommy with her two toddlers are seated at an entrance-area table. Good luck getting past that, boss.

The employees here are beyond obnoxious. Gave 'em multiple chances to be cool. They ain't. The baked goods are all pretty much blah\/dry\/not good. On our first visit to (not)Lux, we sampled much of the pastry menu to-go, because we had heard good things. But much like Cartel, Lux is all hype and not comfort, goodness or fun. It's pain. Pain to find parking. Pain to wait in the interminable line. Pain to deal with the 24-year-old baristas and register jockeys. Pain to find a place to sit. AAARRRGGGHHH!!!

If you're young and down to study and stare, this place is for you. If you aren't 18-25 and wearing flannel, jean shorts, Converse All-Stars, hipster glasses (prescription or otherwise), really wanna live in Portland, have iPod earbuds soldered into your head.............move along, because there's nothing to see here.",13,17,6

It made Starbucks look like 7\/11.  I also had a peach upside down muffin which resembled a piece of pineapple upside down cake.  It was also really really delicious.  

I love the mix of modern, antique, and industrial.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a lot of seating available. The ladies room was clean.  There were some dirty dishes scattered around the place, but it was busy and I didn't really care- they were all picked up by the time we left.  There were a few hipsters in there, but my conservative suburbanite parents felt very comfortable in there as well.  

My only qualm was the lack of a menu and pricing.  If my friend hadn't recommended the Velvet I would've been totally clueless, and possibly disappointed.  While I was waiting in line I even pulled out my phone to check if their website had a menu, but couldn't find anything.  In the restaurant I could only find a list of teas (on a small piece of paper right by the register), and alcoholic beverages (on the glass wall).  Maybe I just wasn't looking in the right spot.

Dutch Pancake with House-whipped Cream and Berries

Recommended by a well-traveled Las Vegas Chef, the hip vibe and Coffee program cited in addition to a substantial number of house-baked goods, it was just past nine on a rainy New Year's Day that three visitors settled into a couch of pink leather at Lux Central, the house already more than 3\/4 full with a growing line as a middle-age DJ spun shoegaze intermixed with other mid-tempo tunes.

Generally open 6am to Midnight, the late night leading to 2017 allowing staff to sleep in a bit, those arriving at 4400 North Central Avenue on 01\/01\/17 consisted of all ages and genders with a lean towards Millennials, a hirsuit young Barista taking orders from the line and passing them on to a colleague in order to expedite traffic while a team of clerks gathered pastries and generated tickets for orders requiring preparation from a postage stamp-size kitchen in the back.

Focusing mostly on Quick Breads and American classics, glamour-shots of David Bowie and Chewbacca contributing to the décor, it was after slow perusal approaching the counter that a sizable order was formulated, a total of six pastries presented on five plates with twenty-minutes quoted as the wait time for a $9 Dutch Pancake.

Not in any rush, the leisurely morning a welcome change of pace from days prior, it was with self-gathered silverware that a tasting got underway, first bites of the Strawberry Scone trending sweeter and softer than the British staple while the Raspberry Muffin was minimally different in texture, the small chunks of White Chocolate simply replacing pockets of melted Butter in the former.

Smiling at the $1 Friand with a cursive ""L,"" essentially a Hostess Cupcake made dense with better Cocoa, Lux Central's Coffee Cake as well as the Banana Bread do an admirable job of negating Phoenix's dry-air by dialing up the wet ingredients, the Blueberry Corn Muffin also showing well with what seems to be a 1\/3 each ratio of Butter, Berries and Cornmeal. 

A bit compromised by crowding, a lack of table service requiring diners to be attentive to their name being called out from a kitchen nearly 30-yards away from the door, it was precisely nineteen minutes after ordering that the high-walled Pancake was collected, a crisp rim surrounding no less than four types of fresh Fruit plus a sizeable dollop of hand-whipped Cream that made any thoughts of Syrup unnecessary.",7,1,8

I came by and nearly left because the posted address goes to an office and the entrance around back appeared to be for another restaurant. Eventually we found our way, but it's a douche move to intentionally limit your patronage to those ""in the know"".

But goddamn if the coffee and desserts aren't the best I came across in the greater Phoenix area. The Lux salted cookie sandwich and a cappuccino made an incredible dessert that had me eating my words about this place being a bunch of pretentious, artsy bullshit. I mean, it is, but I guess if you have the skills to back it up, you can get away with it. The barista who helped me was friendly enough, but some sort of organization to the ordering system should be appreciated, as it was mostly a herd of people standing in front of the registers until they were summoned by staff. 

Great late-night stop to catch up with friends over drinks or sweet treats. Snag a copy of their cute-ass menu with vintage drawings and old-school dining specials. Outdoor seating available, since indoors is limited and smoke-free. Were their holiday hours not limited, we would have made the 10 mile trek out of our way to visit again before leaving town.

Yesterday, after leaving Lux I realized I had lost my set of keys. I decided to call Lux to see if I had left them behind. Elena answered the phone and I told her my situation. Not only was she kind, she also went around Lux while on the phone with me to search for my keys. She even went to the parking lot and tried to find them there. I was pleasantly surprised with her thoughtfulness to search for my keys for me. Though she wasn't able to find them while I was on the phone with her-she assured me that she would call me back if anything came up. She also proceeded to tell me to have a good day and good luck finding my keys.  So thank you Elena, for restoring my faith in humanity and for being such a kind individual.

So it seems that when naming this grand coffee shop, the owners knew what they were doing. Now in order to have a successful and popular coffee shop, many aspects come into play. First and foremost, the coffee must be outstanding... you could have all the other important parts such as great ambiance, food, space, parking or free wifi... but if your coffee is no good, the people will go elsewhere.

This place happens to have it all! from the moment you either park on the street or on the lot, you know you're headed to the gem of the neighborhood. There are ALWAYS people here... that is the first sign of feeling the reassurance of going to the right place. as you walk through the entrance, the aroma of the ground coffee beans just invades your senses and your body just feels that ""I am at home"" comfort level.

The set up in this place is pretty sweet. Spread all throughout this coffee house are seperated rooms full of varried couches, benches, sofas, chairs, tables and work areas. This place is suited for everyone from the student to the professional and from the reader to the social butterfly. In one of the rooms, there is even a tv which they play sports on for the hipster fan :)

Straight back from where you walk in, there is the barristas' counter joined by the small exposition kitchen. They have fresh pastries available as well as fresh fruit, eggs, etc. They seem to have a bit of something light or heavy for everyone. As for the most important part of this venue, the coffee, they seemed to have come close to perfection with their blend of beans. Whether you order it black, mocha'ed, latte'ed, iced or hot... the flavor is never disappointing. What is also nice, are the variety of mixers for your coffee. They have soy, almond milk, low fat, skim, whole, etc. You name the drink and they shall make it. A traditional espresso drink has two shots but if you need that extra boost, they will happily upgrade you to the quad.

Now, in addition to the cafe part of this place there is a bar nestled in the back corner facing the entrance. If you are just not feeling the mood of coffee just the coffee house, one can order wine, boutique beer or even a refreshing cocktail. Not many modern day coffee shops have this additional amenity. It's nice to have the option when you are in a bit more relaxed and or social mood. The bartenders seem to have enough knowledge to concoct most drinks the average person can come up with, so don't hold back!

All in all, this place is doing it right. It all started with an idea that sprouted into this diamond in the desert. My only criticism is that this place is becomming SO popular, that it is almost losing that comfortable casual feel because of the crowd. My suggestion... open another location!!!!! :)",0,0,2

... But that's exactly why I love Lux so much. It's very communal, chill and friendly which makes it a great place to meet cool people. When I first moved here three years ago, I didn't know a soul. So I used to go sit at Lux with my laptop every night. Despite being super shy, I'd always get chatted up by at least one person (many were cute dudes trying to hit on me, but also lots of lovely platonic friend-types, too). You won't find a more diverse mix of interesting people on a weeknight. 

My Lux ritual helped me make friends, learn about PHX & break out of my shell. 

Also: the lattes and baked goods are bomb diggity awesome. And though you wouldn't necessarily expect to get great eats at a coffee house, dinner is AMAZING too. 

Thank you Lux for feeding me, entertaining me & helping me get hitched. XOXO",3,0,6

They had an incredible baked goods selection (the apple tart was delicious), a full menu of interesting foods, a mixologist on staff, and even a live DJ. That's right, a DJ, and I went on a friday afternoon. 

I went for lunch so I got the dutch pancake with potatoes, broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, topped with cheese. It was one of the most unique meals I've ever had but also one of the best lunches I've ever had. 

There was a good amount of seating, both outside and inside. Was the place hipster? Of course. Everyone had been mentioning that in their reviews.

Parking can be hard sometimes because this place is so good.

I had an order of hot chocolate and it was creamy and delicious. The barista drew a beautiful leaf design in the cream on top; if they day is slow, they'll take their time to show off their talents with detailed art that makes me not even want to drink it because I'll ruin it. I love details like that. 

Their mac 'n cheese dish is made and baked perfectly and everything is served in big coffee cups that make you feel at home.

For anyone returning after a long time, you'll noticed they  moved into the cooler, larger building next door and gave their old area to Pane Bianco. The current building has an open sitting area but there are also 2 other rooms if you need it, but sometimes it's occupied so plan ahead.

Menu isn't the biggest I've seen but there is still a lot to choose from. They keep fresh food and a full staff on hand at all times so they can handle whatever is needed. You may think the staff comes across as ""too cool for school"" at first glance, but when you talk to them they come across as familiar, approachable and attentive.

Their famous coffee and other drinks are priced how you'd expect. When they were in the old building, I fell in love with the pastries. I was delighted to find that they had expanded on the amount of pastries available. The first thing I bought was a lemon cookie. Then I came back twice for those cinnamon rolls TWICE. I had to come back because they almost always sell out. The good news is, they sometimes make them twice a day. If you have something specific in mind(only if you are specific), just call ahead to see if your favorite item is up or not.

They have a full menu now, which is nice when you want to bring your laptop to do business and then stay for lunch. The meals and are a little expensive but I had a beautiful BLT with the most epic macaroni, which made both worth the price. I enjoyed it so much, I came back the next week with family and we ate breakfast with that same tender belly bacon kissed with a delicious char that was in my BLT.

Yea, everyone knows the atmosphere is trendy, but there are other points to bring out. The buy fresh flowers from the nursery next door sometimes, they keep local art on the wall, and the outdoor seating is great if you bring your well-behaved pet. Interestingly,just like a good Trader Joe's store, they have their own resident artist who keeps things hip and fresh. I would love a gig like that!

Last, I don't know why I like this, but I am in love with their eclectic interior design. Mid-century-modern furniture in an industrial style building with a rustic exterior. They even have industrial-style bathrooms. Someone pointed out to me the bathrooms usually have Charmin toilet paper, which may not matter, but it's the little things that count sometimes.",0,0,0

The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular.

I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office.

I hosted a documentary screening here in the projection room to a large crowed & even had it open to all patrons in the house that night.

It has been on my bucket list of coffee shops to visit and I finally got around to it when my husband and I stopped by twice in the past month. The parking situation is a mess, but all parking downtown is cramped so I can't fault them for that. The outside is rather inconspicuous and has a small but decent sized patio. The inside is a little deceiving on space as there are two sides of the place. If the front is super crowded, swing around to the other side where there is more space. The line sometimes goes out the door but it is worth the wait. 

The first visit, we both ordered iced vanilla lattes. We sat at one of the communal tables and enjoyed our delicious drinks. It was fascinating to simply people watch and see the delicious looking food the kitchen was pumping out.  Everything looked so good, we decided we had to come back for breakfast. Thus, a few weeks later, we came back for the second time. This time we both ordered hot vanilla lattes and two orders of the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. DELICIOUS! The biscuits were fluffy and carried the gravy perfectly. The gravy was the perfect thickness, both flavorful and peppery. The two eggs were cooked over easy (as ordered) and the side of bacon was just so good! It was thick, cooked perfectly crisp, and so flavorful. It was a little spicy\/peppery, but I loved it. 

Overall, we had a great breakfast and the coffee is fantastic. I would highly recommend Lux and will definitely be back.",6,0,2

My friendship with Lux has seen me through three past relationships and a current relationship, which is astounding. I would marry Lux, but my life, my lover, my lady, is the the sea (ha ha, I got jokes). I've been going to Lux forever. Sometimes sporadically, but for the past year every Saturday except when I'm out of town, and when I'm out of town and it's Saturday, I miss this g*d*mn place. I went to a sushi place a month or so back and the server there recognized me from when she worked at Lux years ago. 

People mention the too-hip crowd, but I have to let you know that they're the kind of too-hip kids that used to be fat in high school. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here except the little kids who make faces at me or offer me their stuffed animals while I'm in line, those d*mn kids (jokes, again). There was, of course, one time this guy tried to take my place and mark it with his apple computer before I even got up from my seat, but I scolded him like a puppy (a strong ""NO!"") and told him he could have the seat when I decide to leave. You might think, ""well, if you don't recognize the too-hip kids, then you, too, must be a too-hip bastard,"" but let me tell you, I'm 31-going-on-65. My goal in life is to become a golden girl, I am currently really excited that there might be a concert band I can join, and my blood pressure goes over the top when I throw rocks into the ocean. Hip, I am not.

Mad props to the owner and his boisterous voice, Shadi (I don't know how to spell her name but she's there most Saturday mornings), the newish counter lady with the short red hair on Saturdays, the many rotating coffeemaking dudes, and the dude who sits in the corner on Sunday by the roaster room and plays music from a laptop over the speakers. There's also a coffeemaking dude at night whose name I don't know, but he's hilarious. You know it's been a rough day when I'm rolling in at 9:45 pm to get some caffeine, and this dude always makes me laugh. He's one of the too-hip people there with thick rimmed plastic frames.

I just realized I posted a review without reviewing the product. OY! The espresso is great. I've never experienced the drip coffee, but I've gotten various espresso drinks from cappuccinos to dolled-up espresso mochas. They're consistently fantastic. I can think of two occasions I didn't like the espresso, and they were both drinks in which I decided to go with soy milk. Every so often, I pull a hippy move and decide to try soy in coffee. It's horrible no matter where you go, so I don't hold it against Lux.",2,3,1

Lux is like the community center for the hipsters and thirsties. I don't know if I""m hip, but I do know sometimes I get thirsty. For some java. And thirsty for a non Starbucks place to hang. I think the loud DJ music kicks ass. What a great stamp to put on the ever so tiring hip coffee house scene still sprouting up across this great land. Funky art? Seen it. Eclectic rec room furniture. Sat on it. Tattooed and face- bejeweled employees? A must have. But the DJ? That's all Lux baby. My doctor has ""suggested"" (ok, like he totally insists) that a go easy on the caffeine.

I come here so much for a good couple hours to study to abuse the real value of the Hibiscus iced tea with unlimited refills and munch on some home-made pastries, cookies, or whatever they make. I like to think that their food is home-made food, but with the slight disadvantage of missing the comfort of your PJ's. I wish I knew about this place before when I went to a certain girls college prep near here...

Here's some hacks:

It can get crowded, especially on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch. Come super super early (the ARE open a at 6, but 8 is a good time) for fresh-baked goodness. You can also come later, from 5:30 onwards night to avoid crowds and delicious options for dinner. 

Lux is open till 2AM on Friday and Saturday, and on every other day of the week, it is open till 12. (The bar is only open from midnight to 2 however, not the main stuff.)

You can ask for a dollop of Nutella with their fresh baked croissants. Perfect little breakfast. Also, their whipped cream is unique, dense, rich and amazing.

I sometimes get a white hot chocolate, usually during the 'colder' months. It isn't on the menu, but you can ask for it. It's a delectable sweet treat, with perfect foam. :) 

Their hot teas really aren't that good, but their iced teas are great. You can get refills for their simple coffees, tea and their iced teas. It's probably a sin that I haven't been as interested in their coffee, since coffee gives me tummy aches. Alas. 

HOWEVER, PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEIR FOOD IS GOOD!! Their food changes daily, so my rule of thumb is, if you see it and think you'll like it, get it, because you might not see it again for a while. Their delicate honey lavender shortbread haunts my sweet dreams...

for that reason, it's not really a good place to have a work meeting, for example - the tables and couches are almost always occupied enough that you can't gather more than two or three people without being separated.

this changes when the weather isn't blistering - they have a great patio with more group seating.",1,1,0

Unfortunately, the last time I was there with my father I was very disappointed. My father has been coming here for a few years here and there. I, myself, had been there almost twice a week since I moved to the downtown area in January. My father and I had been there twice previously together and had a wonderful time, although this time was different. My father is a deputy sheriff in a different county and was in town briefly for a class he was taking to become a better peace officer, he just happened to come straight from class and had his county polo on as well as his firearm holstered. The whole cafe, including the staff gave dirty looks and multiple rude comments were made, one, as we were leaving being ""Oh, is she under arrest."" Completely opposite from the other million times I had been previously, Not one person greeted us positively or flashed a smile back. I have never before in my life felt so sad and disrespected AND I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE EVEN FELT SO. My father never once said anything or engaged. Sad to say I will not be going back to this establishment",0,1,0

I seem to be the last person in Phoenix to have wandered in here to try coffee and a bite though!  I can't get enough of the feel inside Lux with it's mix of decor (straight down to their plates and cups).  

I ordered their biscuits and chorizo gravy and all I have to say is...all gravy poured on top of biscuits should be made with chorizo!  The extra flavor and slight kick to it made this way better than I've ever tasted elsewhere.  I recently had biscuits and gravy in Portland (at a very delicious breakfast spot) and it didn't compare at all!  Sigh.

I did have a mocha and didn't quite prefer it at all.  It had that super burnt coffee taste to it, even with some honey and sweetener.  Blech!  My friends have reassured me it doesn't usually taste like this...however, I think it's honestly not my style of coffee.",1,0,0

You see, sometimes I go in and ask for a soda from the fridge in the back.  They usually pretentiously tell me to get it myself, as if I'm the only person who forgot to read the LUX Etiquette Handbook, Vol,4.  Im ok with getting it myself, thats all good.  But then the next time I go, i try to get it myself and an employee cuts me off as i attempt to open the fridge and says:

 ""Uhhh, can I help you?""  

I say, ""well, last time they told me to get the soda myself?""   

She says, ""Only when we're busy""


Yet it was more busy then than the previous time. 

So to all the lux regulars, how many people is considered busy, or is there some other way in determining this.

Also, i always ask for whipped cream.  Half the time they put it on, half the time they don't.  Thats too bad because the whipped cream is amazing.

Last note, the arrogance, pretentiousness, self-obsessed, elitist vibe is uncanny.  Not the physical place, but the people.  If you don't walk in with a with that certain ""I know good coffee and I'm special""  attitude, they stare at you like an alien.  Oh, and you have to have a mac laptop too.

But i will still continue to go here because they have the best coffee.

Oh well.",3,3,3

Secondly, I wanted some morning coffee on a Monday morning while visiting Phoenix.

If I were limited to rail travels, I'd tout its easy accessibility it is to the rail, but I had a car, and it's in a convenient location that at worst, requires a U-turn to get to.  Parking was a little sparse, but I was able to get a spot, probably because I was hitting it up after the real main morning rush.

The interior of the place was unique, and sub-sectioned to about three or four different mini-lobbies of some sort.  It's cozy and inviting in most of them, but you better like your fellow man if the picnic benches are the last place to sit.

I went for just coffee, so I didn't experience the food, although lots of people attest to it being really good.  As far as coffee was concerned, out of the five, I guess local coffee joints I hit up in Phoenix, Lux probably had the best coffee of them all.  The staff were all friendly and pleasant peoples, and they mowed through the lines of people efficiently and with smiles on their face.  It's a truly good atmosphere there, and despite the pretty hipster crowd, the air of smug arrogance isn't as prevalent from those who lounge there.

Phoenix as a whole has a lot of great food joints and coffee shops.  Lux easily ranks up there with them, and I'd visit again if\/when my travels bring me back out to Arizona.",1,0,0

Pros: 
-The bakery items- The fresh croissants, cookies, pies and all sorts of tasty morsels are always made form scratch and will satisfy any sweet tooth craving.
-The food- at 5:30 every night the dinner menu goes up. There are always a few staples like the mac and cheese, and also new and local daily creations that are every bit as delicious. I have never had a meal here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. 
-The bar- Prices are average, but they do know how to make some damn good drinks. Also they have a decent wine selection.
-Coffee and tea- they hand roast all their beans in house. Coffee and espresso are yummy and strong. They have large cups for drinks and have a great selection of hot teas. I'd recommend the toasty almond one.  

Cons:
-The space- I love the cool hodgepodge\/industrial look about the place but a coffee bar, restaurant, and bar all together makes the place seemed a little cramped with storage in all the halls and nooks. Trying to scoot by people without hitting them with your bag is normal. 
-The crowds- Avoid coming on the weekends or at dinner time if you are not by yourself. There WILL be HUGE lines and no seats for groups. I have stopped bringing people here for brunch, its just not worth it. Thats how crowded it can get. This is not as big of a problem is you are just coming alone, there will always be a single seat somewhere. 
-The seating- there is so much furniture in this place as they try to accommodate more patrons. The bar seats are shoulder to shoulder. And you could be sitting on anything from a super low looks like its from the 50's couch, to a upright plastic reading chair, or a picnic table bench. And all of the furniture is becoming dilapidated from all of the traffic: torn, stained, sagging. Its not that appealing. Outlets are scarce. 

Overall I still love the food and drink, and that keeps me coming after work, but I avoid the high traffic times. I like their late hours but find it more crowded. I would still definitely recommend checking the place out, on your own, on a weekday, around happy hour, and you should have no problem finding a seat\/outlet, and enjoying some food and beverages.",0,0,1

2. If you eat bacon like I occasionally do, bear in mind it's really fatty at Lux. I'm not into that sort of thing, because I prefer a bacon bits texture, only hot. So I have to ask for them to make it extra crispy. When they comply, it works, but I do still visualize clogging arteries. I consider what cholesterol looks like, and fatty liver disease in non-alcoholics, and all the other things I research on the internet because I consume information even more voraciously than food. I also think about how pigs are as intelligent as dogs so then I engage in some mental self-flaggelation and ultimately proceed anyway and just promise I won't do this very often and that I'm going to go vegetarian for another 5 years to fix things.

3. There's a scene in Lena Dunham's Tiny Furniture movie where her crummy old high school friend, the one with the British accent played by Jemima Kirk, whose character is a questionable ex-heroin addict who's so self centered and unhelpful that she's seemingly bent on keeping Lena Dunham down is trashed in her mom's house in the bathroom with her while Lena Dunham's little sister is having a totally-not-allowed party in their NY flat while their mom is out of town. While Lena Dunham's character is totally worried about what to do regarding the high school kids party going on in the house, her British friend is like, ""Yeah, they're really being bad. Do you want something to eat? Listen, I want something to eat. Let's go into the kitchen. Let's scrum into the kitchen and get a crust of bread or cheese.""

When I heard that line, I thought it was so odd and it really stuck with me. I mean, why would anyone have a craving for a CRUST of bread?

Then I went and ordered the baked eggs at Lux and it came with sliced thick pieces of french bread on the side with huge crunchy crusts that are totally amazeballs, and especially so when you're basically done with the baked eggs, but see that there's actually still some baked eggs left, stuck to the sides of the big mug that they bake them in, and so you use the crust of bread to clean out the inside of the mug, which is so much more effective a utensil than a pathetic fork, plus it's an edible utensil, and then you learn how completely right on that British ex-heroin addict friend of Lena Dunham's was.

Even friends who are mostly totally wrong are totally right about some things.",2,2,1

The people at lux take coffee very seriously, almost to a science, looking at the applied,focused and meticulous moves of the barista. The result is an amazing espresso, thick and oily, an explosion of coffee flavors and zero bitterness....

For those who enjoy, lux looks and feel almost like a 1960's hippie communal cantina except that most the patrons there are deeply absorbed in gazing at their laptops and ipads, facebooking and interacting in cyberspace, certainly not talking to one another. You will find here a hipster ambience, very stylish, very friendly and quite comfortable, as well.

On my last visit there 2 days ago, I was greeted by a charming barrista, but cashed in by a very abrupt, borderline rude young plump woman.... This killed the whole experience for me....

However, I will submit, the framed photography peppered around the establishment did make me swoon. And, the almond milk latte I had was supremely delicious. I went back the next day to get another latte and buy a bag of their coffee beans, and although I haven't brewed it yet, the coffee smells excellent. I actually think I'm going to preemptively buy a second bag to bring back to Boston with me. Both times I went the service was very friendly and fast.

When I worked in Central Phoenix, Lux was my daily coffee place on the days I got my ass out of bed early enough to stop before work after driving down from the far Northwest Valley. I'd stand in line like a zombie, roll my eyes at all the try-hard hipster clientele crammed into Lux's old space and pray that my coffee would take less than 15 minutes to come out. It was a means to an end.

Then, I got a promotion that put me at work closer to home, in the suburban wasteland known as the West Valley, where the only options for a morning java are the Circle-K on the corner or one of the 50 Starbucks locations within a mile radius. (I'm a VIP gold card holder now. Yay for me. *blows kazoo*)

But occasionally, I do get downtown. A friend might want to meet up for dinner at Windsor or I might need to turn in some paperwork down at the state department, and every single time I'm near, I find myself drawn up Central Avenue toward my old morning haunt.

Now, when I go to Lux, I welcome the cool reception from the baristas. I relish in the fact that the people who come here know what they want and how to order it properly. I enjoy the moment I get to take my hot latte and my carefully bagged pastry and find a dilapidated couch to perch on, where I can listen fondly to the nearby hipsters talking about art, music and other pretentious things, because it's so SO much more interesting than listening to a gaggle of PTA moms discuss ""super cute"" Pinterest DIY projects to make with their children Braden, Jaydyn and Vadinn.

And let's face it, Lux does make the best latte in town. The temperature and the ratio of milk to syrup to espresso is always perfect and it always comes out with a lovely bit of art on top, even when the line is backed up out the door. The pastries taste fresh, because they are made with real ingredients and served fresh, not made in a factory and shipped frozen across the country to be defrosted the night before they are served. 

Joke about the hipsters and the ""Great Aunt Susan's rent-controlled apartment in Bushwick"" look all you want, Lux is popular for a reason and they don't ride on image alone. The quality is in the food and drinks and they remain far ahead of the competition. You will never be bored here, I can promise you that.",0,1,0

""I don't know. It's peanut butter something.""

Okaaaay, we get it. Y'all are loved by all and so indie and hipster, it hurts. Lux has 1,500+ reviews with a high rating but I'm keepin' it real: You guys need to take it down a notch with the attitude.

Oh, you guys are artsy? Well I graduated from the Art Institute. You don't see me being all pretentious. You guys are being extra and without the delightful service.  

They made my hot chocolate with regular milk instead of almond and instead of apologizing and making it right away (come on... it's heated milk and pumps of Ghirardelli chocolate syrup here. You're not exactly melting chocolate bars!), you give it to my friend and made me wait while you prepared other people's drinks that were ordered after me. 

The hot cocoa was some standard Ghirardelli goodness and my peanut cake was pretty good. Sadly my gal pals' cupcakes were as dry as the air. 

So whatever. Scorn me all you want, Yelpers. I'll only be back in if I'm in the neighborhood. I do appreciate the late hours of operation.",54,50,56

Since the big remodel, it is even better than before!  They do serve alcohol and their menu looks pretty delicious.

So many coffee shops, so little time!  Finally made it to Lux and I was not disappointed!  I wasn't there to connect to wi-fi but if I had been well this is the place to go.  However I was there to meet a large group of people (enter shameless plug for said group here...Indie Music Meetup group) and I must say the outdoor seating was great.  Big picnic tables and benches ample enough to squeeze in all 12 of us.  Granted it is hot and humid this time of year and sure that wasn't great but that is no fault of Lux!  Upon entering inside I realized it is a pretty hip joint and by that I mean all the local hipsters hang there.  But all in all it was a good mix of people working on their laptops right down to our group of indie music fanatics.  Time to order some coffee and a snack; seeing as how it was later in the evening I ordered a iced decaf soy vanilla latte and a strawberry corn muffin.  I had ordered one of the muffins that didn't sell too many that day and since they don't like to throw things out I got another for free, can't beat that!  Well, if velvet had a taste I'm pretty sure that it would taste like the coffee I drank.  I am generally leery to try decaf as it never quite seems to taste the same or a lot of places don't put much thought in to decaf since ""who orders coffee without the caffeine?""  I love coffee, especially GOOD coffee and I will take the decaf as long as it is as delicious as the leaded version.  Lux nailed it for me and I will be back no doubt!!  I can't wait to try something else....maybe just a simple cup of coffee with cream.",1,0,1

Our dear friends had brought me a pound of their beans which I thoroughly enjoyed. The ambiance is unique and noteworthy. I tried a cheddar jalapeño muffin which was a nice blend of sweet and savory. The coffee on the other hand was underwhelming. I got a whiteout cappuccino and my wife got a vanilla latte. Upon tasting the espresso in both drinks, I could taste an unpleasant bitterness which I describe as chemical or turpentine. This usually means the beans were improperly roasted. I also think the microfoam on the cappuccino could have been prepared better as it was more bubbly than a good cappuccino normally has.

*Hysterical cute man running the register

My girlfriend had the egg sandwich bacon tomato cheddar and egg. She enjoyed it. It was a tiny bit messy because of the egg, however satisfying overall.

Like I said, I have frequented Lux, almost daily, yet they have not offered me a ""punch card"" -- the only reason I knew about it was a co-worker told me about it (buy 10, get 1 free, or something along those lines).  Kinda bummed me out cause I like saving money and I've been a frequent customer...  I also order the exact same drink every time yet they don't remember nor do they remember my name (or how to spell it correctly) - which is cool, I get that they aren't mind readers or are supposed to remember who you are or whatevers but still, maybe more customer engagement would be nice.  Just sayin'.",6,0,0

Coffee drinks have always been good and I have also been enjoying some of the cocktail drinks as well. Not a huge fan of what food I have had there yet. So far I have only tried the breakfast and pastry items. Can't say if the lunch and\/or dinner items are any better. Definitely only come here if you have some time and are not rushing to get your pre-morning work coffee drink. I used to come here before work but now it takes too long.

Somehow Lux manages to imbue their espresso shots with a roasted marshmallow flavor that's unique and awesome. Sometimes a good latte from Cartel Coffee Lab will have a similar flavor, but I haven't encountered it anywhere else, including from 3rd wave coffee mecca Intelligentsia in LA. The lattes are the main reason I go to Lux; I've sampled some of the baked goods behind the glass display case, and the pies and quiches are quite good but I wouldn't make a special stop just for them.

I suppose the place is kind of hipster, but I've always found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming when I roll up in my very non-hipster khakis-and-oxford working clothes. Much more welcoming than Press Coffee and Cartel, for sure. Espresso pulls from Lux are also much, much more consistent than either Press or Cartel. A little rearranging of the ordering and pickup area would be welcome - coffees are delivered to the same spot where you order, which leads to traffic jams. But drinks come out relatively quickly so it's not really a big deal.

There is a lot of seating, but the place is always so hopping that you never know if you'll get a good spot to hang out or not. Worst case, there's a lot of communal tables where you can squeeze in. 

Bottom-line, go if you're a coffee freak seeking the perfect latte like myself. Their lattes absolutely give nothing away to avowed 3rd wave places like Intelligentsia or many others that I've tried. Kick back and enjoy the vibe and pretend you're in downtown SF or Berkeley while sipping the best lattes in town.",0,0,0

The clientele here make for highly entertaining people watching. At ten in the morning, there was the guy who never took his shades off, inside. His buddy next to him looked like a hired goon from a 1960s era James Bond, with slacks, a dark long sleeve button up shirt and a pony tail. Then in walked Phoenix's Russell Brand equivalent. Clearly either on molly or in a manic phase, homey was just LOVING life. Everyone in his path got a high five or a hug and a smile, with his dreads flopping this way and that. At some point he walked behind the counter like he owned the place, because apparently the baristas needed hugs and high fives too. Then his girlfriend walks in, a beautiful girl covered head to toe in body art. They eventually walk over to Shades and Igor and he introduces her to them. Her name is Goddess. I half expected her to begin an incantation, but apparently she wasn't so moved.

Not everyone in Lux is as awesome as these people, there are a fair share of people who didn't look like they throw their enemies into pools filled with sharks or have bipolar disorder. Boring people like me. Fortunately there will be enough characters who could have walked out of a B-movie that you shouldn't get bored. Suffice to say that you will likely be entertained.

Well, Lux is still around. And so am I. And Monday night we met again And I was very pleasantly surprised.

The coffee was not that great - a bit too acidic. But that's a personal taste issue, so I'm not going to spend any time on that. The place itself is great. The couches and chairs have a very pleasant lived-in feel. There were MANY people in there, but it felt cozy, not crowded. I have driven by and seen when the patio is full and people are spilling out, and I would probably stay away at those times.

I have read reviews that said basically 'the place is full of hipster douchebags' but that's just bigoted nonsense. Yeah, the place is full of hipsters, but I found the ones I chatted with to be quite nice. Everybody seemed to be having a good time, or studying and smiling.

Today, I ordered the Dutch Pancake. I did not like the burnt top part of the pancake. My friend says the last time she ordered it it was not burnt like that and tasted better. The unburnt part was Delish though but at 10 bucks it should be perfect! You can get it with fruit or veggies. My friend got the biscuits and gravy which I loved. Not too heavy or salty with a hint of Sage. 

Pros- Good food, fun vibe, cool decor, music, friendly folks, best coffee drinks in town I dare to say. 

Cons, Wowza this place is expensive, packed to the gills every time I have come, and Panne Bianco is right next door causing an eating choice dilemma -lol 

I am sure there must be an off time here to go to avoid the crowds. if you know what that time is let me know.

The decor, layout, the people there...really hipster for Arizona. I had the chicken tortilla soup (wasn't impressed) and some squash and risotto (that had no risotto in it because it apparently was reduced down to nothing) so it was basically just squash. Trust me, I asked. 

When you line up to order, someone takes your drink order first and starts making your drink.....and then you order your food separately. That sounds great...because it seems like it's more efficient, but then when we paid, we realized that the person that took our drink order didn't communicate that with the person that rung us up, we ended up not paying for the drinks, so we didn't get any drinks, and we only got our food. Hmmm...maybe efficiency doesn't always equal accuracy.

With delicious baked goods (I had a date scone...I don't really even LIKE dates, but the scone was delicious!) including cupcakes and handmade drinks (and you can choose disposable to-go cups or earth-saving ceramic -- love it!), it's adorable.

The DJ is a nice touch.  Everyone can do with a bit of mood enhancement in the morning.

I complained once... and the manager responded.  He was attentive and earnest.

As for the hip vibe... yes, it's all that - so the hipster admonishments in the other posts are a bit gratuitous.  If you don't like hipsters, go to Starbucks.  But, that is more about personal choice.  

If I have one ongoing peeve, it relates to the made-to-order food ordering.  I don't get the concept of running coffee orders before you reach the register - so that by the time you pay, the steaming brew is at the counter.  Why they don't extend the same service to food ordering is maddening.  The line can run out the door.  So, one stands in line for a good 15 mins to then have to place a food order and wait another 10-15mins for it to be ready.  PLEASE change that process.

Coffee: 
    Delicious. They roast their own beans and their baristas are well trained, even though there seems to be a different crew each of the last few times I've been in.

Iced Tea: 
    Strong but delightful, however no 32oz teas here. Less bang for your buck.

Alcohol: 
    Never had a drink here, but their menu can seduce me from across the room. Also, its a separate bar from the barista station, so a bartender is totally devoted to the cocktails. 

Food: 
   Pastries, YUM. Macaroni mug, DOUBLE YUM. 

Wifi: 
   Consistently good.

Price: 
    Sometimes it feels like I'm paying for the product + a cover charge for being allowed to be here. 

Service: 
    Unsure? Like I said, I've seen a slew of different staff here so I'm not sure if they have a huge crew or high turnover. Regardless, when I suggested to a friend that she should work here, she said, ""oh I'm not cool enough to do that"" and we both agreed that we would have a hard time competing with the persona embodied by the staff. They are what you think of when you think of 'indie', and along with that comes a certain attitude that I find welcoming when I'm donning trendy and standoffish when I'm not. ""Customer first"" is not a mantra I'd expect in their training, but I get that that comes with the territory of being 3rd wave.

Ambiance: 
    As I opened, this is the scene to be seen if you're trying to be included in the PHX counter-culture moment. With that comes some skepticism on my part as to wether or not Lux even fits in to 'counter-culture' anymore. Most everyone working or patroning is dressed for an album cover, so much so that it crosses the line from being a place that simply attracts that kind of person, to a place where people dress up to attend. Lux has become a pretentious venue in my mind, and I only come in when a friend wants to meet here or I am in the area needing a late night fix (they're open till midnight during the week- much later than most in PHX). 
    Also on 'ambiance', however, the set-up of the coffeehouse is completely unconventional, which is awesome and part of the draw. Mostly quirky, in some parts awkward, Lux is essentially a collection of rooms each with their own design elements. The interior layout is incongruous, which is refreshingly disruptive. There are plenty of wide tables for studying both inside and outside, as well as a large number of different lounge setups. But, I will note, finding a place to sit can be difficult, no matter what time of day you come. Because of this, I will finish by saying that the study environment won't work for everyone. Tonight I'm here to finish a paper and debated for a long time if that was a realistic goal given the crowd and noise. The Music is louder than other places too. I think for today, this is conducive to some good flow, but most of the time I turn elsewhere.

Check it out if you're visiting town, or if you and your friends need an after-activity when you're in the downtown area. But for a traditional, welcoming coffeeshop, keep looking.",2,0,1

I find Lux to be a bit of a love hate kind of place.  Parking can be  a battle because even though there are a lot of spots and on street parking, it can still be a battle finding a place to tie up your horse.  With free wifi and plenty of seating, Lux is a place you WANT to plop down for a while and do whatever it is you have to do but here it's ""coolness"" works against it as even with plenty of seating, It can be a bit like the 101 freeway at rush hour trying to find a place to sit.  

I wish I could say the coffee was what brought me in but to be honest, it's average at best.  The SERVICE is pretty good and the staff friendly and attentive.  The food items i've had both baked and prepared freshly have all been adequate (the Mac n Cheese with bacon and Jalapeno was tasty, served in a large portion for the money and well executed but fire roasting the japapenos prior to adding them in would have elevated this dish to excellence!)

So what keeps me coming?  Well, I can't think of anyplace i'd rather to go hang-out, MacBook in hand, to get some work done and people watch.  The atmosphere here is GREAT!  A mixture or modern and retro furniture, exposed beam ceilings, varied work spaces, and locally produced art are on par with and in my opinion rival similar concepts in NYC, Seattle or San Francisco.

Did I mention the full bar?  Fancy an adult beverage to take the edge off of that paper you need to write or the power point you're putting together for the ""big proposal"" at work?  You're in the right place.  The bartenders here will gladly mix you up anything from a classic coctail to a trendy CenPho treat to whet your whistle.  I'd give Lux 4 stars if it were a bar that served food and happened to have coffee.

If your looking for great coffee i'd recommend Press Coffee Roasters, Cartel Coffee Lab or Echo Coffee. Lux is definitely my choice if you're looking for a place to socialize, sit and get a little work done, plow through homework or just hang out and people watch.

Their food is delicious, their drinks are delicious, their pastries are delicious, their bar is VERY well stocked, their service is outstanding, their ambiance is electric, their brand is SOLID... If not for having to park half a mile down the street then elbow my way through a teaming mass of hipster humanity, LUX could be my everyday go-to.

In all seriousness, if you haven't been here before, you need to check it out. It's the ultimate coffee bar, which is saying a lot since the Phoenix area is host to a whole lot of those (with more sprouting up every day, it seems).

One of my favorite things about LUX is that, despite the constant surge of customers, everyone who works here always seems to ENJOY working here. Honestly, I don't know that I've ever had such consistently positive service anywhere else.

I can't recommend LUX highly enough. And truth be told, there ARE in-between hours where the rush dies down and you actually CAN find a spot to park at with your computer for a while and take it all in. So give it a whirl - you won't be disappointed.",7,1,3

Like, I'm surrounded by the most beautiful people, and also the most hipster, and also the pinkest leather couches and chairs, and it's some old industrial chic thing, and no real sign on the building, and seriously, I do not have enough cool points to enter.

And yet, I did enter.

And I sorta loved it. Ya, it's a bit of a scene. You just kinda crowd the barista area and get your coffee (drip only) and some kind of pastry or scone. Then you camp out on the sofas, the tables, the big communal tables in one of the back rooms, or just sit and soak it in. On this particular day, one of the back rooms had a news feed projected on the wall, showing the big political event of the day. No idea if they always show news\/tv\/whatever, but that could be interesting too.

There's a small menu of prepared dishes as well, but I didn't grab one. It looked to be like small comfort breakfast foods with an elevation. The ambiance is quintessentially hipster, but I actually love that in this case. Why do some people think that's a bad thing? Well dressed dudes with beards and dreads, and delightfully modern women with vintage dresses? Ya, I'm down. I'm not cool enough for that crowd, but I'm down.

White chocolate apricot scone is a hit, as was the quiche lorraine. I'm not a coffee dude, but caffeine snobs might not love that you can't get a pour over. Get over it. Pop in, join the army of laptop warriors, and stay a while. Are you cool enough?",12,8,11

I heard they charge a cover if you don't bring a Mac.

All clientele jokes aside, this really is a place where an average Joe like myself can grab, well, an above-average cup of Joe. And more. This place has some apparently good eats, baked goods (some of which are vegan!), amazing teas, and a groovy beer selection.

I opted for an ""Earl Greyer"", because good black tea owns. This stuff was dank! The barista took the tiny pouch out of a can, and I could smell the bergamot from pretty far away. ""Let it steep"" he said, giving me about five minutes to scour Lux for this review. Here are some observations:

-I have excellent vision, but the menus printed on two windows were admittedly a pain to read. Sure you don't want to have some in print?

-The area to order and the area to wait seemed to be the same place. There is no clear line, but more of an amorphous bunch of people eager for service.

-The layout appears to encourage openness. Too bad most people are too busy typing away to enjoy what could really be a bustling social scene. Come on, there's amazing goodies, great music (I swear I heard some Band of Horses), and a bar. Live it up a little people!

-While the cooks were having a great time, I don't think my barista cracked a smile at any point. You have a great job. Enjoy it! 

Overall, I just have some minor beef with Lux's interior. A haphazard design that can easily confuse newcomers appears to be an avenue of pretentiousness rather than a chance to showcase aesthetics. 

But I'll stop nitpicking, I like this place a lot. Can't wait to try more!",6,7,7

For me, it's all about a shop's product. You can have whatever decor, or be a douchebag, or overcharge for your wares, but if you can deliver on what you sell, then you're alright. 

That, is parallel what Lux delivers. They are are, first and foremost, a coffee shop. And, time and time and time again, they deliver a premium, tasty, excellent cup of coffee. Whats more? it's 2 bucks. 2 american dollars for a - get this - endless cup of brew. And that's all I ever really want, a quality cup of coffee all hours of the day. 

That being said, it's can be difficult to get past the occasional worker who seems to be unhappy all the time, or the barista who doesn't seem to have enough time to even look you in the eye. 

But damn, that coffee. 

The ambiance is good, with lots of different seating inside and outside, and they serve not only coffee, but alcohol and food as well.

After moving downtown, Lux has become my new favorite coffee shop, breakfast spot, dessert spot and dinner spot. This place is ridiculously good. Their coffee is on spot and consistent throughout the day. Their egg sandwich is inexpensive (5$), yet super high quality. They actually make their food in *gasp* pans! No microwaves here. The egg sandwich is an over medium egg on an english muffin with cheese, bacon, and a roasted tomato. So good. Now, as good as that is, the biscuits and gravy are even better. This is what the BF gets for breakfast and what I eat off his plate when he's not looking :-P. The gravy has chunks of delicious sausage (and I don't generally care for sausage). The gravy is very well seasoned and full of flavor. Then, this week, we went to Lux for dinner. We had the bacon\/jalapeno mac and cheese and the yorkshire pudding burger. The mac and cheese was creamy, spicy, salty and delicious. The burger was a knife and fork burger that had very flavorful meat (almost meatloaf ish) and a really good horseradish -y sauce. Finally, their desserts....I crave their desserts, especially their peanut butter brownie. That brownie is so awesome because it has the saltyness of the peanut butter and a rich and sweet chocolate flavor of the brownie....it's like magic. Brownies are never my first choice for a dessert....except here. This place continues to impress me and I will continue to frequent Lux at all hours of the day...",3,1,2

A haven for the ""hipster"" and ""indie"" crowds, it is frequently populated with would be iconoclasts who, if you move past the stereotypes usually cast upon such people, are largely friendly and unpretentious.

The service is earnest and talented producing some of the best cappucinos, americanos and other assorted caffeinated beverages in town. The various baked goods are reasonably priced and obviously crafted with care providing stark contest to the mass-produced crap most coffee shops sling with something like disdain for their customers.

I only hesitate to award the fifth star for lack of experience with the other offerings of food and drink they offer. An omission to my experience I hope to soon include.

EDIT: Since I never got around to posting this review after my first visit and subsequently visited numerous times I can confirm this to be a five-star establishment. In addition to the quality coffee beverages they offer their bar was (and likely still is) quite well stocked and competently tended. They offer a very solid selection of quality liquors and beers (can't speak confidently to their wine selection, I'm not much for the vino).

Their classic drip coffee is also really good! Usually premade drip coffee tastes old, bitter, and gross.

I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we don't have anymore of that one.""

Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche.

The line to get coffee is ridiculous and there is no sense of order whatsoever in the place.

Lux to me is more of a pick-up joint and not a coffee bar.  Everyone in this joint has a MacBook or MacBook Pro or iPad or iPhone.

The ambience inside varies on where you sit (couch, bar, back rooms), but either way you'll feel so relaxed and hip. They do get pretty busy, and although it has never happened to me, I imagine sometimes there isn't anywhere to sit.

For breakfast, I typically order the Aunt Gladys. It is SO much value on one plate!! One big stack of hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, topped with some delicious salsa! It's super filling and I can't rave enough about the quality of the bacon. It's a tender belly pork bacon and once you try it TRUST ME you'll want to find out where to buy for home!

PROS:
* Their coffee and baked goods are pretty tasty. I got a chilled mocha and it was the right kind of chocolaty and the right kind of caffeinated-buzz. I also got a croissant (because I saw one next to me and immediately decided that I wanted it) and it was fluffy and delicious.

* The coffee shop is huge, so it allows you to find a chair, nook, couch SOMEWHERE or if you come with friends you can all hang around together in some corner. The store has different spaces so keep looping around if you don't see any free spots at first. 

* The music selection is quite cool and makes the ambiance pretty happy and chill. The decor is funky so there is a large combination of chairs, tables, sofas for every taste.

* It turns into a bar, well, its always a bar but you can go for both coffee-drinking time or boozy time. I have not had their drinks, but they have a cool bar setup and a large selection of fresh ingredients for (hopefully) a successful execution.


CON:
* Its effing pricey. For reals, its not a ""round the corner"" coffee shop so assume that your coffee price includes everything from ""ambiance"" to ""the price of being seen"" to everything in between.

* The music. Its loud. If you are here to study, well, don't. I came here to read (not knowing any better) and I struggled with a mixture of how loud the music was (even tho i liked the selection!) and the even louder dumbass sorority girls next to me chatting their lives away. This place is social, not a shelter for your quiet-needs. Let me repeat that:

THIS PLACE IS LOUD. DO NOT COME HERE FOR PEACE AND QUIET.

* Parking. The lot is always (always full), so expect to park on the street wherever you can find. This can sometimes be a challenge, but they have 2hr parking on the street and some back lot, which I am not sure if we are allowed to use.


So there it is folks, the good, the bad and the not-so-ugly. I am ashamed and happy for giving into the hype and trying this place out. I'm not a hipster, a coffee-snob or anything, but I do love anywhere with great quality food and drinks where I feel welcome. Isn't that what its all about anyway?",8,2,3

The lines are long, yes...but this is some of the best coffee in town, so IT'S WORTH IT. Also, the staff is great about having the drinks ready shortly after you pay - they take your drink order while you're still waiting in line to reach the register.

I'm new to Phoenix and had just about given up on trying to find a place to go and sit and work around creative people AND get good coffee while I'm there. As an academic, I've kind of built my life around working in good coffee shops. So when I moved here I figured I'd have to rethink all of that. Not so! Lux is my new fave. 

The coffee is real: espresso drinks are made by hand, not machine. I agree with others here that the beans aren't that great though. Even though it's not the absolute best coffee I've ever had (I'm a lifelong Peet's fan), it's certainly not reason to skip going here. 

On the other hand, the service is AMAZING. They remembered my name, made sure I got stamps on my frequent buyer card, and offered to heat my croissant in a REAL TOASTER and not some lameass microwave. I got a nice little pot of jam and a smear of real butter, too. They seemed to know I was new there, which indicates to me that they have a ton of regulars and make a sincere effort to get to know them.

There are plugs and free wifi and I don't feel pressured to leave before I'm ready. Lots of great people-watching, too. (Last time I was there, a woman in her mid-30s wearing a Slint t-shirt came in with her kid-- very cool.) There's nothing dirty about this place and I don't feel like I'm sitting in someone's basement, drinking coffee off of thrift store furniture. It's very much an adult coffee shop that encourages you to hang out for a while, either indoors or out. (FYI, there are nice benches and grassy spots around the building in addition to the tables under the awning out front.)

I only wish it were bigger, a little quieter, and much closer to where I live. I also wish it opened before 7 but that's just because I need something to make me want to get up earlier and get working. 

To be honest, since I moved to Phoenix 6 weeks ago I thought I was doomed to a life of grading my students' papers from any number of commercial or mediocre coffee shops. I have also had a hard time finding places to go where my people are at. You can imagine what a sigh of relief I expressed when I settled in with my cappuccino at Lux. So nice to be there.",1,0,1

There are lots of partitioned rooms now so you can explore and see which room fits your mood best for the day.

I think Lux is an amazing example of authentic excellence. Whenever I think about branding, Lux always comes to mind as a great example. They know exactly what they are. They don't try to be anything else. They do an amazing job of executing every part of who they are.

First of all, the coffee rocks. They roast their own beans and are our favorite in town. Then the drinks they make are not only delicious but also beautiful. So many nice touches. Latte art. Homemade whipped cream with a touch of  honey. Sugared rim & slice of lemon on the lemonade. Fresh squeezed juices. McClendon Farms honey as a condiment. They serve their drinks in china & glass (cool non-institutional mugs & glasses) if you're drinking there. They even have killer lids for their to go coffee. Their straws are super thick & you never have to worry about them getting crimped.

If it didn't all taste good, I guess it wouldn't matter. But it does & every little aspect adds to the experience for me.

Same with their food. Great snacks. Served on china. Heated & served with a slab of real butter if it's supposed to be.

Cool decor. Changing local art on the walls. Great music playing. Free wifi.

The only thing that bugs me at all about Lux is how crowded it's become. In the scheme of things, I guess that's good because we know Lux will be around & it also says a lot for the taste of Phoenicians.

I have heard one other criticism - that the folks there can be snooty. I myself have never seen that & experienced the absolute opposite time after time. I often come with 2 little kids too so I'd expect if anybody was going to get the snoot, it'd be me.

I just plain love Lux. If it were closer to my house, I'd be there even more.",3,2,3

You can chill out here by yourself or meet up with a group and it's awesome either way. I'm not super familiar with the food but anything that I've ordered in the past has been fine. Personally, I cannot study or work here because I get too distracted with how many people come in and out but that's just me. The staff here but they are all nice enough and they make consistently good stuff. 

One thing that seems to annoy me every time, however, is their stamp card promotion, or lack-thereof (you get a free drink after buying 10). It is totally worth it if you go there often. It might sound dumb, but I always feel like I'm inconveniencing someone to either stamp my card or get a new one. Then, when I get my free drink, it seems like I'm a horrible person for using a system that they have available. If you're a frequent patron of Lux and had no idea they even had these cards available, I'm not surprised. They don't advertise it for some reason. I was going there for years before I found out it was even available. I just happened to be eavesdropping on the the guy in front of me in line. Then when I asked the cashier how long they'd been doing it for, the condescending, teenage, hipster cashier said, ""Uhh, like, forever. It's been years or something. Where have you been?"" Hey, thanks. I've actually been here. Cool response though. That was super helpful.

Lux has a primo location, next to Pane Bianco, just off a train station, and in a great neighborhood. They have a great patio which they share with Bianco, that even though it is loud, it is a nice spot to hang out. 

Their coffee prices are more than fair, $2 for a large coffee, and decent tasting. The biggest thing was not having to pay additional tax, as they have worked it into the prices. I never realized how angry it makes me when something is like $2.03 and I have to walk around with a pocketful of change all day. So those are all the plusses, but I've had a few negative reports as well.

This may or may not be normal, but on my visit, it was a like an akward library. They did not have any music on, there was little to no conversation between customers, and it was very quiet.

The interior is inviting, and the exterior has a lovely view. Their music is pleasant (and can be found on Spotify). The staff are as sweet as the pastries. Seriously, the bakers, the baristas, the chefs, & the bartenders are all so hospitable and personable, and remember your name if you're a regular. 
But of course, the Jewel of the Royal-Crown-Masterpiece that is Lux Cafe, is its food & drinks. Review their customer-submitted photos of their coffee and tea. They have a full bar. Yeah! A bar! And they're drinks are fantastic! 
And ooooh, but the food though! The Food Though! They're breakfast egg, bacon, & hash dishes! They're pastries! They're salads! They're sandwiches! ...

I was looking for a place in the area for a nice chai latte before heading to rehearsals, and this place had the highest \/ most reviews, figured I had to give it a shot.  I actually went in three different businesses looking for this one, so right off the bat I feel like an idiot.  I ordered my chai, even though I wasn't sure they had it - because there really is no menu displaying what your options are (I'm certain this is in an effort to be cool).  The beverage was ok, nothing special, but ended up costing me almost six bucks.  I will give them this - the ambiance is pretty amazing.  There are many places to sit and chill, lots of nooks and funky chairs, including a pretty cool back patio.

We went Thanksgiving morning and it was packed (which I love).  The ambiance is, like, textbook hipster, I think.  Some rugged wood, funky lamps, deviant art and coffee.  Not to mention a few fedora hats, skinny jeans and beards (but those weren't exclusive to the establishment).  I dug it.

Price. Eh, steep, but not too bad.

The food was delicious.  I got the savory pancake and it was totally not what I had envisioned, but it was awesome and I would so get it again.

Service was friendly and customer positive.  The one thing I didn't like was their pick up system.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  It was loud, so I didn't know if we'd hear our names or not.  We stood near the counter but somehow still missed our drinks.  Apparently they got cold so they set them aside (understood), but I don't know how we didn't hear them...so, yeah, the system didn't work for us.  Otherwise, the folks met are needs and were totally cool when we asked where our teas were.

However, for my birthday we ordered one of their awesome cakes since it's my favorite. Called and spoke with one of their pastry people she gave me her cell telling me it was the best way to place the order. So we placed the order about 5 days in advance she said everything was good to go. I gave my name, order, and pick up time (1pm), seemed easy enough. Well, my birthday arrived and we went to pick up said cake- well you guessed it, it wasn't ready. The man working the counter looked at me like i was crazy while he went to inquire about my order. We can see him and the girl i'm assuming who took my order, looking around and starting to rifle through things and go through her phone! After waiting an additional 45 min (when i was told they just had to pull it out of the fridge) and watching them slap it together, mind you the man on the counter was the one who actually put the frosting on, not the pastry person, I finally received my cake. No ""thanks for your patience"" or ""sorry about the wait"" or for forgetting my order completely. 
So, sadly this is why I cannot give Lux the 5 stars I wish I could. I have been here many times and am a loyal customer and frequent, this experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Overall, I really like this place but I can see how one who isn't super trendy or artsy might be intimidated when they first show up. My advice is to go again, a lot of different types of people go there and are really friendly.

The wait in line and fighting to find a seat to eat blows and Lux, you can do better.  Fellow Yelppers there is a line for a reason....it's mostly because the food is awesome but it's also because the set up is probably the most inefficient set up you could have.  This is a popular joint and if you have all the time in the world by all means....give Lux a shot.  However, if you only have 1.5 hours to kill for breakfast head here.

Lux, do your fans a favor and give us table service.  Don't make us wait in a 20 min line for a coffee refill.  I did not mind the wait on day 1 because you were new to me and your space is interesting. However, after 5 solid days of coming back for your crack I began to resent how much time I was wasting on my vacation.  I also had plenty of time to think of ways you could do crowd management differently.

As u walk in you have seating everywhere the ordering area ahead of you where they have a large display of baked goods, not a the best sight to look at if you're looking to cut the carbs. Then to the right is more seating and a full alcohol bar. There's even more seating if u go down another hallway which leads to more rooms and to a large outdoor patio. Basically the place is huge for a coffee shop.

I sat at the bar area whipped out my laptop immediately notice very fast Wi-Fi and also a plug power cord below my feet to keep my laptop charged which is key. A bartender\/barista came over pretty fast and I ordered a tropical iced teas which was very good.  They also have a full breakfast\/lunch\/dinner menu. Artwork was plentiful on the walls and the music and ambience screamed hipster cool. Service was fast and everybody seemed friendly.

Tonight was the first night that I went to Lux with the purpose of relaxing with friends. I can't tell you what a completely different experience this was! Blaise, the bartender, blew me away with his delicious and hand-crafted drinks. One drink literally had a arrow, craftily cut from the rind of an orange; and all were delicious. 

I can't tell you how relaxed I was sitting at the bar (where they serve drinks and food). It was a 180 from my experiences using Lux to engage in less fun activities!

That's why I'm giving Lux five stars--- I have always loved their coffees, teas, baked goods, salads and entrees, but I was stressed for my own reasons.

But I used to be big on Starbucks and now I don't care for them anymore. Then I fell in love with a coffee shop called Crossroads Bookstore and Coffee on Olive Ave and 83rd ave. This place is still my favorite though. But I don't live nearby so I don't really get to go as often as I used to when I had the time freedom. I've also never been much of a fan of Dutch bros. I tried them a couple times. But then I worked for a new and uprising company who became their competitor called Desert Eagle on 51st Ave and Bell Road. Their set up is just like Dutch bros. Menu and the way there is two drive thrus and a walk up. But I like the coffee better. To me it's roasted better. The owner himself roasts it in the back of the building just about every day if not every other day. But I don't go there for personal reasons. So I've never been here a couple times. I've only had one specific drink and the Mac n cheese. But let me tell you, the Mac n cheese is the best Mac n cheese you'll find on earth! You can get it plain or with bacon and jalapeños or just one of those items. And the drink I got, it's either the red velvet or just the velvet. And I like my drinks iced so I get that as an iced latte. It's not too sweet but not too bland. There's 2 annoying things about this place though. It's ALWAYS packed and the parking lot is ALWAYS full. Sometimes you'll get lucky and drive through the parking lot hoping someone is leaving and then you'll get their spot. Otherwise you have to find parking near by on the streets. Oh and there is inside seating too. But that even gets full too. My friend and I had a hard time finding seating. But that's okay.

Upon entering the coffee bar you greeted with a smooth ultra urban vibe that is not pretentious, arrogant, nor fake. The service is outstanding, the bakery\/deli products are amazing and delicious. The beans are hand roasted in the 'Employee Lounge' and are made into the perfect caramel shots poured into the perfectly stretched milk from a very talented barista.

I used to enjoy the interesting and happy, laid back crowd of people that tended to flock to Lux to sip a coffee while working on their laptops or chatting for a while over a dessert. 

 For some reason- is it the larger meals?  the alcohol?  the bigger more comfortable seats?  the typewriters?  the extra bathroom?- the new Lux draws a totally different demographic... mostly over 40 and under 5.  Think yoga pants or church dresses... with a bunch of poorly behaved kids yelling ""Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.... DAD!"", running, and twirling around in a crowded space with adults carrying full-to-the brim coffee cups.  Or worse, the screaming infants of hipster (or used to be) parents who can't let go... they honestly think they can remain cool by sitting on the couch sipping Velvets while the entire place is subjected to their bawling infants whom they expect everyone to find adorable.  Really??!

It IS mildly entertaining to watch the interaction between the burgeoning ""family""\/senior citizen\/Christian Sunday morning crowd (""Liam, sit down, honey.  Liam, Liam, Liam... stop that, Liam.  Stop licking the nice lady's scone.... it's not yours. LIAM!"") with the fit, handsome gay men, the brilliantly overweight and pierced\/tattooed lesbians, pseudo business people, and liberal graduate students.  

Younger\/trendy crowd seems to get drinks to go now.  Those who stay are ogled by mid lifers who want to know all about your computer or your cell phone and have no qualms about interrupting your work for a free tech lesson.  You also run the risk of toddlers sipping from your straw if your drink is left on the table.  

Or maybe you will enjoy being pushed out of the way by a 40 year old woman in yoga pants who simply MUST get her iced mocha right this second?  If not, you may want to get that coffee to go... quickly!  

The Sunday DJ is amazing.  His music could be my ""church"".  So, it was sad that today I could only hear toddlers, soccer moms, etc. yelling over the music about nothing of importance or interest.  :-(

My coffee order was up, and I have to say I'm pleased with the presentation, very swanky, and the latte itself was good, the creamy froth stayed though out the entire drink, you know how sometimes it fades away, not here, it was frothy creamy all the way to the last drop.  I enjoyed it very much.

Their ""house blend"" used for their espresso drinks is WAYYY too roasted. Honestly, I think they scorch their coffee beans that they use for their espresso drinks. Additionally, they don't rinse the espresso spoons so each drink has burnt espresso residue.  ALSO, their chai is fucking horrible. Worst chai I think I have ever tasted in my life. I basically payed 4.75 for iced milk. Not strong at all. If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders. 

Their food is pretty pricey as well and their portion sizes are pretty small. 10 dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you. 


Other than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix. 

I'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol.

I guess we could just chalk them up to someone who must have been having an all around bad day that day, I forgive them. 

LUX is awesome because it's not your run of the mill coffee shop, with everyone behind the counter talking in half crazy coffee tongue that no one understand, yelling across the building ""JOHN!!!"" ""EMILY!!!!"", and all look like a corporate machine in their matchy matchy green aprons. 

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the amazing smell, they roast their own coffee right there in the shop and it fills the air with sweetest smell, Love it! Yes, some people have a problem with ""all the furniture"" inside. But seriously, if you cant handle being close to other people, maybe interacting beyond your laptop, and possibly meeting some cool people then no, this place isn't for you. Go ahead and take your butt to Starbucks where you can not be bothered, and you are calling me snobby and pretentious? B**** please, get over yourself! 

The winter is my favorite time to frequent LUX! Beyond their amazing caramel latte (with the cutest little foam designs on top) they have some of the best pastries and yummy treats. Last year they had the best cranbarry-barry crumble thing, I about died and went to heaven, so good! 

They also feature artist from the valley on their walls. It's kind of like a gallery at times, because you can buy the art too. There are some pretty interesting things up at times. 

LUX is great! You must check it out. If there is a long line don't let it scare you, unlike some other coffee places (caugh-Starbucks-caugh), they move with a quickness and you never have to wait to long.",3,3,2

Secondly, the coffee is great and the pastries are fan-freaking-tastic. Just the thought of the sweet (cupcakes!) and the savory (feta and sun dried tomato scone!) options makes my mouth water. Sometimes I wish that they ventured into sandwiches, though they don't really seem to have the kitchen space.

Groovy things about Lux--  You will love it the minute you walk in. I don't believe in love at first sight... but love at first entrance to Lux?  It happened.  They roast amazing coffees. So a good old- fashioned cup of coffee tastes Delicious. How much is that big beautiful cafe going to cost you?  $2. Are there free refills?  YES!  That is off the rocker cool!!  I have a local favorite coffee shop in Tucson and are my refills free?  Nope. The selection of quality coffee drinks and breakfast treats is still on my mind.  I also am thrilled that they offer soy milk, almond milk and organic milk.  Almond milk is my milk of choice. I wish every coffee shop had almond milk.  I'm so over soy.  So if I was to have an iced chai at Lux, I could pay an extra .50 and have my almond milk.
Next time I am at Lux, which will be on my next Phoenix trip... I am having one of those iced mochas that I saw so many peeps drinking.  They put a dollop of cream in the mochas... I can't wait to have my own!  Cannot get over how rad Lux is!",4,1,2

Every time I come to Lux, I glance past the mac-n-cheese. I mean, how exciting can American restaurant mac-n-cheese be? A customer sitting next to me at the bar ordered up a bowl. It looked pretty enticing. He asked if I ever had it before. I said no, and he looks me straight in the eyes and says ""you gotta do it."" By the tone of his voice, the mac-n-cheese must have been an experience.

So tonight I did it, but instead it done me...oh it done me. It done me good.

Beatles fans, holla if you hear me!

I learned to make proper ""macaroni pie"" from a West Indian friend. You slow-cook milk, cheese, onion, a bit of flour, salt, and pepper into a delicious, aromatic cheesy creamy white soup. Then you pour al-dente elbow pasta into a baking dish. Then you pour the creamy cheese soup deliciousness over the pasta. Then you layer shredded cheese on top and bake it all together. That's how you get tender, creamy mac-n-cheese. Lux knows the deal, and they took it up a notch by throwing jalapeno peppers and bacon into the mix.

As a baked mac-n-cheese chef trained under a West Indian macaroni pie sensei, I tip my hat to you, Lux. Well done.

Edited: A tip for Ms. Andrea O. Being a pleasant customer goes a long way. Being not-a-mega-bizatch works wonders for getting good service. It works for me. You may want to try it sometime. If you suffer from perma-scowl, you could draw a smiley face on a paper bag and place it over your head.",4,4,0

I find these few negative reviews rather funny.  I will comment on them after the more important stuff, like the actual quality you will find at LUX.

I have been coming here since 2003.  It was a tiny box back then, but one of the first and only places one could find a Dirty Chai.  In fact, it was one of the only places you could find good coffee or a barista in Phoenix back then.  Sorry, starbucks is NOT good coffee, so that doesn't count.

That being said, it has grown, expanded and pretty much delivers one of everything you could want.  The ingredients are always fresh...  baking goods constantly.  They do not EVER skimp on quality of ingredients.  The prices are just ridiculously UNDER priced for what you are getting.  

The mixology bar or ""bar"" if you will is LOADED with top shelf booze and fresh ingredients as well...  I know this because every morning when I go to get my coffee, the morning bartenders are squeezing fresh juice from just about everything you can imagine.  

The breakfast items are amazing and consistent every time...  and again, totally affordable.  Coffee for a cup is $2?  Where do you even get a $2 cup of coffee anymore?  Here.  So do the baristas a favor and put that extra dollar you just saved in that ceramic jar just to the side of the register, they will appreciate it.  

Dinner is equally fresh.  They offer a spartan menu of gourmet items made with FRESH ingredients handled with care.  Mac N Cheese is always on the menu for $5 - it has almost made me a fat kid it's so addicting and good.

It seems most people complain about it being too crowded or overly hipster...  I mean seriously folks, it is good.  It is popular.  So there may be a lot of people there. You might have to park on the street and walk 500 feet to get there.  You aren't going to die.  The hip people, the yuppies, the business professionals, the bohemes, the families, they aren't going to hurt you.  You don't need to waste time criticizing people, that is just too hypocritical to your point.  Just be yourself like everyone else is.

and to the service...  they hire awesome people here.  They are are highly skilled at what they do.  I find them a pleasant bunch.  Most of them are young, so things like fashion and music are important to them...  maybe that is why you think they are overly hip.  They are not uptight or mean by any measure.  If you get bad service here it is probably because you are being an entitled asshole perhaps.  

Bottom line, it is pretty much the first and best in Phoenix and still upholds the quality it started with.  It has grown just as much as Phoenix has.

To finish our meal, Katie cooked an apple bar pastry with cinnamon, ginger, and the surprise ingredient everyone loves, apple-wood bacon. Plus an after dinner luxury gin and tonic.

It was good, i think i read that they make the chai by scratch, so no concentrate. thats a bonus. I really like this place, but its a little far to be my local coffee shop. I really like the decor (not sure what it would be called), but the place is a little confusing at first. I saw the sign\/billboard, but only saw the italian restaurant. Thankfully i wandered the correct direction. I walked in and the entrance is actually the side of the shop (if there is another oops). i was a little confused but made my way through, knowing i was in the correct location because everyone had coffee cups, iced and hot. I found the ""menu"" on a glass written with liquid chalk (love it). and pastries all over! 

The pastry choices were plentiful, finding where to order a little difficult, because it looked like it was part of the pastry ""display table"". i'd come back i like the atmosphere a lot + it's next to slippery pig bike shop!",0,1,2

Delicious pastries, breakfasts and solid baristas preparing solid espresso drinks; the last of which is not easy to find in Phoenix (my guess is due to the heat and locals' preference for cold bevvies). Normally a place this good I'd give 5 stars to. I'm a regular when in town, the service is excellent, the space is cool and for a more food centered establishment they make great coffee beverages. My issue is 1) the price of their coffee drinks. I am sympathetic to the rising costs of coffee but given the cost of living in Phoenix (and rents) combined with the fact that their coffee drinks, while good, are not top tier: $4.50 for an 8oz latte is way above the market. In San Diego, where all costs are significantly higher in running a business, I can get the same drink for $3.25 to $3.75. That's a large variance percentage wise. Issue 2) throw me a bone on some healthier options. Lux has the capacity to make healthy items but just opts to generously use oil, butter, or what have you. I frankly find this is a Phoenix phenomena, but would have expected a place like Lux to offer some slightly lighter food options. Even if it is just one for each meal of the day. And vegetarian doesn't automatically qualify as light as an aside! 

My nitpicking aside, I highly recommend Lux, but know your wallet will be lighter and you will be heavier.",2,0,0

They make their Chai from scratch every morning and it is simply delightful. My other drink of choice here is their fresh squeezed lemonade which could be a hair cheaper but is simply delightful.

The people working here are great and now how to do their job well. Since I spend most of my time in Chicago I only get out here a couple of times a year and some recognize my face after a long absence and try to remember my name. Don't think they have ever gotten it right when they guess but the fact that they try and know I get an extra spicy chai is nothing short of impressive.

You will either love or hate the decor in here but personally I love it. Forget what the style is called but basically if it was 1970 and you wanted to design a futuristic place I think you'd get close to this. Always busy but I have never not been able to find a seat if I needed to stay for a bit.

Lux has been good about sticking to a small menu and doing it well. New Batista's are quickly up to snuff. 
I like the clean modern sixties Scottsdale feel. second owner seemed to have brought in a neighborhood crowd that gets a little territorial with the place with their children and laptops. Lux should really turn off the wi-fi during peak hours and keep the place from looking like a home office.

It wasn't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out. I had a small, non-fat sugar free vanilla latte ($4) and picked up a homemade, oatmeal creme sandwich for $3. 

Pluses: I love the msmatched, kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable. Free WiFi, and a wide variety of baked goods. I can ALWAYS be sold on baked goods. This might be a weird plus, but I was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside. I am probably the only person that never had this before, but who cares, I loved it. Totally refreshing on a hot AZ night. 

Neutral: The employees weren't exactly friendly but weren't rude, either...just kind of indifferent. Hmmm, correct that, they were very friendly with the regulars but I sort-of felt unwelcome at first but I quickly got over that. 

Negatives: The music is too loud. Maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but I was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what I was studying. Don't get me wrong, I loved the music but it was a bit much. Okay, alot much.

The whipped cream here is prooooobably the best thing I've ever tasted, like, ever. I can't rave about it enough. But when you put it on top of a perfectly sweetened, creamy, icy, doesn't-even-really-taste-like-coffee beverage, it's heaven. 

I asked the staff how they make their espresso so damn good, and they said they don't do anything different; they say it's most likely the roasting machines that have been ""seasoned"" with so much use that makes it so good.

However, on the second date she told me that she wanted to be friends because of her complicated life right now.  I'm holding out hope for something more, but meanwhile, I'm going to move on to other women, who I will probably have less chemistry with.  

As for the drink and customer service, my iced chai was great, but not one of the best I've ever had either.  They were quite friendly in there, which I greatly appreciated.

Definitely would come back.  Hopefully, on a date which leads to a relationship.  This place is magicial....haha.",0,4,0

When I saw it and where it was, I realized I'd been here like four years ago. I jumped on the lightrail and headed up from downtown since it is only about 4 stops, but I screwed up and got off at Indian School. Don't do this, or you're walking. Stay on one more stop, and you're here!

Walking up to the place, it was pretty cool. Sail material over communal long tables makes it easy to meet new people, or relax in the shade with your caffeine and earphones. I wanted to work inside since I'd planned to stay for several hours (papers to grade!) so I headed in. The line wasn't too bad (I hear it can get bad some hours of the day) and the barista was really friendly. I got my usual (a black coffee) and it was $2.00. No problem. The ambiance struck me immediately. The lights were very soft and easy to work under. There were about 30 people, two dozen of them were on laptops, most were MACs, and since I too am an Apple FanBoy, I was stoked. Grabbed a seat near the cash register across from a beautiful woman studying religion and medicine (checked out her books next to her MacBook). I hate when the coffee is too hot (Starbuck's), and this coffee was perfect. Shot some pics, booted up my MacBookPro, logged into the free wireless, and I've been sitting here ever since. This place is everything everyone has ever said about it. Great great coffee house.

Instead I ordered a brown rice dish with chicken and vegetables, jalapeño bacon mac & cheese, and a squash soup. Even though there were about 10 of us, we were able to find a spot on one of the benches. 

The interior design was really trendy, hipster and retro. It was as though I was in someone's basement. The table was adorned with baskets of oranges and functional  old-school type writers. You can also sit at these chairs with tables stacked with books. A very unique vibe. It reminded me much of Valley Bar.

We arrived roughly after 9am on a Monday morning. Lux appeared to be nestle in a cool and hip part of Phoenix as there were some interesting shops and restaurants in it's proximity. Lux has it's own parking lot, which I'm not sure that is shared with the other business,but when we arrived there was ample parking spaces. 

On the exterior, there is a somewhat spacious patio allowing patrons to sit outside when weather permits. On the inside there is an eclectic array of mix n  match furniture which gives it that cool vibe. There is a small kitchen open to the room showcasing their variety of baked goods. It was very cool to see the employees working as we were waiting for our food. 

I ordered my usual breakfast when I'm in a rush or wanting to eat light, a butter croissant and glass of orange juice. The croissant was very good, very airy and decent flakiness. The orange juice was freshly squeezed. My friend ordered the quiche which was warmed up in their conventional oven instead of the microwave.

I really wanted to like Lux based on the reviews, but there are things that prevent me from rating it higher. 

#1 - I once wondered where all the hipsters roamed in Phoenix. Then I went to Lux and I wondered no more. Pretty much everyone had an apple laptop here. Me and my vaio were the odd ones out. This is just an observation and has not a lot to do with the overall rating. 

#2 - It was crazy crowded in the middle of a weekday. The place itself isn't that big, so I assume there's a big following (confirmed by the number of reviews for this place). This made it difficult to lay my things out and have adequate study space. 

#3 - Smaller space + people = really narrow walk ways when people are standing in line to order.

#4 - Coffee is good, but not as strong as I personally like. 

With that said, the perks here are ambiance (fun art on the walls that I imagine are changed everyone once in awhile), good people watching, parking despite the amount of people here, and the fact that its by the light rail. 

So yep, Lux is a solid coffee spot, but I think I'll keep looking for the coffee shop of my dreams.. with table space and stronger coffee.",1,0,1

That sort of personal touch means a lot to me, and despite some of the pretense--like having a DJ on a Friday morning (spinning good tunes, I might add)--it's comfortable and fun.  

I like that they serve my Moroccan Mint tea in a cast-iron tea kettle.  I like how they cook all the goodies right there in the same space as the customers, and I like that the people who work there match the style of the space.  Wish they did pour overs and pressed coffee, though.  

Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent, although pricey.  My favorite is the slightly odd margarita they make, and it takes about five minutes to create, so be patient, but it's well worth the time.

The new location is much roomier, has more seating, and most importantly more table space! I find this to be a great place to study, meet someone or just relax.

If anyone tells you this isn't a hipster bar, frankly, they're lying. However, I find this rather refreshing compared to the rest of Phoenix which can be quite hum drum. And not every patron is a hipster, however hipsters dominate.

The coffee and pastries are excellent and the staff is friendly and personable. They now have two separate counter areas in the new location, one that serves the coffee and pastries and another that serves the booze and food. Also they are now open until midnight, but only serve coffee until ten... which is excellent in my opinion ^.^

Overall, I love Lux and am happy to have them as neighbors! Wonderful place for me to study (especially with extended hours now) and they are certainly helping with my SF withdrawals, being new to Phoenix and such.

I live close to the location and frequent it with my closest friends.
