You can spend your entire vacation at Caesars Palace and never run out of things to do. Still one of the best resorts in Las Vegas. Caesars Palace offers unlimited entertainment opportunities.

The property consists of Nightclubs, Bars, Lounges, restaurants, shopping, gambling, conventions areas, concerts, shows, and much more. There is a beautiful pool area and there is the Qua Spa. The casino is huge and the staff is very friendly. The suites are amazing and they have nice views of the strip. The Nobu tower is a recent addition to the property.

Everyone should stay here at least once. You will definitely enjoy your stay.",3,3,3

Despite is such old hotel, you won't notice it by the exterior or interior.  They did remarkable job keep the shape and made many improvement.  After all this is the hotel that the blockbuster movie Hangover pick not once but twice of their trilogy.
This is a massive hotel, it will me like a good ten to fifteen minutes to walk pass the entire Caesar Palace just from the street.  This hotel features the currently best buffet in town ""Bacchanal"".   They also added new hotel room called Nobu which a modern hotel room that isn't inspired by Roman Theme.   

Also, forum shop the current biggest shopping outlet in the strip is also located in this hotel.  Technically, you do not need to leave the hotel for most of the act ivies, it got basically little bit of everything.  The location of the hotel is among the best in the strip, next to Bellagio and across Paris.  There is numerous water fountain spare all around the hotel both inside and out.

The most expensive room in Vegas are happened to be in this hotel as well, costing almost 50 grand a night consist of a actual Villa with over 20,00 square feet.  So if you are super high roller or a millionaire.  There is a suite suitable for your statue.  I think their standard room rate is a bit overprice for a Four-class hotel class.  The price is about the same an Aria, which is a Five Star.  Maybe the movie Hangover and Bacchanal really jack up the price, it was not that long this hotel was a bargain since it got no resort fee, but now it does and the rate is also high.  This is a hotel you will likely going to visit many times since it got so much to offer, but as for hotel guest is hard to sell to me unless the price is right.",17,16,16

When we arrived around 9:15 on a Thursday there was no line at the check in desk, we were able to immediately check in, but rooms were not ready.  So, we checked our bags with the bell captain and went in search of a quick breakfast.  The only place we found to get a quick sandwich was Smashburger in the food court.  Everything else was pastries and other assorted carby sweets.  We were given a call around 11:30 to advise our rooms were ready, which was appreciated.

As others note, Caesars is enormous.  It's a Frankenstein's Monster of a hotel, with parts of it being build in the 50s and other parts in the last couple of years.  What tower you stay in is VERY important.  My understanding is the Roman Tower has not been renovated, so you will have a vastly different room if you stay there rather than the Augustus or Octavius Towers.  We had comped rooms, but an upgrade to the Octavius Tower was $50 a night.  The room is large and has a sitting area with a small sectional couch.  The bathroom was very nice with a large jetted tub, double vanity, and a decent shower.  It was smaller than I was expecting.  My room overlooked the pool, which was fine but I imagine the Strip views are much better.

You are going to do a lot of walking at Caesars, so be prepared.  We would leave 15-20 minutes early for meals which is crazy because we ate every meal either in Caesars or the Forum Shops.  It can sometimes take you that long to get places that are in the same building, depending on the time of day.

I could not get my room as cold as I like it.  So, I basically slept above the covers during the duration of my stay.  Also, and I know this is a huge first world problem, the small TV in the bathroom wasn't working.  So, I had to call an engineer to get that repaired.  Again, I know that is not really a problem but it's worth commenting upon because if they are going to put a TV in the bathroom, it ought to work.

Caesars has a very solid list of restaurants between its own restaurants and the Forum Shops.  All of the major Vegas players are here:  decadent steakhouses, Chinese, sushi, Italian, a Gordon Ramsay place.  Also, they've got the best buffet I have ever had:  Bachannal.  Expect a long wait during the weekends.

Regarding the casino, there are really three.  There is the old casino which is near the front desk, then there is the casino near the restaurant area.  There is another casino near the poker room which used to be where the Pussycat Dolls themed dealers were.  They don't open most table games until noon during the week, but on the weekend there was plenty of stuff open during the day.  

The poker room had been remodeled since my last stay.  They run daily tournaments and the only cash games I saw being spread were $1\/$2 and $2\/$5 NL.  Very large sportsbook that is one of the more popular books in town.  Like any sportsbook, you will need to arrive early on major event days (NFL Sundays, triple crown races, NCAA tourney, Super Bowl, etc).

I would consider staying at Caesars again, but I will probably look elsewhere for my next trip.  That being said, it does have a lot of good restaurants, so will definitely be back to the hotel, just maybe not as a guest.",7,1,2

She became even more irritated that we didn't want to pay for an upgrade. We did check in the day before and opt to pay $30 for early check in. The front desk offered this as well since there was no record of our checkin. We again accepted but was told no rooms were available. At least she let us say no at that point because we didn't want to check our bags and pay $30 and risk only getting in the room an hour later. I was pleasantly surprised at check out they didn't charge us anyway. Next we went to the bell hop to check our bags. We waited in line and were told to get in another line for someone standing in front of the desk. With a big sigh and a roll of the eyes our bags were checked. When we did finally get our room my wife wanted a bath after a long trip. The shower head looks like it hadn't been cleaned in years and under the soap holder looked the same but also had some lovely hair accents (see photos). The wall paper in the room was peeling off. So it was off to the pool where they can't seem to figure the music out as two songs were blasting at the same time, very obnoxious. At least we could get a good nights sleep.... Or so we thought. The bed must have been used by a 2 ton person. It had a big dip in the middle and my wife and I would roll into it throughout the night. Friendly tip put a pillow in the middle. To be fair during the four nights we did meet two friendly staffers, the rest seemed irritated. Overall we had a horrible experience and will never go back to this over priced run down and unfriendly hotel. Stay elsewhere.",1,2,2

Very pretty hotel with a comfort level of sameness that has been here for what seems like, ever. We played a few table games here and checked out the poker room which was beautiful but did not play. We did end up playing blackjack in the ""Pussycat Doll Casino"" which is based right outside Pure Nightclub. The music was loud, the atmosphere fun and young and we had a great time. The man ended up leaving +$200 and I was +50.

Last year, my guy stayed here with a group of guys who were in town for a bachelor party. They dined at Bradley Ogden,played poker ( a lot) and really made use of this hotel. The room was just average from what he says, but since I didn't go, I cannot comment.

The clientele here are older and classier than what you may see at the Palms, Cosmopolitan or any of the other Harrahs Caesars properties (Flamingo, Bally's, Harrah's etc.) It's no coincidence the Hangover movie chose to film parts of their movie in this hotel\/casino. One of the drawbacks of this hotel is maybe that the casino floor is too big, and it sometimes may be too big and you can get lost in it if it's your first time there. The casino has an elegant pool as well. 

The casino has awesome Greco-Roman artwork and architecture; patterned to the liking of we studied about Greece and Italy in school or when you go visit those places. Water fountains are also just as elegant. 


One of the best things about Caesars is that it is located in the center of the strip at Flamingo and the Las Vegas Boulevard. Just hop over the sky bridge and you are at Bellagio or Bill's across the street. There is easy access to self parking here if you use the back road of Frank Sinatra Drive and turn into Jay Sarino Ave.  Caesars is also connected to the Caesars Forum shops, the biggest upscale retail in Las Vegas. As for shows, Celine Dion and Elton John have live shows in their big theater and Shania Twain is supposed to come at the end of the year. I also noticed they are building a Nobu Japanese restaurant which should open at the end of the year. 

I enjoyed the customer service from the concierge, casino dealers and even janitors. I highly recommend tourists to browse around this casino if it's their first time, if they do not want to stay here because it is somewhat on the pricer end of the spectrum as, say the Imperial Palace across the street. But definitely a famous hotel and cornerstone on the Las Vegas strip.",4,0,0

Their luggage was on the floor! Imagine people walking into your hotel room and who knows if they take anything.. you'll never be able to find out who it is! So unorganized and dangerous. The people at the front desk upgraded us to another room, but it wasn't even the type of room we originally booked so they upgraded us to a third room. You're on your 3rd strike Caesar!

The view from our window was nice and I did like the bath tub. It was big enough to fit 2 people and it was a jacuzzi, which is very nice and relaxing after you walked all over the strip. The bathroom was a very nice size and very spacious. The sleeping area was clean.

It is located in the middle of the main Vegas strip so you can walk to all the other popular casinos (ie. Bellagio, Paris, etc.).  To be honest, I really didn't stay in my room very long.  Come on, you are in Vegas...no time to sleep.

Tips\/Tricks:

I noticed some ppl having problems with check-in.  You should be checking-in at the airport.  At the airport lobby, there is a Caesars Palace booth and there is no line-ups.  Bang...in 5 minutes you are checked-in.

One of the hot nightclubs in Vegas is Pure.  It is not easy getting in on a Saturday night.  It took us 45 minutes to get in (not bad).  There are three basic lines: girls, VIP, and regular walk-ins off the street.  You have to wait in the VIP line and be prepared to show your hotel room key card.  This card is the secret to get you in (you still have to pay the cover charge which was $30 something).  One more thing...don't forget to SUIT UP.   This is the best nighclub I have ever been to.  It is something to check out.  Yes, bottled water for $8 and a round of drinks for 7 guys will set you back $100 but it was worth it.

Getting tickets to any show in Vegas is possible.  Unless you are a high roller or know a pit boss, you will need to do this.  Go to the casino where the show is playing and line up at the standby line at about 4pm (the earlier the better but that time should be sufficient).  Ask a lot of questions to make sure you are in the right place.  You should be able to purchase tickets at around 6 to 6:30pm depending on the hotel\/casino and showtime.

Topless pool...yea, you heard me.  It is free admission for hotel guest on week days (bring your room key).   The trick is to show up early in the a.m. and get your wrist tagged.  They count how many guys they admit and try and keep an equal ratio so there is no Sausage-Fest.    After you get tagged, you can go have breakfest and show up later in the day to enjoy the view.

I tried out Bobby Flay's restaurant, Mesa Grill on the first night I arrived in Vegas.  Wow...what a way to start off Vegas.  The food and service was excellent.  All the other ppl in my party had fish (which they enjoyed) and I was the only one who ordered the Steak.  Awesome steak....cooked perfect and it had this sauce\/glace which was amazing.  Average price of each entree dish was $40-45.  

I booked this Vegas package through Expedia.com ...removing the flight, I figure that the room cost about $175 per night.   It was decent and I would return to this hotel.",3,0,0

It's a beautiful place, but my biggest problem was, no one knew where the Venus Gardens were! We went here for my friends wedding, and we were directed up and down the the entire resort, no lie. It was cool to actually meet up with some of the other people that were part of the wedding party as well. We thought we were at the right location, until the groom calls and tells us, to go back to the front of the resort as that's where it's taking place. So, minus one star for the people that work here that don't even know where to tell us to go! I do give them a B for the effort. One lady who was nicely dressed, actually walked around with us for a little bit and tried her best to make sure we found our way. 

Well, we finally arrive and it was a beautiful day\/evening for the nuptials to take place. The gathering of friends, family, and seeing the smiles on the faces of the onlookers.

The valet lost\/misplaced my car and it took them over 25 mins. to get it, which made us late to the event that evening, they offered no apologies or refunds (yes, they charged us $18 for that) and just dismissed us by saying that we should use self-parking next time.

We wanted to request a late check out, but quickly found out that to extend our stay by just 2 hours, would cost us another $60, on top of over $1k we paid already.

One thing that my wife hated the most is the fact that instead of replacing the towels in our room the next day, they just picked them up from the floor and put them back on the hanger ... This is just discussing.

Finally, they've tried to charge us for 3-4 mini-bar items which we did not use, but we were able to take those off the bill.

Overall, this is not a 4 star hotel, I'd give it 2 - one for the decor and one for the prime location - everything else is lacking.

We have stayed at several different hotels in Vegas and due to our players card, we always get a suite.  This time, we were in Vegas for our wedding, along with 48 of our family and friends.  First off, we didn't get a suite.  We got a shoe box for a room.  I know that sounds snotty, but for the amount we gamble, it's what we are use to.  We stayed in the Julius Tower (their newest one).  The room looked nice and modern, just small.  Upon check in, they held a $200 deposit for incidentals...no problem.  We were then charged $350 for a room that was supposed to be included in the wedding package we purchased.  Since the first night was part of our wedding package, we technically had to ""check-in"" to the same room for the other 2 nights following.  They then held an additional $200 for incidentals.  On the third morning, my now husband, checked his bank account and they had taken an additional $500 out of his account...no idea why...and charged $26 for the pretzels he had ate from the mini bar.  At this point, he went downstairs to speak with a casino host.  No reasonable explanation given other than ""their system had a glitch"" and they were not able at the time to pull our account up because the system was down.  Awesome!  $1250 taken out of the bank when it should have only been a $200 deposit for the incidentals.  After all was said and done, the charges were reimbursed...and took over a week to get put back into the bank account.  Also note, if you are making a reservation, be absolutely sure to tell them which tower you would like to stay in.  There are 5-6 different ones ranging from super old and dilapidated to brand new.  Our tower was brand new and they were still doing construction that we could hear the entire time.  The elevators to that tower were also sketchy.  We got stuck on one for about 15 minutes.  Fun times!  The topper to all of this...one of our wedding guest was staying in the room right next to ours, and she woke up one night with a random man and woman in her room.  Come to find out, her door did not work and if you just pushed on it, it opened without a key card.  She had to file a police report regarding the incident.

Luckily for us, we stayed at the LINQ the last time we were in Vegas and gambled too much, that their sister Total Rewards company,Caesars, offered us 4 complimentary nights during the Thanksgiving Weekend! They only charge a Resort fee which ended up being around $30 a night, but that is something you just can't beat!
We had rented a car for one day because we were visiting the Grand Canyon the next day, luckily for us my boyfriend is a veteran and we were able to get free parking. Be sure to ask the desk attendant if this is something they can accommodate.
The hotel is connected to the Forum Shops and has several famous chef restaurants located within, as well as a food court. 
We stayed in a junior suite with a Jacuzzi, couch and bidet! Yea that toilet that cleans you with water! I felt super fancy! 
The best part was that we were located on the 18th floor which was on a separate set of elevators that allowed us to get in and out of our floor rather quickly. 

The Casino is centrally located so we were close to the Bellagio and could access other destinations quickly. But it could be said that the hotel is rather large and to get in and out takes quite some time. A smaller location like the LINQ was very easy to get in and out of. 

Caesars casino was not my favorite. It seemed that there were not a lot of themed slot machines available. It also has very low ceilings that make it very smokey. 

Per my boyfriend the blackjack player: The Blackjack tables seem to only have bad rules. At night, if you are playing less than $25 a hand, then you're playing with bad rules. -Whatever that means? He said it was worth noting. 

I really loved our view, the statues, and our comped stay. The employees were very nice and I see just by them why Caesars is viewed so highly!",2,0,2

1) Was there around Thanksgiving this year and the quality of the rooms were as follows:
   a) Carpet corners looked like a cat\/dog has been chewing and naw-ing on them for the last few years.  Bathrooms had wallpaper covering OLDER wallpaper.  Why wouldn't you strip it and just redo it or paint it?  The beds were HORRIBLE....the mattresses clearly were not replaced in YEARS.  The TV -- we now have LCD and what's with the old cabinets?  We had 2 little lamps and one electric socket that wasn't working.

2) When explaining our unhappiness with the room, the front desk asked us ""so what do you want us to do about it?"".  I thought to myself ""you have got to be kidding me....the economy is bad but there are 150+ other hotels to go to and they think their entitled""?  

3) After mulling through 3 managers and raising a stink were we able to get issued a food credit.  Even that took more than 6 hours to get.  Disappointed in overall service, their total rewards program (how they are different ""owners\/operators"" from the hotel that is.  Getting things comped isn't so easy and unless you're famous, their motto seems to be just to STAND IN LINE...sorry guys, but our family had other options and we regret we chose your establishment to stay.

The long and short is this: don't get suckered into paying anything extra for a room that they cannot guarantee for you because you may end up in a worse off room and even asking to change properties won't happen.   

I will never stay here AGAIN and I will stay at the Westin or off the strip before staying here ever again.  I don't care if they offered the rooms for free.  The hotel overall is smoky, dingy in the hallways, and not quick to respond to fixing things.  They will ""get to it when they can"" and that can take up to 1.5 days.

For the prices of these rooms at retail, go stay at Vdara or Cosmopolitan.  Even the Bellagio standard rooms are nicer than this place.",3,3,0

The outside looks cool, it totally can't be missed. The interior feels like it really housed Caesar himself, if he loved slot machines and mall stores.

The accomodations are what this review is for.

The room was clean. But, this was a work-paid-for trip, so the brilliant genius that is the HR lady, booked my room with the most vile and disgusting piece of crap human ever to exist on the face of earth co-worker ever.

I can still give the accomodations a fair review.

But, dude, this guy is just plain stupid. He's home-schooled. He needs pro-active. He wears the same black shirt and jeans in rotation every week. He has dandruff, so the black shirt doesn't help. And he didn't come to Las Vegas for partying or women. 

He researched online, the best arcade.

The best video game arcade.

The best effing video game arcade?!?

Now, I would understand if we were still in elementary school and we were on a field trip. Drugs and alcohol would be out of the question. But this guy is old enough to hand his weiner over to a woman in exchange for cash.

And guess what kind of video game?

Dance Dance Revolution.

Needless to say, he found his arcade. And to add to the vile-ness of this guy, he came home after his DDR Dancing and went straight to bed.

No shower.

If you ever see the people that play Dance Dance Revolution, you'll see that it is, to their defense, pretty active. You'll be sweating. And in Vegas, for sure, you will be perspiring sweat so bad you would need to carry a towel. And he does. But, nope, no shower.

Right to bed, no shower, as my other coworkers\/friends watch in horror while pouring ourselves pre-drinks before we start our night, his ends.

It could have been a horrible experience, but he was awake and out when I was asleep. I was awake and out when he was asleep.

The bathroom was immaculate. Knowing that the roomie didn't shower made my experience all the more awesome.

Our parents warned us that their Thursday check-in experience took 1 1\/2 hours so we knew we were in for a wait.  45 mins later we made it up to the counter where they only had TWO staff members checking people in.  I've never seen this at a Vegas hotel.  

They had us down for a room (afterall we'd made the reservation back in April), but he indicated that it wasn't clean.  He tried for another and that room also needed to be cleaned.  He told us to come back 1 1\/2 hours later to pick up our room keys.  We'd worked a full day, we were looking forward to getting to our room to freshen up before dinner.  That was not to be...

We had dinner at the Augustus Cafe and food was way overpriced.  Our waiter would disappear for 20-30 minutes at a time, which meant that by the time he brought the food out the fries were cold as was the toasted club sandwich.  Felt like I was eating someone's $16 leftovers.  We waited another 30 minutes for him to bring the check.  Gratuity was included so what did he care?  Ridiculous!

We were poolside Saturday, which was great!  We paid $20 a pop for cushioned loungers...a bargain compared to the rest of the seating.  We had a great waitress, Maria, as long as we kept orders coming.  After a few hours, I was ready to head up to the room and she was nowhere to be found.  When we did catch her to close out our tabs, she'd put half of my sister's check onto my tab.  When I pointed this out, she snapped ""This is why it's a problem to have so many credit cards!"" as though it were my fault??  I would be more understanding if she 1) didn't get snappy and 2) didn't ask for our name after each order.  We had to wait another 25 mins before she brought back our corrected tabs.  Again - gratuity was included so why rush?

The room itself was located in the Roman Tower, which is obviously the older, unremodeled section.  The rooms were just so-so and resembled something that I'd expect to find in an off-the-strip motel.  Our toilet wouldn't flush so we had to have an ""engineer"" attend to it daily.  When we called Housekeeping for more towels it took a whopping 2 hours, which we didn't have, so we had to share.  Gross!  The cleaning staff seemed to get the majority of the blame, which doesn't seem fair.

We were fortunately granted late check-out when we called down Sunday morning.  We got to enjoy brunch (delish!) and take our time hanging in the casino.  Unfortunately the message didn't get relayed to our room keys because we were locked out!  I called down to the front desk, they referred me to security who verified that we were granted late check out.  We sat outside our room for 20 minutes, waiting for security to reach us.  He was probably the nicest employee in the entire hotel.  Wished I'd caught his name so I could give him a shout out!  

All in all it was a crummy experience.  I've stayed at many a hotel in Vegas and it's usually so seamless.  I never have to deal with staff and I'm able to enjoy my stay.  I left disappointed with the staff as a whole and will not be returning to Caesar's!",1,1,1

The space had an Art Deco flair. I had a clean room which was very quiet, almost eerily so at times, as I rarely saw anyone else on my floor other than housekeeping.
The space was a tad worn, with tape holding down carpet seams in the hallway, some frayed carpet behind the nightstand, which I saw when trying to plug in my phone charger, and some wearing on the back of bathroom door and vanity, but really overall nice. The TV reception and availability of channels was not great, but I imagine most people are not there for the in-room TV options.
At the conference they had impressive food at the welcome reception, and the desserts at all meals were great. 
During the conference, especially in Pompeii III, there was a lot of ruckus (loud conversations, motorized vehicles) in what I imagine were internal hallways, which made it hard to hear some of the sessions.
I found that Caesar's Palace had an iPhone app, and since there were not a lot of in-room materials detailing amenities on site, I tried using it to find out more about the spa and other options, however when I would put in my room number and name (which were what the room was paid for under) the app would generate an error. I am not sure if it was related to the fact that I was told at check in that my room was not available, and was put in a different room.
I was also given two room key cards, and one of them was never functional. Not a big deal since I was alone, and once I figured it out I made sure I kept the functional one with me.
The location was convenient to the Forum shoppes, the Bellagio, Mon Ami Gabi and more.

Three of my four nights in Vegas were spent out till sunrise and it was wonderful having a plush hotel room to crash in afterwards.

Yes, if you wanna over spend on items you can find cheaper somewhere else. The hotel is nice, but the customer service just sucks. You would think for a Vegas ""world class"" hotel that is celebrating 50 years would pay attention to details. Nope. I had a few simple issues that should have been resolved but every time I talked with someone, they would pass the buck to someone else. Vegas is changing for the worse too. It used to be a fun time. Now it's a bunch of young wanna be's trying to live the ""vegas life"" like they are on some reality show (I actually saw someone pukeing and their friend taking a selfie) AND the prices for everything are out of control. Basics are expensive which is a huge turn off. Also here is a useful tip: use Uber or Lyft. The taxi's continue to rip you off by taking you the long way AND practically try to kidnap you to take you to strip clubs so they can get $100 finders fee.  I just felt the city seemed desperate to suck every penny out of you. Vegas used to do things to keep you there longer but I couldnt wait to get outta there. SF, LA, NY & most major cities have more to offer at a better price. If I need to gamble, I can find other places to stay in Vegas for my next visit.",0,0,0

It's been a while since I've stayed here but it's always been a nice one. Hard to beat Caesar's... It has everything. Several guest towers. Some newer and nicer than others. It has great dining options and in my opinion the best shopping destination still in Las Vegas with the Forum Shops. We were in town for a wedding actually taking place at one of the wedding chapels at Caesars Palace and it turns out, they do that rather well also... Caesars Palace really has it all and they do it well.

My friends had a few rooms in the Augustus Tower at Caesars and I was really impressed. It's one of the newer towers and I see why people choose the Augustus to stay in. The rooms are nice and big with lots of space to walk around. The bathrooms are well appointed and has a separate toilet area enclosed by a door complete with phone.The view, from their rooms at least, was the lake of The Bellagio Hotel across the way and that was a different perspective. It was nice to see the water show from that side for once. But what I think is the cherry on top of staying at the Augustus Tower is that it has its own valet. That is such a luxury and one that's not lost on me as I always have a rental car when in town and I'm aware of the efficiency & ease of valeting at certain hotels. The Augustus Tower valet is a breeze. It's right there. Quick drop off, quick pick up. But I must say the main valet out front at Caesars is also very good despite it being such a huge resort and getting filled up often times. They've always accommodated me when I'm in a rush and need to valet and they are all filled up. I've never been turned away. I appreciate that and never forget it (tip well, of course). They'll remember you and you'll be taken care of during your stay for sure.

I will definitely be staying at Caesars Palace on my future visits to Las Vegas and I for sure have my eyes on the Augustus Tower.",1,0,0

We booked 3 rooms, at the beginning, all three were supposed to be next to each other but because another hotel guest demanded a switch, they moved one of our rooms to the furthest from the other two rooms...

Two rooms in the forum tower: for a luxurious loft-ish room, it only came with one king bed with a giant living room. You can't use the fridge because it's filled with alcohol that they'll charge you for if you remove. The bathroom is nice, as always. The beds are low key uncomfortable. The other room connected to the loft-ish room has two queen beds and a nice bath as well.

The last room is in the octivious tower: which, by the way, is extremely far from the forum towers. We came together as a family but we're seperated by another hotel guests request and they didn't even try to accommodate for us. This room has 2 queen size beds and a nice bath as well. Along with a fridge we can't use. The blankets are thin and I woke up sore every day because of the mattress. But maybe some people will like the bed? I've stayed at almost every hotel on the strip and caesar palace is supposed to be the most luxurious but it doesn't feel like it.

The first time I stayed here, we were upgraded to a presidential suite for free because they gave another hotel guest our room. That room had everything for a family. Two rooms, one with a king and the other with two queens. The kitchen had a sink and a fridge that didn't have an expensive mini bar in it. 

This second experience sucked. Our family was seperated, especially since my grandma is handicap and can't walk far. They didnt accomadate for their mistake. The beds suck and there's no fridge for us to use!

I am sad to report that the experience was no where near what I expected or where it should have been. When we arrived we were told the valet was full. I explained that we were staying at the hotel but the girl simply said sorry and walked away. My boyfriend asked another valet and he was kind enough to take our car after some whining and a few extra dollars in his hand. When we arrived at the desk to check-in we were utterly confused. No ropes, no signs, no lines, NO organization. There were 5 people behind the counter checking others in while a small group of ourselves and other guests stood there looking confused. I finally asked a gentlemen who was standing there in a suit, ""Where do we check in?"" He replied with, ""Oh, you are checking in?"" Uhhhh duh. He then tells us to make two lines for the 5 people- again, confusion. We stand there as several other people are helped that arrived after us. Finally, a woman waves us over. She begins helping us and then two girls walk up to her and she doesn't say anything but stops helping us and helps them. My boyfriend and I were extremely irritated. The woman behind the counter didn't apologize and had the nerved to tell us that she had to help them and that we walked over without her waving us up. She was EXTREMELY rude. The service we were provided was extremely poor and not what I expected for the price of the hotel. In addition, the pool was cracked, old and not clean.

My first time staying at Caesars Palace was quite enjoyable, what little time I spent in the room.

Caesars has a great location, in the middle of the strip, and who can't help but drool and dream in the Forum shops? All of the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, from the bell hops, to the front desk personnel to the cleaning staff. 

My one complaint: our hotel room didn't have hot water late at night\/in the wee hours of the morning.

If I only had a sugar daddy. Or a salary. Or hell, both. Anyway...

Oh sweet mother of God. This hotel rivals Circus Circus as one of my least favorite hotels I've stayed in EVER.
Let us begin.

*If you self park, you will walk forever to get anywhere. They have some kind of drainage or sewage problem, so when you enter you will get a wiff of that. 

*Front desk is soooo damn rude for no reason, and if you want to upgrade rooms they are just ""not available"" ever. If you want an early check in, pay 50 bucks. The resort fee is 30 bucks. It's a rip.

*Avoid avoid, and let me just emphasize AVOID the ""Roman"" tower like the god damn plague. It appears the rooms have not been cleaned or remodeled since this place opened. I would say the room I stayed in in the Roman tower was borderline unacceptable. It made Motel 8 look like the friggin Mariott.

*The whole entire hotel and casino is dated. I'm all for themed hotels, and I embrace the tacky in most situations in life, but this place is just drab and depressing. The casino has minimum blackjack set at $25. Yeah okay, no.

*Anywhere you eat here will be expensive and will taste like shit. Just trust me on this.

*The pool area. Okay, it's cool, I like the different ""pools,"" it's a fun concept. I liked the casino game tables that were in the water too. But like everything else on this hotel property, maintainence is needed. Also, they do not monitor who goes in and out of the pool area. Lots of creepers creepin. Anyone can come in whether they are staying at the hotel or not. Not kidding, I saw a dirty homeless man chilling. What the hell?? Speakin of creepin, I peeked at the seperate ""topless"" pool area that you gotta pay to get into. What I saw were a bunch of men sitting around and a couple of women, none of which were rockin out with their tits out. 
I want to add that I saw many people walking through the pool area in wedding type attire. I think you might have to go through there to get to the chappel or something, which to me, is real freakin weird. I could be wrong, but that's what it looked like. 

I'll admit, from the outside I like how Caesers Palace looks. The statues they have outside the hotel and the fountains look cool, I like them. But, that's all you need to see. At some point in it's prime, probably in the 70's or something, high rollers used to hang out here. Just keep that image with you in your mind and drive on past. This place is not a 5 star hotel, it's far far from it. It's not worth the $$$ to stay on this piece of shit property with all the places you can stay in Vegas.",1,0,0

Around 9am in the morning on August 18th, while we were sleeping, 2+ strangers entered our room with a working key. The strangers saw our things and walked out muttering something about ""someone's already in there"". A few minutes later they enter again and then leave again. About 10 minutes later we get a call from the front desk (her name was Naisha) telling us that somehow our room was marked as checked out - which was alarming considering we haven't even woken up or checked out in any way. So we told her we were indeed still checked in and also requested a late checkout. 

We thought things were okay now... but about 1 hour later, another group of people entered the room with another working key. This made us really upset! We expressed our concerns during checkout but was only offered a verbal apology. I've stayed at many other hotels on the strip before and I must say this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Had we been comped in some way that would at least have made up for it, but we weren't.

I took the upgrade which brings me to $589. The room was nice but very dated. It was supposed to be a suite but was really a bed with a dingy sofa by the window.  I went back to the reception area which is a bit like Grand Central Station and after an hour wait, I was offered another upgrade for an additional $100. I'm not sure if any of the rooms fit the original description of the 650 sq ft luxury room I reserved through Expedia.  In my new room in the ""luxury tower"" the sink was clogged with standing water, the ""spa"" tub was an older throwback model  - which looked scary. There is a television in the bathroom that would not operate manually or by remote, the luxury products in the bathroom included 2 containers of shampoo (partially used), one conditioner, 2 soap bars and a shower cap. There is no lotion, q tips, shower gel, etc. The bed linen is worn, the pillows a bit lopsided, the pillows on the sofa were dirty and the decorative panel which housed the tv - missed a conspicuous knob. ...And then there are the products for sale next to the tv - lol. You can purchase an ""intimacy kit"" which contains two condoms, 2 towelettes, a personal lubricant and breath mints for $28 or you can purchase a coffee kit which includes the supplies for the Keurig machine in the room -Keurig K-cups, stirrers, sugar and non-dairy creamer for $13. Really?  Maybe my expectations are too high but at $689, you would be appalled at this room. I checked out of my suite at the JW Marriott to be on the strip.

But despite that I found the hotel to be rather nice especially since they renovated it a few years back. They have fountains and statues for picture taking opportunities. I also have seen a few hired models who dressed in roman attire to entertain the crowd.

The real highlight of this hotel is their pools. Their pool area is quite large and consists of many smaller pools. It's quite a site from your hotel room. They even have laid out beds surrouding the pool if you won't settle for a lounge chair. Even though they have dozens of different pool I have not been able to locate a jacuzzi. Disappointing! The only thing I found close to a jacuzzi was the size of a kiddie pool and rather low. The water was warm but not hot at all with no jet streams. 

Another big plus is the forum shops. So if the gaming and pools aren't enough you always have the option to shop and eat. The forum shops have a few restaurants but I would come here for dessert to unwind after a good dinner elsewhere. They also house a number of high end stores especially if you are into shoes and handbags. 

Aside from the all the more popular places to play poker like Venetian and Bellagio, Caesers also has a dedicated poker room and it is actually isolated from everything else so you don't have to deal with all that indoor smoking and random odors. Action varies quite a bit depending on when you go. My friend talks about it quite a bit but it to be a little disappointing. 

The rooms are decently sized for the price and if you upgrade from the smallest room you get a rather large hot tub to go with it. 

The buffet met my expectations and in my opinion is definitely in my top 3.

The Good: 
Rooms are very spacious, and very clean. 
The casino and all the shopping in the Forum are wonderful. 
The pool is amazing and so beautiful 
High end restaurants are good inside (The Palm) 
Great nightclub 
Awesome bar's throughout 
Beautiful Greek decor 

The not so good: 
No bathroom doors in the rooms, weird I know, this really bothered my brother in law. No privacy when your doing your thing. 
The front desk took forever and ever, very long wait to check in. 
The staff are just OK, I would expect better service at a place like this. 
One morning my brother in law went down for coffee, the morning they were leaving and got told by four different staff members where to go as it was early, and all the information they gave him was wrong. He had to wait 30 minutes for a cafe to open at 6 am. and was treated very rudely. 

The coffee for a 20 oz. cup was $5, or room service $15. I feel like they really take advantage of people with outrageous prices. 

My hubby was the smart one walked across the street every single morning for me to Burger King, where I got almost three cups for that price. 

The guest parking is a nightmare to find, no signage at all, very confusing. As well as the number of elevators for all the different towers. Yes, it is huge once inside but very hard to find your way around. 

Final note, instead of charging my husband's company credit card they charged our personal credit card after numerous times of discussing this. So we had to expense it and wait for our money. They could not reverse the charge, again not the best Customer Service.

I know a couple of friends who got upgraded to a suite here and since they were staying at the hotel anyway, the whole lot of us had no shame in going to the pool.

The pool is INCREDIBLE. Booze stands everywhere, a cool crisp pool, awesome architecture, and $500.00 cabanas (yes, i asked. no, i didn't get one. do i look like i'm made of money? jeez).

Also, I just like saying 'Snackus Maximus.' I was really hoping they'd have calamari here, but alas, they did not.

Q: Elton John or Celine Dion?
A: Sir Elton, of course. Duh.

Pros: 
- 5 different pools! With a pretty cool and hidden dayclub
- a nice upgrade to the top floor with pool views for only 40 bucks
- Munchbar was delicious and they had areas for watching the Kings game


Cons: 
- not the crowd we were looking for. Mostly older people 
- the casino is lacking some games which we had to go to surrounding hotels for 
- inattentive staff. The iron and MP3 player in our room weren't working so we gave them a call and they said they'll send replacements up. 3 hours later we called again and they said the same thing. Again. We didn't end up getting the replacements for another 2 hours.

It wasn't safe to leave the room like that so we asked for help and the worst customer service experince started.

We talked to a guy named Ryan he said he will send an Engineer to fix in 10 minutes finally a guy showed up about 40 minutes later and he was like I am not a lock smith and can't help. So I called Ryan again for the third time and he gave me an idea to leave someone behind so that person can keep guard and bolt the door the door from inside.

The front desk service was pretty good, not overly enthusiastic, but friendly enough. I checked in at noon, but the room wasn't going to be ready until 3 pm. I had to do a booth setup anyways. None of the lines were really moving all that quickly. If it were a personal trip, I would've self checked in at a kiosk, but didn't have the credit card used to book which I think was a requirement.

They also received a package from my work sent to me and delivered it to the palace ballroom for me. There was even a voicemail to my room before I checked in about it.

I came back at 3 pm, got a couple of keycards. Short line. They drew a map for me to find the right Palace elevators which are in the back by the pool area. It's not the most convenient spot if you want to hit the strip, but again, I wasn't paying for the room. If you have have a chance for a lot of pool time though, it doesn't get much better. No 13th floor officially.

The room had a king sized bed, TV, mini bar, couch, chairs. The bathroom had a stand up shower, a tub with jacuzzi jets, dual sinks and a room for the toilet. The turn down service was good. No complaints.

CP is located pretty well. Right near the Bellagio bridge and you can head across the strip to Bally's side. The heat that weekend was horrible so being well located to so many decent spots was great. The taxi and uber pickup at night was pretty crowded. For airport shuttles, they pick up at a different exit through the casino instead of the lobby, and on the other side of the fountain away from the taxis and limos pickup. They start at 6:30 am.

The first night I checked in, I was placed into a smoking room because (allegedly) they had no non-smoking rooms. The next day, I was DOWNGRADED and moved clear across the enormous  complex to one of the few remaining non-smoking rooms. I tried to bring up the matter with the front desk, but all I got was a shrug and an ""oh well, that's all we have for you."" 
During my stay I had to call the front desk several times for lights, television, and fridge issues. I even had to call once because a man had been passed out in the hallway a few doors down from me... Not necessarily their fault, but I couldn't believe security didn't take care of him before my call, especially considering it could have been a medical emergency!
Throughout my stay, I was met by ever more uncaring staff, including the annoying ""room service"" knocks, despite the fact that I'd placed my ""Do Not Disturb"" notice on the door the night prior.

 So many great restaurants to choose from you could stay here and never go any where else but there are a couple of down sides, Starbucks was always understaffed no matter when we got there, peak breakfast rush one person making drinks and two ringing in orders with a line down the hallway. Central is a great breakfast option, food is good but it depends on your server, your wait could be a while. Payard is over priced poorly made classic french dishes, a total let down.
 We only stayed in house for dinner a couple of nights, Nobu is a DON'T miss, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was good food for a good price and the food court give alots of options but be warned it closes at 11pm. This  is the down side to Caesars, there is very little late night choices for food.
 We only encounter one member of staff on the Casino floor that truly stood out, Steve on the Craps table in the back near Gordon Ramsay's.

Short story:
- Messed up our comps when confirmed they were available
- Dirty band aid in our hotel bathroom
- Broken faucets
- No video roulette
- Housemaid didn't replenish our bathroom toiletries after the first night

Long story:
My boyfriend, a total rewards member was graciously comped 5 free nights plus food comps at any of the Caesar's properties. And without a doubt, Caesar's would be first on our list. When I booked the hotel, I was confirmed that the nights were free and the food comps were available. After a sickening flight, we were told that we did not make reservations under the same code and was not offered other comps as substitution. Disappointed, we went upstairs to check out our hotel room. After a quick tour, I stepped into the bathroom and there it lay. A DIRTY BAND AID. Just there. Laying. On the ground. I was appalled that this institution supposedly reputable and gorgeous had such a disgusting slip up. Furthermore, the faucets were broken. HOW DO YOU HAVE BROKEN FAUCETS THAT YOU DON'T BOTHER TO FIX? Then the cleaning lady didn't even bother to replenish our bathroom toiletries. The whole time at Caesar's was a disappointment. In all, Caesar's is nice on the outside and the casino floor. I wouldn't bother to come back to Caesar's to stay the night though.",2,0,0

The first night I was given a fantastic room upgrade, with my own spacious king-size bed, a view of the pool and a luxurious tub with jets in the Octavius Tower.  That was a 5 star experience.  The final night I stayed in the Forum Tower, which was less enjoyable.  I could hear music and bass from the club throughout the evening.  Not a huge issue for me as that I find pretty enjoyable, but worth noting if you are looking for quiet room.  Also, in the hallway there I encountered a couple drunk sobbing girls during my midnight snack run, nothing too major but I was just hoping for a quick, peaceful trip downstairs.  The pools are expansive and very nice.  Bring some chips down to them with you, as you can play blackjack while you sit in the pool and drink and enjoy the water.

Plenty of restaurants lie within Caesar's Palace and even more sit in the Forum Shops, attached to Caesar's.  My big complaint would be the long lines at check-in and the location of some of the rooms within the hotel.  Also a plus (although I didn't experience it) is that Caesar's has the supposed best buffet in Vegas.",1,0,0

I had to stay there for a conference and hated it. (But let me say up front: I hate Las Vegas, so it would have been hard to please me, and I basically never stay in luxury hotels because I resent their business model of squeezing cash out of their guests at every turn.)

Pros: it's a luxury hotel, so they get all the obvious things right--clean, comfortable rooms, jacuzzi in the room, good bell service, good doorman for hailing a cab.

Cons: like many luxury hotels, they nickel and dime you for things you would get for free at Best Western; to use the gym and internet you have to pay a $29\/day resort fee, but if you use the internet _in_ the gym, there's an additional $10 roaming fee; there's a Keurig coffee maker in the room, but the coffee, cream, and sugar are part of the mini-bar and will cost you $13; it's basically impossible to move around the hotel without walking through the casino (by design,of course); smoking is allowed in the casino, so walking from my room to the gym meant walking through a cloud of smoke; the food in the food court is overpriced (for example, a burger, fries, and fountain soda is about $18). I felt like a rat trapped in a very expensive maze.

And of course the worst downside is that it's in Las Vegas.

If you're still reading, here's one tip: there's a small shop called the Emperor's Essentials, which sells snacks, liquor, cigarettes and knickknacks. The prices there are completely reasonable--pretty much what you'd pay at any convenience store.",3,5,1

The property was insanely busy with people walking through it to get to other parts of the strip, gamble, go to one of the bars or restaurants, or just look around. It all was very nice and clean though which for the level of foot traffic was impressive. 

The pools are for hotel guests only (there is an attendant to check key cards). There are many pools to choose from though they all resemble a Greek style design. The lounge chairs are rather comfortable and do not need to be reserved. The thicker cushioned lounges ($300) and of course the cabanas need to be reserved ahead of time. The Garden of the Gods pool closes at 6p Saturday and the others an hour later which I just can't understand. All in all a very enjoyable complex. 

Room 780 in Romans tower was traditional, but massive! There was a couch and two chairs making up a seating area - albeit around an outdated disappointing in cabinet television. The bathroom was large as well with a toilet and bidet separated into another room. The main door to 780 was behind another door off the hallway. The keycard was required for both doors. Next to the internal door was a door to another room - I am guessing for adjoining purposes.

Since the concert was to be held at Caesars that's where we wanted to make our overnight arrangements. I had called the resort months in advance to assure a nice room\/suite\/whatever with a view of the strip, being able to watch the Fountains at Bellagio from the balcony or window. I received confirmation shortly after.  ""Thank you for choosing The Laurel Collection by Caesars Palace."" (Only upon checking out did I discover that they charged you for calling them to make a reservation...$16.80. What a rip off!)  Great, everything's all set. I am slightly handicapped so more time than the average would be spent sitting, looking at the view from the room's balcony, windows, etc. Later I get this email from them;
""Skip the Line with Self Check-In
Look for an email the morning of your arrival inviting you to check in online. When you arrive, leave your bags at our Bell Desk and start having fun! We'll text or email you when your room is ready so you know when and where to pick up your keys."" (OK, I'll keep my eyes open for this, sounds good.)A few weeks before our December trip I received an email from Caesars mentioning that, ""At times, premium rooms may go unsold. As a special offer, you can use the new Caesars Palace eStandby Upgrade® Program to potentially upgrade this reservation to a premium room."" This sounded interesting so when we arrived (2:00 pm Wednesday) I went for this possible upgrade of only about $100. more per night for a 2 room suite. We were told the suite was not quite ready yet, give us your cell phone number and we'll notify you when it ready.  Well that notification never happened...and neither did the self-check in. It was now after 4:00 pm so we got in line (again) to re-check in and were told the suite was ready.  We went up the Forum Tower to ""room #6419"" only to find that yes it was a two room suite but with almost no view at all.  One of the two windows had been completely covered with a mirror type film so you could only see yourself, the other window looked out to a large concrete wall about 3' away and you would put your face on the windows far left had side you could see daylight!
Looks like we lost the view that we wanted after paying $100. more per night. I was so tired of walking around, trying to find the room\/suite that I really had lost all energy to go back downstairs and demand my original requested room with view of the strip.  This reminded me of a fishing trip once I booked on an old mine-sweeper ship in Canada where the cabin we had was right next to the engine room with no view of anything except yourself. What was worse (after unloading luggage in the suite with no view) no coffee maker unless you were willing to pay $13. to use their Keurig coffee set per use. It was the typical set up where you can't move anything (or use) the small refrigerator unless being charged for it. The lighting was bad even with every light turned on, but the A\/C did work.  The room\/suite itself was ok but nothing special (similar to the Embassy Suites concept) everything seemed rather dated.  The bathroom had a mirror TV in it and a whirlpool tub along with a walk in shower with three showerhead choices; the standard wall unit one would expect, a rainfall shower head from the ceiling and two small side spray massage showerhead nozzles. Luckily the floor we were on and the one above us was relatively quiet at night so we could sleep. We ended up paying $391. per night for their two room suite with one king bed, no view to mention, no refrigerator or working coffee maker unless you paid extra - gee - we could have done better...and we're not going back to this rip off hotel\/motel\/resort that's so large no one cares about the customers.

I left my debit for the deposit on the room...3 days later total was charged on my debit card! What makes this worse is that the room was already paid for so they charged for the room twice.

They had a great deal last Thanksgiving & I scored a 3 night stay at around $80\/night. I always knew this property was HUGE but I didn't think it would bother me so much once I was actually a guest. 

The property of course is beautiful and I'm certain has gained so much popularity since the Hangover Movies (the gift shops even sells Hangover merchandise). We supposedly got a renovated room and it was pretty nice - spacious, clean, and beds were very comfy. The walk down the endless  hallways to the elevator was not fun especially after a tiring night. The crazy maze to get to the parking garage was insane too - like a good 15min walk. It's not that easy to find parking either lol. 

The resort fee we paid was suppose to include internet which was spotty at best. I gave up and just used data on my phone. Every time I passed by the front desk there was ALWAYS a line that I didn't bother waiting in line to try get the internet issue fixed.

We declined the upgrade and then he said maybe one of the rooms being cleaned would be ready in a half hour to an hour. Maybe. They'll call me. We went to a bar in the lobby to cool down and sure enough they called in a half hour to say the room was ready. What I don't understand is why if checkout is at 11am they don't have my room ready by 4pm. It's bad enough you can't check in 'til four but then they try to get you to upgrade to check in on the time they set. How long until check in is at 6, 7, or even 8?

Check in took less then 4 minutes, the spacious hallways led us to our room in the newly renovated Augusta tower with exquisite views of the fountain and Bellagio.

Due to the high volume of visitors to Vegas, always look for hotels constantly revamping and remodeling!

The room was huge and this germaphobe really appreciated the detailed eye from our maid.  The walls were thick and soundproof, we just assumed we were the only guests on that floor (hotel was actually at capacity).

No coffee and no robes provided, was the only odd observation. Starbucks downstairs is the best option.

I haves stayed in Vegas many times and would return here in a heartbeat. Maybe Nobu next time? 

Mesa Grill and the Bacchanel buffet gives you little reason to leave the property.

Loved it!!",0,0,0

Because Caesers employs an operations manager by the name of Martha.

Original review below:


The service has gone really down here. I travel all over and stay in hotels all the time. This is by far the worst hotel experience I've had. I waited in line for 45 minutes and the lady at the front desk said she's leaving for the night and just left me there. She didn't even bother to have someone else help me. More importantly when I was able to check in, they said they didn't have anymore double bed rooms available. I made it specifically clear when I RESERVED my room through Caesers, that I needed two beds. Instead I got a room with ONE bed that was a smoking room that smelled like an ashtray. I was then billed for stuff from the mini bar that I didn't take. When I called to dispute, they said they would investigate and if it's missing I'm on the hook. Wow. I've never been so mistreated at a hotel. I recommend you avoid this place, they don't seem to care about your business.",0,0,0

Poker room and nice rooms to shower in (spent a total of 4 hours in 3 days in it but whatever)

I was here working a trade show at Caesar's. I told them when I checked in and they gave me a room in the same area as the convention. I also happened to slip how VIP I was that Paris gave me a complimentary  upgrade-just to give them a opportunity to level the playing field. They took good care of me giving me a room in the Palace tower. Beautiful new clean rooms, plasma tv, full mini bar, plasma tv(with movie rentals). Very nice

My not so VIP coworker was given a room in the Roman tower. It paled it comparision. If I had stayed in that tower I would not be so happy. I think it's where the ruckus starter are stuck together--kinda like a slum. JK!


The casino also has one of the best poker rooms around. No smoking allowed! Which in my book would make them six stars if I could give them a super special bonus star....

I lived at the poker room, I was the semidelusional chick ranting and raving with a lot of chips (if anybody was there June 29\/30th) I slept about 4 hours total over 3 days so I got weirder every night. But our table was the one laughing the most so I think it was all good.

Among the casinos on the Strip, Caesars is a sprawling behemoth. Filled with shops, absurd statues, and smoke, Caesars offers everything from working girls, dazzling beauties, and Cher to obese couples dressed in matching tee shirts covered with images of dollar bills. The sprawling space has surprisingly few tables, though, even on Friday nights. Very few options for grabbing a quick bite, but the conference rooms and services are excellent. The rooms are minimalist and spacious, with tubs and showers for couples in most rooms, king beds with goose down blankets and pillows, and velvet couches. Comfortable, but not luxurious.",2,1,1

They raised their room service prices but didn't check to make sure they updated all the menus in the rooms. I ordered an omelet for breakfast and what was listed as a BOTTLE of Dr. Pepper. The bottle was actually a 12 ounce can (menu price for the BOTTLE was $6, actual price for the can was $7). The omelet was $3 more than the menu price, and the room service charge was actually $10 when the menu said it was $6. When all was said and done I was overcharged by $10!

They did honor the menu prices, but it look a lot of work and no fewer than 3 phone calls to get them to do it.

I also had a problem with the internet. It wouldn't stay connected. I don't know if they needed to reboot the routers or just get new ones, but it was very frustrating.

Additionally, I don't know where Caesars ranks as far as the total number of hotel rooms, but the the place is absolutely huge with no fewer than 7 towers. Being big isn't inherently bad, but the layout is, especially for a property this large. They gave me a map when I checked in and even with the map I kept getting lost.

Oh yeah, be prepared for a very high resort fee.

I've stayed here at Caesar's once before and had absolutely no issues and that's exactly why I chose to stay here again.

First off I usually book my rooms online and never call to book my reservations but this time I decided to. the first person I spoke with said the room I wanted  was sold out and then gave me prices for the different rooms available. I told her i'd talk it over with my boyfriend & I would call back. Maybe 5 minutes later I speak to a different representative & she stated the information the previous rep gave me was invalid, & to make matters worse the prices I was quoted were had over $100 difference. In short I got the room I wanted at the price I was originally quoted. 

Upon check-in after receiving our room keys we went upstairs and opened the door and there were people's things in the room, so we had to go all the way back downstairs to fix the issue, come to find the lady who checked us in gave us the wrong room number. Then back upstairs we went.

So like I said I've stayed here before & did not understand why OUR room had no door for the bathroom.. I mean I don't really need the privacy with my boyfriend but when it comes to using the restroom particularly #2 a door would have been nice.

THEN, there was a dried blood like stain on the sheets. I mean I haven't had this bad of an experience even in a cheaper hotel or motel.

AND no free Wi-Fi!!! are you kidding me, after a $28 resort fee per night you still can't offer that to your guests!?

I did ask for late check out for all the inconveniences & they still couldn't give me that!

Last thing that I didn't appreciate was that after we had spent $$ at places Caesar's owns the woman who checked us out gave us a coupon book we couldn't even use because we were leaving. Weren't they supposed to hand us that during check in?

However the only thing I enjoyed here was room service. The food was great!

Anyways it's not like I'm never gonna stay at a Caesar's entertainment property every again, but this experience sucked so bad!!",9,3,2

Our room had just been remodeled, and was pretty nice.  Not dingy at all.  Also, we had a TV in the bathroom mirror which was really convenient while we were there on November 3rd, trying to keep up with the presidential election as much as possible while we were partying in Vegas.  

A couple of issues, however.  Apparently, the entire Forum Tower was experiencing some sort of engineering difficulty, and there was a loud noise coming from our door lock throughout the entire stay.  The actual noise it was making is hard to explain; but it was loud enough to wake me up every 15 minutes during the night when it occured.  However, they did comp us the bottle of 2003 Clos du Val Cabernet Sauvignon that was in the mini bar after I called and complained about the mechanical noise.

Another issue:  there is a lack of hotel security in the late hours of the night\/early hours of the morning.  I was walking back to my room alone after leaving my boyfriend to play at one of the blackjack tables for a bit longer, and some sleaze followed me back to the elevators, cornered me and propositioned me like a prostitute, telling me to ""name my price"".  As I frantically looked around for someone, ANYONE, to help me, there was no hotel employees around to assist me, and thank god he didn't follow me into the elevator after I scurried away.  I mean, I acknowledge that sometimes I dress provocatively, but not this time. This guy was just completely out of line, and there was no security guard in the elevator area making sure outsiders couldn't wander up into the hotel or assault the guests.

But, other than that, Caesar's wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  The Forum Shops cant be beat; having Vegas's best shopping right at your fingertips was awesome(and bad at the same time).  And, the Elton John show was outstanding!  Definitely check The Red Piano show out.",5,3,4

We stayed at Caesars in April of 2015 and got the Augustus Tower room. The first annoying thing was that we were promised a ""separate check in area"" for Augustus or Octavius Tower rooms, just to find out that those check in areas have been closed since January 2015. So basically, you're paying for a premium check in experience but you have to stand in line with everyone else at the basic hotel check in. Because of this, there isn't any reason to use the side Valet entrance because there's no bell desk and no special check in. Plus if you exit on this side entrance there's a skeevy half block walk to the Strip that smelled of sewage.

Check in was annoying. Long lines (on an off-season Wednesday morning no less), and they charge you $20 to ""text me when the room is ready"", or a $40 ""early check in fee"". It felt really tacky. We neglected the ""Bellagio Fountain View"" upgrade for another $40 a night so our view was of the north side of the Strip.

Room itself was great. Nice big bathroom with a soaking tub, separate shower, and dual sinks, sitting room with a desk and table and a couch. Flatscreen TV was an unimpressive 30"" model, barely visible from the bed itself. No storage space in the fridge and anything you touch or move in the minibar, you pay for. High speed internet was decent, but also limited in yet another nickel-and-dime tacky way because your $32 resort fee only covers 2 devices per day. So if you have a couple of phones, a laptop, and a tablet, you're out of luck getting them all on the wifi.

Pool was okay, but until 1PM, half the pool area is covered in shadow. Paid $38 for two 16oz from-a-machine slushy alcoholic drinks at the bar, which seemed about $10 too much. Waiter service was very slow, only was visited once during a 3 hour stay. Mattress lounge chairs by the pool rent for $200 a day, $300 on weekends. Cabanas are much more expensive.

Compared to the places like the Venetian, Cosmopolitan, and Aira, the crowd was definitely older, and of a lower.. ""quality"" for lack of a better word. This is not a young and hip crowd and there was a surprisingly large amount of families here with very young kids and babies.

The casino was smaller than I expected, smoky, and a huge step down from the likes of the Venetian, Cosmopolitan, and Aria. The deep smoke smell seemed to be embedded in all the carpets and furniture, reminding me of the old casinos in downtown Vegas. All of the slot machines seemed to be models that were 2 years old or more, with an overall small selection compared to the tons of variety you find elsewhere in newer casinos. Very few of the large modern video machines (ie Willy Wonka, Rolling Stones, etc). Mostly slot machines were the J\/Q\/K\/A variations of the GameKing video slot machines. Plus the place was packed - there were times in the evening where you couldn't find a table to play at. I found myself wandering endlessly around the casino looking for anything interesting to play. In the end, I did most of my gambling elsewhere.

I would stay here again if I could get the upgraded Augustus or Octavius tower rooms for less than $140 a night. Otherwise, the overall Caesar's experience just isn't worth paying more than that.",3,2,2

Then we requested rooms customer service was absolutely ridiculous and rude and I had to beg to be switched. When we finally get switched this room smells too! Invest in some febreeze Caesar! And multiple of the electronics didn't work. Then they sent someone to fix it who made us leave our room for two hours! I'm not a picky person but seriously! Then no upgrades or anything of any kind. I am very disappointed and it is unfortunate because I am in Vegas very often. I will not be returning.",4,1,1

Yes. ..the palace tower room we had was gorgeous perfect sleep comfy mattress you never want to leave 4 pillows plus neck rolls. .bidet 2 bathrooms  great tv big hot tub right there.next to the sink.extra big towels.new looking.But that's why I gave it t hat third star. Maybe some rooms are older and we got lucky. But as good as it was, I hate bad service,and although some employees were perfect some of the ones I encountered were just rude. 

No offer to help us find the room or assist with bags...a map was given. It's a huge property. I had to stop twice to rest. Shop employees hawking, trying to drag me inside like at a flea market.

 No inroom coffee pot.you have to pay almost thirteen dollars for a coffee set up.which consists of mostly various fake sugars.not enough fake cream and real sugar for one good cup. No cookie no breakfast discount or sweet roll.. didn't like the apple scented shampoo..sorry.

We got there about 8pm. No option to check out later even paying extra.11 a.m.is too early in that town. 

I could go on,but I will review the restaurants separately. Basically overpriced mixed service average food. 

Hugo the valet,adam the steakhouse waiter and his assistants, Debra the phone operator,Summer the cage cashier Almira the casino club cashier, all deserve praise. But I'm always nice,polite,smiling,  and I encountered way too many snippy dismissive employees for such a reputable establishment. 

The only way I would return would be getting a great price to cover all the lack of reasonably priced amenities.  Hopefully the bill will be correct.they added a two hundred dollar amenity charge even though we didn't touch the minibar or purchase inroom food or movies.

Try to plan ahead carefully. Best of luck to you.",4,0,0

The only negative is the room we were given. We we're in Roman Tower which is the oldest and you can tell. Even in a suite room we had carpet that was stained and about 20 years old. The furniture was a mix of the last 3 decades and the mattress was worn out and springy. It definitely needs some updating for being a top tier Vegas resort.

This place is still happening, and it's still beautiful, it continues to grow by leaps and bounds (I always see new things here everytime we come to Vegas) and it simply never disappoints.  The Forum Shops alone keep this place going, but this hotel continually boasts great entertainment, great dining, great hotel amenities (from what I hear), and whatever else tickles your fancy.  

What I love is that they were the first hotel to have a buffet....... their ""Sunday Brunch.""  I cannot tell you how special it was, and how much my family and I would create an entire trip around making sure we got to have Caesar's Palace Sunday Brunch.  Now?  Buffets are everywhere at almost every hotel, and not just on Sundays, and as for the famous Caesar's brunch, they have now downplayed and minimized the once great and amazing brunch.  That part makes me a little sad, but the memory of what it represented to us still lingers on in my mind and makes me smile.  It also dates me a little.  : )     Some of you know, though, what that brunch was all about !!

I've always had a pleasant experience staying at Caesar's; although, I can't say the same about losing money while gambling here. You can't miss this massive property right off the Flamingo exit of the I-15.

Somehow, I always end up in the Palace Tower room. That's the room with the exhibitionist shower in between the two bathrooms. You'd think having two bathrooms is convenient until one person is taking a shower but has to lock both doors since the shower doors are glass. If you don't care, shower away and display what yo mama gave you. The dual showerheads make it fun to shower with a friend while doing the earth a favor by conserving water.

The furniture is modern and the rooms are upkept nicely. The beds are comfy I have no complaints. My last trip was with three guys and of course they forgot to pack some toiletries. They had someone bring up toothbrushes, shaving cream and razors, extra shampoo and conditioner, and soap. They even brought up extra robes and slippers.

We pulled an all nighter and I finally got to bed around 10am. We were all feeling lazy later on and they brought back dinner from the food court. Their food court actually has good food unlike food courts from other hotels.

Upon arrival we ordered room service to be delivered during normal hours and we were told it would take additional time to be delivered since we ordered during peak hours, we acknowledged but problem is our meals never arrived at all. Front desk apologizes but we were still billed!

We had ordered additional towels and soap for our room, none provided.

We had requested a wake up call, never called.

We were told to make reservations to get seats at a restaurant, when we arrived we waited over an hour because they had overbooked and could not accommodate us. 

Lastly, after scrambling to check out in time and not miss our flight, one of the bell service personnel misplaces our bag. He told us he would look into it immediately but at the time we didn't want to miss our flights we had to leave. 

Not sure what else we needed to do to make sure our requests could be honored, the most disappointing part was that we were charged for things we didn't not even enjoy and lost our luggage without a follow up call.

Don't get me wrong, the place looks beautiful and the rooms were actually quite spacious and clean, but the reason for the bad reviews are mainly from the HORRRRRRIBLE customer service. Here's what happened to us on our 4-night stay:

1) We booked 2 rooms, one with just 1 bed and another with 2 beds. We show up at 11am to at least reserve our rooms and check in early. When we actually show up and get to our rooms, we get both rooms with just 1 bed. After going back dwon to the desk to get the CORRECT room, they tell us they are sold out and cannot fill our request...NO...NOT A REQUEST...OUR ORIGINAL RESERVATION!!!! Then they tell us we can call in the morning so that they can switch us into a room that has two beds...AND EVEN THEN THEY COULDN'T FULFILL OUR FRICKIN RESERVATION!! They had to bring us a roll-away bed for the remaining nights. ALREADY -1 STAR!!

2) Now, every hotel has valet...BUT I HAVE NEVER...I MEAN NEVER....been denied access to valet when I was a guest at the hotel. That, in my opinion...is UNHEARD OF. They told us that we could use the Colloseum valet, but that would mean we would have to walk all the way around the hotel to get to our room in the Augustus Tower...not worth it. MINUS 1 1\/2 STARS!!

3) Now I know I shouldn't be too much of a big deal, but when I went to the Players Card services area to reprint my card, the lady went all POWER TRIP on me and actually told me, in a VERY HORRIBLE ATTITUDE, that I should not be so careless and not have it near any other credit cards or a cell phone. I mean really, how are you supposed to carry around those cards and not have them near items you carry everyday. Minus 1\/2 star!

4) THEY DIDN'T CLEAN OUR ROOM ONE DAY!! I mean ok, we did leave our room at 2pm, but when we left, the carts were still out there and there was definitely no ""do not disturb"" sign left on the door. -1 another star.

Unfortunately, if you get the room that has no heat and non-working mini-bar, you probably will want to go elsewhere. Caesar's staff handled our issues ok, but not great. I had to call repeatedly to say ""hey, I want to pay exorbitant prices for bottle water and beer, but the fridge is warm. Please send someone up!""

If you say don't know or just say ""the fastest route"", the driver is most likely going to take you on the freeway, which will run you about $33 compared to about $16 the other way.  This happened to me, but I didn't know I was being hosed until the Concierge at Caesar's gave me instructions for the ride back to the airport.  Pretty shady, but so glad the hotel gave me a heads up for the return.

It's hard for me to give a thorough review because I'm not a gambler and hate casinos, but was here for a conference.  Last time I was in Vegas, I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, which is not a fair comparison (although Caesar's charges as much for some of the rooms).

I was upgraded to the Octavius tower, which is the newest tower and I guess the nicest rooms unless you're in a suite.  The room was very nice and comfortable. Loved the color scheme.  But they got cheap in weird places, so it falls short of being luxurious (although some wouldn't know; I'm just old & sober enough to know & care).  For example, there's a TV in the bathroom, but it's tiny, not HD, has only 11 channels (compared to the large HD TV in the bedroom with 30+ channels), and there's no remote so you can't control it from the jacuzzi tub...why bother to have the TV?  It's almost worthless.  Also, no in-room coffee unless you pay for the pods, which most hotels give you for free (there was comp coffee in the Augustus tower lobby area in the mornings, though).  No bath salts available for the tub (even checked the gift shop)--do not use the shower gel because once those jets get going, you'll be overrun by suds (LOL).  And the maid didn't leave a new supply of toiletries on my 2nd day (which would've been ok except that I had 2 shower gels & no shampoo on day 1, so was hoping to have that corrected on day 2).

On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable and the casino offers good restaurants.  The food during the conference was very good, too (breakfast, lunch, appetizers).  Staff is very friendly, courteous, and helpful--great service.

I just wish the ventilation system was more advanced.  The newest casinos like Cosmopolitan and Aria have such great ventilation that the cigarette smoke really isn't a problem, but at Caesar's it hits you the second you walk in.

Summary:  I'd stay again if for business travel or I got a discounted room or something.  Even if staying elsewhere, I'd come here for some of the restaurants or shows (or shopping, of course--can't beat having the Forum Shops there).  If paying full price and didn't have business bringing me here, I'd opt for Vdara or Cosmopolitan or Mandarin Oriental personally (MO & Vdara are non-gaming).

But again, remember that I don't like casinos and going to Vegas is not my idea of  a great time...this was all about business for me.",5,1,1

The rooms in the forum tower were probably one of the nicest we've stayed in; comparable to palazzo, of course much smaller, but comparable nonetheless.  The beds were comfy, decor chic, bathroom spectacular with a built-in flat screen in the bathroom mirror.  The property is beautiful and the service was good.  Valet was also extraordinarily fast.  We saw Celine and it was one of our favorite Vegas shows; truly amazing and worth every cent.  The gambling was good: lots of $25 tables and some $15 during the weekdays.  The downsides: we arrived at 8:30 and asked what time we could get a room and they told us to check back at 11. When we went back the lady told us check-in can be as late as 6 p.m.  We ended up getting a room closer to 2 p.m. which is earlier than the usual 3 p.m. check-in so we weren't too upset but we wished we could have gotten a room earlier and have at the palazzo, encore and ph.   The other thing, we left the do not disturb sign on but the housekeepers still entered and cleaned the room while we were out on 2 occasions; it was a bit weird.  Despite the minor pitfalls, we will be back.",0,0,1

You'll pay a little more to stay here, but the location is a great place to be, IN THE CENTER OF THE STRIP! Paid about $300 for my room and we were in the Palace Towers. Gorgeous room with a long hallway, two queen beds, great view of the pool and huge jet tub with a large shower. PROBLEM: We got home late around 3:00 AM and were looking forward to HOT showers. My two friends took LUKEWARM SHOWERS. They felt bad telling me since I paid for the room. I feel that this is unacceptable since a good amount of money was spent on the room. A guy did come up and service the shower, but it added another 15 to 20 minutes of getting the water hot enough to have another person take a shower. We couldn't shower until like 4:00 AM. Less time to sleep and on the last night of Vegas before a long drive home. Not happy about that. I feel like they should take off my resort fee or something. I did complain, but will see if they honor and value customers. 

The pool was PHENOMENAL! I would recommend any person in Vegas to go check out the pools! 32 oz cocktail is $27. Drinks are expensive, but I was on a vacation so I paid the price for the drink. I would recommend a margarita, mojito or some of their other blended drinks. The pina colada was a bit too sweet. Ice tea is about $9.00. You cannot bring food or drinks from outside. 

There is a poolside area that allows guests to play in the pool. Looked super cool! I hope that I can stay there in the future with no shower or hot water issues.",0,0,0

We arrived at Caesars around 11ish and the main valet is full (only for hotel guests). We waited only about 3 mins until a nice Valet guy comes and takes our car. For Nobu guests you can use the main Valet entrance at Caesars palace. Since we've stayed at Caesars many times we knew exactly where to go to find the Nobu hotel.

Caesars really did a great job decorating the hotel for their 50th anniversary. We took a ton of photos and the best part was the party with Gordon Ramsey!

So we get ready for the party and ask around and guests will need a white wrist band to enter the pool party. There was a little confusion on where to get the wrist bands at first but we got ours near the buffet.

We enter the party around 8:30 and the place is already hopping! Free Champagne everywhere and more photo ops. The live music was awesome and so was the venue!
They had models in the pool and free cake and various drinks as well. All guests was given a free drink ticket as well. Since we were drinking all night, we went high end with bottled water-lol

We ended up squeezing in near the stage in the pool. We got near front seats to see the man Gordon Ramsey and he was awesome! The fireworks were simply amazing. Looks like nothing was spared at this event!

The next day we ended up eating at Gordon Ramsay's (6th time) and they did not disappoint.
We also ate at the buffet - awesome as usual - no wait.

We will back to, this is our favorite hotel in Las Vegas! Keep up the good work!!!",1,1,2

Well as soon as we arrived and asked for the bar for a cocktail we were directed to the other side of the lounge to an older woman who was the cocktail for the bartender. Initially was friendly and asked us for our drink order. She returned with the total and when we informed her we were paying separately as we didn't request 1 check nor were we asked... She told us she couldn't split the check, she took my friends card and after a short debate of requesting separate checks she proceeded to throw the card down on the table in between my friend and I. Unhappily she split the check in moments and we paid and left to find the manager... Apologetically the manager resolved the matter... Don't recommend going to her for any assistance if she is still working there which it is my belief she may be too old and unhappy for the environment.

From the outside, the place looks incredible and made me feel like I just had to stay here.  I'm not impressed.  Maybe if I got to check in at their VIP side entrance on the other side of the Hotel, and was whisked away to my room in style then I might sing a different tune.  But I'm not that lucky.  I'm a standard room kind of guy.  Some of the rooms are HUGE for a standard.  Some are not.  Some are nice, and some are just skankie.  Oh sorry... sqankee.  Our small room had a whore house red velvet sofa.  I didn't want my kids sitting on it, nor did I want to walk around the room without shoes.

One night I walked out of the Elevator and around the corner,  there were 3 guy who looked like gang members hanging out against the wall.  1 was standing, the other 2 were squatting and they stopped whispering and just watched me walk to the room.  They weren't doing anything wrong, but I didn't like the feeling.  Another time, I heard commotion in the Hall.  Security and Hotel staff were kicking somebody out of their room.  Nice.  Then at 2:30am I heard Janella and Toeshawnda fighting in the hall with all her girlz about their man and how one was going to jack the other girls grill up if she didn't stop flappin her jaw in her face. I couldn't tell which one of the 4 was the most pissed because they were all pissed.  Girlz night out gone bad.  I wanted to go out and tell them to SHUT UP, but I knew I'd get my ass beat if I opened the door.

The pool was another disappointment.  It LOOKS great.  But they don't really monitor who goes in, so its filled with people who are not staying at the Hotel.  

The place is a labyrinth.  I hate that.  It's like being in LA.  Everything takes 20 minutes.  From your car to your room, 20 minutes.  From your room to the pool, 20 minutes.  Walking around the pool to find a place to sit, 10 minutes.  Pool to room, 15 minutes.  Room to Buffet, 20 minutes.  Wait for table, 45 minutes.  Dining, 2 hours. Buffet to Bellagio (next door), 20 minutes.  Casino to your car in parking structure and trying to get out on any surface street, 15 minutes.

We were staying in the Laurel Collection and I'd gotten an email to check in before we arrived which we decided to do.

The $30 kind of irked me but we got an email at 1 PM saying it was ready so it was worth having the notification. However when we arrived the kiosk said the room wasn't ready.

The room was very large for what I've stayed in while visiting Vegas and the view was spectacular. We could see the fountain show at the Bellagio and down the strip since we were in the Augustus tower. This tower is also right next to the lobby so you won't have to walk very far. I had some little issues with the room like the fact there were no bath robes, one of the sconces in the bathroom didn't have its shade so it was just a light bulb, the internet connection was super slow on my data plan and wifi, and the shower doors didn't keep water in the shower when fully closed which made the bathroom extremely slippery.

I hand her my US Passcard and it's obvious she has absolutely NO idea what she's looking at, she hands it over to the guy next to her who's stacking the chips and he too has no idea what he's looking at, at which point they hand it to the female pit boss who (guess what?) has NO IDEA what she's looking at and they start giving me a hard time about it. 
It was the day before my 30th birthday. Yes, THIRTY! 3-0. 
Thanks for ruining my birthday Caesar's Palace with your incompetent staff who were practically on the verge of tossing me out of the casino if i didn't conveniently have my passport on hand. 

it's absolutely ridiculous having two female chinese immigrants harassing me about my United States passcard whilst IN THE UNITED STATES. 
what kind of absurdity is THAT?!
And then they have the nerve to tell me that it would've been better had i shown them my driver's license. 
so you're telling me that you know what all 50 driver's licenses look like and what all 200 country passports look like BUT you have no clue what a United States passcard looks like when you work and live in the United States?!

You need to better train your employees on their manners and what government issued IDs look like. You are lucky yelp requires a 1 star minimum because honestly, you deserve ZERO STARS!",4,1,2

Checking in: Was pretty easy, the hostess was making small talk on what our plans were and if we were going to see and shows.  I said that we were looking for good places to eat and she suggested places that weren't at the hotel.  She suggested we try Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan which was weird because Bacchanal is a better buffet.

So they gave us a room in the Roman Tower on the 13th floor.  We get up to our room and open the door and BAM...disappointment.  The room looked old.  The carpet looked like it had been there since day one.  There were even a few parts where it looked like the carpet was coming apart.  In the bathroom it looked like the sink and mirror had been updated but that's about it.  The shower was just a tub with white tile which was pretty much the same as a Motel 6 shower along with the crusty old shower curtain, which looked like it had a blood stain\/makeup stain on it.  Around the room there were tables which were covered by a cloth.  Looking under the cloth they weren't really tables, it  was a few pieces of wood with a circular board on top to make it look like a table.  The TV was also weird, whenever you would turn on the TV the volume would always be at 30 or something which was Club Scene loud and I'd have to turn it down every single time.  

Overall:  What the hell Caesars....I could get the same room for 2\/3's the price at Excalibur.  I thought I'd save $100-150 on hotel and stay at Caesars instead of the Aria or Vdara but I really regret my decision.  Oh well, you win some you lose some.",2,2,1

We finally arrived in Vegas around 6 pm on a Friday, and I was a bit worried they wouldn't have open upgrades available.  Slipped a 20 sandy over and the nice gentleman at the front desk gave us a great complementary upgrade.  Our whole stay there was very pleasant, and all the workers were more than accommodating: spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi and his\/her sinks, a vanity table with good lighting, lots of closet space. Caesars has a great location for clubbing, and it's really cheap to taxi to all the good clubs.

for the most part, we enjoy our stay. certain towers have better rooms - so the augustus tower is the best one - altho they have nice upgraded rooms at the other towers as well. they are also scheduled to open a new tower soon and upgrade the rest. 

the pools have been revamped - so there are more pool areas to lounge around. i have only seen this a couple of times, but they do have 'goddesses' passing out frozen grapes. 

for gaming, they are more on the $$$ side, so if you are not looking to play big in terms of table games, you may want to visit a different casino. otherwise, the dealers are nice enough. it can definitely get crowded on weekend evenings. 

for food - they don't have the best assortment. the high end restaurants usually have great reviews but the buffet, cafe and other offerings are a bit sad. i do like payards (see my review) for quick sandwiches to go and pastries. the food court is so-so but a better option than some of the restaurants. serendipity is not bad.

CONS:
1.  Very bad time with the front desk getting our room.  First they gave us a smoking room when we specifically told them non-smoking (it was also listed in the reservation).  Took them over three hours - from 10pm at night to 1:30 am before they got us in the right room - this was after numerous calls and going back and forth to the front desk about this.
2.  They are not sympathetic at all - their attitude is pretty bad - each time we went back to the front desk they kept saying it would only be 15 mins, then 20 mins, then 30 mins - and each time they kept repeating that they don't guarantee room types only a room reservation.  When you are exhausted from a full work day and have just flown in - all you want is to just settle in your room - not have to wait 3 and 1\/2 hours til after midnight to check into your room.   When I escalated my concerns to the manager - even he was very unsympathetic and kept putting it back on us saying they don't guarantee anything.  Jeez.  Horrible customer service. You make the consumer feel bad, thanks a lot.
3.  They neglect to mention on their site that only some of the pools are available and that there is ongoing construction.  So instead of getting the peace and quite you would think in the serene Garden of the Gods pools - you get a lot of raucous construction and beeping noises for ambience.  Lovely.  And to think that I specifically chose this hotel just for the pools.  
4.  Ceasar's is the only casino that doesn't have clear marked paths for children to stay on when going through the casino - they seem to purposely make you go out of your way to wander every which way until you get to your destination.   If I were an auditor with the gaming commission, I would certainly look into this and ding them for it - it doesn't help with keeping the under 21 off the gambling areas.

PROS:
1.  To be fair - I think because they could see I wouldn't stop complaining until someone did something, they did credit me a $50 food and beverage credit - although, we realized the very next morning that was barely a blip - two crepes later and one coffee and that was that for the food credit! Not even enough for a $2.50 banana or a $3.50 small water.
2.  Beautiful casino and forum shops - especially with the recent renovation, it certainly impresses.
3.  Room was very nice if on the small side - even for the Palace Tower - which is one of the nicer towers.  I don't know why - but when we mistakenly got placed into a smoking room - the room was much much bigger than the non-smoking.   

NEUTRAL:
EVERYTHING is way way overpriced - like I said $3.50 for a small water.  But then again that's what every other hotel would charge anyway.

Would I come back?  Nah.  Overriding everything is the horrid customer service leaving a bad taste in your mouth.   There are other hotels you can spend your hard earned money on with the exact same amenities or even better.",0,0,0

Caesar's may not have the best bars\/lounges on the strip, but the seating is comfortable and they are fairly private.  While I prefer the people watching at Cosmopolitan or Aria, the laid back feel of Caesar's is very much welcomed before or after a night on the town.

Stay away from the MunchBar, the food isn't good and it isn't priced well either.  Pure is a decent spot.  The patio is huge but there isn't anywhere to sit if you're not popping bottles.  The buffet was still under construction during my stay, but it's supposedly going to be the biggest in LV once it does open.

My room in the Augustus Tower was great (4284).  Perfect view of the strip and I could watch the water show at the Bellagio unimpeded.  There's even a separate entrance and registration desk for the Augustus Tower that can be accessed on Flamingo.

The bathroom came equipped with a water closet, television, dual vanities, separate shower, and whirlpool tub.  However, the television in the room was a bit small, 32 in. if I had to guess.  WiFi was not free and cost $14.99\/day.  I thought that was kind of lame considering all of the amenities included.

I called as soon as I booked and informed front desk that I need two beds as I have no desire to sleep too close to the person I was to share the room with. Upon checking in I was told that the hotel had a convention and were full so I only get to have one king bed and they will bring in another temporary bed to my room. I wasn't happy with that arrangement but arguing wasn't going to do any good. In addition the guy who checked me in (I believe his name was Orion or Orien) said that he will compensate with a nice view. As I entered my room in the Roman Tower I realized that he was a major liar as we were put in the 3rd floor and all I saw was the air conditioner on the roof. I also realized that he put us in a room without a bathroom door which is marvelous when you are traveling with a colleague. Then the extra bed arrived and it looked like a military cot. Since I pulled the shorter straw, the cot was all mine.  The entire night our super old toilet made noises as if a bird was trapped inside and the pipes reminded me of a 747 landing on your roof. I could hear our next door neighbor zipping and unzipping his luggage so that tells you how thick the walls are. My cot was hard as a board and i couldnt wait for the sun to come up.  When I spoke to Savannah in guest service she refuse to do anything about any of my problems and told me to call back the next day and talk to Charles. The next morning no one knew who Charles was but after an hour of discussion with the front desk we were moved to another even older room without a view but with two beds and a bathroom door. 
I am not sure where the lack of customer service comes from as I have never experienced such disregard for patrons from another Vegas hotel. This place is old and overpriced and one coffee and oatmeal cost me 20 dollars. The only nice people at this hotel were the valet and bellhop.

Booked for 2 nights and found they actually charged my card 3 months before the stay for one of the nights. I couldn't expense it so far in advance of the event, so I had to pay for it out of pocket until I could file expenses after the trip.

I reserved a King room. Received an email at 3:30am (which I didn't see until I was at the airport) and couldn't use their ""process"" for checkin on my phone. Got to the hotel at 8:30 in the morning, waited in line for 20 minutes in a lobby choking with smoke (I have asthma). I handed the person at the ""check-in desk"" my Amex and she said ""And what do you want me to do with this?"" No Hello, no welcome to Caesars.  I said, ""Well, I'm checking in"" and they then informed me that checkin was at 3pm (which the email did clearly state) and they would notify me via call when the room was ready. I asked if wifi was available and she said its $25 in the lobby area or $14 in the room for 1 device only.

 Went back to the lobby at 3 and waited in line again for 25 minutes (lobby reeks of smoke) and they said they had no rooms ready and might not until 6:00 pm. I said, ""Your email said checkin is at 3 and I have a conference call at 4."" No apology, no offer of help. Finally got a call the room was ready at 4pm, had to stand in the key line again for 25 minutes. Got keys, went to get luggage at Bell stand, they said I had to go outside to the Valet to get my luggage. Gave the valet the ticket and had to wait 20 minutes in the heat for my luggage.

Got to the room and despite the fact that  I paid for a king and booked months in advance, got a queen\/double and handicapped with no tub. Called the front desk and they told me they would give me the king I paid for, but I""d have to go back to the front desk (from the Palace tower) with my luggage and get the keys myself (and wait in the key line... ) for another 20 minutes. Wasn't worth the asthma attack.

Decided to write this YELP and found out the wifi is only 1.5Mbps and ""included in the resort fee"" which is NOT what the front desk told me. 

It seems all of the staff I spoke to were angry and put-out that you are even bothering them. There clearly aren't enough staff as everwhere you go, you stand in line.

I notified the conference organizers of this horrible and rude service and they documented it all. Also called my large tech company travel center and they told me that they removed Caesar's from their approved travel list due to all of the complaints and the non-standard billing process.

I would HIGHLY recommend not having an event at this hotel or staying here. The place needs a lot of work to bring it up to 2015 standards for a $300 a night hotel.",7,3,1

I found Keurig cups for the coffee maker, cream and stevia across the street at the CVS in front of Bally's. I can use the coffee maker and keep my cream in the ice bucket. The pool is salt water which feels smoother and more buoyant. Everything here is a long walk, but the staff have been pleasant even cheerful when dealing with my complaints. It turns out that the phone works, but is complicated. Also, the maid accidentally kept my keycard when she and the other man checked my phones. I had to have the first set deactivated. The staff issued new room cards and delivered them to the room. Caesar's staff handling of my issues moves it from 2 stars to 4 !

I just checked out of the Luxor and moved to Caesars. I paid to upgrade my room. The bed appears to be nice, and the upgrade added a jacuzzi tub. 

However, there are some flaws. None of the phones in the suite work, and I had to get housekeeping to give me the number to dial down to the desk for repairs. There are snacks on one of those weighted trays that charge $25 if you even bump anything. There is a kuerig in my room, $13 for one coffee setup. The only refrigerator is fully stocked with drinks and liquor at stupid prices with a warning that you will be charges if you move anything. So any comfort in the room is offset with stress, ""DON'T BUMP THE SNACKS OR THE HOTEL WILL SCAM YOU!"" If we want a refrigerator that we can actually use, we have to request and pay for one. 

Now folks, I don't gamble. I come with my husband to his conventions and I pay for my upgrades. This is the only real vacation that I get that does not include work or housework. I get some quiet time and read some books. I really do not want to go 60 floors down and walk a mile to pay $7 for a cup of coffee when I was told that my ""UPGRADE"" included a refrigerator (not) and a coffee pot (not). 
I don't trash the room. I tip the staff. I pay good prices for meals and buy at the shops. I am straightforward and don't appreciate these rip off spots in my room. For this crap, they get only two stars for the bed and jacuzzi. Don't play games with me even if we are in Vegas. The west wing king suite upgrade at the Luxor included three rooms, a coffee pot with Wolfgang Puck reserve coffee, a real wet bar with a real refrigerator, and no rip off snack\/drink charges. I gave the Luxor 5 stars.

We will be here four days. I will rate it again when I leave in an attempt to be fair. Right I am ticked off because I moved to a room costing twice as much with less than half the amenities. I loathe rip off spots in a room.",4,0,1

We were only staying 1 night so we weren't too worried about staying somewhere super posh, but wanted to make sure we were in a decent room. 

We arrived in Vegas and were uber tired from our flight. Got the the hotel to check in and were advised that they gave us a free room upgrade. Sweet! 

There was construction and our room was almost close to impossible to find, but with the help of a friendly housekeeper, we were pointed in the right direction. We got into our room and wa wa we wa, it was so nice. There was a large king bed, a lounge sofa, flat screen TV in the room and a TV in the bathroom mirror. 

The whole room and bathroom were really spacious and clean. I have had bad experiences staying at other casinos that you would expect to be somewhat decent and end up getting a S*!% hole for a room. 

The fact that the casino itself is clean and not a smoky as other casinos was a plus. The Forum shops are also nice to walk around for an hour or two.

While I absolutely loved the room and has been the best at I stayed in Vegas the maid service was very poor. Not in that they didn't clean the room, they cleaned it everyday and did a good job making sure everything was refilled and cleaned. But when I was changing in the room the maid knocked on the door and before I could do anything and popped her head in and asked if any one was in. When I said yes and was busy she let her self in walked right into the room. Now I was on the bed half dressed and told her I was busy so I don't know why she walked in and stood right in front of the bed while Im half naked. All she did was asked if I wanted and any towels and said she would be back later to clean.

Besides craps, Caesars has an array of shops, restaurants, cigar lounges, bars, entertainment and shows.

It's probably one of the most massive in size, has a wide range of rooms available in many different towers (all designed uniquely), lots of dining and bar options, and the pool area is amazing. Caesars is right in the middle of all of the action on the Las Vegas Strip so walking anywhere for a change in scenery is easy. 

My husband and I love it so much here that we decided to return to Vegas and get married here. We stayed in the Augustus Tower on our first stay together in December 2011, the Roman Tower on our wedding recon trip in October 2013, and in the Palace Tower (Petit Suite with King Bed) in April 2014 for our wedding. My parents were in the Octavius Tower for the wedding and I'd have to say, the Octavius is my favorite tower so far. Close second is the Palace Tower. Our cousins stayed in the Nobu Tower for the wedding but we haven't had a chance to get their notes on it yet. Will update my review when I do. 

The Forum Shops offer endless shopping and dining options. You could honestly stay at Caesars for 4 days and never have to (or want to) leave! We didn't when we were just there for our wedding April 26, 2014. 

Notes from this past trip:
-Trevi at the Forum Shops for an affordable, classy Italian dinner
-Joe's Seafood, Steak and Stone crab for the highest quality, delicious seafood and steak. GET THE STONE CRAB CLAWS! We had our reception here. (See also: Joe's Seafood, Steak and Stone Crab review).
-Seahorse Lounge: We love this bar as a good middle point meeting place. It's very spacious and the bartenders are on point. 
-Gordon Ramsay Pub: We had our ""Rehearsal"" dinner here Friday night and the food was good. There weren't any complaints except that we didn't realize some of the entrée items would be served a la carte (menu should say so if that's the case). Not sure if that was our oversight or what. 

Notes on the wedding: (See also: Caesars Palace Wedding Chapel review)

My husband and I decided to get married in Las Vegas and we started our search with where we stayed for our first trip to Las Vegas together; Caesars Palace. 

We got our information from Caesars Wedding Services (JoAnn) and did a little further research at other venues (Mandalay Bay, Wynn, Bellagio). We decided to use Caesars Palace as our ceremony venue and we are SO thrilled with our decision. 

Caesars Wedding Services have a wide variety of wedding packages available for all types of groups coming to Vegas for nuptials, and we chose the Cleopatra package and the Juno Garden to accommodate 85 guests. 

Rebecca Profitt was our coordinator and she was very attentive and friendly, and very timely with email and phone response. She was so on top of everything the day of and we did not have to worry about a single thing. We did opted out of having a rehearsal but because Rebecca was so on top of everything and communicating the details to all parties involved in the ceremony, I did not worry for a second. Our day was so beautiful and perfect and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. 

Honorable mention for Rev. Brian Ross. We got SO many compliments on how great he was at the ceremony and how much everyone enjoyed him. I also really appreciated his playful manner and humor while I was in the midst of taking huge cleansing breaths in the bridal holding room waiting for the ceremony to start. 

Thanks for making our wedding day so amazing, Caesars Wedding team!",1,1,2

It's just beautiful. Over the top? Sure. Gaudy? A little. But the white marble, the HUGE ceilings, the roman statuaries...it's just pretty damn cool. 

The sports book is not a room...it's a cavern. A large, huskily-lit cavern which makes you feel small, like a wonder-filled tot. 

The many small bars which dot the landscape are bulwarks of cool, little islands of fashionable nonchalance in a sea of decandent frivolity.

Crossing the barren desert, everyone rejoices when they see the lights and know they are on the strip. This was our first time in Caesar's Palace- we paid online on Caesar's website where the room was advertised as ""pleasing to the senses."" The first contact we made was with Elsa, a loud mouth, rude, snappy front desk attendant. I paid for the room with my B of A debit card and expected no issues as I have been to many, many hotels in Vegas and beyond with no issues. Elsa made a point to berate me for not having provided a credit card- I made it clear that there was more in my account than most people have lines of credit for and eventually had to get a manager as she was making such an issue of it. Meet Tyler Moeller. Tyler is the night hotel manager, he comes across as well spoken and appears to be attentive- he simply does not do anything for you other than nod in mock understanding and say mmmhmmm.  I realized that the pool of people that the recruiting department had to pull from ""was what it was,"" - I made my way to my room. Now keep in mind, it is a Monday( I am writing this as I am sitting in my room now) and we paid top dollar due to Easter being so close. The room was utterly plain and devoid of anything- Hard Rock, Palms, Venetian, Wynn...even Treasure Island, hell, the Tropicana have better rooms. The TV is a barely working 32 inch from 1995( I just had to check) you know, the large 100 plus pound, can't get your arms around TVs of yesteryear. Shocking.  Cheap. Crude. I called and Annisha, the customer service rep answered the phone with a breathy, nasal voice. After a few seconds speaking with her and her limited sentence construction, I realized I was getting nowhere- her last interest was in making sure that I had a good first time.

With using my total rewards I was able to get 3 days here Sunday - Wednesday with only paying the resort fee, which is $20 a night! (Not bad).

You can still notice that this hotel is going through some remodeling in the front. But overall it's a very nice hotel! I got lost on my first night just because the hotel is so big!! I can only talk about the Palace tower (newly remodeled) as that is the tower that I stayed in, rooms 1541 with the view of the side of the strip such as a mirage, Venetian, Linq, Trump and the Aria.

The room itself was nice and spacious!  Spa bath with the Jets and the glass shower! I couldn't ask for anything nicer!

 I did notice that the time that we were here something was going on in their sinks where all they did all night was Thump, thump thump (no water was even coming out!) How annoying! It seems like every time the neighbors on the side of us use the shower or sink that's when the thumping will start, literally it was so loud you can hear it from the bedroom! 

Now! On to the food... Our first night here we ate at Gordon Ramsay! Let me start off by saying the food was good we had the truffle fries, chicken wings and calamari! Just note that their drinks which we had order with margaritas we're damn near $20! I could have just sat at the slot machines and ordered 5 of those to get me buzzed like that one margarita lol overall the food was very good and I cannot complain but I have to admit the next time. The next time I come  here will be if I had a coupon deal!

 Now on to the casino! I have to admit I didn't get that lucky here, but I did see a man hit big $$ on my second night here and he won in less than one hour apart from each other. so the slot machines are very generous it just wasn't nice to me that day! Lol.

The staff and the housekeepers are very nice! I put a Do Not Disturb on my bedroom so they wouldn't have to go in there when I'm not there. But they were so generous in wanting to change the bed linens and towels! A+ for that!

I would definitely stay here again if Total rewards gives me more comp rooms! I also noticed that coming during the week is not bad at all. Less people =less stress!

We are Total Rewards players and had a very good comp stay but were generously upgraded to the Augustus Tower. An elegant spacious room (3989) with a great Bellagio fountain view! Room was very clean and maintained well by house keeping. Beds were firm with high-end linens and comforters. Well stocked mini bar. Nice Sony plasma tv. Furniture was sharp, comfortable and stylish. The bath was great... All current design marble bath with an over sized jetted deep tub, separate shower, separate water closet and nice Qua Spa bath products. Also a small tv, blow dryer, vanity mirror. The room had a good amount of storage area and a safe, iron and ironing board. Hallways are also beautiful design and very clean. 
The pool was a big hit with us since Caesars doesnt tolerate or condone a ""spring break"" scene.... It's a great mix of all ages in a relaxing beautiful setting... They do get busy but chairs are usually available... Food and drink service was great. We really appreciated this well maintained beautiful pool area! 
We enjoyed massages and relaxation at Qua Spa.... A class act spa... Worth every penny! 
Lots of food and shopping throughout the property ... Some affordable some expensive. The casino is up to date and lively with lots of machines and tables... Smoke was comparable to other casinos.

It was a last minute one-night trip, so we figured Caesar's is the best location being central to everything. We drove in from LA, so we did not arrive til 10pm at night to check-in. Since we got there so late, we asked to speak to a manager to see if he can waive the resort fee because we leave at 9am in the morning and won't be using the internet or fitness center. The front desk guy Duncan was rude and would not let us talk to a manager and said there's nothing he could do. After asking a few more times, we gave up and went up to our rooms to get dressed for the night while I called on the room phone to speak to a manager. I was then put on hold for a long time. I hung up and dialed again, and put on hold a 2nd time. By the 3rd call attempt, it has been over an hour since we arrived and I was quite upset with the customer service and lack of urgency to let me speak to manager.

There is so much to see and do for someone who wants to do it all!

The hotel itself is old, but nice. Kind of reminds me of part of the Planet Hollywood layout actually. Literally same layout just roomier. Our room was teeny bit bigger for 2 queens. I mean, the corridor from the room entrance to our beds included a cute small vanity with a bench to get ready, a quite large bathroom with a huge tub, a shower, 2 sinks and a room for the thrown. I think the room alone could have fit at least 4-5 comfortably. 

I checked-in around 230 and they were SO gracious to letting me check-in a little bit early and I got to relax for a bit before I took my adventures on the strip. The view was amazing of the pool! Definitely nice for the summer time, not so much for spring-time sand storms. The towers I would say are kind of far to get to but you get used to it. 

The week I came unfortunately did not have any great performers like Celine. But I will make it a must-see next time I come to Vegas.

The whole Caesars\/Harrahs corporate marriage has reduced the quality of every property in their empire, and this one is certainly less of a Palace than it used to be.  

Very few high rollers in the casino, lots of empty pits that I never saw open, penny slots everywhere, the gambling greatness has obviously gone elsewhere in Vegas.

My room was in the Forum Tower and was quite nice.  Large, contemporary, comfortable.  And I didn't even ask for an upgrade. The only thing to be aware of is that the marble shower, which is huge and featured a seat built into it, leaked to the bathroom floor and left water on the floor, even with a bathmat.  The floor is marble as well, so it got a little slippery, so be careful.  But if, heaven forbid, you should fall in the bathroom, there is a phone in there and a TV built into the mirror, which was very cool.

Everything in this place is expensive, dare I say overpriced. I had a package delivered from the Business Center and got charged $5.00.  I asked for an hour later checkout and got charged for that too.  They have Keurig coffee brewers in the room, but the coffee pods are $12.00 for two, with condiments that barely would be enough for one cup.  And oh yeah, there were no coffee cups in the coffee kit or the room.  

In addition, the hotel is HUGE, and it is a long walk from the front entrance to any room tower, the restaurants (pricey) or anywhere else on the property.  This is one place where paying the bellman a tip to get your bags to your room is a good investment so you don't have to drag them all over the place yourself. On a related note, lines at check out time can be long, so you might want to use the under publicized express checkout on your TV to avoid the lines.  When you check out that way, you get your receipt sent to you via e mail before you get to the lobby.  Pretty sweet. 

One thing that has not changed from the formerly perfect Caesars was the service.  From the people at the front desk and beyond, the service and friendliness of everyone I came into contact with was truly exceptional.  At least the new corporate structure hasn't messed that up.  

There's still something special about Caesars Palace.  It's a Vegas institution, even though it's lost a bit of its luster to some of the newer and more luxurious properties in town.",2,1,0

I've experienced better."" and ""A-OK"", as Caesars would fall between the two.  I stayed in the Palace Tower, a newer building, yet the room was pretty tired with some maintenance issues that should not exist when you're paying $200 a night for your room.  On the good side, the room was large, probably 50% larger than a ""typical"" hotel room, with a seating area that included a sofa and chair.  But my room had some disgusting chemical stains\/spots on the bathroom floor where I just think housekeeping didn't bother to clean, one of the bedside lamps was broken, the A\/C had a thick blanket of dust on it that has not seen a feather duster or rag in quite a while, and one of the sinks backed up and took a very long time to finally drain out.  I would expect to see this level (or lack) of quality at a Best Western or Motel 6.  If my rating of Caesars stopped here, it would rate a single star, however the staff completely blew me away - EVERYONE from the front desk agents to the cocktail servers to dealers, etc., all had a genuine friendliness that made me feel at home.  Also, when playing slots, cocktail servers were asking if I wanted something about every 10 minutes or so (other places I've been at it seems you see someone once every hour).  The best interaction I had was with a lovely lady at 4:00am when I was playing a slot and she was cleaning the other nearby slots with a rag and was really putting some elbow grease into it to make sure it was clean and shining.  When she cleaned the machine next to me, she asked me how my morning was going with such a natural friendliness....when I asked how her day was going, she just glowed and spoke about how it was the beginning of her day but she just knew it was going to be a great one, etc. - let's be frank here, this lady was probably earning minimum wage and in my view was the friendliest Caesar representative I had encountered my entire stay.  I wish I had gotten her name so I could recognize her to Caesars' management more - she is the reason I walked out of there with a smile on my face.

We had upgraded our room to a deluxe by telephone about a week before our and it required a payment of an additional $40 per night. In my opinion it was not worth it! The telephone agent told us the deluxe rooms were newly renovated, had digital do-not-disturb signs, and doorbells. I looked online at the rooms and got extremely excited to see the dark wood colors, modern decor and the dual showerhead in the stall. 

When we get to registration the clerk asks us which tower we would like. First I was annoyed that we didn't automatically get the same tower I had discussed with the agent over the phone. I was so jetlagged I couldn't remember which tower I wanted (the Forum tower) so I simply told the person to give us the best one thinking that that's what we would get. He gave us the Palace Tower because we would have a Jacuzzi bath. It was okay, but disappointing. I was too tired to drag all my luggage back downstairs and ask to change the room so we decided to stay put and crash for the night. 

I've been to LV many times and I've never had the opportunity to stay at Caesar's before. I was thoroughly disappointed because of the price we paid for the room and the quality of the room we received. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the room but it lacked a lot of little touches that I appreciate when I pay a premium to stay in a hotel. It wasn't dirty or old. It was just plain and underwhelming and I basically felt lied to about the room when I upgraded over the phone. In addition, my husband complained about the bed being uncomfortable.

The only thing that was a pleasant surprise was the quality of the bathrobes. I even considered buying one before leaving and I never do that.

Things that were done well
-rooms are clean and I didn't notice any wear-and-tear.
-asked for non-smoking room and received a non-smoking floor with no evidence of smoke smell around.
-If you want tons and tons of space in your room with a hallway that takes up several hundred square feet, choose the palace tower.
-we got a strip view without asking for it.
-The Pussycat Dolls casino which runs Friday thru Sunday is the classiest and funnest party pit I saw on the strip.
-There is a Bank of America atm in the Forum shops.

Done badly:
-Extremely high prices for rooms. They charge 5 star prices for a 4 star property.
-Was told I would get one type of room over the phone. When I showed up I got another. I was too tired and luggage too heavy to change once I realized the error.

These two factors alone encourage me to never stay there again. I would only stay there if I got to stay in the Augustus tower and the room rates were more on par with reality.",3,1,2

It's big, it has lots of marble, lots of slot machines (which don't pay out much), gambling tables, and you will walk about a half mile to your room.  We paid more to stay in one if the newer towers.  We had a nice room in the Octavius tower - we did not get the bed configuration I requested twice, I did ask for a quiet room and ours overlooked the noisy strip, but it was pleasant enough.

For the price and the rating, I thought they might have robes in the room, but nope.

It was okay - the lack of service you expect on check in or check out in Vegas.  There is always a line.  In house restaurants were pleasant enough.  Biggest insult?   They charge $34 and change for a ""resort fee"".  When I asked what that was for, the guy told me ""local calls and internet"".  REALLY???  Does anyone not have a cell phone any more - they need to tack on a resort fee???

Oh and boarding pass printers (yes, I use my phone, but stll like the piece of paper, and EVERY Motel 6 in the county prints boarding passes).

The hotel didn't have our room ready so we checked our bags in with the bellmen.  No problem we were a bit early.  When we did get our room is was enormous.  Now you are thinking wow that's great.  Well that would be great if they didn't furnish it like it was the size of a closet.  It was so sparsely decorated it was odd. The room was very dated and warn like it seemed the last time someone remodeled it was when Elvis headlined in Vegas.  The bed was NOT comfortable and the linens seemed past their prime.  Ok so let me move on to the bathroom.  In a word....Disgusting. You have a white marble bathroom the least you can do is keep it clean.  The white marble is very dated aswell.   The touch-up painting was done by someone who apparently was painting with their left foot.  The towels were like sandpaper (and white towels should NOT have stains on them!!!!

It was so busy for Christmas and the hotel was actually sold out.  When we were checking in this fiercely dressed woman and her husband were complaining and wanted their room changed. Hmmm...I should have taken a tip. So when they were unable to get their room changed we didn't even bother to ask when we got to our room.

My only issue is the parking garage is a good walk depending on which tower you're in.   I like to have my car ready to go on a whim so I'm not a fan of valet as it takes too long to be impulsive.  The other thing is it's SOOOOO big, it can be a bit overwhelming.

Upon check in, we discretely placed a folded $20 bill underneath our credit card and driver's license. Immediately, the man helping us asked if we were here for a special occasion and if he could offer us a room upgrade. We told him we were there for our anniversary, and he promptly upgraded us from the Forum Towers standard room to a Palace Tower Junior Suite! I believe this room costs considerably more per night, so we're so grateful to have found http:\/\/www.thetwentydollartrick.com\/ 

Our room consists of two washrooms, one walk-in shower with TWO shower heads!  There was also an en suite Jacuzzi, a spacious living room, mini bar, four closets, and a really comfortable king sized bed. Our room was on the 27th floor, and had a nice view of the pools. I'm not sure why there are so many complaints of having to walk so much to get to the rooms, but after eating the Buffet of Buffets, I'm glad to walk some of the calories off! Palace towers is right by the pool, which is open everyday. It starts to get packed around 11am, so arrive early to secure a spot! 

The Forum Shops consists of retail shops of all levels - from Burberry to H&M - and restaurants like Max Brenner (see my review of them) and the Cheesecake Factory! 

I recommend registering for a Total Rewards card after checking in, as you will receive $10 credit for food\/drinks, shopping or gambling after 72 hours. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but on the first night, me and my boyfriend both won around $400.00 on the slot machines! I don't know if this was a 'welcome win' since we inserted our Total Rewards card in the slot machine, but it definitely made our day! 

The dealers at the three-card poker tables were all a bit grumpy and unfriendly, but Teroy at the roulette table was a delight! If you look under 30 years old, you will be asked to show your ID pretty much at all the tables\/casinos.

I stayed in the Forum building and finding you way in the casino is a maze.  the signage in the casino does not show the forum or centurion building and instead shows the newer towers.  The rooms in the Forum building is nice, but the hallway was really old.  Also the room I had on the 12th floor did not have a jacuzzi or deep soaking tub like I did when I stayed in the Centurion building. The room is wide, but something were old like the dirty safe in the bathroom. I forgot to mention my closet was also in the bathroom.   The view from my room was facing the front and flamingo hotel with their huge advertisement for Donny and Marie.  Scary when you wake up in the morning to see them. There is a window with a view of the pool area on the elevator landing.  ALso no laundry bags for my dirty clothes.  The toiletries were OKAy -- I still think theHotel at Mandalay bay have the best hotel room toiletries on the strip. I even bought the home size version on this trip.",0,0,0

Can't give maximus star rating since several amenities were minimus. Room had no hair dryer. Keurig coffee maker on-hand but where were the coffee, cups, creamer, etc.? Not complimentary anymore? Not hailing to Caesar for missing this boat. Reserved 3 lounge chairs at the gorgeous pool area but the chairs reserved for us were nowhere near the pool and facing a huge structure.  And many lounge chairs were ratted, so obviously overused and much in need of replacement. WTF Caesar? Paid, reserved lounge chairs should be near the Roman gods and in immaculate shape for visiting goddesses. We opted to seat in the area for peasants. Free and facing the pools!

Caesars Palace is a classic and you absolutely can't go wrong by staying here! The landscaping and statues are so cool! It has always been one of my favorite places to come down and shop and eat! The food options are amazing and a wide range of fine dining as well as the luxury shopping you can do inside of the Forum Shops. If you like high end shopping and expensive meals then look no further! The new nightclub OMINA is located inside of this hotel as well so if you are looking to do the club thing that's also available! One thing I have noticed is that these shops and clubs close down and open so quickly! There has been about 4 different nightclubs inside of here and they always change. Anyways check it out!,4,3,4

I want to give this place more than 3 stars. I really do. Maybe I've been spoiled by staying at The Venetian, Palazzo, and Encore in recent years. But Caesars was just ok and didn't have that wow factor. Service at check in was disappointing. We had an issue with our reservation as it had been done by an affiliate of Priceline. The worker seemed annoyed and was quite rude while she figured out the situation. In the end, we stayed in a standard 2-bed room on the 5th floor of the Palace Tower.

Pros:
- Centrally located on the Strip
- Beautiful pool and awesome pool service
- Forum shops are open quite late
- Valet and luggage service is top notch

Cons:
- Some of the chairs in our room had funky stains and some air vents looked dirty in the restroom. 
- TV in our room kept messing up.
- Check-in service was disappointing.
- Not too many good dining choices.

Everyone comes to Vegas for many different  reasons.  Here is the combination of reasons  I come here: a theme that doesn't bore me, good shopping, good variety of gaming tables, a good club (re-opening in April 2015), location at the 50 yard line of the strip, good variety of shows,  great service, and sister hotels that I can also visit to earn rewards.  All of that AND they have a great spa, pool and conference center which I have yet to experience.

All of that is great but as a Total Rewards member I get comped or discounted for many things making the hotel a great deal and experience.  Make sure you become a Total Rewards member. There are many towers and I prefer to stay in the Augustus. The tower is closest to the front, near the spa, has great views and along with the Octavius Tower are the newest Towers ( other Towers such as the Japanese Themed Nobu are older towers that were remodeled).

Remember that this is Vegas, so we are sticking to the facts and all ""Hangover"" references (indicated by a *) are coincidental.  

As you pull up to the iconic entrance in your stolen police car*, make sure to note the fragrant smell as you go through the revolving doors.  For me that smell reminds me I'm at Caesars.  As you step into the circular reception area, you will note the iconic fountain where you will take that ""I was at Caesar's photo"".  You ask for the ""Hangover Suite"" (there really isn't one) handing over a $20 with your card hoping for an upgrade.  The receptionist likes your generosity and finds you the best available room she can find.  You walk over to the Augustus Tower and step into the elevator and take note of where Alan stood for his grand emperor moment*.

As you enter the room make sure the  chickens don't escape* and carefully check out the spacious bathroom stocked with Qua products from the spa.  If you find a Tiger in your bathroom or a baby in your closet* you definitely will be in for a good time.  The room itself is spacious with 650 square feet of play space modern roman themed decor and a large marble bathroom with double vanities, spa tub, glass shower, and separate water closet.  Again the best rooms you will find for the price.  If you are holding a conference here these are the rooms you put your keynote speakers.

On this particular trip I did not see a show, but highly recommend Absinthe.  The Bacchanal Buffet is very popular as well, but I am partial to Central by Marcel Richard which is located in the lobby across from the registration desk.

My only drawback for this hotel is that on one occasion I did have a grifter on my floor try to sell me some ""roofalus""*. On another occasion some guy tried to grift me out of some cash but this happens at most large hotels.  Just don't look like a target.",1,4,5

As a frequent participant in Vegas "" staycations"" , it's time for me to branch out on my reviews and comment on the local hotels.  Since I'm a semi-degenerate gambler, i tend to focus on the best bang for my buck.  I feel the Caesar\/Harrah's reward program works best for me.

The hub of the Caesar's \/ Harrah's Hotel\/casino's ?  Well, of course - Caesar's !!

Likes - room variety - I'm kinda partial to the Palace tower and the Augustus tower.  The palace tower is the only time i've had a room in America with a bidet ( yet, i didn't try using it ! )  I've only stayed in the Octavious tower once - very similar to the Augustus.

Restaurants - between the hotel and the mall, so many restaurants that are decent to down right excellent, but of course, they ain't cheap.  And of course, the buffet has definitely stepped up it's game !  And as i've recently reported, the food court is above average, price-y but what do you expect at Caesar's.  I need to try the new Ramsay pub - based on Yelp reviews, I'm in for a treat !

Casino - I admit it, i like the fact that it's, ""old - school "" - my guess is the average age of the dealers is 50.  At times, the craps dealers are slow moving which disrupts the flow but i like the old fart's so i tolerate it.  I think the gaming machines are limited but i'm about the craps anyways.

The pool - i've probably stayed at Caesar's at least 20 times and i've yet to USE THE POOL.  I've seen it, looks great.  My friends\/family love it so i trust their judgment.

Comps\/rewards card - They send me frequent freebies - i especially like the contests - bingo, slots, poker etc - I've yet to win big but i've been close.  I like the year end shopping extravaganza - perfect timing for getting Christmas gifts for friends\/family.

Bonus points - priority check in and valet and i get to cut in line at the buffet given diamond card status and i get free tickets for the ""B"" shows every month.

Cesar's is by far my fav strip casino !",1,1,1

We've stayed here twice. Once in a deluxe room in the Palace Tower. It was a nice room. Modern decor. Comfy bed. Marble bathroom with oversize tub and in the middle a huge shower cabin that divides the his\/her bathrooms. Nice view overlooking the pools. 
The other time we had a deluxe room in the Forum Tower. The room was less impressive than the Palace one. Decor was ok. Bathroom was smaller, just had a shower cabin. Although it did have a TV in the bathroom mirror. That was neat. 
Housekeeping skipped our room a few days. Then we got a room next to HVAC system or something b\/c we could hear the machine run from our room. The ice machine didn't work on our floor. The GF was not impress. 
The pool is very nice, one of my fave in Vegas. Everybody knows about the Forum Shops and the endless stores they have. Some good dinning options, everything from a food court to high-end gourmet. Nightlife has Pure and Shadow bar. The casino floor is a tad dated. But it's huge with a nice mix of people. My fave sportsbook, was here for the last Superbowl and it was a rowdy good time.

I like it, but I understand why others aren't so high on this place. It has a little of everything. Good location, in the heart of the strip. If you stay I would book a room in the Augustus\/Palace Towers.

I had stayed at many other hotels on the strip and thought this place would be top notch, ecspecially since she had never been here before.

Where do I start?? First of all, my husband was attending a conference, & we made our reservations for a King room 4 months in advance at the conference price. When we arrived, we were checked into a double TWIN room. When we made this mistake known to the front desk they told us; "" we are very busy with another big conference & near sold out. We can see if tomorrow we can accommodate you better"". It was late, & we were both very tired from the 8 hour drive, so we agreed. 

The next day in between my husband's VERY important conference, he attempted multiple times to remedy the mistake. Each time he was told ""well, maybe we can change your room this afternoon, after housekeeping? But we are near sold out, so we just don't know"". 

At 1 pm the second day of our stay, we were given another room. We packed up all our stuff\/luggage & made our way to the next, supposedly correct room.......MUCH to our dismay, this room was also......you guessed it.....a double TWIN.  So, we slupped our luggage BACK down to the front desk to AGAIN attempt to rectify the mistake. 

FINALLY, on day 2 of our 3 day stay.....we obtained our correct room. Albeit, the crapiest King room they probably had, with a view of the dirty\/dusty, pipe filled roof of the ""good tower"". The wall was PAPER thin, & the drunk guy next door kept smoking in his room despite the wing being ""smoke free"". I could actually SEE the smoke wafting under the adjoining door (that incidentally, his drunk ass kept trying to open, day & night). 

Each time we encountered the front desk person of the hotel, we were met with smiles & apologies, but little else for these logistical mistakes. 

I mean, seriously??? Doesn't the computer system KNOW which rooms are TWINS & which are KINGS?  Seems simple to me??? 

Also, in the land of complimentary hookers & cocaine......all we got was a meaningless ""sorry"" from the front desk for this kind of minimum wage worker folly of errors??   At least toss us a spa credit or something???  For what we paid for this place....you'd think they could actually get the damn reservations right? 

With all the competition & places to stay in Las Vegas....shame, SHAME on ""Caesar's Shack"" for their lack of customer services & mediocre facilities.

For the price we paid ($180 with a discount from our group on a weekend night, split 5 ways), I would love to stay here again.   But would I pay $200+ a night to stay here, even if I could afford it?  Doubtful, when the MGM Grand is less than half that and is pretty much just as good in my opinion.

There are two things that really made Caesar's awesome.   First, I have asthma and am very sensitive to cigarette smoke, which is always somewhat of a concern when I go to Vegas, and I think Caesar's is the least smokey hotel I've been in, save for the Wynn.   Our room was non-smoking on a non-smoking floor, and there was really no hint of cigarette smoke on the floor at all, or in the lobby or common areas of hotel.  Smoking is allowed on the casino floor, obviously, but it was definitely one of the least smokey casino floors I've seen in Vegas, although I'm not sure why (clientele is less inclined to smoke?  better air filtration systems?).   But whatever the reason I was, I was really not at all bothered by smoke here all, which is saying something.

Second, the pool complex is amazing.   At least 6 different pools of varying temperature, which is really nice - you can jump into the cold pool on a hot day and then switch to a hot pool when you get too chilly.   One of the pools is almost completely shaded, another pool has swim up tables, and then there is the special Venus pool (cover charge, although passes are easy to obtain) that has European style swimming.   Definitely one of the nicest pool areas of any hotel on the strip.   They were also surprisingly lax about asking for key cards (we went in several times without showing it), so if you're staying elsewhere you may be able to swim here.

Obviously the location is perfect (my belief is Caesar's defines the center of the strip), and they were also able to give us a complimentary late check-out (1 pm), which was nice and which we took full advantage of.

However, other than those positives, I feel like the hotel has nothing on the MGM Grand or other hotels that are much more mid-range.   The room itself was completely unspectacular, save for the bathroom, which was very large and had a nice jacuzzi.   They promised us 2 queens or 1 king, but we got 2 double beds.   The view from the room was crap.  Food options in the hotel are ridiculously over-priced and don't cater to the younger crowd- there are no cheapy places to grab a coffee or a pastry or some greasy fast food, like McDonalds or Starbucks or anything similar.   Other than $$$ and $$$$ sit-down restaurants, your only food options are Payard, where you can get a $10 nutella crepe, or the Augustus Cafe, which had $15 eggs for breakfast.   We didn't eat a single meal in the hotel, which isn't a big deal, but if you're looking for a really self-contained resort, Caesar's is not it, because you will need to go elsewhere for food.   There also isn't really anything to see or do in the hotel, per se, like the ceilings and the garden in the Bellagio, or the lion habitat at the MGM, so its not a good place for families at all.   

I was also wholly unimpressed with the concierge.  I asked him for recommendations for cheap Mexican for me and my friends, and he recommended 4 places - two of which were not at all cheap (Dos Caminos and Diego), despite the fact that I specifically told him I wanted places where the entrees were under $20.   He was also very snooty and acted like I didn't belong in the hotel at all - after spending nearly 15 minutes talking to the elegant, well-dressed elderly couple in front of me, he summarily dismissed my request in one sentence, and I had to push him to get more details and more options, because I didn't want just one recommendation.   He also didn't offer to make us a reservation anywhere.   Maybe it was because of my age, maybe because I went straight from the pool in a swim cover-up, but truly excellent hotels wait on their guests hand and foot no matter what they look like.",1,0,0

The rooms that are not renovated are absolutely terrible and the rooms that are renovated are way too expensive for what you pay. This hotel in general is really expensive for its caliber because I feel like it's trying to be a Bellagio or Venetian or even Wynn but its only barely topping over Excalibur. If they were to charge such outrageous prices, they should at least renovate ALL their rooms and make them worthwhile.

Otherwise, its mid-strip, lots of HUGE speed bumps so not good for modded cars, and now they've opened a Serendipity on the property for all to gorge. Eh.",6,2,3

I had a wonderful planner on the wedding side named Lindsay and she has nothing to do with what comes next. Caesars just cancelled my wedding ceremony venue 3 weeks out due to ignorance in construction permitting that led all brides until August to find a new venue outside of the Juno Garden. I have already paid for invitations programs etc with this info on it. I'm sure there will be no reimbursement for this at all. Thanks for ruining my wedding day and all keepsakes from it. You construction manager should be fired and sued for incompetence. In the meantime my wedding is ruined and potentially thousands of other girls who got that call saying from today trough August all weddings aren't happening at the Juno Garden. Furthermore I tried to work last ear with your citywide group to secure a reception venue and they consistently blew me off and misquoted me and changed sept heads over the 3 months forcing me to secure a reception venue off property as well.

Shopping. There are so many stores ranging to affordable to extrvagant. Affordable meaning stores like Gap and H & M. And extravagant meaning stoes like Louis Vuitton and Michael Kors. They even extended the shopping space and added a whole other shopping area that is 3 stories high.
Restaurants. Alot of variety as well such as food court options to fine dining and many options in between. The restaurants i highly recommend include Carmine's , Border Grill, Joe's Stone Crab, Gordon Ramsay Pub , and the buffet which is to die for, around $55-$60 for dinner but so worth it. 
CLubbing. The hotel has the club Omnia. One of my personal favorites. They have dj's such as Calvin Harris, Steve Angelo and alot more.

All was well until the third day. I returned to my room to find strangers' things in it. I had asked housekeeping then bell desk to find out if they had any idea where the bags had come from and the individuals I spoke with had told me that they had no record of having put anything in my room. I was then referred to security. They had taken my report and told me that they would look into it. Later in the day when I had called to ask for an update, I was passed around to different individuals. I had to describe my situation to each one. Very frustrating. On day four, the security staff person who took my report called to ask me for any updates from the night before (after shift change). What?!!! Today is day four and Caesars Palace has yet to provide me with a report of what had happened and reassurance that it will not happen again and that I can feel safe in my room. To me that is unacceptable. Makes me wonder if they took my report seriously. Maybe if I was a high roller, I'd be more important to them. 

To add salt to injury, only hours after the first incident, I was woken up at 4:30 am by security and housekeeping because of a flood. I'll not get into further details but it took a long time before I heard from guest services if I had to move rooms, etc., etc.",0,0,0

I got upgraded to a suite and I never wanted to leave the room. The decor was modern yet functional. Lots of space - like 700-800 sq feet. There were two bathrooms - one with just a sink and toilet, the other with a sunken in jacuzzi tub and toilet with a bidet. The bathrooms were adjoined by a shower with dual shower heads. Disappointing there was no free in-room coffee or tea. Had to pay like $15 for it.

There are lots of restaurants and shops at The Forum in Caesar's Palace. You don't even really need to leave the property.

Now on to the bad. Check in was terrible. First my room wasn't ready when I arrived at 1 pm. Fine they held my bag and were supposed to call by 3 pm when it was ready. They never called so I went to the front desk at 4 pm and they gave me my room key. Right when  I walked in the room reeked of smoke though I asked for a non-smoking room. I called the front desk and they tried to move me way across the hotel. I refused so thy finally gave me the min suite in the palace tower. So once I had my room I was fine but he check in was just awful.

My friend checked into her room via text from her email confirmation and just walked up to the bell desk to get her keys & she checked in early. So that's probably your best bet because the front desk check in was bad.",1,0,0

I was expecting more upscale hotel common areas, lounges and casino floors. We even had an updated room in the Palace tower, but it still didn't make up for the less than appealing casino and tacky common areas.  I was also expecting a customer service oriented hotel\/casino staff that most people would expect from any hotel in the US.   We really enjoyed visiting and gambling at the Bellagio, Wynn\/Encore, and Planet Hollywood (all of which had much cheaper rooms when I had booked CP).  The Bellagio and Wynn\/Encore felt and looked (and smelled) 4-5 stars and that is what I had in mind when I booked Caesars. In my opinion, Caesars Palace is a 3 star hotel if you stay in the newer towers.  2 star for the Roman tower rooms.   The poor guest service, outdated 80s lack luster casino areas, and thick throat constricting stench of the place really brings Caesars Palace down. Sure the marble and statues are nice and some areas are nicer than others, but Caesars Palace as a whole is disappointing.  The place reeks of cigar smoke and an airfreshner that is a mix of kitty litter and sunless tanning spray.  The sports book is lacking in a huge way.  If the prices for Caesars were more around $169 or less than it would be a reasonable place to stay.

We paid $330 a night to stay at Caesars and for that price we could have booked the Bellagio and received true Vegas luxury throughout the hotel and casino.    Our room was not comped or discounted.   Our trip was pre-paid and set up through a travel agent.    We were there Nov.4- Nov.7, 2010.    

Check-In was horrible.  As seeing how they have over 3300 rooms, Caesars Palace should be experienced with how to check-in guests efficiently even during the busiest times...that is their job as a hotel.  There should be no excuse for how we were treated like second class citizens upon check-in.   I was very patient, polite and kind to the check-in staff during my dealings with them.   We waited over 7 hours to check-in.   I called to talk with a manager after our return home to let the hotel know about our check-in experience, and the supervisor I talked with could care less.  Apparently, having to wait hours for a room is par for the course during busy times and the hotel doesn't care.  The supervisor chalked it up to being busy and that they have to deal with travelers all of the time (Hello... what hotel doesn't have to deal with travelers??)  It seems like the hotel staff and bar staff and casino staff assumes that everyone is comped and getting a free room because they are the most uncaring and apathetic lot of staff I have ever dealt with at a hotel.   

Our palace tower room was nice, but outdated some.  The casino was lame and slots were tight.  Cocktail waitresses were unattractive and rough on the edges.  This is not the hip place in Vegas to be.  The Forum Shops and Forum shops restaurants are nice. Dont be fooled by the marketing.  Caesars Palace is a rip off!

They would interrupt you; they would keep calling and calling to you, regardless of how many times you said ""No, thank you"".

The tub remained broke the whole trip and the manager only refunded one night's resort fee to compensate us; she could have done better but I wasn't up to arguing her idea of customer service. On another note, they provided a mini-fridge in the room but then filled it with their way overpriced product they want you to buy, so you can't actually use the fridge yourself to keep anything cool. You can't remove the items with the intention of putting them back because they are sitting on sensors which automatically charge your credit card within seconds of being removed. We had to drag a cooler along and fill it with ice - disappointing.

Caesars allowed the audience members into the venue to purchase drinks, buy memorabilia, and fill the audience in anticipation of what is said to be a remarkable concert. For those of us in the audience we never experienced the joy of an Elton John concert; instead we received a dreary voice over the loud speaker informing is that Elton was unable to preform due to illness. This was just prior to 7:40 pm, after the show should have began. Staff had paperwork to hand to audience members addressing how refunds for tickets purchased would be handled showing they knew the concert would be cancelled given the paperwork was dated. Employees claim they had no knowledge the concert would be cancelled but to print out that magnitude of paperwork knowledge would have been necessary. No apology was offered, no replacement concert was put on that night, nothing. 

This concert was my all my days off from work, my hard earned savings for travel and lodging expense, and the tickets were my birthday present. This is a birthday present I will never get to experience. When they announced the cancellation the audience sat in disbelief and frankly I am still in disbelief. I had been looking forward to this concert and it has been said he did not preform because of an argument and disagreement back stage, not due to illness. While I wish Elton the best it is shame I did not get to see him nor did the others in the audience that night. No compensation of any kind has been offered this far and I have filled a complaint with Caesars. 

I just wish there was a way to get this experience that was ripped from me back. I will update this if I ever hear back from Caesars or Elton John's staff.

Maybe some people may think it's tacky, but I thought it was effing awesome. And, the shower. Very roomy with great water pressure. Not only was freshening up a good experience, the naps that we took during the 111 degree weather were great amazing as well. Our king-sized bed was cozy and we didn't have to fight for pillows. Too lazy to get up and close the curtains? Why not just push the button right above the nightstand and have electronics do it for you? Mind blown. The non-smoking room really did not smell like smoke. This place was immaculate.

The casino was excellent. Can't get enough of the SATC slot machines. The Bacchanal Buffet was worth the wait. The next time I go, I will have to remember that it's bigger than it actually looks! The Asian section was in the way back and I amost missed it! The bar Numb was yum. And, the proximity to the restaurants and stores at the Forum Shops was great, too.

I have never had such an unbelievably terrible time with a hotel in my life, and I'm someone who really enjoys staying in hotels, even very simple ones.  As long as the room is clean and the service decent, I'm pretty much a happy camper. Unfortunately this proved to be an impossible task for Caesar's palace.
I went to Vegas with 6 friends for my bachelorette party. I was sooo excited for the weekend, and its really unfortunate, but our collective experience with the hotel really did make it alot less enjoyable.  First, Caesar's did not have one of our three rooms ready at 7pm on a Friday night, when we wanted to check in.  This is sort of ridiculous to begin with.  Next, the hotel concierge tried to charge us a different rate than what I had been quoted (and confirmed via a reservation email) that was $60 per room per night more!  We had to stand at the check-in desk for nearly an hour fighting with her until she finally fixed it.  The front desk staff are incredibly incompetent and unhelpful- it seems they need ""authorization"" from the manager to scratch their asses.
But the highlight of the weekend was definitely when we were finally able to check into the 3d room.  Obviously something DISGUSTING had happened there the night before, which is why the room was not ready upon check in.  Either someone puked or died on the carpet, I swear.  It was one of the most wretched smells I have ever experienced in my life.  We called to complain but 1) noone EVER picks up the front desk line at Caesar's palace, no matter how many times you call 2) once we finally did get in touch with someone in person they were unhelpful and completely unsympathetic, telling us that there was nothing that they could do, as the place was entirely sold out (riiiiiight- with the economy the way it is I am SURE you are 100% sold out).  They did offer to send up a cleaning lady to try to get rid of the smell, which did not happen until I called maid service (twice) on my own.  When they arrived, the head of housekeeping tried to convince us that the wretched smell was the smell of carpet cleaner, and he did nothing to ease the stink. 

We were offered no compensation and no basic human sympathy for the nastiness in the third room.  I felt really bad about it and sort of responsible because I chosen Caesar's and booked all of the rooms for us.  I would never stay there again. Next time I'll stick with the Bellagio, Paris, or Venetian, all of which were perfectly pleasant experiences.",1,0,0

Many other folks will go on about how big it is, and the shopping, and woo! Vegas, and all that.  So I'll skip it and get right to the main deal.

The rooms (Palace Tower) are very nice indeed.  Big soaking Jacuzzi tub, shower, king bed, toilet, and flat screen TV.  So A+ on the rooms.

What is just Plain Wrong is the cost of everything else.

While I thought Vegas made money on gambling, apparently they supplement those millions by charging $12 for a pack of 4 Keurig coffee cups.  And $14 a day for internet.  And $8 for a can of soda.  Holy crap.  Does anybody actually buy this stuff?  I guess one person doing it per day covers the rest, or something.

The staff was above par and quite helpful.

Lots of restaurants, too -- I reviewed those separately.  Mesa was the best.",1,0,0

They also have the Forum Shops, which are amazing! This place is its very own adult playground, if I stayed here I may never leave.

Caesar's is a nice hotel with many restaurants and a huge casino. I enjoyed staying here, but my only gripe is the Octavius Tower is so far from everything! There is no quick trip up to the room, it feels like you walk a mile to get there. Every time we went back to the room for something we ended up just staying there for awhile.

I can honestly say I was surprised and disappointed and I am sorry to say it because I thought I was going to be blown away by one of the most famous hotels on the strip. Ive stayed in other parts of Vegas and around the United States and I can honestly say Cesars would not be my first choice. The room I felt was super plain and nothing came with the room, most hotels provide something and other amenities.  I just felt are room had none of that off the bat. They didn't seem to share that privy information either, even concierge wasn't helpful for one thing passes into their Pure night club. Pure nightclub was nice I liked the layout but I'm talking of my experience and stay at Cesars. They make it appear as if they don't want you to enjoy the the things they offer snacks and such are obviously hiked. 

The neat things  and stuff on a more positive note, over shower head, the fact its connected to some shops and food places that are really good. Kuerig is in your hotel room to make hot water or coffee (hotel sells 4 kcups for 12.00, grocery stores charge 12.00 for a box of 18!). 

We had to change rooms due to a situation and the room was not cleaned well it was obviously rushed and half done. They need to give the cleaning crew a tad bit more time, this is to be a home away from home, you don't want to have to wonder if something was done correctly.

15.00 usd for wifi per each device and 25.00 per day for multi devices in your room only. Who does that?!  
1.00 to 2.00 per minute for a LOCAL CALL IN VEGAS 702  NUMBER, really?! I have never in my life been charged for a local call in a city I'm visiting. Ive been to other hotels in Vegas and Ive not seen such a ludicrous thing. I used my cell the entire time unless I called a place in the hotel.

My last visit to Vegas was for Vegas Uncorked 2009 where I attended two events at Caesar's during my stay. The first was a Dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy(Reviewed separately), and The Grand Tasting which was held at the Caesar's Pool. This was an amazing opportunity to taste food, wine and spirits from over 40 different restaurants and purveyors. The pool was an outstanding venue, except for the fact that they placed the most popular booths (Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, Guy Savoy, Emeril, Joel Robuchon etc.) together, causing a horrible bottleneck.

Not only was it a great weekend, it was by far the greatest Vegas experience I've ever had (and I've had a LOT - stayed in most of the hotels located on the strip!).

Service was impeccable; from the front desk to the pool attendants, everyone was kind, caring, attentive and appreciative of your business. This is HUGE for me. It's frustrating to stay in one of the newer hotels and feel like your being treated like a second class citizen because you're not staying in their penthouse. And when we tipped a bell hop or parking attendant, they took it with appreciation (unlike most my experiences when they just expect it).

Rooms were great; beds were super comfy, loved the shower (and the shower pressure) and the fact that it had a spa tub - just bummed I never got the chance to use it!

The pool was the perfect amount of relaxation with a good time. If you're into the whole clubbing-pool idea and want to pay at least $50 to layout on a pool chair, then this isn't the spot for you. The pool had a great mix of music from oldies to top 40's, the drinks were fabulous, and the pool attendant passed out complimentary otter pops while we were hanging out. What's not to love?!

We went to Spago's for dinner - between the entire group, the reviews ranged from mediocre food to great. Mine was great (I ordered the New York steak) and I'm writing the review which is why it still gets 5-stars for me! But the service was fantastic! Our server was Charlotte - she was absolutely lovely; she was hilarious, helpful and knew how to get it done.

After dinner, we ventured to Pure. Seeing as we were a bachelorette party, we were asked to join the VIP section which, I'll give you this, definitely made the entire experience 5-star worthy. That said, after several drinks, one of our group members was warned several times that if she continued to drink\/dance crazy, she would be asked to leave and eventually she was. However, even THAT experience was pleasant! The bouncers were really nice and understanding about the situation.*

At checkout, unfortunately I had to physically go checkout because I had to swap out credit cards to pay the balance. Were the lines long? Yes. Are the lines long everywhere on a Sunday checkout day? Yes. Why was this a 5-star experience? Because they offered complimentary waters while we waited in line.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice and tasteful Vegas experience - stay at Caesars.

* Our 5-star experience at Pure MAY have been because it was the weekend of Coachella which meant not a lot of celebrities around to take up the VIP areas. If that were the case, I'm incredibly thankful that the bride-to-be inadvertently scheduled her trip during that time!",1,1,0

Do not come here on a budget unless you are the U. S. Government. Do plan on spending money for lodging, food, drinks, entertainment and whatever. 

The Palace Tower is nice and the bathrooms are better than nice. Service was also very pleasant and we had no complaints with room service or housekeeping. 

The one absolutely exasperating to the point of harassment was going to and from the elevators in the Palace Tower. There were two businesses that you had to pass that jumped on everyone to buy their products. They would not enter the corridor but stand in their respective doorways and waylay you each and every time you past their doors. All in an effort to sell you their merchandise.  And if you are visiting for a week and active as we were the sales pitch gets old very fast. You can expect this on the Strip and it is out there too. But inside a luxury hotel such as Caesar's it brings the star rating down for me. 

The place other than the expense and the hawkers on your way to and from your room is an experience. The gambling is all over the place and the restaurants will have your taste buds jumping. That was all good. Separate reviews for the restaurants are being posted.

It offers the best selection of restaurants with Rao's and Border Grill being our favorites.  Bobby Flays Mesa Grill is also a winner.   The Forum Shops are a great place to wander around and shop.

Our two sons love the pools.  It is surprising for a place that never sleeps that the pools close so early at 7pm.  I wish they stayed open longer.   
So now the reason for the four stars.   We booked our suite in the newer Octavious Tower because we have never tried it and usually stay in the Augustus Tower.  We checked in and were given our room.  We saw that the clerk gave us a room in the Augustus tower when it clearly said on our reservation Octavious.   We said no we wanted to try the newer tower.   He told us that they were changing all of the prices to match as part of their new Laurel Collection and the rooms are the same.  No they are not and we still want our room.  He then began making excuses that we booked through a third party.  Try again when my wife pulled out the reservation booked through the hotel's website.  He stopped mid sentence.  After a few more attempts to persuade us he gave us the room we wanted.   We still can't figure out why this happened but make sure if you have a room booked already they don't switch you up.

The '60's are gone.  The days when Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin were the big shots is long gone.  Caesars has reinvented itself and has done a good job, but other casinos are raising the bar.  In fact too many to mention have raised the bar.

Caesars is enjoyable. But it took too long to check in. The convention area is a long, long walk and confusing too.  It's now more of a mid-level property than the 'high roller' or luxury hotel of the past.

In many ways it is now a mainstream, middle class hotel living on a reputation from almost 50 years ago.

It was pricey, since we stayed during spring break week. As a matter of fact, their room is always pricey. We stayed in the Octavius Tower.

Since there aren't a lot of Caesars Palace room tour on YouTube, I've decided to take matter into my own hand and recorded a full room tour for you guys to check out. So here's the video of the Octavius Luxury Tower room.

https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GiS8qBRL6kM

The room is very spacious and looks pretty high-end.

The bathroom has 2 fancy sinks and a very larger shower. It also has a big tub with few jet nozzles. and of course a little tv in the bathroom when you wash your face or put on make-up.

I've also recorded a Full Tour of the Pool area. So here's the full video on that:

https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GCxBgc0ATfk

There are a total of 5 pools that I counted when I was there. Looks pretty neat. I don't think they have a hot Jacuzzi\/spa. I do have to say that the pool is heated.

The only thing I didn't like is that they now tack on a mandatory Resort fee of $25. I think they started adding resort fee last year in February. 

So if you guys are planning on staying at Casesars Palace and want to see what the room looks like before you guys book. Here's a full tour of Octavius Tower Room:

We stayed in the Roman tower & I wasnt impressed. Decor is drab and dated, there's no coffee maker, fridge or microwave in the room & the plumbing needs work. The shower head leaked so badly that only half of the water coming out of it actually reached the person trying to shower. The drain was so slow that it was like taking a bath and a shower at the same time. 

This hotel was not designed for R&R. Constantly heard doors slamming. Not sure if the party staying above us had a lot of kids or was training for a marathon. Sleep was short & scarce. Beds were comfy though.

The balcony-like structure outside of our room was for decoration. There's no door to access it & the window could only be opened with a special key. Cell phone reception in the room was spotty.

Staff was terrible. Most of them acted as if we were inconveniencing them. We experienced several inconveniences of our own while we were here:

1. Bellman brought my best friend's bags to our room but handled them so roughly that he broke a bottle of alcohol inside. After some teeth pulling, the hotel finally comped her a bottle. If you dont like your job, cool. Just dont take it out on our stuff.

2. We asked another bellman passing by to take our picture. He look visibly annoyed but begrudgingly agreed. Before my best friend could get her phone completely out of her purse, he snatched it from her. We didnt get his name but we returned to our room to report the incident. This required at least 30 mins of recounting the story to person after person on the phone & filing a complaint report. Moreover, the staff didnt seem very interested in trying to identify the offending bellman even though we gave them more than enough information to determine who he was.

3. One of the maids decided to completely rearrange our room. We had receipts & other paperwork on the desk and end tables before she came in. When we came back, they were all missing, along with my sleeping clothes (which I put in the same spot every morning). Had to file another report, plus meet with both the Housekeeping supervisor and Security. They interviewed the maid, who said that she didnt touch anything. After two days of searching, we found that she'd stuck my clothes in my best friend's suitcase (not a mistake we would've made, trust me), and stashed the receipts in one of the in-room magazines. 

The hotel offers a number of pools that are a great place to cool off, relax and people watch. Get there early to get a good seat. By lunch time, it's packed. I didnt like the fact that there wasn't a designated smoking area, though. On more than one occasion some idiot was carelessly blowing smoke in my direction. 

We noticed that the pool staff only ask people with a ""certain look"" (take that how you will)  to present their room key before entering the pool area. We observed this on more than a few occasions. My best friend went back to ask why that was & one of the staff members replied that she ""doesnt make the rules"". So, if you're not bleached blonde and scrawny, prepare to get profiled. 

Avoid the Forever Flawless store. They're hawking overpriced products with dubious results. If you find a product you like, do your research. Ive read more than a few reviews that say that the $400 eye creams can be negotiated down to $50... and that even then they're not worth it. A quick Google search also revealed that they often use illegal Israeli immigrants to staff their stores. We went to our room to do more research on the product & when we called the store & asked the ""manager"" about it, she quickly changed the subject, sputtering out something like, ""Sure, you can come in at 3:00 for your facial"" and hung up.

Think ""fine dining"" at every meal is overrated? There is a food court in the hotel by the Forum Tower\/Forum Shops, with meal options priced in the single-digits. There's Smashburger, Earl of Sandwich, an Asian themed noodle place and another place that sells tacos. Smashburger is the only place that sells breakfast in the food court (besides Starbucks), and options are limited. But if you're really hungry, it'll do. 

Cafe Americana sells a good grilled chicken breast sandwich  if you want something delicious and not terribly unhealthy. Ordered a salmon croque sandwich from the French cafe, Payard. No good. It was more bread than anything and looked nothing like the sandwich on display. Plus $5 for a cup of tea. No way. (Pro tip: There's hot water in gym, of all places. Water machine in the fitness center, left handle. Be sure to use two cups, because that heat seeps through that cup really fast! Bring the tea of your choice and enjoy.) My best friend had to negotiate with the staff (which spoke way too little English for this job) just to get a side of Canadian bacon. Not worth it.

Beautiful Roman statues and fountains with multiple (8) pools and enough lounging chairs to accommodate. My fave were the swim up blackjack tables in the Fortuna pool and the Venus topless pool. The European style topless pool has its own bar and is partitioned from the other pools by dense foliage and a 21 & over ID check.

I got a free upgrade to the Augustus tower. It is one of the newer towers, so I expected it would have modern upgrades. Granted, the room has a spa tub and granite tile shower with a large shower head. However, Caesars fails to meet expectations by the small TV in the main room area, a tv in the bathroom that is not hooked to the same cable tv system as the main tv, a Keurig coffee make without any coffee supplies, and most importantly, a place where most hotels fail in this age of mobile devices, there is a huge lack of power outlet locations for charging devices. 

In Vegas, be ready to walk, and Caesars is no exception. The parking lot is far away and the forum shops are long stretches of mazes. 

Just because of where you are, expect to pay more. As if Starbucks coffee weren't expensive enough, Caesars Starbucks charges double the price in many cases. 

One thing I like about Caesars is that at the blackjack table, I can play two hands without having to bet double the minimum. Also, this is one of the few places that still shuffles by hand, giving you that mental break in between shoes. That's one classic part of Vegas they need to keep. 

The problem with many casinos is the shift to eye-candy dealers like their Pussycat Dolls blackjack area where they take away the players' margin of winning by paying blackjack at 6-to-5 instead of 3-to-2. Sure sometimes the dealers are nice to look at, but don't play at those tables.",2,0,0

In fact, the guy who checked us in was very friendly and actually upgraded our room . However, I was with a large group of ladies attending a conference, so we had several different rooms and everyone checking in separately . One member of our party was the last to arrive and was given a smoking room when she asked for a non smoking room . She went back down to talk to the people in the front desk and they told her that it was "" too bad"" and a non smoking room was not guaranteed . She explained how she could not be in a smoking room because of her eyes, nose , throat etc. and asked to speak to a manager . The guy replies "" there's no one here higher than me ."" Needless to say, after over an hour of arguing, they did finally move her . All our party was on the 5th floor with spacious rooms and a spa tub . She was given a tiny room in a completely separate tower on the 59th floor with only a shower- no spa tub . Also, upon arrival she noticed the phone in the room did not work - nice way to avoid a complaint to the front desk huh ?!

Unfortunately, it doesn't end there . We attended the last day of our conference , which was IN Caesars and ended at 12. We all asked for a late check out . Everything went smoothly for everyone -except our person in floor 59! She went up to the separate tower to floor 59 to find that they had reset her key.

Went for CES 2011, attended the event last day, and the room rate that Sunday was like 200 bucks cheaper than one night ago, so I booked a room for only 76 plus tax. A great deal for Caesars Palace.. Upon checking in I found out they only gave me a room on a lower level so I couldn't see anything outside the window. But it's OK. I don't wanna 
see that every time I go there.

Remember last year Harrah's Entertainment promotes a lot on their decision to eliminate resort fees? Well no resort fee on their properties but you'd have to pay Internet if you want access in your room for about 15 bucks per 24 hour period. In fact you can't even stay in your room for 24 hours and you can use your phone to browse the Internet, why should you pay for that ridiculous charge? When I go to Vegas I just bring my laptop to a Starbucks on Paradise and sip the drink while checking emails, so there's no way I'd pay for that rip-off. But I was just so tired that day and didn't want to make any move so I just decided to be kind enough to them as I got a good deal on the stay. Oops but the wireless on my side of the floor wasn't working I soon found out so I called up the front desk and they transferred me to COX where they solve all the technical problems. The gentleman I talked to over the phone was very nice but after several rebooting both on my computer and their router, they still couldn't solve it which left me the only option to use the plug-in cord. a great excuse to tell the front desk to comp the Internet charge for me which they did. Nice.. oh and the people at CES gave me a badge for free so I didn't even have to buy a student pass. Thanks a lot. 

So remember people, just make a call and they could sometimes waive the overpriced charge because as a human they know it's unreasonable too.

oh can they PLEASE STOP DESIGNING SELF-PARKING, HOTEL CHECK-IN and TOWER ELEVATORS EACH ON a VERTEX of a TRIANGLE? I'm tired of walking so much every time I check into a hotel.

I've stayed on various properties along the strip and this has been my favorite for a few very important reasons: Decor, cost, and location. 

Location: Mandalay bay, Palazzo, and the Wynn are too far -- Since you don't spend a lot of time in your room anyway (and you shouldn't), it's really nice being in the middle of the strip and close to every major attraction. The forum shops attached to Caesars is one of my favorite places to shop! What a winner!
Decor: There's a cheesy roman theme here, but it's now gaudy like the Monte Carlo and the rooms are actually very nice. It's an interesting place to be, and definitely one of the newer hotels. More importantly, it's also very clean.
Price: This is the kicker for me. You have your standard marbled sinks, heated floors, and jacuzzi tubs in a basic room. Anything else around the Caesars Palace price range does not get you anything better.",0,0,0

I visited during a busy weekend and was happy to get several emails asking me to check-in online so they could be ready for me when I showed up.  They also mentioned that I could use the VIP Porte Cochere on Flamingo Ave instead of the main on-strip entrance.  So, after battling the hideous strip traffic, I went right by the main entrance, which was a zoo, and zipped into the VIP entrance only to see two signs:   one said ""Laurel Collection.""  The other said ""Valet Full:  Seven Stars and Diamond Only.""

When I asked the valet what to do the Valet Full sign won -- I was Laurel Collection, but not Seven Stars or Diamond -- he rejected me and offered lame directions to get back to the main entrance -- which I did some 30 minutes later.  I was livid.  

Think about this:  I was at the main entrance, I drove by it because they said I could use the VIP side entrance, and then they wouldn't let me.  So I had to cross Interstate 15, come back up Flamingo, sit through numerous light cycles, finally make the left onto the Strip, and then fight to make the left turn into Caesar's ... all in all taking me to self-parking -- the farthest possible spot from the Porte Cochere --  which, by the way, was itself jammed.

On arriving I told them this tale, and a manager named Andrew offered to put a $50 food and beverage credit on my bill.  After I left, I noticed that they couldn't even get that right -- no such credit was applied.  F**k you very much.  Empty promises squared.

All that aside, Caeser's is simply too big for its own good and unless you are Diamond or Seven Stars you will most likely find yourself -- even in the Laurel Collection -- treated as a 2nd or 3rd-class citizen.

By the way, I think ""Laurel Collection"" is Greek for ""far from everything.""  The rooms are nice, but far from the center of the action so think ""more walking"" which is just the thing that everyone wants to do in Vegas.  The other amazing BS was that my room was on the ""61st floor"" in a building that maybe had 40 floors.",4,5,0

No redbull(monster only)\/top shelf liquor in the pokerroom. Waitresses are very attractive, but hey its Vegas. Personally I like the 1-3 here better than the 1-2 at Bellagio (200 max) or the Aria.

Sportsbook: I've placed several bets here however I've never stuck around to watch a game. The seats are always taken and full. The nice thing is you can cash in your ticket at any Harrah's property.

I go to Vegas for one reason and one reason only, and that's to have fun and Caesar's Palace is definitely a FUN resort. There's so much energy and movement, it totally embodies the spirit of Las Vegas. I stayed in the Augustus Tower which has easy access to the casino entrance, plus its own Starbucks in the lobby. 
My favorite thing about Caesar's (besides the buffet, Bacchanal, which was so good, it deserves its own review) was how many tiny little bars they located all over the casino floor. If you ever wanted to take a break and sit down (and not drink those watered down gaming drinks they pass out) you could easily find a fun bar to grab a quick cold one. I went to a few other hotels during this visit and that was not something they all offered. It's just nice so that you still feel part of the action, but not throwing all your money down a machine( throw it at a bartender instead, they are MUCH more appreciative!) 

It's easy to get lost wandering through here, but there's so much to look at it never really matters. It's practically dead center on the strip so it made it easy to get around to all the other casinos, especially because my friends were staying in a different hotel.

Pros: the location on the strip

Cons: -very poor customer service. The front desk is understaffed for check in and the employees are strained and ready to snap, leaving a rude first impression.

- rooms are not worth the extra money. We booked their basic room, and were so disappointed we decided to upgrade. The basic room consisted of a moldy, outdated room with only a bed and a dresser. After spending the first night tossing and turning on their cheap horrible pillows, I went downstairs to look at upgrading. I explained to them my dissatisfaction thus far and they happily charged me full price to upgrade,  which leaves me to my next con. 

-No accommodations. It's my girlfriends birthday and we couldn't even get a free bandaid for a cut she had,they directed us to the gift shop to buy a box. We're now in an upgraded room, and not even the coffee is free. (Tip: the mini bar in the room has weight sensors and will automatically charge you if you even pick up an item. They're counting on people not noticing the extra charges upon checkout.)

-not very high quality. cigarette smoke coming through the air conditioning vent into our NON smoking room. The ice machine on our floor didn't work and nobody came to fix it.

I ordered a Pina Colada for $14, which was pretty pricey, but the atmosphere was great!

As for the entertainment, the Atlantis show always entertains me, and I highly recommend grabbing a drink or snack from Fat Tuesday (few steps away from the Atlantis fountain) to enjoy while watching the show. By the way, the Atlantis show is easily my favorite out of the other shows they offer at the other fountains, so make sure you watch it -- shows appear every half hour, if I'm not mistaken.

Caesar's is also home to Serendipity 3, which is an awesome restaurant\/dessert parlor. This hotel is one of the best to go for shopping, since they don't only have stores that only rich folk can purchase stuff from.

So I decided to get a room at midnight at the Palazzo, called the Caesars was on hold for 15 minutes before I gave up, thinking I shouldn't tie up lines to people who might actually need help to reach family members and friends. After waiting up worried sick for my disabled father to confirm he was safe at his hotel I finally slept at 3am. I wake at 6am, and make it to Caesar's so I can gather my belongings and check out.

 I didn't want my room comped, I understand they are a business but I asked if they could do anything to meet me half way since I had to pay for another room out of pocket in the name of the obstacles I would face to return to their property safely and even risk being locked out when I did arrive. They said ""The front desk has been informed we will not be offering any type of compensation given last nights events"" Wow! She then stared at me like ""Next.""

 I loved this hotel it always had such positive great feelings associated with it. But now, I will never stay there again, I will not gamble in any of their casinos or eat any of their restaurants. The luster is gone, and all that remains is this place didn't give a crap about me or my safety as a guest, or being compassionate, just my money. Sad. Sad, because if I would have made a scene or lead with an exaggerated sense of entitlement, or been made of money, I bet it would have been different for me, I'm just not that kind of person and in this instance the nice guy finished last.",22,0,0

Caesars Palace offers THE BEST shopping in VEGAS! The Forum SHOPS ARE AMAZING!!!! Every store you can think of, for every budget. Versace store is bomb.com! ALWAYS my first stop at Caesars.  The casino itself is large, but not for gamblers. Too many distractions

It included limited wifi and we had no choice so we didn't argue. When we got to our room in the Palace Tower it was ok but a bit shabby looking. We noticed a coffee machine and thought at least we can have a cup in the AM before looking for a reasonable breakfast place, but it was not to be. They charge $13 for 4 K cups and had no free options. We have traveled all over the US and the world and never saw that. A bit annoyed, we visited Walgreens and purchased instant coffee, juice and milk as well as some pastries. We thought ""problem solved"" until our check out. They charged us $25 for using the space in the minibar for our juice and milk, claiming it was not a refrigerator and they said there was a sign saying that. Guess what, no sign that we saw. We argued and were told they would ""investigate"" our claim. Since we had to catch a plane we couldn't pursue it and I'm fairly certain we will never receive our $25 back.

They offer something for everyone: the best shopping on The Strip (maybe in the world?), massive sports book, huge casino floor, nostalgia for the grandparents, The Hangover references for the younger folks, cheap restaurants, fancy restaurants, shows, you name it...  

... which makes Caesar's one of my favorite stops to *visit*, despite the fact that I have always had terrible luck gambling there.  

It's a 3 star review from me for *staying* there though for a few reasons:

(1) Unless you know to request a specific tower, some of them are very old.  If you gamble with the luck of the draw, you might get a nice room, or you might get a terrible room.  Per my opening statement, they're constantly renovating and improving them, but they have almost 4,000 rooms in the property.  It's a lot to renovate, and they have been open for almost 50 years, so it takes a long time.    

(2) Their casino ventilation is not good.  People smoke in every casino, but the smoke lingers in Caesar's more than other places

(3) Their pricing can be insane.  It's not uncommon for their rooms to be significantly more expensive than the Wynn or the Bellagio.  For all their efforts, Caesar's Palace isn't on the same level as the upper tier, so seeing that people are paying upwards of 2x to stay there always confuses me.  

(4) Older clientele.  There are a LOT of Caesar's properties across the country, so Caesar's attracts a disproportionate amount of senior citizens (vs. every other property on The Strip not named Harrahs) who can use their home status for upgrades and comps.",1,0,0

What made it even better was I stayed here FREE (3 days 2 nts)!!!!  I am not talking about their classic guest room.  I am talking about the Augustus Tower room!!!  These rooms run for about $450 per night on weekends!!! 

I usually stay at the Venetian (also free) because I like the big suite room, but I thought I'd check out Caesars.  I checked in at the Diamond Check-in and the staff was very courteous.  When I first walked into the room, my jaw almost dropped with a 'WOW'.  It was ultra modern and very luxurious looking.  Although not quite as big as a suite, it was very roomy with a nice couch and chair in the sitting area.  I am guessing the room is about 600 sq ft.  We had a gorgeous view of the Garden of Gods Pool.  Double-vanity marble bathroom with a walk-in shower and Jacuzzi tub which I took full advantage of every night!  32"" Plasma TV in the room with a 17"" in the bathroom.  And the bed, OMG, the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in with plush comforter and pillows.  I loved it so much I contacted the hotel concierge to find out where we could purchase it.  Honey got it for me as my birthday present!!!!  The bed was by Serta.  

Their diamond lounge is the best diamond lounge among all Harrah's chain.  There is also a seven-star lounge that I doubt I'd ever make it in (100,000 points to become 7-star member).  The diamond lounge is good enough for me.  It serves hot breakfast - scrambled eggs and bacon, sandwiches and wraps for lunch, and hot appetizers along with sandwiches for dinner.  Pastries, cheese and crackers, pasta salad, and fresh fruits are served all day long.  You can get just about any kind of drinks you want from the bar.  Everything is free, just make sure you tip the server who brings you the drinks.  

This is where a lot of celebrities stay and we ran into one in the elevator.  He was super nice and even chatted with us.  I promised him I was not going to harass him with a picture.  And he said he was happy that we recognized him.  

The Forum Shops and Appian Way Shops are huge if you like shopping.  You will find all the designer labels if you are into that.  There are so many restaurants to choose from, too, from cafe to steakhouse.  Another advantage of being a diamond card holder is that I get to go in the diamond line and skip the long wait.

1. Automatic check in machines... painful is the word I would best use to describe the process of trying to figure it out. After 5 failed attempts to read in my ID, a hotel rep finally helped us out. After checking in through the ""automatic"" machine around 12pm, it said we would be notified via email when out room was ready. Sure enough no email til 3:59pm... Thank goodness we ended up just going to the front desk to try to re-check in around 2:30pm and get a room earlier so we could relax a bit before the 5pm wedding we were there for.

2. The room with King bed we got at the Julius tower was clean, but felt small and crammed. At least it was quiet for the night, so no complaints there.

3. What the heck is going on with the carpet in the lobby?! Either they don't vacuum it at all or it's shedding like no other. This carpet shedding that's going on downstairs gets caught in your shoes via static and got all over our clean room. Gross.

4. Food court prices are hiked up at Caesars. I kid you not the same Earl of Sandwich we bought at Planet Hollywood costs $2 more here.

Not sure I got anything really positive to say here. Almost debating going 1 star on this one when I come to think of what I paid for the room. I had such good memories and fun times staying here years ago. What a shame.

When I explained how I booked the room through a promo with Travelzoo, Josh asked me who Travelzoo was....  oh boy, I knew we were in for a long phone call.   It was one of the most stressful experiences I have had in a very long time - for something as stupid as booking a hotel room of all things (really people??), as I was home in California and not there in person with our guests to rectify the situation.  After calls to Travelzoo, Caesars concierge (Meredith is a shining star there!), and holding on two phones with the hotel check-in staff, 30+ minutes later, the problem was resolved.

We had been to Caesars in years past, and think we won't be going back - there are too many other lodging options for people in Las Vegas.  Two words - Customer Service.

We arrived at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and stood in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in (there were only 4 parties in front of us). When we reached the counter we were told that check-in was between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. So we took our luggage to be stored at the bell desk and headed off to watch football. We returned at 4:45 to check in and got in a line with only 3 people ahead of us. It took FIFTY MINUTES before we reached the counter because there was only one person working. This gentleman then told us that our room wasn't ready (the same thing he told the three people before us) without even bothering to look up. By this time the line of people waiting was backed up to the casino entrance. After asking to speak to a manager our room was magically ready.   When we went to retrieve our luggage from the bell desk we were told to go outside and get it from the valet stand. 
Once we arrived in our room, it was in desperate need of an update. The furniture was out-of-date and worn, the bathroom was out of the 70's, and the bed swayed in the middle like a 20 year old horse.

This was my first experience at Caesars.  What really sold us in the first place is the location, we never stayed there, and of course the extra $75 in our pocket for resort fees.

The experience with the service was great and location is excellent so overall it gets my full five star.

We came for New Years.  Valet as with pretty much all Vegas hotels is complimentary. The Hotel\/Casino is beautiful with tons of restaurants and shopping to match. 

The customer service was so exceptional here and really started our 2012 off the right way.  My friend Will and I arrived and upon checking in the front desk attendant asked if one King bed was ok.  We asked her for two beds.  

She took a few moments, apologized for our wait, and then came back to tell us unfortunately they did not have two beds, so they upgraded us to a 1300 sq ft suite facing the strip and that they would get us a rollaway and if that was acceptable for us.  We were like....hell ya!!! 

So off we went to our Suite.  Beautiful!!! Pics attached. 

The rest of the stay was excellent. They called to follow up and check that our stay was great.  If you asked someone at the hotel if they knew the direction of a specific area....they would not only point you there. They would often walk you there.  

I could not believe that in such a busy time of New Years that they really made so much effort to ensure their guests were taken care of. A+",8,6,10

However, it has forever been out of my price range. This past weekend my friends and I scored a great deal and had the pleasure of staying at Ceasars.  We checked in and a room wasn't ready in Forum tower where we booked, so we were upgraded to the Palace Tower. Our room was very nice, spacious and I loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the extra vanity in the room. It made getting ready soo easy! (3 girls in the room). 

The decor is calming and nice and the beds were very comfortable. The great thing about Ceasars is that there is SOO much to do in the hotel, you really don't have to leave. Many restaurants, a food court for casual dining, nightlife,(Pure\/Shadow) shopping and other random gems like salons,etc. The staff was always more than accommodating... the valet, bell hops and housekeeping staff were extremely friendly. Whenever I called the front desk I was asked how I was enjoying my stay every time.  

There was one major con... we ordered room service it was at 3am, so I will give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The chicken wings were fine, the nachos were okay, but the chicken soup was disgusting. The broth was just water and they used fettuccine noodles!! My soup was packed with gross noodles, broiled unseasoned chicken and water broth and my friends was all broth (better seasoned) , barely any noodles and no chicken. I was horrified...I couldn't eat it. I was going to send it back, but my friend ate both soups (she must have been very hungry). For the exorbitant price of room service I was appalled, I would have been much happier had they just opened a can of Campbell's.

Although it was winter in January, the room kept getting hot enough that I had to keep turning the AC on and it never seemed to get to where I wanted it.  The shower was horrible as there is extremely low water pressure.  Don't try to turn on the sink or flush the toilet when someone is in the shower.  Our ""automatic"" drapes never worked as one side always got stuck and we had to move it manually.  I complained to the front desk about these little issues, which never seemed to get resolved.

Upon planning my escape from Hostel Cat the pervious night I had accidentally booked a room for one night with a king sized bed. My travelling companion Speculos Beamos was revelling in joy at the prospect of sharing a bed with me, I was not to say the least. The moment I checked in, the woman at the check in desk was quick to fix this and gave me an upgrade immediately. We rushed up to the room to find two queen beds and the grandest bathroom ever built by the Roman's, complete with a large shower and a hot tub jacuzzi. 

Speculos commented on how the iron and the ironing board were made of the finest Roman technology and he had managed to eliminate the creases in his shirt that he had never been ever to get rid of. I happily sat in a daze watching TV in my native Japanese language. 

I decided to try the hot tub and I fell into a state of euphoria that I have never felt since. Speculos has tried many a time to make me feel this again but he has failed so many times. 

The gambling is great, I had managed to win $62,000 that night and treated myself to a cigar and fine glass of brandy as I took pride in my victory. I was even propositioned by a few ladies of the night but I turned them down as I told them I was getting married.

I have traveled all over the world and have stayed at different calibre places- from 5 star resorts, motels, and even 3rd world country bungalows in remote villages. I have never been so disgusted in my life than I have with my recent stay at Caesars. 

We had booked the VIP Absolut Suite at Caesars and were HIGHLY disappointed. The room is NOTHING like what they advertise in the pictures. For spending $4,000 a night, it was the biggest waste of money.

We get to the hotel early to check in, and get situated to start our fun filled weekend. The first disappointment occurred with us waiting 45 minutes for the bellman to take our luggage from valet to the inside of the hotel. I literally had to push the cart myself to get it in. Standing in the heat outside of the hotel for nearly an hour was definitely not how I wanted to start my weekend. We go in to check in and reservations said the room would be ready in an hour.  Since it was an hour wait, we went to have an early lunch and came back 2 hours later to give them enough time. The room was still not ready and were told that they didnt know when it would be cleaned. Even with American Express Platinum Early Check in, the hotel screwed us over with our room. We had a Cabana reserved at Encore Beach, and almost lost our reservation.  We had to go through our luggage in the middle of the lobby, take our clothes,  change and get ready in the public restrooms.

Later on in the day once we were able to check in and received our keys, we go to the room and the keys didnt work. We had to go back down to get new keys 2x. At that point, one of our guys pushed the door in and the doors opened without a problem. In order for us to get into the room the entire weekend, we had to push our way in because the keys didnt work. Maintenance came at least 3 times to attempt to fix the electronic panel on the door (it was never fixed.)

The service was horrible, we waited 20 minutes on the phone in order to receive any customer service. For VIP treatment, we were treated as if we didnt exist. 
The rooms were disgusting and the beds were dirty. The showers and bathrooms were filthy with remaining bodily fluids still present. The bathrooms definitely were not cleaned. Housekeeping came both days but only cleaned the downstairs living room. We had to call the front desk 2x to tell them to come and clean the bedrooms and the bathrooms. Their response was that they ""forgot"". 

We tried reasoning with Guest services but they did nothing to help or accommodate us.   

After those 2 days we could not take it anymore. We had to check out of the hotel. To spite our group, the bellman from Caesars sprinkled and threw a can of Comet all over the inside of one of our bags. All of my clothes and shoes were ruined. We have pictures of this monstrosity.

We went to Wynn to stay for our final night. We had a basic room and were treated like royalty. If you want an amazing and luxurious experience, stay at the Wynn and don't even bother at Caesars. It lacks customer service, needs a facelift, and is definitely dated.",3,0,0

The spa is exceptional.

What I still never got an answer about was the over $900.00 in credit card authorizations that were on my card for over 5 days. We checked out 06\/06\/14 and I still have one authorization on my card. I am continually told that ""it will drop off"", ""there is nothing we can do about it now"", ""oh, I am not certain how that came to be."". Our room was comp'd and yes, I understand the original authorization for $200.00 for incidentals and the $28.00 daily resort fee. They were in crazy individual amounts ($134.95, $21.25, etc.)

Same thing happened when we dined in Mesa in this hotel on 06\/05\/14. We charged our dinner, which was $194.00 before tip. Our bill with tip came to $244.00. Our card was authorized for both amount. The charge of $244.00 was officially charged to our card on 06\/09\/14. 

As of this morning, the hotel authorization and the mesa grill authorization (for $194.00) are still on my card.

Really? No one in a multi-billion dollar establishment can explain this to me? Not the front desk, the VIP front desk or the accounting office?

Went to a little Mexican eatery at Caesars Palace.  My husband almost ate a rusty industrial staple, that was in his black beans.  My husband bit into it and his face dropped when he pulled it out and identified it as a large industrial staple.  I quickly went and spoke to an employee of the eatery- telling them what was found.  They told me to wait at the table for the proper people to arrive (to record the incident).  My husband wanted to leave right then and go to the ER to get a tetanus shot.  I was upset\/shocked and wanted to speak to someone... 45 MINUTES LATER... I start really looking around.. and noticing something strange.  There are three men around us... sitting at tables alone.. AND THEN I REALIZE THEY ARE FILMING US!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THEY ACTUALLY were sitting there for the past- who knows how long FILMING US with their camera phones.....  I WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I said to one of the men YOU GET ME SOMEONE NOW!!  All three men scattered like cockroaches.  Within 2 mins someone was there to take a report.  I said why were there men video taping us for the last 45 mins?!?!  The man said he didn't know- it was part of security...  What a terrible experience.  Horrible..

Though we had initially booked a room in the Forum Tower, which I had heard was a lengthy suitcase drag from the front desk, we wound up being upgraded to the newly renovated Augustus Tower due to our room not being prepared upon our arrival.  Our new space provided a luxurious experience that included dual flat-screen TVs (one in the bathroom), a jacuzzi tub, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountain show, a large sitting area, and more.  The room was extremely clean and well-kept.  Plus, the beds were very comfortable.

While the hotel was large and involved a substantial effort to navigate, I found it much more inviting and less overwhelming than the MGM Grand, where I had stayed a few years back.  The Forum Shops provided access to high-class shopping, decadent restaurants, and enjoyable entertainment.  The pool area was ridiculously amazing!  When we first stepped out onto the patio, we were amazed by the large pool that loomed in front of us.  On the first afternoon, we parked ourselves adjacent to this crowded venue.  However, before heading back inside later that day, I did some exploring and discovered that there were several other pools laying just behind the main attraction, including one with swim-up blackjack tables.  So, we made sure to enjoy those additional sections on the following day.  The staff at the pool was extremely welcoming, and the cocktail list was spectacular.  My Cranberry Mojito included a bunch of ripe berries and fresh mint sprigs.  It was incredibly refreshing and addicting!  There was also a pool party occurring in a blocked off section of the yard that we could not see, but could definitely hear.  We decided not to participate, but it seemed like the party-goers were enjoying themselves.

All in all, Caesars Palace provided all of the standard amenities and more, without being as hectic and stressful as the other large casinos on the Strip.  This old classic had been revamped and ready to take on even the trendiest of hotels.",0,0,0

This suite was based on the fictional one in the movie ""Rain Man"".  Per the Las Vegas Sun, the suite in ""The Hangover"" was also partly based on this room.  It's on the 69th floor (top floor) of the Forum Tower.  The suite is bi-level, and has up to 4 bedrooms (if you use the connecting neighboring rooms).  We used one of the connecting rooms, so we had 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.
 
The living room is huge.  It has a circular sofa on both sides, and a 52"" HDTV in the middle of the room that revolves 360 degrees.  There is a great 2-story view of the Strip.  There are speakers built into the ceilings and walls on both floors, and you can attach your IPod and blast your music through-out the entire suite.  The TV also has access to both DirecTV and Dish Network, and there's also a Blu-Ray player in the room.
 
There is a fancy remote that controls all the lighting (different moods), and the curtains.  The suite also has a dining table and kitchen area.  The bedrooms on the top level are huge, and have luxurious bathrooms.  There are even TVs built into the bathroom mirrors.  Because you need to be able to watch SportsCenter while you are shaving.
 
The Suite is just awesome.  We got numerous comments from other riders when we hit the 69 button on the elevator.  One girl even jokingly accused me of trying to impress her by hitting that button.  A few other people asked us for tours.  The list rate on the room is $6,400 a night but you can easily get it for much cheaper if you gamble a lot.  This room is ideal for a bachelor party, as you can easily fit up to 20 people in the Suite.",3,1,1

***The Palm (Steakhouse) restaurant is in Caesar's forum shops (best to make a reservation)  It's a great steak house, but very expensive.  If you go for a late lunch and order the Power Lunch you get soup or salad + entree + dessert for about 1\/2 - 1\/3 of the dinner price.  Great deal.

I had requested a non-smoking room when I made the reservation and asked again for a non-smoking room when I checked in at the registration desk. I was handed the keys, walked to my room, opened the door, and knew immediately that there had been heavy smoking for quite some time in the room. It was rancid with smoke. 

I called immediately to ask to be moved to a non-smoking room and was told that I was IN a non-smoking room! When I insisted that this clearly was not the case. the front desk then stated that I was in a ""smoking optional"" room, meaning that when the hotel runs out of smoking rooms, they place smokers there. They don't admit that the hotel tries to tell guests that these are non-smoking rooms when they are not. Do they think that we are idiots? That we can't smell smoke? That insulting out intelligence is a good strategy? 

The front desk said that they would send up someone with keys to a new ""smoking optional"" room immediately in the hope that it would be at least less rancid. 1\/2 hour later, no one had appeared, so I had to call a second time. This time, I was told that I would be moved to a true non-smoking room, but again, no one appeared for 1\/2 hour, so I called a third time. Within 15 minutes, I was finally moved to a non-smoking room. 

The room was fine. The TV was not....it didn't work. By this time, since I had arrived at the hotel at 8pm and then had to wait 1 1\/4 hours to get into a true non-smoking room, I called for room service for dinner instead of going out. The person who delivered the food called the hotel engineer for me to get the TV fixed. At least, the room server tried to do so but ended up waiting on the phone for almost 15 minutes, merely waiting for someone in engineering to pick up the phone. It was at this point the server mentioned to me that Caesar's Palace had just been awarded four stars and that this should not be happening in a four star hotel. I agree. Someone made a mistake. This does not perform like a four star hotel.",1,0,0

With that being said, Caesars Palace was not the best nor the worst hotel I've stayed at on the strip. 

My friends caught it on a sale, which is probably the only time I would pay ""that much"" money for the quality of room we stayed in. The hotel itself was HUGE, a maze, but very swanky and regal. I love that ""The Hangover"" was filmed here. Made for a good joke on my instagram. :) The walk to the registration desk, although can't be helped in a gigantic hotel such as Caesars, was long and being that I'm one of those ""money-saving"" girls who brings a cooler for cheaper drinks throughout my trip, it was not a pleasant experience bringing all that with us, up and down hallways and elevators. Of course I could've gone with valet and had them take it up to the room, but I didn't feel like tipping them (again, maybe the ""cheap"" girl inside of me, but hey, every penny counts in Sin City.)

However, I will commend the valet\/bell desk staff. They were all friendly and easy to deal with. They have a lot of people coming in and out of that hotel, but it was extremely organized and efficient when we used valet when checking our bags in to bring down. 

Back to the beginning though, the registration desk... I don't know if the lady was on a long end of her shift, I didn't note her name, when I probably should have. She was not the most pleasant to deal with when checking in. When you're the first or second impression, I feel that she could have been more friendly. Straight-faced and stern, she confused my friend about the deposit, as she told us separate charges charged for two nights... But it was just the one deposit for two nights. It was my friends' birthday weekend, and she didn't offer anything or suggest anything, which if I were in hospitality would probably offer or harbor the information just in case we asked. Instead it was a long silence while we checked-in and we were on our way to the room.

Also, when my other friends checked-in they got different treatment than we did. They were upgraded for free to a junior suite, however, our views of what it should be were sort of different. Although a very nice room, complete with jacuzzi tub and extra bathroom (?), padded headboard, and a Keurig machine, wasn't super impressive. The four of them had to cram in with a brought in full size roller bed, and king size bed, even if it looked like my queen bed at home. Nice view of the pool. When we called to inquire about upgrading, or trying to understand why they got the free upgrade when we didn't, it was kind of a ""you can deal with it"" attitude from the staff, and they blamed our booking.com reservation, even if my friend that received the upgrade did the same thing. Unfair treatment without compensation, or a sympathetic attitude, not hospitable, if you ask me. 

When arriving to the room, long hallway again with the walk, the cooler, our bags, I pretty much had welts in my hands from carrying everything. But, walking in the room, I wasn't the most impressed. Two normal queen sized beds, like a normal room. Nothing regal about them for the price, it could've had a little more amenities.

The bathroom, I don't know about most, but I would expect that Caesars would take pride in their marble\/granite counters and sinks. There were cracks in both the counter and in the sink unusually. I don't know who partied in there previous, but it must've been some blunt trauma with something to make a crack that big. It was noticeable after a few times in the bathroom. I felt as though I was in a mini pool when I took a shower, the drain was not the best, probably needs a good cleaning. The extra jet spouts in the shower (kind of weird placements...) had lime all over them, so the cleaning is sub-par, but since I didn't use them, I can forego some of that critique.

The pools were okay, I'm not sure why but when we went we were probably only there for an hour before it closed. I'm not sure if there was an event but the water was warm and there was ample space for people and their towels. 

If I had to compare my sleep in Caesars versus other hotels, I would rank Caesars last. The beds were uncomfortable and the sheets seemed a little rough. I'm not asking to sleep on a cloud, but it'd be nice if an expensive hotel invested in something a little bit better than a low thread count and cushier bed. 

Alright, well rant over, Caesars is great with amenities, not to mention a cool food court (Earl of Sandwich when drunk is amazing.) Overall, the stay wasn't bad, but there were some things that did not make it the best hotel on the strip, hence a 3-star rating. I wouldn't pay a high price to stay here again unless it was in a penthouse and I had money to spend in-house to win some cash. But again, I guess that's Vegas, baby!",0,0,0

Now however, it's gone from being a sexy young star to your tight fisted grandma whose more intent on keeping her eye on you than making you feel welcome. 
The snacks in the room's mini bar are outrageous! $13 m&m's, $13 for 2 pods of Kerig coffee, $8 for 16 oz waters etcetera. All of the food items sitting atop the food tray have sensors attached to them, so that if you accidentally knock them over or lift them up to take a closer look before deciding to take out a loan to buy one, you are automatically charged for them. This is the same with the refrigerated items. And if you try to store your own waters in the refrigerator you will be charged. You can pay to rent a refrigerator if you like. 
There was a time when coffee and tea came standard in a Vegas hotel room same as most other non LV rooms, but Caesars Palace has really taken on the role of a miserly old skin flint who charges you a horrible markup. It has become so overpriced and underwhelming I think it's truly time to look elsewhere.",1,2,0

Review #33:
wowza, where do I start?; first of all, wear comfortable shoes if you're really going to explore Caesars - I walked pretty much non-stop for 2 hours, and still didn't see quite all of it; ascending the escalator to the conference rooms is like the stairway to heaven, and there are 2 sprawling levels of rooms; this is shopping paradise, both near the casino area and the Forum Shoppes - which are not just shops, it's a freaking huge upscale mall that goes on forever!; there are Roman statue replicas everywhere, which the tourists just seem to love snapping pictures of; the hotel check-in lobby is truly impressive, and has not 1, but 2 very nice adjacent lobby bars; Nobu restaurant is as chic & cool as you would expect, and now there is a separate Nobu Hotel tower; best craft brew bet = disappointingly mediocre, though Gordon Ramsay' s Pub has a solid (but expensive) on-tap list; possibly a better bet is the outdoor Serendipity 3, where it's a buck or two less per beer and the selection is surprisingly decent",2,0,1

Bellagio and Paris to one side and the Mirage and Venetian on the other with the new High Roller obsevation wheel right across the street.  Perfect if you want to be able to walk to all the action.  The staff is friendly, there are great restaurants and the gaming is great.  It would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our room was beat up abit.  There were big scratches on the TV console, a big burn mark on the sofa where someone had set down a hot iron and there were about 30 of those plastic things that that are attached to a shirt that holds a price tag on our carpet.  I know it was not vaccumed when we arrived.  The only reason we didn't move rooms was because we had a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  The rooms are large and well equiped with TV and whirlpool in the bathroom and steam showers.  Mini bar didn't work either, it was hot and when we arrived there was a bottled water missing and of course they charged us for it, even though it was never replaced from the previous people.  I guess it's our fault for not notifying the front desk upon arrival.",0,0,0

It was my first time staying at Caesar's and I expected it to be beautiful. It's not that the hotel wasn't nice, but there are so many nicer hotels on the strip for the same price. It was your basic room: shower, jacuzzi tub, 2 beds, flat screen TV and mini bar. 

The Caesar's casino area was also pretty outdated. Not to mention the setup of the casino felt too cramped. I feel more comfortable gambling at other casinos where it's more open. 

The only plus in my opinion is Caesar's is the location of many fine dining restaurants, shops, Serendipity 3 and the Bacchanal buffet. For those reasons I will definitely be back, but just to visit and not actually stay here.

I can't say enough good things about choosing Caesars Palace for my wedding. The hotel itself is magnificent of course, you can read plenty about how beautiful the grounds are, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the staff is amazing. I wanted to talk specifically about how great it was to work with Lindsay, the wedding coordinator, and how nice the Venus Garden was for a venue. Lindsay was completely on top of all communications and completely accommodating and so nice. I couldn't have imagined a better person to handle my nervous-wreck self and hardcore need to be super planned. You won't be disappointed!  The packages are very reasonably priced for what you get. They change prices often so I recommend you look at the website to find out the current rates. The in-house photographer was OK, definitely serviceable, but I did get out of venue photography.  The floral was top notch, loved my bouquet, it was exactly what I wanted and very decent prices. The venue itself was the main draw. The Venus Garden felt secluded, had gorgeous greenery, and photographed amazingly. My 47 guests fit perfectly in the seating. The music was perfect (pianist included in the package). The officiant was perfect. I just can't recommend it enough, if you are considering this venue, do it!!!",0,0,0

First, we had to pay $60 to have 2 extra people in the room (four of us girls decided to share), for a total of $219 per night plus taxes.  A woman in Reservations that I spoke to was very nice; however, the hotel messed up our reservation.  I selected the ""check-in via text"" and two of the four of us went straight to the bellhop who took our luggage up and gave us four room key cards.  A few hours later roommate #3 (who hadn't gotten my text about checking in with the bellhop) showed up and said that the front desk gave her another 4 key cards (which invalidated the 4 that they gave me), informed her that we hadn't checked in, and had her on a separate reservation with all charges on HER card.  Peeved, I called the front desk and told the story not once but TWICE to a young lady who obviously didn't understand so I demanded that she put her supervisor on the phone, who at least had a half a brain in his head.  So that finally got straightened out.

The good:
1. The bathroom was huge and had both a tub and a separate shower.  You could have put a queen-sized air mattress in there and slept 2 more people.
2. The seminar I was attending was in the hotel, so I didn't have to go outside in the 100+ degree heat very often.

The bad:
1.  Our chartered bus was not allowed to drop us off anywhere near the hotel entrance.  The driver had to park somewhere else and we had to schlep our bags and ourselves for quite a distance in the heat.
2. I requested feather-free pillows when I checked in at 3 p.m., at 10 p.m. there was no sign of them.
3. Despite there being four of us on the reservation (AND the extra fee paid, I might add), there were not enough sets of towels until we called, twice.
4. There was no electrical plug anywhere near the desk for a laptop (except behind the entertainment center where the TV was plugged in).
5. No mirrors anywhere except in the bathroom.
6. No hooks for toiletry bags in the bathroom except one on the back of the door.
7. No shelves for extra sets of towels.
8. No shelf in the shower for shampoo and other toiletries.
9. The air vents were filthy like they hadn't been cleaned in a year.

The ugly:
1. Two acquaintances told me they booked a room at the Westin, with one of their Heavenly beds, for a mere $81 per night.",1,0,0

They originally put us in a room at the end of the hall. Seriously, couldn't get any further than our room. We asked to be placed in a room closer to the elevator and it took 2 whole days before we were able to move. We originally made the call, they told us they would call us back and never did. We called back the first day and they told us we couldn't move until the following day and they would call to let us know. No call was received so we called them again and got it figured out. They moved us to another non-smoking room, but it reeked 
of cigarette smoke! We went back down to the front desk and finally got a new room. The new one was good.

Our first stay in 2012 was in the Octavius Tower and generally positive. In hindsight, it was only good because we were lucky we didn't have a need to experience customer service.

To go through the positives first:
+attached to Forum Shops
+good dining choices plus the Bacchanal Buffet
+plenty of free, secure self parking
+the majority of the newer towers have marble baths and jetted tubs
+location on the Strip

Now to the unacceptable:
-HORRID customer service!

We made reservations for the Palace Tower this time--still a relatively newer tower. Our check in representative made sure we were comfortable by putting us on the lowest floor next to a service closet. In addition, the top layer of the mattress in this room was tearing, exposing the coils. It should be noted, the beds are better at Excalibur.

Now onto the (lack of) customer service....

We were awakened one morning at 6 am to the sound of hammering and drilling. The hammering was so loud and persistent that we initially thought one of our neighbors was pounding on the wall. We called the front desk and the lady we spoke with told us she would send someone to investigate. 30 min later the sound was still occurring and we had no follow up from the front desk. We called back and were told that they were ""looking into it."" Sound continued and no follow up all day. The sounds returned at 7 pm. We called the front desk again and demanded to know what was going on and how long it would last. The guy we spoke to said that repairs were taking place and that there was nothing they could do. 

No follow up, ETA, apology, or offer to change rooms extended by any staff. CP makes it pretty clear that they just don't give a *%#&$* about guests. For 5 star service, look to Wynn, Bellagio, or Cosmopolitan instead.",3,2,0

His excuse ""this happens all of the time and you just have to deal with it.""  While we fully understood that this issue could be from the outside site the gentleman that checked us in was beyond rude.  He rolled his eyes at us several times and acted as if we were a complete inconvenience to him.  We also ended up having to pay for our room all over again in order to stay there that evening, despite having the confirmation from the other website.  As of today we still have not been fully credited for the money we dished out, one week later.

Since it was our first time staying at Caesar's though they gave us an upgrade. This automatically means I'm having a good experience.

Only downfall: If it's your first time staying here, it's pretty easy to get lost.  The hotel is HUGE so make sure to ask for a map :)",1,0,0

The room was complementary so this review is based exclusively on the room and does not factor in the cost that would usually be incurred. The Augustus tower is located on the left side of the lobby - a plus - since you don't need to hall your luggage across the casino to get to the elevators. The room was spacious, must have been 400 square feet, with a shower and a jacuzzi and separate latrine. Caesar's is an older property in some places you can see its age, the shower was leaking into the bathroom floor. In addition, the latrine was not ventilated, so depending on what and how much you ate the day before, it can be an interesting experience. The good thing is that there is a phone in the latrine, so in case you need to make reservations, call the airline, check on credit card bills etc, you can take care of it while in the act. 4 stars. Highly recommended for any Total Rewards member.",0,1,0

Granted, it was for business, and CES on top of that. Still, I've been much happier at other hotels like Wynn and MGM at that same crazy time of year.

I was sharing a room with a colleague, so we were a little bit disturbed that there was a window between the bathroom and our room with two double beds. Who gets a double room and wants a bathroom with a window?? We're clearly not sweethearts on a wild romantic getaway.

The TV was a late 90's RCA and broken too. No desk. No couch. Ancient heating\/cooling system. We requested a room change once my colleague discovered we could hear every word coming from our neighbors next door.

The new room was a little more updated, but felt kind of stale. Still no desk. I was not impressed as a business traveler and would have been even less impressed if I was staying on my own dime. I'm sure a premium room would have been comfortable and palace-ish, but my accommodations were certainly not fit for a king, let alone a tired website editor just trying to get some work done.",3,1,0

From the Forum Shops, shows, a range of dining options to their exquisite spa and trendy pools, it gives you everything you need for your Vegas experience without even leaving the resort.

We stayed here over the weekend in the new Julius towers. They are modern, cozy & no smokey smells. The deluxe beds room was big and offers a keurig. Bathroom was spacious, granite counters with 2 sinks. The shower was big and has two shower heads. The beds felt like clouds!

Great central location. You are right next to the Bellagio and across from the Linq & Cromwell. Easy access to more shopping, dining and going out. 

The Forum shops offer everything from high end to H&M. Even great restaurants like Carmine's. We even got our makeup done at Chanel before heading out for dinner and a show. 

The one thing you MUST do if you come to Vegas, even if you don't stay at Caesars and get a Qua Spa pass. It's reasonably priced and you get access to all the spa pool and steam rooms. The spa is separated by gender so you don't have to worry about covering up. There are showers and vanities with all the tools you need to get ready (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, deodorant, blow dryer, curling irons, etc). Also lockers are provided for you, make sure you lock them correctly or ask for help. The spa is stocked with waters, teas, juices and snacks. The tea room was awesome! Stocked with Art of Tea blends and even a Water Shot bar to help with any of your body needs.

Addressing some of the ridiculous negative reviews...sounds like a lot of poors overshot their spending capabilities. Yeah, if you stay in the Roman Tower it is going to be dated.

When you walk through the grounds at Caesars, the amazing ""Garden of the Gods"" pool, and inside the casino, you are immediately struck by the opulence in the gorgeous statues and marble columns and accents throughout the property. This all ends once you get to your room. We paid extra on expedia for an upgraded room (jacuzzi). Originally, they put us in the Palace Tower on the 6th floor. Upon entering the room, I felt like an extra in the movie ""Casino"".- very 1974 feel to the room. Very ""old vegas"". The decor looked very old, torn, retro, dark, farty. The rug was absolutely awful. The pattern looked like big roaches crawling all over the rug. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever laid on, it was like CAMPING on the floor of the forest with no sleeping bag. Awful. My back killed me when I woke up. I woke up early due to someone HAMMERING loudly, and it continued into the afternoon. The view was also laughable. We had a completely obstructed view of the pool area. There was a huge statue in front of the window and all we could see was the statues ass. Lol. Add to that, that the windows were filthy. If there was a good view, we wouldnt have been able to see it anyway. Lol. There were towels in the bathroom with holes in them, and the plastic jacuzzi tub looked like something out of a motel 6. 
Then we went downstairs to complain about the decor and condition of the room. The desk clerk encouraged us to pay and ADDITIONAL $150 to get an upgrade to the new Augustus towers. She assured us it was completely different from the room we had and it was brand new and gorgeous. After much contemplation, since we had already paid extra for the room we had, I went for the additional money to get into the Augustus Tower. We get all the way over there, and that room is THE EXACT SAME ROOM just a lil bit longer, had a tv in the bathroom, and a view of the bellagio fountains... Not worth $150 to us to be in what looks like the same room- Down to the carpet, comforters, etc. So we go downstairs again and ask to DOWNGRADE to our original room and get the $ back. They grant us this but are kinda rude about it telling us the WONT move us again since this was the 3rd move on DAY 1...Still unhappy about the room, and the service, we called Expedia to rescue us. ********** I dont know who knows this- but if you book through an Expedia or a Travelocity, etc you are buying a guarantee. NEVER BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THE HOTEL!!! If you dont like your room, or your hotel, or housekeeping doesnt come, or your air doesnt work, or its somehow not up to par, you can call who you booked through and ask to change hotels. We did this and expedia was willing to do it. They just had to get an ok from Caears. Caesars would not let us out. We were being held hostage there. Such BS. Finally after a day and a half fighting with the hotel through expedia, they let us out of the last night in Vegas and we got another hotel. Such a mess. They are supposed to refund us for the last night, and as we just got back last night, we are still waiting for that $$. Gonna have to begin the fight again from home now. Would NEVER stay there again. They pissed me off so badly, I spent 0 ZERO money in their hotel, casino and I skipped Qua. I didnt want to give them another dime. 
It seems that they are known for their pools and thats it. If that is enough for you, if you arent in the room often, and if your running around gambling, that may be a fine hotel for you. But after we have stayed in all the nicer hotels in Vegas, this was a  huge disappointment. Not at all luxurious or what we paid for. All their money clearly went into the lobby and pool area and not the rooms.

Granted, the check in\/out process took longer than necessary but I get it, it was a busy holiday weekend afterall. 


1. beautiful resort. It's HUGEEEEEE and everything you need\/want is available here under one roof. I'm a sucker for theming and this is an all out Roman Empire.
2. centrally located on The Strip. Perfect prime spot.
3. plenty of restaurants to choose from that fits all budgets.
4. Forum Shops. Again, stores that fit all budgets. You got your bebe, Marciano, Bath & Body Works, Sephora and Victoria's Secret. But you also got your Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co and Christian Louboutin. Now THIS....is shopping heaven here. 
-large casino floor. Table minimum starts at $10. 
5. Five beautiful pools. Never once have I felt it too crowded and chaotic, even during Labor Day weekend. (separate review on the pool.)
6. Different towers to choose from....whatever your budget is, I'm sure there's a tower for you. Top two towers are: Augustus and their newest, Octavius. Those two are literally right next to each other. Closest to the front desk area, pools and Bacchanal Buffet....but furthest away from the self parking garage and forum shops. Their ""new renovated"" Julius Tower used to be where all the Classic Rooms are at.
(((((NOTE))))): I've stayed in both Augustus and Octavius before and their rooms are identical. I'm not sure why some reviews are complaining about the Octavius and preferring Augustus over that. Literally...the only difference with staying at Octavius is a 2 minute longer walk to get out of the tower. Wifi was a bit spotty during my stay....weak reception, only had one reception bar. Not sure if it was the tower, my phone carrier (T-Mobile) or a little bit of both.
7. this property is pet friendly, with an additional cost of course. They don't limit you to just your service dog, family pets are welcome. 
8. If you're into the nightclub scene, Caesars hosts one of the newest, most popular nightclub here in Vegas; Omnia Nightclub. 

And for those complaining about resort fees and how come the none of the rooms have a microwave, sorry but that's just how Las Vegas is. Almost EVERY resort on The Strip WILL charge you a daily resort fee. You're lucky Caesars Properties don't charge you for parking (yet). They don't provide microwaves because of liability issues and there's usually not a refrigerator in the room. Why? Because there just isn't. FYI, a mini bar is not a refrigerator either. The properties on The Strip isn't a Holiday Inn. If having a refrigerator is that big of a concern to you, then don't stay on The Strip. No resort\/hotel will provide that for you free of charge.

If opportunity arises again, I would definitely have another staycation here, hands down, no hesitation.",26,17,26

It is hard to rate or generalize such a big hotel so I'll try to be fare.

Staying in the new towers is extremely worth your money! 
Why?

- It is still cheaper than Wynn, Bellagio & venetian
- You get a bigger room, very specious, open & fresh, clean carpet, extremely comfortable beds!
- Awesome contemporary design & style, very impressing furniture & vibe
- Full HD flat screen TV's (in the bathroom too)
- Nice mini bar & safe
- Best view in Vegas of the Bellagio fountain & Eiffel tower at Paris (Ask for right side or you'll be stuck w\/boring view)
- Great efficient service
- Best SPA in Vegas: Big, fresh, relaxing best experience I ever had!
- Efficient room service & cleaning team
- The best Valet (driving them crazy 6 times a day! They already knew me by my full name!)
- Forum shops are great!
- Centrally located
- Great bars!


Also:
- We lost our keys, got exchanged, had security escorting us to the room
- Ordered one extra room across ours out of the blue (needed privacy) no problem! 
-  We were charged $80 for few calls from our room! Check out rep waved it for me!

On top of that, they didn't tell us that they sold out of the Double Bay Suites, and one of our rooms wasn't even ready in time. Can you imagine a bunch of girls crammed into one room.

I have stayed in all of the towers and there are definitely some towers better than others. The rankings go:

1) Augustus... one of the newer towers the best part about the Augustus tower is the location.  Above the Qua Spa and Gym and near the front of the hotel the location and quality of rooms makes this tower my faovrite.

2) Octavius... little far from the majority of the property but nicest rooms are found here.

3) Nobu... cool new hip and clean.  Center of Casino is nice too.

4) Palace... by the pool, large rooms.

5) Forum... nothing too special

1864) Roman... do not book a room here unless u want the cheapest thing possible. Very outdated and not as clean as rest of rooms.

The restaurant selections are great at Caesars and the center of the strip location is wonderful.  

Can get expensive but there are not many better classic places to stay at on the strip.",6,3,3

They have more table games in the back end of their casino on the way to the shops, but the layout isn't that great to me. They have the forum shops located in the end of the casino. The forum shops have some free entertainment and food places as well. They have some shows there. I think when we went, Jerry Seinfeld was there. But it usually is Shania Twain or Elton John. They also have another show Absinthe there as well.

They have Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, which is decent. Serendipity is also in the front of the casino next to the strip.

caesars is really great. i love the augustus tower and on booked weekends if you are diamond and they fully booked when u've already had reservations, they upgrade you to the biggggggg suites!

caesars service is really great. they are owned by harrahs entertainment. i like harrahs entertainment better than mgm because they have a tier system with their players.

they treat the bigger players with more perks. for instance, u dont have to wait in line and more thing are available to you. at MGM casinos, i have to wait for valet for like an hour! where as harrahs, they bring the big players cars out first. now thats service! you know if you are dropping $ in the casino, you mean business.... not like some families who are on vacation with nothing to do... you kno they have all the time in the world!

baccaratt lounge is great here. this is the only place that i have ever seen a 24 player run.... some of the pit bosses are assholes but all the dealers are great and the lounge service is top notch. 

this is my hotel of choice. caesars recognizes who you are if you are somebody.

I got the 24-hour buffet card at my stay during Vegas.

If you are looking for long lines, little selection, and bad service - this is the place to go!

Come early for lunch and line up. I was a bit anxious to get in and try the food since there were so many people in line. Oh, was I wrong.

Highlight:
- Lox (raw, cured smoked salmon)

Un-Highlight:
- Service (took forever to be seated when there are so many seats open)
- The food looks horrendous 1-hour into the buffet. People are savages, and Cesar's Palace reminds you of this.
- Stomach-ache (probably from the Lox)
- No good seafood!

Stayed there this past weekend booked through the Hotel Tonight app. Got a basic room in the old Forum tower. The room was nice, bigger than expected, the bed was amazing!!! But like other reviewers have stated the room was poorly lit. The bathroom was very nice\/pretty. Had two shower heads, a regular one and a rainfall like one. 

The main reason I'm giving a review on the low side was because of our check in experience. Hotel Tonight stated that check in was at 4, we tried to check in at 3 and we're told the room wasn't ready yet. Was told to hang around the casino & they would call my cell at 4 when the room was ready. It got to be 4:30 & I had not gotten a call. So went to the front desk & was told that because I asked for a nonsmoking room it would be a little while longer....I never asked for that. When I explained that to the front desk employee (the same guy who told us the room wasn't ready in the 1st place) he said oh that's right & asked us if we had picked up the keys. What?! We don't have a room how are we supposed to have keys??Maybe he had been having a bad day or was on a bad trip or something but he was utterly confused & had no idea what was going on. My bf demanded that we speak to a different employee & that lady said our room had been ready all along. WTF! She didn't offer any apologies for the inconvenience and kind of made it seem like the situation was our fault. At that point I didn't even want to stay there anymore but once we got the room it was nice. 

Loved that the forum shops are attached and the pretty expansive casino. You won't have a problem finding a machine you like that's for sure. 

I just really didn't like the customer service, for being an upscale fancy expensive place that checkin in was totally unacceptable.",1,0,0

We went to the main pool around 11:30 am and it was packed, so we thought to check out the venus pool.  We got in for free and were taken to a large, white day bed at the side of the pool.  We were also brought out complimentary champagne and the server refused to accept a tip!  It was such a nice way to start our stay at Caesars!  We then purchased $65 pitchers of rock candy lemonade (not virgin), and it was amazing.  We ended up lounging by the pool for 6 hours.

I forget the exact numbers, but it was the best deal we could find. They also said it included an amenities package that gave us free WiFi, a tour of VIP facilities, entrance to a luxury pool, etc. Finding nothing better, we called back and booked it.

Come on, WE WOULD PAY $1,800 FOR THE SUITE BUT THEY COULDN'T COMP US $15 FOR WIFI!? And a $200 voucher is nothing! We had at least 5 guys staying. 

This whole ordeal took over an hour of our time, and HE NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR MAKING US WAIT. Heck, while we were in line, another guest was complaining that Caesars Palace screwed him over because they gave his room out to someone else. Being diabetic, he originally had a room with a fridge to hold his insulin, but Caesars Palace screwed up. THE GUY HAD TO GO GET HIS INSULIN SHOT AT THE URGENT CARE BECAUSE CAESARS PALACE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH THE PROMISED REFRIGERATOR!

We were so pissed we asked to cancel our reservation. We were going to find somewhere else to stay. The manager then had the nerve to say ""You know it's Memorial Day weekend right?"" Implying that we wouldn't be able to find living arrangements elsewhere. You know what Caesars Palace? WE'RE NEVER GOING TO STAY AT CAESARS PALACE EVER AND TELLING EVERYONE HOW YOU MISTREATED US!",4,0,1

For those of us who are older and with disabilities, there's a number of significant issues.  First is parking.  Self park is difficult to get to and when in the structure, there are no directions on the walls on where to park, what direction check-in is, etc.  Next you have to walk the entire length of the casino to get to the check in area.  Nothing like dragging your luggage over carpeting.  A number of stairs have no adjacent ramp.

Check in was mechanical and cold.  They did set us up in the Forum tower so we didn't have to walk as far to get out to the truck.

Probably like all the larger properties, there is a high ambient noise level which means most patrons have to shout at each other in the dining spots.  Speaking of dining, overpriced and mediocre quality.  They really gouge you if you try to be economical at the food court. The other thing is bad lighting transitions and no illuminated buttons in the elevators so you have to use your phone light to pick and choose.

The casino staff was friendly.  That got quashed when I got to my room and the key didn't work.  So at O'dark Thirty I got to wait 45 minutes with other frustrated guests trying to get their rooms and some sleep.  Woefully understaffed.

BTW wi-fi stinks.  It doesn't work in the Forum Shops because I found out that area isn't part of the resort.  So if it isn't part of the resort, don't act like it.  The Cigar Bar at the far end of the shop area is OK but doesn't have any draft taps.  Even there the ambient noise roar means you have to shout to be heard.",0,0,0

In general, I highly recommend Caesars as a place to stay.  It has a great location on the strip, the casino is nice, the pool is beautiful, PURE is right downstairs (though it's not my favorite club), and the mall attached is convenient for picking up forgotten items.

Next, this place doesn't nickel-and-dime you... it $5-and $10s you!  There's a bunch of ridiculously overpriced crap in the room, and the fridge is full of it (if you move something, you get charged)  There was a note saying you could ask housekeeping for a fridge.

I'd give them a negative star and beg people to tear it down, but the Forum shops are okay, and their concert venue is really nice, so I'll add a star for that.  Other than that, this place is overpriced and over-rated crap.

Their casino is awful.  Their machines have some of the lowest payouts in Vegas.  Their table games have some of the highest minimum bets on the strip, and their staff is snobbish and rude.  If you aren't laying down $100 per hand, then you are simply not worth their time. 

The last time I was there was about a year ago. I actually had one of their pit bosses SNEER at me when I asked if there were any $10 Blackjack tables available, and he told me me it might be best if I found a lower class hotel to play in.  EXCUSE ME?!?!  I was wearing dress pants and a polo at the time, so it's not like I was looking trashy...I was just waiting for my concert to start and wanting to blow $100 or $150 while I waited.

The hotel itself was probably considered really nice when it was built in 1962, but it is completely dated and tacky compared to anything else on the strip.  It looks like some 60 year old Persian guy went nuts with marble statues and gold spray paint. (Not trying to be racist, but that stereotype is the only way I can think to describe the absurd level of tacky)

Granted, my company booked\/comped for my room but still, I got way downgraded from last year's trip. I have nothing good to say about my recent experience. 

Unlike other tower rooms (ie. Palace Tower), here are things you should expect:
- Room is much smaller than other towers
- I got put in a room with no view of anything - oh, just a beautiful view of buildings and walls
- There are no plugs on night stand lamps. So ghetto. I couldn't even find any plugs behind the beds. The only closest plug is on the wall far away from the bed. 
- No bathrobes
- No jet tubs
- The so-called clock with iPhone plug and charger doesn't even charge my iPhone when plugged in
- Shower and bathtub water is sometimes cold even when you have it on ""Hot"". It turned cold while I was showering so imagine how I felt!
- Air controller is one of those old-school slider thingies rather than the modern controller with buttons to push to increase or decrease temperature
- There is NO desk for you to work on. How are you supposed to work on your laptop if you're here for work??

- Best of all, front desk informed me wrong information for shipping stuff. I had to order an urgent item online with a 2-day shipping. I called front desk to get shipping address information and they told me the address and said shipments would come to the Business Center and all I'd have to do is go there, show my ID and pick up the package. So I did that, and Business Center reps said that front desk always mixes up that info. In actuality, shipments come to their Parcel Center. They can call and have the package delivered to me anywhere in the hotel. Sounds great! OK let's do that! So the rep called the parcel center and let me speak with the guy on the phone. Turned out, my package was STILL at the USPS!! Apparently they don't deliver to the hotel!! WTF? I would have to actually go to USPS on Las Vegas Blvd to pick it up on MONDAY. I'm like ""Uhhm that's impossible. It's Saturday, I have to check out at 11am, and my flight home is 4pm. There is no way I can do that. So finally I was told to call the USPS back on Monday and arrange for the package to be forwarded to my address back home with a shipping fee! Geezussss!!! So much for Amazon prime 2-day shipping. Now I have to pay forwarding shipping fees!? What a nightmare!

This must've been one of my worst trips and stays in Vegas ever. That's why I'm giving 1 star. The only thing good about this hotel is the Payard because that's where I go every morning for my coffee and pastry. And maybe a couple of restaurants. That's it.",3,0,1

Caesars offers many types of hotel towers and I recommend the Nobu hotel! The Nobu hotel is modern, luxurious and so exclusive! 
I stayed in the Julius tower as well, I highly recommend to avoid this tower. 
I stayed in the Nobu Hotel which is the hotel version of the Nobu Restaurant. 
If you stay at Nobu, you get access to their exclusive lounge and gym which is on their 62th floor. You also get access to certain pools which is pretty cool.
The service at the front desk is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend to stay at this hotel for your Vegas stay because it's in the smack middle of the strip.

Besides the hotel talk, I recommend trying the Bacchanal buffet which is one of the best on the strip and to visit the Omnia night club.

So we dropped our luggage to the bell desk and did stuff on the strip.

We arrived at 3am, checked in and told us they were out of double beds. Single beds were the only thing available, they told us they will give us another room the next day with the double bed..... but for our trouble they will upgrade us to a deluxe room and will send us a roller-bed. 

Room was tiny and you just cannot compare with Venetian or Palazzo. BUT its understandable knowing the fact that Ceasars is an older hotel than the two. But i guess we were just spoiled by Palazzo with their awesome room.... 

It was 5am, roller-bed still haven't arrive. Called the front desk and they told us our ticket request is still in progress. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! We all fell asleep and woke up.......and guess what, roller-bed still not here!!! 

We went to the Palace Station and ate at the Oyster Bar..... Highly recommended to go and try it there, everything is so flavorful and yummy. Its our tradition to eat there everytime we are at vegas..... 

When we try to valet our car back at Ceasars, they told us since the lot is full and we r not a diamond or seven member, we had to go to the Colosseum valet to park our car.....whateva..... 

Went back to the room and called the front desk about our doublebed. Long story short, no doublebed room, no notes on our account about changing room.......if i want to talk to a manager, I had to come downstair and ask for them.... ARE YOU F*@&ing kidding me!!! What kind of service are they providing????? After I hung up on them, 2 minutes later......knock knock........rollerbed is here!!! After 15 f***ing hrs later. So bull@%*& 

We were ready to head home the next day, so we packed our bags and headed to the valet. When we walked out......our car was parked on the curb and it said valet was closed. We saw an employee and told them that was our car......they told us we parked at the wrong valet and there is a $20 fee for leaving the car overnite.... ARE YOU F*@&ing kidding me!!!

Check in is made really easy, you can also use their self-serve machine to make things go faster. Check out was also easy, but we had to wait in line for about an hour as others were having various issues with charges and such. 

The room we had was on the 22 floor, facing the pool, and it was gorgeous! The bathroom consisted of a shower, a hot tube, and was the size of a room itself! Super elegant, and newly remodeled. 

The only issue I had with this hotel is when we first arrived to our room it wasn't clean. The trash cans were full, and there was random wrappers and napkins around the floor. The beds and bathrooms were cleaned and made, but the remaining trash was a little frustrating. We called the front desk and they apologized. They gave us the option of getting a new room or having the cleaning services come clean our room within 5 minutes. We opted for the later, since we truly enjoyed our view. Downside, it took until the next morning to have someone come clean it which was really annoying.

Also, there is a fridge in the room that is stocked with a bunch of beverages and snacks. It's all sensor detected, so if you remove an item and put it back, it'll still charge you upon checkout. You can appeal the charge, but it's just a hassle. I wish they made bigger signs that mentioned that, rather than super fine print.

To start from the moment I checked in the level service was great! The lady who checked me in was extremely nice and personable she asked what clubs I wanted to go to I told her. As she handed me the keys to the room she also gave me passes to a few clubs for friends and I. 

Once checked in I must say it was a pretty long walk to the room, but well worth it. The room was spacious and the beds were so comfortable! I mean I didn't want to get out of the bed. My friends arrived later as I flew and they drove. My friends soon arrived with a bell hop in tow. The bell hop offered to get ice for our room and anything else needed.

Caesars is kind of the center of the Vegas universe.  They get big names at the Colosseum (ok, Celine Dion and Shania Twain, doesn't thrill me, but they seem to pack them in), they have the forum shops (high end mall), a high end spa (Qua), top notch restaurants  and I suppose you can gamble here too :)  Caesars is the kind of place you can walk in one day and not leave until 3 days later.  That is good and bad.  It has it all, but it is also incredibly large, with a complex floor plan and it takes a lot of hoofing it to get from one end to the other.  

Now, one of the reasons we picked Caesars this time is they didn't have resort fees.  I, like everyone else, detest the useless resort fees that Vegas has begun shoving down our throats.  Caesars didn't used to charge them, however I heard as of 3\/1\/13 they will be charging away - so be forewarned!  

We had planned to do the spa and had heard the Augustus Tower was the the newer of the buildings and the spa is in the same tower so we thought we were being smart by booking a deluxe room there. Plus it has it's own check in desk so you don't have to wait in those long lines at the main reception area.  At any rate, they decided to upgrade us (yay!), however we got put in the Palace Tower.  Now we had the single nicest room I have ever stayed at in Vegas, but the PT is SO far from everything I wished I had brought more comfy shoes.  

The Palace Tower suite (2802) we got was on one of the Penthouse floors. The bank of elevators were way out of the way so they weren't busy and you had added security of needing a key to get to the floor.  The suite itself had 3 full bathrooms w\/tvs (which was totally excessive), wet bar, desk, sitting area with TV, dining room, a bed room with a King size bed, a couple of arm chairs, another TV and then of course the double closets, jacuzzi spa and 2 person shower.  It was insane!  I mean, incredibly nice! The only complaint (other than the walk) was that there was zero view.  We basically could see other Caesars Towers (this isn't that big of a deal though).

The hallway to our room on the 69th floor had some water dripping from the ceiling, the hotel jimmy rigged it with a plastic tube that drained the leak into a plastic bucket and they had a fan blowing air towards our room probably to dry the carpet. The hallway smelled like an old moldy cabin. 

When we get into our room a couple doors down away from the whole mess outside, we start noticing the smell creep into our room as well. So we decide to call front desk and asked for a room change. 
I was pretty disappointed at how they handled it after that. They put me on hold for about 15 minutes. Then they asked me to leave the room immediately and told me the other room would be available after an hour or so. I asked if we could just wait in the current room while they prep the other cause we were really tired but they said no and told us we can bring our stuff to the bell desk and wait there until we get a text saying the room was ready. 
 We take what seemed like the longest trek ever down to the bell desk, checked our bags in and after 30 minutes waiting around I got fed up and got in line to ask the front desk if the room was ready and found out it was. I'm so glad I took initiative to ask because who knows if they would have ever texted me. After all this, we find that our room has been downgraded from being on the highest floor (69th) to the bottom floor (51st) of the forum tower. our view went from a corner view of the strip to a view of side walls of the building.

We stayed at the Augustus Tower a few years ago and it was great. Magnificent room and view of the pool. 

This time we decided to give the Octavious Tower a try. We had 4 rooms four out group. Street view and not quite as nice of rooms. We arrived at about 1.30pm and the rooms were ready. Like all hotels, on the day of check in if your room is ready before the stated time of the reservation, in this case, 4pm, they give you your keys a couple of hours early. But here's the twist. Cesar's had found a new way to squeeze every possible cent out of its customers. They now charge $30 if you want to check in an hour or two before 4pm. 

The rooms have very few amenities that 5 star hotels usually offer. No bathrobes, just basic shampoo and lotion. Definitely no mouthwash, etc. 

There is also no soundproofing. You can hear every word the strangers in the room next door are saying in normal conversation.And of course, you hear their TV. 

The Buffet is good but the most expensive on the Strip at $60 per person.  And if you want coffee from the Starbucks downstairs expect to pay about $6 for a tall and 50c for a cup of ice water (tall) that is free and whatever size you want at any other Starbucks not in Cesar's.",10,2,4

If it was not a Vegas hotel it would be a solid 5 stars but given the newer hotels that have gone up in Vegas, the competition is stiff. Caesars is an older spot that lacks some of the decor and nightlife that the other spots have to offer. Caesars caters to an older crowd nowadays, which I can understand because for those who were frequenting vegas 15 years ago, CP was the place to stay. But don't worry, for the young folk there is plenty to do. 

Caesars is a great place to stay if you get an upgraded room. The standard rooms are just any standard hotel room but the upgraded rooms are nice and comfy with a spacious bathroom, vanity, and jacuzzi. Comfy, clean, and spacious. Wi-Fi is not included. 

The lago buffet has been replaced by bachannal, which is supposedly one of the best buffets in vegas right now. Although my favorite places to stay in vegas are the palazzo and the wynn\/encore, Caesars is a great place to stay if you dont mind being away from the hot night life spots. There are the forum shops (which I LOVE), many lounges, great restaurant options, and of course the best spa in vegas QUA (45$ day pass). They also have a nice pool which is heated to 86 degrees in the winter. The casino is not my favorite but it has every slot\/table you would expect. They have a Pussycat lounge blackjack table area with live girls dancing. It is an awkward setting but definitely entertaining. The nightlife here is definitely not trendy or the hot place to be right now. They have many lounges and their big club is Pure, which has definitely fallen off.",1,1,0

Also the idea of lounging poolside at various pools lured me. My boyfriend and two other friends planned a couples trip for boyfriend's birthday July 5th-7th. Since we'd be staying there during the week as opposed to a weekend, I thought we'd be able to get a good room for a decent rate. We booked the Pure Package and I think we paid about $350 for two nights. The package came with 2 VIP passes to Pure, and entrance to the Fitness Center and Qua Bath Spa (which I highly recommend). I know the VIP doesn't really mean shit but I couldn't prove it because we went to Pure on a Tuesday night, so there was no line anyway. 

We booked a room in the Augustus tower which is one of the nicer towers. It was great! My favorite part was the bathroom. First of all, it's huge. You can re-enact scenes from Step It Up in there, take a bath and a shower at once since there is a separate bathtub, and the best part...watch tv! We had a nice view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show. The bed was comfortable. I recommend staying in this tower because it's closest to the check-in and entrance however, it's a bit of a walk to the pool.

The main pool was nice. I'm a little bummed that I didn't get to explore the other pools but the heat was tiring and once I found a spot to lay on, I didn't want to move. There's a cocktail waitress to serve you or you can go to the bar and order there which also has food. Nothing like drinking a margarita and eating fried food under a 103 degree sun in your bikini.

This place is freaking historic and reigned as one of the top hotels in Vegas for quite sometime... Unfortunately, Caesars has hit a bit of a dry spell, especially as newer more modern casinos have hit the strip. The rooms here are nice, but not always spectacular, the amenities leave a bit to be desired and the casino is still a bit difficult to navigate and there isn't enough table game (craps, etc...) Regardless, I have had a great time over the last several years at Caesars and I believe with Omnia now open and some of the new restaurants coming in that this place will gain back its relevance.

Pros:
- I think they have the best buffet on the Strip: Bacchanal Buffet. On top of that, their other restaurants are quite good. 

Cons:
- The parking is a pain. The parking lot structure seems pretty far from the actual casino entrance, so it can be difficult to navigate. I can't imagine doing it when it's actually 100°+. Also, much like other casinos nowadays, they charge for parking. It's so annoying.

- Since the place is enormous, it was rather easy to get lost. Their signs, as well as some of their employees aren't helpful at all. I had to circle back and forth to find the restaurant I was looking for. 

- I'm not much of a fan of the tables here, I find the dealers to be quite snobby.

alright, here's what i got out of my two-night stay:
- palace tower = it costs more, but the amenities are the same, except with a more modern decor and the flat screen.  (although they may have put the flat screens in the older rooms too...who knows.)  my favorite thing about this tower is the hotel pool is in this tower right by the elevator.
- poolside = nice area with two large pools.  but closes at 6pm.  hello?  what is the point of that?  the sun hadn't even set yet!  and vegas is full of drunkards and people w\/out poolside etiquette.  this means towels and trash left all over the place.  open chairs were hard to find.  they had 1 waitress for each side of the pool.  there were at least 60 people on each side.  needless to say, the food\/beverage service sucked.  
- valets = very courteous.
- beds = really comfy.  a standard room with two queen beds fit 4 girls pretty well.

we had the goverment discount rate, so i have no idea what the regular price is.  i don't stay on the strip often enough to have a ""favorite hotel"", so that's about it.  i'd give the poolside a 2, so averaging with my 4 overall is the main reason for the 3 star review.

Caesars Palace is humongous and absolutely gorgeous.  I have passed through Caesars Palace and have eaten at multiple restaurants that are located inside of this hotel & casino, but to actually have a room there was really nice!  It was easy access to the Forum shop, multiple great restaurants (Guy Savoy, Nobu, Mesa Grill), and the pools that they have is pretty awesome!

My bf and I had great service from start to finish while staying at Caesars Palace.  We arrived early and attempted to check in and was told that our room was not ready yet.  The guy at the front desk was so helpful and really nice.  He said that he'll rush a room for us and took down my number so that I'll be texted when the room was ready.  He then offered my bf and I bottled waters.  When I asked him about the swimming pools, he gave me a key just so I could go and check the pools out.  He also gave me a map of the pools and told me the ones that he recommended.  He told me that there are 7 pools even though on the site, it says 8 pools.  Literally within 15 minutes, I received a text stating that the room was ready.  We were placed in the Forum tower and our luggage were brought up to us within minutes.

The room itself was spacious with a lot of mirrors everywhere, a shower that had a bench and a rain shower head, and controls on the wall that open and close the drapes.  They didn't have any of those signs that you hang on your doorknob for privacy.  Instead, there were controls and buttons near the door for you to push on to request cleaning service or privacy.  I thought that was pretty cool!  The only downside to the room is that they did not have any plug-ins to charge your phone right at the bedside.  I had to unplug the lamp in order to plug my charger in right behind the bedside table.  The bed was also fairly comfortable and the pillows were very fluffy. 

As for the swimming pools, honestly, it was kind of breathtaking, and crazy to know that they had 7 pools there.  The pools are 3-4 feet deep and there is one that has blackjack card dealers in the middle so that you can continue to gamble while hanging out in the pool.  There is a topless pool that is located elsewhere.  There are also deck chairs that are sometimes hard to come by depending on how busy it is.  There are daybeds and cabanas with TVs inside, but with those, you would have to pay to reserve.

Overall, Caesars Palace was a great place to stay on the strip!  For our trip, we didn't really have to leave the hotel\/casino too often because everything that we needed was all right there.  I'm not sure how much it would cost to stay there, but if you can afford it, it is definitely one of the most beautiful hotels to stay at in Vegas besides the Venetian.",2,0,1

The game selection is lacking, room service prices are expensive even by Vegas standards. The worst part was at checkout when they hit us with sneaky internet charges, at no time was it stated that you may only connect 2 devices on their WIFI unless you want to pay more, not at check-in when I made sure the internet charges were covered by the resort fee, or when I called down after arriving at the room when I had a brief connectivity issue, they also try to sell you different speed with extra charges, who do they think they are? an ISP? 

I tried to get an explanation about these charges from the front desk manager, he just said I should have read the terms of service and walked away!  Great client relations there!   

They wound up backing out the $4.99 charge but 3 $13.99 charges remain with no explanation as to what they are for. I thought this was covered under the daily resort fee $32.50    When I called the customer service number they were useless as well.

Did I mention that when I got to my room the cleaning lady was still cleaning it.

Octavius (newest)
Augustus (DIRECT VIEW of BELLAGIO fountain - very nice)
Palace\/Forum (ehhh)
Roman (AVOID)

Caesar's Palace is almost 5 different hotels because depending on which tower you stay in, it'll totally make or break your experience.  With that being said, I have also ranked them from best to worst. Be wary if you book on travel sites such as Expedia because the ""LOW"" price...what you will get is the ""ancient"" aka OUTDATED Roman tower rooms.

For the true experience, try getting the Octavius or Augustus tower rooms. The rooms are right by the lobby and only a short elevator ride to the pool. Our Augustus deluxe king room was SUPER spacious and had a nice bathroom with his\/her sinks, separate soaking tub and a huge shower. We also got a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.

It's one of the TRUE resort hotels in Las Vegas. One of the best pools, had tons of dining options, Omnia Nightclub, Bacchanal Buffet, and the Forum Shops...the property sprawls the Strip. Even from the boulevard, walking on the Strip...it can take up to 15 minutes to clear it. 

As one of the mainstays in Las Vegas, the pricing here isn't cheap. It may not be as expensive as the Cosmo or Wynn\/Encore but it's definitely up there. For any discounts, be sure to sign up for their Total Rewards cards...even as a gold member, they will send you discounts and offers.

Speaking of their Player's Cards...they definitely cater toward their Diamond and 7 Star level players here at Caesar's. Priority check-in, line cuts, premium this..premium that...yadada...even the main valet is only open for diamond\/7 star players when it's busy. Caesar's Palace is one of the high end properties within the Total Rewards program, so it'll take care of it's players. I also like how the Diamond Lounge is right by the Octavius\/Augustus Towers and not hidden in the casino like other ones.

For some classic Vegas history with modern day luxury...I would definitely recommend it. 4 stars because you can definitely find a better deal, but hey it's Vegas and it's okay to splurge!",12,2,4

For reference, I have stayed at a lot of the other casinos on the strip: Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Palazzo, etc. Hubby and I are here for 20th wedding anniversary and hubby's birthday. We come to Vegas 2-4 times per year so we are regulars and pretty much know what to expect. 

Our room at Caesar' is a ""Palace Tower"" deluxe king. The issues:

*Upon arrival at front of hotel, there is no offer to take our bags up for us, we cannot find anyone to help us. We take our bags up ourselves.

*The Palace Tower is located deep into the property with unclear signage and when we find someone to show us the pathway, the pathway has numerous stairs with no ramps available. We have to struggle pulling\/pushing our luggage down the stairs. Apparently there is another path with ramps but it is the ""long"" way according to the employee. Is this legal with ADA requirements? 

*Our mattress hands down is one of the most uncomfortable hotel mattresses I've ever experienced. I have had way better mattresses at far smaller and modest casinos. The mattress ""plush top"" is smashed flat with no comfort provided at all. I call the front desk to see if there is a comparably priced room that we can be moved to due to the location of the Palace tower and the condition of the mattress and I am told that there are no rooms available. I ask if we can pay to upgrade and the attendant says no, they are completely booked (on a Thursday night in the middle of February? whatever). I then ask if we are on the hook for the remaining two nights if I would like to relocate to another casino and the front desk attendant says she doesn't know I have to call the reservations department. No offer to assist or find out. 

* We are trying to sleep in a bit after a late night and at about 9:00 am there is constant loud drilling\/construction noise audible from our hotel room. I guess no sleeping in.

-  Check in process.  The clerk at check in desk kept trying to sell for upgrade or an early check-in for a fee.  
- Check-in time.  Not sure if this was standard for other hotels on the strip, but Caesars has a check-in time at 4pm.  I expected it to be 1pm or 2 at the latest, but 4pm is way too long of waiting.
- The room is small and old.  Nothing fancy.  It feels like one of those 3 stars hotels elsewhere. 
- Shower is half working and operate at a weird way. 
- No body wash.
- The electric outlet at the bathroom is not working.  Have to use the dryer at the working desk for the mirror.
- No refrigerator in room.  Nor any coffee machine or bottle of water.  Really, almost nothing.
- Trying to cash one of the tickets at the cashier, and found a long line, but only one window is for all guest whereas other windows are for some types of premium members, and even that window has no one attending.  Really? 
- Relatively expensive comparing to other hotels in general.
- $32 resort fee daily.

It is definitely easy to get lost in this hotel and casino. From the parking garage, to the food court, Forum Shops, Serendipity, Bacchanal buffet, Colosseum theater, conference rooms, pools, and the new nightclub Omnia, Caesars offers everything a guest could need.

For a quick run down if this is your first time:
The parking garage could use a little work. It is always so crowded and makes it hard to find parking. The food court offers the typical Italian, sandwiches, burgers, Asian, and Mexican foods with plenty of dining room. The Forum Shops is like an indoor mall that can be accessed through the casino from where the parking garage elevators are. It has many top brand and unique shops... even a fish tank on one end. Serendipity is a restaurant located just outside of Caesars on the strip. Definitely check it out if you're starving and don't worry about the time of day; they have any kind of food, breakfast lunch and\/or di..ESSERT! Bacchanal is an upscale buffet (I'll have a review on it's own later). The Colosseum is where you can catch shows at night of performers like Celine Dion (now Mariah Carey). The conference rooms are huge and good for any event. The pools are definitely worth a visit for all the Roman architectures. Lastly, the day\/nightclub Omnia as I heard is a huge party. I can't say much for because I haven't visited yet.

The hotel rooms are all nice, no matter which tier you're in. Of course the bigger the better, right? Enjoy your stay!",4,1,3

In relative terms, Las Vegas used to be a ""decent buy""...if you didn't go crazy gambling, you could find decent hotel, restaurant and show prices. They used to want to encourage you to come so that you would spend your money at the gaming tables. Now they take every opportunity to gouge you.

We were 1 1\/2 hrs early for check-in...we arrived at 3 pm...not eggregiously early. We were told that it would be $30 extra to check in early. Also, and I am having trouble remembering the long list of extras...$30 per night for an extra person in our room (our four year old daughter), $30 per night for a rollaway bed, $25 per night for a refrigerator. When we checked out, we also discovered that the resort fee of $30 a night was not included in our rate...therefore, we were charged $15 a night for internet!

We were offered a ""bargain upgrade"" to a suite for an additional $200 a night. If we took this, the other fees would magically go away. Well, we had just flown in and had gotten up at 2am, so we were basically zombies at this point. We agreed to be ""upgraded"". Unfortunately, this meant giving up our room in the nice Augustus tower for the suite in the Forum tower. This turned out to be pretty old and decrepit...the renovations amounted to little more than slapping lipstick on a pig. Our suite was huge, but pretty sparsely furnished. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls, the AC unit in the ceiling was dripping condensation onto our table, and it really felt kind of depressing. For half of our stay, we couldn't even get robes and slippers...I had called down to customer service and they CLAIMED that they did not provide such amenities. Bullshit. On my fourth try, I finally got someone who cheerfully sent them up. WTF????

Cleaning lady came in at 9:30am to kick us out. What if we were very tired or had to sleep in from the night before? Totally disrespectful. 

Check in is at 4pm. I'm sorry, but if you have cleaning ladies barging in at 9:30am I'm sure you can get the rooms cleaned well before that. Was very inconvenient for us.

A couple weeks ago, after booking a trip at non-caesar properties I get a call offering me free night at a caesars property. Explained to the guy that I requested to NEVER be contact by them again. He apologized and continued to offer me 3 free nights. Told him I had no interest and that they would need to make me a crazy offer to continue setting foot on their property again. I also explained free nights meant nothing as I can stay anywhere I want for free whenever I want. He said he would talk to his boss.

I don't know why, but I always kind of associate Las Vegas and Caesars Palace. Maybe it is pop culture or whatever, but the two are linked in my head. Although I didn't stay at Caesars, one thing I had planned to do was to walk through the Casino. 

I love the Roman theme and the hotel fully embraces it. There are fountains, columns, and statues everywhere. Walking into the shops area is really cool because the ceiling is painted like the sky and it feels like you are walking down a Roman street. The shopping area was huge and contained just about every high-end retailer you could imagine. 

The Casino area was huge and had all the games you would expect to see. There were bars and restaurants everywhere.

We had left our room for the night and the next morning I went to look in my wallet (which was hidden in a bag under my clothes in my suitcase) to find all my cash missing. My other friends had all their cash missing as well that they had in safe places (we should have used the safe though - even though it was the size of a jewelry box and won't fit shit).  About $700 missing in total.  Security came and I was prompted to fill out an incident report.  First thing he asked me was if the door was secured close.  Umm yes...if I close my door and hear a click I assume it is closed!  Apparently they have insecure doors because they don't fully close.  So either a random person was pushing on doors because they knew how insecure they were or it was a staff employee who had a key.  I asked the security guy if I\/he could look at the cameras after I gave him the time frame the incident could have occurred and he kept telling me that he couldn't tell me if there were cameras, if the cameras showed our room, and proceeded to LAUGH at me.  Are you serious? No remorse, no concern.  He said I would get contacted via email in 2-3 days.  USELESS.  We filled a police report which was useless as well.  The front desk credited me our resort fees - a mere $120.  They really should have given us the night they we were robbed for free....but no Caesar's is too cheap to do that.  They charge for early check-in (about $34) and Wi-Fi $15 a day.  Those should both be free!

Even for a Monday it was pretty slow--the sour economy had definitely taken a toll on Las Vegas.  On the upside, if you were in town and had some money to gamble with, there were lots of open seats at the blackjack tables and plenty of elbow room at craps.

HOTEL: I stayed in the Augustus Tower.  The room isn't super-extravagant by any means but it's spacious and includes a desk, a small table, a couch, and a flat-panel TV.  It also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The bathroom is very nice--spacious with marble floors, a jacuzzi tub, a glass-doored shower, and a little room for the toilet.  Nothing remarkable about the other room amenities.  I've never been to the gym or spa, but I hear they are incredible--much better than Wynn and even better than the Bellagio.  On the downside, my bed mattress felt a little cheap and uneven, which was a disappointment as I've stayed in the Augustus Tower several times in the past and this was the first time I've had that problem.

CASINO: This is why you come to Vegas, right?  Caesars has just about every game you could want.  (I don't think they have Casino War, but you shouldn't be playing that anyway.)  The gaming floor is pretty spacious and clean.  The Sports Book is huge and is a good place to watch a game even if you can't get a one of the nice seats.  One disappointment was that it looks like all the relatively more favorable payouts are gone: 9-6 Jacks or Better video poker is replaced with 8-5 or worse!  Also, I couldn't find a blackjack table with the dealer staying on soft 17 (though I didn't check the few tables in the baccarat room).  The Poker Room looks pretty good, and they even have a rather large set-off area for tournaments.  In terms of cash games, though, there never seems to be enough of a crowd.  For baccarat, the tables are well-spaced though almost all of the tables are lacking the new computer screens (which, of course, prevents those great ""Push the button!"" moments).  I thought that the dealers were quite friendly.  The little lounge for baccarat players is decent.  A couple of years ago, they had these addictive little gummy candies, but, alas, they are no more.  You'll have to head to your local Chinese grocer.

RESTAURANTS, ETC.: A lot of the restaurants deserve their own review, but here's the overview.  Generally, I think Caesars offers a very nice selection of places to eat, and that's not even including what you find in the Forum Shops.  I wouldn't characterize any restaurant as mind-blowing, though.  True, the buffet (Cafe Lago) is less impressive than many other casinos on the strip, but the food is alright.  Augustus Cafe is pretty standard.  Beijing Noodle No. 9 was just opening when I visited, but, at least architecturally, it looks like an exciting place.  Hyakumi is pretty standard sushi fare.  I was a little disappointed with Mesa Grill given Bobby Flay's celebrity, and I suppose the same goes with Guy Savoy.  (Note, however, Guy Savoy has the most amazing bacon bread I've ever tasted.  This, indeed, was mind-blowing.)  Neros is pretty standard.  Rao's is pretty decent Italian fare, though I was shocked how empty the place was in December.  I've never been to Sea Harbour, but when that same space was Empress Court, I thought it was very good.  PURE deserves a special mention.  I haven't been there since October 2006, but the place is great, albeit expensive (in the range of $2,500 for a table for five, a bottle of Dom, a couple bottles of Grey Goose, and generous tips to our smoking hot server and a very helpful bouncer.)  If you're willing to spend a decent amount of money to get a table, I think it's worth it, if only not to stand in those ridiculously long lines.

COMPARABLES: Overall, Caesars is not quite as good as Wynn, but just better than Aladdin (which has been replaced with Planet Hollywood).",2,1,1

I stayed at Caesars for 1 week (Sun to Sun) - paying for a sleeping room, daily coffees; snacks, Nobu and one of the best but most expensive buffets ever.  During this trip I also dined at other fine establishments and for the remaining (3) days of my visit I gambled in other casinos.  So I dropped plenty of money at Caesars between the room, food\/beverages and gambling!  I am unique gambler in the sense that I am comfortable giving my money to the casino as long as I get to play!!  So I made a donation every night to Caesars for the first 4 nights - on the fifth night, I played and broke even.  Ecstatic not to have a lost, I went to cashier to cash my chips!   That is when I discovered that Caesars treats the ordinary gambler as a second class citizens!  I waited over 20 minutes to cash in - 20 MINUTES!!!  Why.....because I was eighth in a growing line of people in a non-platinum corral.  Initially there were 3 of 9 windows open NONE OF WHICH was the window marked ""all"".  This meant that every time a cashier was available the platinum people were selected and the non-platinum people remained stagnate.  I get the purpose of platinum status and the privileges associated with being an elite member of a casino, airline carrier, etc. etc.  But when the fourth window was opened and it was still marked platinum and service was continued to the platinum members over the growing line of regular folks, well I along with those around me became infuriated!!!  Let me point out that out of all windows, most were marked platinum, a couple gold and only one ""all"".  This is understandable, but NOT to have a single ""ALL"" window open is completely unacceptable!!!  I complained to the teller who was not interested, I spoke to a pit boss who suggested I speak to a manager, a manager was summoned and he suggested I fill out a comment card as he has no control over the cashier station!  
I begrudgingly completed  my stay but for the remaining (3) nights I refused to gamble at Caesars, refused to eat at Caesars and would only purchase my first morning coffee at the Starbucks at Caesars!!

Not only did we have to wait until 4pm to check in, but when we finally got into the suite, the real issues began.

It was dirty (carpet had really filthy areas, the door jam outside looked like someone had spilled beer on it, and several yellow upholstered chairs were so dirty I had to move them out and hide them in a closet); the furniture was chipped, tablecloths had holes in them   When I requested housekeeping to help clean up some of the filth on the door and in the service area, they showed up 2 hours later.  By that time I had already cleaned the grime away.  (Note that all of the staff that came by to help were very nice and really tried to fix the issues -- such as get the air conditioner to work, and get the front double door to closes!) 

It also came with no standard-stocked items.  When I requested a coffee pot to replace the K-cup maker, they told me I had to ""rent"" one for $40; to get a corkscrew required calling room service and paying for them to deliver one, etc, etc. etc.

The room had an old television that had interference at times. The carpet had stains, but not necessarily unsanitary. Every room that I saw in the Roman Tower was completely different. I had a room with a separate shower and bath tub where a friend only had a smaller bathroom with a shower and another friend's room was so big that they could have a dance party in there.
 My view was of the roof and the tower next to us, nothing special.  Our other friends had a view of the pool which was nice.
I understand the Roman Tower is the lowest tier room, but I know you can get better quality for a better price at many other premier strip hotels.

The POOL was the best part and is why I'm giving this review three stars and not two.  I loved every part of the pool situation.  You could relax or walk 20 feet and play blackjack or walk another 50 feet and be in a dance party.  Kids weren't really an issue and our part of 15 were able to throughout the day get lounge chairs and eventually all sit together.  We were going to purchase a cabana but boy am I glad we didnt! $1500 minimum ($500 rental and $1000 f&B credit) the cabanas are NOT what I expected when we got there so I'm so happy we didn't do that! 
The frozen drinks at the pool that were $22 had 4 shots of alcohol in them - not bad when you think of how much one drink would have been.  The fish tacos and french fries at the pool were delish!

During checkout, the line was HUGE at 11 am (checkout deadline). Thank goodness I checked out via text and then stored my bag with the bellman.

As for the casino, I think it's nice.  Table minimums were a bit high for me and I did walk across the street Saturday night as I wanted to play $5-10 hands not $25 hands.

I have stayed in the MGM, Bellagio, Venetian, and the Palazzo and recently Ceasar's Palace. We had an awesome stay. I highly recommend Caesar's- but request a room in the newer Octavius Tower- we had a pool view. These rooms have the most comfortable beds which makes it hard to even get out of in the mornings. The room was clean, decent size with a sitting area and the bathrooms are large and spacious with deep soaking tubs. 
The pools at Caesar's are the best and the $17 mojito was perfect. Ok so they do nickel and dime you on the fees but that's not uncommon at these sprawling Vegas resorts. And yes we added the resort package onto our room for $28 for internet and for use of the fitness room which I used everyday during our stay. DO NOT TOUCH THE MINI BAR - EXPENSIVE!! There is a nice little sundries shop right by the lobby- buy your bottled water and snacks there to save money. 
The amenities - the pool, the fitness room, the Qua Spa, the location on the strip, and being close to the forum shops is why I loved staying at Caesars! I am a huge fan of getting the day pass to Qua Spa- it's normally $45 however they charged me $25 probably because I had the resort package added in my room cost.

We finally got in to our room at the Octavius Tower which is far but I never really thought of it as a problem as it was close to the pool, the buffet, and close to the food court hahahah. I am currently preggo so food access is essential.

Room was nice and spacious...There is a section for the beds (yes i like to get two Queen as one is to sleep and one is for my toodler to play and jump on and rub his play-doh all over the place), a couch area, and the bathroom had a walk in shower and a jacuzzi. I liked that the toilet was also in there with a door (hahaha). The bathroom was spacious as well which made it a perfect time to do some aerobic exercises as my son enjoyed his time in the tub. I loved the door bell action when someone came to your door. Refrigerator is completely stocked with shots, beer, alcohol, and they have a snack bar along with an intimacy kit lol. What sucks about the refrigerator is you are not able to put in your own stuff in there...So we had a mini cooler to put our drinks that we got from target that was way cheaper than the drinks in the refrigerator. And again...a refrigerator is very important to me ...especially having a toddler and storing his yogurt or milk.

Wifi sucks in that tower...it's free but that is how they get you. To get the good Wifi you HAVE to pay. Valet sucks in general and it is a shame that this is a popular hotel...you have to wait 10-15 minutes to get your car...give or take. 

What I also liked about staying here is the easy access to the Forum shops... and there is just absolutely alot to do in there. 

Would I stay here again... maybe...not the ""I want to go back to Caesar's"" feel. I would go there to walk around and visit yes... But I think I would want to try other places on the strip first.

Oh yea.... housekeeping is nice they came quick to change the bedding after I checked and saw red stains on it",0,0,0

I was assaulted at the pool by a group of men who were drunk and having x rated sex in the public pool where family's were swimming with small children. I complained to the life guard who observed their lewd acts. She proceeded to tell them this is a public pool and that there was a complaint. The 2 guys started flipping everyone off yelling F..... U it only escalated from there the waiter pointed us out as the ones who complained the group came running from the other side of the pool and began attacking me! I was screaming for security and we received no help by the Caesars staff. A guest sitting by us stood up and kept them from punching me. The situation was terrifying I have it all on video Caesars security showed up 10 minutes later and treated us deplorable I was humiliated in front of all the guest and friends.  He was Unprofessional and did not know how to Handel a crisis situation. We have been coming here every year for the trauma and critical care conference that Dr. Maddox has put on for the last 48 years. I am not satisfied with managements nonchalant response and will pursue further action. I do not feel safe in this hotel and would not recommend staying here!

Also, unlike so many other casinos, there was no one from Caesar's checking room key cards in the guest elevator wells.  Anyone could walk right in from the street and go straight to any guest door in the tower.

A friend of ours had enough rewards to get a room there for only $40 or so. Mind you, at this time we weren't in the most stable financial conditions but who can resist Caesars Palace? 

Well, I can. But  I won't. 

Anyway, booked online for $40 and was expecting some trashy room right next to the janitors assistants intern's bathroom and drove 3 hours to Vegas. Pulled up to the Valet parking only to be told to take my pretentious ass to the other entrance since this is for 7 diamond or whatever. I turned around and drove to the other area and made my way to the reception where we were greeted by this extra ordinarily nice gentleman who was very happy to finish his shift after dealing with us. 

He was courteous and very polite especially when he told me that they will be charging $200 deposit to my card. There goes the slot machine money. I understand that they actually do charge this money but CP may charge more than others or maybe its because I was just out of my damn league there. I did think about Best Western suites a couple of miles down the Poor People Avenue. Anyway, not to seem phased by this revelation, I gave my card hoping it won't get declined. However, this guy gave us a free upgrade. He gave us a room on the top floor!! Now thats the bang for your buck. 

The hotel itself was obviously exquisite. I have been to many 5 star hotels in my good times and this is certainly in the top 20. One thing you can't escape even in CP is the Las Vegas stench found in every room of every damn hotel over there. 

Our stay was only for a night and most of it was spent taking selfies by my wife. We walked around, played a few slots, lost all our money and then just got into the hot tub. 

Overall, it was a good experience and now that the financial condition is better, I plan to go back knowing what to expect.",1,2,0

All the water and statues provide an eloquence of to the casino that has remained the same over the years, at least on the outside. 

The shopping here continues to be a huge draw more many even thought the cost to shop here is VERY high.

The garden area in the front of the Palace is very nice. The flowing water is just very calming. I think it is even a better attraction at night. 

Get to the entrance can be a bit like a maze because there are so many twists and turns you have to take to get there. 

Once you are inside you feel like you are walking into a historic casino. Take a left or a right because either way will lead you to the land of ""Lights and Sounds"". 

If you take a right or left you wind up doing a lap around the machines and the a few tables while on the outside there are the big gaming tables and a few hallways to other gaming areas and shopping areas. 

I had hoped to get to one of the restaurants here for a meal but around noon time the wait for food seemed a bit longer than usual. There are a few places to go to grab a quick bite but I was looking for a sit down meal. 

Very spacious casino. By far, one of the more open casinos throughout in all facets. The gaming rooms are spread out to give room to walk comfortably and the shops are fairly widened to move around without bumping into other people.

Wifi connect is really bad. You have to reconnect every time if you become idle for more than 30 mins. And if you finally get online, it's slow. Irritating. I could use my own data, the reception in our hotel was really poor.  Ordered breakfast in yesterday, they left the dirty dishes in our room all day. The housekeeper didn't tell in room dining to pick up dirty dishes so our room stank of old food. Called in room dining again and it took them three hours to get the dirty dishes out. It's was frustrating because they said it was our job to tell them to pick up the dishes. What???   No that's not our job, but we did tell housekeeper to get dishes before we left in the morning.

I say this because while being a broke college student, we always stayed at the other palace on the strip... The Imperial Palace... 

It was New Years Day, 2013 I got a great deal and booked under $100 for the night!

It was the BF and I and we wanted something central for Taxi purposes, this is important! We were going to be clubbing at LAVO for the evening so taking a cab, or walking in my heels, you have to think about being centrally located.

Got upgraded to the Forum Tower (I don't know what we had before) on the top floor.. (Hello # 69!) Walked in and found the room to be pretty spacious for the 2 of us. Nice King bed, couch, and cool bathroom (No tub, just a pretty cool shower) TV in the mirror (Great for getting ready for clubbing).

I liked how close the tower was to the casino (You walk right into it!) and it was pretty close to the parking garage, and to the Forum shops! 

LAVO was playing all that EDM Music. So after the open bar, we left and ended up a PURE.  This was the quickest walk back to the room ever! Stop by PURE and get on the Hotel guestlist. Room Key may be requested.

My girlfriends and I stayed in a deluxe room in the Palace Tower. Our room was very nice, with a great view. It was also quite spacious. I loved the jacuzzi tub and the comfy bed (even though I only slept about 2 hours the entire weekend).

The hotel is in the perfect location on the strip...in the middle of everything! The only time we ever got a cab was at 5am on our way to the palms. The staff is extremely hospitable and will help you get in anywhere, or give you good recommendations.

Caesar's has my favorite pool  (its actually a pool complex),and they even keep the Venus pool open year round.

You could honestly stay in Caesars all day and be completely satisfied.

It was good for, well, what it was good for.

While on the higher end of the spectrum in terms of price range and the accommodations themselves, I can still by far, view there being vast amounts of room for improvement.

Upon viewing our forms of identification the gal' at the front desk quickly took notice of us celebrating 2 birthdays and while we'd initially booked a relatively large room already, she upgraded us to a Penthouse suite within the Auugustus Tower.

- - - - - SUITEEEEE! (pun very much intended)

As mentioned within another review, this particular area of the hotel encompasses its own Starbucks. It was nice to bypass this several times as we entered and exited the elevators. 

For those new to Caesars, the place bears a bit of a regal feel. Not quite as plush as ""The Palace"" in San Francisco but still....

From the massive statues to the soaring high cathedral ceilings, you can't help but think that you've made it by stepping foot into this place; at least on a Vegas scale!!! To further it, it's located within the epicenter of EVERYTHING!!! Stepping out onto ""The Strip"", you really don't have to cab or Uber anything as everything's within walking distance!!!

- - - - - - What I can further attest to is this place being massive! Any time a hotel provides a map at check in, I've learned to anticipate a surplus of tourist(s) let alone the need for an Excedrin.

Boasting an array of restaurants (enough to satisfy any palette), let alone venues of entertainment, and Lord the shopping!!! (at the Forum), the hotel also possesses a plethora of garages for parking alongside optional valet (free of charge). Valet affront the ""actual"" front entrance was at capacity upon our pulling up and we were asked to circle around and take use of the Coliseum's valet parking option...... we weren't however, made aware of just how far this joint actually was!

Upon rerouting, we bypassed 2 other valet parking options and finally made our way where we were intended to be. This parking option, while COMPLETELY EMPTY is far as hell from Hotel Registration (we were dayum near back in California!!!) and we were forced to trek the entire way back to the front of the place just to do so.

- - - - - - Nothing like walking a mile through a casino with luggage after a 4-5 hour drive out.

I'm deducting 1\/2 a star as I\/we were informed upon being issued keys, that our bags should've been taken to the front when we pulled up and were greeted by the first valet guy upon his informing us that they were full.

o__O

In any event, our room was spacious. Hands down, HUGGGGGGE! We're talking gi'normous and possessed a partial ""Strip"" view as well as one of the pool. We were on the 30th floor and it was quite tranquil........that is, until after the concert. We elected to go back to the room and change and noise from outside could be heard from within our suite.

Come on Caesar's!

- - - - - - For $325\/night + the resort fee + taxes and the host of other add-on's ---need I even say that bleeding noise from outsiders should be rendered COMPLETELY obsolete?!!!

Thereon, for the size of the room, the flat screen, mounted appropriately on the wall between the bed and living quarters was absurdly undersized. I'd hypothesize it to have been all of 32'. 

For a suite? GTFOH!!!!______________________

It was actually quite confusing how the television within the bathroom was almost the same size as the one designated for the living area; another 1\/2 point star deduction guys ^ ^ ^ .

Room service however and as anticipated, was efficient BUT pricey!!!! I ordered a burger of some sort and he, a pasta dish. Adding on 2 Patron margaritas (a good $30\/a piece), our order summed a good $120.00. It filled us but was nothing you'll see me writing home about.

- - - - - - What concerns me at places like this is exactly whom to tip. 

It appears that EVERYONE wants AND GETS your money! From the front desk, to the valet guys partitioning tips, to the bell guys, to room service....the list goes on and on. 

The strategy of Las Vegas seems to be to take all of your money and send you on your way impoverished and homesick!

#succubus

Without hesitation do I extend the highest accolades to Mariah's marketing team while I'm at it. Lord have mercy. This chick was EVERYWHERE!!!! From the billboards seen from the freeway and upon the hotel's exterior, down to her having her own gift shop within the casino!!! 

Who's ""obsessed"" now Mariah? Jeeez! 

It's even crazier when you phone the front desk and hear ""Honey"" and ""Butterfly"" streaming as you hold....................... sadly though, that's what I feel as if I\/we paid for --- Mariah's marketing.

   Lines for the club at the hotel are lonnnnnggg, however if you are a set of women, you will probably get in quick. (Sorry guys!!!) and there is constantly a flow of people wherever you go. Also people with crazy looking drinks just walking around. I def. liked the fact that there were plenty of places to walk to for food or just to check out and the taxi service was also excellent. Fun times!",1,2,1

I have experienced and walked around Caesars Palace as a whole many times in the past but this review is for people whom are looking into reserving their conference rooms for events, meetings..etc. 

Firstly, Caesars Palace Conference Center's are located upstairs in two locations levels which are the Promenade Level and Emperors Level. Just FYI (For Your Information) the locations of their conference centers are not quite a ways away from the Ground\/Casino Level and even further away from the parking lot, short distance if you Valet Park or ride a taxi in from the front entrance of Caesars Palace.

Once you get to the Caesars Palace Conference Center's they are laid out and setup very elaborately with such historical Roman style detail it could be breathe taking to some that admire this type scene. The location is also very nice because from certain areas of the conference levels you'll have an excellent view of the Caesar's Garden of the Gods Oasis pool area looking out the side windows, it's awesome. The conference rooms themselves have all sorts of different sizes from small to very large areas, it all depends on what kind of event or meeting you will be holding and how many people will be attending. Caesars have a large variety of choices for rooms to choose from, they are very accommodating to what your needs are and will make your needs will be met with no issues.

Caesars Palace Conference Center's rooms can be set up to how you would like it to be set up. The rooms we had reserved had chairs, tables, projectors, water cooler, and coffee station with complimentary breakfast goodies (muffins, cookies..etc), stage and flat panel viewing screens. They also have a Receptionist Desk located in the area to take care of badges and other information you will need in order to provide access to your conferences\/meetings, they had nice amenities located all over through the largely spaced areas. Caesars was very good at refilling our coffee stations whenever we requested it and with quick service at hand. We had little\/minor issues but nothing too crazy and nothing that Caesars could not handle, they were very professional and courteous about meeting our needs and requests. I would definitely recommend the Caesars Palace Conference Center for people whom are looking to hold large events or meetings, but make sure your budget will be able to handle it.",68,37,62

The creme inside the fruit cups had a very bland taste that I only took the fruit cups so that I could scrape the minute berries atop the cup.

I stayed in the Roman Tower, since the conference I was attending was at Caesars. I was actually pretty excited about staying here, since it's still the original megaresort and has a great 5-star reputation.

I was disappointed with the room overall. My room (585) was pretty large, but oddly triangular. There was no desk to do work. WiFi was an extra charge, so the lack of a desk really mattered. There was a wired connection behind the TV, but I would have had to sit on the floor to do work...

There was a separate tub and shower in the bathroom, which was long and narrow like a train car. Oddly, there was no shelf\/ledge in the shower and the shampoo\/conditioner kept falling off the soap dish. The towels themselves seemed worn and over bleached.  And does Caesars not have robes for the guests?? Maybe my room just didn't have them; In a 5-star hotel, a robe would be nice. 

I am absolutely NOT a stickler about luxury details.  Normally, as long as the room is clean and the shower works, I'm happy.

*I talk about back in the day like I'm in my 50's, if you couldn't already tell.*

One thing I really miss is the original facade. Caesars has always been one of the tackier places, but now it's just TOO tacky. I miss the original gold plated alcove over the main entrance and I LOVED the glowing blue towers. And the area outside is just a mess. The nice gardens and driveway were replaced with that Roman Plaza thing which makes getting in and out the place kind of a mindfuck. 
There also used to be a HUGE arcade and motion-simulator theater in the basement of the Forum Shops. I had many fun days at those places as a kid. Good times.
I'm happy Cleopatra's Barge is still around though, what kid didn't want to rub the bosom of Cleopatra's figurine?
Another thing I remember is the Race For Atlantis. It was a motion-simulator thing right next to the Atlantis show(fittingly enough), now it's just a giant, gloomy open space. 

As for things that are there NOW, the Colosseum is a very nice theater. Not a single seat is very far from the stage. The food court next to it though definitely doesn't seem to be worth trying. And I LOVE the Forum Shops(even though I can never afford anything).

Oh Caesar, I love how you're nice enough to let peons like me roam freely through your palace.",1,4,1

The table games are always busy and the Poker Room is secluded, which makes it unique. The table limits seem to be a bit more than other casinos, but I guess that's the price of admission. Don't expect to find any $2 Blackjack tables or even a $1\/2 game in the Poker Room.

It is a AAA, Four Diamond luxury hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Bellagio and the Mirage. The hotel has 3,960 rooms in six towers: Augustus, Nobu, Roman, Palace, Octavius and Forum (I was in the Forum tower).  It's a HUGE space and I initially found myself overwhelmed when I arrived.  But once I got my bearings and figured out where everything was I was okay.

I liked my room.  The view from my room was fabulous!  My bed was so comfy!  There were buttons next to the bed opened and closed the blinds and sheers!  When the blinds were closed, I had no idea what time it was it was that dark.  Rather than hanging a ""Do not disturb"" sign on the doorknob, you indicate on a panel which is just inside the room if you want your room made up or not.  Just on the other side of the door outside in the corridor, the light is either red (do no disturb) or green (make up the room) or nothing.  I've never seen this before.

The toilet was in its own room within the bathroom.  There was a phone in the toilet room.  It took me a day to figure out that on the bathroom wall was a remote control for the TV in the bathroom mirror!  There was no tub but a huge shower.

A few times I took a stroll through the Forum Shops, which is a shopping mall connected to Caesars Palace. It has been consistently ranked as one of the most successful shopping malls in the world and is the highest grossing mall in America, with higher sales per square foot than Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.  It includes more than 270 mid-range and luxury retailers, gourmet restaurants and bars.  The ceilings are painted like the sky

I'm not a gambler and there were machines and tables EVERYWHERE!  Surprisingly people are allowed to smoke in the casinos so it was gross walking through them to get to my room.

The weather was sunny and hot (27C) and I spent an hour one day by the pool.  You rent the loungers ... I'd just grabbed an old ratty non-cushioned one.  I heard cabanas go for about $450 a day

There was a mandatory $28US\/day resort fee and that includes WIFI for two devices, local phone calls and two passes to the fitness centre.  My room was $260US\/day including taxes and resort fee.

DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL EVER!!!!!
I am a frequent Las Vegas traveller. I have been to several hotels on the strip. I try to use different hotel ever time I go to experience differently.

This time, I chose Cesar's Palace because of their package deal with Celine Dion show and the room. When I made the reservation over the phone, they forced me to get an expensive room with an excuse of a package deal. When I asked them about the daily rate and the concert ticket price, they told me that they do not know the break down of the package. Yet, they told me to get a more expensive room... Duh

Since the package deal was cheaper than getting their cheapest room and the concert tickets seperately, I agreed  to purchase the deal.

So I arrived at 8am, found out the room was not ready. They told me they are highly occupied that I have to wait. GUESS WHAT??!! I WAITED FOR 8 HOURS!!!!! 8 F* HOURS! After a long tired trip, my family had no other place  to go but to stay in our car!!!! I took an alternative room with a single bed when I reserved for two queen beds because my family were too tired!!!! I asked for a free roller bed which they agreed. They said they would deliver immediately. HOWEVER ""IMMEDIATELY"" MEANT 3 HOURS AND 1 COMPLAINT CALL FOR CESARS PALACE!!!!!

The best is yet to come; CELINE DION SHOW GOT CANCELLED WITOUT ANY NOTICE. They told me all tickets will be refunded. Since I purchased one of my 3 tickets with the front desk, the box office told me that I need to back to them. So on the following day, which was my check-out day, I told the front desk about the ticket refund as I was checking out. The front desk told me that I need to talk to box office, which I did. Then the box office told me to talk to the front desk again. None of them knew how to process the refund for 2 tickets purchased through package and 1 ticket purchased at the front desk.

Back at the front desk, I asked to this one representative for the break down of my package deal. Then he gave me another copy of the room use summary which I received as I checked out. I asked him to give me the breakdown of the package again however he doesn't understand again. Instead he ORDERS me to listen to him that he is going to explain all. Then he starts to explain the room usage break down doing simple mathematics as he is a teacher. How arrogant and  stupid.

That's when I got just furious!!! Not only he is not understanding, he was too arrogant!!!! Every time I tried to ask for what I wanted, he would just order me to listen. When my volume raised up little bit, he orders me to quite down that if not, he would call the security. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT A HIGH-END HOTEL THREATENING THEIR CUSTOMER!!!!!

You tend to get lost walking long distances through noisy casino floors to get to your room. At luxury prices, it doesn't provide a luxury experience. 

The staff is helpful and friendly, but they are overworked-- when I asked if the bell desk could bring down my luggage from my room,
I was told it would take 20 minutes for them to get to my room. That's not the kind of service I expected. 

The buffet is worth experiencing, but other than Nobu, the other restaurants are nothing special.

This is a one-star coming from a person who couldn't care less when it comes to hotel rooms. I've stayed at the Motel 6 and was even fine with it, so to say that my experience at Motel 6 TRUMPS my experience at the Caesars Palace really means something.

1. Outdated rooms. Step up your game, Caesars. Even Circus Circus has all their rooms fully renovated.

2. All our room keys suddenly stopped working the second night even though we had the room checked out for three nights. What? We were extremely tired and all we wanted to do was come back for some rest, but were locked out and had to inconveniently go downstairs to be issued new keys.

3. After working in customer service for more than seven years, I have a lot of empathy for the people who work behind the counter. I understand there are some bad days and some customers just ask for it, but what I got from the incompetent security guard was unacceptable and uncalled for. All I wanted to do was to pick up a binder that was left behind by my friend who had the room checked out to her. My friend spoke to the hotel manager about the situation prior to my arrival and he told her to let me know the procedure: Go to security - get housekeeping involved - get the binder.

This security guard made my life so much harder by playing games, asking who specifically stayed in the room even when I gave him the name of who the room was checked out to, saying the room wasn't checked out to her even though it WAS, playing with the pronunciation of names, making me walk all the way to the front desk even though he knew the power was in his hands to just call housekeeping up for the item, making up ""issues"" even though the hotel manager clearly said THOSE WEREN'T ISSUES to begin with.

Basically, this guy just wanted to come off as if he knew everything and made up his own procedures to kill his boredom. I ultimately got the item after more than an hour of dealing with his incompetence and his need to go on a power trip.

First impression was pretty bad. Walked in to the lobby and immediately noticed the odor of cigarette smoke. Walked up to the registration area where there were clusters of people here and there, but no discernable line to get into. i asked a group of people if they were in line and they didn't know either, so I just got behind some people near one of the open stations. 

Check-in was friendly and went quickly, so no complaints. Long walk through the smoky, noisy, crowded casino to the Forum Tower where I was staying. Short wait for elevators. 

The room was nice and clean, except for the faint smell of smoke. It was a non-smoking room. Bed and pillows were comfortable, nice shower, good water pressure, spacious bathroom. There was a coffee maker but the coffee powder cups aren't free. The sign next to the coffee maker didn't say saying anything about cost, but tells you where the K-cups are located. Once you find it, there's small print on the box that says you will be billed if you opened the box. I thought that was sneaky. Wi-Fi was not free. 

Everything in the room worked fine except the air conditioning. It would emit this loud buzzing sound until I shut it down and re-start. This was very annoying. The first time I heard it, I opened my door to look in the hallways because I thought it was a fire alarm, then finally realized that it was coming from the air conditioning unit above my room door. I didn't bother calling house keeping, because it was late, I was tired and since I was checking out in the morning I tolerated it. 

I used the video check-out, but noticed a discrepancy with the bill, so had to go to the registration desk. Again, a bunch of people scattered here and there, but couldn't make out a 'line'. Once I got to an open station it went quickly and the service was friendly. The customer service rep cleaned up my bill without a fuss. My bill had multiple room service charges, even though I hadn't ordered any room service, nor had anything from the mini bar.

Speaking of the room, once I finally received a key, I entered my room and was extremely happy.  I stayed in the Octavius Tower, which was divine.  The bathroom was clean and spacious, the bed linens were soft, and the bed itself was plush (for a hotel).  There was a sofa and chair in the room, which I didn't get to use, but they definitely added to the feel of the room making it comforting and ""homey"".

The room service was stellar.  The pizza I ordered came within 30 minutes and the server laid everything out for me. 

Overall, the hotel itself is really nice.  The place is huge, so you can easily get lost in there.  But, most hotels in Vegas are big.

Room:   So we came for NYE again and we like to watch the fireworks from our room and not the throngs.  Seems like a great view of the strip. Definitely a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The room itself was fine. Big, with a jacuzzi tub.  Strange that one of the pillow cases had a mystery stain on it, but they brought more pillows.  Was annoyed that they Nickel and dime you for water.  Heh - I mean charge $7 for a bottle of water!   With the prices we are paying for the room, come on guys - give complimentary water!  Another thing I hate is that they have a fridge for their own pay bar.  If I had leftovers I can't use the fridge.  So - just a room with a pretty view and weak amenities...

Room service:  ordered breakfast for 8:30 and it arrived promptly.  We each had eggs Benedict.  It was overpriced and underwhelming.  The eggs were cooked well, but the hollandaise was cold and congealed.  The hashbrowns had entirely too much Italian seasoning.  And that was all.  I guess being as how it is caesars you expect more?  A garnish? Idk


Casino:  If you don't mind smoke, the casino is pretty. But we don't smoke, and the ventilation is terrible.  So we both woke up with the flavor of ashtray in our throats.  Bleh.  Oh!  And when we finally do gamble - are all the dealers miserable or what??? Gracious

Caesars in Atlantic City is nice, so I thought, since this one is in Vegas it would be nicer.  From the outside, it looks nice, iconic and gives you an aura worthy of a Vegas casino.  Then you got one of the nicest shopping centers in Vegas, a can't miss, the Caesar's Forum.  But after entering the casino, I thought there was nothing extraordinary about it.  It is large, but the slots are dated.  The table games are expensive with rude dealers. The rooms are standard hotel rooms not worthy of a Vegas moment.  I was surprised.  They want to pretend that they are one of elite casino, but it really isn't.  Great mid-strip location, but the way they build the casino, it is a far far walk from the nearest casinos.  It is ironic, but it's kind of isolated in the middle of the strip.  No great restaurants, just your standard chain places.  I come to Vegas a lot.

When we got to the room it looked like something out of the 1970's. There was an ugly rug that had a pattern that resembled roaches. The window was dirty, the view was obstructed, the tub was plastic and worst of all the bed was hard as nails. We woke up with sore backs. We also woke up to the sound of hammering at 8 in the morning. UNACCEPTABLE! This place is a fortune. I could have had an experience like this at a cheap motel off strip. You might as well be sleeping on the floor. We tried too add money and get a more upgraded room but that room was just roomier with a non-obstructed view. Same 1970's decor, same hard as nails bed. After that we got our money back and went back to our original crappy room. We had tried the biggest upgrade we could get and still thought it was a joke.

The pool area was impressive but there were not enough free chairs for people to sit in. I understand every hotel wants to make as much as they can but this is just an insult. The pools are very pretty but still not worth all that you have to put up with. We had called expedia to try to get out of this hotel stay. These travel sites have a guarantee and will do their best to change your stay if you're not happy. We had done this before but Ceasars would not let us out. They held us hostage until the last day.

My dad worked for Caesar's for 20+ years, and when all was said and done he managed the dice pit of the place and also took charge of the high roller suites from time to time.  (Not the high roller room, mind you.  We're talking the private places where people like, oh, I don't know, the Sultan of Brunei plays.)  So I grew up here and I have a particular affinity for it.  However, this does not downplay its grandeur.

Caesar's has the distinction of being the only older resort on the Strip that is not in imminent danger of being imploded.  Why is this?  Well, for one, they have the ability to keep up with the times.  In a city like Vegas, you have to be current.  Caesar's keeps its timeless feeling of class while staying relevant to young people and 'old timers' who want the feeling of 'old Vegas' alike.  It's classy without being intimidating, beautiful without being too gaudy, and hip without carrying an iPod.

The Forum Shops are being imitated time and again in other resorts, bur Caesar's did it first and did it best.  Cleopatra's Barge is just as booming as it was the first time her famous bosoms hung over that walkway.  And, seriously, the David replica?  It's almost more famous than the ACTUAL David.

I've stayed in their rooms twice in my life:  Once during a high school friend's birthday party, and once on my wedding night.  (Just to clarify, the wedding was beautiful.  The marriage?  Not so much, and that's over now.)  I stayed in a 'regular' room for my friend's party.  There were just a few of us - we weren't real partiers - but man, was that room gorgeous for a standard, run of the mill room.  It was smallish but opulent.  The bed and pillows invited you to sink into them and the bathrooms probably rivaled Liberace's.

For my wedding, my father pulled some strings and got us a King Suite.  It was airy and spacious, and the decoration was immaculate.  The bathroom was entirely floored and walled with marble.  A giant whirlpool tub soothed my aching be-corseted muscles, and I had to hop into the giant waterfall marble shower just to say I had.

Caesar's took care of my father well.  He enjoyed his employ there and they always let him know that they appreciated his work.  What is awesome is that they extend that welcome to all their visitors.  Please, visit Caesar's.  And, while you're there, tip your hat to the sky and say hi to my pops.

My husband and I waited until almost 6pm (we arrived a before 1pm) and finally called down to see if our room was ready.  It was!  So I happily went down to pick up the keys.

Went back down to the front desk and talked to the same incompetent woman who checked us in  and gave me the wrong key (Emma), and she didn't even know which room the was supposed to be our 4th room!  Asked for the manager (David), who was able to figure it all out.  Asked for the contact # of the head of the front desk staff, he told me a woman's name.

Es befindet sich in bester Lage am Strip und wirkt mit seinen vielen Towern gewaltig und ist seit meinem letzten Besuch vor über 20 Jahren einfach riesig geworden.

Das Top-Hotel verfügt über 3.960 Gästezimmer und Suiten in sechs verschiedenen Türmen, die nach und nach in der Vergangenheit gebaut wurden. Es ist eines der wenigen älteren Hotels, das in Las Vegas überlebt hat und nicht der Abriss und Bauwut zum Opfer gefallen ist. Es war auch schon Schauplatz diverser Filme, so wurden Szenen von ""Rainman"" und ""Hangover"" dort gedreht.

Spieler kommen im exklusiven Spielkasino mit einer Fläche von ca. 15.000 Quadratmetern auf ihre Kosten. Neben 2000 Slot-machines kann man bei Baccarat, Blackjack, Poker, Caribbean Stud Poker, Keno Craps, Let It Ride, Pai Gow Poker, Roulette, Sportsbook und Wheel of Fortune sein Glück versuchen.

Mein Highlight sind die luxuriösen Forum Shops mit über 160 Geschäften und Restaurants. Hier findet man Boutiquen wie Gucci, Bernini, Versace und Luis Vuitton, aber auch andere günstigere Labels. Auf dem Kunsthimmel kann innerhalb einer Stunde von der Morgendämmerung bis zum Abendrot ein ganzer Tag simuliert werden.

Stars wie Mariah Carey, Sir Elton John, Céline Dion, Rod Stewart und Cher treten regelmäßig für horrende Gagen im ""Caesars Palace"" auf. Allerdings ist das Unternehmen mit seinen zahlreichen Kasinos mittlerweile in die finanzielle Schieflage geraten, so musste man aufgrund der 23 Milliarden Schulden im Januar Insolvenz anmelden. Davon haben wir allerdings bei unserem Besuch nichts mitbekommen.

Die Servicebereitschaft des Personals ist vorbildlich, so hat mich einer der Bediensteten einen gefühlten Kilometer durch das Kasino begleitet, damit ich den Aufzug zu den Parkplätzen gefunden habe. Für mich immer noch eines der schönsten Hotels am Las Vegas Boulevard.",110,96,109

First we were issued one of the Augustus Tower rooms, one of the nicest towers, but when I requested an UPGRADE for two instead of one beds, we were not only downgraded, but was issued a different room at the opposite tower which was your basic stay room with nothing fancy.  The room, I will tell you now, is just like any other room on the strip if you were looking for something comfortable.  There is nothing fancy about a basic room at Caesars so definitely save your money for another hotel OR get a better room at Caesars if you want the full experience.  In addition, there was lipstick found on the bedsheets upon entering the room, the light shades were a bit broken, and the view faced the side parking lot.  We asked repeatedly for a different room but EVERYTHING was booked that weekend.

Stayed here for a bachelorette\/bachelor weekend with my husband. Booked our stay through Southwest Vacations which included the Classic room. Fellow Yelpers suggested the old $20 bill under the credit card trick to get an upgrade.

We went ahead and asked for an upgrade. The clerk agreed. We slid the $20 but she graciously refused the tip... and now we know why.

Room was supposedly an upgrade which has to be hotel-speak for a higher floor. But even then it was on the 15th floor with a view of the parking lot below. Nothing special about the room at all.

Overall, everything was clean and in working order.

If you are injured and it is their fault, they turn you over to CCMSI which is their 3rd party adjuster and they NEVER have any intention of repaying you for your costs associated with the injury. My grandmother, my mom, myself and two others stayed in a suite at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas from June 18 to June 22, 2012.

The morning we were to leave, my 84 year old grandmother entered the restroom and fell into the wall hitting her head. There was water totally covering the floor due to a cracked toilet. She had out of pocket expenses associated with her testing and follow up care. There is a two year statute of limitations to recoup your expenses. She and my mom talked with the claim adjuster on a regular basis. Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. (CCMSI) first adjuster was Joy Van Riper. She was replaced by Doug Buchanan in 2014. Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.

We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.

Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, ""That's my job."" Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.

We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.

So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.

PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country.

I saw a Palace Tower deluxe room with the jacuzzi that a friend was upgraded to, and it looked very nice. However, our Roman Tower room was outdated and very, very blah. The room had an old CRT television that had interference at times. The carpet had stains that were unsightly, but not necessarily unsanitary.  The ""closet"" was an open rack in the bathroom behind the door, which was terribly inconveniently placed for two people trying to get ready. The cables for the internet and TV were just  laying in a pile next to the entertainment center.

The view of the pool was the best part. of the room, but that wasn't enough to make me feel like I was getting value.

Ironically, when I went to visit the Palace Tower room, I saw a sign that said something like ""pardon us while we remodel"".  Well, I didn't see any dust or inconvenience.  Perhaps a similar sign should be placed in the Roman Tower: ""Pardon us while we remodel everything except this ancient wing of the hotel.""

Also, one of the elevators in the Roman Tower was malfunctioning for 36 hours before it was addressed. People were getting stuck in it and it would be the only elevator called to a floor, but then you couldn't go anywhere.  Frustrating.

I understand the Roman Tower is the lowest tier room, but I know you can get better quality for a better price at many other premier strip hotels.

The pool was nice with comfy chaises and a good pool temp. But the music blaring from the Venus pool was mixing with the regular pool music and making for some bad mashups. Not well thought out.

During checkout, the line was HUGE at 11 am (checkout deadline). Understandable, but after the line got out of hand and we were all not moving for about 15 minutes, nearly a half dozen staff came out to man more spots on the desk. If these people were here, how were you not prepared for the 11 am checkout barrage.  Dumb!

As for the casino, I think it's solid, but quickly being overshadowed by newer properties. I used to be a big fan of this sports book, but after seeing some of the newer ones around town, I think I'd go elsewhere.

Proximity to good restaurants is a plus. Mesa Grill was awesome, but I'm not planning to return to Rao's.",0,0,0

As much as we didn't have any luck winning at this hotel, it was a fun place to look at and walk around. The area where most of the tables were was kind of boring, even the dealers didn't say much to you.  There was an area with tables called The Pussycat Dolls & that was a more lively area. They played music, had leopard chairs & pink tables. The dealers were a lot more friendly on that end. The show with the statues is always nice to look at. They have lots of stores like Fendi, LV, Coach, Jimmy Choo etc. Very nice casino! The sports bar was outrageous! All of these big screens with all different sports showing. I thought that was really cool. It was the nicest casino I've been to so far in my opinion. Celine Dion, Elton John & Shania Twain all play here & you hear lots of their music & see their faces on tables & chips. A huge casino & it was easy to find things to do if we weren't gambling.

Directly behind that is good ol Caesars Palace. Of the Caesars (formally Harrah's) Entertainment chain of gambling sanctuaries, CP would likely be considered the grand daddy (i.e. flagship) of them all.

Casino wise, CP has little to frown about. There are thousands of slot machines for grandma pulley and her double player cart inserts and a couple hundred tables for Daddy Warbucks and his love for roulette, pai gow, or BJ ... errr 21. It should be noted that they also feature a table or two for progressive blackjack, Caribbean stud, and even Spanish 21. A rarity indeed for most casinos that don't have these games available during all hours.

The high limit area is impressive. There are a few dozen high limit slot machines with denominations of $100-500 and a vast staff for private dealers of any mainstream house game. Poker players, there's even rooms for you all as well, and they're quite pretty. No guarantee you'll receive any comps of course, best ride the coat tails of the high limit players.

TotalRewards has undergone a variety of changes over the last few years. While most Diamond \/ 7 Star players might not have issues securing amenities at CP, know that point poolers will see a huge drop off comp worthy points. That said, the standards are higher here, so don't be surprised your baller status at nearby Bally's doesn't exactly translate to an instant reservation at Guy Savoy.

The hungry will never feel that way at CP. From the laughable Augustus Cafe to the various yet random Chinese themed spots to the Mesa Gril, there is no shortage of interesting eateries throughout the resort. Guy Savoy has my allegiance, as does lunches at Bradley Ogden. Old Homestead is a classic steakhouse spot and Hyakumi actually serves a mean plate of raw fish. What I'm really looking forward to is next week's opening of Bacchanal Buffet (500+ items, 17 million to create), which has been rumored to be the next greatest all you can eat venue in the city.

Shoppers are guaranteed to appreciate CP, after all, it's one of the only properties that can boast something as robust as the Forum Shops - a semi high-end mall of just about anything. It's a tourists haven, but not necessarily a trap. Locals aren't likely to purchase much here since the dollar doesn't go that far, but like all fun shopping - it's fun to look.

The pools (cheesily named ""Garden of the Gods"") are actually more decent than they sound and each one has a theme \/ gimmick. Most of them have cabanas, but beware of paying retail for these (hello comp points!), as there are way better pool cabanas along and beyond the strip. I'm a fan of the Neptune, only because its the most social pool where you can mingle and get your splash \/ tan on at the same time.

Beyond the usual amenities, CP boasts the Colosseum, one of the best concert venues in the city. I've seen a lot from Celine to International pop stars do their thing here. It truly is a sight and sound pumping venue to behold. The property also sports one of the largest parking structures on the strip, I've yet to NOT find a space here. If you feel like clubbin and are in an overly pretentious mood, Pure (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/pure-las-vegas) might be the place for you. But a word to the wise - bottles are not only expensive here, but the service has been notoriously bad. Pretending you're a celebrity might be a better move than attempting to buy your way in.

Finally, the onsite amenities are the real draw. People who are complaining of the antiquated cheesy Roman themes are probably staying in the Forum, Roman, or Palace tower. For the complete and modern contemporary version of CP's finest rooms, shoot for the Augustus, even if its a regular room. I promise it's worth it.",15,5,7

The best part of the hotel is their pool area and also their Augustus Cafe which had prompt service and great late night eats ( Club Sandwhich and Caeser salad!!!). Housekeeping was friendly and did a good job cleaning. 

CONS:
1) We got a room with two bathrooms thinking that would be helpful for four girls. Nah. The problem is that there is one big connecting shower. Whats the point of that? We cant shower together, ew. So I found that pointless and we should have maybe stayed at the Augustus tower if we had known this. 
2) The pillows are BAD. Probably as old as the hotel. 
3) The room was huge but seriously, the beds look miniature in this room. They were two double beds, and seriously looked like Full size. Not even a queen. 
4) Half the room was empty. It could use some furniture. Also the handles to some of the furniture were broken. 
5) Older crowd, families and lots of weddings. Not really the right kind of scene for a bachelorette party. Venus pool was lame. It is not owned by Club Pure anymore, and its basically a Euro-Topless pool now with bad music playing. Boring. 

The worst part is that every time we called down for anything either A) they enver answered B) transferred to another person who never picked up. So annoying.

I love old school Vegas, and this has all of the history you would expect.  We met a couple at the pool who has been staying at Caesars for several decades, and they were reminiscing about the days when they saw Frank Sinatra perform here. And even though it is old school, I still felt that our stay was far more luxurious than when I stayed at the Trump, for example, which has none of the charm of Caesars.

I initially booked through a flash sale site for a room in the Forum Tower, but we were put into the Augustus Tower instead! This is the newest and most fabulous part of the hotel and also very close to the street and casino. Our room had a giant jacuzzi tub, marble bathroom with a TV, and lots of goodies. The only downsides: no free coffee in the room, and our room had 2 small beds instead of 1 large bed. (We could have moved our second night, but by then we were all settled in so decided to stay.)

The central location of the Augustus Tower is perfect for exploring the rest of the strip. We dropped off our car at the valet on Friday night and didn't see it again until Sunday. We didn't spend a dime on cabs, either. Everything is right there at your fingertips.

When my bf checked in on Foursquare, we learned that the original owner of the hotel decided to call it Caesars Palace instead of Caesar's Palace because he believed every guest is a Caesar during their stay. True to that, service at Caesars is outstanding, and they will really cater to your every desire. We ordered room service which was the best meal I had in Vegas. I highly recommend the Caesars Eggs Benedict with cornmeal crusted pork on ciabatta.

I have been to quite a few hotels on the strip, but felt I got more for my dollar at Caesar's Place!  I automatically got an upgrade because my daughter was celebrating her 21st birthday and so we went from the forum tower to the palace tower (room 2216) and had a wonderful view of the pools (Garden of the Gods) and mountains.  

From the palace tower elevators is the pool entrance and enjoyed the easy cabana layout.  They do have a topless pool which is the longer pool by the Palace tower.  The pool environment was wonderful for all ages!

The first stop was Payard Patisserie and Bistro, where every 15 minutes a chocolate comes out of the machine that was delicious!  There was also Serendipity3 which has the old fashion ""drugstore"" sundaes...strong suggestion, try it!!! Yum!!!

I didn't get to see any entertainment but as of July 2014, there is Celine Dion, Shania Twain (which has her own store) Rod Stewart and my favorite Elton John!

The only bar I sat down was the Seahorse lounge, it was an experience to drink by the big circular fish tank with the vibrant colors!

Another go to place is the ""Forum Shops"" that takes you through all the beautiful stores and of course the entertainment with the statues.  This is where everyone seems to like to hang out besides the casino!!

If you go by the parking lot elevators, there you will see some of the ""Hangover"" movie memorabilia, which always gives me a giggle to ask  ""Does Caesar live here""? :)

The total rewards system is great, it can follow you through out your casino experience as well as you can dine out at their other properties (which I did at Paris) and bill it to your room.  Bonus!!!

I have been to Vegas many times, typically I don't spend much on the room because it Vegas!!! Go out and do something!!! We were at Caesars for a convention and I wanted a room with a view. My original room was in the Palace Tower, did the $20 trick and was upgraded to Augustus Tower with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, Paris area. Best view I've had anywhere. Room was king bed, tons of space, jacuzzi tub for one, separate shower, flat panel tv you could see from the jacuzzi........totally sweet room, clean, classy, spacious. HIGHLY recommend the Augustus tower with a view. 

Although I donated my share of monies in the casino, there was a great selection of games, tables (although mins were higher than your average place) and bars. Drink service was outstanding wherever we were at in the casino or in a lounge. I'm not a nightclub person, although we did go to Pure one evening. Seemed nice, not my scene.....I'm more of a lounge person.

You have $1\/$2 machines mixed with the 25-cent and 1-cent games, while the roulette games are thrown in with the pop culture themed slots in another area like they're an after thought. 

The hotel itself is beautiful, hence why it's constantly cited in movies and the like. The Romanesque sculptures and architecture is definitely appealing--the exterior and interior; the lobby alone is gorgeous. The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace resembles an upscale mall, with both upscale boutiques and common stores. Aside from the Bacchanal, Caesar's has great restaurants including Nobu and Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. Moreover, Caesar's is also one of the conveniently located hotels on the Strip; it's close to other major hotels, shows, restaurants, and other attractions.

The first time I stayed here, I stayed in the Augustus Tower - amazing view, huge soaking tub, flat screen TV in the bathroom, and generally a lovely room that was pristine. However, my last visit to Vegas this past weekend has changed my opinion of Caesar's. What I thought was an upscale luxury casino and hotel quickly became a disappointing, lackluster hotel, with rooms that were comparable to a Motel6. 

I had 3 nights booked and once I checked in, I was thoroughly disappointed with the accommodations. The first night, I stayed in the Roman Tower. Clearly one of the oldest towers, if not THE oldest tower at the resort. I requested a high floor and a room close to the elevator. I was put in the room farthest from the elevator and on the fifth floor. I had the not-so-awesome view of the top of the vents of the casino. The ice machine on the fifth floor didn't work either.

I called the front desk to explain that I wasn't exactly thrilled with the room. The first time I called, it seemed like I was disconnected randomly. I called again and was able to speak to someone after holding a couple of minutes. The front desk attendant said he heard that the lower floors were having issues with the ice machines and that he would send a bucket of ice to my room from room service free of charge. This didn't fix the problems of the moldy smelling hallways, torn curtains, and overall disgusting room. Because the hotel was booked for the night, they weren't able to move me to a different tower, but then I was told that I should try again the next day because there were going to be some openings.

I ended up calling the front desk 5 different times - each time, the attendant told me something different. ""I wasn't aware the ice machines weren't working."" ""There isn't any availability in other towers."" ""The only higher floors are smoking floors."" ""The whole tower is a non-smoking tower."" ""I can move you to a higher floor."" ""There's no availability on a higher floor."" I even went to the Total Rewards counter to see if they would have more success because I was there as a VIP. The Total Rewards assistant really tried her best, but it seemed as if she was dealing with the same incompetent group of people on the phone - considering, she was placed on hold for a good 10 minutes. 

I eventually made my way to the front desk and spoke to someone - which was the best way to go. The attendant (I think her name was Tiffany) spoke to her manager and she was given the go-ahead to move me to another tower if there was availability. Amazingly, she was able to find a room in the Palace Tower and she efficiently made the changes to my reservation. The Palace Tower is MUCH nicer than the Roman Tower - not as shiny and new as the Augustus Tower, but still nice enough. The windows were on the dirty side and the furnishings were older - a couple of knobs were missing from the TV stand, etc. 

I probably wouldn't pick Caesars for an upcoming trip to Vegas again. If I do, I'll be sure to specifically request the Augustus tower because I'd rather never step foot into the Roman Tower again in its current state.",4,0,0

To describe this hotel in one word is ""Grand."" Caesar's Palace isn't just a hotel. It's a city; I wouldn't be surprised if they had their own unique zip code.

Architecture: Yeah yeah I know, it's Vegas; of course they have an endless amount of funds to build whatever they want. But still, I have to say that I was amazed & couldn't resist admiring the amount of craftsmanship put into every little inch of this place. The close attention to detail on their replicas of Rome landmarks is pretty incredible.

Food: We tried a few things at their food court. The pastrami & corned beef sandwich at BARBQ with the fries from the restaurant identified with no name, but a picture of a burger. Fries were bomb, and the sandwiches were pretty good. We also got the macho nachos at Ole! which comes in a giant bowl, the two of us got full off of just that. We also tried the Trevi restaurant which sits in the middle of their shopping forum by their beautiful fountain - I'll have a separate review for Trevi soon. I haven't tried their main Italian restaurant, the Raos, but we'll mos def try it next time.

Shopping Forum: The pretty much have everything here: LV, Gucci, Burberry, Tiffany's, Banana Republic, and a bunch of overpriced brands that I can't even pronounce.

Pool: I've been to other pools in Vegas and I've gotta say that Caesar's has my favorite pool. There's actually 5 pools here all located in one area, but one main one. The main is designed so that it's more like a fountain, where a statue\/monument type of thing is in the middle and the pool water surrounds it - quite beautiful. A small pina colada at the bar here is $14. eek. Another cool thing is they have tables to gamble at in one of the 5 pools. The players are waist-deep in the pool while they play at tables, while the dealers stand in the middle of the dry area of the pool - cool!!!

Room: The suite we had here was no ""Hangover"" status. Supposedly we were put in one of their older towers, so the tv & technology is a little outdated. At one of our mornings the bathroom lights just would not turn on for a while. This is my one and only gripe I have about Caesar's. Regardless of whether a tower has been made recently or was the first one made, they should do whatever they can to keep even their older towers updated to keep every single one of their rooms relevant. For a place like Caesar's, updating\/maintaining their rooms shouldn't be hard at all. Goodness, if they just sold one of their millions of statue replicas that's hidden away in the corner of their rooftops that nobody looks at, I'm sure it would accommodate for their fees to update their older rooms.

Conclusion - awesome place to play and stay at, check it out whenever you get the chance!",1,1,1

What else I like about Caesars Palace:

1.  The atmosphere and decorations are cool.
2.  The casino ventilation is much better than most other Vegas hotels.

You can shop, eat and play your heart out here for your entire trip if you'd like. Though I feel Caesars can use a slight face lift to stay classy, I also know it is going in the right direction. Case in point, Omnia nightclub. Its moves like creating one of the best, if not the best, nightclub on the strip that makes me feel like I'm never going to waste my time by heading to Caesars. I'd like to see it continue its renaissance by parlaying its nightclub with better shows, headliners and pool parties but as we know, Rome was not built in a day!

I must first start out by writing I only chose to stay at Caesars because I was offered a complimentary stay and a $300 dining credit. When I arrived, I received a call in my room telling my which restaurants I could choose (so I was aware that the hotel knew the restaurant choices). The following night I visited the concierge so I could hear the list again since I didn't have a pen when the call was received the night prior. A restaurant was recommended to me as was instructions on how to claim the dining credit (since it was my first time using a credit). Unfortunately, the concierge was incorrect and that restaurant wasn't covered by the voucher. More unfortunate was the price of the bill. I had to pay $380 for a dinner at a restaurant that I didn't want to eat at, but was presumed to be free (for the first $300 anyway).

I understand the concierge made a mistake with the restaurant, but the hotel front desk and the concierge would not honor the mistake or even credit me for a future voucher. I'm confused that as a marketing tool, Caesars offered me a dining credit to entice me to stay at their hotel in the future but would rather lose thousands in opportunity costs for retaining me as a future loyal customer than honor a $300 mistake. Bottom line: I trusted their concierge, was extremely let down, and will never stay at Caesars again. There are plenty of great hotels in Las Vegas that understand the importance of loyal service and how it is cheaper for a hotel to retain customers than find new ones, and I'll be loyal to the first hotel that can demonstrate that they value my business. P.S. I spend thousands on gambling and entertainment every time I visit. It's not about the $300, it's about the service.

Pretty hotel though..",1,0,0

Caesar's Palace is a great place to go with a few girlfriends and just chill in the gorgeous pools. Or a great venue for a bachelorette or bachelor party. The hotel has been around for years, but the columns everywhere make you feel like you're in Rome. There's lots of competition on the strip and hotels know this. There are always great deals with Caesar's Palace. 

Top headliners work out of this hotel: 
Jerry Seinfeld (September 18 & 19, 2015)--GO SEE JERRY SEINFELD some time in your life, cause we all know how funny he really is, but go, cause you will laugh and won't regret the price of a good ticket. If there's one comedy show you should see in your lifetime, it's JERRY. For me, when the show was over, my mouth was permanently stuck in a laugh, from laughing non-stop. I don't remember the comedian's name who warmed up for Jerry, but he was almost as good as Jerry. I was highly impressed with this show. Be prepared to pay big bucks for a close seat. There are plenty of TV's around the Colosseum if you're seated in the nosebleed section, like I was, at $100\/seat.

Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Elton John, Reba McEntire, and others all are performing here at Caesar's Palace's Colosseum. 

There are lots of 5 star restaurants here, including Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. Nobu, Gordon Ramsey's restaurant & several others are located here.

Caesar's Palace is all about excess, everywhere. It's a Palace, after all. Both pools and rooms are gorgeous. I especially love they have many pools (7-of the Seven Gods), and they go up in opulence and amenities, depending on what pool you like that day. Nice to be able to have that choice. This hotel charges each 'visitor over 21' a fee when they come to visit friends, and to be able to hang out together at the pools. Both Caesar's Palace and Nobu Hotel use these pools, so they can sometimes get crowded.

Love this place though, and would go back in a heartbeat.",2,2,2

So basically I was on the expo floor talking to customers for hours... and then I would go back to my room... collapse and then roust myself and go back and do it again...

So I wanted food, a bed, that nice big tub with the jet, peace and quiet and whatever service I required... given quietly, with cheer and yet not too much and you know what?

That's the difference between a slightly ""old school"" hotel like Caesar's and a maybe hipper newer place like the Cosmo...  My room was great for my business trip.

If I had brought someone with me - I might have been disappointed because it was a mix of really great and then slightly cut corners here and there... so yes, I'd have been not happy with having been trying to ""impress a girl"" with it...

however... it's where i'd bring my Wife... Because Caesar's is 5 star service all the way.  If you know what that is... REALLY know what that is... then you know what I mean.  Unobtrusive... cheerful, quietly giving you what you want, when you didn't even know it's what you wanted.

For example. Room service... they offer to come back and clear the dishes an hour later. And they do.  That little added effort where they don't make you call them to come get the plates...  of course you want them cleared... that's the difference.

yea... the suite at TheHotel was more Impressive or the Balcony or Japanese Soaking Tub View of the Belaggio Fountain I had at the Cosmo last time... yes that is what I would bring someone who I was courting (yea, I was on another business trip and alone... ha.) but they made me call them to get my dishes and i Had to wait for them like two hours... and I ended up putting them outside the door so I could crash. So they forced ME to act trashy... ;)

I was surprised. I'd actually never stayed at Ceasars although I have dined and visited and enjoyed the casino...

         It's not cheap, but our room was top notch. One of the most overused (but true) cliches is ""You get what you pay for"".  The room was spacious, exceptionally clean, and we had an awesome view of the strip from our window. However, my favorite feature was the giant jacuzzi tub with large roman tapestry designs on each size (I'm a sucker for large bathes). 
         My only minor complaint was with the room service. Our breakfast was about 15 minutes late and they forgot our sides. I know that sounds a little nit-picky, but for the price paid for the service, I felt it needed to be flawless.  
         I also appreciated the large fountain and aquarium in the shopping area and all the roman replica statues and busts. The casino\/shopping  area have a lot cool little details so be sure to look around.

This is my 2nd time staying at this hotel, I wasn't impressed the first go around and even more disappointed this 2nd go around. 

First off our check in started off on a bad note immediately. The young lady who was checking us in was extremely rude and when we tried to tell her we had booked a room with two beds she insisted that we had not done so, and continued to brush us off when we provided her our confirmation for our reservation which stated two double beds. 

So after a lot of back and forth with the bed situation we head up to the 12th floor to try and access our room # indicated on our key and to our surprise the door has a ""do not disturb"" flyer hanging from it. So that was strange we proceeded to try and scan our way in our room but nothing we tried numerous times with all the keys we had and still nothing. So we decided to knock since we could hear someone in the room and thought it could be the cleaning lady, and next thing you know a man comes out of the room. We felt so embarrassed standing there while trying to access the room that was given to us.  

From there we head back down to the lobby and a new front desk agent which was much more kinder assisted us and found out that the other agent had given us the incorrect room # to begin with and that was why the reservation only had one bed instead of two like we insisted to her in the very beginning when we were trying to check in. 

Finally we enter our room and to my surprise it's still EXTREMELY OUT DATED, and why I say STILL is because I stayed at this hotel before back in 10\/13\/11 - 10\/16\/2011. The room looked exactly the same, super old and crusty. To top it off they only provided (2 people) from each party access to their WI-FI, which of course didn't work for us since we had booked a room for 4 people and paid for 4 people NOT TWO! 

The room itself is very old and crusty NO FRIDGE, NO COFFEE POT, NO MICROWAVE, NO MINI BAR, NO BATH ROBE, NO IPOD PLAYER (they have a super old cd player by the bed), and their wall panels to charge our phones weren't all working so we had to take turns using the few that did work. Also, their phone to call the front desk wasn't working so there was no way to reach anyone in the lobby without actually traveling from 12th floor to the lobby. Not to mention that the phone that they had outside of the elevator didn't work either to reach them. And their check out option via their TV didn't work either, so we had to wait in a long as line in the lobby just to check out when it could have been avoided.  

One thing that really annoyed me that could have been an easy fix on the hotels end was that we wanted to really enjoy our window view from our room which over looked the pool but we couldn't because the whole window was plastered with water spots. For a hotel that charges so much damn money you would think they would quit being so damn ghetto and stingy. Since I wasn't able to get a good photo from our bedroom window due to how dirty our window was I figured id go take one from the elevators since we were on the 12th floor, and here we go again the one big window that over looked the pool in front of the elevators on the 12th floor is ALSO completely dirty and plastered with water spots all over it. So i was not able to get a single photo from any of our windows... 

ALL IN ALL I MUST SAY THIS HOTEL IS GARBAGE!! WAS GARBAGE WHEN I STAYED HERE IN 2011 AND IS STILL GARBAGE NOW IN 2015. NOT WORTH THE PRICE TO STAY HERE, THE ONLY THING THIS HOTEL HAS GOING FOR IT IS THEIR POOL, EVERYTHING ELSE IS A WASTE.",8,1,1

When you enter for the event it is organized, short lines and a helpful staff (a comforting start). There are bars located periodically throughout the venue and it makes the lines shorter than most other places. Drinks of course are outrageously priced but that is to be expected. 

The show itself, words can not explain how amazing it was. So organized and entertaining. There was really never a dull moment when it came to the performance of the beautiful Shania Twain on the beautiful colosseum stage. 

Staff walks around the audience snapping photos at your seats and this is great because I have never seen this done before and it is a great way to get the memory captured on a better quality camera then a cellphone if you're an average joe like me.

My problems started at check in, I arrived at 1:30 pm, check in is at 4-6pm. At first I was told my room type wasn't ready, ok. Then I was told he could get it for me for 30 extra check in fee. So again working in this industry and working with Mgm Resorts, Caesars, Wynn etc.  I'm used to the sales pitch, so I'm no beginner here. I kindly explained that to the agent. Who by the way was not nice to start out with. Moving on, so I didn't want to pay the 30 extra, then he tells me my room won't be ready until 6 pm. But if I paid it would be ready now., I talk to a manager of the front desk. I ask the right questions, and she's talking to me and I can see it in her eyes and in her speech that she knows this charge is bs., I also let her know what the agent stated before. I reiterated everything back to them to make sure I didn't sound crazy, and they agreed., but 30.00 check in fee was mandatory if I wanted my room before 4-6. I said ok, fine I'll pay it. I did it to see if their attitude changed, nope. She pressed enter and walked away. No thank you, have a good day, etc. Again working in this industry their standards are high, so they teach them how to talk to and greet guests, they do this to make the guests want to come back and stay again. Moving along, he processes my check in and charges my card for the night stay and 200 deposit, however I had a pre paid stay. He explains to me it will come off my card within 7-10 business days. Hands me my keys and keeps working. I said kindly and nicely to him, have a nice day. He said nothing back, so I said it louder and he fixed his watch and said it back with a bad attitude. 

Now for the room, this room was part of their laurel collection, so I wanted to see them and enjoy the comforts. Room was clean, but the bathroom you can see there was flood damage on the foot of the walls, and door was moldy and painted over. There's nothing Lux about this room, at all & to pay 100.00 more per night is a waste. 

There are no rugs in the bathroom, cold marble is all you get with a touch of mold. No robes to wear around the room, no laundry bag for dirty laundry. There's a keurig coffee machine but no k cups? No luggage valet so your bag doesn't have to sit on the floor. No central light switch to turn the lights on, you have to walk around the room and turn them on one by one, towels are old and rough. I wanted to like it here, I won't stay here again. 

Now for the check out, I went to check out on the tv. It didn't work, it kept failing and having an error. Go downstairs to the kiosks that say Check in and Check out, check out button is gone. So I left, I didn't check out with anyone. So I'll probably get a 30.00 charge for that as well.",7,6,2

No one help us or try to take care of this case for us
Until I decided to call the 911 from the hotel phone
That's the only number I know 
when I'm in the unsafe situation 
I think that's only one can help us after the we went through all this 
And hotel workers are making it worse and worse
Finally the hotel security came to my room tried to help after I just done the conversation with the police officer in the phone.
This two security workers is the only person and the first one to help us
They help us to filled up the report and even walked us down to the lobby Wait for the customer manager name David says he gonna come take care of us
But he didn't 
We wait again he sent one of his hotel supervisor 
Alpha 
First Alpha tried to just gave us free dinner to fix the whole thing 
But this is just making it more unacceptable!!
Not about this damn dinner 
Every ones life are short 
time are expensive after the we went through all that
Really?!!! Just sent one of your hotel supervisor to messing around with us
She even tried  to hold the customer complain form in her hands 
She even tried to not let us touch that customers complain form
She can't even make her own decisions to handle this situation!!
How many time she ran in to the office to ask or get permission from this hotel manager David who promise will come and take care of us 
Last she came back 
Said ""we will not charge you guys for tonight hotel room but no dinner not anything else.""
Wow!!!!That was  just SO RUDE!!!
No matter A regular guests or A VIP guests 
When some unsafe emergency situations happen to your customers 
We should get same customers service when is turning to a emergency
Or your company needs us to pay for it then we can get better customers service form you?
I think no one with have problems with that
We can afford to buy the better customers service from you 
Just make the list
I buy your Smile $5 
And buy you Being helpful to customers cost $20
Being more and more helpful cost $50
How's it? Then you shut your mouth do not complain 
If the money could fix the problem then there it's no problem 
Just like you guys threw those a free night room and a free dinner on our faces
I know your owner own the half of new Las Vegas
But that's not the right way to serve the customers 
That's no way to trick your customers like shit and 
Build half of your town",8,8,0

My fiance is a wounded warrior and can't stand for prolonged periods of time. We called the concierge and they said they would make necessary accommodations if we let them know. We spoke to someone working at the front that said we could pull a number sit down and come back when our time slot came. Little did we know that we had to stand in line at the time we pulled. We explained our situation again to the cashier lady and she laughed in his face and said that we must be joking. He could not be a wounded warrior and retired since he was so young. We were in shock and disbelief that someone could be so rude. We complained to the manager and the front desk because we felt very disrespected and all they did was casually apologize and said it would be investigated. 
A couple weeks later he called corporate numerous times with no response. Then he gets a letter in the mail stating that this incident could possibly not have happened because they were rated the number one buffet in vegas..what B.S.",3,0,0

We were checked in to a room where the shower is like a rubrics cube. U have to work a little magic to turn it on. No joke. The wall even has damage to it. The wallpaper was peeling. Also I called house keeping for some robes because it was not in our room. The lady told me they do not have robes anymore that they had totally stopped using it. So I said ok just send me 4 towels coz I have my son with me. The lady said ok I'll have it brought up now. We waited and fell asleep and no one came. Waited again the next morning till 10am nothing came. I had to call again. I asked for 4 towels again. 5 mins later a guy came and brought us towel. My bf asked his if he can grab us 2 robes too. 5 mins later they broght us 2 robes. So yeah the lady I spoke to the night before lied to me. I was so upset.  
This was a room given to a diamond rewards member by the way. 
Next was the time when we went for a group get together. me and the bf stayed in Caesar palace. OMG! The toilet in our room in the agustus tower kept clogging up. Seriously we would not go number 2 only number 1 and it would just clog up. I had to call someone Everytime we used it. I was so irritated by this. 

I am seriously about to give up on Caesar palace. Not worth the time anymore.",6,4,2

You know, Pizza! Pizza!  So I had low expectations when I heard we were going to stay there during our trip to Vegas.  I anticipated a general aura of sleaze that was so not what we got.  

We stayed in the Palace Tower and were thrilled with our flat panel TV, HUGE room, comfy bed, jacuzzi tub and beautiful decor.  It was truly an oasis of calm and relaxation above the chaos of the strip.  And the shopping!!!  Good Lord!  It just kept going and going...I even got up the courage to try on a $4,000 Versace dress with gold heels ($800) and damn I looked good!  Just getting to try it on made my day.

The pools were gorgeous, but unfortunately it was so windy we weren't able to get in the water or hang out...  I thought the coffee at Rao's was better than the coffee at their food court...  We ate at the buffet and got gouged.  We went for lunch but got charged $6 more per person for ""brunch.""  That blew.

We usually stay at Bellagio next door, but decided to make this a ""budget"" trip and save a few $$$. I chose Caesars because we usually stop by the Forum Shops a few times, they have a few of my favorite restaurants (Mesa Grill, Border Grill, Nobu, Gordon Ramsay Pub, etc.), and my hubby smokes a cigar everyday at Casa Fuente or Montecristo. I figured we spend so much time at those places, why not give the hotel a chance to stay...

+ Awesome 4th of July fireworks show
+ Nice pool area with multiple pools
+ Great selection of restaurants and shops
+ Nice, large bathroom in Julius Tower
+ Super comfy bed 
+ Early check-in
+ Friendly staff
+ Clean

- Julius Tower room view sucked
- Thin walls
- Housekeeping was soooo loud every morning
- People and children running up and down the halls all day and night, laughing and talking loudly
- Ice machine but no vending machine on our floor
- Taxi stand was kind of slow and disorganized
- Not enough seating at the pool

Overall, we saved a few bucks, but I missed the peace and quiet, as well as luxury and ambiance, of Bellagio next door. I'll probably be going back to Bellagio next year and walking over to Caesar's to shop and dine.",11,1,2

I stayed at a recently renovated room and noticed many issues that should have been easily picked up by either a quick inspection of the room or by housekeeping. These issues included a bathroom door that wouldn't close due to the door being too large for the frame, the shelf in the shower being at a near 45 degree angle making it difficult to use, paint and scuff marks on furniture, and large scratches on the bathroom tile. I was willing to ignore these issues, mostly due to fear of getting a room that was even worse since they obviously didn't inspect the remodeling work properly. 

This morning, on the last day of my stay, I awoke at 6:30am to the sound of hammering and drilling directly above my room. The front desk confirmed this was renovation work...

The gaming it's what it is.  Didn't find a lot of new games (slots).   Normally if you game you drink for free.  A word of caution some of the bar slots have a green light system.  Which means you need to play a bit before you get free service.   You can always buy your own drinks.  

The sleeping room are scattered across a 1\/2 dozen towers.   Julius' tower claiming to be a newer towers was nice.  Basic room!  Warning don't breathe on the snacks that are displayed in the room.  Seriously, you move one item and you might just buy a $50 fun size pack of M&Ms -- same goes for the fridge.  

The event space.  They should consider installing a monorail system to get the meeting space.  Bravo!  To the planner and the staff.  A huge ballroom was pack and we got a 3 course meal with an open bar and an awards ceremony and we were done in an hour and half.  I know you're thinking the rubber chicken meal.  Nope- 
Seafood cocktail - huge chunks of lobster and shrimp in a light tomato broth and an avocado cream.  Perfectly cooked and balanced.  
Filet with beef with sweet potato purée and veg - nicely cooked to medium.  Solid dish but I was saving room for dessert. 
Dessert was a trio - 1 chocolate macaroon which I believe was from Payard. 1 chocolate Napoleon 1 vanilla mousse.   The chocolate portions were petite yet so rich I had no room for the mousse.

Como minha viagem para Vegas era para assistir o show da minha diva Celine Dion, nada como ficar no hotel onde ela se hospeda e onde respira-se Celine. 
O Hotel é um encanto, enorme, o teto dele muda de acordo com o tempo lá fora, ou seja, se está de noite, o teto fica escuro com estrelas, se está de dia, fica azul clarinho com nuvens. 
As lojas dentro do hotel são ótimas!!! Os restaurantes que ficam no hotel tem para todos os gostos, desde lanches rápidos até maravilhosos jantares. Confesso que a recepção do hotel não foi a das melhores, pois no dia em que cheguei com a minha irmã a atendente não estava muito de bom humor e foi um pouco ríspida conosco, mas logo depois o humor dela melhorou (do nada, vai entender) e correu tudo bem. Ai ai ai o que falar de um belo quarto, com duas entradas para o banheiro GIGANTE do quarto? Nesse banheiro tudo era duplo, duas pias, dois chuveiros, dois vasos sanitários (em cômodos reservados) vários espelhos etc...uma banheira enorme e um monte de toalhas...Sem contar os cremes, shampoo, condicionador e outros ""brindes"" que o quarto fornecia. A vista era incrível, dava para ver boa parte de Vegas da janela do quarto, além de ter um amplo espaço para DUAS CAMAS KING, poltronas, escrivaninha, tv, ar condicionado, armário e tudo entapetado, como já é de costume nos EUA. Além de tudo isso, você ainda têm uma ótima localização, bem como piscinas e vários tipos e tamanhos...além é claro dos casinos que o Caesars Palace oferece!!! E não poderia deixar de falar que como a Celine faz show e está hospedada nesse hotel, como disse acima, a música ambiente é toda dela, salvo em alguns lugares do casino, sem contar na loja dela, com um monte de coisa que você só encontra lá!!! E o show dessa mulher gente, foi emocionante, fico emocionada só de pensar. Bom, é isso pessoal, recomendo muito ficarem no Caesars Palace, NÃO TEM NADA DE RUIM LÁ, VOCÊS VÃO AMAR TUDO!!!!",3,2,3

Our experience at the front desk was great. The agent was very nice and did upgrade our room since it was my birthday. Sadly this is where things seemed to take a sharp turn left. We left our luggage with the bell desk, all of which was in tact. We were waiting about 40 minutes in the room for our things to come up when the bell hop called us and said they had taken our things to the wrong room. When he arrived one of the compartments on my suitcase was completely busted open and the zipper no longer worked. He said it was that way when he received it. We called the bell supervisor and told us the situation, emphasizing that the luggage was broken and it was not that way when it was left in their possession. He kept asking if it was really broken or not, as if we didn't know for sure. Finally after a while of back and forth, they agreed to have the suitcase repaired. We had to call multiple times to room service just for two forks and it took a long time to be delivered. Service on the floor was lackluster, especially from the beverage servers. One bright spot was our blackjack dealer, I think his name was Armando. He was very friendly and polite, and made losing money on the tables less painful. I will say that our room, which was on the 26th floor, was very nice. It had a great view of the pool area. Overall for this to be the infamous Caesars Palace, I left feeling unimpressed. Because of how nice our room was I would be willing to stay again in hopes of a better experience.",0,0,0

BUT HORRIBLE service! It took them 10 mins to sit us down with no one sitting down any where in the cafe, plus it took us 20 mins to get our food and 30 MINS to get our ticket! I was outraged!!! To me this is unacceptable! I dont care if its 4AM or not! It should take that long to get my bill! But I give them credit for the food it was really good. I had the waffles and eggs with bacon! I was very happy but it was putting me asleep! Which is a good thing I might add, but it took way to long to get my check. At this point I was tired and cranky and the beer buzz was gone! hehe But the hotel is nice and I like having a good time here. But i wasnt to happy with the room. It was average and nothing really im pressive about it. Other than the 3 by 3 inch tv's in the bathrooms. It was affordable and the service desk was very helpful with anything I needed I just think they need to update the rooms. Though I did enjoy the pool and that was alot of fun, did look a tad bit dirty but I blame that on the amount of people that come and go in that pool. But still was fun and enjoyable. I will give this 4 stars because i understand the hotel is old and perhaps seeing only about 15 years of its life now.. But over all I had a great time and enjoyed myself. But I would rather spend an extra 100 dollars and stay at the wynn or the hotel and get a tad bit more luxury. Thats my 2 cents.. But if you are looking for a good place and is very affordable..

I prepaid for 3 deluxe rooms at the new Octavius Tower and was expecting a smooth check-in process when my family and I arrived but no such luck.  Driving up to the South Entrance Exclusive entrance was smooth, the guy at Valet was nice and helpful!  Walk into the hotel and head towards check-in and the girl at the front desk was not the smartest.... I gave her my name and reservation numbers along with letting her know that I had paid our rooms in full prior to arrival.  She smugly replied to me with a ""we'll see about that"".  From there my registration experience only got worse,  it took her 20 minutes to verify that the rooms were paid in full and after that she proceeded to ask for a CC for incidental authorization which is customary in some hotels but for whatever reason she ended up charging $600 to the card instead of the authorization.  I asked her why and she said well since you already paid for your rooms the computer system won't allow me to just authorize $200 a room so I charged it and when you check out  the charges will be reversed.  Well I found this whole ordeal to be completely unacceptable being that Bellagio and Venetian did not do that and even worse a trip to Laughlin a couple months back staying at Harrahs no problems.  So I asked to speak with her manager so sue called him and then hung up and said to hold on, she went out a door and was behind us talking to a man on a desk who followed her to her workstation and said he was the guy in charge, his name was Justin Prince.  We explained to him the problem of charging the card vs auth and the fact that even after we checked out the reverse normally would take a couple of days to process. He really didn't care not even when I told him about the other much nicer hotels and even Caesar's sister hotel Harrah's.   Not very customer service oriented.  

We finally made it to the rooms and they were nice large marble floor bathrooms with jetted tub, comfy bed and nice linens, flat screen TV and a decent view of the Bellagio.  After unpacking and getting situated we realized the lack of outlets in the room.  With 3 people staying in the room in a gadget dominated world with only 3 open plugs, certainly not enough for the iPhones and iPads and laptop to all charge at the same time.   I did call the front desk and they sent a maintenance man over with a power cord and I do have to say the lady at the desk and the maintenance man were quite nice.  My only other issue was they only provided 2 sets of towels, so I had to call down for that too. 

Now the Casino- well it's the same OLD, same OLD.  Not much different than when walking thru in visits past.   They need a make over or major refurbishment. 

The Forum Shops-  Very nice shopping as usual.  Probably the only reason for a future visit.",0,0,0

4 Pool was awesome, with comfortable chairs.
5. Service was good - Cocktail waitresses and pool waitress were attentive.

Cons:
1. Their room pillows were less than comfprtable.
2. Ventilation in the casino (especially the older part) could be improved. Smoke oder was noticeable. But I can't complain that much because I was smoking.
3. Due to the season, the towers blocked the sun at the pool until maybe 4:00. The waitress says this does not happen in the summer.
4. Our wait at check-in and waits in the food court were a little long.

It was much better and bigger then the Forum and Palace rooms. I love staying in the Forum tower because they have everything I need and like, right there in that area as well, Total rewards booth, numb bar, starbucks, pizza and the Forum Casino. I had rented 3 scooters to get around town with everyone, some of course walked, and they all fit in the room. I also had a roll-away bed brought in, that fit too. This room like any other room is very welcoming and big. It's clean, the staff are all very friendly and they always say Hello every time you pass them. Access to the Diamond Lounge, Valet, Starbucks, Front desk area are all right there. The High slot area is the place to play. It has the best games to play then the other properties in my opinion. My son got his first hand pay, $2500 playing the wheel of fortune in high slot area. I was playing right outside the high slot area which I believe is the Palace casino area and while playing the dollar wheel of fortune, I  spun the wheel and got that $1000. It was pretty awesome. Of course, my son won his hand pay on my birthday and I won the day after.He gave his girlfriend and I $200 each. It was a fantastic feeling.I wish my birthday came every month so the Slot Gods would be generous each and every time. But overall, we love all the games they have there and there's always action. The Sports book was crazy as we watched the MLB games. The atmosphere was awesome. Almost like we were at the Stadium, it was live. I would recommend this to everyone. If you can't get a room at the Augustus tower then I say he Forum tower. It has a lot on that side of the property. Don't forget to rent a scooter, you won't be tired and you can fly anywhere in the hotel without any problems. Conventions are plenty with a lot of people so having the scooter makes everything a little bit more fun and not being tired from a lot of walking.

Not sure if it is due to the overwhelming concentrated group of smokers that venture here or if it is the poor filtration system. My eyes were parched and stunned.

This place must have killer acts. The current feature is Celine Dion's ""A New Day."" My friend watched the show and was moved. I met her in the Celine Dion store after the concert, and the place was mobbed! It was unlike the Cirque du Soleil 'O' store in the Bellagio. If you just stood still in the store, you still got trumped over. Celine Dion is about to say bye-bye to Vegas. Her contract was only suppose to be through 2003, and it was extended through 2007.

I feel like we overpayed for the rooms since we were there for a massive convention.  We stayed in the Roman Tower and the rooms were standard.  The bathroom was the standout since it was all marble with a huge soaking tub (I never used it, though).

The food choices were great (cheap (food court, augustus cafe) and expensive (palm, joe's stone crab, nero's) and the traffic was cool (simon cowell was playing blackjack at the table across from me).

The big perk was the Pussycat Dolls gambling area.  It's cheesy as hell, but they dance and deal while PCD music plays.  It is so much easier giving your money away to a good looking dealer.  Also, it's fun seeing all the people waiting to get into PURE.",1,1,0

Since I'm not much of a gambling man, this review focuses on the hotel aspect and primarily the room.

First, the hotel, like many have said, is too large and the conference center is buried in the back of the compound, with some of the longest escalator rides ever.  Casino\/hotel signs and directions are generally lacking and not clear, especially in the conference center.

Second, my room in the Roman tower was outdated and lacking.  Tube TV with 20 channels; a cheap power strip sticking out from underneath the tv stand with a plethora of items plugged in.  A Motorola cable modem blinking away down there too.  Lacking some standard amenities (coffee pot, mini bar\/fridge, ample power plugs on desk or near bed).  The only redeeming factor was that the bathroom was huge.

Third, in-room wireless internet is an ungodly $14.99 per night PER device.  Other ""standard"" business hotels (Hilton, Marriott, Westin) charge for internet, but all your devices can use it.  And to top it off, the wireless service was extremely slow.

In summary, if it weren't for the business trip and conference at Caesar's, I would not have come here - and I definitely won't return.",7,0,0

I expected ""Caesars"" to be a top notch hotel with a modern feel and excellent service not a ""run down"" ""your on your own"" approach. Im not sure where to start but here it goes. First off I needed a frig for some medication. They wanted to charge me $20 but after talking to them they waived the fee and made me feel like they were doing me a favor by giving me a frig that other hotels provide as a standard for their rooms. The frig came 3 hours later and I had to call guest services to remind them. Good thing I had ice and a small ice chest on standby. When the frig came it looked like it had gone through a war and functioned poorly. Second the room was very outdated. The bedding was poor, a few of the lamps and electrical outlets were not functional and the furniture was mismatched\/faded. Third was the view. I know I didn't pay for a room with a strip view but could I maybe get a view of the freeway instead of looking out the window at a concrete wall with a ladder. I think a jail cell would have a better view of the outside world then the one ""Caesars"" had. Fourth they said at the front desk that I would be charged $25 for the resort fee but at checkout they charged me $28 per day for the resort fee. With the price that ""Caesars"" charges for their rooms you get the room quality of a motel and not a Las Vegas Resort. Bottom line is I was so disgusted and angry about the hotel quality, money I paid to be there and the service that it ruined my trip. I was so mad that I didn't even gamble one cent in their casino and will never set foot at ""Caesars"" again. If you are contemplating staying in that area of the strip just stay at ""Treasure Island"". TI has modern rooms, good service, outstanding amenities, and all at a price point that Caesars cant even dream to accomplish. DONT BOOK OR STEP FOOT INSIDE this sorry excuse for a Las Vegas Resort.

Pretty simple. We contact the property. Explained we were having an event and we would have to park 3 cars inside a room that will be awarded to our top performers. Dinner, a stage, cocktails etc. pretty simple event. Nothing out of the ordinary other then maybe the cars. 
So we were contacted and given a contract. On the contract we had s food and beverage minimum that we would surely blow right through. In addition a charge for using the room of 7000. My assistant contact Ceasars and said we throw party's every year. We have used many of the resorts to do so and we have never ever paid a fee to use the room. Response was this is how we do things. My assist brought it to my attention and of course I said no. I won't pay a fee to use the room and inflated food and beverage costs plus AV. 
Ceasars came back with another option after getting a couple more people involved, and quoted us a minimum of 12500 or 1500 for the room and a minimum of 9000.  Can't make this up. Doesn't even ad up. I think at this point they were just stroking us. So we went back and said ok to the 9000 plus 1500 for the room. She described the 1500 as labor for the employees to set it up. So I told my assistant to make sure they give us a quote on the AV and stage. This is where I simply dropped my jaw and thought what bs. 
The lady first said to my assistant you have to sign the agreement by tomorrow or the prices and guarantees are gone. So I was already out of my office at the time on Tuesday and we assumed we would call in the morning and work out the details. My assistant called in the morning, late morning and early afternoon. Finally she gets a call back at 5:30. The lady at Ceasars said you need to sign this agreement right away or we will not guarantee the price. We said well what's the price on AV and stage etc. she replied and I quote, ""you need to sign the contract for us to give you those numbers"". Now, I was born at night just not last night. This was a joke. And she was serious. 
 I'm in the car business. A heavily criticized business. But this is just a fools agreement. There is no way you can trust these idiots. They will not honor nor will they keep your best interests financially at heart. 
So I booked the event at the HardRock hotel with no brain damage. No room fee and they were happy to quote A to Z costs.

I had a conference this past weekend at Ceasar's and had a room in the Roman Tower.  I am aware that Ceasar's had recently built a new tower, but in my opinion, they should have spent the capital upgrading the original towers.  The room was nice enough, but I have been in Comfort Suites that were nicer.  There was mold in the shower and hair on shower walls and ceiling.

The first night, I froze in my room.  The second night, I turned up the thermostat to find that the vent was only blowing cold air.  I placed a call to Front Desk and a serviceman called upon my room 90 minutes later (around midnight, when I had a 7:30am meeting the next day for my conference.)

CHECK IN:  We arrived around 12pm and as we were in line, there was a ""check in nazi"" walking up and down the line telling everyone that check in doesn't start until 1pm.  Okay...  We of course ignored here and proceeded to the next available front desk staff.  Jason was sweet and checked us in, also offering us an upgrade option to one of the newer towers.  if given the opportunity... STAY IN ONE OF THE NEW TOWERS!!   Jason pleasantly checked us in and sent us on our merry way. 

ROOM:  The room in the new tower is BEAUTIFUL.  The beds had pillow tops.  It was spacious and CLEAN.  My biggest complaint is that the vents\/walls\/etc are THIN.  We can hear our neighbors opening\/closing the cabinet drawers, running the water in the bathroom, flushing the toilet, and parts of conversations through the vents.  

HOUSEKEEPING:  The rooms were well cleaned and maintained.  My only gripe is that one of our robes were damaged and we called for a replacement.  I checked out 2 days ago, i'm still waiting on someone to come in and give me a replacement. 

GROUNDS:  I went out to catch a cab. One of the groundsmen were dusting the marble steps.  He was off to one side of the step and i slowly was going to shimmy through the other side.  He practically had an anurism and did not let me pass.  He shoooed me away to go a different route.... really???

They have a few different hotels within Caesars. Each one having it's own style and room design \/ layouts. In the immediate area around the hotel you have some pretty cool sights and restaurants. I'd recommend Mon Ami Gabi across the street for breakfast.

They also have a few pools that are worth checking out.

A magic happened and in 3 seconds he had the numbers, which were additional $800 (!!!) for our 6 nights stay, for a room that doesn't sound better.
Then, we went up to the room and were surprised to see that:
- the carpet was dirty (dried cranberries), and very OLD,
- the faucets were full of corrosion,
- one faucet was not working,
- you have to flush the toilet twice because the first time does nothing,
- very low light in the bathroom,
- overall, the entire room was very old, felt like going back in time to the 90's.
We called front desk and they sent someone to fix the broken faucet, but that's about it. So we asked for a room transfer, and we asked to see the room first, they took us to see a room that was SMALLER (!!!) than our room, which was a waste of over 1 hour of wait time. We specifically paid for the slightly larger room because we were 4 in the room (3 adults). Then, they showed us a room which was the same size but had roughly the same issues as in our rooms, probably because the room was in the same tower (palace). We had to go all the way to the reception to get the key to the other room because they didn't want to send someone to give us the key (!!!). Even worse, initially they said we cannot see the room, we have to move without seeing it. Obviously I insisted on seeing it first.
Then, we realized we will be billed for resort fee, which is common on the strip (as they said), even though our package said we fully paid for everything. We thought we don't have wifi so when they said the resort fee includes wifi we were at least happy about that. BUT, we only had one bar when we used the wifi!!! just in case it's not clear -- wifi with 1 bar feels like dial up, which completed our experience of a hotel in the 90's :(
So, we asked to talk to a manager after they suggested to take down the resort fee for a couple of days, which is a joke. The manager called us only at the next day at 10pm! and only to the room, even though we asked them to call our cell. And then we gave them our cell phone number again and they did the same thing after 2 more nights! so we only got to talk to a manger just before our last night there, after spending hours on the phone with probably almost 10 different representatives, explaining our issues over and over again.
Eventually the 2nd manager removed the resort fee completely, but it was not enough, I will never go back there.
Just to be clear, if we had paid $60 a night as in the Excalibur then we would accept the poor maintenance of the room and also the service, but we paid much more for Caesars (hard to say exactly because it was a package with the flights) and we did not expect to feel like we're in the 90's.
Other than the room, the casino stinks from smoking, slightly more than the average on the strip, and extremely more than new hotels such as Aria and Cosmopolitan.
The only reason we gave Caesars 'poor' instead of 'terrible' is the location, and also some restaurants were ok.",0,0,0

We arrived around 1pm and were given the option to pay $25 to check in immediately or wait until 3 for the room to be cleaned. We waited.

We checked in at 3 to find our room hadn't been cleaned and the bell hop had us carry our bags from the service elevator. In the room, we found assorted trash (medicine and old key cards) and food left under the furniture. The front desk offered us a $50 drink comp and promised to clean the room. We gladly took it and headed to the pool.

At the pool, we found toilet paper and other assorted trash in the water by the blackjack tables. Be extremely careful entering the pool a member of our party slipped on the stairs and about 30 minutes later another  hotel patron slipped no the same stairs. Luckily, neither was severely hurt.  

After 1.5 hours we returned to the room to find the assorted trash removed (we had piled it next to the tv stand) but the old food remained. We again asked the front desk to help. First, they asked if it was our food (we'd spent less then 30 minutes in the room at this point) and then asked for the exact location so house keeping could remove it in the next 10 to 15 minutes. They also offered to comp all our drinks at the pool. Over the next 1.5 hours while we prepped for dinner, house keeping never arrived.

While prepping for dinner we found that using one sink would cause the other sink to fill with dirty water. Again they assured us that maintenance would be right up (10 to 15 minutes) to correct the problem. Maintenance hadn't showed when we left for dinner an hour later. 

When we returned they told us we were changing rooms. The old food was still in the room and the sinks were still clogging. Again, we were told the bell hop would be right up. The bell hop never came. While we were waiting, another group had been given keys to our room and our keys were deactivated. 

1.5 hours after we were told the bell hop would be ""right up"" the room change actually occurred. The room change occurred at 1230 am after a visit to the front desk when we needed to be up at 7 am for flights. 


For the trouble, we were promised that all our drinks would be comped, a $50 food voucher (for breakfast), an upgraded room, and $50 off our original rate.

Supervisor Jonathan Grant was extremely helpful in finally remedying the situation. If the story ended here, this would likely be a 3 star review. However, our problems continued the following morning.

When we tried to use the $50 voucher for breakfast we were told we couldn't charge anything to the room as Caesar's had listed the room as cash only, even though there is a $200 hold on my card. We ended up paying for breakfast ourselves and headed back to the front desk to fix the situation. 

At the front desk we were promptly told by Supervisor MacKinzie Sherlock that Caesar's would not be honoring the comps we had been promised and would only remove the drink charges and $35 of our breakfast. Having spent roughly 1\/3 of our stay speaking with the front desk and needing to leave for the airport we simply checked out.

All in all my Caesar's experience was way below my expectations. If you're looking to stay on the strip near Caesar's, just stay at the Bellagio where I've stayed multiple times with no issues. Chances are I'll never go back to Caesar's and have already changed hotels for a large bachelor party in September.",17,2,1

I stayed here for business for a week and my entire week was pleasant. The convention staff was helpful including the business center. 

Gordon Ramsay restaurant is awesome. Rather cheap - about $ 100 or so for two people. The Central by Michel Richard will cost you about $ 30 for an oily meal - good after 12 bottles of beer. My blood was filled with alcohol and needed comfort food - they sat me right away! Think of it as Food 911 or Post-alcohol 911. 

The room? Decent. I've been to better hotels like Mandalay Bay.

- Electronic curtain because walking four steps is way too difficult
- Big desk so I was able to spread out my clothes and 3 laptops (that's why they hate me at security)
- Bathroom has nice amenities just like most hotels on the Strip
- LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - keep your wallet handy, you'll spend money in drinks, food and shopping. Guaranteed.

Cons: The decor was plain and outdated, the TVs were old and crappy and there was no view.  There were Krurig coffee makers in the rooms but you had to pay $12 to get 3 K-cups at the honor bar (getting nickle and dimed while paying $1000 a night to stay here = not cool and not classy!).

Secondly, they only let two people in each room have free Wi-Fi for the day. For reference, we were staying in a 4 person suite. And the Wi-FI was slooooooooooow. We were barely able to go online at all. Thirdly, they charge you what they call a resort fee per day, which is for using the pool and the fitness center ( which again, only two people could use a day. Although everyone can use the pool) It doesn't seem like you can opt out either, so why not just include it in the price?

Other than that, I really enjoyed my stay here. The Pool of the Gods is so relaxing early morning before the crowds arrive. You're right across from the High Roller at the Linq and next to the Bellagio Fountains. Bacchanal Buffet is right inside the hotel. Forum Shops are right there, need I say more?",7,1,3

The bathroom was spacious and included a television installed in the mirror which was awesome. The bad part about it was that our room's view was of a wall. The Augustus tower rooms were HUGE, like twice as large as those in the forum tower. More space than necessary but it was nice. Great view too, of the Bellagio fountains. I preferred the forum tower bathrooms more but the Augustus tower bathrooms weren't too shabby. We were lucky enough to get one of the few rooms around the elevator area which are roughly ten feet longer than the rest of the already large rooms in the tower.

While leaving the hotel on our way to LA, we came across an extremely buzzed man walking unstably in traffic next to the hotel by the parking lot. All of a sudden he stopped walking and we waited for him to move for maybe a full minute? He was not budging so we finally honked at him.

The meat in this salad is Salami, I asked that they substitute that processed junk for chicken.  The $16 salad was as unimaginative as you can get.

The many reviews suggested that it was like old vegas and honestly I would agree.  It just had a different feel overall... still a gambling resort\/hotel, but almost everything was in good upkeep and the people seemed to have a little more... class.  I'm not 100% sure I can describe it, but it seemed they were still paying attention to a lot of those little details.

For example, we went one day to their little mini food court to grab a slice of pizza... long story short the CHEF of the little pizza place and I had a long discussion\/teaching lesson about the proper way to not create heat and acid in pizza sauce.  Along with how their 60 degree oven temp difference and humidity difference caused them to use 4 different flours versus up in front of the hotel which only used two and the overall gluten content difference in oz's.  It was so incredibly detailed for just the random pizza food court chef.  Honestly, there was multiple honest to god chef's in the food court, that just floored me in general.  

The check in was nice and we got Jasper to check us in who was FANTASTIC.  She was super friendly and knowledgeable.  We mentioned it was my wife's birthday weekend and she offered a different tower, but a much larger room, which was fantastic.  Supposedly they were doing construction nearby, but we never heard it.  Marble bathroom, comfy bed, great pools.  We really enjoyed it overall... ended up at Cleopatras barge which I had heard about from my mother from 30 years previous.  We almost might say we liked cleos barge as much as we liked some of the mega clubs as it was super lowkey and fun, but honestly, we're talking a fun chill bar with a mini dance floor vs a mega club...not in the same ballpark.  Still relaxing and fun.

I've always wanted to stay at Caesar's, but for whatever reason, haven't until now......and probably never will again. 

They are lucky they are in the middle of the strip, because that is really the only reason they get the 2 Stars. Upon check in, they are trying to get you to spend money. The woman checking me in says, do you want to upgrade for $40\/night? So I say, what do I get with an upgrade.....and she says, ""uhhh, maybe a bigger room and a flat screen""? No thanks....I'll pass.

The hotel is old and out dated. The positives of Caesar's are everything BUT the actual rooms. The casino\/sports book is decent. I hate the renovations that have done at the Sports Book. They basically cut the size in half with the new bar they put in.....oh well, they take your money the same as before. Location is center strip, convenient to a lot of attractions. The rooms are garbage. We had a single King in the Roman tower. Your basic run of the mill room that you can get anywhere else on the strip. The hotel is freezing cold.....the room doesn't provide you the option of water bottles like every other place on earth does. My wife and I have been married 11 years.....but NO bathroom door.....that's a little interesting. The tub was brown, and the shower had mold on the ceiling.

Kaoki is the front desk manager and is not qualified or friendly or professional iin dealing with guests. He has no business being in the industry as is one of the rudest service person. I challenge the hotel to look at video and audio of my horrible experience. 
Also, if you gamble at sports book you cannot place bet until after 9am because they open late. Posted hours on sites say 8am. If you are here for a conference, you are in meetings by 9am so you miss out on betting.

I wanted to stay somewhere nice as it was only for a few days and figured that it would be worth it to splurge on an iconic location. Boy was I wrong! After checking into our room, which smelled like cigarette smoke and looked like a seedy motel of route 66, I went to check out the strip with my sister. When we came back our bathroom had completely flooded. And not just with water. It was covered in this black muck and it was clear that housekeeping had tried to clean it up but then gave up and settled for throwing a towel over it (the logic in this move is just crazy). It was also over all of my makeup and brushes. Obviously it was a bathroom so the water wasn't the cleanest. We called the front desk and explained the situation, they did give us a room upgrade right off the bat which I appreciated. We had to insist that they send someone up test the water to make sure it wasn't contaminated. 

I was expecting a few other comps as well considering how gross\/traumatic it is to have your expensive cosmetics covered in dirty water but they were pretty stingy. They replaced my brushes for me but since my makeup containers were ""closed"" they washed them for me and gave them back to me.

I think that it has the best location on the strip. It's located right in the middle of the strip, so it's easy to walk to both ends from the hotel. It's also located across the street from one of the newer parts of the strip; an outdoor ""mall"" that has new restaurants and shops along with a giant ferris wheel!

Inside Caesar's Palace they have a shopping center with every upscale store that you can imagine. The shopping center is beautiful with a ceiling painted like the sky with clouds and it's really pretty. Also inside the shopping center is a ""Fall of Atlantis"" animatronic show which I have to watch every time I am in Las Vegas. It's really entertaining with fire, lights, water and everything!

There are also plenty of great restaurants inside Caesar's Palace so you don't have to go to another hotel to get something to eat. My Husband and I's favorite is Joe's which has great snow crab and seafood. I had to make a reservation two weeks in advance for a 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday in March!

I had stayed here several years ago for a conference and was back in town this week for another trade show.  Instead of being at the Venetian or the Wynn, I was one of the few unlucky ones who got stuck at Caesar's.  

Let's just do a quick rundown of what was crummy about my stay there:
- Official check-in is at 4 PM but my room wasn't ready until 5:30 PM.
- Room was in the Roman Towers which smells musty.  
- TV was broken, 2 lights were out, 1 flickered, and there was no TV remote.  Not offered a room switch although I should have insisted on one. 
- Paul Mitchell convention with tons of young hairdressers who unfortunately were in the room next to me and got back drunk every night at 3-4 AM yelling & screaming.  Rooms don't have much sound insulation so I heard much of their conversation.  It also took the Front Desk over 15 minutes to send someone up 2 times to get to finally shut up.  I wasn't offered another room either or a comp.  
- $25\/day to use the gym which had the cheap eclipital machines, no rowing machines and a single bench press.  YMCA typically have more impressive gyms and equipment especially in regards to free weights.   
- There is no express check-out.  It took over 30 minutes just to hand in my key & get my room receipt.    

It is clear as day that Caesar's has been really hit by the economic downturn & really been skimping as much as possible on room maintenance.  Also not a place that is business traveler friendly as evidenced by the disaster that is the check-in\/check-out process.  It never was a great place for service but you frankly get better service from the Front Desk at a Motel 6.  

The only good thing about the stay was that the bed was comfortable & the bathroom had a shower & tub.  I would have just been better off staying at the Hard Rock or another place off the Strip instead.",1,1,0

We ended up getting to the hotel to check in around 430pm and we only waited around 10-15min. The front desk person tried to up sell us a different room and we declined because my dad purchased this room for us and we didn't want to pay extra money. We stayed in the Roman Tower and when we got to the room, we had mirrors on the ceiling and a hot tub in the bedroom. Oh and you can see in the bathroom from the bedroom, because one of the walls is glass (nice touch) Our view from the room was of the pool that had constuction but we could see the sunset and a good view of the Palms (which is where we will stay next time) and the Rio. When we got to the room it was clean and we had no issues. 
I lived in Vegas for almost 2 years and I still got lost in this hotel. I started to figure it out only one day in but still. This place is huge. The only things we played at Caesar's was penny\/nickel slots. We went across the street to O'Shea's to play table games since it was cheaper. We didn't eat anywhere in this hotel so I cant say anything about that but over all it was a nice room and the people working their were kind. 
Don't even think about checking out at the front desk on a fri-sun, for its WAY to busy.

I have been a customer since 1975 the place has gone right down hill. I tried to check in yesterday when the hotel was 60% of capacity. It was 2:00 The front desk clerk said come back at 4:00 or pay $30.00. I said I am playing a tournament at ceasars and won't be done till 2:00 am and it would be greatly appreciated if I could check in now  he got his manager Roland Deguilmo who came out and was extremely rude and seemed to be doing whatever he could to be disrespectful and cause a terrible customer experience. So I came back at 2:00 am and 15 people were waiting to check in I did not get my room till past 3:00am. They only had 1 person working. The room did not even have a clock in it and the lighting was so dim I could hardly see. The rooms are 15 years past updating. Ate breakfast their also. Paid $22.00 for an omelette that was a 4 at best on a 1-10 scale. Toast was cold and they make u butter it yourself even though you ask them to butter it before they bring it to you.  Overall a miserable experience. They have lost me as a customer. I will never go back. It's no wonder they are in BK. They simply don't care,3,0,0

We were never warned about that and had some charges that we didnt do. They did prorate it for us but they should have a lock on the mini fridge. You can also request a fridge for your own food our drinks by calling house keeping.  We also order room service for breakfast Saturday morning and it was not that great.

I was upgraded to a deluxe room in the Augustus Tower with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  

I'm a bit biased.

Let me just tell you, though, if you can get this room... you should.  I didn't want to check out.  The room was huge, the beds were comfortable, the view was breathtaking, the bathroom was god-like and I just fell in love with it all.  Now I'm withholding a star from this rating because the other two people I came with, who were also upgraded to this tower, did not get the same view and their room just wasn't the same without it.  Still nice, just not 5-star worthy.  

Some things to know...

1.  The taxi cab line is crazy.  It's really not worth waiting if you are going somewhere within walking distance.  I waited over 45 minutes one night.  

2.  The pool at Caesars is top notch.  Don't make the mistake of finding this out on the last day (like I did).  Experience it, love it and oh yeah, get there early cause it fills up quickly!

3.  The 24-hour buffet pass is worth it.  I know it seems steep, but just purchase it and you won't regret it.  Ceasars for breakfast (seriously, it's the best for that) and Planet Hollywood for dinner.  Rinse and repeat.  I left out lunch because you should be a) at the pool b) at the spa or c) raking in money at the craps table.  

Overall, I can definitely recommend Ceasars Palace, but just make sure you don't get stuck in one of the old rooms.  Whatever you can do to get into the Augustus Tower, do it.  And request a view of the Bellagio Fountains!",0,0,0

Rooms are old and smelly, ice bucket didn't have the plastic liners and I know we didn't get a suite as booked cause there was no bath ropes or slip-on in the rooms and when I called guest services asking for it I was told ropes\/slip-on are only for suites and my room is not a suite. 

I've asked multiple times for a copy of my recorded reservation recording conversation but I still have not receive it.

We originally booked at the Mirage for the same price since we wanted to see the Beatles Love show but there's less casino crowds at Caeser's so it seemed like a good buy. 

The week of the trip we received an email stating we might be able to upgrade the room for $37 for a deluxe King Octavius Suite or Augusta Tower so we gladly submitted our request for an upgrade if available. I wasn't surprised that neither upgrade was available but I was a little insulted that a King Bed Octavius Tower room was offered to us at $74 a night extra. It's like a bait and switch tactic telling me you can get less and pay more for the upgrade. We took the upgrade even with that because the Octavius tower is closer to the Garden of the Gods pool and it's supposed to be nicer then the forum. 

I made the mistake of using a debit card to secure the 1st night so that I could collect reward points from my bank but this ended up being a mistake because the both the credit card (security deposit) a bank card were authorized for the same amount. I wasn't worried about being double billed but when you're in Vegas, you wanted a much money on hand to gamble and eat with. So lesson learned, don't give them a debit card since they take a larger room deposit and in my case, they authorized both cards on file. 

The person who checked us in at the front entrance was VERY pleasant (Leza) and I felt like she was very welcoming. Not saying some of the other front desk people we worked with throughout the week were bad but she's wasn't as stiff as they were :)

Because of the upgrade, we were able to check in around 9:30am. We ate at the Bacchanal buffet as part of the Buffet of Buffets pass. (Separate review of both the buffet and the pass). Headed to the pool only to find that the Augustus Tower blocks most of the sun from the pool until late afternoon. The pool is amazingly beautiful, well-kept but the lack of spots with sun could be a reason for us not to book here during the warmer months. On day two, the entire pool for the day was closed because they were filming a movie there. Not cool ... especially with no advance until the day of. We end getting into the Bellagio pool for a small price and spent our money at their pool which is much nicer since they get more sun. This is my only real negative comment about Caesars.

Octavius Tower: We had a standard size King Room facing a view of the back of the Bellagio. We could see the water fountain show from a far which was cool. The room was spacious with nice furniture but a little on the basic side. I thought there would be a Caesar's flare to the room but that was limited to the one painting on the wall. It seems that at all hours of the afternoon and early evening, there were maid stations parked in the hallways so if two people were moving in opposite directions down the hallway, one person had to let the other through. This happened at least 6-7 times and this isn't something I should have to deal with from a 5 star hotel. Maybe they were understaffed that weekend but still. The bathrooms were nice and did have that flare to them. Overall, I really wouldn't pay more for the Octavius King Bed tower if offered the upgrade. 
Resort Fees: Ugh. You can't get around these unless you trade in Reward Points and the services that you could use with the resort fees are pretty limited. I don't want a $25 credit towards an overpriced spa and I shouldn't have to pay for use of the gym or internet. Caesar would be better off charging you $25 as a resort fee and giving you a $25 poker chip. That way I'd feel like I got something out of it when you lthe $25 anyways. BTW. We could not use our mobile phones in the Octavius Tower room so if you're banking on using that as a tethering device, you can't unless you want to move the desk by the window for spotty service. This could also be a problem if you're trying to connect with other ppl.  

Would I stay a Caesars again? Yes but only if I got a deal.  I felt like we overpaid for what we received but I liked being in a casino where I didn't to elbow yourself a spot in a crowd.",0,0,0

Here's why:

Check in and out were a breeze with the self services stations. Navigating from the parking garage (free - yes, one perk) with our many overloaded bags to the room was like competing a Spartan Race... Our room was great - clean, spacious, and luxurious - up until we tried to use the Jacuzzi tub and it spewed tons of unidentified black stands into the water...

We brought this to the attention of the hotel and they sent engineering and housekeeping up.  When we returned to the room there was a note from engineering saying the job was complete. Housekeeping cleaned up the black things. 

Fast forward to our last night in Vegas when we planned our night around relaxing in the Jacuzzi tub.... Deja vu.  Seeing as it was close to midnight, we called the hotel desk and filed another complaint. The boyfriend told them we were giving up on using the tub but were disappointed since the problem was supposed to be fixed. He made it clear that since it was so late we did not want it to be fixed.  

Just as we were falling asleep (almost 2am) the phone rang. We didn't pick it up. Seconds later our door opened and someone came in (we assume to fix the tub).  We asked them to leave since we were sleeping. The boyfriend couldn't sleep after that and spoke with the front desk about the rude awakening. 

The worst wake up though happened at 3:30am on our second night when a concerning alarm stating that there was an unidentified emergency and that we should stay calm and in our room was blaring in our ears. The automated loud speaker message said that security would keep us ""apprised of the situation"". After what felt like 10-15 minutes and of the alarm going off and another half hour of being freaked out and thinking worst case scenarios, the alarm stopped. We called the front desk and they said everything was probably fine but to stay in our room until security said otherwise. Lovely way to relax on vacation. 

Needless to say, we never heard from security and had to call to find out that it was a hot shower that set off the smoke alarm. REALLY?? Either we were lied to or they need to fix their smoke alarm so it doesn't alert the whole hotel of some unknown emergency. 

For all of our inconveniences we did get some monetary resolution. While I respect that the hotel tried to better a not- so-great stay, money doesn't fix the fact that we spent a lot on what we thought would be a fun and relaxing getaway. Not so relaxing when you can't use the amenities you paid for or get more than one night of uninterrupted sleep....",21,4,2

I didn't look for this place and I'm not making the name up, but I was a little upset at the name, not to say I didn't try it, but still!

The prices here in this food court of non commercial eateries is fairly expensive, but somewhat satisfying. The menu's are small but the different places remind me of the buffet at the Planet Hollywood (Spice Market).

The bowl of udon cost me 9.95 and it was pretty good. The best part was the soy sauce packets, heck with red and yellow packets, or white with red packets.....these are fish! 

Like they're little fish where you unscrew their mouths and squeeze them and they barf out soy sauce, I mean if I was full of soy I'd barf too...

But if you're in the area, across from Bette Midler, and hungry for some sterotypes and people watching, enjoy a bite at the food court of the Caesars... don't forget to get your cigar at Casa Fuente afterwards!",1,2,1

Flash forward to when we actually were staying there.  We got in super early, so we did was was called a 'pre-checkin'  which was awesome.  Basically it was taking care of all the paperwork without actually checking in.  Lisa was very helpful and very nice and basically one of the highlights of our precheck-in.  Once we successfully killed a few hours, we were still early but we wanted to check in.  When we approached the desk to get our keys, the woman working did not want to help us at all. Instead of being customer friendly, she almost refused us because we had 'refused to pay the early checkin' (which is not true..  Lisa did not pressure us at all and we were told we could come back we could check in at any time, and if it was early we had to pay a fee.).  I advsied Zandra that I never refused the fee and she proceeded to check us in with no additional conversation.  With Zandra, I was immediately disappointed.  Not a good start to the vacation. 

When we got up to the room, it was beautiful!  It was comfy and cozy and very well decorated (and there was a tub.. score!).  One complaint, there was no signage or anything that the snacks on top of the minifridge were on magnets that once you had it off for 30 seconds, it charged you (we found that one out when the wonderful bell man - i believe his name was Amir- told us when he brought up our bags). 

When we checked in, we got a coupon book for some deals within the hotel.  With each coupon, we ran into some stipulation that was never stated on the actual coupon (one was at Serendipity 3 and the other at the gift shop). 

Caesars is a nice place to stay, but watch out for cranky front desk agents and coupon books that have fine print not even written anywhere you can see.  Most likely, we will not be returning to stay again.",0,0,0

I made reservations Oct 10, and they took a deposit down, so I thought my hotel room was secured for Nov 17.  I made the transaction on the total rewards site and not a third party discounted site like Kayak, Priceline, etc.  

The problem:

I went with 2 other friends and we checked-in around 11:00 PM on Friday and when we checked in the hostess mentioned that they gave up our room with two queen beds.  My friends and I were shocked.  The reason was because even though you booked your room, mind you we even paid the deposit a while back of around $210, we didn't call in to fully reserve the room.  Apparently there's fine print regarding this.  Additionally, because I had a third person and initially only had two down, was also another reason to switch the rooms and put us all in ONE KING SIZE BED.  What in the worldl!?  

What hotel would allow you to not have your room when you put a two hundred dollar deposit down.  It's business at the end of the day and they're looking to switch rooms around at 11:00 pm so they can accomodate others because there's a chance people like us come in late, OR don't show up so they anticipate that.  Regardless of coming in late, we should still have our room!  It's analogous to flights being overbooked BUT at least you get often times a voucher OR you actually get on your flight.  In our case, we had to bring a roll away cot, which made our room tinier.   So guess who ended up getting screwed on the cot - this guy.

I go to Vegas often.  This was my 3rd time in the fall because I bet college football.  I'm not a high-roller, hence, the lack of treatment.   But this was really unacceptable!  I'm still super frustrated at the lack of hospitality regarding our situation.  At the end, our friends got screwed and we were all pretty upset about it during the trip.  

Luckily my friend works at Afar Travel Magazine and will likely tell the writers his situation so write about it.  Truely unacceptable, especially when we paid a deposit for $210 a month before the reservation.",2,0,0

Sure, the location makes it nice, but still can be redonkulous pricing.  But still, it's a great place to stay at if the price is right.

Now if you do stay here, I recommend the Augustus Tower, which is located next to check-in.  Otherwise you're gonna have to hike your shit through the casino maze all the way on the other side of the hotel to your elevators.  Augustus rooms are kinda like mini-suites, not nearly as big as Palazzo but I think run the same price or even more...so again not worth it unless you're getting a deal or bribing the checkin to upgrade.  Good views of the fountains from here.

Forum shops, Pure, and the pool are cool things to do.  Serendipity out front for you to indulge your choco desires.

There seem to be alot of hookers that hang out here in front when you're walking back late at night...so if you're looking for some hoodrats or ""just a mouth"" to entertain you, stroll on through.

Pai Gow: I've had some good runs here (once got 4 straight flushes in about an hour)  but unless you can hang with the typical $50 mins, this ain't the place to play.  I'd only come here when starting out or if I'm up already.  Cool dealers too.  Crystal is funny as hell.",0,1,0

We got wonderful seats in the Coliseum for the Celine Dion concert with not a bad seat in the house. Plus it was nice that it's a no smoking auditorium. I wasn't what you would call a big Celine fan before I saw her in concert here, but I was very impressed and was entertained by her singing and vocal abilities. It actually gave me chills!

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed.  The main valet is ALWAYS full.  This results in needing to use the alternate in the back, which is a pain.  Check in was a pain, it took an insane amount of time to even get to the desk.  Once there it wasn't any faster.  Although I do need to admit that the attendant was very friendly, and gave us some great restaurant recommendations.

Once we got to the room it was pretty much what you would expect.  It was clean, bright, and pretty luxurious.  Yet, that soon gets overlooked when you start noticing how they nickel and dime you for everything.  For example, they charge you to use the provided styrofoam cups.  They charge you if you reorder the dry good item (not consume, MOVE).  If you open the fridge and shift a bottle to put in your water, there's a charge for that too.  It got to the point where I was scared if I called the operator I would be charged for that too.",1,0,0

I shared a room with another girl in our bachelorette group; between the two of us, we paid $544 for three nights. That's about $181\/night. However, when she arrived to check us in, they informed her that they only allow groups of three or more to have rooms with two beds. Apparently, the room we'd booked included one FULL-sized bed. Now, that's not the end of the world, but really, who pays $181\/night to share a full bed?! She was able to pay $20 for an upgrade and from then on, everything was awesome.

We ended up in the Octavius tower, which is the newer one. Our room was HUGE. Two amazing beds, huge bathroom, tons of space. Everything seemed clean and in good condition which is always a plus. The blinds on the (giant) windows were amazing as well - I would up at 8:30am and thought it was the middle of the night because it was SO dark. Well done, blinds.

I loved the pool, as well. We had a ton of pools to choose from and that whole area seemed pretty clean, too. The first day we tried for the pool we could only get a few chairs because it was so packed, but the next day was quite a bit easier since we went early. 

I really have no complaints other than the ""two beds for 3+ people"" thing, because that's pretty annoying. Nothing a crisp $20 bill won't fix, though.",2,0,0

We had a nice high room with a view of the Bellagio fountain.  That view was such a pleasure at night and even during the day when we were resting between excursions.  Room was clean and spacious with comfortable beds, a sitting area near the window, and a small dining table that came in handy since we brought food back to the room a few times.  Bathroom was big, with jetted tub, walk-in shower, and fortunately the toilet had its own separate room.  For being a newer addition to the hotel, I will say that you do notice some slight wear and tear (like a small rip in the wallpaper on window sill and ceiling), but considering possible party crowds in rooms over the years, it's held up very well and still has a luxe feeling to it.

Loved the location of the Augustus Tower.  Never had to walk through the casino to get to the Strip, pool, front desk, or buffet.  This was a huge plus since we had our young school age kids along on this trip.  Also, Starbucks was near the ground floor elevator, so convenient for a coffee fix on the way out each morning.

Regarding hotel being family friendly, we had no issues at all taking our kids around.  We never felt unwelcome anywhere on the property, even at the pool.

Front desk staff was nice and professional.  (Common knowledge, folks, that if you treat people well, they tend to treat you well.  It pays to be friendly, especially to those handling your room arrangements.)  The staff kept the line going and did a good job combating people who had a tendency to ""casually cut"" in front of others, making them return to their original place in line.

I've been staying here every year for about 8 years (meet here yearly for a Trauma Conference) so it with some regret I'm only giving this visit\/stay a 3 star review.  The little mix up to my reservation was that I had requested a King bed and was given a two queen room, in addition they had placed me in a free upgrade without asking (in a brand new tower) and when i saw that and requested my original room back they found that my requested room type no longer existed. 

To explain more fully I will say that the conference meets early and runs late, and we found early on that to stay in the tower that the conference rooms are actually in (20 floors down of course!) is much more convenient and there is no lack of luxury in the wonderful jacuzzi suites. Because of this when i make my reservations FOUR months in advance I sort of expect a place as wonderful as Caesar's to be able to keep the original reservation or maybe at least mention that all bets are off and i may not get what i wanted in spite of the fact of early reservations or that they might upgrade me without my knowledge. We routinely stay at the Langham Pasadena (formerly Ritz Carlton) and while I'm not a total snob, they are really the template for the ultimate in customer service. Think Nordstroms gone crazy...that's the Langham.  I guess because we only have a couple of fancy trips per year I appreciate the effort that goes into making my stay that much better. It saddened me somewhat to see that Caesar's was not able to meet or exceed the quality of customer service at the Langham.

So here we are, finally in the correct tower but in a double queen room only 12 floors up (I also request the highest possible floor just for the wow factor of the gorgeous strip views!) Is it a nice room? Yes. Is it the room I had been hoping for for the past four months? No.  

We'll survive, though, and trudge on bravely facing the harsh reality of our measly little queen room but still...visions of the King room still bounce around in my head.  Next year I plan to call in the summer to talk to someone in customer service so that I can use their system to try to not have this happen again. 

Room service was delightful and every staff member I've called on the phone so far has really wished us well and asked how our trip in was. They are so friendly, that's for sure.",1,0,0

We checked in on Sunday early, upgraded to the palace tower so they waived the early check in fee.  Room looked clean, changed and we went to the pool.

At the pool: ready to spend some $$ on drinks and food since work didn't start until Monday, took 3 different requests to different people for a menu.  Finally, a server came over and we received great service once we ordered (approx 45 minutes to get a menu and order).  

Went to the room and I wanted to use the bath \/ jacuzzi (paid for the upgrade so yes!).  Had to wash it with a washcloth and shower gel because it wasn't clean (sparing you the details).  

Went to dinner at Nobu - Noriko was our server and was super AWESOME!

Went to the tiny little lounge that has a ship - Cleopatra's lounge. Good DJ, fun!

Went to the room.  Pillows smelled like they were a billion years old and sweaty.  Bed is SUPER uncomfortable.  Slept with no pillow.

Next day, called housekeeping and requested they replace the four pillows. Not just the cases.  Came back to the room at midnight and the pillows smelled. No change.  Called housekeeping and 15 minutes later they brought two - not four pillows like I had requested since I wanted them all replaced.  They had to go get me two more.

Some things are just the way things are in Las Vegas hotels, you know?

OK, that said, here we go! We usually stay at The Mirage in Vegas, but I got a super-good deal for Caesar's Palace this year and thought it would be fun to try another place on The Strip (and hey...who hasn't heard of Caesar's Palace, right?).

To jump right to the good stuff: Our room was fantastic! We were in the Forum Tower, room 6215. The room was really big, with plenty of room for the king-sized bed (with mirrored headboard! Wowza!), a lounge-style sofa, an arm chair, a desk and chest of drawers, and a big flat-screen TV. Not much of a view, but then there's not much to look at from a hotel room in Vegas, so no worries there. The real ""wow,"" though, was the bathroom! It consisted of a large ""dressing room"" area, with a washstand and huge mirror (with a TV built in!), a lighted closet big enough for both our suitcases, a separate toilet room, and a huge walk-in shower with TWO big ""rain-style"" shower heads and a bench to sit on...very posh!

Now for just a few negatives: The room didn't come equipped with a fridge (the mini-bar was crammed full of items for sale, and the room information warned you about moving things in there to store your personal stuff...they are on a motion sensor, and if you move that $6 can of Diet Coke to store your own $0.50 carton of milk, they WILL charge you for that Coke. Refrigerators may be ordered from housekeeping, but be aware...there will almost certainly be a charge for that also). We decided to save the money and use the ice bucket -- Yay! Free ice! -- to store a carton of milk for our breakfast cereal.

The room did have a nice Keurig coffee\/tea maker, but guess what? Yes...there's a charge to use it. (Let's all say it together: It's The Strip, and that's just how it is on The Strip, so..."")

The TV had a good picture. The selection of free channels was adequate, but limited. Plenty of pay channels, though!  (""It's The Strip, and..."").

The resort fee (Added on to your room charge. But it's The Strip...) included internet connection for one device. Just one. We had two. But it's The Strip.... My husband needed to connect to work, so we ate the $14.99 charge for the second connection. On the upside, the wi-fi was fast and reliable! There were plenty of outlets too, which is a big plus for us.

The bed was very comfortable (a wee bit on the firm side for my tastes, but still comfy), and the pillows were wonderful! (we looked for a label on them, in the hopes of being able to buy a few for our home, but the labels had been removed).

The room also came equipped with ironing board, iron, hair dryer, etc. I didn't ask about charges for those, as we didn't need them. They're probably free, but if you need to use them, ask, because, after all, this is The Strip...

The hotel itself is HUGE, and rather convoluted to navigate. Yes, I know, this is The Strip, and all roads lead either to the casino or to the shops (or both), but Caesar's seemed rather more difficult to navigate than The Mirage. That said, the people were absolutely WONDERFUL, and always willing to help with directions. The Forum Shops are worth a visit even if you're not staying here (the ceiling is gorgeous!), but they're pretty convoluted as well...we got lost there for an hour before asking for help after attending a show at another hotel.

The only real negative about Caesar's Palace is the Bacchanal Buffet. It gets a lot of hype, which is why we decided to try it, but frankly, it's overpriced, and simply not worth it. I've written a separate review about it, but to sum things up: 1) it has nothing you can't get at any other buffet on The Strip, 2) it's about twice the price of any other buffet on The Strip (and, unlike the Cravings buffet at The Mirage, does NOT include beer and wine, 3) it is a total wasteland for vegetarians, and 4) neither smelled nor looked clean. If you decide to stay here, I highly recommend either trying one of the other restaurants in the complex or, if you want a buffet, going to The Mirage.

All in all, not a bad experience (except for the food!). It is, after all, The Strip....",1,0,0

Anyways, staying in the actual rooms was great! The rooms were spacious and there are little hot tub baths. Pretty impressive. 

The pools were amazing. They were fun to hang out around and the group we were with rented a cabana and we all had a great time hanging around and having some shade when needed. I loved it! The pool is what made the trip so fun, I didn't stay out too long because the sun seems to zap my energy, but for the two days that I spent out there I was not disappointed. Service around the pool is great too. 

The only thing that bothered me was that every time I had to go to hotel registration for anything, I was in line for a good half hour before I gave up because it was not moving. It was very irritating. I waiting in line for almost 30 minutes for them to tell me that I couldn't get a new room key (I accidentally demagnetized mine) because I was not the one who rented the room. On the bright side, at least they were not going to give keys to random people so I felt a little safer.

HUGE tub with jets, a very roomy shower & closeted toilet. The toiletries were lush as were the towels. My only complaint? Get better toilet paper!

Caesar's is one of my favorite hotels on the strip because I love the location, theme, and design. However, I do have some complaints. Even though the rooms in the Octavius Towers are nice, the walk to and from the casino and lobby was tortuous; almost never-ending at times.

We stayed here because we wanted to eat at Mesa Grill in the evening and wanted to be in the same hotel as the kids (yes, we're mean, we didn't take them to Mesa Grill with us.)

There was plenty of good and a little bad, but the short version is, it's not the greatest hotel for kids.  There's a time to spend a lot of money and a time not to, but frankly, kids don't have the most sophisticated taste and don't appreciate the finer things so much.  If I am going to spend $17 on a burger\/fries\/drink in the food court, it better either know how to style my hair or give me a big O.  But really, they're just standard fare for double the money.  But, you're kind of captive because if you take your car out of the valet, there might not be a place for it when you get back.  (True story.  We had to self-park the night before we left because the valets were all full.  This made checkout a NIGHTMARE because it is a LONG way to the self-park with several suitcases, laptops etc.)

I loved the room.  We were in the Octavius tower.  This is the newest one I think, and it's highly renovated.  The beds were super comfy.  They have a ginormous spa tub in the bathroom that takes 30 minutes to fill.  My advice; don't get in until it's close full, or you'll get bored before you can put the jets on.  Try not to feel too guilty for using SO MUCH WATER in the desert.  (I failed.  I felt guilty so only did it once and stayed in there long after I was bored so as to get good use out of it.)

The pools are gorgeous.  I wish there was more shade near the pools, but the lounge chairs are comfy.  Drinks by the pool (like the food court) are crazy expensive.  One small pina colada:  $18.  HOLY CRAP.  I'm glad I didn't order the large.  I only brought a $20 down from the room with me.  I am such a poor plebian, not worthy of the Palace!  If it hadn't been so hot, I wouldn't have left the poolside except to eat, sleep, poop.

Aside from the not-so-exciting-and-way-too-expensive food court, there are lots of good dining options if you can afford them.  Mesa Grill is awesome as always (though now that we've found a local-to-us place with amazing lamb chops for 1\/2 the price of Bobby's, not QUITE as awesome).  We really enjoyed the Gordon Ramsey grill as well (though somehow the waiter there managed to convince my husband to try a $25 bottle of BEER.  It was good, not $25 good.)   We had a pretty nice meal at the casual Chinese food place in there.  We never made it to the buffet because the lines were always crazy (and again, the prices so high we couldn't justify bringing kids with us when they'd be just as happy eating McD's.)  

I do not like that you only get ONE internet connection in the room.  My husband, the kids, and I are all geeks.  We had to pass the laptop around.  That is seriously lame.  

Check-in was horrible.  I stood in line for about an hour.  Apparently a few hours before arrival an email came to my box inviting me to check in online, but, Muppet News Flash -- I was travelling at the time and didn't see it til later.  If it had come the night before I'd have been able to do it from my previous hotel.  

I'm giving them a 4 star overall because my biggest complaints are price related.  If you can get past the prices, it's a great hotel to stay at overall.  If it had just been me and my hubby I probably wouldn't have balked so much.  If you're budget conscious, even with ""I'm on vacation"" face on and expecting to spend a good deal of money, you'll spend too much time thinking about how much things are costing you.   Don't bring your kids.  I'd be willing to stay here again with just my hubby, but I am not sure I will.  I'm tempted to stay at Paris so I can eat breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi every day without having to walk, and it's probably a bit cheaper overall.",2,2,0

Our rooms were in the Augustus Tower, which had its own registration desk, a short walk from the main entrance, but accessible to an even more convenient side entrance off of Flamingo with a requisite cab stand.  Our standard room, non-smoking with king bed, was spacious and had a beautiful view south down the Strip overlooking the Bellagio's fountains.  The bed was comfortable, perhaps not as comfortable as the ones I've found at the Cosmopolitan, Palms, and Hard Rock, but the pillows were very nice with good support.  The bathroom was equally spacious with a glass shower, Jacuzzi tub, a large vanity with dual sinks, and a separate W\/C.  The only minor critique would be the 42"" flat panel TV, which seemed to only get standard definition signal.  Not a problem, though, since we spent very little time in the room.

Below is a copied email which I wrote to their customer service after a recent visit to their property. Several days later, all I received was a boilerplate response basically saying sorry your experience sucked, I hope you'll come back and give us another chance. Why should I? They've given me no reason to.

""As a Las Vegas local, I often have visitors from out of town who I take to the Strip for various events or sight seeing. On 7\/11 my sister was in town and we were going to see Mariah Carey at the Colosseum. We arrived early so that we could do some shopping in the Forum Shops. I valeted my car at the valet closest to The Otherroom. There were no hours posted at the valet there and no signage as to pricing. It was hot though and I really didn't care how much it would cost as I was simply wanting to get out of the car and have some fun. The temperature inside the forum shops as well as in the casino was WAY too hot for summer in Vegas. We did not enjoy shopping or going through the casino because we were sweating bullets by the time we made it to the Colosseum. Once inside for the show we bought some (extremely overpriced) water and sat down to wait for the show to start. At 35 minutes past the time the show was supposed to start we both needed to use the restroom after having been sipping on that overpriced water for so long. We made our way up the stairs and once at the top we were told that the show was about to start and if we left we wouldn't be let back in until there was a break in the performance. So we decided to hold it. Once the show was over, there were too many hoards of people leaving for us to use the restroom in the Colosseum so we decided that we'd just stop at a restroom on our way back to valet. The first restroom we passed in the Forum Shops had a line extending into the hallway. At that point I decided I'd just wait till I got home and we proceeded to go pick up the car. We arrived at the valet at 11:03pm only to find a sign that said ""VALET CLOSED. Please pick up vehicles at The Forum Shops lower valet."" That's it. No directions to get there, no map, no employees to ask, NOTHING. If the Forum Shops close at 11, then it stands to reason that the valet specifically for the Forum Shops should be open AT LEAST 30 minutes past that time. At BARE MINIMUM there should be clear signage stating that the valet will be closed and your car will be moved by the time the shops are closed. At this point we had no idea where we were going, we'd already been walking for what felt like miles, we both had to use the restroom which seemed few and far between and impossible to find, and there wasn't an employee or map in sight to help us figure out where our car had been taken to. Finally, we found a security guard to ask. He was the first and only helpful employee that we encountered. The place our car had been sent to was so far from where it was originally, that he couldn't even give us verbal directions to get there, he felt that he needed to walk us part of the way. During our LONG walk, we encountered at least 2 escalators that were non operational that we had to walk up -it might have been 3, but at this point I was practically delirious from the heat, the excessive amount of walking, and still needing to use the restroom so I can't be sure. Once we were finally in the right direction and almost to the valet I spot another restroom located near the L.K. Bennett store. I head down the hallway and just as I'm about to turn into the bathroom a housekeeper pushes her cart in front of me and blocks the door and states ""Closed for cleaning"" to which I replied ""do you know how long it will be or where there is another bathroom nearby?"" and I kid you not, she looked me right in the face, didn't say a word and proceeded to walk away. I was literally in shock at the rudeness.  I never did find another restroom to use. By the time we finally got our car back and left, I was very irritated. I will think twice before I ever bring guests back to Caesars. Valet parking needs signage- hours and prices that is clear and easy to see. In addition, Forum Shops valet should not be closing at the same time or BEFORE the Forum Shops close. They should be open at least 30 minutes later than the shops, otherwise each guest should be informed upon arrival that their car will be moved extremely far away at a certain time. Bathrooms need to be easier to find- again, you need better signage. When it's 115 degrees outside the shops and casino need to be kept cooler. Broken escalators and such should be fixed promptly- not left non-operational with no one working on it and no signs.

He chose this because this hotel is... Caesar's Palace! Caesar lived here! Of course we'd love to experience this, too.

Checking in took forever. We were unaware that you can check in thru text 24 hrs prior to your check in day, so we didn't do that. It took 45 mins before we can have our room keys and the bellhop to take our bags to the room. And so we enter the room... 

It was nice! I loved it! There's a bed, a purple couch... Ooops. The couch has a stain. We check out the bathroom. A tv in the mirror too! Just like the Flamingo! And the spa tub? None. The view? The strip... If not for the Colosseum blocking it. The comforter looked dusty-white, and the hidden part of it under the pillows were white-white. I wonder when they last washed these linen! Papi got confused. Our room should come with a spa tub and all the works. So he called guest services. 

They said we can either stay in this room and we will be given a $50 credit towards food and beverage, or move to our new room. We asked if we can get a credit towards gaming instead. No, they can't do that. So we decide to move to another room instead because we have the Buffet of Buffets and we don't need their f'n food credit, our faces are already stuffed. And we have to use it within our visit. 

48 years later, our bellhop has not arrived yet. We came in at this hotel at 1pm, and it is now 3pm.

So... We FINALLY went to our new room. I know this hotel have different towers but this ours was just a freaking far walk! But, when I got in the new room, voila!!! It's twice the size of the other room! The bathroom is the size of our apartment living room. You can actually put a couch in there and a love seat and there will still be room for our flat screen... and the spa tub! No stains on the couches this time... And our view was the pool... or should I say pools. Pools of glory. Super fancy!

But.
I would not have stayed here if not for the deal my husband found. I would come back to say hi to Caesar and maybe to try the Qua Spa (good reviews), but not to book a room.

The bed was awesome.  Very high quality linens and fluffy pillows made for an awesome nights sleep.  (Well that coupled with the fact that I was up waayy past my bedtime every night we were here)!   Housekeeping was very nice and made quick work of cleaning the room.  We had to wait for about 15 minutes for her to finish.  

This place is spendy.  There is no two ways to say it.  $8.00 for a Coors Light by the pool.  Cocktails were like $16.00.   Never in my life have I paid $16 for a chicken quesadilla.  And for the close to $300 a night, I probably wouldn't return.

Absinthe is a big hit show and is very popular here. As a benefit you don't have to enter this hotel to find the big circus tent where the show is held. Furthermore, the restaurants help boost this hotel beyond it's extravagant and off putting design. Mesa grill is a decent place though there are decidedly better options even in the strip for the price point. Raos, Guy Savoy, Ramsay and even Nobu are names people in the business will recognize. The rooms here are alright but it is neither the most comfortable or romantic, as they advertise it. Caesar's is in the cusp, already feeling quite dated due to it's unnecessary and cartoonish theme, but it does not help that even among other strip hitels, this one reeks of extravagant abundance.

I must say I love this hotel! I had a great time, the food was great the pool was amazing and the casino dealers and staff made it fun and very enjoyable playing the games. I've never stayed at a Harrahs resort before usually I stay at M life and I will prob stay at a Harrahs resort from here on out.... At least gamble.

1. Bacchanal Buffet : I've tried majority of the Vegas buffets (Aria,Bellagio,Mandalay,Wynn,etc..) but Cesar's easily took the cake. The dinner buffet was outstanding. The variety and quality of food made it worth the weight gain. From Prime Rib, Briskett to the Deserts I would highly recommend this buffet regardless of price.


2. Pool: I stayed at Aria a few months back and was so disappointed in their pool that I went elsewhere when I wanted to relax in the sun and swim. Cesar's Palace pool area made me feel like I was living luxurious. Beautiful pools with great vibe to make you feel you are really living in a palace. There are waterfalls with blackjack in the pool. The best pool so far I've been to in Vegas..... I wouldn't really say this is a party type pool but highly recommend you become royal here.

3. Gambling: For anyone who is I to gambling you'll understand me on this. People gamble for the enjoyment and fun of the game while making money and if you lose it it's okay cause you had a great time, you pay for entertainment. I've always stayed with M life resorts (MGM,Mandalay bay, Aria,etc....) and have gambled a lot in the past, majority of my trips but the rating system and comps for mlife has become so horrid and cheap that they just don't want to give anything in return. They told me at aria you had to average $130 per betting hand to really get good comps or let alone comps at all. I used to get comped buffets,hotel rooms, promotional chips all the time and that's what brought me out but they have declined so much and never comp anything that I've decided not to gamble at their resorts anymore. I stayed true to my word and haven't...... People should realize this as well.

One day into playing at Harrahs resorts (Cesar's palace,Paris and Planet Hollywood) they comped me a room and sent me offers as where I never receive anything anymore from mlife other than a 30% off your room..... Cesar's has a handful variety of games with very good and friendly dealers. The floor get to know your name and your story making you feel part of the them.

The hotel is beautiful, the room are very spacious with a big hot tub and glass shower, the food is phenomenal and even though it's pricey we don't go on vacation to be cheap, esp in Vegas.

Thank you Cesar's and Harrahs for an amazing experience.

I have stayed in most of the major Hotels on the strip and I must say I will NEVER stay here again!! The experience was terrible from start to finish. So many issues, they are impossible to list. Check-in was horrible, waited in long lines for 45 minutes just to be told no room was available (cleaned) yet and it was after 4:00 check in time. Waited until almost 6:00 p.m. to get in a room??? Room was old and furniture was all damaged and scrapped up, curtains were torn. One day room was not made up at all, and we were out of the room most of the day. When I called guest services to get maid service I was told it was our fault, the room was not made up because the red light was on?? This is not true, the green light was on indicating we needed maid service. Every time you call guest services, they are rude and un-helpful and the guest is always WRONG? Some of the overhead Bathroom lights did not work. No extra toilet paper is left in the room so when they do not come to make up the room we had no T.P or clean towels. Also you only get three towels per day? There is NO COFFEE provided in the room (free of charge) they want you to pay $13.00 per day for a few K-cups and some sugar and creamer packets!! Outrageous . . . .even Motel 6 gives you FREE coffee each morning!! There was a Keurig coffee maker in the room so we went and bought our own coffee and supplies. Once we did this, they stopped giving us PAPER CUPS for the coffee!! Really, I am not kidding . . . .how CHEAP can you get!!

Checkin: We were asked to come back an hour later because the room wasn't ready. Not a big deal because we were shopping in the mall anyway and as another added benefit, we were upgraded to the Augustus tower from the Palace towers. 

Dirty Rooms: Our room was clean however there was a slight smoke smell (we were in the non-smoking section). It wasn't a big enough deal for us to switch rooms but it was noticeable. 

I've stayed in a total of four hotels now (Palazzo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Caesars) and I""ve been comparing them together trying to get a ranking going on and Caesars would be in 2nd place. Palazzo is still my favorite (you can refer to my reviews for information on it), but the location of Caesars gives it a big advantage. With Palazzo, I hated having to walk so far to everywhere. It was nice being able to get pretty much anywhere I needed to be (Bellagio, Aria, Venetian, MGM Grand, PH), via light walking or the tram. 

Bed: A+ Very comfortable
Safe: Box attached to the wall, very shallow
Location: Augustus Towers would be more appropriate for anyone who spends more time on the Bellagio side of the strip. The entrance to Augustus Towers is right near the stairs to go to Bellagio, trams. 
Parking Garage: Incredibly hot, they need to create more ventilation in there. Depending on where you park, the walk can be far and walking through that garage is like walking through the Sahara",0,1,1

If you're in need of retail therapy, the forum shops have four floors of jewelry and clothes for you to buy. The shops are a mix of High-end stores like Micheal Kors to affordable clothes like H&M.

Upon booking there was no mention, even in the fine print, of the reservation that you had to call to specifically request a dog friendly room. Luckily with less than a month left until my trip I had the foresight to double check the reservation. The woman on the phone the first time was excruciatingly unhelpful. She told me that there were no ""dog rooms"" (pet friendly?) available during our stay and that it was my fault for not calling sooner. When I asked to speak to a manager she transferred me to Expedia (!?) to see if they had a pet friendly room in the block of pet friendly rooms they allegedly own at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas. I was skeptical at best. The man at Expedia clearly could not understand me. He was more confused than I was about what was going on and he gave me the run around for 40 minutes calling Caesar's and putting me on hold. At the end of the call he could not book me a room and nor could anyone at Caesar's. Frustrated that I was not originally put on the phone with a manager when I requested I called Caesar's back. I spoke with the nicest gentleman (the only reason this review even has 2 stars is because of him) and he was so helpful. Instead of pushing me off onto a third party vendor he found a solution and booked me a pet friendly room at The Cromwell, a boutique sister hotel of Caesar's Palace. I really appreciate this young man's service and I would give him 5 stars if I could. Caesar's Palace however needs to get their ducks in a row and make sure their cliental has ALL the details before they book rooms.

After walking from the parking lot to the lobby which we schlept our luggage approximately a half mile (No exaggeration)  We checked in and schlept  the luggage for another half mile.  We got to our room opened the door and found it to be occupied.  Tired of walking, I contacted a maid and tried to explain the problem, after she realized what I was saying she stated ""that happens often""  I telephoned the front desk and was immediately given an upgrade.  So I had to return to the lobby and get the new room key.  We were directed to a new tower.  Upon entering I noticed the room looked nice.  When going to take a shower the shower tile was full of black mold, the water drained slowly and the previous residents hair was stuck to the drain.  Several phone calls to fix the problem and plenty of exasperation.  

12 dollars for 3 k cups of coffee, 25 dollars to use the gym, internet was not free (i used my hot-spot so I don't know the cost)  7 dollars for a beer in the refrigerator, but considering that was the price for a beer at the bar at least they are consistent.   The prices throughout the casino were high, this caused me to leave the Casino and go to a casino that at least had decent prices.  A beer at a local casino was $ 2.75, I put the rest into the slots. Caesars is too big to fail!, and to big to manage.  Wynn, encore, mirage is much better.  Caesars should hire Steve Wynn to decorate the place.  Might help, though i'll never go back.",2,1,0

1. Parking here is really ample, there's a lot that leads to the back part of Caesar's Palace. Park on the 5th floor on the outdoor rooftop for easy elevator access without walking too far.

2. The check-in counter from the parking lot is a long ways away! Try to take the Appian Way to cut through most of the building and read them signs!

3. The $20 tip trick holds true here, try your best to score an upgrade to another resort room!

4. No resort fees! Though I think the price is just built into the hotel total price anyway.

5. The Bacchanal Buffet is tremendous! I wrote a review about it separately from this one about the Hotel itself.

I stayed here multiple times with different people. My family and I visited some time in 2005 and stayed in the nicer suites. It was really comfortable, the decor was awesome, and the jacuzzi tub was a plus. Fast forward a bit and in the last year or so my girlfriend and I wound up in Vegas for our first (of many!) trips to Vegas. I was excited to relive my experience in a suite that my family and I stayed in.

There are a few things that cause me to believe that whoever designed Caesars was a guy who wanted people to walk long distances for no reason. The property for Caesar's is humongous. I mean walking through the whole property would probably be a nice day's exercise. Everything is far apart.

What probably makes the least sense is the fact that the parking lot and the hotel lobby area are really far apart. The last thing that I wanted to do was to walk with all my luggage to the check in counter that was about ten minutes away. The other thing that bothered me was that the room elevators for each of the individual towers was also far, far away. It seemed like there was no central design in mind for Caesar's Palace.

Anyways, it's good to get exercise, but one of the bigger design flaws is the lack of signage that tells you where to go. It's hard for first time hotel guests who parked in the lot to find the lobby area by navigating the vast ways around the hotel floor. Besides the complex design, the whole casino feels like something that is semi-transformed from being part of old Vegas legend. It feels kind of like some of the games have seen their fair share of days. 

The rooms within the casino though are pretty comfortable provided you do not get hooked up with the rooms near the parking lot. The day we came to Caesar's, we tipped $50 to get a ""complementary"" upgrade. As a side note, $50 is way over paying, usually a $20 will suffice! Anyways, the room we got upgraded to was comfortable, but I would say that there were many small issues with room cleanliness. Speaking of which, the service is mediocre and is typical, nothing to rave about, but pretty standard in Vegas.

The bottom line is that if everywhere else in the 5 star hotel category is sold out\/expensive, I wouldn't mind staying here again for cheap. Otherwise, I  would say that staying at this hotel is pretty skippable.",1,0,0

It was nice and fairly large, but there were no plugs, only an extension cord running behind the bed. There was one wall plug behind the curtain where the cover was actually hanging out of the wall with a lamp plugged into it! That just didn't seem to safe.
The positives: the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very large.

I realize I was in the cheaper tower of this hotel and I actually used the app Hotel Tonight to book the room so it ended up costing me $54 for the night so if I had the chance to stay there again for that price I would. If I had to pay full price I think I would look elsewhere and happily walk down the strip to see the sites.",3,1,1

My wife called to point out there were no robes (we're in an expensive room).  ""We don't do that any more"".  Come on!  It's not a ton of money, obviously, but just not very hospitable.  Normally stay elsewhere, but the show we're going to was at Caesar's so we decided to stay here and save on taxi.

I know Im just a little fish in the grand scheme of things but I cannot believe how lousy this stay was!

I hate to say this but honestly, I had a horrible experience at your property.  I was assigned to a very nice, reply renovated room, unfortunately that's where it went downhill.   Sunday was peasant enough, no issues, until I went to bed after a long day or aggressively working a conference (NAPA). I went to shut my blackout curtains and they would not close all the way.  Their was a 10-12 inch gap where the tracks wild not allow the curtains to come together.  I literally could have read a book with the light that streamed in but that wasn't the worst of it.  The morning sun woke me up waaay too early and started my day off on a miserable note.

After cleaning up I called down to guest services and told them of the problem and they said they would have someone come up to fix it.  I went to my conference and came back up around 2pm for a break.  That's when the room sounded like a freaking train was running through my room.  Apparently the front desk person chose not to tell me that construction would be going on in this tower until 5pm.  NOT GOOD!!!!!  I went to close the drapes and saw that no one came up to fix the curtains so I called down again to ask for it to be fixed.  

I went back to work my conference and came back up to get ready for a dinner event and noticed that the curtains STILL were not fixed s I called down for a 3rd time.  Guest services????  I'd say NO!

After my 3rd request an engineer came up to my room and said he wouldn't be able to do anything about it so he proceeded to safety pin the curtains together.  Ok, thanks for the band-aid.

The two days at the conference were the most miserable hotel room experience iv'e had in 25 years of going to conferences and traveling for business.  Last year I had ~110 hotel room stays so this is saying a lot.

We stayed in one of the Palace Premium rooms which was located very conveniently close to our favorite Bachannal buffet I was very impressed with how clean and well insulated our room was.  Normally in other Las Vegas  hotels we have stayed at there is a lot of noise in the hallways.  During our stay, I did not hear any noises outside of our room at all.  There is also a lot of attention to detail all around the hotel with the statues, plants and marble floors and columns.  I didn't get a chance to check out the pools, maybe next time. The free drinks that were served to us  while we played were nice and strong and not watered down at all.  The slots were a little tight but I would definitely stay at this beautiful hotel again!",4,0,0

I've played poker quite a few times in the Caesars poker room, and it's definitely one of the best in town.  The have two rooms... the main room for cash games and another for tournaments.  It's pretty well run, and if you call in advance you can get on the list for some games.

They are rather large and it takes forever to get anywhere, but the room itself was great. We'd booked in the Augustus tower and they ended up upgrading us to a suite in the Palace tower. First complaint was that the guy checking us in didn't bother to tell us that we were in a different tower or that we'd been upgraded, so we ended up going back thru the line to get our questions answered.

The room was spectacular even though it was way more than we expected. Two-person jacuzzi, his and hers bathrooms. King size bed and 3 different toilet areas. The TV's in the room were way too small and the remotes didn't work very well. 

I tipped the maid after the first night and apparently that wasn't up to par as she didn't refill the coffee or do much on the 2nd day.

Here we go... 

Checkin was kind of a drag...they only had 2 people working the front desk, hello! It took me about 30 minutes to check in and the line wasn't even that long, but the guy was very apologetic when I got to the front with a sour look on my face. The concierge was SO friendly as well the bell man who brought up our bags. The taxi cue was great, really funny guy. The little shop in the hotel is SO overpriced I wanted to smack someone...you mean to tell me this pack of smokes is $13??? Bottle of Diet Coke $6....Where's Ashton? It's Vegas. Prices to be expected...sort of. 

I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip and I thought Caesars was just as it should be. We stayed in the Forum Tower (which I would TOTALLY recommend). Not sure if any of you have stayed in the tower...but that's where you SHOULD stay. The beds were soooo comfy...room was cozy, updated (fabulous bathtub!)...yada yada yada. Honestly though...you go to Vegas, not for the rooms...you go for the experience...casinos, shows, food, nightlife. I mean the room is important, but you just want someplace to sleep for 4 hours or so. This is great place to do it. 

Great restaurants...Mesa Grill (Bobby Flay), Beijing Noodle 9 (BEST KUNG PAO SHRIMP. EVER!!!), Guy Savoy...I mean really people. 

Nightclubs, Pure...I saw tons of stars...such a celeb hangout. The place gets so crowded though...I mean, to the point where my face was in some guys armpit, at least he was wearing deodorant. 

I like Caesars...its a big hotel, clean rooms, nice service, cool dealers and a Las Vegas Casino...I mean what else?

I did this in hopes to prevent the same headaches from the years past. She made numerous notes and on the day do my arrival I called to verify my room and  was informed it was assigned, alI had to do was show up and there would be no issues. It was also documented I was arriving late as that too has been an issue in the past. I showed up and was told sorry no room available...oh and you only pd x amount so you get the palace tower. Umm no..the reservation special was for the run of the house, any tower, cost not an issue. I got in an argument with the lady at the front desk, Karla, to the point where I needed to speak to a manager. She called him and I noticed a few eye rolls which is not acceptable. Justin, the supervisor came up and again proceeded to point out I only pd x amount. Umm ok, so you need to mention that again when that's not the issue? Justin did set me up in a better tower which is nice and all, but the manner in having to get that was not acceptable. I'm upset with the attitude from him and Karla, and the fact that after numerous emails and effort on my end I was dismissed like garbage. So in order to get what I was supposed to in the beginning I had to create a scene? Nice....great  customer service there. I can honestly say if it wasn't for business, I would not be spending my personal money here. I emailed customer service last year and received nothing but a canned response. I was also in a scooter and no accommodation was made as no space was available. I did contact ADA and it was documented on their end. I did receive an email from management, but it was  a typical canned response of oh this shouldn't happen, I'll speak to Karla, hope you have a good stay, etc. In speaking with others at this  conference they too were not given the room reserved. One was given a smoking room when he specifically asked for non smoking. As he was a late arrival they gave it away. He asked about it and they said, rooms are not guaranteed.

Ceasar's Palace...you were a great trip...but you did send me mixed messages at times.

What you need to keep in mind:
-ROOM TYPE, ROOM TYPE, ROOM TYPE.  Research what you are booking, go to YouTube and look at video reviews...this will greatly impact your stay experience.
-Agustus Tower: Big room, not a great bed, sunken tub with jets is amazing.  Double sinks are luxurious...but overall appointments are average considering you have to pay more.
-Casino is oddly shaped...I have never liked playing in Ceasar's because it's dark and super smokey (not near the outside doors - no air circulation)

We are Total Reward members and every time we've stayed at other properties we've looked at Caesars and thought it would be a nice place to stay. This trip we got it out of our system. This was a one time stay.

II'll begin with the check in process. As many others have noted, slow, slower, slowest. On a Sunday night too!!! There was no organization to the lines, just two long bending lines and there was no one from the hotel to expedite the process or to tell you where to stand. After about 45 minutes(fast compared to some other reviews), we finally reached the desk. The clerk, Monica was very pleasant, thanked us for our patience, apologized by saying they were short staffed, and proceeded to check us in. Short staffed seems to be the norm since every night during our visit the check in lines seemed to be the same length. 

We got to our room and it turned out to be a smoking room, even though we reserved a non smoking room. I called the front desk and I was told no non smoking rooms were available, they would send someone up to spray the room but then we would have to leave for 45 minutes. I explained the spray would only be temporary since we were on a smoking floor and the smoke from other rooms would eventually make its way back in. They said there was nothing they could do, they would arrange to move us the following day. After I requested a follow up from a supervisor, the front office supervisor called me back about 45 minuted later saying the same thing. She said she would make a note and we would be moved as soon as possible the next day. As soon as possible wound up with me making several calls the next day despite assurances I would be called when the room was ready. The room was ready at 4 PM and I was the one who called the get an update on the progress. The room was very nice so no complaints about it at all. However, the ice machine on the floor was broken with a hand lettered sign that appeared to be there from a few days prior. The machine still wasn't fixed when we checked out 4 days later. Small complaint, I know, but if the machine wasn't working in a kitchen, you can be assured it would have been repaired immediately. It seems like maintenance isn't a big priority.

Overall every time I dealt with customer service, they were very pleasant and said they would do their best, but the system itself seems to need an upgrade. The amount of time wasted and phone calls that had to be made shouldn't have happened. This was a one time stay at Caesars.",0,0,0

I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.

I had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. 

When I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.

I asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.

After I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.

A small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. 

I went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. 

I told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).
I had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. 

I found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.

I had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The décor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.

The beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.

All night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.

I discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).

I ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.

They had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.

On our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. 

Another friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. 

You can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.

The TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar\/Las Vegas promos\/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.

The pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond\/7 stars.",4,0,0

My first impression was, ""chilly"". I mean that literally, you need to wear pants and a light sweater to be comfortable in here.

I just play tournament poker, so I'll give my impressions of the two $65 + 5 add-on games I played in.  The add-on is only 500 chips on top of a stack of 2,000.  Blind levels every 30 minutes offer little time to play solid poker and forces more aggressive play very early.  Not my style, unfortunately.

The drink service is pretty quick, I'd have to say.  There's a food service available too, and one a.m. massages at the table.  Not bad, though I've always hated card players on T.V. getting massages during the World Series.

As magnificent as it may visually appear and sound glitzy, Vegas newbies looking for a luxury experience should learn that Caesars Palace is not really on par with the resorts it attempts to align itself with. It is steps down from Wynn, Encore, The Venetian, Bellagio and The Palazzo --- the ""big 5"" on the strip, which are collectively the only Five-Diamond rated casino-resorts on Las Vegas Blvd. Caesars may have had his own empire, but he just happened to not make the legitimate luxury-club cut in Sin City.

Caesars Palace is on fighting ground with Mandalay Bay at best. It's a second tier upscale resort.

The hotel and casino are getting rather dated and because the entire property itself heralds back to more than 50 years ago and has expanded every decade, you will see parts of the resort that look shiny and new, and other parts that look like you're strolling through a 1960's movie. It's rather bizarre and unsettling at times, especially when you're hammered.

The biggest problem I have with said expansions that occur in intermitting bursts is that it has created sprawling and confusing grounds that literally pass off as the ancient Roman Empire itself: a clusterf*ck of numerous hotel towers that appear to grow from patches of randomly placed restaurants, show buildings, gaming areas and stores without any real coherent planning. Good luck trying to make your way around this place, especially from the front desk to whatever hotel tower you're checked into. Those faux direction signs everywhere don't help.

But don't get me wrong. It's not a bad Resort. The property seems never-ending and thus has every sort of amenity...so you're guaranteed to have every need and want fulfilled here. From shopping to live entertainment; buffets to energetic nightlife, you'll find it here.

But unless you're willing to fork over the astronomical prices for one of its ""newer"" rooms for a real 5-Diamond luxury resort experience, take a look elsewhere.",15,11,8

What I like:
- Great freakin' rooms.  I was recently upgraded to a suite on a high floor at the Augusts tower and the views were amazing.  Perfect view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  The beds were comfortable and the in room hot tub was kick ass.  
- Probably the best casino to stay at in Vegas if you're a hardcore shopper.  The Forum shopping area is huge and has a great variety of luxury and mid-level brands.  I often find myself buying the most stuff here (aside from the outlet mall) when I'm in town.
- Huge gambling floor.
- Baccannal Buffet is great.  Totally love the great selection of food ever since the big renovation a couple of years ago.
- The colosseum is a great venue for shows.

What I don't like:
- Huge gambling floor also means lots of gamblers - and that means it gets pretty smokey here after awhile.  That's saying a lot when I'm a smoker myself.
- Can get pretty expensive to stay here versus other casinos of comparable quality.
- Not exactly the cheapest place to gamble.
- Wish their famous restaurants didn't feel like it was all ripped off from NYC (Nobu, Mesa, Serendipity, Old Homestead .. etc)",5,1,2

I hadn't stayed at Caesar's since a customer service debacle a decade ago. But I was comped a room so I decided to take chance.

Big mistake.

Customer service is as bad as ever. They have no check in lines! It's basically an all man for himself opportunity to find a makeshift ""line"" to meet with one of the three clerks at THE HEIGHT Of CHECK IN TIME AT 3 P.M. Further, I was comped the room so when I asked if the the ""resort fees"" were comped they checked and said that if I don't use the resort amenities (i.e. wifi, gym) I wouldn't be charged. 

First off, the room, although it's a large 700 sq ft size is no where near the quality and layout efficiency of a Venetian or Palazzo. The layout is so bad that you still feel you are in a 350 sq ft room. 

Second, the rooms still need updating. They aren't keeping up with the other premium hotels on the strip. Get some new carpets please!

Third, the pool was closed late afternoon to accommodate a company party. Since when do company parties take precedence over tons of hotel guests? 

Finally, at check out, I WAS charged the resort fee of $28 per night even after confirming I wouldn't be charged for not using wifi or the gym. Worse yet, I had to go to the customer service line again to resolve. I was told that unless I had the name of the customer service rep who told me about the non-charge they couldn't help me. I gave them a physical description and they said they would get back to me in an hour via text or phone call. Nothing at all. I called after 12 hours and a couple of weeks afterwards, no one responded. I ended up getting charged for the $28 per day resort fee. Now, most casinos do not charge for resort fees for comped rooms so this was very sneaky.

Bottom line is the customer service is still bad and deceitful. If you want to wait in long lines just to pay them money, be my guest and book the once proud Caesars Palace.",0,1,0

If you would like to experience CAESARS,  Take a $100 bill, light it on fire and watch it burn for about 2 minutes as it leaves a bad stench in the air.  Yep that about sums it up.  WARNING: this will be a long review. ..
I stayed here for 5 nights and 6 days for a convention that i had to work.  From that point of view, very poor service and they nickel and dime you all the way. Charged us extra for moving meeting rooms.  Moved us out of areas we thought we had in the middle of our days. The escalators to convention rooms are Filthy gross.  The bathroom sinks in convention area are so calcified that very few worked.  
As a hotel guest:   Rooms have bare minimum unless you want to pay.  They do everything they can to keep you gambling.  No free wifi. VERY limited TV stations.  Fridge is $20 a day unless for medical reasons.  Keurig coffee pot only that they do not provide any K-cups.  Broken light switches. Broken safe. Cracked moldy tile in shower.  Pool is over-packed, can't get a chair unless you want to pay $200 or come when they open.  Water is FREEZING cold and it was 105 outside.  Then the barrage of the sales women (Palace Tower) trying to give you free samples to lure you into their store is annoying and uncomfortable.  Its like being in Mexico. I had to pass that at least 4 times a day.  Oh and you can hear your neighbor taking a shower as if he was in YOUR bathroom! It is outrageously loud.  Luckily we both woke up at 5 Am every morning but I was on vacation, I would be ticked! 
As a customer. ... EVERYTHING is outrageously expensive.   I thought going to food court would save me money but any full meal ran you  $15-$20 for fast food!  $7 for a Venti Mocha at Starbucks.  Went to Homestead which is a upscale steakhouse and they wanted $28 for 3 slices of bacon! The forum casino bathrooms smell like sewer.   Nothing there was what id call reasonable in pricing. 
As a gambler... terrible gaming!  Never seen so many dollar and $5 slots.  You hardly see slot attendants because nobody wins enough for a hand-pay or has any money left to get change. I literally only saw 2 during my whole stay and i gambled every night.   Never heard anyone scream with excitement over a win which is very common in casinos.  Slot selection is severely lacking and even small wins are minimal.  It takes me 7 mins to smoke a cigarette and $20 on a .30 cent machine should last that long. Nope, it rarely ever did. I am an avid gambler and i have never experienced losses like this consistently from day to day.  Ie: I went to Fremont st and my $100 lasted me 8 hrs while here, it was about an hour.   Poker room had only one no limit game going.  Then the kicker... I played video poker at the bar and ordered a virgin daquiri and I was charged $4.80! I have NEVER been charged for a drink while sitting at the bar gambling.  I was appalled.  
I am afraid they have tried living on their name alone.  Their attention to service and detail is greatly lost.  Their greed is also evident. I will never return to Caesars by choice.  It was a terribly expensive experience!  Come to the Forum Shops but not to the Casino.  UCK!",6,2,0

Got the money back but was rudely informed that the fridge wasn't for personal use. (Ummmm sorry but if Im gonna pay $200+ a night for your hotel room, I'll use your fridge for whatever the f@ck I want to) Overall, I think Caesars is desperate for money (they're in huge debt) and is taking the wrong approach on trying to screw guests for small things.

My partner and I stayed here 4 nights. We wanted to use the mini bar to store some milk; so on the first night we called to have the mini bar emptied (it is packed right to the brim). The guy on the phone says no worries, he will organise someone to empty it. A few hours later we come back - the fridge is still full - by this stage it is later at night so we pull out a few bottles of soda to squeeze the milk in (soda doesn't go off right?). The next morning we call again, and are informed there is a $25 fee to empty the mini bar, or a $25 fee for an extra fridge. We think that is ridiculous, so they suggest using the ice bucket to keep the milk cold. We decide to do that, and put the soda bottles back into the fridge the same way they were removed - no big deal I guess.
Then, upon checking out we receive the invoice - a $25 minibar restocking fee, and over $50 on charges for items from the mini bar (we used nothing). The lady at the front desk informs us she will remove the item charges, but there is a ""sensor""  that registered the items being removed , so we will still be charged the restocking fee. Because we removed the items in the first place. So, $25 just for taking the items out, and putting them back?
Further, a total of $122.44 in ""resort fees"" - which we knew about, but are a complete rip off considering its winter and the pool was actually closed (resort facility) and the fitness centre if you want to use it also costs and additional $25 per session (something I also thought was a resort facility).

I go to Vegas for the pool experiences, which at Caesar's is a total FAIL.  

They have two pools right next to each other which both play different music.  In one ear you get crappy country music and in the other you get 3AM deep house.  Being at the pool at Caesars, felt like being torn in half by dueling lions in the Roman Coliseum.  Instead of providing towels when you enter, a strait jacket would be more appropriate, since that is what you will need when you leave.

And the food ?  Two stale dry falafel wraps, two average tasting bloody Mary's and two tap waters... which took 45 mins to get.....  $78 .. So, basically while be tortured by nails on a chalk board, you get food that I wouldn't give to my dog .. and fork over $$$$ for it at the same time.

And best of all, they already know there is a problem.!   When I politely asked about the music issue to the waitress, she said..' ya, good thing you are not sitting over there, closer between the two speakers... I don't know how those people do it over there'... she then put her finger to her head like a gun and went 'POW'.

It's basically the classic example of how a corporate mentality has ruined Vegas and the right hand does not even know there is a left hand.  Different departments, directors, managers (located in Kansas, New York or whatever) all with TPS Reports and not one of them has come down to see or experience first-hand what they have created ...  let alone have the balls to do anything about it.

Joined some friends from Colorado and checked in for a personal staycation twice, once for each of the past 2 years - courtesy of Samantha. Both stays were comfortable and service was swift. During my first caesar's palace experience - with two other ladies - our room overlooked a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains. We were driven there by a service limo and driver was very nice and helpful. When we got to the hotel, bell service took our luggage and we ran up to our 2-queen bedroom. Toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, even cotton buds were ready in the bathroom drawers. Towels were plentiful. We would make use of the jacuzzi to soak our tired feet at night. 

Second time around, there were 4 of us. We checked in to a suite with a king size bed separate to the living room. Called for an extra bed and staff brought it up to us in less than 5 minutes. We were also welcomed with a table full of fruits & bottles of water. Plenty of space to lay things out. There is no free wi-fi. You would have to pay by the hour. So what we did was head down to the starbucks right by the elevator lobbies and lounged there to access the internet. 

Forum shops are not too far of a walk away. We strolled around the casinos and headed to serendipity - which is right out the main entrance - for breakfast the next mornings. Luxurious shops surrounded us but you have to realize that you don't have to spend a dime to enjoy yourselves. At times, Cleopatra and her guards hang out at the lobby and welcome pictures. Check out the Elton John and Celine Dion gift shops to view memorabillia and souvenirs. Luxury can be found in every corner. There are endless things to see here.",1,0,1

The room was absolutely stunning, the décor, the cleanliness, everything was absolute perfection. My husband and I were very impressed.

However, if you make a reservation at any CP restaurant, make sure you will attend. They charge a cancellation fee if you do not. We went to Mesa grill and it was very good. 

Overall, a very nice hotel, with very nice people. They let us check in early and treated us very well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,0,0

1. General outlay: GORGEOUS classical Roman architecture which I gazed upon often from my room window, the pool, the conference center balcony...big sigh... Your décor is elegant, classy without being the least bit tacky. Cesar's palace you are one beautifully adorned lady and I could walk your Italian marbled hallways and never tire of gazing at you!

2. Room: Was upgraded to a two queen non smoking room from my requested single king bed room in the Octavius tower overlooking THE POOL. Perfection. I lounged in her Jacuzzi bathtub, luxuriated in her waterfall shower, slept in a very comfy bed with ENOUGH pillows (I am a pillow hog).

3. Service: My dear lady has hired so many helpful and always friendly staff from the quick no-bother check in, the nice people who clean, the lovely folks working at the pool...every face had a smile.

4.Things to do: Where to begin? Huge casino with many open chairs at slots. Tables were full in the evening but many free seats during the day. Many restaurants, some of the best in Las Vegas but PLAN TO PAY ALOT. We stuck with Michel Richard's Central located in the main lobby. They have the BEST cosmo's on earth. There were shows there but we didn't go to one. We enjoyed standing at the main entrance watching all the dressed up super rich pull up in their limousines though.

5. THE POOL: Come to this place JUST for this lovely lady's pool. Several roman style pools about 3.5 feet deep scattered amidst plentiful chairs and literally beds to lay on in luxury. Wait staff will come around but not quite often enough so there's a food outlet with a ""cocktail window"" What's not to LOVE about a cocktail window?? LOL I'll never be the same after my blackberry mojito - dee-lish-ous! Amazing tiled pool floors, water fountains. I find I simply don't have adequate words to tell you how much I loved the POOL.

Gambling: Not a big gambler but if you are on the squeamish side, I enjoyed playing the penny slots. It took me nearly 2 hours to lose 20 bucks there and I got 2 complimentary drinks. I also enjoyed the video poker (quarter single bet per draw) at the bar right in front of where the betting on sports games is going on. Sorry can't remember the name of it but you can't miss it. Had a wonderful Bailey's and coffee complimentary while playing - nice and STRONG. Highly recommend. 

Nice extras: Privacy button and a clean request button easily within reach from the bed. Hey, don't want to get up this morning? You can just roll over and flip a switch and no one will disturb you! You will WALK a lot. Now I'm a runner and struggle with getting enough exercise while traveling. Not at Cesar's! I put over 10,000 steps on my pedometer EVERY DAY. This is one huge place so if you have a hard time getting around, they have scooters for rent. Soaps and stuff in the bathroom are very high quality. I often do not use them. These I stuffed in my bag and took home :)

Minor issues to be aware of: You must pay for use of the spa\/workout facilities- daily, you must pay for wifi -daily. The long hallway between the Octavius tower and the Bacchanal buffet smells like ass. I mean really bad. I have no idea why. People smoke everywhere but here's the deal - you barely notice. Cesar's has some amazing ventilation and I barely got a whiff of smoke. The food everywhere is EXPENSIVE so don't plan on staying at Cesar's on the cheap. In fact nothing at Cesar's is cheap, come with cash but in my opinion she's worth every penny!",2,0,0

In only one day they managed to change my perception of the hotel. Walk into my room and the entire place was fumigated with a rotten stench. Immediately I start looking around and find LEFTOVER food in my mini fridge. On top of that the food was moldy, OK so I'm paying over 500 for two nights and I can't get my room properly cleaned? Mold! That's a health hazard! Mold does not form over night!!!!   I have to call 3 times before someone came to clean. Housekeeping comes and forgets the cleaning supplies on our room counter. My shower didn't drain. At all. People next door flush their toilet and we get water coming out of our sink. As if that wasn't enough I find blood stains on my pillow cases!!!! Blood stains? Really that is so gross. I have family in town from Costa Rica thinking it's an exceptional hotel and this is what they see. At this point I'm livid. I want to be compensated so I go speak to someone and their idea of compensation is to switch my room to another. I have 3 families in two different rooms with tons of luggage do you know what a hassle that is? No that's not a compensation that's an inconvenience. Manager David comes out to speak to me after 20 min of explaining WITH PHOTOS he agrees to speak to our third party so that they could refund us. I call Travelocity they need to speak to the manager. They call 3xs and the employees refuse to transfer the call to him claiming he was unavailable. I am forced to come down to the lobby I ask to speak to him once again and he tells me he never said he'd tell them anything. He screamed at me and my party in front of everyone at the lobby claiming he wasn't going to refund anything because he didn't want to. "" we can argue for as long as you want I'm not going to help you."" What type of customer service is that? A manager? Supposedly no one with a higher position there to speak with but he provides no type of help. Right off the bat he was rude and extremely unprofessional. I will never be staying here again. I spent three hours trying to communicate with these people on my mom's birthday and on vacation. I'd give Caesars palace a 0 in stars if I could.",5,1,1

This is my first time in Vegas, my friend who I'm vacationing with has been a lot. He checked in last week Sunday in the Augustus tower, his room is really nice. Huge tub with jets, and a walk in shower. His bed is much nicer. I arrived Thursday night, and although we are paying the same I was put in the Roman tower. The only way they could put me in the same tower as him was to pay a huge fee. If I had know then how horrible this room was I would have considered paying the fee. The Roman tower is clearly very dated, and in bad shape. The bathroom in my room has a very small tub, that is incredible stained, and the closet is in the bathroom. Also upon check in my toilet was not working, and they were unable to fix it until the morning. The room is very bare bones, no coffee maker, fridge or anything. This would all be totally tolerable, but the thing that makes this room so horrible is the insanely loud music and Base, nonstop since about 11pm. Its now 2:30 am and has not stopped. I called the front desk to ask what options I had, and they told me to buy earplugs downstairs. When I asked if they had any I could come pick up, they told me no I had to buy them. It looks like I will be sleeping when Vegas does... never. Good thing I have itchy sheets and dated wallpaper to keep me company. Also the view from my friends room is stunning, it over looks the strip, my view is the roofs of a building all painted beige...


extra things, unless you book a resort package wi-fi is 14.99 a night, for 2.5 an even larger fee for 10. If you happen to have a coffee maker, its about 12 dollars to make coffee so bring keurig pods with you.",3,2,2

This used to be my favorite casino on the strip because of its stature, reputation, history, location, comps and pool! Not any longer! Our most recent stay here was an absolute joke of an experience. 

We arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night and valet was completely full. We then drove around to the rear self parking and carried our bags nearly a mile to the Hotel Lobby. Self check in was broken. We had selected a smoking room in the PetSuites section of the hotel. We were told that we had been upgraded to one of the nicest rooms in the hotel and that room would be equipped with dog bowls, beds, treats, etc. 

We arrived to our room and found that it was a non smoking room. We then noticed our room was looking directly into the roof and parking garage - definitely not one of the nice rooms in the resort. We then noticed that there were no dog beds, bowls, treats or anything dog related. We called the front desk and they said they would bring up immediately. We waited about 90 minutes until 12:30am to receive dog items that were included in PetStay rooms. 

The next morning I woke to the maids coming into the room un-announced. I went to make a coffee using the in-room coffee maker and found out there is a $16 charge to make your own coffee. 

The $34 daily resort fee does not include much - internet is 1mbps - coffee is $16 - service was terrible from front desk and concierge - room service was horrid and outrageously expensive.

After one of them finished helping the people in front of us, we stood there waiting and both clearly did not want to help us.  Finallly one guy gave in and called us up (we were not dressed trashy),  the whole time he helped us check in he did not smile.  He booked us into the Roman Tower and we had booked the Augustus Tower.  When we mentioned it, he told us they have more high rollers booked into those towers, so we felt ""not worthy"".  He handed us our keys and points to the left and really said ""over to the left""  that's it,  we have been to Vegas many times for years and I would have to say I never been treated worse checking in at all the hotels on the strip.

Please refrain from rubbing up against each other in the main pool. kthxbai.

The room was nice, modern decor similar to what you'll see in nice hotels in urban areas. Very large, but a bit warn (dents in the wall from the doorknob, a kid had scribbled pen on a chair, chipped corners on the furniture, etc.). Great bathroom, but needed upgrading. The shower floor was spongy and the jacuzzi tub didn't work. BUT, at 11:30pm we called the front desk and they sent up a repair man to check out the tub - how's that for service?

After a wonderful stay and show with Shania Twain, the front desk changed the rate on my hotel stay at checkout.  The desk left me to wait 45+ minutes while they contacted their billing department to straighten it out.  They then said I owed 200 more for a two night stay.  I tried to give them the info from my confirmation regarding rate on my package and the manager was only interested in getting me to go away as I was agitated after waiting 45 + minutes to get them to sort everything out.  The manger (anthony Pyne) then went on to complain to me that sorting out my account would take up the rest of his day but he would give me a call before charging anything to my card as I refused to sign anything.  Lo and behold my card has been charged and no call from them.  Apalled at customer service manager attitude that my ""billing dispute"" would waste his time for the rest of the day, wouldn't even try to go through his math with me which was obviously wrong.

The room seemed to be newly renovated and had although the view was non-existent, the lamps made for nice lighting. There was a separate living area from the bedroom separated by a type of partition with a TV in each portion. The bathroom was spacious with his and hers sinks and a nice big walk in shower. I however had multiple issues during my stay. One was the multiple hairs I found on the pillows as soon as I got into the room from checking in. Suffice to say I was super grossed out about it so I called guest services and they sent someone up right away to change the sheets. I couldn't really say they were as apologetic or as surprised as I thought they should have been but it was fixed right away and I was happy. My 2nd issue was about the drilling during my 3rd day there started at 9 in the morning. I called guest services again and apparently they're renovating something else. Renovations are always great but guests should be forewarned. I normally wouldn't mind since it's Vegas after all and being in the hotel room during the day isn't my idea of a vacation; but of course it starts on the day I plan on being in the room to do some work. They told me the room would be ready no later than 2 and that they would call me once it was ready. I did not receive a call but instead had to call instead. By the time we got into our new room, it was 4 pm. We get a Petite suite in the Forum tower which is nothing like the Julius tower. It's older looking compared to what the other room had and the room is dark with dim lighting. There's no separation of rooms and only one TV. I called guest services again saying that I feel like I was downgraded for something that was an inconvenience to me but instead got the run around with no sympathy whatsoever. The rep said I could go back to the Julius tower if I liked but really, the tower with the drilling?!? I received no real apology and so I just gave up; after all it was one last night. Little things happen once in a while which is unavoidable but service recovery is the key; Caesar's Palace is subpar from my standpoint.",0,0,0

Large tub, separate shower, his and her sinks and separate toilet room. The beds are comfortable and the robes perfect for day napping. 

Pool - well, poolS. They have 7, but with that said they really have the two main larger pools. One was cold, one was warm. Amazing mojito drinks (32oz.) run about $24. AHH! So needed on these hot summer days though. Pool s crowded in the summer, go early if you want a group of lounge chairs together. Better yet, get a cabana if you can afford it. 

Food - I think Caesars has a great variety. Some of my favorite Vegas restaurants are here. Bobby Flay's Mesa is amazing, and the new Gordan Ramsey Pub & Grill is very good as well. They have one Starbucks in the hotel and anytime after 9am you will probably wait 30 mins in line. Usually its worth it, compared to the off brand coffee shop they have.

The Forum Shops - Walk right on over to the shops without ever going outside. YAY! They have some designer stores (think GUCCI, LV), then they also have an H&M and Ann Taylor. The Forum also has more restaurant choices like Spago and The Palms Steakhouse. They have a little of everything. Perfect if you don't want to be at the pool or gambling during the day. 

Gambling - lots of tables and they seem to have the limits not insanely high, even on the weekends. The dealers we had were generally nice and helpful if you had questions.

Overall, I love staying at Caesars because they have a little bit of everything for everyone, and the rooms are comfortable and nice!",5,1,0

Even with that level of investment, I repeatedly found extremely poor customer service.  I don't think this was a matter of people being rude, but rather not having the motivation to excel in the service arena due to Caesar's bulk business model.  In other words, they don't have to cater to you because they have a thousand other folks in line behind you.  This is truly a shame since I've stayed at larger hotels in Vegas that clearly take pride in the customer's experience.

As for the facilities, my room was spacious and clean, though there were some facilities issues.  My toilet ran, the hot water in the shower required a plumber and 2 hours to fix, my sinks made odd noises at random, and the walls were thin enough that I could tell you the age and ethnic composition of all of my neighbors that week.  The view from my room in the Palace Tower consisted primarily of air conditioning units and the conference room was a meat locker despite repeated requests to adjust the temperature.

The pool was nice, but got almost no sunlight as towers have subsequently been built up on all sides.  This means the pool is in near constant shadow.  The gym was nice, though very very heavily tilted towards treadmills (like 20 of them), so if you're a runner this is the place for you.

The lobby bar had a nice selection of high end whiskeys on the menu, but ran out of two of them during my visit.  For me, the dining highlight was definitely Mesa Grill.  Another plus is the easy access to the Forum Shops, which are quite nice.

In short, (I can't believe anyone has actually read this far down), this is middle of the road Vegas for khaki wearing folks from the heartland.  If you're looking for a high end, sexy Vegas experience, you should look elsewhere (like the Aria, Cromwell, Cosmopolitan, Wynn, etc).",9,3,3

I know the hotel has been around forever, but you can't tell by how well maintained the whole resort is. And it is huge. And I mean HUGE. Having walked thru most hotels on the strip, I feel Caesar's has to be top three for sheer size. 

The check in process actually went pretty smooth. We only waited in line for less than ten minutes before being helped. We were assisted by Zandia and she was great. She made easy small talk, and was super nice in fixing our error. Our group thought we booked three rooms, but apparently we had only booked two, and in different towers at that. She was able to get us a third and put us in the same tower, and on the same floor....right next to each other and with a view of the awesome pool area. That is true customer service. 

The hotel, being so big, can be a little confusing, but there are signs above everywhere to make sure you know where you are going. We stayed in the Palace tower, which is one of the premium luxury towers. We were here EDC weekend  and room prices for this tower were going for about $500-600 a night. The rooms are spacious, well decorated, stocked, have great big bathrooms with jacuzzi tub and separate shower and toilet, as well as a makeup vanity desk (for us girls who need our own space). The shower pressure was great, and in my opinion a bad shower experience can ruin a hotel. My one regret was not being able to visit the pool as we were hereon business and couldn't spare the time. 

We ended up eating at several of the restaurants in the hotel(Mr Chow, Cafe Americano, Paynards-see separate reviews), and all were good quality. The only staff member we found to not lend to our good experience was a bartender at the circle bar closest to the Palace tower. He was noticeably impatient with everyone. Also visited was Qua Baths and Spa. See separate review, but a wonderful experience. 

There was one incident our last night with one of the rooms. It started to develop a sewage smell coming from the bathroom. It wasn't too bad at first, so our friend called the desk to report it. They were supposed to send someone up to ""spray"". That person never came. By morning the smell was so bad the door to the bathroom had to be shut and our friend come to our room to shower. We were three doors apart but thankfully didn't experience the smell. We went to the front desk the next day and they compensated us for the incident. 

Bottomline, I would highly recommend Caesar's. The overall experience is one you would expect for Las Vegas. Bring your money though, because you do pay for the experience.",2,1,2

The kiosk check in was a complete cluster & after spending several minutes there we had to wait in line to ultimately check in.  Got to our room in the Palace tower.  I immediately noticed that my nose started running from the fact that the room didn't seem like it had occupants in a while as it appeared quite dusty.  Walked into the bathroom & it was pretty and newly renovated but I couldn't get past the overwhelming smell of sewage coming from the toilet stall.  Okay, I'm thinking it will dissipate with the door open but it never did.   While taking a shower I was looking at the floor to find a drain because it was filling like a bathtub.   I recently had surgery and need things to be super clean to avoid any chance of infection.   While showering it filled up so much that I couldn't rinse fully.   As I stepped out of the shower I had to be extra careful because the floor is quite slick.  Disgusting!   My legs are itching as I type this because I'm sure it's the soapy residue and backed up water that dried on them.  I complained to the front desk and they offered a new room in the Octavius tower.

I then realized while hastily repacking my belongings that I forgot my personal pillow in the other room.   I called guest services and was informed that if I wanted it, I'd have to walk all the way back to the room!   After I said no, that's not going to work for me, I was disconnected    The gal called my room back and said if they find my pillow, they will have it delivered.  It was just in the other room.

The next step I took left me sliding across the floor and I landed on my butt. If my partner hadn't been holding onto me, I would have probably continued falling backwards and struck my head. Alarmed, my partner asked the security guard what had caused me to fall. The man yelled at him, ""It's vomit, that why I told you to go around!""  

Both my partner and I were people watching, so we are to blame for this incident but I was very disappointed with how the guard responded. First of all, he told me to ""nevermind"" shaking his head and using a rude tone, not ""go around."" Secondly, he did not ask if I was injured or offer to help in any way. My partner had to pick me up off the floor and we cleaned my shoes off in the fountain outside.

The room was pretty nice, BUT on the day we checked out our friend was removing luggage from the top of the TV Cabinet (pretty tall at least 6 ft) and a DUSTY, OLD, USED CONDOM FELL TO THE GROUND. Idk about you guys, but I was pretty pissed that our room ended up not being cleaned from top to bottom especially with it being Caeser's Palace. 

My boyfriend called the front desk and explained the situation and they said they'd send up a manager. We got a call about 10min later from front desk saying they'd comp a phone call that was made for $62 (boyfriend had called me ""long distance"" because it was a call from NV to a CA cellphone - was about 5 minutes long). Obviously that wasn't the point and they ended up sending up the manager. So the manager and another random lady showed up, we explained the story and he pretty much confirmed what had happened. To be honest, I don't think anybody believed us because we all LOOK like we're teenagers but I was the youngest in the room and I am 23, so they probably thought we made everything up.

ANYWAYS, 10 min passed and we got another phone call from some random person who was obviously given the task to call us and he said they'd comp us $50 for the room. Our other roommate then chimed in explaining how what had happened was a completely violation to cleaning standards, but nothing else happened. On the way down I reminded them that they said they would comp the WHOLE phone call and not just $50, so when we went to the Check-Out desk we explained to the lady our story and she was happy to do it (of course she was, so we wouldn't cause a commotion most likely). We all remained professional during the entire thing and kept telling them it wasn't about the money, it was just disgusting and they acted like it wasn't a big deal.

Having been to Vegas a few times, with a budget and without - I have experienced 3 stars and 5 stars.    This would have been a hands down 5 star experience - except for what happened at the very end...

My story begins on a cool summer day.  Strolling in with luggage in tow, a beautiful statue of three bare women engulf the main lobby.   Camera flashes, chimes and screams echo through the open air from the casino floor just yards away.   

The wait was over quickly, and I approached the desk as a woman graciously checked me in.   I was happy to know that my room was located on the 32 floor of the new Augusta tower - where the showers are bigger, the Jacuzzi tub fit 2 if not 3 comfortably and the rooms were fit for a king to be. 

Blah, blah, blah.... You know how vegas goes. Let's get to the good stuff. 

So I order roomservice, and holy crap was this stuff expensive!! At no time did i spend less than $50 for a meal - i mean $10 for Orange Juice????  Okay - whatever....  I'm at a 5 star resort - so 5 star prices.

The real kicker came at check out.   I wanted my point on my card, so I wait in line.    I wait in the Platinum line.  and I wait....  and I wait..... as I see the non-platinum LINES moving quickly.    At no time did a customer service rep. look up at and me and pull me from the PREFERRED ""I SPEND A SHIT TON OF MONEY HERE- GIVE ME GOOD SERIVE"" line.....

And so I leave my special line and go to the line next to me.... and it moves quickly - but just as I am about to go up the girl takes her break!!! 
 
SERIOUSLY!!

Well, as I was waiting in the non preferred line - a rep goes back to the platinum line and is playing on the computer.  I rush over to her and say, ""Ma'am I just need to check out"".

she replies ""Sir this is for the platinum guests only, please remain in your line""
I say - ""ma'am I am platinum, and was here before that man""
--- ""Sir, he was in line and you cut across, please go wait behind him"" 

I turn around and say to the man ""Was I here before you"".... ... ""Yes he was"" the man tells her. 

45 seconds later I was checked out. 

That whole process took me 27 minutes!!!

The following day, I got a message from front desk that they need my same credit card again to complete the procedures.

I got the electronic bill after I checked out. I found there was two bottles of water which I did not consume but charged to my room. I called the front desk and disputed the charges. That was a different guy answered my phone but he handed me up twice until I requested to speak to the manager.
From the service quality stand point, this hotel only deserve one star but because it has a nice swimming pool, I gave a two star.
I stayed in many other hotels on the Stripe before, the service provided from this hotel I have to say is the worst from my experience.

Stained dirty carpet.  80s CRT TV.  Truly An old, filthy, outrageously overpriced, poorly-maintained hotel in a glamorous disguise.  If you want 2 star-worth motel quality room at a 4 star hotel price, be my guest, Caesar will deliver it. 
 
My husband was attending a wk-long conference at the Caesar palace. They offered a standard room to us at a special rate which made it an apparent choice for the stay. 

We didn't have much expectation as we knew it is going to be a standard room after all. But as an acclaimed 4 star hotel in Vegas, we expect their most basic room quality to be, if not above standard, at least decent.  

The hotel looks great and glamorous from the strip but that's all.  All hell breaks loose once you check in.  At first they checked us into a room on the 5th flr in the Roman tower right next to service elevators which was so noisy that we demanded a room change right a way. This time they switched us to another room on a higher floor on the 14th in the same tower.  To our pleasant surprise, they are thoughtful enough to provide  not 1 but 2 shower caps, vanity kit (2 cotton balls, few Q tips, a rubber band), sewing kit.  It has a stand up shower with 2 weak shower heads, mini TV in the washroom, light shutout blinds, a safe, hairdryer, but no tub, no jazzcui, no bathrobe, no slipper - o well, no big deal; but the lack of a fridge, coffee\/ tea, coffee marker, 80s CRT TV just is not acceptable by today's standard.  Even a std Hilton rm has them. Slow In-rm wifi is $14.99 per day.  But here comes the WORST part - we tried to take a shower at 11pm. And guess what, the water came out of shower at the max hottest setting was COLD.  It was so cold that it generated no steam at all.  No way we could shower. We let it ran for 5min at the max but still no change.  While we were half dripping wet, it took us 4 calls to the front desk, every 10mins before a rather handyman-looking ""engineer"" showed up at our room.  He looked at the shower and was not all surprised, and said the most ridicious thing i have ever heard, ""sometimes the water temperature does drop thru out the night. It takes time to pump hot water to this (14th) floor.  Just wait and let it run for 5-10mins until the temperature is ok for shower."".  What?! Are you kidding?!!!  This is NOT a Motel 8!!!!!  We just couldn't believe our ears!  At the end we had to let it run at max setting for as long as 10mins before the water got warm enough to shower (yes, still NOT hot!).  Obviously this boiler \/ water temp issue is a known problem to them. Possibly this is some lowlife hotel management's idea to keep the boiler off as much as possible or they are just too cheap get a new \/ additional boilers, at just to save money.  We called to complain but receive no compensation.  The hotel management should have offered us another room, or even a free upgrade, instead of having this problem dragged on for 1 whole hour and produce some very unhappy customer.  Crappy, non-existent service.  Period.  This is just plainly ridiculous for a 4 star hotel.

Others had mentioned how filthy the carpet.  I watched them seviced my room. For some reasons their maids are trained to vacuum the carpet ONLY at the spot beside the bed but no where else.  Why they were trained not to vacuum the entire room is beyond me. May be another brilliant penny-pinching measure from another management folk.

Dining in any restaurants in Ceasar are criminally over-priced just like anywhere else in vegas but not necessary good quality, unless you live on food court food.  The Cheese Cake factory in the Forum shop is actually a gem.  Price is reasonable for a sitdown restaurant.  Speed is efficient.  Food quality ax the board is consistent and is above and beyond other restaurants in the franchise.  We like their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost for every day we stayed here.

Can I first start off by saying that checking in was probably the most torturous thing... I live in Las Vegas, but I've never had the pleasure of staying at one of the hotels here. Somehow we managed to choose a line with the shortest amount of people but waited longer than those standing lines double ours! And the guy who checked us in put us in the wrong room (and a smile wouldn't have hurt either). Luckily we had a friend who works there looking out for us, we got a call and they promptly brought us our new room keys.

Now aside from the waiting and the little mishap... The room was BREATHTAKING. Absolutely better than anything I could have never imagined! We got a suite in the Forum Towers on the 66th floor and the room was divided into a living area and the bedroom. 

The living area had a dining table big enough for 5-6, two huge windows that covered almost the whole wall with an amazing view of the strip, a large L-shaped couch, a lounging couch, a little coffee table, a TV, and a mini fridge stocked full of everything to quench your thirst (if you don't mind paying the extra money for it...). There was also a little stationary area, a coffee maker and built in controls for the curtains. You may be thinking, ""wouldn't it be easier to just pull the curtains shut and open?"" Well yes, but doing it with a push of a button is even better! And there's even a little half bath!

The room... Oh the room is to die for! There's another huge window in the room with the same great view! A large king sized bed fit for well... a king! It had six super sized pillows and two little throw pillows and all white covers and sheets. Two little couches and another TV. This may sound like it's super cramped in there but it's not! There's more and enough walking space between everything. There's a... (wait for it) lovely walk-in closet that I wanted to steal! The room is very regal looking, yet still has a comfy feel to it.

And the bathroom. Oh how utterly amazing the bathroom was... I was looking forward to having a nice relaxing bath before dinner and the wrong room we were in didn't have one so I was super bummed needless to say but this bathroom... oh this bathroom had a wonderfully amazing jacuzzi tub big enough for two! And the shower had 4 different nozzles (and no, that's NOT overkill). One slanted down, one over-top and two on the side; each with it's own knob and a separate temperature knob. The mirror has a build in TV with a touchscreen remote built right into the wall. Of course, there were complementary soaps and lotions and whatnot. There's beautiful marble and travertine tile (or at least their lookalikes) all over the place which gives it a warm and rich feel to it. Not to mention soft and comfy bathrobes in case you don't feel like putting on your clothes after your nice relaxing bath (like me!).

Mirrors...  there are mirrors everywhere lol... A top ceiling to floor one in the living area, another in the bedroom and a checkerboard wood framed one behind the bed (for... you know... checking yourself out in the morning...). Everything was nice and clean and everything was perfectly in place. The carpet was very clean, normally I like to bring flip flops when I stay in hotels but I forgot mine this time but my feet didn't get dirty at all so that was a major plus for me!

I got a huge break on the price of the room because of my boyfriend's friend, but it was still kinda pricey... However, it was worth every last dollar! And I mean it! We loved the room so much we didn't want to leave, and honestly, I would model my future house based on this room. But checking out was super easy, done right from the TV, which was good because we were running a little late. I highly recommend the Caesar's Palace and if you can, spending a little bit more for one of the suites. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",2,0,0

Makes you feel a little nickel and dimed when you don't even get complimentary coffee.  Upon leaving, I received an email welcoming me to use online check-out, but when I viewed my receipt I found that I had been overcharged for my room.  Luckily I had my email confirmation showing the rate that I had been given and they adjusted it without a hassle.  

All in all though, I give Caesars 4 stars because of the quality & cleanliness of the rooms.  We've stayed here a few times and have never been disappoointed.  Our friends stayed across the way at The Flamingo and had to deal with numerous issues...an overflowing toilet, a light that didn't work, uncomfortable beds, etc.  My daughter and I felt pretty spoiled after hearing about their nightmare of a room!",0,0,0

We booked our room 6 months in advance and had very high expectations.  We stayed at the Palace Tower Room 2618, where the toilet was a constant problem.  It overflowed a few times, leaving the carpets soaked.  I slipped when I went from the carpet to the tile, with my wet feet.  The staff came and fixed the toilet\/cleaned the water, but we were never offered another room.  By the sceond day we could not flush the toilet anymore, and it was close to check out time.  The area by our pool lobby smelled like vomit, as did a few of the elevators.  There was a hole in the wall near the door by our room.  This was unacceptable.  There were few cocktail waitresses in the casino.  The place is very large.  Our friends stayed in the Octavius Tower, which was very far and inconvenient.  The sports book could be so much better.  There were two large screen tvs that were very outdated and the tv screens were blurry.  Overall, I expected excellence at this hotel, but what I got was fairness.

We booked our room over 3 weeks prior to our stay. We booked a room in the Palace Tower that was supposed to have couches and overlooking the pools just as our previous stay. We asked for early check in. When we arrived about 1 pm we were told no rooms were ready yet. They took our cell number and would call. At nearly 5 pmwe went back to check on our room. They assigned us a room. When we got into it the room was NOT the large room as requested when booking. At that time we had a dinner engagement.  Went to from desk next morning at 7 am and politely asked about it. The lady at the front desk was so rude. We told her it was our wedding stay and we just wanted theroom we paid for. She told my husband..oh just go buy her a purse! She did not care at all. 

At the bar across from the front desk the blond male bartender was worse than rude to our party of 8. He insisted they were out of Makers Mark and Jack Daniels. There were plenty of both on the shelf above the bar at the other end.

The concierge was rude when we asked about ordering extra flowers. 
Caesars took what should have been a very special stay and turned the time there into a non memorable experience.  Money was no object but they have lost out because next time we will go across the street and try the Palazzo!

The room was very spacious, nice bathroom with jacuzzi tub, bed was very comfortable and it was quiet. The day after New Years there was a faint odor of cigarette smoke (coming from another room?), in our nonsmoking room and the smell of vomit in the elevator we had to use.

The housekeeping was less than stellar. I turned up the sofa cushion and it was full of crumbs, yuck. You just don't want to see evidence of others in your room before you!

My PG trip with my parents was still amazing!  We booked a package deal where we got Celine Dion tickets which also included our hotel stay at the Caesar's Palace.  There was a minor difference in price between the two hotel rooms that we booked, but they upgraded us to the Octavius rooms (which are newer) from the Augustus Towers.  

Some reasons why our Caesar's Palace stay was awesome:

(1) Octavius tower rooms are luxurious!  Although the Octavius towers are smaller than the Augustus Towers, there is more of a sense of luxury and peacefulness once you enter the Octavius tower rooms.  

(2) Huge variety of slot machines here! Which means hours of fun for me :)

(3) Not only that, but Caesar's palace has so many restaurants to choose from, which makes it very convenient for my very particular parents.  

(4) The location of Caesar's Palace places you right in the middle of the strip and easy to get to where you need to go.

(5) Caesar's palace houses the Celine Dion concert.  One of THE best concerts I have ever seen and one of the best shows in Vegas.  Her voice is amazing and she is still breathtakingly glamorous.

(6) Caesar's Palace Forum Shops are right downstairs.  Tired of gambling?  Or, have you won big?  There are tons of stores here for you to shop at your heart's content.

(7) Most importantly!  The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars is AMAZING!!! It is my new favorite buffet in Vegas!  Stay tuned for my buffet review! :)

Only reason why this place is not getting 5 stars is because the lines when you check in to the rooms are EXTREMELY, PAINFULLY slow.  I wish they had a better\/more efficient way to get their guests in and forward them on to where they need to go.  Places such as Aria make check-in\/out seamless and Caesar's needs to catch up!

I'm only giving it three stars because everything was a- ok, really.  I say this because I was put in a room at the Palace Towers and another room at the Roman Towers, and let me tell ya... YIKES! All those rooms are horrible! The rooms smell funny, and everything looked old! I was expecting something a bit more nicer especially for the price we are paying to stay and dine there.  Finally, the hotel workers were nice enough to put me in the Augustus tower, which is by far the newest and best tower in the entire hotel. The rooms in Augustus was actually decent compared to the other two towers.  One thing I would suggest is... as soon as you arrive in your hotel room, call the front desk and have them change your sheets.  This is not just for cesars' palace, but for most hotels- especially in VEGAS. My sheets were dirty, but they were nice enough to accommodate me.  Actually, the entire Cesar's palace stuff was very accommodating through my entire stay.  I'm guessing they had to be accommodating because there were over 2500 folks from the same organization I was with staying at this hotel.  Knowing that, the staff was probably trained to be more hospitable with us. 

I can't speak for the shops or spa services.  The gambling tables\/casino was pretty standard, and the room service was decent.  The lady who's in charge of the kitchen during room service at night (I think her name is Linda) was very helpful.  The food came out quickly, and the food was also decent.

I was here as part of a conference (about 80 people in about 40 rooms) and was able to see several rooms. My room had no mirror in the bedroom and a terrible view. Some of my friends had no closet--just a bar in the bathroom. Others had windows into the bathrooms, or walls so thin they could clearly hear the conversation their neighbors were having. People universally complained about the uncomfortable beds.

When checking in, the president of the company was advised that we could all check in at the special ""diamond"" line. But when some people tried, the desk clerk sneered and told them to get back in the regular line. If you aren't there to gamble, service is pretty poor.

The hotel was enormous and very poorly signposted. It was easy to get lost and turned around.

The conference room was freezing and the food was *atrocious.* Food that we paid for ourselves cost an insane amount--$24 for breakfast at the Augustus Cafe, for example.

You had to pay for everything--the business center, to work out...everything. LAME.

We came up with our two kids to go to the iheart music festival. Which was great btw. We booked what was supposed to be a 1400sqft suite. There is NO WAY our room is 1400 sqft. It's nice, with a couple couches and a table. But there's no fridge, no microwave (you can get both for $30 a day for each one) no pullout bed, the thermostat only goes to 65 which in vegas equates to your room remains at about 75. There's a pretty good size shower but only one, piddley little shower head. But the worst part is that the side of the hotel that we are on faces the Cromwell, which has a dance club on the roof that is open until 4am. They play their music so loud, and this hotel is insulated so poorly that you can hear every lyric to every song played until 4 o'clock in the morning. Neither of my kids could sleep a wink until the club closed, and NO ONE cared one iota. I called guest services (aka guest disappointment) every single night we were here. All that happened is I got passed around to various people for an hour or two each night. I had the pleasure of speaking to one particularly useless security guard that interrupted me, outright said no when I asked her to listen to me, and hung up on me. On night 4 a supervisor offered to refund my resort fee (30 per day) for 3 nights which I told her was more insulting than a show of good faith. They didn't even offer to change our room. 
It was like pulling teeth to get housekeeping up to our room if we weren't ready the first time they came (around 9am). We literally just had to call 5 times to get the bed changed bc my youngest son had an accident. It's 8pm and they just now knocked on the door. No joke. 
Their pool closes at 6pm so there's no taking the kids for a dip before bath time. No going down to sit in the hot tub with a beer after the kids go to sleep after a long day sightseeing. You have to go in the middle of the day when you're out doing other things if you want to use the pool. 
We asked valet to bring our van around so that we could get our car seat out...took an hour and a half. AN HOUR AND A HALF!!!!! 
They lost a room service order, they refused to let us have more than 2 blankets in the room despite the fact that we're paying $35 a day for a rollaway. They argue and try to refuse the request for extra towels even though there are 4 people in this room, their ATM charged me $1000 when I only took out $500...I could go on and on. What it boils down to is extremely, extremely rude staff who couldn't make it more obvious that they don't give a hoot about the guests experience or customer service. Every employee with the exception of the girls that work in the shop by the lobby and some people on the casino floor made it very clear that they would budge for no one. Not even a glass of chocolate milk for my kid after he got cut twice on the back of the neck by their knife like handles on their furniture. I know it probably sounds like I'm nitpicking. But honestly, we are not difficult people to please. All we ask is to be able to sleep warm in our beds, be able to dry off after taking a shower, have housekeeping do their jobs and have our concerns heard. I'm not complaining to get something for free. We have very valid concerns and complaints that we wanted addressed and all we were met with is apathy and excuse making.

We just spent Thanksgiving weekend in Vegas where my wife's family lives.  We thought we'd make it into a nice vacation too and got a room at Caesars.  We'd never stayed here before and were really looking forward to it.  It started off pretty good, then rapidly descended to one of the worst stays I've ever had.

When we arrived, the Valet sign at registration said it was full.  WTF?!  I told my wife to just stay there and I ran in to get our room.  I upgraded to the Augustus Tower Deluxe room and ran out.  Luckily, the valet went ahead and took the car and it was a relatively short walk to the room.

The room itself was actually really nice.  Great jacuzzi tub and a nice bed.  The pillows were worn out feather pillows that needed to be replaced, but the rest of it was nice and had a cool modern look.  You have to pay for the coffee, which I thought was pretty ghetto considering every other hotel I've ever stayed in gives you free coffee, but that's the kind of crap I expect in Vegas.

Then things start their rapid decent.  We ordered room service.  My stomach has still not fully forgiven me for that mistake.  We got fried chicken and a chicken soup.  The soup was good.  The fried chicken was something that they pulled from a KFC dumpster, stuck under a heat lamp for 5 hours then took up to our room.  It came with a discus... oh sorry, that's right, it was a biscuit.  Took a bit and a liter of water later could finally resume conversation.  Eating a tablespoon of all purpose flour would have been preferable.  Needless to say, we stuck to the restaurants from then on -- Payard is actually quite good.

Then next batch of horror was coming and going to the resort, since we were visiting my wife's family we had some visiting to do everyday.  Well, the valet at registration was ALWAYS full!  So they made us go to the colosseum area -- on the opposite side of the resort from our room!  It was at least a 15-20 minute walk every time we needed to go back and forth from the car.  Had I not upgraded to the fancy new tower, maybe that would have been better, but as it was it made us dread coming back every day.  Long day, exhausted, sleepy -- no worries, have a nice 20 minute walk, cross two separate elevators, go through two smoky casino areas to get to your room!  Methinks not.

The other horrible thing was the room was making us sick!  Seriously, the second morning of our stay both my wife and I woke up congested and had a sore throat.  Later in the day we realized that it was the heater!  We would start to feel better and then the heater would kick on and we started getting congested again.  I turned it off and opened the air vents on the window and we both started feeling a lot better.  Ultimately, I think that saved me, but unfortunately my wife got a full on cold that I blame on Caesars.  Maybe it's because they are still doing some construction on other parts of that tower?  I don't know and don't care, it's unacceptable.

Sorry for the long review, but really there are lots of great places to stay in Vegas so why deal with this kind of BS.  I know next time it's back to Bellagio for me...",2,1,1

We were charged over $500 for the room! I called to express my concerns and was on hold for 15 minutes. The customer service and registration was a joke. I was offered $25 for my inconvenience and told no other rooms were available. I escalated to management and somehow a room magically became available. They only budged when I said I would dispute  the charge on my credit card along with sharing the video I took of the black stuff coming out of the sink. The furniture was beat up and tired. The carpet was gross. And there is no coffee in the rooms. You have to pay $13 for 4 k-cups to use in the rusted keurig machine.

Instead, I figured I'd make use of my Total Rewards Players Card to book a room in one of their upgraded towers.  My rationale was that I would be fighting with one of a million NYE travelers, and they would likely honor my reservation for a nicer room since I legitimately book through their website using my Players Card. 

Well, guess what?  I show up and my friends who booked through expedia.com end up in a upgraded King Suite, while I end up in the crappiest of crappy room in their oldest tower ON A SMOKING FLOOR.  I mean, really?  A smoking floor?  Who has those anymore? Of course, I call and complain.  This is NOT what I am paying for.  They were unable to transfer me to another room, but said that they would give me a $50 discount and transfer rooms for me the next day.  They stated they would call me between 11 and 1 the next day to arrange for the room transfer. 

Well, guess what? They never called.  When I called the Front Desk to inquire, I was placed on hold for 30 minutes before being hung up on, TWICE.  So, I gave up.  Next, i thought, why don't I order some food?

Well, guess what? Room service showed up 2 HOURS after I placed my order, an order that consist of a plain ol' burger.  No apology, no discount despite having complained several times.  

I checked out the next day.  And I NEVER got the $50\/night discount they had promised to me.  Whatever, go figures.  

I go to Vegas several times a year.  Caesar's has lost a would-be loyal customer forever.  AND, they have lost a would-be loyal gambler as well.  I won $2500 Caesar's in 2009, and I'm never letting 'em have it back.  Take your money and run. 

If you are looking for a great place in Vegas, I *very highly* recommend the TRUMP HOTEL. There is no casino there, but the service is amazing, every room has a full kitchen, and the rooms are huge!  The staff there even made evening arrangements for me: chauffeured me to and from Tao nightclub and got me a line pass so that I would get right into Tao.  Free of charge.  Seriously.  Try the TRUMP. 

If you want to stay somewhere with a casino, I recommend ARIA.  The hotel and casino are beautiful, and they have the best buffet in town.",2,1,1

as a gambling hall, caesar's will take your money.  as a place to stay, i think staying in the forum tower is worth it as it's newer, but it's really pricey just for a night (fortunately i get comped rooms).  as a place to eat, eat anywhere besides the buffet.

the decor is somewhat mixed; some tacky, some classy. but hey, this place is classic las vegas, so no matter what caesar's will always be a palace.

We finished our vacation at the Venetian where we had an incredible time....read below for the full story.

I would go back to Caesars for the restaurants, and Forum Shops...which you don't need to stay there for.  I wouldn't stay there again.

This all comes down to Customer Service.  I also gave them several chances to fix this and they didn't so I have no problem sharing here.  I booked a non-smoking room, at least six months in advance.

When we arrived, they offered us an upgrade as soon as we got there.  Great...all seemed fine.  We get to our room and it smells like the last guest stomped out his\/her Marlboro light just a couple of hours ago.

We go down and tell them we reserved a non smoking room.  They tell us, they upgraded us to the Roman Tower, but that all non-smoking rooms were taken...""we're very sorry.""  The guy actually said we weren't in a smoking room, that it was ""smoking optional.""  My wife replied that she was glad it wasn't ""smoking required.""

Too make a long story short, they allegedly couldn't get us a non-smoking room until the next day.  The night manager told us to come back at 11am the next morning and they would give us a non-smoking room.  At 11am the manager on duty explained they couldn't give us a room until after 4pm, since no one had checked out yet.  That makes sense, but I was done with Caesar at this point...thousands of rooms in this hotel, even more in their sister properties and they couldn't find one non-smoking room.  They didn't even care to try...every answer, without even walking away from the desk, was...""sorry.""

That didn't work but it sure took my deposit .when I arrived at Caesars my room wasn't ready the type of room I requested wasn't given to me nor was my niece who is staying with me in a room close by as I requested months prior. The lady who checked me in at the diamond check in name was Jessica and she was not very friendly at all. When I inquired about why the room I requested wasn't given to me nor was my niece niece put next to me she told me I should read the fine print on my reservation. I told her my host booked the rooms nearly three months back and we had requested certain rooms at this time it was late in the evening we've been standing at the Diamond check in for over an hour she was not helpful so I just took the rooms that was given to us.. The room wasn't bad although it wasn't very clean there were roaches in the light fixtures the sheets were torn and upon check-in I requested an extra blanket and extra hangers and they were never delivered. After waiting an hour and a half I finally went down to the lobby for some dinner after returning the items were still not in the room I called twice more to get the items I requested my room was comp the tickets were comped and yet I was charged for the rooms and all comp items. I was double charged for the deposit on both rooms . Charged for my comp tickets.I spent most of my three days there trying to get the money back that they double charged me for and basically didn't have any great time at all. The service was lacking to say the least the only good service was in the diamond lounge by the young women working there it was awesome however it was the only night we could get the diamond lounge because the line was over an hour long . You couldn't get a drink on the casino floor to save your life when I approached one of the bars on the casino floor the bartender told me to go sit down and wait and perhaps some will come by and take my drink order I asked if diamond players were allowed to get drinks from the bar and she said she didn't care what my status was. The only good part was my host. Who is the only one working on my have to get all my money returned that Caesars overcharged me. The room in the Augusta tower is ok at best it  needs to be refurbished needs to be clean  and  cockroaches need to be gone I cut my players card up and left it at the front desk I would never go back to Caesars and and probably never stay at another Caesars or Harrah's property.

Tagged along with wifey's conference and brought the baby and in-laws too. Our meeting rate was 210\/night in the Palace Tower. We stayed in room 1004 and the room kind of overlooked the swimming pool.

Here's a recap of the stay:

Pros:
- Caesar's Palace is HUGE - has everything you need and you literally don't ever have to leave the property. There's food, games, wide range of restaurants, shopping, pool, clubs, etc. 
- Middle of the strip, so it's a good location to streak up and down Las Vegas Blvd.


Cons:
- It's an older hotel; the whirlpool didn't work and the temperature of the water was temperamental. 
- Not baby friendly. They wanted to charge 30\/night for pack and play and 20\/night for a mini fridge (for breast milk).
- Wide range of people. I like to stay with people around the same age as me. The hotel accommodates everyone from the broke college students to the grandparents that are shuffling to the Rod Stewart concerts.",2,2,1

Like any other hotel, there were some small issues but I have very few complaints.  

I booked a room in the Octavius tower and used the option to request an upgrade for $29.  The valet\/check-in area was crazy busy when we got there and there was a sign that said valet parking was full and to keep going to another lot.  When we told the valet that we were checking in to the Octavius tower, he told us to leave the car there and enjoy our stay.  The lobby was packed but we proceeded to the Diamond check-in area and were the only ones checking in at the time, so it went fast.  The girl helping us was friendly and even asked if she could help us with tickets, offered us water and gave us the upgrade with no problem..  The walk to the elevators is a long one but it's away from most of the crowds so we didn't mind.  With the upgrade, we ended up with a great a view of the entire pool area from 63rd floor!   

Our room was clean and decorated really nicely.  GREAT marble bathroom with a huge Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, really nice toiletries, double sink, huge vanity area and even a TV.  The bed was super comfy and had tons of pillows.  

The bad...well, $13 for in-room coffee is just robbery.  Seriously Caesers, you must be high!  The resort fee was supposed to cover internet for one device but I was still charged $4.95.  Not a big enough deal for me to argue over but I guess everyone should check out their bills carefully.  The line for Starbucks in the morning was insanely long but I guess when your other option is two $13 Keurig pods, standing in line isn't so bad.  And there was a really bad sewage odor all along the walkway to our elevators.  We smelled it on Monday afternoon and it was still there Tuesday morning when we checked out.  

Luck or not, we really loved our stay here and hopefully if we come back, we won't have any of the bad experiences so many people have written about.",1,1,1

One of the biggest perks to this hotel is the location; pretty much center strip.  Lots of other places are within an easy walking distance.  You can also pick up the tram in the back of Belagio that will take you to Aria and the Monte Carlo.  The shops attached to the hotel are very nice.  There are also plenty of dining options right in Caesars. 

We had a nice room overlooking the pool.  The room was spacious with a large bathroom and two sinks.  The closet was large which was a big help since I had to bring  attire for the conference I was attending. There was a nice seating area with a couch and a single chair.  

They used to have fresh air vents on the windows.  Those appear to be screwed shut.  The TV was ok; the picture looked very analog and the sound was grainy.  But if you're in Vegas, you're probably not watching a lot of TV.  

The wifi was so-so.  We used both the regular and high speed.  Both performed about the same. The signal in the seating area wasn't that great.  It got better if you moved closer to the door.  I had a number of messages that were stuck in my outbox that had to be resent.  Wifi is free with the ""resort fee"" for the basic, and more money for the high speed. 

Like most casinos, they have free parking which is nice. The valet is free as well. The valet was very handy during our stay; especially towards the weekend when it got busy.  The valet staff was always friendly and asked if we needed directions whenever we were leaving the property. 

We were charged and early check in fee since we arrived before 11AM; rooms weren't available until 4PM. (The $20 sandwich did not work for an upgrade in my case). 

The pool is sweet. They have a few to choose from.  Ample seating.  But it always helps to get there early for a nice spot.

CASINO
Let's start with how the casino has effectively become the United Federation of Douchebaggery on the strip.  Many years ago, Caesar's was the sh-t & it only took $10k to be treated right.  Then one day, all the hosts up & left, taking their high rollers to Mandalay Bay & Caesar's Palace was effectively f-cked.  Caesar's had always been pretty dependent on its VIPs & this exodus rocked the place to its core.  With few whales available to sustain the revenue column on the balance sheets, the joint was forced to re-jigger its image.  That's when you started to see all that advertising on Los Angeles billboards for the milquetoast Venus Pool Party & that ridiculous TV show, ""Caesars 24\/7"", positioning the resort as a purported ""hip & cool"" place to stay & play.

Apparently this appeal to the young & infinitely stupid worked:  The tables are packed with guys that have that ""I'm a Maxim magazine subscriber"" look, playing 6-5 Blackjack on $10\/$1000 tables packed ass-cheek to ass-cheek.  One Federline-lookalike got so excited over his $10 double down win I thought he was gonna up & cash his chips in for a Red Lobster gift card right then & there.  Don't be surprised to see at least one dipsh-t thinking he's the shizz & splitting tens:  This always has me in stitches because when the dealer bellows ""SPLITTING TENS"", all eyes lock onto that table for a brief second as if f-cking TeddyKGB himself just opened a package of Oreos.  Then everyone realizes that there's no way this alcoholic asshat with a tribal arm tattoo is doing anything other than being a Grade-A chode.

And then there's the gold diggers crawling all over black chip players like a fart in a spacesuit. Yes, the ghetto 'Paris Hilton' skank parade here is quite possibly at the root of why Caesar's has degenerated from a once proud denizen of upper class well-dressed high rollers to wife-beater-wearing lowlifes that adorn their Ford F150's trailer hitches with ""truck balls"".  The soulless atmosphere of Caesar's casino is a side effect of all the 21-year-old-lip-gloss-laden brats trouncing about half-naked in this biohazard of a casino.  You can sense these self-important harpies leeching the joy out of everyone else in the pit as they shout intoxicated epithets at each other & spill Red Bull & Vodka drinks all over on their ""You say bitch like it's a bad thing"" tank tops.  If they breathe on you, look into getting treated for gonorrhea. 

Take my advice:  Even if you completely disregard the horrendous atmosphere, anyone that plays Blackjack here is a masochist.  Putting aside the obnoxious number of 6:5 tables here, the table rules that Caesars has on their 6-deck shoes are possibly the worst on the strip.  It's indicative of how they're clearly targeting dumb & dumber.  Check http:\/\/wizardofodds.com\/blackjack\/vegas.html for ongoing playing conditions but in general, I've never seen a good game at Caesars outside of the high limit tables.


FORUM SHOPS
What's there to say about this Roman bastion of commerce?  The walkways are loaded with f-cktards that wear faded clothing labeled ""Hollister"", ""Affliction"", & ""USC Football"".  Oh, by the way, in case it wasn't clear, buying anything here is about as enjoyable as a prostate exam from Rosie O'Donnell but what were you expecting?  Going to a 4-star hotel's shopping mall & being surprised at the craptacular markup at ""Brookstone"" is like buying hot wings at a nudie bar:  Wrong place, wrong agenda, dumbass.

But let's face it:  No one you know is really buying anything dangerous here.  While you drink yourself silly at Fat Tuesdays & hurl insults at Pete Rose who's usually signing autographs at the sports memorabilia joint, your girl's gonna get moist over the leather in Salvatore Ferragamo's, ogle the red soles of Christian Louboutin which she once saw on ""Housewives"", then get self-conscious & head on over to Banana Republic to buy something cotton that her self-esteem will actually allow her to buy.  The big ticket purchase isn't likely going to happen here so you can holster that Amex, Tonto.

And you know what else isn't going to happen here at Caesars?  You getting laid.  At least not with anyone that doesn't work for Benjamins & hangs out at Cleopatra's Barge.  For those of you looking for that kind of pay-for-play action, those ta-tas hanging from the barge aren't just a coincidence:  It's an ""open for business"" sign.  Yes, this place is tacky enough that anything with double-X chromosomes & even a few brain cells that can recognize what a classy Vegas experience is isn't going to be bend-me-over-the-mini-bar impressed... which of course only reinforces the explanation as to why there are so many Vegas virgins here.

When we got there, there were no lines. No where that says where we should line up. So some lady comes by and directs us to line up at some random spot in the middle. She directed 4 other couples to different areas. Those 4 couples got helped before us and I'm not sure if it's because we were younger but the 2 girls she put behind us was about our age as well.

From the outside, it really looks like a huge empire with their enormous towers spreading all over the horizon. Inside, Caesars is still classy as always, but the older towers are really outdated and rather than remodel they've expanded.  

I was able to stay in the newest Octavius towers this time around, the last time I stayed at Caesars was over 5 years ago and I remember the room being small and dingy.  They called it a suite, but it's about the size of a regular room. What was convenient is it's located right around the corner from check-in and overlooked their recently remodeled swimming pool with a great view.  The bathroom area is huge though with a jacuzzi bathtub.  We were hoping for a jacuzzi in the middle of the room, though but it wasn't.  Also we were expecting it to be big enough for 3 people (a suite with a large couch they said) but it was smaller than pictured and the couch was uncomfortable so we ordered a roller bed which cost $30 a night.  Wireless Internet access also costs about $12 a night too.

I will say that their swimming pool is a good reason to stay at Caesars.  There are about 5 pools in the area with a couple jacuzzis on the side, and a blackjack swim up resort style area as well (not worth playing though,double down on 10&11 only, no re-split Aces, no surrender).  There are ample amounts of free lounge chairs, which is important because of the amount of pool loungers. You can also charge drinks to your room from the waitresses but you'll need to bring your id.  Prices for a large slushee drink here (pink lemonade, pina colada, strawberry dacquiri) ranged from $13 for a small and $17 for a large.

The Forum Shops and the plentiful full bars scattered thoughout.  Bobby Flay has his Mesa restaurant her too.  Negatives are the only late night 24 hour restaurant (Cenral Michel Richard) is over-priced and the food wasn't very good. They're trying to be more foodie friendly and more than the avg bar but at 2am we're not really looking for that.  I guess we could've ordered room service but they said it would be at least a 1 hr wait and I was hungry.

Not worth the money. Oh... and if you are allergic to smoke, brace yourself! There is no effective ventilation system in the common areas so you may end up with severe congestion and a headache, like I did, for your entire stay.",0,0,0

We arrived Friday around noon so obviously the place is gonna be crazy. We wanted to valet as our car was jam packed. We saw that it was full so we tried to valet at the forum shops but when we told the valet guy we were guest he told us to go back to the front and we will be taken care of. We pull up and sure enough our car was taken in for valet. Our bellman Jim was patient as we tried to pull stuff from our bags before it was stored as it was too early for check in. 
We go eat return and we do wait a bit to check in but that's understandable. The gentlemen checking us in was informative and even though it was busy he mad us feel like we were the only guest and did not rush us with choices. He set us up with a great view of the pool which I recommend over the city view. The pool is majestic. We get to the wonderful room and it was spacious with a jacuzzi. The new bellman that dropped off our luggage oriented us to the room and even got ice for us. Now that's service! 
I encountered many of their staff and everyone looked like they took true pride in their work. 
I loved the dealers at the pool in the water, they were personable and taught me how to play hehe don't get that everyday. My only bad experience with service was the server at the black jack table. I just asked her how much the drink was as I was so used to paying for drinks at pool parties and she just gave me this stare like i was stupid. She was fairly rude and said we just work off tips. I tried asking her a question and she just walked off. She had about 6 black jack tables to serve and she was gone for about 30 minutes before coming around again to ask us if we wanted to drink anything. She was the only one though that I experienced that was rude.
Upon check out I called the front desk and Sheree answered the phone. I remember her name cuz that's my name and she was friendly and helpful upon checkout over the phone. 
Overall great stay and wonderful pool! We ate, partied and shopped here. They had everything we needed.",1,0,0

Sports Fan in Vegas = The Need For a Sports Book Fix
I admit it....I am a sports book whore, so it is about time I actually wrote a review on one. Caesars is the best....the absolute best when it comes to sports books in this city. Televisions galore! There are about 6 screens that are movie theater size lost among 20 other smaller screens.  The seating area is awesome....great Easy-Boy type chairs for you to sit on for your comfortable viewing pleasure. A great way to spend a Sunday in fall during football season, but you must remember the saying ""early bird gets the worm"" if you plan on spending your morning\/evening here. People have been known to get there at 6am to reserve the lounge chairs for the 10am games.

If you don't plan on being early... there are plenty of seats to go around but they do go pretty fast. The cocktail service is great....I love that fact that Caesars always staffs about 6 servers for their busy Sundays. There is always someone around to take your order. The satellite beer\/cocktail carts that they have stationed all around are handy too. The fans that come here are the rowdiest I have ever seen. Always in their fav. jerseys....friendly, cheering and clapping as if you were in an actual stadium. I do wish the food court was a little closer... after 5 rounds of beer and hunger starts to set in, it always seems as if it were located in Utah. Overall, if you want the best sports book experience especially during football season....this is the place to be.",1,0,0

The rooms could be cleaner - I found dirty underwear under the bed in our $350 room in the Octavius Tower!!  In addition, the Octavius Tower is literally half a mile from the main lobby, too much of a trek.

The food court is crazy expensive and not exciting.  

A redeeming feature is the pool, or should I say pools?  There are over five pools and each offers a different clientele.

My mom is a diamond member, which means that she receives certain benefits since she is a ""high-roller."" They offered us three free nights at Caesars, and they told her that we were going to stay in the Octavius Tower, but she requested the Augustus Tower, which is technically a downgrade from the Octavius Tower because she likes the beds better. She has really bad knees and can't get in and out of the beds in the Octavius Tower easily. The reservationist assured her that we would be staying in the Augustus Tower and that the room was secured. Great! We flew into town and upon checking in were told that the Octavius Tower and the Augustus Tower were at capacity and we were being downgraded to the Palace Tower in a mini suite. We had stayed in the Palace Tower once before and requested never to be put in that tower again because it is a much older tower, and despite renovations the rooms seem to have mechanical problems. We explained that at checkin and they assured us it would be fine. Okay, we aren't unreasonable people. We took the room. It's not a great situation to come into a hotel expecting one thing and then being downgraded, but whatever. Not a deal breaker. What happened after, however, was completely unacceptable. We go into our room and it's hot. I mean HOT. About 86-degrees. The room overlooks the pool and has sunlight almost all day. I closed the drapes and turned on the air conditioner, which was only pushing out hot air. Not wanting to complain, we gave it time to cool down while we went to gamble and eat. After about four hours, we returned to the room was still hot. I called downstairs and they sent a repair man to work in our room. We left when he arrived and went to play some more. A few hours later we returned, the repair man was gone and the room was still hot and the a\/c was still broken. I called downstairs and told them that it still wasn't fixed. They switch our rooms for us 5 stories above where we are, which meant repacking our the bags, paying for another bellman. The a\/c in the room worked. We were happy. The following morning we are getting ready to leave and a repair man shows up to repair running toilets that the maid had reported. We had noticed the constant hiss from the two toilets, but didn't want to complain again, but apparently they had an efficient maid who does her job well. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about their customer service and front desk \/ VIP in this instance. He was there all day, changing pipes and doing his job. We didn't complain about it, but here we are in another room, and we have a third roommate. We go to dinner and gamble some and returned to the room at about 8pm. No sign of a repair guy, toilets are still running and the jacuzzi bathtub was not working. We put out the do not disturb sign, get in our pajamas and decide to watch a movie. About twenty minutes into our movie, there's a knock on the door and there is the repair man, who apologizes about knocking in spite of the do not disturb sign and he asked if he could come in to work some more. I allow him in, my 58 year old mom is in her nightgown and he worked away while we finished our movie. The toilets aren't running anymore, but he has to come back the following day to repair the jacuzzi tub. I call downstairs and explain the situation. We are staying in a reassigned, downgraded room and are plagued with exactly what concerned us about staying in the Palace Tower: something is always broken and there's some repair that needs to happen. They didn't offer to change our room again, upgrade us, or do anything to accommodate our stay or to make up for the poor experience they had been providing us because of their faulty rooms. They gave us $100 credit toward a massage that we had and took off the movie rental charge because the repair man was there pretty late working while we watched it. I explained the the assistant customer service manager who I spoke to that this isn't about money, it's about our experience and making it right. We were downgraded, put in a room that was unbearably hot because of a broken a\/ then  were switched into another room that had even more problems and we are now in the middle of a construction zone. To not upgrade our room at that time to get us comfortable is a shame. I told him that I appreciate the $100, but that the room is the real issue. We could have stayed anywhere. The Cosmopolitan, Wynn, and Bellagio all offered us 3 free nights. We chose to stay at Caesars because we have always had a great stay and a great experience with their customer service. I explained to him that I had had a room issue at the Cosmopolitan when I stayed there the first time. The room when I walked in was dirty and the bed wasn't even made, and they immediately upgraded me to a wraparound terrace suite.",1,0,0

Ok, so down to the review. I don't like this place. I just don't think the gambling floor is comfortable and conducive in its layout. For the size of the hotel, the buffet is kind of weak. The selection is limited and the food is forgettable. The vibe of this hotel is also teetering to ""old"", due to natural causes of aging but its more apparent when you compare this hotel to the other new kids on the block, i.e. Cosmo, Aria, Wynn, Venetian. It's still steps up from Bally's-esq type hotels, but Caeser's is no longer synonymous with upscale.

The rooms... If you're unlucky, you'll get the Octavious Tower (I believe) and have to walk a mile to arrive at the elevators to your room. Also, if you book a regular room, you'll run the risk of staying in a room that is on par with the room at the Motel 6. 

The nice thing about Caesers is that its part of the Harrah's properties, so if you record your play, you can get rewards at the other casinos like Planet Hollywood, Ballys, Flamingo, Rio, etc.

Perhaps the best thing about staying at Caesers are the Forum Shops. The ever-evolving forum shops are still cool to stroll through and pick up a few things.",4,0,1

In the room: the bedding and towells are laundered with some kind of industrial detergent,  so if you have remotely sensitive skin,  you'll need itching.   And they have no hypoallergenic option.  The bed itself is comfortable,  but the pillows are terrible.  They look big and fluffy,  but they're not.  They're quite flat, even with two stacked up.  There is a coffee maker,  but you have to buy the coffee for $14. No microwave. The fridge is full of mini bar items that you get charged for even of you nudge them,  literally.  They're is a space for a water bottle left for your personal use.  But you might nudge something.  The bathroom is very nice,  nice shower,  nice jacuzzi, double sinks.  Nice view from our room towards the mirage.  TV with cable. The free WiFi on the 12th floor was pretty weak.  Aesthetically, everything looks nice.  

Like any Vegas hotel,  it's huge and confusing,  hard to get around.  Payards,  the ""affordable"" cafe in the hotel was pretty good.  Good coffee.

The crowd here is definitely drawn in as a result of the glitzy name and not much else. My most recent visit was this past Thursday and will probably be my last time gambling at this casino. 

My first issue was at the blackjack table. The dealers are fine with players using their phones to text and even make calls during a hand because why not, rules don't matter here. This is a great bonus to those people who want to multitask while you're sitting next to them trying to play your hand. The other issue is that cocktail waitresses don't come around ever, no matter how many times you ask. I had a waitress come by after 45 minutes of complaining to the pit boss and when she finally brought my beer 20 minutes later, I already got my own drink. She told me I'm not allowed to have two drinks and said she would come by later to drop it off. Ten minutes later we see her in street clothes walking away as though she obviously clocked out and was done for the day. Even the pit boss Craig said that it was embarrassing and he has no excuses for it. Sadly, this inability to get a drink has happened to me every time I've sat at a blackjack table at Caesars. 

The main issue that is the reason I'm writing this review is the poker room. Floorman John Hayward is the worst floorman I've ever seen. There were belligerently drunk players sitting at our table making threats and insults and repeating racist and anti Semitic comments and the floor man did nothing to stop or resolve the situation. Every time it was brought to his attention he only acknowledged and then walked away. This was terrible to endure and honestly, the Venetian and bellagio both have way more action than the dingy Caesars poker room. They had to have multiple tables short handed instead of combining them just so they could collect more rake. It's sad that the Caesar resort is luxurious in their accommodations but it stops there as the casino itself is more suitable for you more undesirable crowd. Hopefully the floorman Mr. Hayward soon realizes that his ability to control the room is less than adequate for the job he's been given. Perhaps he would be better serving drinks at the blackjack table. It does seem like they are short handed.",2,1,1

I have never had bad service up until this last weekend when I stayed at Caesers Palace.  We chose Caesers because of its reputation as a top notch property, but let me tell you, this place is nothing more than an overpriced Motel 6 with a nice lobby.  

Our adventure started when we went to check in.  After receiving our room key, we trudged around looking for the appropriate tower, and after about 15 minutes finally found it.  Took the elevator to our room, open the door for my wife and she screams ""Shut the door, there's a lady in the bathroom"".  We did not feel like dragging our bags back down again to get a new room, so we used the conveniently placed phone to call the front desk.  Unfortunately, after 10 minutes we were still on hold so it's back to the front desk.  The one nice thing was that the desk clerk apologized and gave us a $100 food and beverage credit.  So off to the new room and fortunately this time it was unoccupied.

For the price these rooms go for on a weekend, we were severely disappointed.  The room had obviously not been refurbished since the hotel was built, and it had signs of severe wear and tear (missing knobs on the dressers, shower doors that did not close all the way, and a front door that had to be pulled shut in order to make sure it locked).  The TV was vintage 1998, and there was no minibar or coffee maker in the room.

About the amenities at the hotel , there is not much to say because this hotel has a severe lack of them.  None of the bars serve coffee, only one I could find served draft beer (and no decent drafts), and there is only one place to get breakfast besides the overpriced buffet (more on the buffet later).  Coffee at the cheezy Java Coast was $4.00 for a small.  Even Starbucks doesn't have the audacity to charge that for a brewed coffee.

As it was a milestone birthday for me, I invited a number of friends to Vegas to have dinner at the Café Lago Buffet.  For the price, which is way more than most other buffets on the strip, the selection was truly anemic.  One small line of food where most others are 3 times the size.  We had only 12 people but they required us to split our party or pay an 18% gratuity charge.   I'm sorry, but I am not going to pay $6 per person just for someone to refill our iced tea twice.  We asked for tables that were close together, but were told (of course) that if we had the same server we would have to pay the gratuity.  The servers themselves were snotty and obnoxious and told us that ""our union fought hard to get us that"".  They must have heard my wife say that we weren't going to tip because they proceeded to ignore us.  Really?  You think you deserve a big percentage at an overpriced buffet to bring us our beverages?  The last straw was after our meal was finished, my wife had a tiny piece of cake left which she was going to wrap in a napkin for later.  The waitress saw her and said ""If you take that cake I'll make sure security is waiting for you"".  

Not only will I never stay at Caesers, I will never stay at, or gamble at another Harrah's property.  If this is the way you treat people at the ""the most prestigious resort in the world"" and a place with ""Impeccable service"" (to quote the website), then you really should rethink your corporate culture.  There are plenty of other places that make an effort to keep their customers happy so why should we spend our money with Harrah's?",8,2,1

I've must have been in the good tower because my experience was pretty good.  Checking-in was a breeze due to the many cashiers working in the large lobby.  Like other Vegas hotels, going from lobby to hotel room here was a long trip.  When someone says, ""Drop your bags off in the room and meet back here in 5 minutes.""  You better tell them to make it at least 15 minutes.

I was pretty high up, which gave me a beautiful view of the Strip at night.  The rooms were very nice and spacious.  Definitely a comfortable enough room if you want to bring several people back and chill late at night.  The bed was also very nice and extremely comfortable.  The bathrooms were also strong--everything performed as it should, and it even had a slightly luxurious feel to it.  I loved the showers.  The rooms weren't cheap, but the experience was good.

Caesars Palace has a few other bright spots as well.  There is plenty to do around Caesars Palace--such as the Forum shops.  Plus, it is very close to some other marquee casinos like the Bellagio.  I've heard mixed on this--but based on my experience, Caesars Palace does a good job of clearing up the cigarette smoke on the gaming floor.  It isn't as good as the Wynn or the Bellagio, but Caesars Palace is definitely more comfortable and non-smoker friendly than a Harrah's or a Sahara.

Arrived before check-in time and told room was not ready unless I paid an extra $35 for early check. So, room was ready just trying for a little revenue bump. Dropped bags at bell station for the day - getting them out of hock can be slow. 

The room: I was in the Forum Tower and these could only be described as dingy and in need of a good cleaning - a remodel would be best. Worst bathroom lightning I have ever seen - the eco bulbs had to be warmed up like a 1950's Philco TV. The furniture was beat up and scratched and the couch had many mystery stains. 

In general, the room did not feel clean and did not have any matching or cohesive styling. The room had a coveted Vegas in-room coffee machine, but alas it was not free - they were selling the K-cups via the mini-sensormatic thing for $13. Yikes!

Room was booked through the convention to receive the convention ""rate"" with taxes went over 2 Bills a night.  So, within striking distance of the Wynn or a number of other better properties and almost 2X of the MGM Signature.

I do not see the value for that price point. There are dozens of better options than Caesars Palace.",3,0,0

The rooms are quite nice as well.

Here are my biggest gripes:  
- NO jaccuzzi in the pool area (they used to have several but they were removed)
- Pure Nightclub is quite weak.  The drinks are overpriced, the layout is terrible, sound reverberates like in a tin can and the crowd looks like they have never been to a club before.

I arrived in the morning and attempted to check-in.  It was well before 3pm so I wasn't expecting to be put in my room but I wanted to leave my bags with the bell desk at a minimum.  I was booked into the Forum Tower which isn't the newest tower but it is remodeled.  It was the tower that was built in the 80's if I'm remembering right.

Like I expected the room wasn't ready, but I was told they would call my cellphone when it was ready.  It came around 2:30 and I hadn't gotten a call so I checked and the room was already ready.  I don't mind this but if you're not going to call, just tell me 3pm.  Don't let me find out later that the room is already ready and you haven't called.

The room itself was nice, I was at the end of the hall on floor 59, which i believe was floor 9.  I had a room that faced the strip, although on floor 59 you're looking more at the top of the Colosseum than the strip.  Like they said, it was remodeled recently.  There was a 40ish inch flat panel on the wall, 2 cordless phones, king size bed, a chase lounge and overstuffed chair.  The bathroom was also nicely done.  There was a over sized shower stall, a separate water closet for the toilet, and a 15in TV mounted in the mirror.  They also furnished two robes and had a safe in the closet.

If I was gambling only or wanted the shop at the Forum I wouldn't mind staying here.  For a convention its hectic, I would have preferred something in City Center like Mandarin or Vdara which are calmer to say the least.  The Convention space is just awkward to access and requires wondering through the expansive casino and back hallways of shops.  Its clear that access to the convention space access was not part of the original focus of the resort.

Aside from the hiccups with check-in, the service was top notch.  I needed a new iron and they brought one to the room within 15 mins.  The checkout process was easy and could be done from the room, the front desk or the guys with Ipads in the front desk area.

I personally wouldn't stay here on my own personal trips to Las Vegas.  I think there are newer equally priced places that aren't such a cluster.  Having said that, they provided a good product (Forum Tower or newer) and good service.  If you want the crazy hectic Vegas experience and a good strip location, stay at Caesar's.",2,0,0

The poker room after renovations is small and filled with unprofessionally behaved dealers, odd rules, and idiotic managers.

Valet was great and had better information on tickets to shows than the concierge. The Total Rewards players club has limited hours, even on busy nights.

Even though we were bounced around for hours from different departments to make this trip happen, the experience on the phone and through emails were amazing.

When we checked in, our two hotel rooms that we booked were horrible - beautiful view of the roof of another building with smoke coming out of it in the Forum towers. I called and asked the front desk to change our rooms with a better view; unfortunately, they asked me to go back downstairs and wait in the 30+ minute line. Where were the notes that we were celebrating our engagement?! So, even after our flight was delayed five hours and I was exhausted, I went back downstairs to change our rooms.

I was very fortunate and lucky to get Lisa L. To assist with the change of rooms with her supervisor. Lisa was SUPER HELPFUL, so sweet, and accommodating - she did everything she could to offer us better rooms with the pool view in the palace towers. She made our trip so much more enjoyable. The ONLY reason I'd come back to Caesar's Palace would be because of Lisa L. 

When we checked out this morning, I noticed our emailed bill\/receipt that said we had been changed for the resort fee for two nights for two rooms, which initially they said they'd waive that on the phone call due to our Veteran's status. I went over to the front desk and asked about this, but the supervisor named Theary stated that they don't offer waivers for Veteran's status even though a Caesar's palace employee told me over the phone. 

We kept going back and forth, and she wouldn't come up with any solution other than telling me that there's nothing she can do and I was mistakenly told that, and would have to get a phone number to track the call. I booked our trip through my work, which is a blocked number so she said that my phone calls cannot be traced, which means: 1). She won't waive the measly resort fees, 2). She's right; not the customer because that's Caesar's Palace mentality of good service, and 3). She didn't care for our satisfaction; just hers (we felt so bad the poor, young man in training standing awkwardly next to her). 

Next time, I'll make sure that I call from an unblocked phone and write down everyone's names so Theary can complete her investigation in order to waive the resort fees (that's what she requested and made a scene about at the front desk) - how ridiculous! I don't even care about the resort fees at all at that point - it was her horrendous attitude, rude personality, and unhelpful service that I'm so upset about. How can Caesar's Palace call this hospitality?! 

I don't know anyone in her position of leadership who would ever raise her voice and speak to any upset customer like this! It was very, very rude and extremely horrible customer service. I will be sure to tell all my family and friends to NEVER celebrate anything special at Caesar's Palace due to the lack of service offered at the front desk by Theary. Everyone else seemed super nice and helpful except for the Theary - that's really unfortunate since employees learn emotional intelligence and good service from their supervisors. 

I even read an article on Forbes regarding managers teaching their employees great customer service at Caesar's Palace - where was Theary's manager in all this disservice to the public?! Not there to help! I'll be sure to tell every single friend and family member of mine (who always ask for my travel recommendations) to never stay at Caesar's due to my terrible experience with Theary. Never again!!!",2,1,1

The VIP check in clerk was completely incompetent. When he looked up my reservation he asked me if i knew how much the rates were even though i had already paid the first night, frankly insulting. He gave us a smoking floor room when my wife has bad asthma and I had requested a non smoking room. He never took my credit card information when I handed it to him at check in, and was woke up at 7:30am to put a credit card down. Food Court was slow and serves cold food.

It was so spacious, comfortable, and luxurious to have so much room and it was decorated so nicely. I was really happy with our room. It made me want to just lounge inside. 

The only reason I'm not giving Caesar's another star is, it was incredibly difficult to get the free slotplay advertised. First, I signed up for Total Rewards and was told when I checked-in at the front desk to ask for the required $10 coupon. At the front desk, I was told they had run out of coupons and didn't know when they would get another shipment in. 

After I checked out, I went to Total Rewards and told them the front desk had run out  of coupons and could they just look me up in the system. The Total Rewards person told me I had to be still checked in to get the free slotplay. In the end, I didn't get it. I was given the run-around.

Initial impression was that the rooms were a bit larger than other hotel rooms that we've stayed at in Las Vegas. The rooms had a nice decor and were very comfortable. The bathrooms were huge and had a shower and jet tub bath tub. The walls however are very thin and you can hear everything your neighbors are doing. We had a kid running back and forth in the early morning hours and what seemed like all day. We had an adjoining room and we could hear our neighbors talking, their kids screaming and their toilet seat flipping up and down. On the other side of us, we could hear our neighbors TV on all night even though our TV was on too. May as well have no walls at all. 

The Octavius Tower is far from the casino. It's a good 5 to 10 minute walk. The upside is that there's no cigarette smoke around and the non smoking rooms don't wreak like casino. The worst is that it's a good 15 minute walk from your room to the self parking lot. If you left something in the car just leave it. It's at least a 30 minute round trip walk to go get it. 

We saw the Shania Twain show. Overall a good, entertaining show. The theatre is nice but the production was a little cheesy. Shania was good though. 

Food options are nice. Great BBQ at the food court and the French onion soup at the Central restaurant was good. This is a 24 hour restaurant. We attempted to have lunch at Serendipity III but had to leave. They had the heat blasting inside so we asked to sit outside but was told they aren't seating outside. It was a chilly day and they have warmers in the outside seating so I don't understand. Inside was crowded and really hot\/uncomfortable. We left and ate at the food court. 

I doubt I will stay here again. It's way too pricey for what it is. For a 5 star hotel, I had high expectations. It was just okay for me. The rooms and accommodations are probably some of the best in Vegas but considering the thin walls with noisy neighbors, I'll be looking elsewhere for a good night sleep. Glad I experienced it.

First off, we were lucky enough to have Nayel help us with our super early check-in at 10 am, which I might add, only cost us an extra $30! That was awesome. What was even more awesome was that she gave us a free upgrade from the Roman Towers to a luxury room in the Augustus Towers. Score! Sure, there were two beds and it was smoking - but that's fine with us since it was such an amazing upgrade! When we stay at Caesar's Palace next time, we are definitely going to look for her to help us again.

In addition, the room was gigantic, with both a large tub with jets, as well as a separate shower. The beds were spacious and comfortable. We were warned about the motion censors on the food and beverages in the room, but one of the items had already been opened and moved. We let them know about this at the end of our stay, and they didn't charge us. Everything was spotless and neat. We had a great view of the strip from our side room on the 25th floor.

This was the second stop for our itinerary. Once we got in the Omnia, my cousin Kizzy Fosten who is legally blind needed to use the ladies room. Her friend Angela assisted her to the restroom because she needed someone to guide her to the restroom. Kizzy had on a jumper so it needed to be unzipped from the back(mind you she can't see;legally blind). I waited by the restroom door for Kizzy and her friend Angela to come out so we can enjoy the rest of my birthday trip. Kizzy flew from Chicago, I flew from Dallas and Angela drove from Arizona. After I noticed the ESV attendant come rushing out of the restroom to get security. I immediately went in to check on my cousin. There I saw the attendant beating on the door like she was FBI or some kind of law enforcement. I stopped her and asked what was wrong. She ignored me and continued to beat again on the door. By that time, two men security came rushing in and asking what was the problem. I tried to explain that my cousin is legally blind and she needed help in the restroom. One of the officers asked me to come out of the restroom but I told him that I needed to help my cousin walk out of the restroom with me as well. After that Morgan,(security supervisor) then approached Kizzy, Angela and myself, he stated that he needed to talk with us outside. We cooperated with him and proceeded out back where other officers followed. By that time we were totally embarrassed, upset and confused of what has happened. After requesting the ESV attendant name, her supervisor name we were declined any information. After completely explaining the situation to Morgan, the situation wasn't handled properly. The attendant mistakenly thought my cousin was intoxicated but couldn't walk alone to do anything. One of the officers asked was she intoxicated or something else was wrong with her and I replied, yes she's legally blind. His answer to me was she doesn't look blind to me. By this time I was livid and wanted something to be done about this at this particular point. Morgan insisted that I had an attitude but again its how the situation was handled so I had to stand my grounds. Morgan even said to me you better be lucky I am in this uniform and I'm a changed man. I responded back, what are you getting at because I'm not going to back down from you at all. After the going back and forth, Morgan declined for us to gain access to the club again. I asked Morgan to call for us a Uber to pick us up and take us back to the hotel that we were staying at(Tropicana). Morgan answer was for us to walk back to the hotel in which was 2 miles away. Morgan walked us back in the casino where he told us to have a seat. We thought he was going to get the attendant's supervisor but we sat there 20 mins waiting and nothing. I then said, I needed to express my concerns to someone else because this isn't right. Working in a night or casino atmosphere, there should be more training in these areas like TAP. Once I walked over to the restroom and requested an ESV supervisor, I talked with Teresa and she was very helpful. Teresa walked us over to the security podium and we spoke with Melinda(supervisor)and she was extremely helpful. After we expressed our concerns with her, she walked us to the front so we can catch the Uber that was waiting on us. I will never return to the facility and wouldn't recommend this place.

I get an email to pre check in, so I do. I notice the connector email confirmation now says connector King (we have 5 grown women for this suite). I go back to my original confirmation and it says clearly connector QQ. I call. here the nightmare begins. Im on hold 30min, then 30min then 30min and so to finally be told they don't have my room. Well they have it but it is held for a 7 star quest. Nothing I can do this late. Leaving me with zero options. its a busy weekend in vegas. I booked out back in August. Can NOT believe the horrible customer service. Seems they decided I am no-one once I do not track my points here to be their 7 star customer, and so taking away the room I booked they are ok with the causality. What a way to ruin someones 40Th birthday. I still have no idea what we are going to do as I am typing and I am so upset. Who does this? I hope their 7 star guest is worth ruing a birthday trip. I have gals flying in and am in disbelief.

Just got off the phone with the 'Manager' who says she believes we will have our room we booked, she acted as though she was doing me the favor not that they had made an error and are ruining our trip before it even starts.  Apparently even through I have an email for the suite with conector room clearly starting 2 Queen beds this is NOT a guarantee.  This is a suite and clearly starts the beds.  I wouldn't have booked this otherwise, we have 5 grown women, no way would I have booked thinking we could end up with one bed in the connector room versus the 2 beds.  

BEWARE- apparently if you ever travel with someone and want to share a room and think you are booking 2 beds you could end up with one bed.  No where else does this.  When i travel with my kids and need 2 queens I book and pay for 2 queens, it's not a guessing game of what I will end up with.

At the very end, she says 'we figured it out and have the room you need, (that I BOOKED!!! IN AUGUST!!) but no guarantee, it's pretty sure but not for sure, but have a safe travels and don't worry'  I explain kindly as I can, do you realize what you are saying?  So I am suppose to go all day not knowing if we have a place to properly sleep or not?  even though my confirmations in AUGUST say we have exactly what I 'need' and what I booked?

It was my first trip to Vegas ...I had trouble experience 
First I made reservation through Hotels.com and requested 2 connected rooms since my mom on wheelchair .
The receptionist was so rude and was yawning all the time. He checked me in and gave me the keys for my room and told me"" sorry since you made reservation through third party we cannot honored your request and there is nothing we can do to help!!! Really!!
I got room at the 10th floor and my mom at the 15th floor which been such a hassle for her.
Got to the room and even though we claimed my son through our reservation there was no bed for him so I had to call to request a bed. After 15 min there was no bed ...my husband called again and after 30 no bed I have been told I can leave the room and when we are back the bed should be there.
I got back to the room after 2 hours and still NO BED!!!

At the check out  I have been asked if my visit was pleasant and I informed them that it was horrible all I got SORRY !

PROs - Location is awesome. Hotel is very nice. We stayed at the Augustus Tower and we had a great view of the strip. Our room is freaking huge and I love the bathroom (his and hers sink, whirlpool tub, huge shower). The pool is great too. I also love that it's connected to the Forum Shops. My bank account definitely suffered a bit because of that. 

CONs - We stayed there for 5 days and the chambermaid only cleaned our room ONCE. What was that about? For the money we're paying, I was expecting the room to be cleaned EVERY SINGLE DAY. Of course, I did not leave a tip. For what?

The pool can get crazy and I hate that people who are not staying at the hotel can access the pool for a fee. They're so rowdy and obnoxious too. Oh and the drinks? $12 bucks for a daiquiri mix coming out of a slushy machine? I know this is Vegas but really? 12 bucks?

Gambling: Better than hotel room cleanliness.

I've been told this place is better than a lot of the other options on the strip... Unfortunately I'm just not seeing it.

Lets say you have about two hundred bucks in your pocket. Your buddy does as well. You live in California too. You feel spontanious and decide to go to Vegas. 

Well here is what to do. Fill up the tank. Also bring a bag of nice clothes. Then make sure once you get to Vegas fill up the gas tank again. Then go to the top floor of Caesars palace parking lot and park the ride. You could change in the parking lot if you want or you could go to a local 24 hour fitness if you have a membership and change there. 

Then once your there you can club hop, gamble , eat , play cards, hook up. But, be careful there are alot of hotties who are really hookers. You could waste your time thinking your gaming when really it is just a hooker. They happen to be drop dead gorgeous too. So I would talk to the girls with slight flaws. The ones that look perfect are probably hookers. Easy way to spot them is if they happen to be talking to an old dude with money. Drinks alone can cost you 100 bucks for the whole night per person. Save like twenty to thirty to get into the club that seems to be popping the most. The clubs in Vegas are far nicer than Californias. Also far more expensive. But, the good times are rolling all around the place. Obviously if you have never been to Vegas you have to go at least once in your life.

When we arrived we were informed that our room was not yet ready and that we would have to wait 1-2 hours.  The front desk staff member informed us that the only comparable room available was a double queen non-smoking.  There are several reasons I wouldn't have considered this a ""comparable"" room.  Namely, a second bed is rather useless for a guest party of two individuals, the beds were smaller than the one I had actually booked, and the bathroom configuration for the double queen did not include the separate spa tub which was included in my originally booked room.  At no point did the front desk member offer any form of consolation (e.g., drinks, food, casino credits, late checkout, extended stay), nothing.  When I asked if it would be possible to be placed in the queen room and be moved when the king was ready, I was denied.  

After flying in and spending a long day lugging our luggage around the strip, waiting for check-in time, we were essentially being told that we couldn't have what we had paid for and if we didn't like it, oh well.  

My wife and I decided to take the queen room in lieu of waiting the additional 1-2 hours.  I spoke with the front desk later and requested a late check-out but I was initially denied until I explained the situation my wife and I had experienced at check-in.
 

I am extremely dissatisfied with the truly minimal effort the staff put forth with regard to resolving this problem.  This was my first trip to Las Vegas and I had insisted to my wife, who has been to Vegas multiple times, that we stay at Caesar's because it was, to me, synonymous with Las Vegas.

Staff: Friendly & more than happy to answer all of  your questions. Great attitudes! Lisa was especially helpful for so if you need assistance\/special requests, look for her if you can (curly brown hair).

The swimming pools of Caesar's Palace. There were so many pools with a massive one in the middle. Beware: the Pina Colada costs 11 bucks. no exaggeration, no lie. 

the hotel is in a nice spot relative to the Strip. Close to a lot of big hotels. i just can't stress the beauty of this place enough. The front and the inside and the pools...Caesar's was absolutely beautiful. There's spas for you, dining.

I think what's impressive is the Forum Shops, shopping section (east wing) of Caesar's Palace. Holds probably about what? over 100 shops? 
Do keep in mind these stores are high-priced stores. There is an antique store , having like 1980s or 1990s or before 1960s and such posters with autographs. Pretty cool to look at. 

So if you don't mind pricy shopping, Forum Shops are the way to go.

First of all, let me just say I don't normally write reviews about any place that's good or bad. However, this is an exception because this has gone far enough. 

I frequent their SportsBook to watch games and place some wagers. Let's just say I see every part of the service sector that goes on in that place. 

YOU WON'T GET GOOD SERVICE UNLESS YOU ARE WHITE. 

Yes, that's absolutely correct. You will get profiled and you will be treated with a second class service. Everyday tourists who are not white do not know that it is being done on purpose. 

This includes Bartenders, servers, casino staff and even the representatives at the wager counter. I've seen this day in and day out. I personally have had profiling and bad service given to me many times by different people. 

Short Asian Bartender at the SportsBook bar is by far the worst. He has treated me with hostility. He proceeds to ask for my ID with an attitude even though he has served me before and I had a wagering free drink ticket. Note to everyone: you cannot wager unless you're 21 and above in order to receive a free drink ticket. I have explained this to him before even though he knew the procedure. Anyhow, he will serve a white person first before any other person of any race. I have witness this many times before. He is as arrogant as you can get towards people who are not white. I will get his name next time as I have not seen his name tag properly every time I had an encounter with him. 

No, I'm not white. I don't dress to impress (although, I dress well). I speak fluent English and born in America. I have money and education. I'm not racist nor am I prejudice. I have friends and family from different races and background ethnicities. 

These are based on my personal experiences and observations. This place only cares about a FORM of a person, not a SUBSTANCE the person has. 

This place needs a lot of training when it comes to accommodating people of different background.

The front desk wait time was 25 minutes and there was only two groups ahead of us.  When we got our turn we were told we were upgraded which was $50ish more per night which we were excited about as this was a trip to celebrate a couple things. This was our babymoon and my husbands birthday celebration.  We've always wanted to stay at Cesar's so we were super happy after we go to our room and saw how many relaxing options we had.  Double shower, jacuzzi bathtub and a spacious room.  

We finally got settled and in bed around 4am to be woken up at 7am with the sound of drilling, hammering and loud vibrating.  After trying to sleep through it a couple hours, we called the front desk to ask what was happening above us and the lady was very apologetic and advised us that we should've been notified at check-in and there should be a notification letter in our room about the construction on the floors above us.  Which neither of those had happened as we never would've paid additional to cut into our rest and relaxation as that is something vey important to us. It was frustrating that we paid for an upgrade but was never advised of the construction at all.  She then said she would waive our resort fee for the night and we could possibly move rooms on 6\/21 which would be our last night.   She then advised me to go to the front desk and speak with the manager to make those arrangements or discuss other options.  

I went to the front desk and the agent was very condescending and gave information that was opposite of what the previous agent gave.  She said ""I am surprised you can hear the construction it's no where near you.  It's nearly 20 floors away.  It cannot be that loud where you are.""  I then said that regardless we were not notified and I just spoke with someone who gave information that contradicts that and the previous agent advised us to see the front desk manager less than 30 minutes ago and that we never would've paid more for something that would interrupt our rest.  She then responded that ""you got an exceptional deal on that room so you should be happy and that it normally is a $200 a night upgrade.""  Again she dismissed the request and said she would speak to her manager.  She disappeared for about 5 minutes and came back, no manager with her and said ""all we will do is move you to a non-upgraded room or we can waive the fee for two of the three nights.""  I said I would like to discuss it with my husband but he's trying to rest so I would be back with our decision and she became very short with me and said ""you should call him, you don't want to save $100?""  At this point I now knew customer satisfaction was not the priority and accepted the $100 offer.  It was never about the money it was about the lack of sincerity and absolute dishonesty and disrespectful tone she used towards me.  

This experience is enough for us to avoid Cesar's in the future and not recommend it to anyone as the least we expect is respectful behavior from the staff as we are respectful people.  Additionally, the construction started everyday 7am on the dot so we're leaving Vegas more exhausted than when we arrived.",2,0,1

The key cards would de activate every time we used it. Each and every time we returned to our room we had get new keys. Not only was this an Inconvenience, it was really time consuming.

Pros: 
Pool
Nice big jet tub in rooms
Ya that's it for the pros

Cons:
Extremely tight machines.   I went with a group and we felt fortunate to get $30 wins.  Seriously nobody was winning anything.

They need more cocktail waitresses.   At one point I played for 2 hours without being offered a beverage.  I called an attendant to find one and he couldn't and told me about his frustrations with their crappy service, and how the waitresses are never around.  We finally went to the bar and paid for one.

The room decor was average.  Bathrooms were really nice though

didn't really like the food choices

The upkeep just really has taken a nose dive here. The desk employees are down trodden and everything is still over priced. 

The cocktail waitresses are still sweet as pie and it's still one of the only places I win in Vegas but I feel like the lights flicker now...?

They also charge you up the wahoo for every little thing. The drinks in the minibar are more expensive than having the same exact thing delivered from room service- what?!
We paid to get the upgrade to room with an view and an en suite Jacuzzi but realized the view was of the side of the strip and the en suite jacuzzi was a bath tub. 

We ordered two salads and two OJs from room service for breakfast and the bill after tip was $80. Again-- what?!?

Service - 2 stars.  Checking in and out of the hotel were very pleasant experiences. Everyone was courteous and happy to show us around. The problem was when I sought out a member of the pool staff when I realized the pool water had turned my white swimsuit greenish. I explained to her all I wanted was for the hotel to try to clean the suit and they were unwilling to do anything to help. She agreed the suit was discolored but insinuated maybe it was my own fault. 

Rooms - 3 stars. We stayed in the Palace Tower in a deluxe room and it was just an average hotel room. The bathroom was fantastic but the actual room itself looked very old and the sheet cover looked dirty.

Other amenities - 4 stars. Loved the Forum shops and the variety of restaurants within the hotel. I will definitely come back for the shopping and to dine at Nobu.

+ Cool fountains and decor

- Got moved, but to a smaller room
- Reception\/Front Desk takes a WHILE to pick up
- Housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day
- There was calcium buildup on one of the sinks

- There was a CD player in our room, but no ipod hookup (I know this is minor, but who brings CDs with them to a hotel in Vegas?!)
- Bell hop services charge $20 for a full cart, or $5 per box\/piece for the convention center (a little steep for someone who is staying there)

I've stayed at many of the hotels on the Las Vegas strip, and finally decided to give Caesars Palace a try for one night during the week. I got a great deal through Priceline Express deals and was pleased with my 24 hour experience there. To be honest, I mostly chose Caesars Palace for the pool. The TripAdvisor photos did not lie... the main guest pool is as grand, spacious and luxurious as I expected it to be! I felt as if I had landed at a grand palace in Europe! To my surprise, the poolside seating was hard to come by, both in the morning at 10am and afternoon around 3pm. You can easily rent a poolside cabana or lounge chair, however, the 'free' chairs fill up quickly! Apparently Caesars has 7 pools onsite, some of which may charge a fee for entry or lounge chair. I was perfectly happy with the 'common' pool, which is my main draw to come back in the future.

We stayed in a room in the Forum Tower, which appears to be the cheapest due to it's location and rooms. The Forum tower is closest to the Forum shops, which is a few minute walk from the main valet and lobby. However, if you decide to self park, the Forum Tower entrance is right next to self parking.

We were upgraded to a Junior Suite in the Palace Tower and enjoyed our view of the strip and Bellagio water show (the view between the Augustus Tower and Bellagio) as well as our view of the pools, including the new 'hotel guest exclusive pool'.

Our room was 900 square feet, had a huge closet, two bathrooms, very very comfy king sized bed and a decent sized sitting area.  The bathroom was the best - There was one large shower with two showerheads that you could enter from either bathroom.  The jacuzzi tub was large enough for two and so nice to have in the room.

I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the bed was.  I slept so well.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful and pleasant - Andrew at the front desk is wonderful.  Our housekeeping staff was very thorough and friendly when we saw them in the hallway.  

I like the location of Caesar's Palace, it's somewhat central to the hotels on that side of the strip (next door to Bellagio and Mirage, across the street from Harrah's, near TI and Venetian).

We also explored the new Augustus Tower and the conference room area.  We even passed a couple of the 'chapels' - I was always kind of curious what they looked like for whatever reason.  They weren't all that exciting to look at, to be honest, but I can see how they had potential to be 'done up' a bit if the wedding party decided to do any decorating - just adding flowers would probably make it look like a funeral parlor.... I definitely want to check out Qua Day Spa on a future visit if we stay at Caesar's again.

While I like Caesars Palace as a whole, easy access to the Forum Shops in particular, it's definitely not my favorite overall hotel.  I still have an affinity for the Venetian.  We weren't really intrigued by any of the restaurants in Caesars, with the exception of 808, but we were dazzled by our other dining options at the other hotels and decided to skip it this visit.

I posted everything I wanted on Twitter, YouTube, TripAdvisor, and Yelp of my experience at Caesars Palace before uploading this review.

The first time I ever stayed at Caesars Palace was in 2011 to watch Pacquiao-Marquez III. My friend and I stayed at the Roman Tower for 3 nights where we each paid $73 a night. During that time I enrolled in the Total Rewards Program. I had a great time at Caesars Palace. My boss stated I got the deal of the century because I paid $73. Due to that affordable price I wasn't sure if I was going to stay at Caesars Palace again. 

Last year in August was Caesars Palace 50th Anniversary. In honor of that anniversary Caesars Palace presented the ""IAmCaesar"" Sweepstakes. There were 4 package prizes: Emperor, Nightlife, Indulgence, and Culinary. Each sweepstakes package prize was different but you get free nights to stay at Caesars Palace along with spending credits for food and spa. I entered the Indulgence Sweepstakes. The winner of that sweepstakes would get 3 free nights, free airfare, limo ride, $600 dining credit, $600 spa credit, and VIP ticket to the Colosseum headliner. As a Total Rewards Member I entered the contest through Total Rewards last September. When I entered the sweepstakes I didn't think I would win. How often do you win sweepstakes prizes? Last December I received an email from Herbie Pallotta of Caesars Entertainment stating that I won the Indulgence Sweepstakes. I thought the email was a scam but I remember entering that contest. I was shocked and elated. Attached on the email was an affidavit that the prize was approximately worth $4,550, which according to IRS regulations is taxable income. I had a list of questions to ask him. Once he assured me of my concerns I accepted the prize. Thanks Herbie for all your help. Besides Herbie Pallotta I also want to thank Lesa Campbell, Director of Marketing at Caesars Entertainment, who answered my questions and scheduled my itinerary during my stay at Caesars Palace.

So how was my experience of getting free airfare, limo ride, spa credit, dining credit, and showcase? The experience exceeded my expectations - the best Vegas vacation I ever had. Originally I was going to get a room at the Julius Tower, which was the original Roman Tower, as it was recently renovated. I looked at the website and noticed that the Julius Tower rooms were really small but I couldn't complain as I was getting a free room at Caesars Palace. However when I checked-in I was able to get a room at the Augustus Tower, which had been renovated this year, with a view. My goodness from my room I could see the Fountains of Bellagio, Eiffel Tower, and The Strip. 

Throughout my stay at Caesars Palace I felt I was Caesar. Using the $600 spa credit to get a haircut at COLOR Salon by Michael Boychuck and deep tissue body massage at Qua Baths and Spa made me pampered. Comping $600 dining credit for free dinners at Rao's, Mesa Grill, and Old Homestead Steakhouse made me feel I was a celebrity. Getting a free ticket that costs $250 to watch Mariah Carey felt as if I was a rock star. Riding in a limo from the airport to Caesars Palace felt as if I was an aristocratic Roman on a chariot in Ancient Rome.

The three areas that a hotel casino are judged are gambling, lodging, and dining. Caesars Palace hits all three areas with its Ancient Roman theme. It's not hard to see why Caesars Palace lasted 50 years and could last another 50 years. Not everything at Caesars Palace will be 5 stars but as a whole Caesars Palace is 5 stars in my book especially since I stayed there for 3 free nights with all the perks. I couldn't do everything while I was there. There's so much stuff to do at Caesars Palace. In the future if I visit Caesars Palace I want to walk in the Forum Shops, dine at Restaurant Guy Savoy, and gamble at the slots or crap tables. I didn't gamble that much at all during my stay at Caesars Palace. Originally I was going to play $50 in honor of the anniversary but I ended up only betting $20 at the slots and winning $38. There's a saying about betting: ""Go big or go home."" Since everything was free why ruin a trip by losing $500 or more at the slots or table?

In 2014 twice I was comped at Vegas for two hotels: Bally's and Harrah's. Each time I had 4 free nights. In addition I had $25 dining credit, which I could only use once. I thought back then that was special. However staying at Caesars Palace for free with all the free perks ""beats the cake"". I don't know when I will go back to Vegas, but I do know that most likely I won't be staying at Caesars Palace. Why? What's the likelihood of getting a free stay at Caesars Palace again? I don't want to ruin my cherished experience of my free stay at Caesars Palace by paying to stay at Caesars Palace. If I get an opportunity for a free stay at Caesars Palace I will not hesitate to come back to Caesars Palace. Happy 50th Birthday CP LV!",15,9,14

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy ""Nobu"" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive ""Laurel"" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current ""it"" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if ""it"" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the ""Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive"" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.",38,27,34

I booked an Premium Room with a King Bed online weeks prior to driving out to Vegas and Caesars sent me an email saying they would send me another email the day of our arrival which would allow us to check in online and an email would be sent when our room was ready.  Sure enough I received the email Thanksgiving morning and was checked into our room in a flash.  A short time later, I received an email confirmation stating our room was ready.

Upon our arrival in Las Vegas ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=Wmmr4X9Vll6_NbaihAk_Rg ), the car was valeted (free), we went to Keys & Mail and picked up our two room keys and our room assignment.  The room itself was nice, but the mattress was a bed of marshmallows and was completely unacceptable for a supposed upgraded room.  I will cut through all the exchanges over the next hour and the Guest Services manager finally agreed to moved us into a Palace Petite Suite (a down grade, not an upgrade), removed the resort fees for the two days and made it seem like she was doing us a favor.  

Rohlinism:  A down grade should never be presented as a favor.

I know every hotels keep x amount of upgraded rooms for emergencies, but I guess our issue didn't qualify!  The right thing would have been to move us to an upgraded room and it would have gone a long way to defusing the situation.

She also told us she would call \/ text us when the room was ready and would ensure our bags would be moved to the new room.  We were already behind schedule, so we took the manager at her word and headed off for our afternoon at Secret Garden.  

I never received call or text regarding our new room the whole afternoon.  We went back to Keys & Mail and inquired about our new room.  The room was ready, but our luggage was never moved.  Et tu Guest Services?!  Et tu?!  After more arguments (and a threat of checking out), we were given a $50.00 food voucher attached to our room.  We probably would have checked out at this point, but the odds of finding a room at another hotel for two nights was unlikely and we had non-refundable tickets Friday night, so we were stuck!

Our new room ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=9hUWNft-SB7mM8NwdJ2FtA ) was more dated than the original.  One of the sinks was clogged (cleared the next day) in the bathroom ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=BUSvs621UoZyJAsMatNtXQ ) and the bathtub drained very slowly, but the wife said spa tub was very comfortable.  The water pressure in the shower was very good and the shower was roomy.  

Other than the bed being slightly firmer (didn't sleep well), the view ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=1CrcaArTK4LVvK_Ee65PpQ ) was better than the original room and the television was larger than the flat screen in the original room (very odd).

The décor is still impressive with the numerous statues and fountains throughout the property:

( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=r7W-7VHv2tFqMGlyg4DXUw )

When we checked out on Saturday morning the promised deductions were on the final bill as well as a charge of $33.60 for the early check in.  We immediately asked for a manager for two reasons:

1.  There was no mention of this charge during any of the emails I received regarding early check in.

2.  We didn't actually get into the room we stayed until 5:00 pm which is hardly an ""early check in.""

We finally had the early check in fee removed from the bill, but I felt getting these concessions was like battling in the Circus Maximus instead of actually wanting to make things right.  This debacle came close to ruining the whole trip and I felt it was massive waste of money for people that don't have any money to burn. 

I have been coming to Las Vegas for 30 plus years and I can remember the first time I walked into Caesars Palace and hoped I could afford to stay here one day.  Caesars was once the ""gold standard"" for luxury hotels in Las Vegas and like the once great Roman Empire, it has faded into history.

I will never stay here again and will avoid Caesars Entertainment properties in future visits to Las Vegas.  If Julius Caesar ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=sh4wgW7iE28iXo5KhXOvug ) were still alive, he would probably treat the governing body of this corporation the same way he treated Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus.",170,150,155

In a city where everything is larger than life, Caesar's Palace is probably the king. This is something to think about when booking - because getting from point A to point B in this palace-place is going to eat up your time.

In terms of the standard services - guest check-in\/out, bell staff, housekeeping, spa, taxi line, doormen, you'll be dealing with some very nice people and experience attentive service - and for this excellence - the star rating of this hotel is warranted. But remember - this is a massive hotel - that often appears understaffed - so sometimes your wait for this excellent service is going to be a bit longer than you'd expect.. And - while the general staff was wonderful - a small brush with management over a water shut down (for seven hours - with no planned adjustment to the bill) - showed management to be unpleasant, aloof, and disconnected from the guest experience. No stars for management.

The rooms themselves are great, if you're staying in the recently renovated Forum Tower. There, Caesar's Palace appears a five-star hotel. However, if you're in the Roman Tower expect the average-quality of a three-star hotel that has seen better days.

The best thing about this hotel was the Spa - which - while quite expensive - was worth the price and experience.

In other - wifi will run you about 15 bucks a day for service - but only in your room. If you want to access the hotel wifi from other areas of the property, you're looking at an additional fee.

Overall - while the stay was okay - the size of the hotel got to be cumbersome - and the inconsistency of value an annoyance.",6,0,0

Not only was I taken back by their amazing hotel room, but their entire Rome themed property surrounded with beautiful pools, tall marble columns and life-like statues.  I've been coming to this hotel for years, and the atmosphere never ceases to amaze me.

The property boasts tons of restaurants from gourmet to casual dining including restaurants from famous well-known name chefs such as Bobby Flay, Gordon Ramsay, and Nobu Matsuhisa along with more casual family dining such as The Cheesecake Factory and Planet Hollywood.

They also have lots of gaming space, including an immense Race and Sports Book area where you can bet on your teams or just follow the action on one of their oversized flat screens or LED board.

You could also dive into one of their five spacious, elegant pools, enjoy some relaxation in their spa, indulge in a drink or two at one of their bars or see their live performance show with the famous Celine Dion singing her greatest hits.

Another reason I enjoy staying at this hotel is for the shopping found in their Forum Shops.  You can pick up the finest apparel, jewelry and other gifts there from stores like Banana Republic, Bebe, Bath and Body Works, Christian Louboutin, Coach, H & M, MAC Cosmetics and Tiffany.

I stayed at Caesars in a Palace Tower room for three nights and was pretty disappointed with the dramatic degradation of services and facilities that has occurred.  

We initially were placed in the Roman Tower but upon seeing the room we happily agreed to pay an upgrade fee for the Palace Tower.  Caesars should decommission the Roman Tower immediately.  The hallway and rooms are in complete disrepair and the room is more depressing than a low budget motel room.  Honestly.  Even the employee who helped us move admitted that the Roman Tower was a ""really sad place to work"".

Palace Tower is much improved but still lacks a lot of the details that one should expect from a 300 plus per night room.  There was a two inch hole in the wall which was odd.  The sink wouldn't completely turn off.  The corners of the furniture and wallpaper had scratches and marks.  No bathrobes despite a jacuzzi tub.  The phone in the bathroom didn't work.  All around the room needed some TLC.  It lacked maintenance.

The room was bearable but just doesn't compare to similar priced options at the Venetian or Cosmo or Aria.  The hallway leading to the Palace Tower smelled like sewage about 75 percent of the time we walked back to the room.  It was really bad at night.  Really bad.

The worst part of the stay though was consistent bad service.  It's clear that most of the employees do not care.  Maybe they've been mistreated by the company or maybe they've just been around for too long.  In any event though we received attitude throughout the entire stay from from the belldesk to calling the operator and asking for more towels (which never came) to asking if the mini bar items could be removed (13 dollars for pretzels or M and Ms.. Really?) to even the sports book woman taking our bets, to the gym attendant which we were required to pay a 32 daily resort fee to gain access.  Everyone had an edge to them as if we had done something to upset them.  Instead of ""hi welcome to the fitness center may I ask your room number""... ""What is your name... Then convinced we didn't pay for the gym until checking for a few minutes.""  It's just a bad tone to have to deal with while on vacation.  
And that's when you could even get through to someone. It was Laughable after a while. 

Try calling any of the service options on the phone and you might wait over five minutes to talk to someone.  45 minute check in line.  When asking for a manager they told me one isn't on duty at 2pm on a weekend.  Really. 

The place just isn't what it once was.  It is catering to the masses, lacks maintenance  and isn't staffed for the 4000 rooms they've built over the years.  

Caesars is a stationary cruise ship trying to nickel and dime you every which way they can for bad service and an average product.

Had very nice stay at their forum tower suite this time.  We were there for 6 nights 7 days.  This is the third time we stayed in this grand hotel, and I felt I owe this hotel a nice review. 

We only stayed at the Augustus Tower before,  but this time I wanted a bigger room.  So its between the view of the water show and the roomy suite. There are pros and cons about staying in this tower.

Pros:

Closer to everything, it's basically in the middle of the hotel.

Very spacious suite big enough to have a party

The suite has very good amenities with neat little convenient features like the curtain control panels for all the windows, privacy button, TV embedded in the bathroom mirror, etc.

Hugh walk-in closet with a safe. 

Nice tub in the suite bathroom.

The shower has four different shower head targeting at different area of the body.  Kind of useless in my opinion, but it could be a very nice feature for someone else.

Good house keeping service and room service.

The peeves.

It has no microwave!  The main reason I wanted a suite was to have a microwave, so I can warm up my coffee and tea, etc., Although there is a k-cup machine for coffee, but u can't use it to warm up stuff.  I've never stayed at a suite where there was no microwave.  It use to be $10 to rent one from the hotel when we stayed at the other tower, but they discontinued this service as of last month. 

Loud A\/C, sounded like someone was taking shower in the neighboring room but it turns out it was the A\/C.  I didn't get good sleep for the first few nights due to that.

Outdated depressing elevator, slow moving and old decor.   Elevator affects people's mood especially if u just lost ur money in the casino.  

Depending on which room u get, some rooms have the view of Rio and parking lot, but no view for the Bellagio fountain show.",3,0,0

Caesars Palace was my all time favorite, and, when I visited on business, I stayed in your less expensive hotels. Now, you have lost all the class and dignity that made your organization great. First, you acquiesced to the anti-player rule changes, in blackjack, that were present, only, in the low-class casinos. (My average bet was $100-$200, before the rule changes. Now, it's $10-$40.) Then, when I visited Caesars Palace, last year, I found that my room was ready, but I needed to fork over another $20, if I wanted access to it, a few hours before check-in time. No class. Then, you added the resort fees. What a scam. Even when I'm comped or given a good deal because of my player points, I still need to fork over another $35-$40 per night for services I never use. Now, you are starting to charge for parking. What a shame. I will spend $300 per night on a room, and you want to milk me for another 10 bucks? Again, NO CLASS.

The hotels are fine, but the management, with its classless tactics of penny-and-diming the guests is reprehensible. I'm afraid that my last visit to a Caesars hotel was, indeed, my last visit to a Caesars hotel, until the pricing and gaming policies change. It does no good to explain that your horrible policies are ""strip wide."" (A phrase that your staff seemed to have memorized.) Caesars used to be classier than the rest. Now, it's a sleezy, downtown con game.",4,0,0

The hotel, rooms, atmosphere, and everything about it is obviously incredible.

Their staff from management down to the housekeepers are so friendly, willing to help, and want you to have a stress free vacation.

Special shoutout to Keli in VIP Services (I think they call her 'little Keli' since there is another, male, Kelly) who made our entire trip! We had a bit longer than usual wait time for our room and she gave us regular updates and went completely out of her way to ensure everything went smoothly. Funnily enough, she also assisted me with check in a YEAR ago and remembered me when I checked in last week. Absolute rock star of an employee, every business needs associates like her!

We were comped a few rooms here and reversed a single King room non-smoking.  When we arrived, we were told they didn't have a king room that was non-smoking. I was told that the comped rooms just have to take what we could get and we were given the choice of a smoking king or a non-smoking double queen.  But we didn't let the fact they didn't actually reserve a room spoil our good time and took the double queen. 

The room was pretty standard for Vegas: Wildly overpriced minibar, missing do not disturb sign, and room service only mistakenly barged into our room once. That last one gave me a pretty scare.

On the plus side, Caesars has great water pressure, a central location on the strip and the absinthe show there is incredible. Unfortunately for them, I spent most of my time enjoying other casinos and restaurants that belonged to other hotels.

Their Total Rewards loyalty program can be used across multiple properties in different states. The perks can be very beneficial with discounts and complimentary rooms. There's also 8 swimming pools here!

Price range is about $200 weekdays to $400 on weekends. Forum Tower is older and Palace Tower has been renovated recently. The NOBU suites start at $500-$800 and up but I've never stayed in them so can't comment. 

The location is right in the middle of the strip, Bacchanal Buffet is the most pricy and benchmark of LV buffets. The food court has cheaper options like Earl of Sandwich and Smash burger. It's also located right next to Poker room and Sports book. 

I've stayed at most Caesars properties in Vegas and I only recommend 1-Caesars 2-Cromwell 3-Planet Hollywood. The only other one I might consider is The Linq because of the location and the fun atmosphere.

They also no longer provide robes in the rooms. We were told by VIP guest services that even the Villas no longer have guest robes.

The AC is always cranked full blast. Claiming to be green for tax purposes and cost cutting DOES NOT mean they are a green company, just 'green' when it's convenient to them. The amenities and cleanliness have seriously declined. In addition there seems to be a major disconnect between hotel amenities and casino hosts.

We chose to stay here during July 4th weekend over Aria,  Mandalay,  Bellagio etc. Mainly because they have an awesome firework show and we also enjoyed our last stay a few years ago. 
We booked a package including hotel+airfare+car via priceline. Arrived early and checked in around 10 AM. We did not expect to have room right away... but tried our luck anyway. The line at general check-in area is long but moving well. The front desk person, Mr. M checked us in who reminded me of ""soup nazzi"" on Seinfeld episode... said ""no"" to everything!  No, you can check in early; no, there is no room available to upgrade (even with extra fee); No, you won't get your room until 4 or 6 pm... to check in early ie. 3 PM, it will cost $30. No, you can't use the facility... we then asked the friendly lady directing traffic at front desk if we can use the pools while waiting for our room. She gave us the room card to show at the pool desk!
We came back at 3 PM and had different front desk staff.  Mr. Delano saved the day. We were able to upgrade to petite suite in Palace tower with pool view (with extra fee)!

The petite suite is 600 square feet, with Jack and Jill shower, individual toilet and vanities,  jacuzzi tub, plenty of storage, sofar and desk. The room is cleaned and beautiful. There is coffee maker in the room but no supply for coffee.  

There are many restaurants, food court with late dinning (pizza and taco places), cafe Americano opens 24 hours, buffet.  The only issue is that you do not get any preference for staying at Cesar Palace when trying to book for these restaurants. We actually booked via open table. 

Overall,  we enjoyed our stay here... but hesitate to enroll in their loyalty program nor give them 5 star rating mostly due to their mediocre customer service.",3,2,2

The hotel is huge, so expect to do some walking and exploring. There are multiple towers to the hotel some are closer to the casino, some to the pool, and some are closer to the meeting rooms,
This can help if you are staying for business, pleasure, or both. The Palace Tower elevators have direct access to the meeting halls and pools, whereas the newer Octavius and Augustus Towers are near the pools but is farthest from the meeting halls. The Forum Tower is closest to the Colusseum but has no direct access to the pool or meeting halls without having to go through the casino.
All that aside, the rooms are excellent. Comfortable beds and some of the best pillows I've put my head on. The showers are awesome (one of the things that I really think makes a hotel stand out) since most rooms have these dual head showers (over head rainfall and wide spray front showers). And the TV in the bathroom.
There are plenty of food options, including room service. I will say this, if you are a foodie or just want to eat a lot, make sure to visit the Bacchnal Buffet. it is rated #1 by USA Today for a reason. The food is great, you have hundreds of selections from different cuisines, just be sure to wait at times since the line to go in may be up to an hour or more to get seated, unless you have a Diamond or Seven Stars players card.  As a local, I feel its a little overrated, but its a must try just to say you did it.
Parking can be an issue, especially on the longer weekends during the summer or if there is a fight in town.  The self-parking may fill up and can be hard to find parking.  At times, even valet parking will become full and only Diamond or Seven Star cardholders may use the Valet.

Like most Las Vegas facilities, it is overpriced. But Caesars has a special fee that seems designed to deceive and defraud:

Caesars has a little tray on the top of a cabinet with nine items considered part of their mini bar, even though they do not need refrigeration and they're really just taking up prime surface space in your hotel room. The  two least expensive are small bottles of water costing  $7.97 each. Most of the other items, such as Cheese Crackers, cost $14.07. One item costs $30.27 (""Intimacy package""!).  

My mom looked at the high cost\/low value items, decided she had no intention of using them, and moved all the items six inches away to a small open shelf to gain more space for her conference and exhibition material. She didn't use any of it.   

Upon departure she noticed a $25 restocking fee -- no fee for use of any of the junk (because she didn't use any of it), just a $25 fee for someone to literally move the stuff a few inches. After the stuff that some people do in their hotel room that staff has to clean up that doesn't incur a special fee this was pretty incredible. The front desk person insisted that this fee was noted on the room card. So my mom asked to see the room card. This is what she saw: A list of items and their prices, printed in at least 14 pica size, and there at the very end, in tiny tiny type (less than 6 pica) was the notice about the restocking fee charge. The manager, Mr. Barrientos, insisted that he could not remove the fee and said it was because maybe these (unrefrigerated, sitting-out) items would spoil outside of the refrigerator (ummm yeah, okay -- they weren't in it to begin with) and even moving all the items six inches back to the restocking tray would incur the fee. In fact, based on these rules they'd charge the fee even if you moved the items INTO the refrigerator. Melanie, at the Caesars Billing department, stated that management insisted these fees be charged without exception. It's gotta be the only thing in Vegas ""without exception.""

So my mom concluded that the notice in tiny, tiny type, after the fee list, was meant to pay lip service to what is probably a legal requirement of prior notification, while actually deceiving the customer. 

So beware, if you choose to stay at any Caesars properties, get out your magnifying glass to read the tiny print in your room, and check your bill carefully before departure -- Caesars is going bankrupt and wants every bit of your money now, no matter what. Honestly, being completely implacable and marring the last taste of someone's vacation over $25 -- bad show and classless, Caesars. Booooo booooo booooo.",10,2,1

Thank God we did not actually stay here! We had a trade show at Caesars all week and had the worst service I have ever experienced, especially for how much money we spent. I am so happy we decided to stay almost next door at Treasure Island, they were great and cheap!
At Caesars, It seems like they hire people from off the street for their staff because no one knows where anything is and can not answer any questions or direct you to anyone that can.
Every time I picked up the phone to call for anything I was on hold for at least 5min before having to hold another 5min to speak to someone that could help with anything. The trade show was 5days and I do not know how many times I had to call to find where our luggage had been taken to or never getting items that we ordered and paid for. They lost our luggage for several hours and still charged us per bag for drop off. 
We absolutely dreaded coming back each day. The entire hotel reeks of smoke, and for a Vegas hotel to stand out like that, they have to really be bad. The absolute worst service EVER!

But they insisted they carried my ice chest for me. Whatever, I'd rather not wait for my luggage by if they really wanted to carry it, I wont stop them. Then as I was checking in they were hesitate to check me my reservation because I had a temporary ID. After waiting long enough minutes, they finally let me check out my room. When we finally got to the room, there was a guy that came to drop off the ice chest. Now this is my first night, I didnt know that I was supposed to give the bellhop a ticket, I just suspected he was going to drop it off. When he asked for the ticket, I just asked ""Oh, am I suppose to give it to you?"" and he replies with attitude with ""Yeah"" I cant emphasize it online, but it is definitely not a way to talk to your guests. Then we go downstairs to the casino, but it turns out they wont let me gamble or drink because of my temporary ID. I am of age, but they still wouldnt let me.

Funny isn't it?). When the honeymoon was supposed to begin, we were disappointed to find out that the showers didn't even have hot water.

With that night finished, we were going to leave (not sad to leave), and just used their express drop-off feature they have because their lines were long. When we called in later to complain they said we didn't even check out, and were going to charge us another night. They finally decided to check us out for that one night, and when I then complain about everything that happened, their customer service rep, Jose, only had sorry to say.

When I saw said merchandise last weekend in the Forum shops (i.e.: the mall at Caesars Palace), admitting that they ""get that a lot,"" I actually chuckled. The marketing for the resort is basically packaged nicely for the next decade for them.

Caesars Palace (for those who noticed, it's without the apostrophe) is one of the largest hotel\/resorts in the United States, if not THE largest (or constantly vying for it at least, depending on what your parameters are). Supposedly, the name of the resort doesn't contain the apostrophe because it's meant to be plural and inclusive (i.e.: this ""Palace"" is not exclusive to [Julius] Caesar, but to all who spend time and money here; i.e.: other ""Caesars"" like you, the patron (or ""patrician,"" if you'd like)). 

Its theme is Ancient Rome during the imperial era. The architecture is monumental and imitates the former grandeur of the Roman Empire. The Forum mall is actually aptly named and was the first mall that was enclosed, but made you feel like you were outside Ancient Rome (complete with atmospheric changes that cycle through periodically). Even now, it's among the top five most successful shopping malls in America. I remember when I was a child being very impressed with the Forum mall, and quite honestly, I still enjoy walking through here whenever I'm visiting Las Vegas. If only more malls could find a theme like that and stick with it consistently throughout the facility.

If you enter the Forum mall through Las Vegas Boulevard, you'll likely see the spiraling escalators. They're one of only a handful in the world, and if you don't know where the rest are, it doesn't matter. This is by far the most impressive presentation of it. Nearby, there's also those talking statues of the Gods of the Festival. If you haven't seen a presentation yet, you'll need to, just to be able to say you did. Though it's a bit cheesy now, it was pretty impressive to a small child when it first debuted many, many years ago (i.e.: me).

As of this writing, Celine Dion is currently the house act here at the Coliseum (again, aptly named for the performing art center at Caesars), and apparently, she's one of the biggest shows in Las Vegas. I haven't seen her show yet, though I did like that Titanic theme she sang back in 1997 for film. Reason enough to see an act, I suppose.

I only noticed ONE person who actually got into the Ancient Rome theme this weekend and wore a Roman toga. He could have been part of a stag or bachelor's party or whatnot, but that got me thinking that Caesars should promote more of their patrons and some staff members to don period attire if they got 'em. Roman Empire, cosplay and history buffs would probably get off on such a sight.

Just like the hotel itself, I think it's a monumental task to describe all the elements of the resort in one review. You really should just take a moment to browse the pictures here on Yelp to get an idea of the kinds of things you'll see at Caesars Palace if you've never been inside before. There's just way too much detail in the events, rooms, casino, retail, restaurants, clubs, etc. to accurately describe and stay under the character limit.

On a personal note, I have to mention that back in the summer of 2003 or 2004, I recall coming across Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson (the poker player) at the Pure nightclub here at Caesars while on a weekend trip with some college friends. I took a picture with him outside in the patio area and still have that picture here at my desk as I'm writing this review. I honestly, have never had any bad experiences with Caesars, and it seems that, despite not actually having stayed a night here, I find myself visiting the Palace basically every time I'm around town.

Hail Caesar!",10,5,6

The package included a Palace Tower room (at $200\/night). Knowing how much it costs probably (does) factor into my rating of the room. 

I attempted to get an upgrade at check-in, but for $50 extra a night, no thanks. Also, no non-smoking king rooms available, so husband and I got to squeeze into a double bed together, how fun! Haven't done that since college. 

Upon entering the room, husband immediately said, ""This is probably the worst room I've stayed in in a long time,"" if that tells you anything. It's not necessarily that the room was BAD, it wasn't, it was just dated. And for $200 a night, it's ridiculous, compared to the deals I can find in Vegas for that kind of dough. 

The television (maybe 22""..wtf) didn't work when we arrived, but a quick call to guest services and the tv was functioning again. Damn, I wanted a better room.

I was hoping for two queen beds since we were forced out of a king, but nope. Double beds it is. 

The room has two bathrooms essentially, connected by the shower. I thought it was cool at first. Then I realized how convenient it would have been to have double sinks next to each other. You see, we only brought one tube of toothpaste and face wash. I had to retrieve it from the other sink every time I need it. There's also a bidet in one of the bathrooms. I wonder who uses them? 

We had a half view of the pool and that was about it. Pretty disappointing. 

Overall, just not super impressive. I'm sure if we had been able to stay in one of the updated towers things would have been different. I wouldn't stay here on my own dime, that's for sure. 

I will say having the forum shops so close is convenient. I can appreciate having Sephora right downstairs, as well as a plethora of restaurants and other shops.",4,3,4

I just got back fm Vegas and we stayed in the Octavius tower again. We got 2 connecting rooms QQ and K and another QQ next door. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean. I wish the towels were softer and better quality. My only complaint about the room is I tried to order room service but couldn't find the binder where they usually put the menu. I think they should update their system where they let us order room service fm our tV.  The diamond registration was efficient but they didn't serve us champagne this time bc we checked in on a Sunday.   The diamond lounge was ok. I wish they serve more variety of ""hot food"" and have a better wine list.   
Octavius valet was efficient and not as hectic as the main valet. (They only valet for 7 stars players)

The rooms are beautifully decorated.  The bed is very comfortable.  My son loved the bed!  They even provided us a playcrib.  Caesar's Palace is my new favorite Vegas hotel.

The restaurant and food selection is excellent.  Happy to try Beijing 9 and Ramsey's Pub.  Only doubt I have is the buffet.  It's good food and good price.

A cup of coffee in any of their restaurants is $6. You can have a fridge in your room if you want to pay them $20 a day. In all honesty it really is not the nice upscale hotel it use to be. It all seems so run down and worn out. If you are paying full price for a room I really suggest taking your money and going elsewhere.

Ok, I have never paid a fee to check in early- esp by an hour! at any hotel. this seems unheard of ,but fine,  we'll wait and hang out with some friends in the casino.  

So at around 3pm, we come back, see if we could get our room - and we are told no, rooms arent ready- theyll call us within 40 minutes for our room key. An hour goes by- no call. we go back to check in at 4 PM, and NOPE theyre still cleaning the room. 

It wouldnt be so bad if we didnt see the crowds of other hotel guests being given key cards and directions to their room. but seriously?

For the buffet we waited for an hour and the food was not really good. The food selection was not great. There is a ice cream area where you can order ice-cream but the lady behind the counter who was scooping the ice-cream put the ice-cream metal bucket on top of another ice-cream bucket (so that the bottom of the bucket was inside another ice-cream.. very unsanitary).

Finally a cocktail waitress walked passed by.  He pit boss waved her down. She did not want to serve the people sitting at the tables. She still stood there and argued with the pit boss and said this is not my section I have to grab the server for this section.

Been to plenty of casinos such ass Tunica Mississippi & Metropolis Illinois there Diamond lounge is way better. They treat all of their Diamond and Seven Star players with class. Unlike Caesar's Palace.",2,2,1

In an effort to get some fresh air, we opened the window vents, to discover that we were right above the spa with its overpowering perfumes. When we registered, we were told that the hotel was so very busy and nothing  could be done. Later in the evening I saw hundreds of people continuing to come in and register. Woke every morning with a raw throat. We asked one more time for a different room, but were again rebuffed.

So despite the accolades from The Hangover, and the hotel being known for being a little more on the high end, their filters for clearing out cigarette smoke from the hotel leaves something to be desired. Our floor was smoke free but we could still smell it.

Other than that, we really enjoyed the room. It was a Forum Tower Suite which had an OK view we could see the Rio in the distance but there was also the parking lot and walls to contend with. 

The bathroom had a hot tub, separate shower, and smaller bathroom off the main entrance of the room (which we took full advantage of!). Also, it had insane closet space, the bed was comfy and huge. The LCD TVs were just okay but who watches that much TV while in Vegas?

It's a bit of a walk through the hotel to get to our tower but it's close to the Forum Shops (hence the name of the tower) so that helped.

Location of the hotel itself is unbeatable, the minute you walk out from the lobby you're on the Strip.

We ordered room service on our last morning there (too lazy to look for options outside and had a flight to catch). It was really tasty but costly. Totally worth it if you don't have time\/energy.

Overall, I liked the hotel and would recommend but the cigarette smoke might lead me to stay elsewhere.",1,0,0

Where the FAIL Begins is you can tell old school hotel management run the new towers, not caring about the clients they are trying to attract. 

 You pay Ritz or Four Seasons prices, for a room in Vegas mind you, you're expecting a lot. They renovate, build new towers, name them, give you exclusive entrances, exclusive checkin-ins ( they don't tell you when you are paying a premium... that these check ins  have early hours so if you don't arrive by 3, you have to go stand in the Disney long lines with the riff raff) and even exclusive elevators. You think ok, it's super cheesy, but the room is going to be amazing. NOT. It's big, modern appointments, but IKEA like furniture. 

Here is where they lose us luxury clients...They give you a Kuerig in the room.... but you have to pay $12.00 if you want to have the pods and set up for one person, for coffee or tea. They have a big beautiful bath tub.... but only offer soap shampoo and conditioner, if you want bath gel or salts you have to buy them in the gift shop down stairs! (WHAT?!?!) There are no robe or slippers! If I am coming to they're rumoured amazing spa (more on that later, I am going later today), or shop in the epic Forum shops and not to gamble,  I want amenities for my $$. Not even a cotton ball or q-tips, 
Simple amenities....  if we pay these prices we expect things. The bed is comfortable, the pillows are great, you can still smell smoke from rooms around you supposedly non smoking floors. I will talk the the manager today and see what the reaction is and modify my review to include that as well as a spa review.

After checking in, we took the mile and half walk to our room. What's that??? A mile and a half walk to your room? Yes, this is a large resort, but more to the point, the designers of it should have thought more about the location of the elevators in the towers! They also should rethink charging people for coffee in the room. That's right, you'll pay for the Keurig cups if you want coffee in the room. Free coffee in a room is like a hotel standard, isn't it? (Notice I said hotel, not motel). It's still free to use the iron. 

At any rate, after refreshing in the room which overlooked the pools (great view - we did however have to request the view and upgrade). We headed down to the casino. After another mile and half walk back through long empty corridors we arrived in the lobby and casino area. 

It's Caesars 50th Anniversary but you couldn't tell that in the lobby, unless you happen to gander the tiny sash tossed across the chest of the Caesar statue at the front door...My point being, other hotels and casinos on the strip - Paris, Aria, Wynn, Bellagio - make considerable effort to bring in decorations and dress up their lobbies - and for just regular seasonal events (I noticed, Halloween for example). 

Would it kill you Harrah's (owners of Caesar) to spend a few grand on a nice floral arrangement for the lobby to celebrate your 50th? Perhaps a giant birthday cake or a display of the many entertainers that have graced your halls...But no, your marketing department deemed it much more suitable to hang a giant vinyl banner touting a hashtag and place a mall-level fiberglass horse and chariot (for selfies or photos) off to the side of the entrance. 

In the casino we found the experience no better, we played Blackjack for an hour before any table service - and asked the pit boss twice to request a server...But anytime during our three day stay, the same issue, getting a drink in the casino took considerable effort, even when playing any table games for any length of time. We had to either ask a manager to send over a server (and then waiting for 20-30 minutes for her to show) or wait an hour for one to come around. Casino was clean and common areas were also well maintained, in fact the housekeeping staff was very good. Requests for extra towels or other items were delivered promptly and with a smile. 

I would also like to call out the exceptional service and demeanor of a dealer named Jim, this older gentlemen dealt Blackjack and has worked at Caesars for over 30 years. He was both friendly (helping with gaming tips) and incredibly informative, providing great history lessons on Las Vegas and the casinos while we played. 

Finally, food here was average at best. We ate at Rao's one night - extremely disappointed, and at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill another afternoon. Neither the meal or experience were at all notable or recommendable. We also had a basket of fries at the pool - which took asking the runner where the fries were after about 45 minutes - fries showed up an hour after we ordered them. At least they were hot. Swim up Blackjack? Neat concept, but dealers were not friendly or welcoming.
 
Unless we were to get an extremely good deal, we would not stay at this resort again, as there are many, many other and better options on the strip. 

Oh, and one last item. As I mentioned, as a long time Vegas visitor and I am well aware of the ""working girls"" that roam the area. Caesars seemed to be overrun with them (WAY more so than other casinos we visited in the evenings). To the point, I and another male in our party were engaged by them, not once, not twice, but three times on property (sports bar, casino and walking back to the room). I have never had that experience in my 30 plus years of coming to this town (being blatantly propositioned like this). We of course refused their offers, because of wives, and morals. But if you are looking for ""who-ors"" this is the place to find them.",4,4,2

Pros:
* The service is great, whether you're a high roller or not
*Spacious rooms, very clean, nice large bathrooms
*Unbelievable shopping 
*Incredible restaurants, and a huge selection of them. Recommended: Spago, Neros and the place near the fountains in the Forum Shops (I forget the name)
*Very good room service. No little trays, they wheel in a whole beautifully set table. 
*Good drink service on the casino floor.
*The wedding planning services are great. Its very nerve wracking to plan a destination wedding, because you can't see anything in person, but they have everything down to a science. I highly recommend their wedding packages.

Cons:
*Pricey, and getting pricier. We weren't able to stay there on our last trip to Vegas because the room rates have gotten so high. The shops are mostly really high end as well, but there are some lower priced shops too.
*Lousy wedding photographer. That was the only part of our wedding I was disappointed with.

My family and I traveled to see Elton John and were completely ripped off. We were not notified of the cancelation until the auditorium was fully seated and everyone had spent their money on overpriced concessions. It would have been acceptable if they let us know prior to settling in for the show so we could find another show to watch. We were forced to wait until at least 10 minutes after showtime to figure out our Saturday night when most venues were completely sold out. You would think a business would try accomodate their guests who spent $200 per ticket for the Cesar's palace experience. However, they thought it was more important to make money.

Below average actually, for the price, but I have had some GREAT nights in the casino here and the Forum Shops are amaze, so I gotta give some props for location. If you are here to see Celine another benefit is that  you might run into her before the show. This happened to us when we stayed here for my cousin's 21st birthday and she was so excited (she's a huge Celine fan)!!!!

Pure is pretty disappointing, I don't really like the crowd too much but I have had a TON of fun at Shadow bar. 

The rooms are the major problem - expensive and not worth the price. If you are going to cough up that much for a room, you are better off staying at Venetian or Belliagio or better yet at the Wynn or Encore. Nothing special at all about the rooms and for some reason even the newly re-done rooms look worn and the bathrooms are kinda janky. Don't bother with the room-service. The food isn't very good and, although there are some great places at the Forum Shops, it would be nice if there was something right downstairs when you just need a quick bite (there's a food court but I'm not really a food court type of girl). And the breakfast is weak which blows after a long-night of partying when you are looking for brunch \/ possible hang-over cure.

After we had to fight for the rooms that were paid for by our boss, not to mention he paid for upgraded rooms as well. We had received an E-mail indicating that our rooms were ready however, they were not. Not only were they not ready we were not getting the rooms that were paid for. They wanted to put my co worker and I in a smoking room with 2 double beds. My other co workers were going to be put in a smoking room with 1 king bed. Ummmm I don't think so! Once I got the manager he then all of a sudden found our rooms go figure. There was another member that was with us however, she was in a different tower. Once we got to our rooms they were very nice and could not complain about them at all. 

When we checked in, although our rooms were paid for we each had to give our own credit cards for incidentals. Ok didn't think anything of it. Both my co-worker and I gave our CC and one co-worker out of the two in the other room gave her CC for incidentals. The other member we were with in the other Tower gave hers as well. I think there was only one charge to one of those CC and it was for WI Fi. All other charges to our cards were done as we went through our weekend.

By the time we returned home on Monday all 4 out of the 6 CC were compromised and had to be canceled. There was activity going on in stores that we were not anywhere near. Now 3 weeks later my bosses CC has been compromised. Activity going on in one of the Casino's. Why it took so long to get that one figured out is beyond me. Needles to say now 5 out of the 6 have had to be canceled. The only CC that was not compromised was the one co- worker that did not give hers to the front desk for incidentals. Now seriously don't you think there is something funky going on or what?

The room was too hot and the control for the AC would not let us cool it down, so it was very hard to sleep in the room.  We called the for help around 11pm, hoping they can tell us how to fix it -- they said they need to send an Engineer.  The Engineer arrived and try to fix it and could not, but in the process of trying set the AC too cooling without the ability to stop it (not his fault, there was clearly something wrong with the AC control and\/or unit), so he told us that we need to change rooms and he's already asked front desk to get us another one.  That was around 12 midnight, well over an hour after we had gone to bed trying to sleep - and the last thing we wanted to do was pack up and move to another room, but we had no choice.
15 min later, no word from the front desk, so I called and sked if they could expedite getting us to another room. I was told they will check on this and call me back.  I was assured someone would ""help move us"" so no need to pack.
No word for another 15 min, then I called again and this time stayed on the phone until the person said promised ""a bell staff is on his way to us.""  He again assured me someone would help us move.
5 or 10 minutes little later, someone called to ask if we are all completely packed up and ready to go.  (It was obvious no one was on his way to us and the person was contemplating sending them now.)  He sounded annoyed, and came off as pretty rude.  He assured me that if the bell person arrives and we are not all completely packed, the person would just go away.  No hint of customer service, let alone any kind of 'hospitality.'
We ended up mostly packing our suitcases.
The bell person did eventually show up around 12:45 and brought a cart on which we put all of our stuff and he helped us move.

Secondly, we checked in at a kiosk, which had a lot of disadvantages. We were not given a map of the hotel, and we were not told where anything was. In hindsight, I would have waited in the long line to be checked in by a person. This is especially important when it comes to a hotel the size of Caesar's Palace. We walked in circles literally miles looking for things. The gym was not clearly marked, and neither were the pools. Speaking of the pools, free convenient ice water should be a no-brainer in Las Vegas, but not at this resort! Expect to pay $2 a cup for water by the pool, even if you are paying for a $20 cocktail.  

Lastly, when I booked our room, I had no idea that the ""Forum Tower Rooms"" were the downgraded rooms at the hotel. There was no indication that this tower is a long walk from everything, and that it was the oldest of the towers. When we called and asked about moving rooms, we were told that we could not be accommodated due to availability, yet there were still rooms in the other towers for sale that same night. Poor customer service and an old building in need of a refresh. I will say that the WIFI included in the resort fee did work well. 

Overall, the entire stay was just more exhausting than it was relaxing which is very different from many other hotels that I have stayed at in Las Vegas, which were comparable or even less costly than this stay.

We originally booked the room through hotels.com, one of the rooms in the FORUM tower (one of many at Caesars). The rooms in FORUM tower are recently renovated with updated furniture and it looked very nice. Upon arrival, we realized that the rooms in FORUM tower don't have a bathtub, (which was a big deal for us) so when we checked in, we asked for an upgrade to a room that had a bathtub. There was a small extra fee per night but it was definitely cheaper than paying the regular rate for the room we were upgraded to : AUGUSTUS tower. 

Our room was very spacious (probably bigger than my old apartment) with a very comfortable king size bed, sitting area with sofa, dining area, a HUGE bathroom with  a bathtub and glass door shower with the toilet in a separate room. This particular room had the view of the strip and the pools at Caesars. We totally lucked out.

It is a HUGE hotel\/resort so it's very important to know exactly which tower and which casino you're in so you can find your way back after a few drinks. They have great restaurants : MESA grill by Bobby Flay, the Buchanal buffet (50 dollars but totally worth it) and others. 

Their pools are more mellow than most pools at other hotels, it's more of a relax and sip drinks kind of atmosphere, not let's have a huge party with 1000 people and a dj. 

The only downside to this great place was that there was a fee for everything. Like, if you even moved an item (even if you were to put it right back) in the bar fridge in the room, they will charge you. There will also be a charge upon checking out for resort fees and pool fees. Nothing too outrageous but no one ever wants to pay anything extra at the end.

Look, here's the deal. It's Vegas on the strip - So most things are going to be very expensive. But this place seems to charge more than usual. We went for our 25th wedding anniversary but the simplest things were over the top. ie: Coffee in the room was $12.00 for four of the little Keurig K-Cup packs. That's just nuts for something that should be complimentary. $ 39.00 for two beers and Margarita by the pool. 

We drove there from L.A. and when we got there, it seemed like your only choice to park was Valet parking, when all we wanted to do was drop off our luggage and self park as we weren't going anywhere for the weekend. It was unbelievable to see all of the people confused and getting railroaded into valet parking - they basically stick a ticket in your windshield and hand you a valet ticket - there was no provision whatsoever for dropping off luggage.

Check-in was a running ball of mass confusion. We stood in a line of about four or five couples in front of around 11:15 PM on a Thursday night. It took almost 45 minutes to check in. No, there was not a convention or anything going on that weekend.

The property is massive, so you need to be careful about how much you are trapped.

We found the hotel had rooms (via hotels.com) for roughly $150\/nt (check-in on Sunday). This was for a suite that included 2 queen beds & the site clearly showed that it accommodates up to 4 people. Well, it's my husband, my 2 small children & I = 4 people right??! We book, check-in , enjoy the pool, the buffet & hang out. 

A week later, my husband sees that his account was charged another $32.48 for their resort fee. I could've sworn that was included in our total as when we checked out it was a over $200 (this was for resorts fees & tax). But NOOOOO! They charged us an additional $60 because there was 4 of us. Are you F'ING KIDDING ME?!?!!!!!! The room clearly accommodates 4, there's 4 of us & yet...HERE'S AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE?!!!! OMFG. This is ridiculous. Were we supposed to split the family up? 1 parent with 1 child in 2 separate rooms?? What about the families that have 3 kids? This is absurd!! 

We could've easily stayed at one of the newer hotels for the same price without all these extra fees. We're never staying at Caesar's again. I can't believe how easy it is for them to rip people off & think it's OK.

My cousin got married here in the garden next to the amazing pool. Everything about this place is overwhelming yet fun. The place is ginormous and the Forum Shops attached to the hotel is an incredible, upscale mall. Restaurant selections are great too, including Spago, Mesa Grill, Palm Restaurant, and Rao's. The pool area is absolutely amazing - there are a number of separate pools with snack bars and a bar, cocktail waitresses that will bring you drinks all day long. There's even a ""private"" pool area, part of Pure nightclub, that you have to pay to get into (I didn't bother).

The rooms were nice enough, but I knocked off one star because they were lacking certain conveniences...like a soap dish in the bathroom. The bathroom at first glance looked nice - marble floor, big marble bathtub, even a red light in the ceiling (it looked like a security camera!). But the shower stall had only one soapdish to place your shower essentials, meaning I had to put my bottles of toiletries on the floor, which is not so convenient. Also, the shower stall was clearly designed by a man, because shaving my legs in there was no easy task. 

The casino area at Caesar's wasn't as big as some of the other casinos I visited, but it seemed like enough to me as I'm not a huge gambler. The Pussycat Dolls Lounge Casino area was fun, with leopard print chairs and go-go dancers. 

Luckily I was with family so I didn't have to pay for my room, otherwise I probably couldn't have afforded to stay here. It's not the most upscale of the Vegas casino hotels, but it's pretty damn nice. I'd definitely stay here again.",3,0,1

We checked into a deluxe room on the 24th floor located in the newish Palace Tower. 

Pros:
**For a deluxe room, it's quite spacious
** The views of the strip and Vegas valley = spectacular
** Excellent maid service 
**Bathrooms are spacious and lux
**Deep tub..nice 
**Ample closet space 
**Bed & pillows are comfy 
**Lots of restaurants w\/food court 
**Adjacent to Forum Shops (if you're into shopping)
**Overall, CP's location is great for walking along the strip 
**Excellent lounges throughout the casino to relax, converse, people watch, and sip drinks

Cons: 
**The ""you touch..you buy"" snacks & mini bar is annoying. If you have little ones..BEWARE!! The price for convenience is expensive-- $13 for  snack sized peanuts! 
**The walls are a little thin at  the Palace Tower.. We heard screaming children, crying infants, and very loud parents next door..A Jack n' Jill door ( which could be opened) separated our rooms. 

Overall, our two night stay was pleasant. ..would stay here again. We'll ask in advance for no loud families right next door.

I went last October & decided to take my daughters blanket since it was my first time leaving her. Mind u this was the blanket I had at the hospital when she was born. Anyways on our second day we decided to let room service clean the room while we walked the strip (my cousins idea, I never let room service in the room). We were gone a few hours came back, got ready for the night & left again. When we returned to the room to finally go to sleep I noticed it was missing. That was the worst feeling ever. It was bad enough I was away from my daughter, then to lose the blanket made it worse. The next morning we went to the service desk to tell them it was gone. We got the run around about how ""the policy"" worked & at the end got a # to call when we got home. After a week I called & I was told it was ""under investigation"" & I should give it some time. I waiting almost a month & called back & wasn't able to get through to anyone. I left several messages & to this day have not received a call back. I'm not sure if the cleaning lady took it or if it was in the pile of sheets she took. I was absolutely heart broken. To think I was so happy to stay there for the first time & then this happened.

It looks much the same as it did back in the 90's but they haven't let it get run down or anything. I wish we could afford a room in the new fancy Nobu tower but unfortunately we were in the Forum tower which I believe is the oldest one. Our room was still nice looking and clean so I have no complaints. However, if you are planning to use the spa or fitness center they are both located in the Augustus tower so it might be worth paying a little extra for that. It was also a pretty far walk (thru the middle of the casino) to the swimming pools. I think all the other towers are closer to the pools and restaurants but the Forum is closer to the shopping. It is also somewhat close to the sports book which was in full swing with it being March Madness. Apparently Caesars is like March Madness Central because of the ginormous TV they have that you can see throughout that entire wing of the casino. Even all the other bars and restaurants had the games on. And they were all packed with people watching. I did place one bet at the sports book and I will say that they were friendly and efficient and had plenty of staff to handle the crowds.

I felt very overwhelmed staying here and was very ready to leave by the end of the trip. Part of it probably had to due with the March Madness crowds but also this property is just too big and is not laid out in a way that makes it easy to get around or find what you are looking for.

It's a lot to cover with your wheely bags but we made it to the front desk. I had heard about the long lines but it was average.  We had Cheryl check us in and she was lovely. I had read some negative reviews on their service but I was very happy.  She even upgraded us to a deluxe suite.  It was Amazing!!  We had 1000 sq feet of luxury.  The bathroom was to die for a with Koehler SoK tub. If you don't know what that is...it's a tub where you can fill it to the top so your shoulders don't get cold and the extra water runs down the lip that is all around. It had jets and light changes. We each took a bath immediately! I couldn't find the toilet bit it was hidden behind a door near the fabulous sit or stand three shower head shower.  The bed relaxing. The cleaning lady was adorable! Big tip! Do not take anything out of the fridge unless your going to drink it. It's weighed n computerized so they know. They will then charge you a 25 rental fee. We had brought a bottle of prosecco to enjoy. Oh well. My friend forgot her toothbrush and they sent one up. A small fee but very helpful.
The qua spa was incredible and a MUST! Pricey but if you have three hours to relax to for it! We need to treat ourselves more often.  We also ate at the old Homestead steakhouse which was divine. The ribeye cooked perfectly.  We sort of never left the Caesers compound we loved our room so much!  Peyard for breakfast is you want that French experience which we did.

We went out to dinner and a show to come back to the room around 1am to a baby screaming its head off. My girlfriend and I figured it was luck of the draw and we just happen to be given a room next to a family with a baby. 
We went to bed only to be woken up by said baby a few hours later, still it was okay I figured it would be best to get up early to see the city anyway. 
The second I get out of bed I feel a puddle at my feet and hear a squishing noise. There was a puddle of foul smelling liquid at my feet and in the corner of the room (hidden by a dresser) some serious long term water damage. At this point I call the front desk letting them know. They take hours to get a new room ready, only for the new room to not be cleaned. So here I am several hours after first calling about the foul smelling, hopefully not sewage, in my first room writing this review waiting for the house keepers to come clean my much smaller 2nd room. 
Just for clarity everyone I encountered was pleasant and sorry about the trouble but there is no reason I major hotel on the strip should be giving rooms away with unknown liquids running through the walls and covering the floors as well as giving assess to rooms that have not been cleaned from prior guests. The other troubling aspect was that we were given this ""up graded"" room that presumably someone else didn't want because it had liquid running into it and a baby next door so they pawned it off on us disguised as a free upgrade.",0,0,0

Wenn ihr hier ein Zimmer bucht, vergewissert euch, dass ihr nicht im Roman Tower untergebracht seid. Es ist der älteste Teil des Gebäudes und das ist auch direkt sichtbar wenn man das Zimmer betritt!
Keine Minibar, Teppiche hatten schon bessere Tage erlebt, Zimmer sind ziemlich dunkel, der Ausblick nicht erwähnenswert. Alles in allem sehr enttäuschend. Für 200USD die Nacht bekommt man da wirklich deutlich bessere Unterkünfte!

Dennoch zwei Sterne, denn das Caesars ist alles in alle sehr beeindruckend. Der Eingangsbereich sucht seinesgleichen. Einfach 100% edel, großzügig und legendär gestaltet. Nicht umsonst werden hier viele Filmszenen gedreht. Echt genial.

Dann der Pool. Das ist wirklich eine gewisse Magie. Man fühlt sich wohl wie im alten Rom. Der Pool war umwerfend. Nicht sehr tief, aber im Sommer für Poolparty wohl genau richtig. Aber die anderen Gebäude direkt um den Pool schaffen eine besondere Atmosphäre. Ein Bier kostet 11USD. Aber es macht einfach auch Spaß dort am Pool zu liegen und ein Bierchen zu genießen. Warum? Es ist so wie das ""sehen und gesehen werden"" Ding was dort passiert. Extrem unterhaltsam.

Unser Zimmer hat eben den Unterschied gemacht. Denn Casino, Pool, und die gesamte Anlage waren einfach umwerfend. Aber wenn man eben dort übernachten möchte, sollte das Zimmer auch den Ansprüchen gerecht werden. Das hat eben nicht gepasst. Ansonsten ein Must See!",7,5,7

Also, we were there to see Sandy Lam at the Colosseum so it was pretty convenient for us to stay here and head downstairs to catch the concert.

We got two queen-sized beds on the 13th floor. The place was clean and I have no complaints. I especially love the bathroom! There were two sinks (thank goodness, since there was three of us), a TV so I can brush and watch at the same time, a glorious bathtub with a shower head, and a shower with not just one shower head but TWO medium pressure sprays right below (it was a massage in a shower!)

I would never stay anywhere else. We have stayed at the Luxor, Venetian and Mandalay Bay. Caesars has my vote hands down. I do not agree that it is a dinosaur. But everyone has their own experiences. I have stayed there over five times in the last three years. I love it.

The remote wouldn't work to turn it off, change the channel, change the volume. So, I called the front desk to report it.  I definitely wasn't going to run down to the front desk in my pj's.  

The next morning when I checked out, they charged me for the phone call...in house!!!!  When I complained to the front desk person, she asked me if it was working now.  I said ""yes"".  She replied ""oh good, now I don't have to write up a service request"".   When I inquired why and when did they start charging for in-house calls.  She stated that is just the way it is...  

What kind of customer service is this!!!  I call to tell them their equipment isn't working, basically doing them a favor and rather than apologize... I get charged for it!!!!   There are so many other good choices in Vegas.  I would stay away from this hotel.  They have gotten too big for their britches!  

I also went the year before.  My reservation was for an up-graded room.  They stuck me in the oldest part of the hotel.  And, if that's not enough for you, my room wasn't even clean!  There was hair on the wall of the shower and on the floor of the bathroom.  I had to trek all the way back through the hotel (a 30 min walk) back to the front desk, wait in line to tell them they put me in the wrong room and it was not clean.  If I didn't say anything, they would have left me in a lower room.  What a scam!  What more can I say...STAY AWAY!!!!!",0,0,0

Caesars also has the Forum shops which has nice stores in it but it also has stores like Express and the Gap that you'd find at your local mall.  The shops aren't as high end as what you'd find at the Bellagio or Wynn but there are still nice stores so you have an idea of what to expect.  

The hotel has some pretty famous places such as Mesa Grill (I completely don't recommend going there) and Pur nightclub.  Although I've had bad experiences at both Pur and Mesa Grill, the hotel itself is still very nice and there's much to see there.

Customer service is non-existent at this property, with the exception of the occasional veteran cocktail waitress (""We used to be called 'Goddesses'"").  Don't bother trying to arrange anything through the concierge as this property no longer has any idea of what it is the job of a concierge should entail (a gift basket sent to a room?  call the patisserie directly yourself.  dinner reservations for 10?  call the hotel restaurant yourself.  wth?).  I'm not even sure why they bother to have a concierge.

Don't bother to try and complain to the parent company either (which is Harrah's and has been for 3-4 years now), all they will do is say oh sorry.  Yeah, that's it.  

I love what used to be and maybe still is the main gaming floor of the casino.  You can tell it was built with class and panache.  It's dingy now though and all but completely overshadowed by the gambling extension that includes the (stupidest thing I've ever seen) ""PussyCat Dolls Stripper Show and Gaming"" area.  Caesar's traded in class for ass.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.

You know it's bad when the (not purposely skanked stripper wannabe employee) dealers are equating their job to working for slavemasters, when employees tell you that the company used to be great to work for before the beancounters bought it out, and the cocktail waitresses (when you can find one AT ALL!!)  hate their outfits and clearly feel they used to be treated better as employees.

As for rooming...we had something in the renovated Augustus Tower, and it was very well done, even had a great view of the Bellagio fountains (shame we couldn't hear the music).  One of our friends, however, had the misfortune to book into a Centurion room.  She couldn't sleep (bad bed, thin walls), there was no door on her bathroom, and the room was ghetto.

The redone pool area is...interesting.  Clearly, this place was made for people to lounge, to see and be seen.  Forget actually swimming, it's not deep enough.  We paid for a cabana by the I think Jupiter pool, had it for 1p.m.-7 p.m., and guess what?  At 5 p.m. they decide to close that pool to put a shock treatment in.  Really?  That couldn't wait 2 more hours?  We had to walk to another pool to get cool.  Stupidest damn thing ever.

I've reviewed the restaurants and shops I visited there separately, but suffice to say the only good restaurants in that hotel are Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and Rao's.  Qua baths and spa is also a remarkable experience.

Almost forgot to mention the gaming.  No good blackjack, though we played a little anyway.  Barely any fun slots and all the denominations are mixed in an incoherent way, plus the layout of the slots is not comfortable (as in I felt like I was in the way of traffic all the time and didn't want to continue sitting there).  We got maybe 3 drinks apiece the whole weekend while gambling (and 2 of those were at the blackjack table from the sweet veteran waitress).  Just not a place worth losing money at.  I'm used to losing money gambling, but come on - at least give me drinks and a good time while I'm doing it otherwise I won't come back to lose more to you.

I am just so saddened by this visit.  I really thought it would be a special place, but it is just a sad shell of it's former glory.  The soul has left and the heart beating there is cold and weak.  Unless the property changes hands again, I won't go back to stay, though I will go back for the Mesa Grill.",3,1,0

Arrived in Ceasars for our Holiday in Vegas (familly for Xmas) with Apricot the fluffy white dog in tow.  It has the most complicated Valet parking with its winding road to the self-parking and separate Valet for the Colosseum (theater).  We were redirected to the Main Entrance where they mentioned that it might be difficult to get valet parking because it was busy unless you were Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Total Rewards program.

Somehow with Apricot, we get good vibes.  Waited in line for the valet, mentioned we were checking in and was given the parking ticket for the valet and off we went to go check in.  At Check-in, we were told that 45 min wait for our room (pet stay deluxe) but the Front Desk saw Apricot and wham, she tried her best to find us a room quick.  

The room itself is one of the rehabbed rooms in the Augustus tower (which is the only tower that will accept pets).  It has a separate entrance for the Augustus and Octavius towers but again only for Diamond and Seven Stars.  We had a wonderful room with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The room was spacious and as I mentioned remodeled so it was a nice shower and jacuzzi tub with all the modern amenities including robes.

For the most part Ceasars is one of the higher end Harrah properties on the strip but it's also showing it's age.  There is a mix of old and new.  Gambling is a bit pricey since minimum on the game tables are $15 or $20.  This are the minimums I find in the newer places like Cosmopolitan or Aria which are definitely more modern and high end.

The food choices are plentiful but again it's showing its age.  There is supposed to be a new NOBU hotel within Ceasars soon which will be higher end.

We had to go to the Forum Shops valet, and the valet guy tells us that they can park our car, but we would have to move it by midnight, otherwise we'd get charged $20 to keep our car there overnight. First of all, we were not planning on using our car once we checked in. We were just going to leave it at the valet for the night. Second of all, it is not our problem that the Ceasars valet was full... We were guests and shouldn't have to leave our car further away, and on top of that pay to leave it overnight. This was ridiculous!!! When I talked to the guy at check in, I asked if there was anything they can do.

I am a total rewards member and I go to Vegas about 5 or 6 times a year. I think the whole hotel is quite nice and the service is decent except for the front desk! 

On my earlier stay about three weeks ago I had gone to speak to someone at reception to make sure I wasn't being double charged for the resort fees and the man at reception who was actually quite polite had called over his supervisor to answer the question as he was unsure. He was completely rude to me and I had to walk away because I was just shocked at the attitude of a ""supervisor"".

So on my most recent stay I was staying in the Augustus tower and when I had checked in I had asked for a room facing the Bellagio. No problem so far.... My wife and I get up to the room and we can't get in and the room was facing the wrong side. I went downstairs got in the huge line again and was then told several times by the gentleman at reception that it was probably because I had put the room card by my phone to which I replied that cannot be the case as I was holding it the whole time. He was having none of it and making out like I was lying. Once he checked the card he realized that they had actually put in the wrong room number on the card and it was there mistake. When I asked to get moved to a Bellagio facing room I was told it was not possible as I had checked in 2 hours ago..... hmmmm strange... All I had done was walk to the room and back and I was being told I had been there for two hours. I tried to explain that was not the case to which he said he would ""call"" to ask. 

No idea who he would need to call, I am sure that is something they can checl on the the computer screen but he said no.

Not only is it conveniently located right in the middle of everything, it is the only hotel in town that combines cheese AND class -- most places only have one or the other!
Class: the spa is world-class, Michael Boychuck runs the salon, the Augustus and Palace towers are beautiful, and the pool area is huge and varied and very tastefully appointed, with topless areas to escape the hordes of children.  The Colosseum is supposedly the premier performance venue west of the Mississippi (state of the art sound system, etc, blah blah blah).  PURE is possibly the douchiest nightclub in the land , the Pussycat Dolls deal blackjack, and the attached Forum Shops have every pretentious ripoff luxury store known to man.  In addition, there are probably at least 30 restaurants on property (including those in the Forum), including obscenely overpriced celebrity eateries like Guy Savoy's, Brad Ogden's and Bobby Flay's.
Now, more importantly -- Cheese: they have actors hired to stroll around dressed as Roman characters, who break into impromptu speeches in awesome fake-old-timey voices, and who are more than happy to pose for fotos with guests.  Caesars is one of the last hotels to retain its themed shtick, which it has kept since 1966, and which is reflected in the rooms in some of the older, dumpier towers (Centurion, Forum and Roman).  Everything has a wonderfully outdated fake-Roman twist to it, from the casino carpet to the employee uniforms.  It is unabashedly old-school... so if you're looking for McLuxury and to have your ass kissed with a sterling silver feather, look elsewhere.  If, however, you are in Vegas to have FUN and experience the True Spirit of Vegas, please come in!  
Sure, the place is rambling and labyrinthine -- it was built piecemeal over 44 years, so what do you expect?  All the more interesting to wander around in a drunken stupor, my friends. Popcorn ceilings and dangling acrylic jewels... a nightclub shaped like an old-tyme Egyptian barge... a shoeshine man who gets soused on Chardonnay every night and parties to smooth jazz on a little boom box... cocktail waitresses who have been there since opening day, and who are still forced to wedge themselves into sexy mini-togas... dealers who wear silk blouses with their names embroidered in fake-Greek script, and who give their golden Caesars medallions away at the end of every shift...what's not to like?

Our trip was going really well, until one morning! We had spent the night gambling, so we didn't wake up for awhile the next day. When we did wake up, we heard strange noises in our bathroom! I got out of bed to realize, THERE HAD BEEN BLACK GUNK AND GOO SPLATTERING OUT OF THE DRAIN FROM OUR SINK! talk about disgusting! We hurried to remove our things from the area before it had splattered onto our tooth brushes and toiletries! There was BLACK WATER AND HAIR THAT CAME FROM THE DRAIN OF THE SINK!

SO disappointed in what happened next.

We called the  front desk to let them know what was going on, and they told us that they would be sending up a mechanic right away! He told us that he had been unclogging the drain from a different tower, which is why stuff was coming up from our sink. He unclogged our sink, then called someone to come and sanitize the sinks. As he left, he asked us if it was okay to move the do not disturb sign from the outside of the room, to the inside of the room, which we agreed to! He told us that if we left that on, housekeeping would probably ignore us.

By then, we just wanted to take showers, get ready to enjoy our vacation....but 20 minutes later, noone came by.....so we called front desk, and they said they put a rush on it........ another 20 minutes went by...noone came by... THE PERSON ON THE PHONE SAID ""YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN THE ROOM"" yeah... WE COULDNT EVEN GET READY. WHAT DO THEY EXPECT? US TO WALK AROUND UNWASHED AND UNCLEAN? they might do that on their spare time, but we don't enjoy doing that!! 



so we called the front desk and they said after the rush, it usually takes 30 minutes....so we waited 15 minutes, then called back again. 

By then, we were so frustrated because we just wanted to go out on our vacation! We asked to speak with a manager, which she said would call us later tonight, we asked to speak with a supervisor, they were on the phone. SEEMED LIKE ALL THE MANAGEMENT WAS BUSY. Some more time went by, and we were just extremely frustrated. The only reason why I got off the phone was because they had told me that the someone was coming directly to the room. I specifically asked, ""SO YOU'RE SAYING, SOMEONE IS COMING DIRECTLY TO OUR ROOM TO SANITIZE THE MESS?"" she said yes. it might take a few minutes to go up the elevator, but someone is coming right away"" GUESS WHAT. THEY DID NOT. 

WE GO TO CAESAR'S PALACE BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEND HOTELS, BUT CLEARLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.

I called front desk again, and finally got to speak with a manager. She told me ""there should be a housekeeper knocking on your door right now."" nope...no one knocked....She told me that she would call back in 5 minutes to make sure someone came. We heard someone outside our door, and we saw it was the manager of housekeeping. SHE TOLD US THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL SHE HAD GOTTEN. we literally called housekeeping 5 times, and she tells me that it was the first call she got. are you serious?! 

The manager called back and said the reason why noone came earlier was because there was a do not disturb sign on the door. ARE YOU SERIOUS!? i told her the mechanic specifically told us to take out off, and he was the one that moved it into the inside of our room.... and she said ""the housekeeper said that there was one there, which is why noone came."" ARE YOU SERIOUSSSSSS WHAT A LIEEEEEE. if you're going to lie to save yourself, you should at least have a reasonable lie. 
This manager was SUCH a joke!!!

I asked her, why did someone tell us someone was coming right away but noone came? She said ""i don't have an answer for that. I can't tell you why noone came""

I asked her if she was blaming us for noone coming because of the do not disturb sign that was not hanging outside? she said ""No I am not. That's not what I'm trying to say."" Okay...then why did you say your housekeeper said it was there when it wasnt?""

I asked her why the housekeeping manager had said this was the first call when it should have  been the 5th call. She said ""the Housekeeping manager is wrong and she had no idea what she was talking about""
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT BEEN CALLED.

This manager offered us 50$ food credit to caesars. WHAT A JOKE. 50$ WAS NOT WORTH WASTING OUR VACATION JUST SITTING AROUND OUR HOTEL ROOM BEING GROSS, HUNGRY, AND DIRTY! she then offered us 75$. I wanted to tell her to shove it. Have you seen the prices for Caesar's food? LIKE HAVE YOU? WHAT A JOKE. this alsjfl;sakdjfla;skdjfl;kj this hotel has now become a joke to me. 



I'll be applying for an M Card now. Thanks but no thanks.


ALSO,  the floor we were on was nonsmoking, but our room reeked of smoke, and even had an ash tray sitting on the table...nonsmoking my ass...",14,5,0

The palace should have better (if any) coupons for it's own buffet, shows and restaurants... for those staying at the hotel (as one should). Sadly, Your very best ""deal"" for anything ""Ceaser's"" will be found elsewhere. 

Advice to Ceaser's Palace....give waaaay better deals to those who stay there.

Advice for visitors....Mesa Grill had the best service.

We booked online and paid way more than we usually do for a hotel in Vegas thinking that this was the famous Ceasars and it was worth it. We were wrong. 

After waiting over an hour to checkin at 11p while there were 4 agents at the desk, we were given a room in the Roman towers. It was a complete dump! The room was no better than a motel or red roof in at the side of a freeway. Let's go over the things the room did not have: Full length Mirror, mini bar, sofa or arm chair, closet, DRESSER! I could go on. It looked absolutely bare. The bed was awful and the room and bathroom were grimy. The worst part was the air conditioning that sounded like it was going to fall out of the ceiling. It was extremely loud and shaking. There was no water pressure in the shower never mind the shower head covered in mold. The next day I called to complain and David was an absolute angel. He said they were fully booked but that He would upgrade us if there was something else available in a nicer tower. Thankfully they had one room in Octavius available that was an accessible room so the only thing we were missing was the bath. The next room in Octavius was a thousand times nicer but honestly we would never pay what they were asking for that room because for the same price you can get a suite at the palazzo and Bellagio. 

The pools were really nice but there wasn't enough chairs. It sucked having to setup shop on the ground because there was never enough seating. Also on the first day we ordered food and it never came, we tried to find a server but there were non to be found so we left and had lunch elsewhere. Also they charge $2 for a cup of water even if you order a full meal, that's pretty ridiculous. 

The second day our wakeup call never came even though the first day there was no wakeup call issues. It's a good thing we set our phone alarm just in case. 

On the last day they sent us on a wild goose chase that really pissed us off, I won't get into it but in short the place is too big and not worth a Vegas stay. The $30 resort fee only includes the room wifi for two devices and the gym. It's also mandatory like most Vegas resorts but absolutely not worth a stay here.",2,0,0

With the Total Rewards card and some online promotion, I got a great deal for about $60 per night.

I found everyone to be super friendly, even the dealers and cocktail waitresses. Of course, it helped to be in a good mood since things were good at the blackjack tables. As a kid, Caesars was always one of those hotels that was the creme de la creme. There was no Wynn or Venetian back then. I was used to staying at Circus Circus for most of the time. 

But now, there are some great deals. Also check out their Twitter page, which you can find promotions. Sure, you'll find your stereotypical, loud-mouthed douchebag or 10-inch heeled hoochie tramp, but hey it's Vegas. Would you rather see mostly Ben-Gay smelling retirees? I think not.",5,7,6

I booked a reservation and got an upgrade to the Palace tower.  I tried to finagle a free upgrade but no such luck.  My chances were strong, it being a weekday. I ended up paying about $66.00 additional for the two days I stayed there. It was worth it!! My room was huge and clean. I could've shared it with 3 other people and still would be plenty of room.

Always an open seat on the gambling floor and large enough that I never feel boxed in, like at some casinos.  I had a nice 6 night stay when I was here, but I was dissatisfied with my experience for this being a high end casino.  I understand that keeping up with the Jones' has never been more true than for Las Vegas strip casinos, so I understand construction happens.  However, they shut down the pool for 2 days during our visit in the summer because it was a windy day and they feared items would fall from the construction being done in the towers.  Now don't get me wrong, I agree that if there was a chance of that, the pool should be closed, but in the height of summer I felt they should have their construction sites locked down better to prevent this.

Also, I tried the $20 sandwich technique (putting a $20 bill between your license and credit card during check in and asking for an upgrade - works great at most places, even higher end ones), however, I was told that it was not necessary and the receptionist offered me a chance to upgrade for a fee.  I decided, why not and chose to upgrade.  I was pretty upset when I found out that with the cost of the upgrade plus the base rate, I was charged more than if I originally booked the upgraded room.

This is what Vegas is all about - the sights, the sounds, the smell of old lady perfume wafting throughout the casino. Mix in some smoke, some booze and crying gamblers who've lost their plane tickets home and it's a complete vacation!

Clearly, this is a more upscale place to stay and to gamble but does anyone come to Vegas to save money? No. The rooms are clean and there are a ton of them! Beware that you will now be charged a RESORT FEE on top of the normal room rate. Basically, it's another rip-off disguised as a fee but what can you do?

What I really like about Caesar's is the antiquated feel of the whole place. Not that it's old and run down but that the statues and paintings and walls really came from antiquity. I love the Romanesque vibe and in Vegas who doesn't like a couple of naked people hanging around - even if they're made of marble?

While staying here the check-in\/out process was fairly efficient and the front desk staff was really nice. They have a bell desk to check bags and there are plenty of fine restaurants for your dining pleasure. I really like that they have a food court now which is right next to the entrance to the Forum Shops. It's a good option. 

I very quickly lost a lot of money on the roulette table so from there on out I had to stick to slots. There are a ton of fun games so just take some time and check it out. 

One of the best things about this place is how huge it is. There is almost no reason to leave at all. Shopping, food, gambling, bars, clubs, offtrack betting, rooms for sleeping or throwing up - who could ask for more?

Stayed 2 nights 3 days, and the problems started from the get go. After check-in me and the Mrs. went straight to the pool. Tried to get in but was told pool was closed for the time being and would open shortly, this was around 4:00 pm. We sat there twittling our thumbs for about an hour and half, and asked again at 5:30 pm. Told once again it would open shortly, but the pool closes at 6:00 pm... Disappointed, we headed to the Bacchanal for dinner. 

We were sat relatively quick, but that was the only positive for the dining experience. After fixing a plate of food we immediately noticed horde of flies around the dining area, so we immediately asked to be moved. We were moved to an area where we had an unhelpful waitress and just wanted to end our evening. That was Bacchanal experience #1. 

Next morning after being told the pool was yet again closed, we went straight to breakfast. We decided to give Bacchanal another shot because they claimed they ""fumigated"" the problem. Well... the hostess sat us on a table that had flies on them as well as the next table over. I told my wife to keep calm as I asked for a supervisor or a manager. The manager Raz came and was in shock because he had received emails about this the night before. He thought the problem was gone. He took us to a spot that seemed exclusive for diamond and seven stars members. We concluded our meal with a much more adept waitress. However, our appetite was already shot due to this experience so we only had dessert and drinks. The manager asked for another chance to rectify the situation. He offered a BOGO with a single round of drinks and no wait in line. 

Trying to salvage the day, we went to the sportsbooking area for some drinks. One of the bartender, a short asian male with mustache, refused to make us drinks. A rum and coke... was too much to ask for. He said he could give us shots of rum, but refused to mix drinks. Really!?!? I was very close to curb stomping this douche, so I just walked away. We headed over to the food court, ordered a pizza, took it to our room, and called a night.

We decided next morning to take Raz up on his offer, the day we were due to check out. We emailed him, as he requested, an hour or so before we wanted to come in. My wife emailed him at 7:02 am requesting to be seated around 8:00 am, but we never heard from him. We made our way down to Bucchanal around 8:20 am with the voucher for the BOGO. When we arrived the cashier did not know what was going on and we had to wait 15 minutes for Raz to come to the front. The irony is there was no one in line and we would have been sat quicker had it not been for this BOGO voucher. Nevertheless, we proceeded to get seated. It was about the 10 minutes later that we started noticing, you guessed it, flies. After noticing the first one, we quickly counted 4+ just around our table. I hastily went to the front and showed them pictures and videos of our problem and requested for upper management. Raz came to the front in about 10 minutes. I expressed my extreme frustration as this was the third time. He assured me that I will have an opportunity to speak with the General Manager (GM), and meanwhile moved us to another table. 

The GM Brian showed up an hour and half later, made excuses and said he would comp the BOGO offer. That was pretty much it, and then he walked away. Raz stayed, as I was in disbelief. We patiently waited an hour and half and all he offered was the  minimal. At this point it was nearing checkout time, and we had yet to begin our meal. Our intentions to have breakfast had now bled over to lunch. I asked my wife to run to the hotel front desk and see if they could accommodate a later check out time due to the debacle. Minutes later my wife returns furious because a supervisor named Kobra, who was claiming to be a manager, had told my wife to get our belongings out of the room since check out is 11:00 am. She further proclaimed herself as the highest authority in the hotel, so any further grievances were to be made to corporate. I lost it at this point. I tried to be so civil and understanding, but the more I tried to be understanding the more they abused my kindness. I called Raz over and demanded all of my money back. I refused to be robbed $150 per meal we had there while receiving this type of treatment. Raz agreed and refunded all of our money. Now that this was handled I made my way to the front.
 
I requested to speak with a manager that I was able to verify themselves as management. Lo and behold, I am introduced to David. I explain to him the ludicrous circumstances of why I wished to speak to him. He acted like he was in disbelief. He asked what I would like to be done to rectify the situation. I asked him back, what he thought was fair. He said he would extend the checkout to 3:00 pm. He further said he wanted to comp a future visit, for our ridiculous experience.",1,0,0

Since I was of legal gambling age, this was my go-to hotel on the strip, as the service and food were second to none, and while I wasn't a high-roller by any means, I did what was needed to be remembered by hosts. So I have a LONG history.

Then things in town shifted around with the advent of Wynn, Encore, Cosmopolitan, and Aria. Party hotels became available more accessible to the not-so-elite, and all of a sudden, Caesar's became a contender for the new breed of Sin City. Think of a strong but aging race horse. Not done by any means, but not sexy.

The casino staff and cocktail waitresses were stodgy and dry, tired, and boring. But this was offset by some cool bars and lounges, restaurants, including the amazing Bachanal buffet (in my book, the BEST buffet in the country), and Nobu.

And it got bigger. HUGE. Get used to walking far...... and heaven forbid you take a wrong turn and have to backtrack. The property is so large you never realize how far everything is.

These days, I still stop by Caesars for food and Absinthe (I see it regularly), and indulge in craps for the love of the game, but don't enjoy the table game staff. The high-limit slots are boring and lack variety, so I always end up leaving.

I know Omnia is one of the largest clubs in Vegas, but I have my hosts at Jewel, Hakkasan, Light, and XS, so I haven't been given a good reason to branch out yet, so can't comment on this aspect.

The swimming pool is probably my favorite in Vegas (no, not the party pools like Daylight, Liquid, or Encore Beach Club, but normal resort pools). It simply oozes luxury resort, and is one of the main reasons I'll still come back.

It's still a good place. I just hate walking huge distances to get to my room, to hit the casino floor, or chill by the pool.",4,3,3

I've never truly experienced the lavish aspects of hotels until I came to Vegas. I've stayed at their standard suites but then there are the villas. 

The villas at the Caesars have their own security and separate entrance card. 

When I first walked in, I was in awe of the high ceilings and the enormity of the villa. You're greeted with a butler and some welcome gifts.

The views of our villa overlooks the Garden of the Gods oasis. We had our own jacuzzi on our large terrace. Even separate terraces with tables to dine and wine.

My room had a walk in closet with two TVs and a hot tub jacuzzi with walk-in shower. Bvlgari Bath & Body.

So first and foremost, I think for what is actually given room wise the price is more then adequate..I have my total rewards card and I'm not sure if it helps out or not, but I always have found the room rates to be well within the price range and certainly well worth every penny when it's all said and done..I have seen in some reviews that price is an issue and I pose the question of why you go through with it then..GO TO A MOTEL 6 and at the very least not hold Caesar's liable for your poor judgement!

I have stayed in both the Forum Tower and just recently the Augustus Tower which once there I don't think I can stay anywhere else! The room we had literally faced the Bellagio (even from the bed laying down I was staring right at the ""O"" sign outside of the Bellagio) and is about twice or even three times the size of my apartment..How can you go wrong with that? The deluxe room had a king bed, couch, ""dining area"", and of course the most kick booty view ever all for as I said above an AFFORDABLE price! Overall, I really don't see myself going back to anything lower then what I experienced here!

Staff wise I had no issues at all during the entire trip..I mean everyone from casino attendants to security smiled and said hello so certainly the other reviews with non cordial individuals seems out there to me, but who knows maybe I just got lucky? Either way I have no complaints nor have I ever been mistreated during my 2 stays there for that matter.

I do admit that having a Tower Room makes it easier to walk to the parking structure when it's time to actually go back home, but having the Augustus Tower room definitely made a difference when tired from walking the strip as it was right at the front of the casino..I guess that's a tit for tat sort of deal right?

Before I ramble I can say this..It is not that far off price wise from any other hotel WORTH staying at and it's good to feel catered to and if I have felt like Caesar himself after my stays here then they are doing something right. I'm anxious to come back for many more outings and innings..Haha",0,0,0

While trying to sit on or lay in bed I could feel & hear each spring in action. Unbelievable... even when I've stayed at Circus Circus I've gotten much better mattresses with pillow top and nicer decor. The carpeting in the hallways and guest room is very old and needs to get shampooed or replaced. 

I had a good time one of the gaming tables, made a bit of money, so I was happy with my lucky experience. The. I headed to the cashier by the Roman Tower entrance, and the older cashier woman wasn't very pleasant. I don't know if she must've been having a bad day at\/outside of work, but she should be smiling when casino guests approach her window. After all, our losses cover her paycheck.

We arrived at Caesars and were placed in the Forum tower in a non-smoking room which was very run down for how much we'd paid for it. There were scratches and marks all over the TV cabinet, the room was very dark and we had a view of the back car park. Unfortunately I fell ill on the second day of our stay so had to call a Doctor to the room. The receptionist promised to call the company to send one out ASAP, we waiting three hours with no word so called back... She hadn't called the Doctor because she'd misunderstood something I'd said.
We also had a guest moved in next door to us who was a chain smoker, filling our room with the foul aroma of fresh cigarette smoke. When we complained the hotel offered to switch our rooms which, although worked out well in the end, seemed really ridiculous considering we'd been in our apartment for two nights already and they were aware that I was deathly ill.

On saying that, when we did get moved (to the Augusta Tower) we were given an entire non-smoking floor and an absolutely breathtaking room... why we weren't given this to begin with, I don't know, as we were informed it was slightly less than the one we paid for.

The ambience on the Casino floor and helpfulness of the staff was top notch. The restaurants second to none and the overall out of hotel experience was wonderful.

I'm sure this place was great 40 years ago, but it seems to be the hotel that time forgot.  I've had better rooms at an Econolodge in rural Mississippi.

To be fair, I hear that some of the renovated rooms at the hotel are lovely.  That's great, unless you get stuck in the Roman Tower.  I'm sure it cool once - but then again, so were the Village People.

My room was small.  The carpet was ""vintage"".  The bed was hard and old.  There were a grand total of two electrical outlets in the room.  Fine for an era when the only thing you had to plug in was your Norelco eletric razor - but in today's modern world, I shouldn't have to choose between charging my iPad or plugging in the television, (even if that television was from 2002 - by far the newest thing in the entire room).  

Don't even get me started on my ""view"".  If they offer you the 3rd floor - run.  My view was of the roof of the casino and the backside of the theater.  It had all the charm of post-war Baghdad.

There was almost no hot water in the shower - but the bathroom sink put out enough steam to fog up the entire room.  The shower head came up to about my chin.  The entire bathroom was mirrored.  Great for some - but an overall disturbing experience for me.

Reasons for my rating: 

* Cold reception at check-in.  Talk about service without a smile!  I couldn't believe that the front desk guy who helped us received employee of the month (as stated on his name tag).  I didn't feel welcome at all, he didn't explain the rates for my stay and only had me sign the slip, and honestly it seemed as if he felt burdened to have to check me in.  When I asked if construction was still going on in the tower, he didn't give a definitive answer and just told me to call the front desk if there was any construction bothering us.  Not a great way to start our stay.

Btw, there was what sounded like drilling going on above us at 9am on the day we checked out.  Luckily, it was not continuous.

* Elevators that didn't work.  One elevator was out of commission on the first day of our stay.  It was back in commission the next day, but once, when we were taking it up to our room, the doors only opened an inch and had to be manually pushed open.  Seriously?  One time there was a crowd of people waiting for an elevator to go up because only one out of the five elevators was working.  And the elevator doors clearly haven't been changed - they were old-looking, dirty, and marked up.

* Wifi was terrible!  One time both devices got booted off and we had to call down to get back on.  Later that night it was working so bad that apps on my phone weren't loading and I just decided to turn the wifi off on my phone.  The next morning the wifi wasn't working on one of the devices, and we had to call guest services yet again to take care of the issue.

* Walls are paper thin.  We could hear the TV in one of the rooms next to us, loud talking, and other sounds you don't want to be subjected to have to listen to, if you get my drift.  Gross.

* Maintenance and housekeeping issues.  The handle for one of the sink drains got stuck and the water in that sink would not drain.  The glasses in the bathroom were not cleaned well and one had a lipstick stain on it.  A toothpick was left on the floor next to one of the beds.  There was black dirt on the hallway floor that had not been cleaned during our stay.  The towels were thin, some of them with thread hanging off.  And there were footprints on one of the ottomans.

* Early check-in fee: I always arrive in Vegas well before check-in time and have never had to pay to check into my room early.  They are sticklers!! The fee is $34.  Also, check-in is later than most other hotels, at 4pm instead of 3.  

* Miscellaneous: The hallway in our room was ridiculously narrow.  (The bedroom and bathroom were roomy enough, though.)  There was a Keurig machine in the room but no k cups to go with it - I called guest services who said that they were in the mini bar and cost $14 for four k cups.  I got insect bites during my stay.  Can I say for sure I got them from the room?  No.  But can I completely rule it out either?  No.

FYI: They have self-service check-in kiosks if you so choose to use them.  Also, if you book through the website, you are sent a link the morning of your arrival to check in online.  If you do, you are supposed to pick up your keys using one of the kiosks.

With a hotel this big and popular they are always going to get lots of customers, so I get the feeling they don't really care about going the extra mile for their guests.  It really is a shame.  I for one do not care to stay in the Julius Tower again.  

The good: Issy with the bell desk who was great when he picked up our bags after we checked out.  He had them ready to go at the ride share pick-up location for when we were ready to head to the airport.

Note: I stayed in their Octavius Tower a few years ago and am not taking that stay into account in this review.  I did not write a review at the time and don't feel I can write the most accurate and thorough review of that tower with all the time that has gone by.",7,0,0

When i arrived, I was told at the check-in that i need to pay additional $50 for two nights b\/c i have a pet, BUT i provided the receipt to the front desk that I already paid for that with the room that i reserved (Pet-Augusta Tower). the room that i reserved already includes the pet fee but the lady said no..that's not true.

I said..i do NOT know what time b\/c i don't know what my schedule is tomorrow. i have never heard of such requirement.

If you can get a room in Octavius, Augustus, or a renovated Palace room, it will be pretty nice (higher end Westin or JW Marriott level; nice jacuzzi tub).

All the staff I've encountered are friendly. I also basically give people $5 tips for breathing, $10-20 for anything substantial, so that might be a factor.

Valet has gotten a lot slower recently, even with TR Diamond; I think they are forced to park vehicles farther away.

Caesars on-property F&B is basically 50% more than it should be, and 100% more than it would be at a normal place (and 150% more than Chinatown...). Room service and minibar are so expensive that I don't even touch them; the buffet is ok but not great and 2x the correct price, but at least I can skip the line.  Beijing Noodle is the only restaurant I am really happy with inside the core property, although Forum Shops has a lot of good choices.

There really isn't anything special here.  If you want a consistently good hotel and have TR status, this is a good choice, especially for 50-150 casino\/weeknight rates.

We stayed here for my friend's 21st birthday.

What I will say, before I say anything good, is that it is very easy to get lost in here.  This place is massive.  We, in fact, did get lost on the way to our rooms.  But once you know where your room is located, you're good to go.

I didn't eat at any of the restaurants here and I didn't gamble, so I can't say much about those things.  But this review is mainly for my experiences with the staff, rooms, and pools.  

Upon walking into the room, I was in shock. There is so much space in these rooms!  I didn't feel crowded in this room at all, even after all of our luggage was spread about the room.  The beds were amazingly comfortable.  I slept like a baby all weekend - and I usually have a very hard time falling asleep.  Lighting in hotel rooms is usually an issue with me, but they had a light in the hallway, two lights by the beds, and a lamp as well.  So I didn't feel like I was sitting in the dark at all times. 

Now onto the bathroom.  Amazing.  Wonderful.  I love a bathroom that four girls can share without feeling the need to elbow each other to get things done.  There was a jacuzzi tub (that all four of us fit in, because we tried it), a long sink with a mirror covering the wall of it, and also the wall of the jacuzzi tub.  The shower is in the corner.. but the door is clear.  So to fix this problem, we hung towels over the door so we could all go in and out of the bathroom without having to worry about seeing lady parts that weren't ours.  The toilet has a separate door, which is even better, because the whole bathroom isn't taken up.  

Room service was thorough and very nice.  The TV was standard, nothing special.  Our view was of the back end of the strip, so I could see Encore.  

Our rooms were right by the pool, so if you go down the elevator, you're just right there.  I LOVE the pools here.  There were so many, and we visited all the ones we could.  We even got into the Venus European Club, but quickly left when we realized, upon entering, that it was a topless club.  I don't like seeing other lady parts.  Mine are fine for me, thank you.

We stuck to the main pool, which was Athena's pool, I believe.  The water temperature was perfect on a hot Las Vegas day in July.  We even got a couple drinks to have while we were in the pool and they definitely hit the spot, but they were very expensive.  

I would recommend staying here, I loved it.  It is a little pricey, but if you have friends that can split the cost, why not?  I will be coming back, if I can.",2,0,0

For one, the Roman and Palace towers are in horrible condition.  If you are not in the Augustus or Octavius towers, forget about it.  The line to check in is just ridiculous.  I've never checked in here and not had to wait an insane amount of time to just get a room.  The Casino is clean (not too horribly smoky) and has a wide variety of games.  Pure is a trendy nightclub that as long as you don't have to wait in line, a lot of fun...just be careful the drink you order as some can surprise you on how expensive they are.  The conference areas are awesome for large or small conventions.  Beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious.  Love the rooms with the jacuzzi and shower separate.  The price of coffee, alcohol, or basically anything you'd get in your room (movies, room service, food of any kind) is crazy expensive.  Guess that's how they get you though.  Food wise, the buffet was back open but I didn't get an opportunity to go there.  The places I did dine in the casino were Serendipity 3 outside the entrance and the little market place by the shops.  Piece of pizza was almost $8, but by far the cheapest thing around.  The food at Serendipity was awesome, but if you can eat it all on your own, you need a medal.  Great to split with a friend (or make one while you are there).

I stayed in the Palace Tower. While Wikipedia claims the tower opened in 1998, it is a mixture of bad interior design ideas from the 80's and cheap renovations from a decade ago. The tower itself is filthy, with stains, trash, and cigarette butts scattered everywhere. My room smelled musty and old. There were water stains on the ceiling and the wall paper was peeling. The carpet had visible stains, which is impressive considering it is designed to hide them. The shower had body hair stuck to the tiles and the spa tub was broken - in hindsight, this was probably a good thing because who knows what would have shot out of those jets. 

My associates and I were granted vouchers to use at restaurants in order to get a discount on our meals. At Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, the waiter (and manager) acted like they didn't understand how to cash the voucher in. We wrote it off as a fluke and went on our way. It happened again at Rao's, and we decided it was strange that no one could cash the voucher. When it happened at Searsucker we came to the conclusion that the staff is trained to play stupid when it comes to these food vouchers. It seems like a nice idea, doesn't it? How nice of the staff to give us a voucher! Too bad it's not meant to be used!

I think it would be best to allow Caesar's Palace to fade into the century that spawned it. The decor of the hotel\/casino is an acid-laced flashback to the 1960's and I could go on and on about the stench of the place, but I would like to keep this somewhat brief. I just pray that I never have to return to this abyss of bad life choices and suffering.",3,5,0

They have several upscale restaurants and you must check out the Forum Shops. Be prepared to do lots of walking even just to get to your room because this place is huge!  We stayed in the Julius Tower and it was okay, basic nothing fancy but it was super clean which is most important to me. If I had to complain of one thing it would be the limited cocktail service on the casino floor which lately seems to be the norm for all Caesars casinos.  You can easily wait an hour and not see one cocktail server (another way they are screwing you this plus the tightening of their machines!) which is why I usually play elsewhere.",2,1,1

Originally i had been booked in the older tower, Roman, but when i checked in the lady at the front desk told me i was being upgraded to one of the new towers for free.  (Umm, hi, you're my new bestfriend).  I think that set the tone for the rest of my stay.  Caesar's has done a lot of additions\/remodeling since the last time i was in Vegas, and the rooms in their new towers are very nice.  I had a huge room on the 18th floor overlooking the pool, im sorry, 5 pools, with a bathroom that not only included a jacuzzi tub, but could probably house about 20 bodies -- im pretty sure my voice echoed in there.

Its definitely a big hotel.  With all the different towers, wings, and the forum shops, one could easily get lost and turned around multiple times.  Even i couldnt find my way to my room on a couple occasions, mix in alcohol, and you might as well send a search party.",2,2,2

This is one of the nicer casinos on the strip with clean and big rooms.  The beds are comfortable and they generally upgrade you to a room equipped with a jacuzzi for free.  Plenty of lights and mirrors to facilitate our vanities.

One complaint is there's always a long line for check-in because they take 15 minutes per person to check in for some odd reason.  That's just unacceptable.

The buffet serves the same things as most buffet except it is relatively cheaper and no line.  I only care to eat the king crab legs anyways and the quality of that is the same as other buffets.  I also tried the sandwich at their deli.  They toast it for you if you want it hot.  I was STARVING so it was probably one of the most delicious sandwhich I've ever had.

I let it go and just kept my comments to myself . It didn't stop there, as we waited for our plates she kept looking at us and making comments and laughing. As soon as our plates were done she just called our name and threw the plates down, didn't even bother to check the receipts as she was for everyone before us. At that I point I was pissed .

She has affected your business I might only be a little dollar amount to what that business makes a day, but imagine all the other people who have dealt with her and have decided to never spend money there again.

With foreign parents, its often difficult for them to communicate to the English Speaking people of ""Las Vegas"". Guess who serves as the translator?  So, I'll share my insights. They have something called ""Diamond in a Day"" where if you accumulate around 5,000 tier credit points you get the Diamond Card. Now this is awesome if your cranky and don't want to wait for the taxi or buffet line at the resort (perks of diamond). Its also handy if for some odd reason, such as  you get a hangover and forget your in Vegas and have an insatiable craving to work out, you can get into the Fitness Gym for free (Which is awesome)

Now for the room, we always stay in the Octavius Tower, mind you, is Awesome! The beds are extremely comfy, decor top notch, and you get a nice view of the pool downstairs. I hear the price of the room in Octavius is pretty pricey, but we always get COMPED. 

Other than getting drunk and wasted at the many bars, what else can you do?
The Pools, they have 7 pools which are open during the summer and 1 pool that's open year round. Its Awesome, the water is crystal blue complemented with the authentic roman floor decor and surrounding statues make you really believe that your in ancient Rome. Its a nice temporary escape from the fact that you just lost thousands in the casino. They have nice seats for you to sunbathe and free towel service. The only downside is that the beds surrounding the pool are EXPENSIVE.  

Overall, the hotel itself is top notch. If you're in the Total Rewards program, this is the best hotel that is in the program. So the next time you're deciding to gamble millions, remember to choose Caesars.",3,4,2

The buffet at Ceasars Palace is the reason I was reluctant to try buffets when I first traveled to Vegas. The buffet here is the epitome of why I fear buffet style served food. 

I went to this place for dinner and it was the worst buffet I've been to in Vegas so far. It was very small. Not a lot of selection. And everything was terrible. We're talking cafeteria lunch terrible. I kept trying things in the hopes I would find something that was at least decent. Alas, everything was bad. How do you mess up pasta and tomato sauce? How do you mess up cookies and chocolate cake? Ugh. 

Given the fact that new buffets are springing up all the time in Vegas, I definitely will never come back here.",3,0,0

Negotiates: I upgraded the room only to be on the first floor and a view of nothing, I told the cleaning staff and called the front desk because the coffee maker was broken no response, the pit bosses were always on the dealers about correct dealing( 25 year employees), I was helped at the kiosk checkin but was given poor directions actually had to ask a staff member, the last morning of the trip we were woke to maintenance drilling or something outside the room at 7 am. I think they lost sight of who actually makes them money, is the customers and the employees that perform the services. So from one business owner to another "" put together a task force to brainstorm on do you have the correct directional focus"".  I mean how much money have you lost because a dealer isn't using their left hand to deal and right to cover the bottom card????

It usually is pricy but I scored a $99 per night reservation.  Upon arrival, I found out the hard way that self parking is on the opposite side of where the lobby is.  Soooo be ready to walk through the whole casino with your luggage to check in at the front desk or check in your baggage at the Bell Desk.  

By the afternoon, I was ready to check in but upon arriving, I didn't see any sort of lines being formed.  Unlike other casinos, Caesar's didn't have the DIsneyland queue where people line up to check in.  So lines were just being formed randomly behind every front desk person that they had.  Not exactly the most organized way as I was able to score a short line while I saw another person standing 5 deep.

The room was pretty good from the Forum Tower.  The room is a bit older but had a good view of the West Vegas side facing Rio and the Palms.  The shower had the ""rain"" faucet and the bathroom mirror had a little TV inside.  Unfortunately the TV was on the outside and not where the toilet was.  Boooooo!  

Caesar's location on the Strip and proximity to other casinos made it a pleasant place to stay despite the horrendous triple digit temperatures that I had to deal with.

Caesars is one of the best hotels on the strip. Their customer service is awesome. They accommodate to your every need and are quick too. 
The rooms are great! Spacious and clean with bathrooms that have almost anything you need (toothbrush, razor, mouth wash...). The tubs are awesome! They come with jets so it's like a mini jacuzzi in your room. Getting a room with a view is totally worth it. We had a view of the pool during our trip. 
The pool is my favorite part. There is a large pool that's perfect for lounging in (nobody really swims). There are several smaller pools scattered. There is also the Venus pool which is 21+ and is more of a party pool. Be sure to go early on Saturdays if you want a chair. People take their tanning seriously and there's hardly any space available after 11. 
Lots of dining and drinking options too! There's bars and restaurants everywhere. A bit pricier than other hotels but the food is good.

The concierge and the staff are a dream- completely dedicated to your experience.  However when you get to the room in the palace tower its a little downhill.

On the second day there, a large piece of wood that was covering the pipes on the sink fell off and got my foot (ouch) I quick phone call to the desk promised a speedy repair but we saw no such thing - left 3 days later having had to step around a large board in the bathroom.  Down the hall to purchase a water from the vending machine rewarded me with a machine that took my money and rewarded me with gushing ice cold  water from the bottom of the machine and over my feet.

We were with a convention so we did not have a choice on hotels.  Next time I book the Mirage or MGM.  Have been much happier at both of those in the past.

Given we had such a great experience that night, we met friends before going out to various shows the very next night.  Unfortunately, it was just not the same.  We could barely get a drink, they didn't ask what kind of olives we wanted and they didn't bring us snacks like they had the last night.  So the difference in service was sad. We wondered around, played a few slot games, and walked over to another bar area, only to receive one of the least tasty martinis I have ever had.

Gambling was slightly annoying. We played slots, roulettes, and blackjack. I don't know about you but I am suspicious of their systems. We only played blackjack four times, and all in a row. Of those four times, I got 20 twice. Dealer beat me every time. Why? He got 21 three times. That's freakin' bull. Roulette was decent (machine version). However lost 3 in a row because I bet on black (after 4 reds first) and got 7 reds in a row. When I decided to not bet on black was when the ball ended up in a black number immediately (spin #8).",1,4,0

This place is huge, so if you're interested in staying in a happening area of town with TONS to do inside and outside of your hotel, this is the place for you!

It said it was 100% smoke free, but it had such a strong odor that I had a headache all night from it inside of my room! The room was a bit dirty and looked like it was not vacuumed before we arrived. There was even an old cigarette laying beside our door inside (which probably explains the smoke smell!). There are not many options for tv if you're looking to relax in your room and watch some tv (I get it, not a ton of people come to Vegas to watch tv, so it's not a huge deal. I'm just covering all my bases here). There was no microwave in the room, which was a bit frustrating. I won't be staying here again because of the smells, lack of cleanliness, and lack of convenience. But if you are barely going to be in your room, it could be alright!

I stayed here because they have a better than average reputation and I got a great rate when booking together with my airfare on Yahoo Travel. Plus upon my arrival they upgraded me despite it being a convention week and the hotel being full.

And I was not disappointed in my choice. The staff is great. The location is in the middle of the strip. There are plenty of varied food and shopping options. My room was in the Forum Tower, a little bit of a haul from main entrance but the room was big and nice.

Spent a grand for 3 nights, okay my lesson learned.  Here's the information so you don't have to learn the same lesson too.

Let's start at the beginning:  Filling the lobby with stale  cigarette smoke from non-guests, who obviously stay at other much cheaper hotels, and then venture here at night to lose their money at your establishment while paying money to play basic atari quality video games. Actual tables like the type youv'e seen in movies are long gone from Ceasar's Palace.  Instead, almost all games are silly and confusing video poker games being played by silent groups of ninety year olds.

Basic navigation upon checking in hotel is blocked by non-hotel guests playing deafening video games which they can't afford and filling the air with toxic and noxious fumes.  Furthermore, this style of videogame gambelling removes all human interaction from the three step process of you losing your money.

 As a guest of the hotel,  I was desperately trying to find a way to check in, so that I could then literally run to my room and bag up my clothes like a smoke inhalation victim.  The lobby is impossible to navigate on purpose because at night it fills up with gambling ""bar flies"". Incidentally,  for those of you who would to receive a complimentary venereal disease then please do just introduce yourself to one of the filthy poorly dressed ruffian as a real live guest of the hotel and the rest will be handled per local custom.

Next:  they are aware of all of trash that stumbles in each night, but the hotel makes no effort at having policies on minimum number of teeth or suitable attire. They need a corridor or a separate lobby for actual hotel customers to navigate on a basic level, but will not find this on any map.  My stay was dominated by how do I plan and manuvre to exit the lobby and get to the services without needing to be treated for smoke inhalation. 
 
***Also, do NOT valet.  You have to wait while nervous non hotel customers smoke and scream\/argue about how much money they've lost at the video poker games.

Finally, although I was on a nonsmoking floor (60)...you guessed it, you could smell smoke.  Perhapse they could also explain the ashtray and matches that came free with my nonsmoking room.  For GOD'S sake, just tell the truth. My eyes, nose, and throat were upset for almost the entire length of my trip.

POOLS:  The pools were nice, but they close in the late afternoon\/evening.  You should consider a cabana which runs $250-$1000 per day.  Or only use the pool in the morning until 11am and again from 3:30pm to 5pm.  There is smoking at the pool, but you can take a dip, exchange the towels, and move locations away from the cigar smokers around you.  Ninja skills preferred, but not required.  The food is also good at the pool.  Spent almost all day, every day out there.

ROOM SERVICE:  Service fee $10 per person and an 18% mandatory gratuity already added to the bill.  Menu is alright, pretty much the same food from the pool, but it will be about $40 more than if you had bought it at the pool.

HOUSEKEEPING:  Very nice, polite, through, all the things you want from customer service staff.

ROOM:  fine, bit cluttered with useless furniture and no rack for your luggage bags.  No robes, a little odd.  Bed fine, TV fine, but WIFI is another $35 a day, really? Yes, really.

Overall, it's a dinosaur from the past with no eyes on the future. This place will not be here in fifteen years. I love the direction Vegas is going, but this is looking to go the way of the STARDUST.",1,4,1

I arrived around 8 PM on a Saturday night and trying to get in to Caesar's was a madhouse. This is a popular casino and the lines into valet were ridiculous. I couldn't even find a sign pointing to self-parking. I was eventually able to valet since I was checking in. Visitors who weren't hotel guests were directed to self park by the valet.

The hotel registration desk was close to the entrance, which was nice. I hate when I have to walk through half the casino before I even check in. The line was short and the wait wasn't too long. The clerk upgraded me for no extra charge to a suite-style room in the same tower as the conference I am attending.

The room is not at all over the top like the rest of Caesar's. It is well-appointed and aesthetically-pleasing. I wasn't sure it was going to work out for me since it is a smoking-optional room, but they do a good job with ionizing it between guests and it is nearly impossible to tell that someone smoked in here in the past.

The bed is super comfortable (I am in it now, posting this before I go to bed) and they have wireless internet available in the rooms.

Updated:
I never received my bill in the mail after using the in-room check-out. I called the reservation line and was given a different number to call. After selecting the appropriate options, I was led to a recording giving me yet another number to call. I called that number, went through the options and was put through to a line that just rang and rang and rang. I tried every option on that system with the same results. I called every 15 minutes for a couple hours and never got a person on the phone or even a voicemail box. I had to submit my expense report using a copy of my credit card statement.",0,0,0

I couldn't be more disappointed!!!
The hotel is very fancy, and the rooms are very nice, spacious, and clean. Although, too fancy for my taste: those free snacks in the room that you get charged for just by moving them (remember The Hangover?) are just annoying! You're worried about breathing too close to them...
The new tower has floors 23-36 (our section) with 4 elevators; only one operated. You have to wait 15-20 minutes to get into an elevator, each way.
The service was... what service?!! It was sooo bad! beginning with the front desk that told us to come back for checkin in 1 hour, and when we came back in 2 hours the room still wasn't ready. Lago buffet - good luck getting a drink order; we had to wait about 20 minutes for a waitress, and even asked a few workers for coffee, while ignored by all.
Munch bar, which will get its all glorious review, messed up our order, made us wait 25 minutes for our food (when 3 tables that sat after us got theirs already) and compensated us with a free beer. We can get free beer at the casino all day long!!!
Finally, the hotel is super huge! it takes forever to walk from one part to the other. it's a 15 min hike from our tower to the pool, and another 10 min to get the towels. 
Oh and last but not least, the day of the checkout the maid knocked on our door at 9am. I thought it was a universal rule that the day of checkout you don't clean the room until after the people, well, checked out... and who wakes people up in Vegas at 9am anyway?!!!

Honestly. We had a wonderful experience. We stayed in the forum tower the first 5 nights in an executive suite. Since we were working for joblo.com we relied heavily on internet speed to get out content online. The internet was super spotty in our room which posed a bit of problem for work. We managed by using the assigned press room. The entire event was catered by properties on site and everything was excellent. 
We stayed an extra 2 days and had to switch rooms (no big deal). We went to check into out new room and people were still sleeping in it. The front desk was super great about making up for it and upgraded us to a suite in the palace tower. No complaints at all in our new room. Nothing was damaged or dirty as others mentioned.
The elevators get breaking in forum tower during our conference which was frustrating waiting on 2 during peak times.
The pool was wonderful (tip- get beers in the sundry shop next to the pool to save cash).

I've always had a good experience every time I go to this club. I have yet to try Poetry, and this past Thursday I missed out on seeing that hottie Keri Hilson. The things I would do to that woman... you know like take her on a date and tell her how gorgeous she's looking and that I enjoy her company. Yeah thats the life.

Anyway, another reason I like Caesar's is the Forum Shops. I'm not that big on gambling, but when you're bored waiting for others to meet up with you, the shops are a way to kill time. I know its mostly high end stuff, but its nice to see stores like Express, Gap, the Apple Store, and my personal favorite: Niketown. I can always count on Niketown to have something that catches my eye, yet I have to resist and save my money. 

Reason #3: Fat Tuesday, which is next to Express and Niketown. Treat yourself to a Magnum 44 with a triple shot of Everclear and proceed. 

Reason #4: the Forum shops have a Bank of America ATM located in one of the hallways. If you're a BofA customer and you're trying to avoid withdrawing from a 3rd-party ATM, this has to be great news to you. 

Reason #5: Watching the Roman soldiers-in-costume chase people and eventually take pictures with them. Yessuh. 

Reason #6: Cleopatra's Barge, the floating lounge with complimentary snacks and cougars galore. 

Reason #7: The moving statues show. Way better than that living garden BS at the Palazzo. 

Reason #8: F.A.O. Schwartz and the giant piano you step on to play it. It's even more fun when you're plastered. 

OK, I ran out of reasons. What I don't enjoy is how much of a pain it is to get to self parking. Trying to get here is one of the reasons I try to avoid driving along the Strip as much as possible. I also don't like that the tables usually have $10-$15 minimum bets. I know its Caesar's and all, but if you're a gambler on a budget, it would be nice to have. 

If you like Elton John, Bette Midler, and Cher, you might like it here too. I'll update my review when I get around to staying here for a night or two, but for now, Caesar's is pretty solid.",5,1,3

1. I do not travel very often, but when I do, I usually stay in hotels such as the Holiday Inn or Residence Inn. At this hotel, although notorious for its location, size, and casino, I was not so pleased to stay in a room with no microwave, fridge, paper copy of TV network listings, or a complimentary breakfast. Yes, I know that with its size, some of those amenities are not practical, but that definitely changed my view on the hotel itself. The bathroom didn't even have a hair drier like most other hotels. 
2. This place was crazzzzzzy expensive. I get it, it's on the Las Vegas Strip, it's big, and it's a part of a casino. But dang... Close to $300 for one night in a standard two bed room. Nothing was spectacular about the room either... Bland walls, and like I previously mentioned, lack of amenities. 
3. Do NOT bring your children here. Too much smoke in the casinos to just get to the elevator and to your room. I'm a young adult, and still could not breathe in all of the cigarette smoke. I don't know how parents found it okay to drag their children through all of that... 
4. Maybe I'm just not as fascinated by the buzzing lifestyle of Vegas, but if I knew that my experience would result in a stiff bed, poor functioning shower head, walls that I can hear through, and (like I cannot get over) lack of amenities, I would've have wasted my time.

Why do I stay at Caesars?  Yeah, 'cuz the conference is there.  Although I would prefer to stay at Vdara, the Aria, the Cosmopolitan, even the Wynn or -- sigh -- the magnificent Mandarin Oriental, Lynn and I frequently stay in the Palace Tower at Caesars because you can roll out of bed, roll downstairs, and into a seminar . . . it IS convenient.

On the other hand, the former Emperor of the Strip is smokey, loud, and showing its age.  In the rooms, this (or that) doesn't work, this is damaged or ""dinged,"" and the bed is about as comfy as the one found in a Motel 6.  

You have a choice:  pay $12 for the K-kups of coffee in the room (with powdered fake cream), or go down to the lobby and get a latte and croissant at François Payard's place.  So, it's down to the lobby in the elevators -- walk the (seeming) half-mile to Payard's, wait in line, and then back the way I came so Lynn can have some coffee wile getting dressed.  

It's convenient:  you can get off the elevators in their convention center -- that way you only have to (seemingly) walk halfway back to California to get to the ballroom where the conference is being held -- instead of down to the lobby, walk the half-mile to Payard's, across to the escalators and back up to the conference floor and the trek to Barstow . . . . 

And of course, since the restaurants at Caesars are not my first choice, you have to go down the elevators, walk the half-mile to Payards, then the extra mile through the smokey casino and noisy slots to the front door, stand in the l-o-n-g taxi line with people carrying those three-foot high plastic containers filled with once frozen margaritas, and hope the line moves quickly enough that you aren't late for dinner . . . .

OK, the spa is nice.  And there's now a Christian Laboutin store in the Forum Shops.  

But the wi-fi and cell reception in the conference center is dicey at best, which makes it difficult (to say the least) to work\/stay in touch with the office while you're at the conference -- and that's kind up important for a Criminal Defense Attorney, don't you think?

Bad news:  next year's conference is also at Caesars, and -- against my will and better judgement -- we'll probably be back . . .

This dinosaur of a casino is actually a lot nicer and more modern than what I was expecting. The suite I was staying at overlooked the pools and was located in the Palace Tower, which is one of the newer towers (the Palace Tower opened in 1997, while the Augustus Tower opened in 2005 I think). The size of the suite was roughly the same, if not larger, than a standard suite at the Palazzo. But, the bathrooms are much nicer. There were 2 bathrooms (his and hers) with a 2 person shower with 2 shower heads joining them. The smaller bathroom consisted of a sink and toilet, while the larger bathroom had a toilet and bidet, sink, and hot tub. The suite was tastefully decorated with modern furniture. The king-size bed was comfortable but a little softer than I prefer. The view from the 11th floor was decent -- overlooking their pools, but there's not much else to see except the other towers and I-15. My only complaints are that the hot tub was extremely loud (like having a lawn mower in the bathroom) and it took close to 10 minutes for the hot water to kick-in with the showers. Other than that, the suite was amazing. It was a little bit of a hike from the parking garage and the signage could be improved but it's well worth the trip. Caesar's has done a good job staying relevant all these years among the mid- to top-tier hotels in Vegas. Although their clientele is definitely a mixed bag of high-rollers and some... um... not-so-high-rollers... and everything in between. They may not be in the same class as Wynn\/Encore or the Bellagio, but they're a good option if you're looking for a hotel one or two steps down from that.",1,0,1

Worse, the bathroom had been used - towel on the floor, wet sink, open tube of soap or lotion. They said sorry, although we requested non-smoking, they could not guarantee it. They could, however, run an ozone machine there for an hour, but we would have to be out of the room. It was near 11:00 PM and we were exhausted from our trip already. They insisted no other rooms were available. But we insisted that we could not stay in that room, especially since it didn't look like it had been properly cleaned, and that they speak to their manager, after which another room magically appeared.

It was a bigger room with two bathrooms sharing a common shower, so that was nice. But you could see it was falling apart. The toilet flush handle would get stuck and keep flushing. Water leaked out of the shower stall door. The shower heads put out fine needles of water, mildly uncomfortable.  The bidet water pressure was too low for use. The TV had the wrong aspect ratio set (which we could not unset). But it was better than the ""smokehouse"". Our room at the Venetian was more updated, with motorized shades\/curtains and a real sitting room.

The main attraction (apart from their new spa, for $45) is their pool area, which was very windy that week, but still ok when the sun was shining. If you like sunbathing, it's a nice area. But there was a soda can floating in the center pool. Gym is $25\/day.

Restaurants there are Vegas-priced, expensive, but you can get a set lunch for about $24. Best deal is the food court burger for about $6 (using free Total Rewards card). Also great BBQ there. Lobster roll not much lobster, though everything there is cooked well.

First off the place is massive, just flat out huge, multiple restaurants, multiple bars and of course an assortment of slots and table games for your gaming pleasure.

The pool area is magnificence; I believe there are good 7 or 8 different pools for your swimming and also ogling pleasure.  Chairs are on a first come, first serve basis, so get out there early to snag the prime locations.

The room I stayed in was amazing, probably bigger than my apartment, huge King size bed, a couch and two arm chairs.  The bathroom alone was a prize, huge walk in shower with dual showerheads, a huge Jacuzzi tub that could comfortable fit two or more people. Two separate toilets in two different rooms and also a bidet and nothing says classy hotel like a bidet.

The only downsides are that it is super pricey, 8 dollars for an aluminum bottle of Miller Lite at the pool side bar is a bit extreme. 25 dollars for a Long Island ice tea poolside. Everything is way more than it should be but then again it is Vegas and on the strip, so you should know what to expect.

The TV was acting very bizarre, the channel would randomly change to the menu screen several times by itself and then it would be impossible to change the channel off of the menu screen.  Finally called down to the front desk and they were able to reset the TV but then the TV would no longer turn on, called again and they sent someone to replace the batteries, they seemed to fix the issue but it was still an annoying situation.

Also for some reason I was standing on the side of the tub and noticed that the paint was chipping in the ceiling above the mirror, come on Caesars you're a classy establishment, you've got to be more through with your upkeep.

Still wonderful hotel and definitely looking forward to a return visit.

It has been featured in countless movies from Rain Man to Casino to The Hangover.  This used to be the hotel to be seen in and in all honesty is making a big come back.  Caesars is old but they have expanded and modernized the entire property a number of times.  It also goes to mention that the Resort Property is absolutely HUGE.  The pools, the restaurants, the glamor,  and the shows are still first class.  

The rooms have all been redone and are very nice now.  They did a great job in making everything modern looking with decor and amenities.  The Forum shops are still the best in my opinion with all the Designer names mixed in with upscale stores.  This hotel is always full with a good mix of people.  I bumped into Jay-Z (literally), NBA stars, actors etc here throughout the years.

The High Roller reputation that his Casino holds has been earned and solidified for decades.  It has over the top Roman decor but has kept up with modern times surprisingly well.  It can be intimidating gambling here as more fortunes have been won and lost here than anywhere  else in the world.

If you are a VIP this is still a top 5 hotel, if you gamble especially poker you will be in heaven, and if you are a high roller you will be treated like Caesar here.",1,0,0

My boyfriend and I booked through Expedia prior to our visit at the Caesars Palace. We were told that we were staying in the Roman Tower but upon checking in at 6pm there were none available so (I believe) the clerk upgraded us for free because we got to our hotel room and it was actually a 2-room suite with a living room, HUGE walk-in closet, big screen TV, 2 bathrooms, dining table for 6 people, and plenty of couch space for guests. The best part.. we had a jetted spa, multiple head granite shower and his\/her sink style in our bathroom. Such a gorgeous room-- you will love it! 

We stayed in room 5827 of the Forum Towers, you won't be disappointed if you book this room! 

My only complaint or concern.. when we were checking out they told me I had a $150 balance due. When we went to check what it was for, we found out that it was due to us removing the drinks in the refrigerator for more than 30 seconds. Apparently the fridge is weight censored and they charge you for removing them. We removed the drinks to put our own in, not thinking anything of it. It would have been nice of the clerk to inform us of this policy upon checking in- luckily they removed the charges. 

Also, be wary of your check-out bill. Someone charged $25 to our bill for Starbucks (which I had no idea the hotel even had) the front desk lady said ""were supposed to check ID, and if it matches then we'll charge the room."" Well apparently they didn't check and ID because we never went there once.  Thankfully- they removed this charge as well.


Don't go to the 24-Hour diner by the hotel check-in. It took over 30 minutes for one to go meal and it was cold\/soggy by the time we got it. Not only that but it was $35 for a simple fish and fry meal-- way too overpriced. Mcd's has better food than this!.",3,0,1

TONS of places to shop... and LOTS of sculptures... beautiful Roman sculptures to see...  curved escalators and a little waterfall\/pond inside... outside of the property there are Roman sculptures and waterfalls... it's really a gorgeous property inside and out. 

They also have a free show in front of the Cheesecake Factory called the Fall of Atlantis. Pretty cool show that shows the myth of Atlantis. I think they perform it every hour... and behind the show there's a huge saltwater aquarium with LOTS of different fish. Very pretty!

For me, I visit the Forum Shops every time, the dining and shopping options are fun and a great time suck.

It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain.

He informed me that if I add about $80 or $100 (not sure the exact amount) to my original reservation, I can get a larger suite in the Augustus tower.  I placed the reservation, he sure sold me.  I received an email confirmation that did not give the details of the room I reserved, it simply gave a confirmation # and explained that I can set up a text message service that will provide for a quicker check-in.  I signed up for the text service and I was so excited to use it and know that I can avoid the check-in lines and go straight to the bell desk to pick up my room keys.  

Upon arrival, the bell desk claimed my keys were not ready and to continue to the platinum members line to ensure faster service.  I waited in the platinum members line for over 15 minutes, not one person came to the desk to greet me.  After 45 minutes of what was supposed to be the ""fastest check in""  I was finally greeted by staff who said they will check me in. By the time my reservation was pulled up ( an hour of wait time had passed)  he gave me keys to a regular room.  When I noticed he wasn't directing me to the Augustus Tower as promised, I quickly mentioned that I paid extra for that type of suite.  He questioned me and asked if I had any proof.  I told him when they sent a confirmation email, it says nothing about Augustus, so I have no proof, other than the extra price I paid for the room.  Another 3o minutes pass, several arguements, and a lot of disappointment occurred before the check in attendant finally found my correct reservation. 

This is completely unaccepatble.  I dont understand why Caesar's doesn't automatically send an email confimation including the correct room reservation?  Or why the computer system is not updated correctly.  Either way, after a huge mistake like that happens at the resort's expense, the customer MUST be compensated somehow.  After such a stressful and aggravating check in, I went up to the room to settle in.  Only to find dirt and nasty body hair all over my bathtub! I had to clean my own tub before I got in.  This entire experience was very disappointing and unsettling.  I called management and notified them of my experience.  They took $100 off my reservation, which did not solve the problem or satify me one bit.

Ceasars is 1 of the best Harrahs properties by far in Vegas. The rooms were nice, the restaurants we ate at were all good and the pools are really nice. The only negatives I remember was that they don't provide a fridge in your room unless you pay 20$\/day...bu11sh1t! They also check your bags when going to the pool so you don't bring any food or beverages...although I guess that's common at the nicer places. Overall, I would def recommend staying here!

fast forward 10 something years, i finally kept the promise last weekend.  10 girls checked into a 2 bedroom , 2 story suite, and when we opened the double door, our jaw dropped.  a grand piano, a whirlpool bath tub, a wet bar, marble floors, huge rooms, a livingroom and even a bidet...it was absolutely amazing.  we used every single amenity (played piano when we were sober and threw ourselves into the tub when we were drunk).  i know this hotel is a little outdated compared to wynn and bellagio, but it just has the old charms and grandioso vibes.  what a comeback story this is...

I am a diamond member, which means free rooms etc. Each stay you can see the hotel is sliding further down the abyss.  I'll write it out point by point should the management be reading, which I doubt but anyway..

1. We booked months in advance to stay in the Augustus Tower only to be told (literally) by the desk that they moved us so they could accomodate the Asian guests. Seriously. Got pushed to the way back of the hotel which really the room was fine, it's the principal of it. 

2. Qua.  Sad. This used to be spectacular.  It varied in price from $45 to $100 if you were not a hotel guest. If you were a hotel guest it was up to 2 people for $25 dollars. Plus if you were a diamond it was free a few years ago, then crept up to $25, then $30.   That's what I mean by ""nickel and diming"" .  $5 will make that much of a difference to you???   It doesn't to me, but it feels skanky.

-  This last visit to Qua, I brought 5 people. We paid and went in.  In the ladies side, in the Roman baths, the lights were on full tilt. this means bright, under the microscope lights.  I went and mentioned it, the girl at the desk was a wet noodle and basically hemmed and hawed and said the maintenence guys had left the lights on high. No, she didn't offer to fix it.  I've been to QUA maybe a hundred times, the whole point is dim lights, candles, soothing music. Not lights up like on a Broadway stage.  At this point, I got really annoyed and said ""don't worry, I'll go handle it myself"".  In my robe I marched out of the spa and to the Spa Desk and told them the situation.

Next.  I'm back sitting in the pool putting up with the bright lights trying to decide what to do. A spa employee comes up, and i kid you not, says  ""we'd like to offer you a full refund it you leave, and a half refund if you stay"".  Seriously?  I'm a diamond status guest, and you are telling me that?   I told the employee  ""what you should be saying is  We're really sorry about the situation, let us treat you to today's spa experience""  and give me my $30.   I gamble a hundred times that a day, for them to offer me $15 was beyond funny.

Then.  They are elminating the special valet on the side of the Augustus tower, which was amazingly convenient. One of the valet guys said it was so they could let a few of them go.

Caesar's is done.  I would rather pay moving forward to stay somewhere with a sense of pride in what they're doing than stay there for free.  Contrast with the Cosmo where the employees seem to genuinly love what they're doing, and treat the guests with respect.",3,1,1

Now every time I stay @ Caesars, I book for only the Augustus Tower.  Private checkin' and entrance are there for Diamond players.  Beautiful rooms, 550 sqft. standard.  Better in person then in pictures.  Nice comfortable white beds.  Plenty of lighting, unlike several Vegas hotels.  LCDs are Sony... big plus!  Nothing much bad to say about property except for it being so huge.  Staying in other towers is a b*tch to get to.  Not only is it far from the front entrance, it's easy to get lost.  Too many nook and cranny and seperate pathways.  Palace towers is one of the worst to get to.  Stayed in a room there once and almost always forgot how to get to the elevators. 

Beautiful pool areas... can't say the same of eye candy.  More of the ""mature"" folks are here.  

The only Vegas property that has two separate casino areas.  I don't like how they take commission right away for winning hands at the table games.  Wished high limit area was more secluded.... then again, I would love it more if I won there.

Forum Shops, best shopping destination for lovers of designer labels.   Almost every major player has a boutique there... LV, Gucci, Balenciaga, Ferragamo, etc.  Just wished Prada and Dior Homme set up shop there instead of having to jaunt over to Bellagio and Wynn, respectively.

We valet parked ( taking parents to ramsays. ) closer to the planet Hollywood area and not alot of sign age direction to casino we got lost about 4 times and was about ready to head out. While yes there is a directory they need to change the sign color or something either have the business in side the casino separate plaque or have single Large signs directing  you to the casino.

Also the casino floor layout is bad -- i.e 1 $ 2$ slot games mixed in with 25 cent and penny slots, and then realizing after you go past the pus.cat doll poker room or what ever that was that there is a complete penny room adjacent from the exit room. 

We nearly walked to whole back side of that casino and ramsay's is tucked all the way in the back we where thinking about going to another restaurant due to the fact. 

Me personally I wont be back the casino floor was really tight on a Friday -- I didn't win nothing not even a dickie bird ha.

I didn't care for their method of check-in. I received an email the day before, saying I could check-in online, and I did. The reply email stated I would receive an email telling me where to go to pick up the keys when the room was ready. Check-in time was 3pm, and if the room was ready earlier, they would also let me know. There I was in the check-in line at 3:15, never receiving an email. 

Also, their check-in line is more like grocery store check stand lines, not like most other hotels with one long line. This way is more unfair, as the people in front of me took too long to service, and I watched a lot of people who came after me, leave with their room keys before I even got to the counter. And talk about no sympathy from the clerk. I guess They must hear it all the time,  ""I didn't get an email. This line took so long, I wish I was in the other line.""

But why only 1 star? Though just bad luck, the hot water system broke down and I was unable to bathe on the first night there. Yes, it was important for me to get clean before going to bed and I couldn't, so I had to go to sleep feeling dirty.

Still, why the knock? Well, when I called to ask about the hot water, though I did get an apology and an unfortunate, ""we don't  know when it will be repaired,"" I felt I, and the rest of the guests who complained, should have been compensated in some way.

She told me I had to call the number on the back of the card, so I did. They told me that they couldn't help me either and I had to call still another number to get help.  At that point I told her I was done wth the Ceasar properties. Now, I'm not a bad gambler, I.e. I don't loose thousands at a time unlike those who seem to get wasted and get tons of service while they gamble (and who,BTW, are totally rude and disruptive to the other pleyers without any comments from the pit bosses) and I typically walk out of a casino with at least what I walked in with or just a little less, and I play the higher value tables.

Sure enough 14th floor Palace Tower looks directly over their parking garage, and if you have good vision you can see the mountains in the daytime in the distance (if it's clear out). 

Because we need a fridge for medication, when a we get a knock on our door not 2 minutes after walking in, we are surprised to find maintenance there asking if we have a clogged toilet. What??? So, we flush the toilet, seems to work fine so no clog. Little did we know that it wasn't clogged, it just didn't seal and refill. So, had to call maintenance back later that evening and wait for them to come fix it. Of course they didn't have the right parts, so several trips later it was fixed. 

This room was a mess, not from poor cleaning, that was exceptional! The gold faucet was peeling off, the shower leaked everywhere and had a teeny quarter round shelf that had a hole in the center and dipped down to drain for holding toiletries. Most of our things were on the floor. 

Lights were either out or blinking on or off constantly, even after they were changed. 

Then there was the TV which went fuzzy, and lost reception constantly. You missed portions of what was going on of whatever you were watching. 

WIFI was horrible, and if you signed up for theirs, very expensive.

There was a Keurig machine in the room, but unless you brought your own K-cups it was $13.00 for 4 cups and whatever else they included in the box (I'm assuming it was sugar, cream and stir sticks) but didn't want to be charged to open it.

And, every time you left your room, you had to walk past very rude sales people asking you to try their products. After saying ""No Thank You"" more than a dozen times, we finally just ignored them. I don't like that behavior at the mall, and I didn't like it at Caesars'.

I was apprehensive about coming here because I've heard things about how campy and outdated they are.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there's an awful fountain of naked muses in the lobby right when you enter, and there are similarly bad imitations of Classical sculpture everywhere in the hotel, but it's Vegas, so that's to be expected!  I was there for a conference and my employer had already pre booked everything.  The check in staff were very pleasant and offered a tempting upgrade to a better room for a mere $30 a day.  I waffled, then agreed to the offer.  When I got to my room, I was stunned--what a great bargain! It wasn't the largest room in the world, but it was around 500 sq. ft, VERY ample space.  The decor did not make my eyes hurt.  The bathroom was huge and had a TV as well as a jacuzzi tub.  And it only came for $30 more!  I slept very well--it was quiet and the air smelled clear (rare in Vegas).

The conference center was also a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and large.  It was hard to get to from my rooms though.  And it was so big I got lost.  

The casino was average--seemed a bit empty, but the economy had just tanked when I was there (October 2008).  The one restaurant we went to, Rao's was good but pricey.  I think they were trying to capitalize on their reputation as one of the hardest restaurants to book in New York.  I'm still very much an MGM Grand fan when it comes to restaurants, though.  Maybe I am limited, but it just seems easier and more dependable, since they've managed to amass just about every noteworthy chef on the face of the earth over there.

My colleagues were a bit annoyed with the catering staff at this hotel for our business luncheon, and I must say that they were pretty rude to her regarding her gluten allergy.

I could safely assume that this room was located in the Augustus tower. When we checked in, I confirmed it with the receptionist.  This tower has more updated fixtures and furniture. It was a good sized room with a great view of the strip and fountain. I enjoyed the room.

What i didnt like was the parking. The structure is a little confusing and you have to walk through the restaurants and casinos to check in & it is a very far walk.

For some reason I feel like their casino is weird\/small. Not a huge fan. I much prefer Planet Hollywood's casino layout. 

I don't recommend the cafe that's attached. Food is ok but service is downright awful. We waited 50 minutes for a table outside when we were told it would only be a few. They updated us every so often which was nice but it was fine, we had drinks we were talking and relaxin. No rush. Walked away for two minutes while someone from our party waited. Came back and I was told they gave our table away because we weren't there. Literally 2 minutes. I was annoyed at that point and told them. They magically Had a table ready. We say down. Waiter comes over 10 minutes later for drinks. Comes back 5 minutes later with drinks. We wanted to order he said to hold on. 15 minutes goes bye so we flag him down, ask for the check, and leave.

She said the most basic room in that tower for tomorrow would be $225 a night after additional taxes and fees. I really just wanted another night at the same price though.. the one I originally paid for. So I told her I'd think about it and went out on the strip for some food and drinks. I come back later that night around 11:30PM or so and talk to another girl so I could figure out my plans for tomorrow and what room I'd be in. She said she sees the quote the other girl gave me and that's the best she could do. I wasn't happy to hear that but I then asked ""well I won't have to wait until 4 to check in right? I'd like to get in a room at 11 when I check out of the other one"". No she said. She then picked up the phone and dialed the supervisor to come out in a murmured voice. The lady supervisor was direct and a little nasty that ""we'll have to see what we have at check in. Can't make you promises"". I was pretty pissed at that point. Never asked for an upgrade, wasn't asking to stay in a penthouse, just wanted a close basic room somewhere close (because moving was already an inconvenience) and I just wanted a basic room at the price they gave me for the first one. I left the counter and figured I'll just find a cheaper hotel on the strip, screw them. Morning came, and I have to say it sucked to leave that beautiful room. I go downstairs in the morning and am checked out by Delano. His charm was there from the start. I felt like he had no attitude and maybe could understand my situation and handle it more professionally than I've been dealt with in the past. So, screw it i asked him too. I really didn't feel like having to leave the hotel, would've been more inconvenient to go. So he listened to me and sprung to action right away. He apologized about the way I was dealt with previously and dialed his manager. He told me ""let me see what I can do"" he briefly explained to his supervisor my ordeal and they were able to give me the same beautiful room that I had for the same price! I thanked him multiple times. The resort needs more employees like Delano. He understands what it is to give exceptional customer service. I even ordered room service and threw a couple rags in the casino. They wouldn't have seen that extra money if it wasn't for Delano keeping me there. Had a great experience and would definitely return regardless of the room I receive!",0,0,0

I read the reviews of the long waits to check in. I tried to this texting sign in and the technology really did not work. So I started frustrated but when I got in there was no wait. I had a friendly person who upgraded me to the 27th floor on the Palace tower one floor away from the suites.

Second the casino and area is beautiful. I really enjoy the area, the shops and the cleanliness of the place. It feels like it remodelled.. 
The service was great. The toilet broke. I think they addressed it right away. I lost my key and they replaced it very quickly. 
The staff were just genuinly friendly.

The price was a little high but Las vegas is just pricey. That is the way it is.

I did not eat there but I think there are a lot of options. I did have a drink at Shadows. It was really nice.

Julius Caesar really didn't live there.
The place is pager friendly but I'm taking cool points away from you to be on the web reading this review with a pager on your hip.
You won't find pay phones here.

I suppose this review is about the gambling experience I had here --- AWESOME. What a really cool place to hangout for the night. From what I understand this place is old but the atmosphere here is amazing. I would have thought that this place was recently built because everything here appears brand new. Everything here is taken care of daily and taken care of well. All things appear brand new to me.

People smoke here but the place doesn't smell like cigarettes. You'll find lots of action going on here even late at night or early in the morning (however you look at it). The dealers at the tables (I'm a craps shooter) are extremely friendly and they made my experience very memorable. You'll find a few different nightclubs here, Pure, being one that I previously reviewed.

One quick funny story. I was here in November 2010 with two friends who wanted to turn $200 into a $1,000 over a few hands of black jack. The dealer, a very old Asian man with a thick accent, spent almost six or seven minutes cutting the cards in front us and didn't say a single word to anyone (I was just watching my friends gamble). I was wondering why the hell it was taking him so long and within five hands and not even five minutes of dealing my buddies were each out $200. I suppose this dealer was trying to provide some sort of experience because dammit Vegas will get you.

I plan on making several more trips in my lifetime to Sin City and will soon not only patronize Caesar's Palace for gambling purposes but for the hotel stay, clubbing and for dining. You must visit this place if you are Las Vegas.",0,0,0

Here on a bachelor party I was going to room with my brother. The other guys decided that they didn't want to share a king size bed and requested for two queens beds instead. My brother and I opted to gamble a little bit and pay for just a king size bed. If the hotel had a room with two queens I figured I come out ahead since I didn't have to pay extras like the other guys did. 

Well...we checked in and I got my king size bed. Figured, ok I'll share with my brother...nothing wrong with that. The other guys...we'll they ended up getting a room with one king size bed. They told the check in girl that they reserved through Expedia and paid extra for the beds. She was nice enough to provide all parties an extra twin bed without any charge. So I guess in a way I got a bed. Didn't have to share with my brother, which again I wouldn't have minded, but it was free, so F it. 

We ended up staying at the Roman Towers, which is the original hotel before they expanded. They are a little worn out, but it's a room, it's clean and had a nice view of the roof tops. But there were no coffee maker in the room. I guess that's the new tread. Funnel you down stairs for coffee that will cost you $8.00 and not the $1.50. 

One problem I have with the room was the toilet. After dropping the kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean, you flush the toilet and it seems like the water rises to the top of the toilet. You think ""man I need to call the front desk to unclog the toilet and they'll ask me to stop eating at White Castle for the rest of my trip...how embarrassing"". Nevertheless the toilet eventually eats up whatever is in there and you stop worrying, for now. 

The pools they have there are nice. Lots of good looking people...some girls in their bikini's and some not so hot in bikini's. Don't worry gentlemen...the cold water will kill off any erections you might have when you stare like a creep at some hot chicks...not that I did that...I'm married. If the cold water doesn't kill it off than the guy walking around in his European Speedos and pierced nipples might kill it. 

Shirts are required when you leave the pool area. If you walk around shirtless or just in your bikini security will come by to escort you to the elevators and tell you that shirts are required on the premises. CP has high standards. 

Overall I thought it was a good experience. It was clean and everything you expect from CP. The employees were helpful when you got lost and the people at the sports book area explain all the questions you have. Most of the games there are pricey, I suggest if your not into the slots but don't want to pay a lot for table games just yet, go to Harrah's or the Flamingo (which are all related to CP anyways). They got cheaper table games there. All you have to do is cross the street...in 100 degree weather...",4,4,3

The resort itself is absolutely gorgeous. we stayed at the Augustus Tower Deluxe King room, and the room itself was very spacey and gorgeous. We got to see the beautiful pool from our view to the left, and part of the strip to the right. The bathroom was huge as well with a nice jacuzzi bathtub next to the shower area. It's definitely a plus that there's a his and hers sink set in the bathroom as well.

There are all types of restaurants in the hotel from Gordon Ramsay's Pub, food court for quick bites, the famous buffet, etc. there's so much to do in the hotel and out of the hotel to keep you busy. If you love shopping stroll around in the shopping area enjoying the ""view"" and their outdoor feel ceilings as well.

I was pretty stoked about getting a great deal on-line for this hotel months before the date of the big fight the same weekend was announced.

CP served its purpose for our visit to Sin City, it provided a clean room, comfy bed and the convenience of it being centrally located on the Strip near all the other spots we checked out over the weekend.

However, if you can have it your way, I'd strongly suggest you request for a room at any other tower than the ROMAN tower.  After waiting in line for fifteen minutes for my check-in (I was next in line by the way), we made our way to our tenth floor room and was quickly bummed out at how aged it was.  From all the pics I viewed on-line, I thought our room was going to have all the modern amenities, but it had none of it.

This is my favorite casino. With a name like ""Spartacurtus,"" you can't blame me. I totally dork out on the scenes carved in the wall by the casino floor. They are straight from a Roman sarcophagus!

I feel like such an imperial conqueror when I come here. After a white wine spritzer or two, it turns into a true Roman bacchanal. 
The scenery here is amazing, and so much fun. A lot of the other casinos don't really have a theme, but these guys do. In full style. 
Everything here meets the Roman eye for beauty. Some of the statues aren't really historically accurate. Michelangelo's David is waay late for Caesar's. But most of the other temple scenes are spot on.

My previous experiences with Caesar's were fine, and I guess this one was too, but I have to say, the Strip has better to offer.

If I'm trying to be brief, I'll just say that I'm sure that it's hard to run an enormous resort hotel on a holiday weekend (Thanksgiving).  However, Caesar's has to pull it together because there's just too much competition!

We stayed in the Palace tower, which has some nicely-sized junior suites with an added amenity that I like, but the rooms aren't renovated.  That's okay, no problem, except that the bed wasn't that comfortable.  Usually I sleep like a baby in hotel beds, so I definitely noticed the difference.

Also, we really struggled to get little problems fixed- a functional bathtub, for instance.  When we asked for robes and slippers, we were essentially told that we hadn't spent enough money for those, as they were reserved for (full) suites.  Whaaaaaa???  I can completely understand not stocking every room with robes, but if a guest asks for one, bring the robe!  Are they kidding?

My other visits to Vegas I had stayed at some of the less fancy hotels on the strip so this place is in a whole other league. Don't get me strong I still like the less fancy hotels and have no problem with them at all but I am saying the atmosphere is way different. Everything at Caesars is much more expensive so if you eat at the restaurants there the entire time prepare to spend a pretty penny on food. That pretty much goes for buying anything there. The mini bar in my room wanted $12.00 for plain M&Ms, lol. Just a fair warning. Ok now time for the details. 

Check in was a breeze. My cab driver dropped me off at the VIP entrance because it was quicker and easier to get to and he was very cool like that. I was not sure where to go from there to check in so I went to the VIP desk there and they went ahead and checked me in instead of sending me to the main desk in the front. It was a very quick and painless check in which I can always appreciate. The lady at the front desk was very polite and she called a bellhop right away to take my bags up to my room. My room was in the Forum Tower room 6504. It was quite a ways from the desk where I checked in. Instead of sending me of into the unknown to get lost the bellhop David very kindly walked me and my bag to my room. He was very sweet the entire time and he have me a tour of the place as we walked to my room. That ended up being very helpful because I didn't get lost once after that. Once we got into my room he set up my luggage for me and then as he was explaining where the ice machine was he offered to go get me some ice if I wanted some. I thought that was great. He showed me the room and some of the frills associated with it. He went above and beyond in my opinion and made me feel very welcome. 

Ah the room, here's the fun part. That room was bad ass. I have no other way of putting it. The bed was so comfortable!!! The room also had those comfy robes so you can guess what I wore when I hung around the room, lol. There was a TV in the bathroom mirror. That was the craziest thing I ever seen. Everything is digital now so it is very modern. The drapes and the ""do not disturb sign"" all worked by pushing a button rather than manually. The room had three phones in it. One next to the toilet even which I thought was funny. The shower was heavenly. It had an ordinary shower head alone with a larger one in the middle of the shower. The size of the shower was also great, very spacious and plenty of room to shower comfortably. The bathroom is also very large and has an excellent vanity area and the keep plenty of towels available. The size of the entire room in general was great. Very spacious. I also had a great view of the strip which is always nice. I was impressed with the room overall that's for sure. 

OK, I was feeling pretty tired the night I arrived and I did not feel like hunting for a place to eat so I decided to splurge a little and order room service. Fair warning and this doesn't count against them but the room service menu is very expensive and overall it is not worth it. The prices are clearly marked and I still decided to pay the extra amount for the convenience so that's my own fault. Just a fair warning that it isn't worth it really. Their customer service is stellar though. When I called the man who answered the phone was very helpful and he answered my questions about the menu and helped me come to a decision. They told me the delivery time would be about 40 minutes but they arrived much quicker than that. The person who brought me was food was very nice and polite and she set me up nicely. 

The casino was great. I actually had a lot of fun here. The table minimums here are higher than some of the other neighboring casinos but after a while I didn't even really notice. The dealers that I encountered were very fun to play with and I killed at the blackjack tables so that made me happy. 

Check out was a breeze and I hope more hotels are using this method. The sent me an email the morning of my departure asking me to schedule my checkout time so essentially I checked out via email so no lines. You can also checkout through your TV in your room as well. Very painless which is great if you have a flight to catch or something else planned. I just turned in my keys at the front desk and that was it. 

The last service I used was the bell desk for my bags. My flight did not leave until later in the afternoon so I had some time before I had to be at the airport so instead of lugging my suitcase everywhere I checked it in at the bell desk. They were excellent too. They quickly took my info and my bag and let me be on my way. When I came to pick up the bag same thing, I handed them the tag they gave me and they quickly retraived my bag and got me in a cab to the sirport.",2,2,2

Yes octavious tower is newer a little batter but further away from everything. 

The main problem I don't like staying here is the fact that if you drive, the self parking lot is like a mile away and sometimes the elevators that take you to the casino from the parking lot takes forever. Also you can get lost circling around the casino it's almost like a maze in the place. I stayed here because of the comped room but otherwise would not pay to stay here due to the reasons above. I personally prefer a casino that's less fancy with better parking access like Ballys, Paris parking lot. Ballys may not be the fanciest and the newest but the remodeled jubilee tower is nice in my opinion and it's got a fridge that u can use not full of stuff the casino hopes you grab and then charge you and arm and a leg.

We all know the ""strip"" is busy at night but when you enter mass chaos making that right turn into Caesars Palace entrance, that's a warning sign to the highest! With such a huge property the most lanes available are 2?!!! In some areas I turns to one lane, wtf! You should have seen the line of taxi cabs which hog up one of the two lane roads. Very similar to ca I505! 

If your lucky enough or smart to get to the front you will be turned away by the valet unless you are checking in. However the valet guys don't tell you this immediately. So what they do is look around, mingle with each other and occasionally walk to the cars waiting to valet and give them the bad news. Second warning, crappy service! I ended up having to make a u turn in the very small rotunda and forcing my way out of the hectic intersection (where cars and taxis are trying to enter and exit onto the strip). 

If you survived you find you way to Caesars self parking garage. This is probably the best part because this is a massive garage (at least the length if a football field if not more)! There are open slots somewhere. I got lucky and found a spot on the 3rd level but the reason why was I was at the furthest end of the garage which is furthest away from their  elevators into the casino lol! 

So now I'm in the casino and first thing you'll notice is the stench of cigarette smoke. Now I know smoking is legal in NV but the good hotels (NYNY, Cosmo, Aria, Palazzo, Venetian, Wynn, etc) try to mask it with a fresh scent or have top of the line air vents to suck up the smoke smell. Strike 3!!!

Caesars did a great job in placing a gaming machine in every nook and cranny of this building so it's takes a good bit of maneuvering to work your way through the casino while avoiding to run into the thousands of people. Many high end restaurants on the main level. Very nice food court with lots of seating a food selections. After a few minutes of walking I noticed I was in the registration area of the hotel which is towards their night club Omnia. Lost? Kinda. No signs to Bucchanal! Looked and skimmed around but no signs until I saw a very small plain looking sign that said ""buffet"". WTF!

When we first walked into the room we saw the towel ring on the bathroom counter, not installed on the front of the counter.  The other towel ring was about to fall off.  Obviously it broke off and someone just put it on the counter top.  Toilet flush handle didn't work.  I would think that the last people to see the room was housekeeping.  Does anyone inspect the rooms before they are given to guests???  We called 3 times to have these things fixed.  Each time someone said that they would be right up.  Items fixed the next day.  Room needed upgrading, drab blues from the late 1990's,  but comfortable.  Seems like the details of a landmark hotel are being ignored.  My friend and I saw a small piece of paper stay in the middle of the hallway carpet the entire time we were there.  We joked that, really, no one from house keeping saw it and picked it up....The blue rubber glove on the hallway floor outside our door lasted almost a day before someone picked it up.  Funny how the hallway always had housekeeping carts around.

Tip for drinks:  Bloody Mary's are $17 at the pool bar.  Get a free one in a plastic cup inside the casino and bring it outside.  The free one inside was better than the $17 cocktail outside by the pool.

Every time we talked to a cocktail waitress or had a question about the slot machine the employee was extremely courteous, friendly, professional, and helpful.  That is the expected customer service with a smile.......literally.

My friend unfortunately had a horrible experience with an employee of Starbucks on the first floor of the Augustus Tower.  Incredibly rude and condescending to him.  We have contacted Starbucks about the experience. I don't blame Caesars but they should monitor contracted stores on their property.

The heated pool area was great, especially in January.  Although it is obvious that things are getting run down.  A good scrubbing and touch up is needed.  Shame.

There was a long line,  no one at the counter to check you out.  They said one person was helping another.   Just one for the long line.  They said it was because it was before 9:00 a.m.  Finally I went to self check out, only to find out that they had charged extra for 6 extra drinks from the refrigerator in the room, that I never even drank.  Beware do not remove drinks from refrigerator to put a cup of milk in.  The maid took my milk out put it on the dresser put drink back in.  My $9.00 cup of milk that came with 4 cookies,  sat out for hours while we were gone.  Had to throw it away. Come to find out if you move a drink and put it back you are still charged for it. $7.00 for one bottle of water.  No place to put your drinks to keep them cold or from spoiling.  This place will nickel and dime you.The wooden door to get to the refrig, was falling off of it's hinges.  The dresser was scratched up.  Our couch had a bout a 2 to 3 inch cut\/whole in it.

You know life is good when you're wading in the Temple pool, water falling down from the fountain above, massaging your head & shoulders, cooling off from the dry Las Vegas heat.  

My stay was at the new Octavius Tower, which recently opened at the beginning of the year.  The Augustus & Octavius Towers have a separate entrance & lobby, which successfully segregates VIP' s like me (LOL) from the plebs staying at the more economical Palace Tower.  Early check-in was a breeze, and I was soon on my way to room 6278.  

Room - OMFG!  This is nice!  2 queen beds with 4 pillows & a bolster greeted us as we walked in.  A large, flat-screen TV w\/ media hub, a Keurig coffeemaker, well appointed minibar & couch were available to peruse at our leisure.  The carpeting was nice & soft, and the room window had a pretty decent view of the Bellagio fountains next door.  

The bathroom was spectacular!  There were dual sinks w\/ another flatscreen TV, a whirlpool bath and a separate shower w\/ a rainfall showerhead & glass door.  I drew a couple hot baths during my stay and enjoyed soaking my old man body, with the jets seemingly making all my worries go away.  The complimentary bath products were Gilchrist & Soames Qua Bath & Spa.  It could be the just the fancy packaging, but they seemed luxuriant.  

Pool - The Temple Pool is gorgeous.  Forget going in the afternoon, because it's literally shoulder-to-shoulder.  All someone can do is stand & pee.  I made sure to head to the pool the next day when it opened at 8am.  About 30 patrons had the same idea, but fortunately, they were concerned with confiscating pool chairs for sunbathing.  I had the circular Temple Pool all to myself for around 20 mins, in which I swam and waded underneath 1 of the 4 fountains as described earlier. Great way to cool off.  

Complimentary coffee & tea is offered at the Augustus\/Octavius lobby during the hours of 7-9 in the morning.  Bonne Maman honey from France is offered in individual mini-jars, of which I have about 10 here at home awaiting for my disposal.  Hey, it's free!  Don't judge!  Across the lobby is a Starbucks in case you don't fancy the free stuff.  BTW, Starbucks located in hotels\/casinos don't offer free WiFi.  Bummer.

Express checkout was a breeze.  I reviewed my bill on the flat-screen TV, confirmed checkout and left the room keys in the room.  

I had the time of my life.  I felt like a foreign diplomat on my way to meet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton over cucumber sandwiches to discuss diplomacy.  If you have the money to burn, I recommend staying at Caesar's Palace and re-enact your own ""Hangover"".

Good times.

I arrived here for the EVO Championship Competition (It's a video-game fighting tournament.) to check out the new games coming out and also to support some of the vendors.

Casinos and hotels in Vegas are always very luxuriously and decadent and here is no acception. There are amazing paintings on the walls and roofs and giant statues of Greek... people throughout the building. Its bright and left me awestruck (First time visitor) and I was snapping my camera left and right trying to take it all in.

I don't know how many people on Yelp go to comic book conventions or video-game expos but for those who don't know: There is always a SERIOUS funk in the air. I'm not kidding. A large room with a ton of guys who put their lives in video games and comic books, and not so much into personal hygiene, it's gonna have a musk that could very well bring a tear to your eye. (I'm really being honest and not mean. I promise.) Thankfully, Cesar's Palace has a top notch air conditioning and ventilation system that left everything breezy and light. (Thank you sweet merciful Cesar...)

I don't know if it is just me but the staff here seems a bit intimidating! Maybe because there are more bouncers then anything else. There were a few staff members I interacted with that were very nice and helpful. For the most part though I tried to avoid them.

Ok this place used to be my fave, but then ventured out and fell in love with Red Rock and The Cosmo and all the nice new casinos. I shouldnt say much though bc I now work for MGM! LOL.

So The newer rooms, like new modern bedding, are cute. The bathrooms were huge, but sometimes finding your area is confusing. Walk past the barge, 2 steps to the right and bam youre there! JK. But seriously, if youre not super familiar you can def get lost!

The slots here are so-so, they dont have a ton of NEW slots, but they have a ton of SLOTS... among sluts. LOL. I like to play in the back towards the Forum shops, thats where they have a lot of penny machines plus theres usually a cocktail waitress or 4 around.

Favorite shop at the Forums is def H&M! I love to just go and walk around and shit and people watch! I love the crazy wacky tourists! Beware though, those shops are freakin huge and you can also get lost!! Check out the giant fish tank and then go to Fat Tuesday!!",3,0,0

For those of you fortunate enough to have visited the playground in the desert or better yet live there then you probably get what I mean. Cesar's is at a central location for you to meet up, play, stay, etc. I'm sure the style hasn't changed much with its classic Roman architecture and theme over the last 50 years but there have been some upgrades as expected. 

I went on one of my annual guys only trips and this year my cheap ass friends ponied up some dough and decided to live the sweet life at Cesar's for a couple of days. Well they didn't actually pay for their rooms but were comped from Total Rewards. I was shocked because rarely do I get free room offers from Cesar's but luckily my friends were hooked up. Me being me I couldn't be outdone and had to go with a mini-suite. It was enough room for me. The room had 2 bathrooms that were connected by a shower. The master bath had a Jacuzzi tub and a bidet. You need to try the bidet if you have never experienced one or have traveled to France. I lived in Europe for some time so it's nice to see these touches. FYI-you can always get an adapter for your own toilet at home depot or lowes. Okay, that was probably TMI on bidets. The room had plenty of closets, safe, and lots of room. The room does have a mini bar but the prices are outrageous. $7 for water, yeah right. There is a CVS across the street (diagonal from the hotel) where you can get all of your sundries, water, and beer. 

The crew and I ended up spending the eve up in my room b'sing and messing with the drunkest fools after a day of boozing. We got some pretty funny pics. I seriously thought we were going to get kicked out of the hotel but I guess Vegas being Vegas they let our antics slide. We were loud and obnoxious fools. 

The pool is one of the best I have visited in Vegas. Plenty of different atmospheres. There is a Euro style pool but I didn't check it out. We mainly stayed at the Neptune pool with the bar and the black jack tables in the pool. Those dealers were like Sirens in Homer's Odyssey. They kept calling us out with their songs to come over and play. They looked nice but took our $$$ quick. The drinks at the bar are way overpriced. I did have a few drinks. The mojitos were excellent. They will run you close to $30 for a large one. They have plenty of alcohol and will last a bit. If you're playing at the tables in the pool you will get comped drinks. 

There are tons of shops and restaurants. You basically never need to leave the resort. However, you probably will since you are a Yelper. I do recommend hitting up Sushi Roku upstairs in the Shoppes. They have a great happy hour. Cesar's is fun for people watching and having a great time. This last time there were a bunch of sorority girls passed out in front of the elevator to the tower I was staying at. I didn't have time for that so I kept on walking. Come stay and play at Cesar's Palace where you will have an unforgettable time. Just remember to drink and gamble responsibly. Just kidding, I don't give a Flying F what you do. Have a great time. Happy drinking!",14,17,21

I believe people should work 60 hours a week. Six days a week at 10 hours a day. That would keep people out of trouble - they wouldn't have time to feel down let alone go to the doctors office. Sunday you would have off but you go to church and work some more as a volunteer only with no pay. Well, given I don't run things luckily you have a cushy 40 hour work week and two whole days off.

The linens and beds are extremely comfortable and clean compared to other major properties on the strip. Service is awesome; concierge and staff are considerate and competent. You can tell when checking in at other properties that the help has not been guided in the right direction. 

As for the shops and restaurants are all high quality and competent as well except for Gordon Ramsey's kitchen, stay away from certain waiters. Food is good, hostess and service is sub par by far. I had better service and competence at Caesars cafe by the entrance believe it or not. 

For steak and market fish or free range chicken or duck you have to definitely try Homestead. You will not be disappointed. Can't go wrong with Nobu or the Asian noodle house for that matter as well. Palms in the Forum shops is a sure bet, and so is the Italian restaurant by the Trevi fountain. 

I love the souvenir shop because of the hangover t-shirts and paraphernalia. 

You will not be disappointed staying at Caesars Palace. It's centrally located to other properties within a 10 minute walk which is rare on the Vegas strip. The fountain show at Bellagio, pirate show at TI, and other properties\/clubs are within a 10 minute walk as well.",0,0,0

I booked via Hotels.com and I searched for 4 guests. They gave me the room options which were all 2 beds and up based on my needs. I only put my name on the reservation since I'm checking in.

I get here and find out they downgraded me from 2 beds to 1 bed. I paid for 2 beds and money was deducted from my credit card months ago. I believe that's the whole concept of a reservation. Caesar Palace's policy is that number of beds is considered a preference. I am appalled. Booking the number of beds to me is part of the deal, NOT a preference. They show 1 or 2 bed options. No one chooses the 2 bed rate thinking it's not part of the reservation. They also say only my name was on the reservation so they didn't save me my 2 beds. 

It got worse when we ordered food at 12 am. A room service person knocked on our room with the wrong food and said our food was right next to her. Time passes and I call dining. It has been 1 hour now, I called and they said they were out of the dish I orderes. It's ridiculous that I had to call and find that out myself after waiting an hour.

1.  Hubby signed up for online early check in. When we checked out a couple of days later, low and behold there was a b.s. $30 charge for this service.  Hubby was unaware and went back into confirmation email and there was no mention of this, including in the ""fine print"".  Nice try, but no cigar, we demanded it be removed.  A manager finally agreed to remove it.

2.  Back to arrival and check in, our premium and upgraded room (which we paid more $ for) was meh and a problem to boot immediately!  The supposed new luxurious bed was so crappy and soft that after hubby sat it was sinking to middle.  After getting up, an indentation stayed.  After wasting over 30 minutes on phone a guest relations manager said she would have us moved to an older tower, with what ""she was told"" we're firmer beds.  She said go on with our plans and room would be made ready, bags moved and a call or text later when complete.  No call and no text, made our way back and bags not moved!  Caesar's apology was removal of the per night resort fees and $50 dining credit.  I guess it's something ...  Old Palace tower, far and old, blech!  Oh yeah, the bed was only a 20% improvement.

3.  The famous No. 1 buffet Baccahanal, a disappointment!  We did the lunch\/dinner 2:00 pm 3:00 pm switch to get to try more of the foods for the cheaper price, but it was pricier due to the Thanksgiving holiday!  Line for the kiosk was spitting out the call back text reservations for 3 hours later and then you'd have another line wait of approx. 1 1\/2 hours!  But wait Caesars will help you skip the line, for $25 pp additionally, you get to go immediately.  We had show tickets later and we couldn't wait all that time so a decision had to be made ""on the spot"".  How bad do we want to eat at the famous Baccahanal?!  Hubby and I forged ahead, paid  the extra extra money and guess what?, still had to wait in a shorter 20 minute line.  Finally food.   Continued below for easier on the eyes reading ...

Overall I definitely didn't get my money's worth with weak Bloody Mary's, not so great prime rib, ramen ruined with too much seaweed and noodles not cooked properly, fatty honey ham, definitely not like the taste or quality of Honeybaked Ham!  Lamb chops (a huge fave normally) that were seasoned & cooked well, with poor quality of meat used, definitely not New Zealand lamb.  The list could keep going but you get the idea.

There were a few standouts for me:  carne asada street tacos, warm chocolate lava cake, and bbq pork.  These were terrific.  Our waiter was also great.  Overall, Bacchanal was a huge disappointment.

1. After an recovering alcoholic friend ordered a drink with no alcohol, they brought her one with vodka - which she drank all of, not realizing. She figured it out, told the waitress she was upset and stormed out. The waitress then brought me an un-itemized bill, which, when I asked for the breakdown, included $12 for the vodka. When I protested, the waitress said, ""Well, she DRANK it.""

2. Having moved the wildly overpriced mini-bar items on top of the dresser to make room for our things (and then moving them back at the end), they charged us $146 after checkout, because their motion sensors told them that we used every one of them (when we had used ZERO). When I called and protested that at the very least they should explain that possibility to people, they said, ""Well, it's posted in the room, and we don't have time to explain every detail to every customer."" Needless to say, we never saw that posted.

I got no apology from either. Nothing but a ""have a nice day"" through gritted teeth attitude from both. Caesar's will not see another dime of our money in this lifetime, and I'd suggest you send yours elsewhere, too.",4,3,2

You come to Vegas expecting great service, right? 

The moment we arrived at the check in we were greeted by a dismissive woman named BLAIR who immediately shirked us off before we even got to the counter telling us just to wait in line. Her tone made me feel like I was at a Holiday Inn somewhere in the sticks. I thought: is she having a bad day and rude to everyone? But when I saw that wasn't the case i figured maybe it's because she assumed we were non English speaking Asian tourists and thought she could treat us like second class citizens. 

But we still waited patiently while she continued to ignore us. 

After a while we asked when she could help us and she just said ""it will be a while"". ""How long?  We've been waiting for a while"" ""i don't know, a while.  I was busy when you came up to me so a while"".  Her rudeness and attitude was shocking beyond being totally inappropriate. 

 90% of your job is to accommodate guests and make them feel welcome and all you can muster is a lousy attitude that makes guests feel like a nuisance?

When we called her out for her disrespectful tone she started arguing back at us giving us more attitude! I can't think of any other time I've come to Vegas and been treated so poorly. I suggest she leaves the service industry if she dislikes helping people so much.",5,3,1

The big problem I have with this is the room service. Ordered a mocha to start the day and it didn't come til 50 minutes later. It went to the time that I forgot I ordered something. And the mocha was lukewarm. ????
But The Jupiter Pool gains a star. Secluded from the loud noises, sitting on a chaise in a cabana, and a back massage when needed, this is almost like Hawaii....... almost.

Stayed here in 2015 and all I remember from my stay is the lack of a bathroom door!!! 
I guess it doesn't matter if you're staying with your spouse or someone whom you are super comfortable around. However, the bathroom is right next to the front door so if someone opens the front door, people passing by *may* be able to see you doing your business. 

I was on the toilet when we got a call from the front desk. I don't recall the details, but maybe they were calling about bringing our luggage up. My husband answered the phone and told them to come up to which I screamed that I was on the toilet and to not come up. I guess they heard me because my husband started laughing hysterically. :[

We had great tickets to Elton John so I decided to stay at Caesars for logistics.   Big mistake.    Not only is the price of a standard room high, they charge you for everything.   I should have known when I called the concierge a week before my stay to get a bottle of Champaign in our room when we checked in.   Impossible according to her.   No service from my perspective.   Second, I asked if I could Schedule a pickup from the hotel but since I am not a Total Rewards member, I guess I am not important enough.  Strike two and I hadn't even arrived yet.   I was willing g to pay for the ride but no dice.   I got to the hotel and waited about 16 minutes for a room even though I did online check-in. My wife went to the bar to get $32 drinks for two. They asked what was taking so long and she indicated she needed to talk to somebody to make it possible. I had put in for an upgrade on the room but that didn't go through but they still charge me. I had caught that mistake and have them take it off my bill. I was also charged $25 for a resort fee for both Saturday and Sunday even though I was this there one night. We got to the room it was nice and clean but small for what we had paid. The next morning we woke up we found out that even though there was a coffee maker in the machine they wanted to charge you $13 to use their grounds.

We had a room on the 3rd floor of the Roman tower.  It seemed pretty clean at first glance but a closer look showed a lack of attention to detail that you would expect from such a highly rated hotel.  The glasses in the bathroom were not cleaned we'll (big white spots in both of them) and there was a lot of dust on the ledges and base boards.  Additionally, we had a constantly running toilet in the room.  If I called, We probably could have changed rooms or had it fixed but we arrived later than expected and had to leave quickly to make a scheduled event and it just wasn't worth the hassle at the time.  The room was starting to show its age as well (peeling wallpaper, part of the baseboard falling down in the bathroom, dents in the wall where suitcase and luggage racks had banged, hair dryer didn't work and kept making the breaker  pop and the lights go off) nothing we couldn't live with but also something I didn't expect from a 4.5 star hotel.  I know Vegas is specifically designed  to get you into the casinos and keep you there as long as possible but the lack of amenities in the room was worse than I've ever seen in 7 other  hotels on the strip (no fridge, mini bar, or coffee maker).   

The food in the hotel was very good but also very expensive and the casual options left much to be desired.  Another mind boggler was that you couldn't get a table at 1040 pm in anything other than the lobby restaurant because they closed at 11.  We were there running a race that ended at night directly in front of the hotel and had 40,000 people participating.   You would figure they would extend the hours of at least a couple restaurants for that night; they were all packed so they definitely would have made $. 

The location was great, centrally located, Easy-ish access  to the monorail (across the street through the flamingo), and within walking distance to great local attractions (bellagio fountains\/mirage volcano) and perfect location for hobbling marathon finishers.

Overall, it'd take a really good price to get me to come back here.  It was nice but there are much cheaper options that Caesars doesn't blow out of the water which I felt it should have given the higher price.",1,0,0

The bathroom ""cabinet"" for the sink was showing its age with chipping edges on the wood but still a very nice set-up overall.  We had a smoking room but no ashtrays!  I called down for some and they did quickly get them up to the room for me.

But that's where the good stuff ends. Valet was full unless you were Diamond or 7 Stars. Check-in was long... really long. I attempted to the use the self-check-in but it wouldn't accept my passport or other ID.  Finally one of the self-check-in clerks came over and did something to help check me in and told me I had to go stand in the Mail and Keys line, which was close to ten people deep.  None of them bothered to mention that there was a Platinum line we could have used - it was on the far left side of check-in for those of y'all with such cards.  Our desk clerk was very kind and nice though.  Bell staff took more than an hour to bring up our bags.... and that was an hour we could have been gambling.

However when we did finally go downstairs to gamble, we couldn't find a cocktail waitress until I was in the semi-high limit slots area and there was only one there.  She was too flustered to take additional orders as her tray was full and she promised to return but didn't after 20 minutes.

I couldn't find another one anywhere.  At one of the slots, the lady next to me had a machine error and neither of us could find a slot attendant until close to 30 minutes had passed.

We were upgraded at check-in to a suite in the Palace Towers.  Single LCD TV, jacuzzi tub, 2 bathrooms with 2 toilets and a large two-person shower... awesome.

The Palace Tower is nice, although if you can get a suite in the Augustus Tower, that would be nicer for the views.  Our suite was looking at the new Octavius Tower that's almost done... surprisingly, there's not much construction noise.

Pros:
- Nice upgrade and suite 
- Great central location on the strip
- Love the Forum shops
- It's classic Caesars... yes the Wynn and the Palazzo are swankier, but there's something nice about the history here.

Cons:
- They charge for everything... wish they would provide free internet
- The fridge is filled with their items on sensor - we moved stuff aroudn for our own items and had to get the bill adjusted at the end
- Pools currently closed for renos - I suspect it'll be nice when they're done

On average I stay here roughly two to three times a year when I can sneak away from my life and duties of my job. Caesar's Palace is my go to vacation stay in Vegas and always  impresses me on their attention to detail in their customer service. Even though some say it is old, it is the grandest of the old school Casinos left on the strip. I ask what is wrong with an old classy regal business? I believe there is no finer hotel than Caesar's Palace. It is nearly in the center of the strip and the service is beyond reproach. What we got this last week was a magnificent Palace Tower Premium King room, whirlpool tub separate shower bathroom with marble and granite everywhere. We had a partial strip view. The room was wonderful. Our stay was wonderful. Customer service was outstanding. Staff on the Casino floor was excellent. Valet service was  excellent, we pulled pass the valet full sign and even though valet was full the staff let us leave the car until a parking place was available since we had reservations for three nights. They even called me by name even though I never volunteered it. Somewhere someone on staff knew I was a returning customer

Overall my stay was very nice and enjoyable. Boy, this place is HUGE. After the 2nd day I found some shortcuts back to my tower elevators. My room was comfortable and in good repair and was cleaned very well each and everyday.

The rooms are very large and there is plenty of room to move around. My one wish would have been to have coffee in the room without having to by a ""kit"" for $13.00. Oh well, it wasn't missed too badly. I had a nice desk in my room for a work area and I was able to ""spread out"" and be productive.

The hotel staff was very responsive and cordial anytime I had contact with them. I'll definitely return to Caesar's and stay there next time I'm in Vegas.",6,0,2

For us, caesars was a splurge and I noted on our reservation what we were here for hoping for maybe a comp upgrade. I understood that we would be early and before check in, but figured we'd at least get a room at some point before the normal 4 PM check in. They told me I'd get a call so we went out and did some things to kill time. We ended up back in the line at 3:45 and waited in their LONG line. We got up, I told them I still had no call and was there really no rooms available. She said no and I pressed and she had to call her ""inventory"" line. Literally she didn't say a word to anyone on the other line and about 30 seconds later she hangs up and says ""something just became available!"". I mean come on.

I was upsold to the Octavius Tower.  The main reason I did it was not because it was a nicer room but rather, for the parking.  The woman at the front desk told me they had special valet parking with an entrance on Flamingo.  It had just taken me 30 minutes to go 1 1\/2 blocks on the strip, so that benefit alone was worth the upgrade.  I picked up my wife at the airport about an hour later (she had arrived that evening) and we zipped into the valet without having to deal with the strip traffic.  I was very pleased until I was told that unless I was a ""Diamond"" or ""Seven Seas"" card level, I couldn't park there.  When I informed the valet what the lady at the front desk said and why I upgraded the room, he just said sorry and when they were full that didn't apply (he then preceded to direct me to the Forum Shops valet...which is all the way down by self parking.....what's the point?!).  When I complained to their customer service, the witch on the phone said since I didn't appear to be happy with the arraignment, we could just pack our bags and move to the room we originally had.  Imagine that.  They upsell me on false pretenses, it takes me a total of 45 minutes to get back to the hotel after being redirected, and now she wants to inconvenience me more by packing up!  I let her have it and insisted on talking to a manager.  He apologized for her behavior and gave me a $75 food credit.  Might I suggest to management that if there is some stipulation on your service, you sure as hell should mention it when you're upselling someone.  I wouldn't have wasted my time or money on it if I knew it wasn't guaranteed (and your Front Desk person knew that by the comments I made to her)

As for the casino itself, the best analogy I could give is a person living in a small town and going to New York.  The place has gotten too big for it's own good (and their staff doesn't seem well equipped to deal with the traffic).  No matter where you went, it was a long walk.  Ironically, for such a huge area, their table area is rather small.  There's very little about this place that's relaxing (I usually stay at the Wynn and it's much more enjoyable).  Their new buffet, Bacchanal, has lines the size of the bigger attractions at Disneyland (it was an hour and a half wait on Saturday night).  Of course, if you were a ""Diamond"" or ""Seven Seas"" member you got to cut the line (or you could pay a $20 line pass....hilarious).  Once inside, there were still lines everywhere.  

On the day we were checking out, I had to wait 2 hours to cash a sports ticket because their computer were down.  When I went to the ""special"" Octavius Tower registration desk, the woman said her computers had limited access, so she couldn't print my boarding pass and directed me to the Front desk.  The woman at the Front desk seemed annoyed that I had taken her away from some paperwork (keep in mind this was at 3:30am...we had a plane at 6).  She said the concierge normally takes care of that and they weren't open until 8 so I would have to go to a ""paid"" kiosk by the Total Reward Center.  Again annoyed, I went back to the Octavius Registration.  There was another lady there and she said she could print my boarding pass.  After 4-5 minutes she said she couldn't find my reservation.  I told her I was sure it was right.  Somehow the woman thought my first name was my last name (not exactly a common mistake).  I truly have to wonder when this hotel hires people if the manager just puts a mirror under their nose, and if it fogs up, you're hired.  Seriously, there are a lot of brain dead people at this hotel.  They also treat anyone that isn't a ""Diamond"" or ""Seven Seas"" member like crap.  When I'm at the Wynn, they certainly roll out the carpet for their high rollers (yeah, I get it), but they treat everyone else nice also.  There's no reason why you can't do both.  I never even notice the difference in service at the Wynn and am always treated very nicely.  I don't care what kind of deal I get at this place when I go back to Vegas, I won't be staying here again.

P.S.  I was just reminded about their marketing of their ""no resort fees"".  If you and your partner use internet, it's a joke.  They'll make more off of you then the resorts that offer a ""resort"" fee.  We paid on average about $10 more per day and luckily we didn't go to the gym (yeah, that's extra also).  The ""no resort fees"" ploy is just a gimmick for them to make more money.",0,0,0

We stayed in the Palace tower premium room with king bed (previously known as petite suite). In summary, we were very pleased with the entire experience.

Parking:
It is true!! Caesars Palace parking is quite big and very far from the main lobby, and even further away from the room you will end up staying. It will be much better to do vallet parking. 

Check-in:
We checked in on Friday, so the line was quite long. However, they managed to take care everybody somewhat quick (under 30 min). They also offered us (and other customers) water while waiting to be served. The front desk was very friendly.

Bathroom:
Our bathroom was impressive. We had 2 sides of bathroom (supposedly, one for him and one for her), 2 toilet (one is regular... presumably for him, and one is accompanied with a bidet). One side of the bathroom has Jacuzzi bubble tub where you can relax yourself while getting bubble massage.

Bedroom:
The room decor was quite nice. Room area is spotless. Carpet was clean and vibrant. The king bed was very comfortable. Definitely, one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on. Our room was facing the pool. Thus, the window view is quite spectacular.

After a late night drinking and gambling I like to make the usual complementary in room coffee.
I've stayed in some crappy hotels before and they have coffee. 
It may be minor to some but Caesars has Keurig coffee makers in the rooms, get this they don't provide the coffee, you have to order it from room service (for a charge). Why wouldn't you order a cup of coffee.

On the parking garage- FREE parking but yes, it is crowded, especially on the weekeds- Tip: park on the roof for a nice view of The Strip (take that selfie). 

On the Forum Shops- since the expansion; another wing of three floors of stores was added. It's huge! And navigation is sometimes tricky, you gotta use the elevator for access to certain floors. Or the escalators, on that note. Some of the STORES include: Sony (the only one in Las Vegas), Burberry, Christian Dior. Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Gianni Versace, Gucci, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Tiffany & Co., Valentino. I can't list them all, or else I'd run out of space!

Lots of restaurants in the casino (kind of past the parking garage elevator entrance\/exit into the casino, it's elevated) and in the Forum Shops, DINING includes: Beijing Noodle No. 9, Bradley Ogden, Central by Michel Richard, Cypress Street Marketplace, Empress Court, Hyakumi, Lago Buffet, Mesa Grill, Munchbar, NOBU Restaurant, Old Homestead Steakhouse, Payard Pãtisserie & Bistro, Raos, Restaurant Guy Savoy, Serendipity 3.

Pools- there are six of them, including the Venus pool

Some example of past Entertainment: elton john, absinthe (variety show), matt goss, jerry seinfeld (comedy), celine dion (recently cancelled residency, or postponed it), rod stewart, shania twain, russell peters (comedy), jeff dunham (comedy)

On the casino decor and theme, it's changed over the years. I liked the themes back in the day (referring to most of the casinos on the Strip as well), but seems like the new direction is what my husband calls ""Yuppie."" Same thing with the cocktail waitress outfits, those have evolved too. I used to party at Cleopatra's Barge where local music lounge groups performed such as Jonathan & Music Magic (which was a hotspot for hookers back in the 1990s). Am I dating myself? Uh-oh! Another thing, not sure, if I saw it the last time we came here, but there used to be a man and a woman wearing costumes at the entrance of the Forum Shops; tourists could take pictures with them; I have some of those pics somewhere. On the casino size, seems a little small, especially in comparison with the shopping part of the property.
Wonder, overall, if this property being featured in ""The Hangover"" gave it more exposure.    

I used to come here whenever visitors from out of town would want to see the Strip and\/or walk around. And you know what? My family and I still come here to check it out from time to time  too (though it's not as often). One time we ran into a past co-worker of my husband's, who is now a police officer.

I loved it!!! We stayed in the Augustus towers and we were super glad we did.  We loved the closeness of the Augustus towers first of all as it was very easy to to drop in and out without having to walk all over the place.  While the other towers were nearby, Augustus was the way to go.  The location on the strip is great and we were certainly excited we chose this place.  It also helps that those nights are included for SPG members as well.  We arrived and were checked in very quickly.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to us and we got a great vibe from them.  Our room was ready and we had a high floor - that was a great upgrade.  The rooms in the Augustus were really big and I was happy that my money went to a great sized room.  We had so much space for my stuff.  The resort itself is well taken care of and since our family were also staying at Caesars this made it perfect.  The amenities were excellent and the housekeeping did an amazing job at taking our requests for when it came to cleaning the rooms.

Gym doesn't open until 6am and then there is a 2 part check in process to get a workout.  I thought this city never sleeps??  Seems like they are trying to make people sleep since I had to go to 4 different coffee places (all closed) at 5:30 in the morning before I had to go down the block to Starbucks.  Front desk couldn't even tell me that the one Starbucks near the gym was open at 5:30.  The service there is lackadaisical at best. Cashier is sweet, barista is unconcerned with speed. Took 5 minutes to make my latte and mine was the only one - reason?  She walked away after starting it.  Cashier noticed and finished it for me.  And DON'T get me started on the smoke and lack of ventilation.  EVERY square inch of this hotel leaves you gasping for fresh air.  50 Years OLD is right!  I didn't even comment on everything I could have.  Maybe they should implode Caesars and start over.   Was here for work not vacation, but travel a lot for work, in Vegas and elsewhere. This by far worst experience in 15 years.",1,2,0

The entire hotel and casino is stunningly beautiful and the decor is just gorgeous. The hotel is also located near the middle of the Las Vegas Strip, which makes getting to other hotels\/casinos very easy.

The Forum Shops are a real treat. Walking through was essentially is an indoor mall,  they have the ceiling painted to look like the sky. Paired with replica of the Trevi fountain, you've given the impression that you're shopping outdoors in Rome during the late afternoon.

At the far end of the Forum Shops, they have a large fountain that doubles as a fish aquarium. The statues in the fountain also come to life periodically throughout the day to provide guests with an awesome free show. (Note: at the time of this review, the Atlantis show has been closed due to remodeling\/upgrading. It's scheduled to be back in October 2013)

Besides the large casino and very nice shops & restaurants, Caeser's Palace also offers shows by big-name entertainers such as Celine Dion, Luis Miguel, and Elton John.

The room rates are quite expensive from my experiences and it's the sole reason I have to knock-off one star from my Yelp rating.

My advice... stay at a cheaper hotel on the Strip, but make sure you pay a visit to Caesar's Palace.",1,0,0

We were able to get a room here for 2 nights using our Total Rewards comps which was pretty sweet. The good thing about Caesars is that there are different levels of rooms\/suites within one hotel to fit a variety of price ranges. (There's a $40K\/night villa!) Depending on where your room is situation, you *may* get a view of the Bellagio Fountains!

The hotel is H-U-G-E and you're definitely going to hit your FitBit\/Apple Watch step count goals here every day just by staying inside the hotel!  In addition to a large amount of table games and slot machines in their casino, they also have a wonderful spa (see my review for Qua Baths and Spa), several towers for rooms and suites, tons of restaurants, and a great shopping area called The Forum with a good mix of mid-to-high-end shops. Additionally, there's a bridge attached to the hotel that connects you to the Bellagio and to go across the street to The Flamingo.

Our room was located in the Forum Towers. For a regular room (vs. a suite), it was pretty spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom is stocked with Qua products (same brand that their spa uses). My only complaint is that the shower because it was lukewarm at 10AM and even though I put it at the max heat, it never got as warm as I wanted it to be.",7,3,5

Most hotels on the strip had a pretty good filter which filters off the cigarette smoke.  I walked into Caesars and I was blown away by how it smelled.  I understand that smoking is allowed but I really think Caesar needs to step up their game when competing with hotels like Bellagio, Wynn, Encore, Aria, etc.  

On the side note: I'm starting to see LOTS of footprints on the parking lot ceilings which leads me to the conclusion that this place is heading towards Circus Circus status. Just saying.",4,2,0

update: was in Vegas for Memorial Day, and though we were staying elsewhere, we went to the pool at Caesar's--it was awesome.

And this was my first time staying in Caesars palace. I usually stayed hotel at Venetian and Wynn. Yesterday I moved from Venetian to Caesars just for experiencing a new atmosphere; however, I was so disappointed! I really didn't want to compare Caesars with Venetian but I spontaneously will make judgements. I booked this hotel one and half month ago with the same price at Venetian which was $195. First of all, the light bulb in my bathroom was broken so I had to dial someone to fix this problem. Of course the room was old and even didn't possess enough chairs for customers to relax. Moreover, the sheets was not comfortable at all. Fortunately, I was provided with a coffee maker which is better than Venetian. The really unpleasant moment created when I checked out just now. I was required to pay attritional 20 dollars 24 hour block fee. I asked one of the assistant and she explained this fee was charged for additional devices to link wifi. I was not really cared about paying these 20 dollars, I was mad because there was no obvious or clean direction to inform me that the resourt fee only cover the wifi for 2 electronic devices! I have unlimited date why I had to pay additional money to use wifi in this hotel?! Moreover, Caesars are encouraging customers check in and check out by themselves with machine, I understand the hotel arrange someone to assist customers. The reason why encourage customers to check in and out is to save time and make it goes more effiecntly, and to save labor cost. In this situation, why hotel cannot arrange enough staff to work at the entrance door for example for valet parking or serves. In addition there is no seating area for customers to seat while they are waiting Valets to pull out the cars. And the serves I asked for information adopted an arrogant attitude, treated me like someone who was not capable of speaking English. I tried my best to not upgrade this issue to a racial  discrimination problem. However, I was really mad. The hotel Paris that I had stayed in two years ago was even better than Caesars, and we all know these two hotels have the similar price! Due to this bad expericences at Caesars, I will never ever stay in this hotel; moreover, I will also inform my friends and colleagues not to come to this hotel.

It was HUGE for a hotel room -- especially in Vegas -- and we had a fabulous view of the mountains the pools!  

I love Caesar's because it is WAY over the top (just like most everything else in Vegas!), it is centrally located on the strip, and it has pretty much everything you could want in one place.  I love the shopping, the restaurants, and the pools.  

While Caesar's is somewhat more expensive than other Vegas hotels, it is definitely worth the price to me.  To have so many restaurant options available is fantastic.  I love the food court option too as it is a little less expensive and it allows you to watch the action on the casino floor while you eat.  Fun!  

The group we were with was not really interested in high stakes gambling, so we mostly stuck with slot machines here.  We did it for the drinks, mostly, and I have to say that for free drinks they were really, really, really strong.  

Another reason we chose to stay at Caesar's was for the pools.  We spent a couple of days floating in the water while having the friendly waitresses bring us drinks.  It was heavenly!  The food they serve is typical bar food, but it hits the spot after a long day in the sun.

We took a cab from the airport and headed down the strip to the hotel...little did I know it took up like four city blocks! I was THRILLED.  I've always had a thing for Greece and Italy, so this hotel seemed fitting.  I was in awe ...considering this was my first trip! :) 

Upon arriving, I took photos of everything from the lobby to the casino...I thought it was gorgeous...was it crowded, yes!  Was it overdramatic, of course! Was it Vegas?  DEFINITELY! 

We pulled the ""$20 Trick"" by placing a $20 under our CC (thanks Sarah G.!!) and telling her about my birthday.  She upgraded us from a standard room to a junior suite with a Jacuzzi.  It had ZERO view, but I loooove Jacuzzi bathtubs, so the view was pointless. :) I was thrilled!!

What I was not perfectly thrilled with was the kids...they were freakin' EVERYWHERE...and there is a Pussy Cats Doll bar in the middle of the hotel that boasts girls dancing in cages OUTSIDE the door, so...hope your 5 year old enjoyed that show!

If you book directly through the hotel website, it's always easier to change the room, upgrade or whatever you need. They have different elevators section depending on where you room is so, it's always nice and easy access in and out.

Maybe it's because the way the city is so centered on delivering the best and the inflation of costs to cover that. So when it came to Caesar's, I needed to know what it was all about. 

Whenever I come to Vegas, I usually stay at the newer, more modern hotels but this trip, I wanted to see why Caesar's remain to be one of the oldest casino's but yet can afford to expand every year and also hold one of the best shopping and eating areas in Vegas. 

When I checked in on Saturday, I had a the Forum Tower Deluxe room booked. But as I was checking in, the front desk asked if I wanted to upgrade my room to a Palace Petite Suite for just 60$. He explained that it double the size of the Deluxe room + more modern. I immediately took the deal and made my way to my room and man o man, was I disappointed. The rooms are in SERIOUS need of a renovation. Based on other yelpers, apparently only some of the towers are renovated to have the modern feel but my room was clearly not one of them. The walls had the old wallpapers from I don't know, the 90's? And also, the TV was really old and small (I mean TV's being so affordable these days, they can't upgrade that?). Anyways, I overlooked the aesthetic flaws of the room and went to go take a shower. WTF? The shower doesn't have hot water. Like really? NO HOT WATER IN VEGAS?! So I called the front desk and complain about the issue of the hot water on top of that, I wanted to actually downgrade my room back to a Forum Deluxe. They tell me that all the rooms have been booked and that I can't change my room unless it was upgraded to a more expensive suite and that they would send over a technician to check out the problem. At this point, I was already disgruntled by the service here and waited impatiently for the technician. Fortunately, he came immediately and tells me that this issue is an actual issue that requires them to open up the shower and change the hot water cartridge. I call back the front desk and the supervisor advises me that I would need to go back down to the front desk and speak personally with the supervisor about this issue. 

At this point, I was already furious and marched my way down to the front desk and I tell them my issue (I was rude and I had a reason to). They gave me a $50 food and beverage credit for this mistake and they move me to a similar room one floor above (I thought they had no more rooms left?). 

Honestly, Caesar's Palace might not have resort fees but they also don't have a refrigerators in their room (yeah, if you want one, you need to rent one for $$$) and their rooms are OLD. I realize that this hotel is one of the oldest ones but honestly, it's just a tourist trap. If it wasn't for their somewhat good service and providing compensation for their faulty rooms, they would've received a 1 star. 

I rather pay less and get a better room at the Cosmo and a lot better service.",0,1,0

Pros:
Location, location, location
Service is mostly great throughout the property
Pool is AMAZING
Good restaurants
Casino is huge, so lots of options for everyone
Rooms are comfortable--especially the Palace tower.
Full size Jacuzzi tub in the Palace tower! Not just a dinky tub with jets being called a hot tub
The newly improved buffet is very popular (aka crowded) but so good!!!

Cons:
Not many! The property is HUGE so it does take a while to get around and it's very easy to get lost
Prices aren't always the best but good deals can be had, especially with Total Rewards membership 
They recently started billing a resort fee, which sucks but is expected
Valet can take a really long time
Room service is eh

Definitely a Vegas classic and great place to stay. I particularly love staying here during the summer because the pool (and the service and pricey but delicious drinks at the pool) is a lot of fun without being an exclusive party-pool atmosphere

The wife and I wanted to try somewhere new. We went the weekend after July 4th for a wedding off the strip. Checked in Sunday afternoon. 

When we arrived, the valet line was about a 15 minute wait. I stood in line to check in for 45 minutes. They upgraded our room after complaining so I was a happy camper. After the wedding  (10:30), we returned to Caesars only to find out both valets were full\/closed. Forced to self park in a parking structure a solid 3\/4 mile from our room. My wife is pregnant. The structure had to be about 125 degrees and we were forced to park at the end. 

The next day we went to the pool at 11:00. Ordered a beer ($11) and a virgin daiquiri  ($12). Our server said that it would be a total of $33. Sober, I said that 11+12 is $23. She said, oh yeah... I'm not sure how often she gets away with that, but it ruined my morning.
Lastly, there was a mystery stain (looked like cum) on our carpet that I left a note by for it to be cleaned. It wasn't.

Caesars is not as nice as say, the Wynn, Bellagio, or the Venetian suites but it is definitely a step up from MGM Grand, Paris, Harrah's, etc. in my opinion.

I got a pretty good deal on the Forum Tower Deluxe Room on Gilt\/Jetsetter (http:\/\/www.jetsetter.com\/invite\/48217953acm63jdgx42z).  My friends also booked through Jetsetter and got a comp upgrade to the Palace Tower when they checked in.  The Palace Tower rooms are a bit bigger than the Forum Tower, with a larger bathroom and jacuzzi tub.  Both of the rooms were clean and recently remodeled I believe.  Some of the other towers in the hotel may be older, but I liked the Forum and Palace Towers well enough to stay there again.

Unlike my experience at MGM Grand, we didn't have any troubles with the staff; they were helpful, accommodating, and did their job.  It was a quick check-in and check-out.  There are also more things to do around the hotel, with the Forum Shops (and Fat Tuesdaaaay bahah).  Location is prime - it was a relatively short walking distance to most of the places we wanted to go.

Overall, I'd stay here again as long as the rates are reasonable.  If you can find rooms priced around the same as MGM, Paris, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, etc. I'd definitely recommend booking at Caesars.

Granted I only stayed for one night, but from check in to check out was seamless and pretty simple.

I stayed in the Octavius Tower with a pool view.  It was a nice room, but I don't use my room for much more than a place to sleep.  However, it was nice.  Not gonna complain.

The gaming was pretty good to me.  I'm a roulette player... and I did ok.  Best hit was a 3 number, 50$ (15$,15$, 20$) bet.  I hit on #13 for 525.00 just before checking out.

I had an awesome breakfast at Cafe Americano... simple breakfast.  The bacon was really good.  Service was on par as well.  I will definitely eat here for my next stay.

Compliments to Anka for the excellent customer service during check in.

Recently I just stayed at the infamous, (Caesar's Palace) where the Hangover was supposedly filmed but really it was filmed in a studio. It was a family Christmas vacay trip, so there was no hardcore partying or craziness going on. Just some R & R with the whole family, since I hardly see most of them. 

During this trip, the Vegas strip was so damn crowded, I even felt claustrophobic when I was walking around the Caesar's casino and around the strip. 

It was that crowded! 

My Mom received a comp room at Caesar's Palace, so I thought it wouldnt be so bad as long at the room was clean and safe. We were given a room in the Roman Tower (Built in the 1966), it ended up being ok, not as modern as other renovated rooms. The mattress was lumpy, there was some wear and tear on the furniture, the bathroom was outdated but doable. 

What frustrated us, was the not so complimentary WiFi that was included with the resort fee. It turns out, there was only one device available per 24 hour period for wifi use. In this case, I have the option of using my laptop or smart phone for wifi, plus it was super slow. The Cosmopolitan allows it's guests to use an unlimited amount of devices and the speed was excellent. 

All in all, the staff was friendly, they have lots of restaurant options, forum shops is just a few feet away, and it's on the center strip where most of the action is.",4,3,2

I had to pump the whole weekend and needed a place to store my breast milk. The mini fridge in the room is stocked with alcohol and it's all on sensors so if you move them you are automatically charged the incredibly over inflated prices even if you don't consume anything. I explained to the front desk on the phone that I needed to store my breast milk and they offered a second mini fridge for $25 a day (we were here 4 days). Even when I tried to explain why I needed it the woman was unsympathetic and wouldn't budge. I then talked to another employee in person and they said they could totally do a mini fridge with no charge because it's considered for medical purposes. She said it would be up in 30 min... 5 hrs later no fridge. I called the front desk and they said they would send it up right away. Nothing. The next morning I went down again and told them it had been 24 hours and I had to hold the milk on ice in our bathroom sink (continuously having to refill the sink with ice) to keep everything cold. I was practically in tears I was so frustrated. The guy was totally unapologetic and said it would be right up. Finally it did come but the fact that i has to ask 4 times and wait 24 hours in a deluxe hotel is ridiculous. We are never staying here again.,0,0,0

It was pretty much smack dab in the middle of the strip that I hung out at. There was a mix of all age groups. There were the groups of party goers, the cool kids, the family oriented, and the drinkers.

I stayed at the Augustus, Laurel Collection and the room was great! I had a two queen sized bedroom, a couch, table with chairs and an awesome view of the Bellagio fountain. The workers there actually seem to care about how you are and if you need anything.

 I seemed to be the night owl that went out late at night and came back to the room around the time the hotel staff were cleaning the other rooms. I had light conversations with the maid service people who are really cool and happy to greet you. I have a 'baby face.' So I got carded at least 5 times a night but it worked out in my favor because the drink ladies always seemed to ask me if I wanted anything (I'm sure it's so that they could card me politely)... Which means I had the drinks flowing all night ^_^ 

I went there while the weather was in the triple numbers (115 degrees). I am glad to report that the rooms, halls, shopping malls, casino, etc. were all at a constantly cool temperature. 

A bonus to staying at Caesar's Palace is that it is attached to the Forum Shops which also includes the Animatronics show, 'The Fall of Atlantis.' It's definitely a show that everyone should check out. 

There are also a bunch of pools, I think at least 6, that is great to either work on your tan nearby or jump in and float around. There is also a club that is open on Wednesday nights, I think, and the weekend. I didn't go but I was heading back to the hotel room around 1am and, let me tell you, that club was PACKED. I'm talking mini dresses and horny drunk guys for days. The bouncers were cool and broke up a small fight between two guys who were fighting over this drunk chick who could care less. They were quick and kept the yelling to a minimum. 

Overall, I would definitely stay here again ^_^",0,1,0

Caesar's Palace is probably the only old-school Vegas Strip hotel to actually keep up with the times and modernize quickly enough to have never become obsolete. Case in point: Caesar's opened 2 years BEFORE Circus Circus. Compare the two today. Enough said.

The casino is a sprawling wonderland of flashing lights, soaring ceilings and trendy bars. It is the ONLY casino on the Strip where I could reliably find a cocktail waitress any time I wanted a drink. For that fact alone, I found myself pumping far more money into Caesar's slot machines than any other casino. 

The pool area is gorgeous, though they were closed when we visited. This also meant that the poolside bar didn't have any of its frozen drinks in stock, so we had to get a second-rate Piña Colada at one of the indoor bars. Boo.

Another attribute worth noting: Qua Spa at Caesar's Palace is heaven. $45 for a day pass (or free if you buy a treatment) and you'll wonder why you ever came to Vegas for the food and gambling. I'm tempted to fly back west just to be pampered there again.

So for being my favorite hang-out on the Strip, Caesar's gets 4 stars.",1,0,0

One of my friends is a high roller out in Vegas and is either Diamond or Platinum so she gave us her hookups for a free room here in the Octavius tower which is a new addition to this property.

We were arriving late and not able to meet her to get the keys so she left them at the front desk under our name. Should have been easy peasy but when we arrived to pick them up they first wanted our IDs - no big deal so we handed them over. Then they noticed we weren't really anything special and didn't have a Total Rewards card so they wanted to give us a regular room. Um no. So we asked for a manager. The manager gave us some issues so we finally called my friend and she called them, gave them hell and magically we had keys and an extra night to spend, plus some dining credits. Woohoo!

The room itself was fabulous and so was the wait staff etc. Beyond the checkin issues, we really loved having the luxury of the upscale room. The beds were AMAZING!! I had the best sleep of my life and that's saying a lot because I can hardly sleep in hotels but this was just fabulous.

We wanted to stay at Caesars because we were running the Rock 'n' Roll Vegas half marathon and knew that Caesars was the most convenient hotel to the finish line. Plus, it's old school Vegas, so what's not to love?

Lots. After arriving at the hotel at midnight and standing in a long line served by only two employees, we entered our room only to discover the king non-smoking I booked six months early (and paid a deposit on!) had morphed into a queen smoking. A call to the reception desk got us moved to a non-smoking room, but this one was still fitted with queen beds and was an accessible room to boot (bathroom not as nice). The manager who was supposed to contact us never did, so after the second night we took it upon ourselves to request again the room we'd booked (and paid a deposit on!). The third room was very nice, and if we'd been given it when we first arrived, this might be three stars.

Only three stars, you say? Yeah. Caesars nickel and dimed me so bad I was shocked even for Vegas. We paid a (non-optional) $25 daily resort fee for an internet connection that was 512 kb per second (that is, basically not an internet connection at all). Everything was an upcharge, including printing boarding passes at the hotel ($5 per confirmation number). Honestly, I experience more hospitality staying at Courtyard Marriotts and Hyatt Homes on business trips. If I'm paying luxury prices to stay in a luxury hotel, I'd like to feel a little indulged.

We plan on visiting Vegas again, and although we don't know where we'll stay, we certainly know where we won't.",18,4,3

The living room and dining area were huge, as was the master bedroom (ours), with two bathrooms which were connected by the shower..pretty cool.

The rooms were upgraded to a semi-suite on the 44th floor of the brand spankin' new Augustus Towers.

Marble floor bathrooms, flat screen HDTV in the bathroom and over the bed, and jacuzzi tubs.

I was extremely disappointed with how  Caesar's staff handled my lost item. It was a trench coat my mother gave me and has sentimental value that money can't buy. Granted, I will admit it was my fault for being negligent on my part, but their response time was another story. Had they responded right away, I really think that somebody would've found my jacket. Nobody returned my calls literally for 6-7 days in the security department and housekeeping department until I tracked down the Director of Operations and threatened to talk to the GM. First they redirected me to the claims department. Then 2 other departments where I had to retell my story each time and have various security guards look into this. Of course this led nowhere.
 
They finally handed me over to an external claims vendor to ""investigate this issue."" 3 months later, I received a letter from them saying that Caesar's is not liable for my lost item and that this ""case is closed.""

I am angry because we left a very generous tip for the housekeeping staff and the frontdesk staff who upgraded our rooms, and this was not your typical budget weekend. I'd hate to think that any of them (housekeeping, security guards) were responsible and this experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I decided (poorly) to bring my Harrah's play to this hotel. I am a rated Harrah's member, so get the standard RFB comps. After staying at their ""Flagship"" I am honestly thinking about switching to the competition. If this is the best they can do, I need to move to MGM or someplace else that will respect our play better.

I understand I'm not a 7 star rated player... but you never know, I could be one in a few years... I booked a room in the forum tower, smaller and modern decor. When I got in, I was moved to the Roman tower, 3rd floor. My view was of the pipes, outside access staircases and the side of a building. At 2:30 I discovered that the shower was not working, neither was the drain. I called and asked to move. They told me they would send an engineer up to fix it and they were completely booked.

Anyway, after about an hour or so of waiting, and the engineer telling me that he was going to need another 45 minutes to fix it, I asked again to move. All of a sudden they were NOT fully booked and I was moved to an equally old, not renovated mess. 

The only reason I am complaining about a free room here is because of the LYING, the BROKEN SHOWER, and the SHOVING ME IN A FAR WORSE ROOM THAN I CHOSE online. If I knew that was going to happen, I would have stayed at PH like normal.

My host will hear about it, or not, as I may not be back to Harrah's at all.",3,2,0

When I made the reservation, I specified that I will have a small dog with me. In the interim, I received 3 emails from Ceasars. Not one mentioned the dog, so I thought I was all set. 

I was wrong. I tried checking in today, and the manager, Andrew Alicea, an arrogant, off-putting man, informed me that I will need to pay an additional $75 a night on top of my room charge, because I did not inform the hotel in advance that I will be bringing a dog. 

I told Andrew that I did --  I wrote it in the comments section. Andrew said those comments were read by Booking.com and not the hotel... I asked him how was I supposed to know that. He insisted that at the time of the reservation I should have booked a ""pet friendly"" room. It didn't matter that I had no idea that there was even an option of that ilk. 

I told Andrew I was leaving. At first, he said he couldn't rerun my money. Then, he actually looked at the reservation (first time that he did that), and said: ""oh, I can rerun you. You were only charged for one night."" 

I called my bank. I was charged for two nights. Now, I need to figure out how to get credit for the second night. And oh, yeah, I had to find another pet friendly hotel without an advanced reservation, and after driving into Vegas for 5 hours. 

Not fun.

Follow up: I got a call from Andrew's supervisor, a Ms. Morales. She promised to give me a free dog friendly room for two nights whenever I returned to Vegas. I called her three weeks later. I also emailed. Never heard back. Nothing. Nada. Apparently, they seriously don't care about their guests...",1,0,0

TIPS:
Upgrade to the Palace Tower because the other two ""cheaper"" towers are NOT that nice, which is sad because you pay a pretty penny here. If you can NOT stay in the Palace Towers or above stay elsewhere the rooms are NOT cute or worth the money.
 
Parking: Make sure to valet then leave your car there because if you take your car out you will NOT be able to valet again all weekend long even if your staying in the hotel.

This time when we were coming to Vegas, our trip was going to be a family trip So we decided to pay a little more money and book two Palace Tower Deluxe King rooms. I explained to the lady on the phone that we were coming with family so we wanted our rooms close together and we wanted a pool view. She told us that would be no problem and she could accommodate us. 
    On Saturday July 27, 2013 at 1630 we arrived to Caesars Palace. When we first pulled in we were told Valet was full so we could drop off our bags, but would have to park at another location. When we pulled up to valet, my fiancee's mother told the valet that she was a players card holder. The valet said since we have the players card he could park us. When we arrived to check in, Salcala helped us. The first thing she told us was it was kind of early so she wasn't sure if there were any rooms cleaned for us. It was 1651 at this point, so I was very confused since check in time is 1500. I told Salcala that the lady I talked to on the phone told me our rooms would be close together, have a pool view, and be non smoking. Salcala said the closest she could get us was one room on the 24th floor and one room on the 25th floor, but since the rooms were so high up we would get a great view. Salcala also explained that since I was using a debit card she would have to charge a fee of $200 on each room for incidentals.  When I walked into our room (room #2541), the first thing I noticed was the strong smell of cigarette smoke. The next thing I noticed was our view. All we could see was a parking lot and a small section of the Mirage pool. Not only had the lady we booked with told us we would get a pool view, but Salcala told us we would have a great view. A view of a parking lot and part of another hotels pool isn't what I consider a great view. The next thing I noticed was a bottle cap and peanut shells on the floor.  When I sat down to call and complain about the cigarette smell, I smelled a very strong stench of urine by the phone. I called and complained and was told that they could bring in a machine that takes the smell of cigarette smoke out but we would have to leave the room for an hour. We had just arrived and the last thing we wanted to do was have to leave the room for an hour. The lady also told me she could have someone come in and use a spray that would help remove the smell. I told her that would be fine. I was very upset that we couldn't be accommodated any other way, so I called back. I talked to a different lady and she told me again that they could bring something in that would get rid of the cigarette smoke. I told her I had already been inconvenienced and would not be made to leave my room. I told her I expected to be switched rooms. She said there was nothing available to accommodate me. So after all this inconvenience of being on a different floor from my family, having been lied to about the great view we would get, the smell of cigarettes and urine, and the uncleanliness of our room, there was no way we could be accommodated. If it wasn't for my family staying, I would have gone to another hotel. Even with the staff spraying our room, it still smelled, very strongly, like cigarettes the entire weekend. 
    After lunch, we wanted to go to the front desk to get a copy of our bill. The gentleman, STFlores, explained to us that we would be receiving back $91.02 on my fiancee parents room (room# 2423) and $116.00 on our room (room# 2541). We explained to STFlores that we were told we would be receiving back $200 on each room. He explained that in my fiancee's parents room they ordered internet, and we did understand we had to pay for that, but we should be receiving back $200 on our room and $175.01 on the other room. STFlores explained that the resort fees come out of that $200, but we told him that Salcala did not explain that to us. He told us that Salcala was right over there and we could go talk to her. We requested that he have Salcala come to us. She came over to us and we explained the confusion. She said she felt she explained herself correctly because she, ""always explains herself thoroughly to customers"". She went on to tell us all resorts charge resort fees. We explained that we are not trying to dispute the resort fee's, but she did not explain herself in a way that was clear. When we checked in we asked Salcala three times if we would be receiving $200 back for each room as long as we didn't charge anything and she answered yes all three times. Salcala said she was sorry WE didn't understand HER and then stormed off. STFlores didn't ask us how our stay was or if we were satisfied and didn't offer to have us speak to a manager.",6,0,0

This review is mainly to chronicle what a more plebeian stay booked through a deal site like Travelzoo will get you.  I'm not pretending to be naive and crying bait and switch, but those deals like Roman Tower stays starting at $90 usually means a midweek stay with a lousy view.  Never forget also that there are taxes and fees on top of this, including the big one:  the resort fee. We're not ballers or high-rollers, and we were staying 4 nights Fri through Tues so we had no leverage at all.  So what amounted to an offer that starts out sounding like it would be around $360 for the entire stay balloons to about $825 after said taxes and fees are included plus the fact that weekends are always more...

We stayed in the modest Roman Tower, one of the oldest.  Naturally they gave us an offer to upgrade before arriving:

Forum Tower (+20\/night);
Palace Tower (+50);
Augustus Tower (+70);
Octavius Tower (+80);

but we didn't think we would use the rooms for much more than a place to sleep, clean up and get dressed;  besides we thought the savings would be better used towards a dinner at Guy Savoys or the QUA spa.  I may have considered it if we extended our stay longer and more midweek...

The room itself felt spacious and large http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#2R6vPFZ2vR3ZtGb4clCtrg.

The bathroom amenities come from QUA spa so that was nice and also included a separate vanity and a small tv set over the sink though we hardly turned on the tvs during our stay.  It was easy to tell that the room is in one of the older towers since everything seemed a bit tired looking.  The whirlpool function didn't work in the tub either but we weren't expecting one in the first place.  We also had to endure some asshat frat boys who probably had 4 people in their room and were particularly loud nextdoor but we knew they were probably only staying Fri and Sat anyway...

The beds were modestly comfortable, the sheets were not crisp and new but they were clean.  We could have asked for a King bed but at the time I made the reservation, I didn't know if our son was going to join us...

There was a gap under the front door to the room that seemed abnormally large, big enough to stick your toes under if you wanted to which bothered the missus, but it seemed that all the doors (on our floor) were this way and there was an extra strip at the base on the outside to compensate and so we overlooked this too...

Seems like we had to overlook a lot of things just so that we could stay here,  but in the end I felt it was worth it as we took in many of the restaurants downstairs without having to jump into our car, and we would schedule a large portion of one of our days in the spa on site.  Going to the parking lot is also a 15 minute one way trip, so keep that in mind too.  Sure I would have a ""Hangover"" like suite, but I'm sure you can have anything you want if you paid for it.  I also liked their fitness center which had mats for my yoga,  the pools outside were absolutely beautiful, and we enjoyed the close proximity of the forum shops...

So we went to the lobby to see if they could help us fix the problem. The lady who helped us said she would call customer service to come up and fix.

Aside from the fact that I'm a bloke and I am both an avid advocate of and grateful (Believe me.. I am 150% grateful!) for the general consensus that is: ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"".  

Anyway..... This trip being our first time in Vegas, we decided to do it in style and well, it had to be Caesars Palace! Anything else wouldn't have been good enough! We stayed in the Palace Tower and it costs us a bomb for 4 nights but you know what? I had a great time! 

The hotel is massive (it will literally take you close to 10 mins to get to your room if you're in say the Palace Tower from reception) but then again, that's normal in Sin City.

I liked our room - The bathroom was very spacious and we had a great view of the strip. 

The staff that I dealt with were really nice and helpful. The only letdown is that you have to pay for internet, which is a quite rubbish really. I mean most hotels give you at least free Wi-Fi in the lobby so....

We came in by the shopping area. We walked all the way around 3 times until we finally got to the front entrance check in area. There were not signs letting you know where ANYTHING IS. There is some small signs SOMETIMES where you can find SOME stuff but none for restrooms or anything. They need way more restrooms and the only one by the back area is in the food court...food court food was about $12-$15 per person for normal food...the tables were never open only in the high rollers room and in the main place. Our room wasn't bad but needed more lighting. There was no bathtub and the sofa was ripped slightly but that wasn't the main concern. To the Hispanic man with the glasses and an accent at the bar by the nightclub: you are the meanest person I have ever met and I will never get a drink from you or come here again. Someone please talk to this person or remove him...I sat at the bar and just wanted some margaritas while I was playing video poker. So I ordered them and he said he is going to charge me for both. I asked him why and he said I have to play and only have 1 at a time even though my girlfriend was in the bathroom waiting for one. Nothing blended he said..So I said okay then just one for me since I'm playing and he said I can't I have to charge you. He asked for my ID and took out his flashlight and stared at it, then put it up next to my face and compared it to me, and he put my ID down on the table. He said start playing and I'll come back in a little to take your order...so I put in $20 and was playing quarter black jack. He comes back 5 minutes later and I put my hand up for help and he helps the man next to me first so I waited another 5 minutes. He then comes to me and says I need to be playing..and I said I am!!! (I was so pissed off but I did not say anything).. he said I have to be playing $1.00 per hand $20 minimum which I did and I was down to $10.00 so I asked him and said look I'm trying to just get some drinks I tried to raise the bet but the machine wasn't working so he stood there looking like an idiot staring me down and taking a deep breath...he touched my machine and played 4 quarters and said there I have to play that for atleast 10 minutes then he will come back and he left.

I dont ever recommend anyone going to vegas during holiday weekend except thanksgiving and christmas bc it will be packed and everything is more expensive (like buffets) and limited valet access.

During memorial day weekend we got at the Palace tower.
Mostly bc we got there late.
If you have a comp room, make sure to check in as early as possible otherwise you will get stuck with a not so good of a room although you reserved a better one.
I think checking in by 7 or 8p is fine.

Now during Labor day weekend we stayed at the Octavious Tower which is has the best rooms.
In order of best to worst towers are Octavious,
Augustus, Palace, Roman and the Forum Tower.  Nobu is a little different bc its modern style unlike any of their other towers. Posh.

The Oct, Aug and Roman towers are far from self parking.
Registration and valet is the most accessible.
The pool is closest to the palace towers but not bad for most of the other towers as there are side hallways that lead to the pool.

The Forum Tower is very nice (comparable to the Wynn and Bellagio), including service from the time of check in to check out.  The Roman Tower is ok.  In addition, I noticed a disparate treatment (not sure if it is isolated or not) when I stayed at the Roman Tower this time.  To make the story short, not only was service so so, they attempted to downgrade us to a different tower.  However, after logically arguing (how can the rooms be the same when the pricing is different) with them, we got our room at the Roman Tower.

Caesars was my first ""fancy"" hotel and I've stayed at most of the nicer ones on the strip. That being said, overall I think this hotel is the best. 
They have a good range of guestrooms, awesome pools and, to me, The best shopping around (bellagio and wynn are too fancy and planet hollywood and the mall aren't fancy enough).

We've stayed in the Palace and Augustus tower and one of the older ones. The Augustus is the biggest, but the location of the Palace tower is the best because it's slightly closer to the shops and it's right by the pool.  (Since they're building a new tower, access to the pool from the Augustus tower was blocked - we had to walk ALL the way around.)  But even after that setback, I think it's the best bang for your buck since it's not too expensive and the pools are great. It's perfect for us because we like staying in nice rooms but don't gamble like high rollers...so going across the street to Bills or Flamingo is easy for the lower table minimums.

My sister and I had stayed here before when Elton John was supposed to perform and he cancelled the morning of the concert. I thought that was pretty messed up, but decided to stay at Caesars again because the room was free. The ONLY reason I'm giving Caesars 2 stars is because the room was clean and the people that work there are pretty nice. 

Here are the things I did NOT like about Caesar and will never stay there again. 

No wifi? You have to pay $25.00 for wifi, they have wifi EVERYWHERE! Why in the hell should anyone pay for wifi? I thought that was a rip off! The other thing that sucked was they had bottled water in the room for $6.00 each. Down the hall where the vending machine is, the bottles are $3.00. It was the same exact water! 

The gambling there was SAD! Put the money in, nothing comes out. I finally went to other casino's to see if it were any better elsewhere. It wasn't. 

Okay the other thing that I was getting REALLY upset about was every time you walk down the hallway on the casino level there are these stores and the people working in the stores hassle you to take a sample. I finally just would look away and they'd call MADAM MADAM try our free samples. I feel that is SO tacky and I felt like I was being hassled every time I went down that way. It was very annoying!

I didn't feel safe there. Many strange people looming around.

It was not a very good experience. I went to MGM and they advertise that they have free wifi. So IF I ever go back to Vegas, I'll stay there. Any place but Caesars!",0,0,0

It was also hard to control the temperature of the room. It was either like an ice box or an oven. Most of the lighting didn't work in the room which was quite problematic for three girls trying to get ready in one hotel. We all had to cram in the bathroom because there was practically no lighting in the room itself. We even called to tell them about it but it was never fixed. The TV was a POS and was a typical tube TV. I think we must've been stuck in a room that had not been renovated or something.

1. seafood platter (they serve NOT all you can eat style) - skinny crab FROZEN leg, shrimp WITH SKIN - very lame and oyster (but you have to ask if not they will not give it to you).
2. cheap champagne which taste not like champagne.

The first night I shared room with a friend and it was located in the forum tower. They had the reward points and earned two nights free which I thought was great! Their room was pretty nice with a flat screen in the main bedroom and one in the restroom! Called for room service to get some extra towels, toothpaste and covers. They bought it over within 25 minutes. They also includes extra toothbrush and mini mouthwash!!! Awesome!! 

However, the next day when I checked into my room. Located in the roman tower. It was kind of a disappointment because the restroom didn't even have a door! I know!!! I would of complain but I figured, why :\/ I was leaving the next day anyways . Some of my other friends who flew in the very same day got the same package and with my story to them about my room, they told the customer service n got themselves free upgrade. I guess i should of complain right!? Oh well. That's really why I gave it four stars.. Not meeting the expectations. On top of that the requested bed was a king n I ended up getting a queen size. Great right? 

But I do enjoy the customer services and been taking lots of pictures!!!! Love this hotel, compared it to the others n yes.. It's worth the money! Do go a cheap rate if u search around n get promotions code.

K, it's 3a.m.. Maybe I should sleep. Wait.. Who sleeps in Vegas!? Lol",0,0,0

They've built newer towers, but the best location to stay is the Augustus tower, located right by the lobby.  The other towers are located miles away, and frankly its just too far.

They have everything you can ask for.. .the casino, shows, restaurants with celebrity chefs (ie: Flay, Ramsay), and a huge shopping area which has high end stores like LV to affordable stores like Victoria Secret.

The shopping obviously is great. We had to wait 45 minutes in line on a wednesday night only when 4 people were in front of us. Very very slow check-in. Now the people who work at the Hotel is the problem.  At Qua Spa the front people are very rude and unpleasant to their costumers. They told me that i had to get my mother ""in check"" while we were 2 minutes late for our spa day (DO NOT BE LATE). We were 4 people booked for about $160 per person massages (for two days) and that is the way they were treating us, if not the other costumers\/guests as well. They never asked how our stay was going, nothing to make us feel comfortable as they should. And if you are late, your minutes will be deducted from your massage. 

The room we stayed in was nice and very huge!!! Grand piano and all! Didn't really bother me the we had a wall for a view but there were chunks of the walls missing and the room looked as if people tried to destroy it. The 90's tv was mostly static so we couldn't hear or watch it most of our stay..
(If you try to use WIFI it cost $14.99 per computer, per night. Rollaway bed is $30.00 fee a night. Room service is also a 18% gratuity charge.)

Another incident happened twice in the Caesars Palace gift shop. Two times i had went there to buy stuff for the flu i was having at the time. They would not let me charge to the room and was giving me a very hard time. My name was on the room with my parents so i immediately tell them that i was going to the front desk to complain. I did just that and the guy at the front desk apologized and told me there should be no problem. I went back the next day and the same thing happened, unfortunately i was so fed up and sick that i did not feel the need to keep complaining about the poor costumer service. 

As i am still sick with the stomach flu\/strep throat i caught there, i called front desk to help me out so i could go to a 24 hour urgent care. They gave me a number of an operator who informed me that urgent care was not 24 hours. I called the front desk again and had explained what had happened. Front desk this time gives me an address of an urgent care 4 miles away. Got into a taxi and by the time we got there, the urgent care sign said they were not open on weekends WHEN Caesars Palace assured me that it was. By this time i was so ill i had to go to the emergency room and they would not call me an ambulance. I was rolled in a wheelchair into another taxi going to the 3rd hospital, that did nothing for me, and they were not allowed to give me a throat culture or tell me what my fever was at that point. just prescribed me a bunch of drugs and sent me on my way to walgreens so i can wait 2 hours for my prescription while throwing up blood. Worst experience of my life. 


Moral of all of this ..The people at Caesars Palace treat their guests like crap. Everything is also EXTREMELY over priced. Even for people with money. They really like to rip you off and talk down to you. Never staying here again! And never get sick in Vegas..worst healthcare of ALL time.",0,0,0

We were assigned to the Forum Tower, and received a smoking room (Didn't realize this until we got into the room, we don't smoke...). We checked in the hotel around 1am, so I was pretty tired from the flight and just wanted to go bed. We were only there for the weekend, so to me it wasn't worth complaining or requesting a new room for. 

I was personally a little disappointed with our room, it had a small sink, tiny closet that was located in the bathroom, really old stereo system (it had a CD player, LOL) and a stand in shower. 

However on the plus side, it had a cool TV in the bathroom mirror, hair dryer, iron, makeup mirror and a king size bed. 

Caesars is a gorgeous hotel. Only problem is, IT IS SO BIG. It really is easy to get lost in here. But by the third day I think I finally got it down.

You could probably spend your entire trip in Vegas just in this one hotel. They have everything! From great restaurants, Forum shops, sports booking, gambling, Omnia nightclub, and the huge pool area was very impressive!

I am a Total Rewards Diamond Member and was comped several nights in the Augustus Tower.  The room was a standard room, but the LARGEST standard room I've had in LV, at about 650 sq ft.  The Augustus Tower is the best tower to stay in if you want the easiest access to the front entrance that leads to the Strip.  The room was spotless and beautifully renovated.  The hallways leading to the room were almost shockingly pristine, pretty and well-maintained.

The entire resort is beautiful...but almost (for the first couple days of my visit, anyway) overwhelmingly enormous.  There are directional signs scattered throughout, but the layout is confusing and annoyingly maze-like.  At times, I felt like I was trying to navigate the Magic Kingdom, with a property map downloaded on my phone.  

The casino also has a strange layout, as it is scattered here and there and everywhere.  I really don't feel like packing an overnight bag to travel from one slot machine to another.  Not to mention that the ""tightness"" of the slots and video poker here were insane, even by Vegas standards.  I gambled for many hours for 3 days straight and never exceeded more than 200 credits on a single slot or VP machine.

This was also my first time at the famous Bacchanal Buffet.  The food here is great, with lots of dishes you will not find at most any other buffet.  But it was also busy, busy, busy.  Even in the Diamond line, I had to wait about 45 mins. to get in, THEN you have to wait in line at each food section while people SLOWLY take their time without any awareness of the other patrons waiting to get food.  For me, these negatives were not worth the $55 per person admission.

To sum up, I say again that Caesars LV is a beautiful and EXPANSIVE property, but the latter is a bad thing for some people, especially if you are handicapped or traveling with a handicapped family member\/partner.  There is just too much foot\/wheelchair travel within the resort, especially if you want to save your energy for traversing the Strip.

Though I don't like to admit it, I get all excited and giddy days before! I'm not too picky when it comes to hotel accommodations. I've stayed at hotels ranging from Circus Circus to Polo Towers to The Wynn and almost every other hotel in between. But I have never experienced such terrible service as I did at Caesar Palace. 

I had booked 3 rooms for the weekend and was told the rooms will be ready by 4 pm for my friend to check in. By 4 o'clock  only 1 of the rooms was ready. No biggie though, I didn't need the room immediately. At 6:45 pm my sister arrived and tried to check in for the other 2 rooms, front desk told her house keeping was cleaning the other rooms which will take about 10 minutes, the rooms will not be in the same tower with the first one because there are no rooms available and the rooms will not be next to each other. WTHECK?! Really Caesar Palace, is it that difficult to arrange for 3 rooms to be in the same tower at least?! Anyways, 10 minutes roll by still the rooms are not available, 30 minutes later still nothing, 1 hour later still nothing... 9:30 pm and still my other 2 rooms were not available. To make matters worse, I had 8 guests waiting- not able to grab dinner and not able to get ready for the night out! Finally I arrived at 10 pm and was furious because the rooms were ""supposedly"" still not available. After throwing a fit and almost on the verge of throwing the front desk man into the fountain, the rooms were magically available and incidentally next to one another. To make matters worse, they only offered the rooms to be complimentary for the night and an upgrade with kings beds not 2 twins. 
In conclusion, Caesar Palace can offer bad customer service so be aware if you decide to stay here. They overbook the rooms and do not prepared to accommodate their guests when they are over capacity. 

So aside from the whole rooms ordeals, I don't think I can stay at Caesars Palace in the future again because the rooms definitely need some upgrading, the selection of food\/places to dine at are minimal, wow it's quite a trip from the parking lot to the hotel and Oh Yea, service can be a hit or miss.

Atmosphere:
This hotel is situated in the perfect location - right on the middle of the strip..

We originally booked a luxury room in the Augustus tower and we were upgraded to a Octavius luxury room. I was a bit hesitant to go with the upgrade because I was set on having a view of the Bellagio fountains but the lady that checked us in reassured us it was an upgrade. We were upgraded to the 60th floor with a view of the pools. I was very please with the view.

Room was clean and everything worked perfectly.

Typical pool hours however it can vary. I think I saw a sign for the upcoming Saturday closing at 5pm - I'm assuming for a pool party.

Service:
The hotel staff were absolutely amazing whenever we actually interacted with them. Housekeeping did a perfect job - even neatly stacking my shoes off to the side of the wall.

Dining:
Probably one of the better hotels in regards to the dining selections available on property. We only ate off of the hotel on several occasions.

Check-Out:
We did online check-out vs. counter and it worked flawlessly.

Check-In:
When we arrived around 730pm there was a large group of people in the lobby waiting to be checked in. Of course there is a separate line for the diamond and seven-star members but I wouldn't know about that life. It took us an hour from end of line to check-in. Saving grace -  I wish I had the name of the lady that checked us in because her keyboard skills were amazing. From walk-up to check-in took us maybe 5mins.

So my review is my trip here and maybe a few things in memory lane.   

The casino, itself, is a good place to gamble.  Plenty of action if you are seeking it.  I have won and lost here.  

The rooms are pretty nice, especially when you upgrade them.  I like that the bathroom and the toilet is separate room.  The toilet is actually a water closet, hahaha.  I had an upgrade and it had an amazing water jets tube, and you can actually stay in your room to relax and let the bubbles take your worries away.  The bed was super comfortable.  Tv was already.

Food is a hit or miss, so do your research.  I say do Spagos, and not Serendipity.  If you got money burning if your pockets from all the winnings.  You can hit the stores.  There is still couple of good ships in there.  A couple of years ago, it was the place to shop, but now there are better places like City Center, or the shops at  the Venetians.  it is up to you.  Still great experiences here.

Also if you have time.  You should hit up the swimming area.  Great place to hang and catch a few laps or just read a book.  It is a nice Roman inspired watering hole filled with statues.

I booked TWO months in advance for a SUITE at Nobu that could host several of my friends for an unforgettable birthday weekend. Not just any rinky-dink room but a huge suite that I was incredibly so excited for - I brought almost 20 friends with me so you can say that I absolutely was ecstatic. 

The DAY OF my stay, Caesars told me they double-booked my suite, told me there was nothing they could do, used the excuse that it was an extra busy weekend even though I booked two months in advance and I was literally stripped of this suite because they don't know how to schedule and organize properly!

From the pictures, it looked like an amazing and beautiful room. I was sooooooo beyond angry - everyone I talked to at Caesars was less than pleasurable! Excuse after excuse, tried giving me a room that cost MORE than what I'd originally booked.

This was my BIRTHDAY weekend. Although I still had an amazing group of friends to support me and made my trip worth going for, this was an awful turn of events. Never staying here again.",0,0,0

The room was spacious, but a bit worn. Amenities were few and far between. Apparently you need to upgrade to a suite to even see a flat screen television. Lighting was kind of awful in the room, too. Bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was much larger than I had anticipated. TV in the bathroom was a nice touch, but that just made me wonder why they couldn't spring for a decent TV in the main room.",1,0,0

I played the roulette table in their pussy cat dolls section, they had strippers dancing on poles in front of the tables. The girl at the roulette table,named aileen was the,best she keeped the drinks coming I played for 2 hours and had a great time doing it.

Before writing this letter I thought to myself, is it really worth the time and stress? I pick my battles wisely and try to minimize unnecessary stress but this experience is still bothering me. I have always trained my staff to provide immediate feedback, to never suffer in silence. In this case I did, but my feedback was not appropriately addressed; this was a common trend within the staff at Caesars Palace. I tried to start the process by talking to the persons who were responsible and most able to help, but as you can see it has now become necessary to come up the ranks because of their failure to act and follow-through.

Caesars Palace Las Vegas should not promise more than they can deliver. 

I visit Las Vegas multiple times throughout the year and I have never had a reason to provide feedback due to a hotels inability to provide basic customer service. There is a reason I use feedback instead of complaint, because I always give the opportunity to make things right after receiving feedback.

Treated in a shameful manner at check-in

Given the wrong room

After complaining nothing resolved

Placed in a smoking room, after making two request for a Non-Smoking room

No telephone call received to discuss concerns with a member of the management team for 72 hours. 

Medical concerns not addressed

Security taking a report and not following-up 

Rude

Condescending

Dismissive

Abrupt

Not compassionate

Not Sympathetic

Failure to follow-through

Unbelievably poor customer service

Failure to be accountable",0,0,0

It's a huge hotel complex-bigger than I imagined. We stayed in the Palace tower which had easy access to the pools, which are great. Our room was fine. Everything about a Caesars is expensive. Gambling, food, drinks, snacks, sports book, meals, etc. you can get better prices elsewhere, but I knew what I was getting in for. We checked our bags on Sunday and enjoyed the pool the rest of the day before our flight and that worked well. Don't ask for extended checkout, because you won't get one. Staff all were helpful. I don't need to go back because there are so many other fine places to stay is Las Vegas.",0,0,0
