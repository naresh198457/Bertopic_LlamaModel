We were able to sit right down 10:45 on Saturday morning. On Saturday they serve brunch all day. The brunch menu is different from the breakfast menu, but isn't listed online. It gets really loud in there because of the echo. The coffee is great unlike many other breakfast places. I ordered the benedict and the eggs were perfect. The turkey bacon is flavorful and ample. The hollandaise is just right, hint of citrus. It's also loaded with cooked spinach, yessss. When I first saw my plate I was worried that it may not be enough food, but I walked out completely full. My husband thought the same thing when he saw his plate of pancakes, but he too was full. The pancakes are thin and are legitly homemade. They pile them high serving it with a tiny jar of syrup. Very good, but doesn't beat Dupar's. Our food companion ordered huevos motulenos with an extra side of green chilies. It was an insane amount of food and he sweat through his shirt. I also wanted to say how nice the bathroom is. Clean, private and well stocked.

The place was about half full, but most of that was a large group that pushed together 3 tables in the middle of the place.  It's not huge, but has a patio which seemed nice, although I ate inside the restaurant.  

Service was very quick.  I had the shrimp po boy.  I'll say, I was excited to try the chicken fried steak.  I had heard great things and was the reason I went.  But, they stop serving breakfast at 11:00 or so.  So, that was a disappointment.  

I was fortunate, because the po boy was excellent.  The ciabatta was maybe the softest version of this roll I've ever eaten.  Despite this, it held up to the toppings.  It wasn't overflowing with shrimp, but you got shrimp in about 85% of the bites.  The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the sauce was spicy.  They should bottle it, it added so much.  The homemade potato chips were good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall, very cool atmosphere.  Friendly people and a great lunch.  I'll have to get downtown earlier to try the CFS for breakfast...",1,0,1

Overall, great place! Not sure I'd go out of my way too often to dine here, but I will definitely be back. 

I had the breakfast sandwich (oops, I forgot the name, but the menu is simple).  It was a ciabatta bun, egg, applewood bacon, feta, and truffle oil sautéed mushrooms.  Served with a side of fresh cooked potatoes. The flavors were awesome, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients....and some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever tasted (usually I won't eat them)!

The service was great, and the staff is friendly. Every server said hello to me or checked my drink refills at least once while I ate. Not everyone likes that constant attention while eating, but I loved it. It was my first time there, but I felt like I was a neighborhood regular! WOW! What an impression...kudos to the staff!

Parking in the area is kind of a hassle and you will usually have to pay, but it's not too much of a big deal.  I also might like to see more variety in the menu options, but I'll have to see if the menu changes on my next visit to (eat.).",0,0,0

Condiment plate is the centerpiece with assortment of sweeteners.  The menu is presented on a clipboard. I had the passion fruit iced tea.  It was unsweetened tasted freshly brewed and refreshing. Read the reviews here and ordered the common suggested shrimp and grits as well as killer grilled cheese.  The server warned us they are known for food to arrive right away and there might be a bit of delay.  Service was on point, everything arrived in a timely manner. They were plated nicely.  The grits were topped with shrimp hidden underneath a pico de gallo like salsa.  It was good but maybe not my taste to crave again. The grilled cheese looked great made with thick toast. The tomato soup we asked to have with it was thick. The menu lists tomato salad.  Just the right amount of cheese!  Like this one!  Our bill came out to $32 for two drinks and two plates.

Bonus point for being located in the most random old hotel\/motel off 7th.
The brunch menu is small, but good. We sampled the eggs benedict (I can't remember the name, but it was really good. Canadian bacon, spinach, etc...), beignets (yum! not for the paleos, of course!), and the biscuits and gravy. All were hits.
Service was friendly and prompt and all the employees were happy to greet our toddler.
The prices for food were reasonable (~$10 for a bfast entree), but I agree with Karlie that the drink prices were kinda high. I think my OJ was almost $5.

I don't think the shrimp and grits would've been that bad if the shrimps were fresh. The shrimps is what killed it for me. Overall, the dish is a 2 out of 5.

The pancakes, however, is a 5 out of 5. They're the BOMB(dot)COM. If you're going to eat., get the PANCAKES. Screw the shrimp and grits. The pancakes are worth the drive.

Came here in a group of five at approx. 11am on a Sunday. Told the hostess party of five and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. We decided to wait, lest we leave and spend the same amount of time finding another restaurant. 
Nearly an hour later, we asked the hostess for a status update, to which she told us she had called us and we did not respond. 
What she actually meant was, despite each of us making eye contact with her like little puppies, she called for a party of four, which of course we didn't respond, being a party of five, and she moved down her list. 
So after watching the hostess seat everyone else, we asked how much longer to be seated. Another girl (manager?) came over and basically treated our friend like she was in the wrong for not answering to ""party of four"" since that's what the hostess meant - us.

We were seated next, waiter was nice, and the food came out quickly (maybe they rushed it for us?). Otherwise they never really acknowledged that they fudged up. 

All this being said, the food was pretty good. I had their grilled cheese - you can't really mess up a grilled cheese (note: the bread slices on everything were wicked thick). 

So 3 stars because the food was good, but nothing special, and the hostess was apparently only somewhat competent.

My family and I arrived at eat around 9 a.m. On Friday morning. Just so you know, if you go on a Saturday or Sunday, you are going to have a wait. Up to an hour in most cases so be patient. The menu is small, but mighty.  I would say that the menu is eclectic and foodie friendly. 

The star of the menu is the deviled eggs in my view. The hard boiled egg is deep fried, then the yolk mixture is put in the center as usual, but then a little bit of Sriracha is drizzled on top and then to kill it, carmelized onion is added. You get 4 for $8.00. I could eat several plates if they were put in front of me, but you know what happens when you eat too many eggs. Lol For my main dish, I had the Chicken Fried Steak. It was breaded perfectly and had a rich brown gravy on it. It was served with potatoes and eggs cooked to your liking. I suggest over medium. That way, you can cut into the egg and mix it up with the potatoes and a little bit of the steak. My mom had the specs oak of the day, which was a soft boiled egg, wrapped sausage(yes, sausage) then deep fried. It was served with pancakes. It was incredible. My mom loved the pancakes and said they reminded her of my grandma's greasy pancakes. The coffee is really good as well. 

The decor is industrial and the restaurant itself isn't very big. The service is good and attentive. Parking is available on the street for $2.00 for an hour. You have to pay at the parking kiosk on the curb. I have never really had trouble finding parking, but I can imagine it can be tough at times. 

I feel like eat is very much a local place and not so much a touresty place. At least not yet anyway.",0,0,0

The place is bigger than it looks from the outside and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  The host staff was doing a great job. Got to see them deal with a very disgruntled lady and they handled it very well.  We got to sit over by the kitchen which was bustling and sending out plates super fast. The service was great, they got our drinks as soon as we sat down and our server Roberto was very attentive and the rest of the staff made sure we had everything we needed.  I'm a huge tea drinker and always judge the service by how well they keep up with me. My iced tea was never empty no matter how much i drank.

 I had the chicken fried steak and got to sample a bit of my wife's pancakes. The potatos were just right with a nice layer of crispy goodness.  The steak was very good and the gravy had a little kick to it.  The toast is seriously 2 inches thick and I'm pretty sure they prepare it on a griddle. Only miss for me was the poached eggs, they were overcooked so didn't have the yolk to dip the toast in. The pancake I sampled was light and fluffy so I'm putting that on deck for my next visit.

Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet.",0,0,0

Far removed from the Food network portraitures and triple digit price points of your typical strip-side steakhouse, tapas bar or italian eatery this down to earth downtown cafe is a refreshing change of pace for the adventurous LV visitor.  

The menu offers some familiar treats done right and some not so familiar items for the more daring of palettes.  Firstly, the pancakes were praised by everyone at my table for their perfectly crispy edges.  The beignets were warm and soft, as fresh as any Bourbon street bakery, and served with sweet homemade jam and mascarpone.  My dish, the Huevos Motulenos, was an inspired new take on the classic huevos rancheros, with the addition of banana (a subtle addition mind you) making this one of the more memorable and unique breakfast dishes I've had the pleasure to try.

Natalie, the chef and owner of eat., was in the kitchen for most of our visit cranking away on orders and running the staff but we had the pleasure of catching her taking a much deserved break on the bench out front on our way out.  She was happy to chat with us for a bit and I'm happy to say embrace us with as much warmth and authenticity as her menu exemplifies.  

I look forward to any future endeavors Natalie brings to this lonelier Las Vegas neighborhood and hope to return to eat. in the future for more tasty culinary delights.

My husband wanted to go to Ellis Island, always a safe choice and unfortunately, would've probably been better off going there. 

So to start, it's downtown. Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around-- deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9:00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us. 

SERVICE: We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok. Server finally made his way over to our table and he was a borderline D. We were greeted with a very bland ""Ready to order or do you need more time?"", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice.

SHRIMP & GRITS: Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp & Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits  muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment. 

CHICKEN FRIED STEAK: Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it.

PASSION FRUIT ICED TEA: The best part of my meal. WTF.

AMBIANCE: Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal. Menu's presented on clipboards, urban chic decor, great idea and if we went by ambiance alone, then this place would be 5 stars! Too bad, so sad it's not.",8,3,1

So we go into this place that closes in 45 minutes (2:00pm) and we are seated with an effortless menu in our hands.  If you have seen the 90's movie ""My Cousin Vinny"" then you had a choice of:
Breakfast 
or
Lunch
I had the lunch, my mother had the lunch, and my sister had the breakfast.  The prices were steep for no apparent reason.  I'll tell you why.  
This ""cafe"" sits behind the newly constructed Container Park near the downtown area and gives off no connection to the ""urban"" look that the whole community is looking for.  If this place is not known by word of mouth then one would think it was an old relentless leasing place trying to scrape money to stay and keep its doors open. You would also think it has been here at least since the early 80's.
Good for them for putting their name out there by social media, but I honestly don't see how this is going make it for long.  The food screams help at the top of its lungs because they are in desperate need of taste, flavor, and palate cleansing.  With a menu that only has maybe and I mean MAYBE 3 or 4 choices for lunch or breakfast that their descriptive plate names would coincide with the food that you get. I feel like the kitchen is saying, ""heh heh heh, just kidding no soup for you and if you want pico de gallo then cut up your own tomato.""  Yes folks, I asked for pico de gallo but all I got was chopped up tomatoes in a ginormous bowl with one scoop of pico in it (i got charged $.50 for one scoop of a tomato!!) So anyways, we get our food and it is simply not- that- great.   I could've easily gone to one of the local casinos that always advertises steak and eggs for $4.99 or even pancakes for cheaper price.  
However, the point of going to this place was to seek out some truth that lies behind the whole commutative urban development surrounding the newly improved downtown area.  This new area is supposed to cater to the locals that is why they replenished and rejuvenated this whole neighborhood in the first place.  Well, hello, I did expect the prices to be more for me, the local, not the tourist.  
It doesn't matter anymore, what does matter is that if you want to keep your high prices and rip off your customers from not serving urban stylish food than don't stay open too long, and move to the strip where you can rip off all the tourist you want.",0,0,0

The atmosphere is modern, the staff are kind (sometimes slow), the food is always amazing. I don't think I've had one thing bad here. However, the prices are a bit high. But then again, it's the only place around where the food is made from scratch. Their homemade potato chips and potato salad are insanely good. I don't normally go for mayo on anything, but it's absolute perfection. Their posole is amazing (love that it's clear broth and not red), Reuben sandwich is amazing, breakfast foods are perfection and those potatoes. This is definitely a comfort food place to go, if you want to take a nap afterwards. No joke!!  It's unbelievable. Pricey, but worth it. I guess. If you don't have the money, you should probably stick with Taco Bell and don't complain about how much it costs. The owner(s) probably want to buy a bigger house, put their kids through college and they have something really amazing here, so why the heck not!!  The prices haven't hindered the majority of clients from going here. So be mindful of what you order. Also know, if you're on a budget, I believe they have an ala cart menu and you can purchase 2 to 3 things and keep it under $10.

I ordered the truffled egg sandwich with avocado and it was cooked to perfection.  The ciabatta bread alone was a must try, and accompany that with the fresh ingredients to create a great meal.

Come see us at the table next time... a simple apology from the Chef, himself, would have been nice.

My family and I have eaten at eat twice now. Once for brunch and once for lunch. Ill start with our brunch experience:
3 out of 4 of us ordered chicken fried steak. I ordered shrimp and grits. I had their iced tea and it was delish served with an orange slice and mint. Now I LOOOOOVE tea so to be wowed by my usual beverage was awesome.  We shared beignets and they were FABULOUS. I see a lot of reviewers claim they're greasy\/oily and that is far from the truth. They're topped with powdered sugar if they were greasy the sugar would be clumpy or at least look wet. They were delicious. The chicken fried steak was the best I had ever tasted and I regret not ordering it too. My shrimp and grits was tasty however the pico de gallo was overwhelmingly onion-y and I hate onions so maybe had I had no pico I would have enjoyed it more. Our service wasn't stellar however it didn't put us off either. 

Now on to lunch. We decided to go and try out their sandwiches and have some still NOT OILY beignets. Our server greeted us and got our drink orders a dr. Pepper, apple juice, and 2 iced teas. He came back without a tea and a water instead. Little mix up no prob. Our tea wasn't garnished boo hoo ""( still nice flavor.... my daughter received a small glass of apple juice instead of the glass bottle it had come in on our previous visit. I wonder what happened to the rest of her Apple juice. I ordered our beignets and we waited and waited. Got our beignets and devoured them, stacked the plates, and waited. He came over apologizing and said the PC'S were down okay technical glitch I understand. We ordered the free range chicken sandwich, a reuben, a grilled cheese, and a DWblta. Our food didn't take too long and my chicken sandwich while not having a TON of flavor I could taste how fresh each component was. My mom and her wife loved the reuben and blta. My daughters grilled cheese was supposed to come with a tomato salad and chips and while they clearly put ALOT more chips then the rest of us the salad was missing. I would have said something had our waiter ever come back to check on us....my daughter didn't like the sandwich at all. The bread was way too big. Like an inch of bread with a thin layer of cheese then an inch of bread. We decrusted the sandwich then squished it down and she still barely ate more than 3 bites. She didnt even put a dent in tge chips either. When our waiter finally came back he offered us a box and I let him know about the sandwich his response was ""do you want me to take it off?"" I replied ""yes, as you can see she didnt eat any if it."" He took her plate and left. He came back saying they would take half off. I'm not one to argue so I said thats ok. This 2nd trip put a big sour taste in our mouths in terms if service. I feel very let down because I was telling people to go try eat!!!",2,0,0

Other reviewers mentioned that the chicken fried streak is only served until 11, however our server said it was available all day on their brunch menu. We had the chicken fried steak and the huevos montulenos. Each came with a hearty portion of country potatoes and the chicken fried steak came with toast. Do yourself a favor and ask for jelly. The strawberry jelly they brought was delicious and fresh. Both dishes were good and totally different so it's hard to pick a favorite between the two. I was surprised that I did enjoy the sweetness of the banana in the huevos montulenos. The banana and the peas are what made the dish unique.

This establishment is downtown in a pretty rough area. It is behind the container park. It is one of those cool sexy new restaurants downtown. The staff is made up of a bunch of edgy hippie types. It's got a cool vibe to it. When you're there you feel hep. It's usually fairly crowded but they move people through quickly. 

The food is unbelievably good. It is made fresh with the highest quality ingredients. You can really taste the difference. For example they used real maple syrup on their pancakes, fresh fruit, and thick applewood bacon. Who does that these days? Real maple syrup! Unbelievable!

Anyway, I would give them 5 stars except for the service. Maybe it is just the nature of the beast from being so successful but they can be somewhat aloof and no-nonsense to move the people through.

Be sure to give this place a try if you are looking for a great restaurant downtown.",0,0,0

I've worked in the restaurant industry and the staff here really made my dining experience exceptional. I came in with my parents and they enjoyed their meals: oatmeal and an egg dish. I had the tofu scramble and although it wasn't the best, it wasn't bad. They do need to kick that up a notch and add more vegan friendly dishes on the menu (I had to ask for the tofu scramble because it wasn't on the menu when I arrived yet it was on the menu online). The menu said it came sautéed with onions, peppers and mushrooms and I assumed it would be firm tofu scrambled but it was fried squares with little flavor and no onions or peppers (I told them to hold the mushrooms). The potatoes were delicious and so was the very thick cut toast! Yum! I will definitely be back next trip to Vegas but hope to see more vegan items on the menu.",1,0,0

Stopped into Eat after running the Bubble Run with my wife and her cousin and family. Being that this was a Saturday morning the place was already busy and the runners added even more to the crowd. We had about a half hour wait but didn't mind. 
Once all seven of us were seated our orders were taken quickly. My wife and I ordered three entrees between the two of us. What can I say, we wanted to try it all. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Country Fried Steak, and Huevos Motulenos. Everything was extremely tasty. Eggs Benedict was good, The Chicken Fried Steak was pretty good, the highlight being the potatoes, and the Huevos Motulenos was amazing. The Chile sauce on top was excellent. It had to be homemade with that rich smokey flavor. I haven't had peas and bananas go so good together since I was weened off of Gerber. Just a really great combo of sweet, savory, and spicy mixed in with egg yolk. Yum!
One star deduction because our server was slightly less than pleasant, perhaps from the business, but that shouldn't be a factor especially when business equates to more tips. Anyway, good fun meal. I wish nothing but future success to Natalie Young and crew.",1,1,1

That does not speak to how good the food is, so I will say directly that it is downright delicious.  It's definitely comfort food.  During our week in Vegas, we ate breakfast here three times.  The servers are offbeat types, and the decor seems to invite hipsters, so beware of pretentious hipsters, but we didn't do much about it except laugh a bit.
From the chicken fried steak (eat the potatoes with ketchup, they taste much better), to the shrimp and grits (cheese or no cheese, both good), to the Kat's deviled eggs (deep fried and unlike any other deviled egg you've had), to the eggs chilaquiles, the food was prepared with an attitude of indulgence.  
Basically dishes cost around $15.  I was not a fan of the coffee.  The servers were friendly, although one of our waiters behaved more like an actor trying to make an impression than anything else.  Overall, huge recommendation for this place.  It closes at 3pm I think.  We did not have to wait on any of the mornings we went, but we also tend to get up early (it opens at 8am).

It's already sounding like my kind of place with a strong ethos for community and quality.

The banner says, ""eat.  A breakfast and lunch place."" was actually a breakfast THEN lunch place. Wish I knew before  going down there that they do not serve both together. Weekdays breakfast is stopped at 11am, then lunch until 3pm. Weekends is brunch until 2pm.  

We order up the killer grilled cheese since that was sounding good to the BF. The tomato soup it came with was really good. It was a bit cheesy and creamy and like there was chunks of tomato in it, not just puree, which I prefer. The grilled cheese was just OK, though I generally will enjoy thick buttery toast. Nothing mindblowing.

I couldn't decide between the shrimp po boy or the pot pie and chose the chicken pot pie since it sounded good to the BF. I blackjacked on the wrong one. The flavor was decent, but as I got to the bottom there was soggy crust that absorbed all of the sauce from the filling and made the filling thicker than pot pies normally are. The top was crunchy enough and it would have been better if they just did the top and skipped the bottom crust as it won't crisp right in a thick and shallow ramekin. The egg on top was over medium-hard and had a bit crisp burnt edges and wished it was yolky good. The salad it came with was very light and fresh though. Very fresh mixed greens, shredded carrot, sprouts, tomatoes. 

As much as I wanted to love the food here, soup and salad shouldn't have been the best part and nothing impressed my socks off.

Also, I thought for $4 for ice tea, it would taste better or be unique passionfruit. It was standard tropical ice tea flavor, but it had that oversteeped taste so I didn't really clamor for refills.

Service was on the cusp of adequate. It was odd how quiet our server was. I asked for something and he just made the slightest of nods and walked away to another table which left me a bit thinking if he was gonna get it or not. He did end up bringing me some hot sauce. He just put the check on the table, no acknowledgement or asked if there was anything else, while we were eating or checking to see if we want our ice tea topped. He wasn't mean, but I guess wasn't friendly either. Seeing their website talking about the importance of people, you'd think this would be the warmest just-like-home service spot. 

I see that the hype and the love is for breakfast or weekend only items. If stuff like the shrimp and grits, the huevos montulenos and eggs benedict (weekends only) gets people talking this place up, then have that magic stuff available always!  I don't get why the switch in menus considering this place is open only until 3pm weekdays. Vegas is a nightlife industry so you would think they would try to catch as much local support as possible and have breakfast for swing shift and graveyard, not just the AM folks who work at the government buildings in downtown. 

The menus are small that combining it would be 20 items. It's not impossible to make breakfast items as well as salads and sandwiches of the lunch menu. I get simplifying to make it easy to prepare, but then I would expect it to just KILL that execution and flavor when you're making a pot pie special, 5 sandwiches and plating already cooked soup and mixing salads. With small menus you would expect a jes ne sais quoi with everything you order. If they were to have breakfast items all day, I would maybe give it a chance again before heading into work. 

I'm so so sad I had to rant instead of rave of this place. I started this review as a 3star, but it felt more suited to a 2star by the end of it. I haven't been this disappointed in a long while. This much talked about breakfast will have to elude us then. I just don't see us making the effort to wake up outside of our sleep pattern to be here early for a place that left us with doubt.",10,2,2

We went in around 10:30am on a weekday because this place gets really busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours. We got our bill and put 2 cards for them to split the check. They ran both cards and included a note about check splitting, i.e. ""Dear check splitters, when we are slammed we will only take one card per table."" I found this note after-the-fact quite rude, especially since they were not slammed. I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy. The policy was posted nowhere prior to paying our bill, nor was the note there when they brought us the check. I find this to be a ridiculous policy as far as customer service goes, but what was the point of telling us AFTER they split the check. Was this meant to ""shame"" us? If they are trying to let us know for ""next"" time, no worries with the multitude of restaurants available in Las Vegas, neither one of us will ever go back, that was so rude.",0,0,0

Beware it does get pretty crowded around breakfast and lunch time, OK so it's crowded all of the time, but it is worth it. I have been here a couple of times and my major pain point is that they don't serve breakfast all day, I mean they are only open until 3! 

The pancakes are probably some of the best I have ever eaten. They are slightly crispy around the edges and perfectly fluffy in the middle. You didn't even know that you liked your pancakes crispy along the edges, but you do, trust me, you do! The Beignets are absolutely divine. I want to bathe in the vanilla-scented mascarpone, seriously we almost fought over it. The truffled egg sandwich also has so much more flavor than it advertises, super yummy!

As another customer service individual I can be more understanding of a guest's feelings since it is all subjective and sometimes taken out of context.

Guests make your business and to treat  a patron the way I was treated left me with a bad taste in my mouth that even the wonderful food could not take away.

Decided to try this place out. Located close to Fremont St. Street parking isnt too bad. $1 an hour pretty much to park at a meter. I got here around 915am. Though there were plenty of people inside already Im glad we made it before it got even busier.

Ordered two appetizers since I wasnt sure how big portions were and I wasnt too hungry. This place takes Deviled Eggs onto a whole new level. Deep fried deviled eggs was worth the order and the picture. Actually wished I had more room for a second order lol. The consistency was light and crunchy. I loved how there was different flavors giving each bite a bit of a kick to it. Very delicious and very well presented.

The warm strawberry compote cinnamon biscuits were amazingly delicious. Im not really a biscuit persoj but the texture of the biscuit was just perfect. Not too sweet or salty. Really hit the spot with just the right amount of cinnamon & strawberries. This appetizer was actually a big portion. Good enough to feed 3-4 people in my opinion if shared into smaller portions. But if ordering for yourself..  its enough to be a plate on its own.

We purposely ordered different items so that we could try them all.  They were all delicious, fresh, and made with quality ingredients.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's in a sketchy neighborhood, but inside it's filled to capacity with downtown hipsters. Seating was quite limited so I opted to sit at the lunch counter. Not a great choice because I spent my whole lunch impeding the flow of waitresses and listening to the expediter shout orders. I kept thinking I should lend a hand and plate some food or deep fry something.

The food itself is good. I had the roast beef sandwich, potato salad and iced tea. The quality of the ingredients was above average, and they seem to take care with presentation and little added touches. But the price was what stopped me dead in my tracks. $16.50 plus tip for a sandwich, side and a drink. Ouch! I hadn't planned on spending $20 on lunch, and if I had, I would have gone someplace better.

I have not stopped thinking about this place since and how desperately I need one in L.A.

The Eggs Benedict were spot on. It's a menu item that many places carry and many places fall short and EAT did not. And on top of that, the breakfast potatoes were full of flavor. Usually the sides are just filler, but not these. It was hard to decide which food to eat next, do I focus on the eggs benny and hope I have room for the potatoes or do I alternate bites in hope that I won't get full before the end--oh the pressure! I have never wanted to not be full in my life. I wanted to eat all the eggs benny forever and ever amen.

I also had an iced coffee. I can't recall the name of the coffee they carry, but it was fantastic. No gross after taste. So then brings another dilemma, do I sip the coffee and enjoy it or do I just chug it because it's so freaking good.

My husband got a sandwich (can't remember the name) and it too was tasty. And their homemade chips on the side, whaaaaaattttt?! Much thin many flavorful. 

We headed there Sunday Brunch-ish and it was a 15 minute wait, but the entire staff worked hard to make sure our food didn't take forever. And all the waiters were very attentive.

My shrimp and grits was phenomenal, especially paired with the sourdough toast served with the meal. Within the shrimp and grits were two fried eggs that were cooked perfectly to my specification. Each bite was an explosion of flavor that my tongue begged for more. ;) Everyone in my party was pleased with their meal -- my uncle mentioned that the cut of meat was a little tough, but still good. 

Again, I recommend this place for anyone wanting to get off the Strip and experience another side of Vegas. Please come here. Your taste buds will thank you.",1,0,2

The decor is that sort of new modernist industrial, lots of wood and metal, bare bulbs, etc. as I enjoy this ascetic, it worked for me. I was solo, so immediately got a stool at the counter, and within a minute had my coffee and water, and less than five minutes after placing my order, had my food. Fast, friendly service!

I'm docking one star because my only complaint was the food. I got the Chicken Fried Steak, which came with eggs, potatoes, and toast. The toast slices were thick and delicious. The potatoes were solid, so too the eggs. My only minor complaint was the CFS. Being from the south, I'm a bit of a perfectionist for this dish. The fried batter came out just a tad too soft; I prefer a crush. As this is a personal preference, I don't dock it too much, but that's what keeps this place slightly from getting ready a full 5 star from me.

That said, I saw some of the other dishes people next too me order, and I could imagine some of their more specialty dishes earning the full 5.",2,1,1

There were cool, huge black and white photos hung on the walls.  Our waitress was really nice and suggested a few items off their menu. I really wanted to have their breakfast menu but we missed it, since they stop serving it at 11am.  

Anyways, I got the veggie bahn mai with a side of potato salad and my friend and I split their black bean chili.  The baguette was so deliciously buttery and crispy at the edges and the veggies was served in sort of like a slaw: 4\/5. The soup was ok. I kinda wish it was a little spicier and it also came out a little cold: 3\/5. I also liked the fact that they carried organic juices.

Usually, I don't have issues...but this place has gotten more positive reviews than it deserves.  I kind of depend on YELP reviewers to help me decide where I'm going to spend my hard earned cash or in this case, cash I won at the casinos. 
 
Our table ordered several dishes and we all shared. 

The Chicken Fried Steak was amazingly tough given the fact that the inexpensive cut of beef was tenderized!       The dwblta was served with a very hard, unripe, and inedible avocado.    The ""made to order"" beignets came to the table fresh out of the fryer.  They ""looked"" very good.  Unfortunately, they were very dense and really needed a lot of jam and mascarpone to give enough flavor.   I'm not sure whether they were really ""made to order"" or just ""refried "" to order.  The Huevos Motulenos dish wasn't too bad....actually not bad at all, but the potatoes were tasteless.  
 
The coffee was good.  But, the mug it came in looked as if it had been previously used.  Coffee drips were on the front and back of the mug....not necessarily from someone drinking from it...but none the less, not a clean looking mug.  Later, I asked some server walking by to get me a clean mug, and without hesitation did so and filled it with fresh coffee.    

We asked for an extra plate and got the smallest plate possible.  So, we asked again and finally received one after a wait.  We asked for extra jam and immediately got the jam, as well as attitude from some tattooed server\/cashier.
   
The servers were many...in fact there were so many different ones coming to our table to do things (two to take our order, two others to serve, another one to get the plate, and yet another one to bring the attitude, and still another to bring the check or it could have been the same one....bottom line it would be nice to have just one who tends to our table.   (BTW, our initial servers who took our order were out the door by 9ish that morning. We couldn't figure that one out.  Maybe that was why it seemed we had so many different servers plus it appeared some were in-training.)   I paid and left a small tip because not every server there was lacking ""good waiter"" qualities.  

There are so many restaurants competing for our business and thanks to YELP it makes it a little easier to decide.  But it is unfortunate when customers don't take the time to critique bad experiences.  What we experienced today does not appear to be a one time thing.....but a lack of control over the quality and preparation of the food and the disregard for its customers experience.  I was disappointed that I wasted my money and  I will  NOT be coming back to this restaurant.",3,1,0

After reading the reviews on YELP, we chose this restaurant based on the unique menu items that sounded really yummy. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from Fremont Street. I am going to tell you now, even if it was a one hour walk to get there, the food is worth it. We went about brunch time  and were seated almost immediately by very friendly staff. I chose the corn beef hash, my wife the truffled egg sandwich, and la kat's deviled eggs to share. OMG! The deviled eggs are absolutely scrumptious and worth the visit alone. The portions are huge and either the egg sandwich or corn beef hash could easily feed two for a light meal.

Excellent, Awesome, and Terrific, would be a good mnemonic device to remember this wonderful restaurant. Here are three reasons why I liked the place so much:

1) The food was EXCELLENT! I had the Bánh Mì Sandwich with tofu and seasonal slaw on a baguette, served with a pickle spear and potato salad. The tofu was firm and slightly crispy, the slaw fresh and full of flavor, and the baguette soaked up the sandwich's delicious sauces without becoming soggy or mushy. I prefer a mustard-based potato salad, but the traditional one that came with my meal was a-ok. Tangent: I think it's cute that the menu describes the additional side as ""a really good pickle."" Really! Overall, the meal filled me up without leaving me feeling bloated or gross--- perfect lunch portions! I ate every last bite!

2) The staff was AWESOME. It appeared as though the owner and\/or head chef was present, seated towards the side\/back of the restaurant, close to where we were eating. (This might have been a contributing factor to the good service, but whatevs.) I always appreciate when owners\/chefs are visibly present in the restaurant. To me, it speaks volumes and shows they actually care about their patrons, the food, and the community. Thanks for that!

3) The restaurant looked TERRIFIC. It was exceptionally clean and also well decorated. I loved the variety of high tables and regular tables, make it perfect for groups, a business lunch, or a romantic meal. Side note: I went on a Friday at about 1:00 pm, and although I didn't have to wait for a table, the place was BUSY. I wouldn't be surprised if there are normally wait times, so plan ahead.

I ordered the free-range chicken sandwich with mozzarella, greens, tomatoes, and pesto. You would think this is kind of a healthier choice right? I took one bite and it tastes like POPCORN! I was weirded out...haha. I kept trying to figure out why it tasted like popcorn and then I realized how much butter they put on the bread. It's like they smothered it with layers of butter while toasting it. All I tasted was butter. So this is definitely not a healthy place. Everything is covered in oil, butter, sauce, etc. You get one pickle spear with the dish and even the pickle was not good. I personally believe they should change the brand they buy (again, this is all based off of personal taste. I'm sure other people love it. Why else would everyone rate it so well). You get one side with the sandwich and I got the tomato soup. Once again, nothing out of this world. Oh and maybe they should use a smaller cup to put it in so that the bowl does not look so empty since it's just a side (presentation is important!). 

As far as service...mediocre. The girl was helpful and answered my questions but she doesn't seem happy to be at work. Maybe she was having a bad day. When we finished with our meal, they just dropped off the check without offering us dessert or coffee.

I'm happy to see a downtown restaurant getting on board with clean eating and offering free range chicken meal options.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the place opened on Monday, and just four days later, it was super busy during the lunch hour. 

It's definitely a hip, trendy lunch spot. The restaurant isn't very big but has several different tables to eat at, plus a counter and a rectangular bistro table (I think called the community table or something like that). 

I had the free range mozzarella sandwich with potato salad and a pickle.  Overall, it was good but I thought my chicken was lacking just a little bit of flavor so I added some salt and pepper to it.  The potato salad was really good, not too mushy or mayonnaisey.  My lunch mates both had the chicken caesar (also free range), which they said was delicious.  One friend said that the dressing was fresh and tasted like it was made from scratch. 

The one downside was the noise level inside the restaurant.  Once the restaurant filled up, it became really loud and we had to talk loud (and basically shout) to hear one another.  I wouldn't recommend more than four people to a table during the usual lunch hour.

Usually the wait for this place is pretty long & people are hanging out outside waiting to be called in. Fortunately, today the odds were on our favor! No wait to be seated! 

We first had ordered strawberry cinnamon biscuits which were to die for! They were biscuits swimming in this strawberry jam sauce. It wasn't too sweet but decently sweet enough. 

I had ordered the Shrimp & Grits! Which is, hands down, the BEST, grits I ever had. Usually restaurants over cook or under cook grits but this place makes it to perfection. It had picco di gallo on top which added a Little kick in your mouth. The bacon on the bottom just added the necessary flavors to this dish. I finished the whole thing! & could've licked the bowl but controlled myself.

I found street parking easily on 7th ($1 \/ hour, max 2 hours).  There are pay stations everywhere conveniently.  I had a party of 6, so I had to wait to be seated until entire party was present.  I was on a time crunch though, so when the rest of the party was still parking, the manager let me be seated first.  We were able to get a table right away and put in our orders before it got too late.  On a Saturday afternoon, I thought it was still busy.  Some parties had a short 10-15 minute wait.  This restaurant reminded me of Cheeky's in Palm Springs - very good brunch place with outdoor seating.

Food was really good.  As I was perusing the menu, I wanted to order everything!  I couldn't decide what to get because they all sounded really good.  My shrimp and grits had plenty of shrimp ($13).  I did not feel ripped off, and there were 2 big pieces of bacon in it!  The portion was enough to share with 2 people.  The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was perfect ($8). The 4 biscuits were not dry at all, and the compote was not too sweet.  They looked so cute - disc-shaped.  My friends who had Huevos Montulenos $12, Chicken Fried Steak $14, and the eggs benedict $13 thought their dishes turned out really well, too.  Everything pretty much had huge serving sizes.  I love that!  Next time I'll probably try the arugula salad or the pancakes..mm..

I really like the service here.  Everyone is so friendly and NOT stuck up, which is something I'm used to with a popular hipster cafe\/restaurant.

     The ambience of Eat is actually quite enjoyable. Even though the restaurant is usually jam packed, the restaurant is pretty quiet, so you can enjoy your meal and the people you are (most likely) sharing it with. 
     I ordered the truffled egg sandwich. It took a while until I got my food, but it was worth it. The sandwich was the perfect combination of creamy avocado, fluffy scrambled eggs, earthy mushrooms, and pungent scallions. The only complaint I have about the sandwich is about the bread. It was way too soft so my sandwich fell apart when I held it. I had to eat it with a fork and knife (the hipster way to eat sandwiches!)

- huevos motulenos: it was such an interesting mix of flavors that i was surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did. the two different salsas with the eggs, beans, bananas, peas & feta - it was almost like a breakfast salad (minus the greens haha). the potatoes that come as a side were amazing, sprinkled with chives and perfectly crisp exteriors.

I'm bumping up my review of eat to a fiver after my breakfast yesterday morning.

I entered eat around 10 AM hungry for some breakfast action not knowing exactly what I would get. I've been here once before for breakfast and had the truffled egg sandwich (delicious!), but this time I went with the Chilaquiles Scrambled Eggs, What the... this is what breakfast is made of my friends. Everything about this meal from the ingredients, to the execution, to the presentation was perfect. I was so satisifed with this meal I was thinking about the great review I was going to give it while I was eating it. Not to mention, I cleaned my plate. 

This delicious meal is scrambled eggs, turken, jalapeno mango sausage, 
corn tortilla chips, cheddar, red & green new mexican chili. The mango sausage is the star that pulls everything together because it has an amazingly sweet, savory, and spicy taste to it that plays on your taste-buds.

I've been in here when there were a few more people (as in the place was packed) and the loudness leaves a bit to be desired for ambiance, but my breakfast was calm with minimal noise even though there were quite a few patrons (and myself) sitting at the bar.

What also gets to my heart is the fact that they use locally grown produce here from Caliente, NV. I love it. We need to get back to that idea of using what is near us instead of stuff that is miles and miles away.

Overall, love eat. I will go back to eat here again and again.",4,2,3

From what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.

As the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....

And as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...

We're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...

We were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!

And we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!

Well, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!

I came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!

I relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy\/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...

By our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.

We also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....

And as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!

The straw mushrooms were a delicious surprise that my taste buds didn't expect. From now on, if I try to cook with eggs at home the way I ate at EAT, I will use Asian sauteed straw mushrooms the way the chef did, because the taste was a brilliant dim sum likeness in flavor. The service was great, not only friendly, but helpful, because my son wanted a pancake, and the server helped him go through the menu to find the right pancake. Than to add to my boy's surprise, our server brought him his own individually sealed maple syrup jar, which thrilled him. Not just a bottle of maple set on the table like hot sauce or ketchup, each child gets a little individual glass jar of sealed maple syrup with their pancakes. Huevos Motulenos was eggs in a combined peppered green sauce Mexican chili. Motulenos breakfast dishes originated in the town of Motul in the Yucatán. Again more surprises, the spicy eggs had sauted bananas on corn tortilla​. ​Perfect combination! Sweet fruit, bananas, but not too sweet, reminded me of dishes in Harlem, New York City with the addition of the bananas combined with peppers, eggs yolks, whites, and fresh stewed beans. There was a line of people outside when we arrived and leave the lobby. The place was packed. We heard stories of food networks and cooking channels coming to Las Vegas to visit the EAT restaurant Anthony Bourdain eats breakfast at when he visits Las Vegas. I guess he hosted a CNN TV special where he promoted EAT as the place to go in the Entertainment Capital of the World. People used to go to Hash House a Go Go, but now all the talk about the globe is the restaurant EAT if you visit Las Vegas. Afterwards, my family and I went to the most famous donut stand in town, which is directly across the street, Donut Bar. Their donuts are collecting awards all over the nation. All the kids had fun at the Downtown Container Park which is also directly across the street from EAT. Visit Kappa Toys with this kids. Extraordinary collection of specialty toys. This restaurant EAT is brightening up the whole neighborhood landscape with all the attention the chef is bringing to the corner with his fine cuisine.",0,0,0

I ordered the DWBLTA with chips and an iced tea. Friend ordered . . . oh yeah! Breakfast! Some breakfast sandwich that he had several things removed from, and he was so excited to be able to order breakfast. I'm happiest when my friends are happy. 

Server was back in a flash with our drinks. It was tropical passion tea with an orange slice and mint sprig it in it - delish! 

In the blink of an eye - server was back with our lunch! YAY for fast service on the lunch hour! 

The DWBLTA was the best I've had. Fresh absolutely everything, with lots of avocado (not one skinny slice like some places!), a schmear of - I think Russian Dressing? And the bacon was amazing. YUM. I had the chips as the side, and they were awesome! I never clean my plate, and I cleaned my plate. My friend was amazed.

Friend was sure they were gonna mess up his breakfast sandwich with his ""hold this and that"" business - they did not. It was perfect, and he said delicious. 

Server was quick with our check and cashing us out. In fact? It was 12:35 and we were done, and able to just chat! FUN!

My wife saw it featured in Sunset magazine. So when we were looking for a decent breakfast option before leaving Vegas to head home, we thought we would give it a try.

It is in a small, nondescript location a bit off the strip. Parking can clearly be a challenge but it is available especially if you don't mind walking for a bit. There are a few metered spots right in front. Around the corner, you can park on the street for free. And there is a parking garage a block or two to the west, right on the strip. I do not know whether there was a fee for the garage.

The restaurant is small and will get busy early. Most of the tables are intended for parties of 2-4. Plan to wait a while for a table especially if you have a large group. But it is well worth your time.

We decided to keep it simple for the first time around. Both my wife and I had the pancakes with chicken apple sausage. As I said before, these were awesome! The pancakes are huge. You may want to check them out before ordering, just to see if you need to split or try a short stack. We had heard a lot about the beignets and were looking forward to trying them. Unfortunately, the restaurant was out of them. I do not know if this is a common occurrence, but it is worth noting if you have your heart set on these. For us, we just have another reason to visit.

Unfortunately, this eatery wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  The food is okay, but nothing special.

Two of us had shrimp and grits... It was okay, but didn't wow us.  There was a nice quantity of shrimp in the serving.  Another person ordered the egg truffle sandwich.  It was a large sandwich.  She said it was good but not something she'd go out of her way for.  

The potatoes that come with the egg truffle sandwich had an odd taste, almost like they were tossed in rancid oil first.  My friend has a complicated palate and said perhaps they were seasoned with truffle oil...  I don't know but I would not order them.  

We ordered regular coffee and it had an unusual flavor as well.

The chicken fried steak was not really crispy at all, and even if it had been, the flavor was decent but overall nothing special.  The sandwich did have a satisfyingly truffle-y fragrance, but other than that it was a solid egg sandwich.  A little dry but good.  Some sort of sauce would have set it off.  The potatoes were really nothing special.  The pancakes were probably the highlight....there was just *something* that made them really delicious.  Have you ever had malasadas in Hawaii????  The uniqueness of the batter tasted a lot like those warm, melt-in-your-mouth malasadas.  Yum.  

Pretty long line, luckily the wait was only 20 min.  Anything longer, in my opinion, would not really be worth it.   And ambiance was SUPER loud.  Like felt like a nightclub loud.  There are so many places in Vegas, and glad we tried this one, but not itching to come back.",0,1,0

Unfortunately, when we finally got our table, our server wasn't as helpful. He had zero sense of urgency and didn't do a good job of remembering our order. A second and a half after we ordered, another employee came back to double check our drink order, which was all wrong. Our food, which was good, was unceremoniously slammed down on the table moments later. I ordered the huevos motulenos and they were great, but not good enough to make up for the bad service. We kept having to ask for things like ketchup, even though there were potatoes on both of our plates. My friend had to ask for a coffee refill twice. These seem like basics the average IHOP waitress can do. Why can't downtown's ""hippest"" breakfast place do the same?

What ultimately convinced me not to go back was when the check was delivered. A little note from management was included telling patrons that Eat does NOT split checks because they're so ""busy."" I just don't think that's good customer service, and I think it's a lie. They probably don't want to pay two credit card fees per check when they can pay one. Eat, this is Las Vegas.

The location didn't bother me as it seemed to bother other reviewers. You have to pay for parking which is inconvenient if you don't have change, but I was willing to do that if the food was good. Sadly, it wasn't.

First of all our server was very aggressive. He put his hand on the back of my chair and leaned in close to my personal space. He creeped me out. I appreciate friendliness but I don't appreciate you getting really close to me. My husband noticed it right away too.

We had coffee while waiting for our order. It wasn't horrible or anything- I've had much worse- but it tasted over extracted, like they were skimping on the amount of coffee used to brew it. At $3 a cup (yep, $6 in total for two mugs of coffee), it should taste better than that.

My husband ordered shrimp & grits and he loved it. He ordered it because that's the dish he heard others raving about.

I ordered the eggs benedict and holy moly, the sauce was SOUR! Not a good kind of sour either. The bacon was also limp and chewy. Yes, it was turkey bacon, which I eat at home all the time, but it didn't even taste like it was cooked. It was really gross.

The serving size was small, but that wouldn't have bothered me if the food actually tasted good. I don't like stuffing myself with huge portions at breakfast, but it's hard to not feel ripped off when you paid $13 for english muffins with limp bacon and sour hollandaise sauce.

The ambience was cool and hipster-ish. I think it's cool that they let their waiters have tattoos and dyed hair, but that doesn't make the food taste better or the waiter less creepy. Also the music was far too loud, my husband and I could barely have a conversation.

Final verdict: waste of money for now. The place is new, maybe they'll work the kinks out. If they changed a few things this place could be great but I'm not returning for now.",0,1,0

It's a local spot that has a great sense of community with emphasis on all things comfort. All ingredients are responsibly sourced with leafy greens locally sourced. The space comes together with different elements from the green colored walls, to the exposed brick with the mixture of mismatched paintings and decor. Bringing in a bright and relaxed atmosphere, great breakfast brunch vibe that's rumored to push out pretty damn good comfort food. 

We all ended up getting sandwiches which were all served on their ciabatta bun, let's just rave over how perfect this bread was. Crisp outer layer with the soft spongy interior that soaks up all the juices and sauces that are layered on. Talk about levels of flavour. Who knew the bun that a sandwich is served on could elevate the meal so much more. 

Shrimp Po'Boy - ($14) - Juicy sautéed shrimp topped with spicy napa slaw and cilantro finished with a sriracha mayo. This was a darn good sandwich. Spicy mayo and the spicy slaw gave a really good kick in flavour and there was a hefty amount of shrimp stuffed in between. Recommend 100%

Roast Beef - ($14) - The flawless layers of roast beef with another flawless layer of arugula, presentation alone was captivating. Served with mayo with sprinkles of pickled red onions, this was a heavy sandwich compared to the shrimp but flavours were awesome and also really satisfying.  

Free Range Chicken - ($12) One of the more basic sandwiches with the added addition of their pesto mayo; which was probably the ingredient that stood out the most. Added with that ciabatta bun and boy, this basic juicy chicken sandwich just leveled up to a whole new experience.

All of the sandwich choices had a slice of pickle and the added option of choosing between chip, soup,salad or potato salad. I opted for chips and the other two got the potato salad. My chips were yummy, but the potato salad wasn't a crowd pleaser for us. Not creamy enough to our liking I suppose. 

Service wasn't spectacular. Had to ask our server twice for a water refill, huffed when we wanted to clarify the brunch menu items and all in all didn't seem pleased that she had to serve us. she also didn't remember to add our orange juice to the bill, which made up for the shoddy service.",0,1,0

It's a solid place for breakfast foods\/brunch with a twist. Everything I've ever had at Eat has been great, and I look forward to trying new things from them. 

The restaurant itself is decently sized, but seeing the amount of foot traffic this place gets, it's clear they should consider relocating to a larger location in downtown. The only negative about Eat is that the wait can be eternal if you go during lunch time. We came at around 10:30 am on a weekday and it was a 25-30 wait. I've been when the wait was 40-45 min, so try to come at a slower time if you want to be seating within 10 min.

We got the Shrimp Po Boy, Shrimp and Grits, and the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. The shrimp po boy was good, but the shrimp to vegetable ratio was very skewed towards the vegetables. There was barely any shrimps in the sandwich. 

The shrimp and grits were very good, and when the egg's yolk breaks into the grits, it's rich and heavenly. The pico on top gives it a nice fresh flavor and gives it some texture.

One of the best things they had there was the OJ. It's fresh squeezed and sweet, and it's everything you could want in a nice OJ. The only downside was that it was $6. Kind of pricey, but if you're feeling zesty, it's a good option.

Overall, the food is good. The wait sucks. Get the shrimp and grits or the grilled cheese. Don't forget the OJ.",3,3,1

We had heard it was a local favorite and the line outside proved that what we were about to experience was good. 

The hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait so I asked her if I could have a glass of water. We waited outside and decided to check out the cool container park next door while we waited. When we got back the hostess let us know that she had gotten me my water and I wasn't there! I felt like a jerk but she was very nice about it and didn't make me feel bad about it at all. I appreciate that she went out of her way to get the water for me because at the time 5 other people were barking in her face at the same time. I wish I could bump up the review to 5 stars just because she was so cool about it, but this review has to be about the food.

That isn't to say the food isn't great. We started off with the cinnamon biscuits covered in a strawberry compote and powdered sugar. Eat that! Its fantastic. Your waistline will complain at first but just tell it to hush up because its worth it...

For brunch I had the truffled egg sandwich and my gf had the huevos motulenos. Both were really good. The banana in the huevos motulenos was a little weird at first but after a couple bites the sweetness of the banana balanced the dish well. My egg sandwich was good but kinda plain. It was basically egg, bacon, and mushroom for most of it which isn't a bad thing. I was thinking the whole time eating it that it could use some salt but it wasn't until I got to the end of the sandwich that I got a taste of the feta. That was the tang that really made the sandwich. I guess someone just forgot to put it throughout because that was certainly how the chef intended it to taste.

Pro-tip: The coffee is awesome, nutty, and smooth
Super pro-tip for out of towners: The street parking on 7th street is free on sundays yet you will probably not see the one sign that tells you that and pay by accident.

I also fantasize about their cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote.

The few things that I don't like, is that we have never had a friendly waiter\/waitress.

I also have to warn you that their veggie burger is terrible! So the next time I went I ordered another dish without the bacon and the waitress said ""we are too busy right now to make any substitutions"" uhmm I wasn't making a substitution, I just said no bacon.... Anyway!

Shrimp and grits - grits had great texture. A good amount of shrimp but tasted frozen.

Coffee - nothing special 

Passion Fruit Iced Tea - refreshing

Here comes the horrible service. These are facts, not opinions.

We were seated by a nice hostess and given our drinks immediately. Our server whom I will not name for his safety didn't bother to greet us or introduce himself. After we ordered and was well into our meal, not once did he come up to us to ask ""how we were doing?"" ""How's the food?"" Or refilled our water cups. However, he did all those three service favors for others around us. I politely asked for syrup from him and he gave me a blank face. Came back and put the syrup in front of me with no word. 

After we were finished with our meals and already annoyed, a busser comes to our table and asks (in a awkward tone) ""are you done?"". He stacked our plates quickly and never said a word further. Not to mention we thanked him for cleaning our table. 

When I asked our waiter for the check, he came back with it and didn't say a single word. I paid and left him a tip because I understand servers make their money off tips. I left him a personal note to let him know our experience at Eat.

Huevos Motulenos ($12) Two eggs over easy on top of red & green New Mexican chili, black beans, peas, feta, sauteed bananas, all on a corn tortilla w\/ a side of chive potatoes.  I 86'ed the feta due to an allergy.  The portion is huge!  All of these ingredients seemed like such a bizarre combination that I had to try it.  When you cut into the egg and it runs over the beans, chili, and banana, the flavor profile is amazing.  The sweetness of the banana is so unexpected when mixed with all the savory flavors.  Truly a unique dish that I did not want to stop enjoying.  The potatoes were also really good, but largely forsaken in lieu of the main dish.

Downtown Eggs Benedict ($13) This is an off menu item, but I gather from what I've heard that it's available every weekend even though it's not listed.  This benedict is made up of turkey bacon, sauteed spinach, a slice of tomato, poached egg covered in hollandaise, all stacked on a wheat English muffin.  This may be one of the best bennies ever we've ever tried.  The hollandaise was definitely at the top of the list.  This dish was accompanied by a couple strawberries and the same fantastic breakfast potatoes.

Single pancake ($3)  I am always on the lookout for the perfect pancake. While Du-Par's definitely wins this contest hands down, the pancake at eat. was very good and almost dessert like because it was dusted with confectioners sugar.  Fluffy with slightly crispy edges, this pancake would make my top 10 list.  Since it was already covered in sugar, we didn't crack open the little glass jar of maple syrup.",6,3,4

Sat at the counter and ordered the huevos motulenos.  They tasted fabulous (lots of flavor going on here!) and the presentation was perfect.  The manager DID make the chef re-plate my food and made sure I saw him do it, which was kind of pretentious in retrospect.

We didn't have to wait as the hostess happily seated us near the kitchen (which by the way is open, so that was fun). We ordered drinks and then placed our order with a friendly waiter. I chose the ""killer"" grilled cheese with tomato soup and my boyfriend had the BLT with avocado. They both came out of the kitchen in record time... we were not expecting them to be so quick, especially with a packed house! Both dishes were amazing. The bread is to die for! It really made the sandwiches. I loved both dishes (had to sample) but I will say the BLT may have been the winner. It was also served with homemade chips that were especially good.

The food?  Ordered corned beef hash with 2 poached eggs..$14.  Large orange juice, pasteurized, that one can buy gallon for $2, costs $6\/glass.

There is a waiting room inside with a couple of chairs and some people were waiting outside. It was a very windy cold day so we decided to wait inside. 

I decided to go with their special of the day. It was egg Benedict. It was two beautiful poached egg with spinach and tomatoes with sauce. I thought the tomatoes and the sauce didn't go too well together. The potatoes was okay. 

I also ordered the cinnamon biscuits. This comes with the warm strawberry compote. I only enjoyed the sauce. We didn't even finish this dish. 

However, my friend ordered the corned beef hash. This dish was good and tasted like chinese sausages.

This place was amazing!  We started with some of their fresh baked berry biscuits which were freaking unbelievable. We're talking hot, fresh baked biscuits topped with fresh fruit and jam. Simply amazing. 

For our mains, I had the chicken breast sandwich with mozzarella and a side of bacon on a ciabatta bun while my wife had the eggs benedict. Both dishes were awesome.  The chicken sandwich was cooked perfectly, and the bacon, mozzarella, and greens complemented each other perfectly.  The sandwich is topped with an amazing pesto mayo and the entire things rests on a delicious, toasted ciabatta bun.  I had the freshly made potato chips as a side and they were fantastic.  There were tons of them too. 

My wife's eggs benedict was easily one the best she's had, with perfectly cooked eggs and fabulous hollandaise sauce.  The dish came with delicious potatoes, which were perfectly prepared. I also have to comment on the coffee, which was outstanding.  Rich and delicious and perfectly brewed. Absolutely fabulous coffee. 

Service was friendly and impeccable.  We were greeted promptly by the chef\/owner who offered us a pick of the available tables (we popped in an hour from closing and the place was nearly packed).  Orders for drinks and biscuits and then our food were promptly taken and served, with the food coming out just as we finished off those amazing biscuits.

I came here for breakfast and ordered the 2 egg breakfast which comes with bacon, potatoes, and your choice of bread. My friend decided on the golden brown pancakes.

While waiting for our food, the waiter puts down a side plate of packets of butter and 2 miniature containers of syrup. My friend and I decided to ask the owner about her choice of serving pre packaged butter and syrup. She told us it was more sanitary, they could tell how much syrup each customer used, and was more cost effective. Her answer was satisfactory until I really thought about it and my side of English muffins came out. The butter packet was on top of the English muffin and it was barely toasted and soggy. I thought to myself how many times those butter packets have been handled and how unsanitary it was sitting on top of my English muffin.

I have been twice, and both times there was wait. It didn't take more than 15 minutes for us to be seated. The real wait takes place after you're seated. There seems to be a good amount of servers floating around, but the service isn't all that great.

The first time I went, we had the berry biscuits as an appetizer and I order the chilaquiles. The berry biscuits are great. The biscuits are a tad bit dense, but the compote is divine. The chilaquiles were awful. Besides the chips and eggs, the dish was far from what I was expecting. There was some sort of mango concoction that was not appealing to my palate. Just awful!

My next time around I order the pancakes. If you want good plain pancakes, look no further. The pancakes are fluffy and well-seasoned - can you say a pancake is well-seasoned? Anyway, these bad boys don't even need syrup! I also got a side of cheese grits as recommended by the waiter. They were disgusting. Not enough cheese and the were extremely clumpy.

Shrimp and grits!
- plain grits (not cheesy or flavorful on it's own) in a light broth that tasted slightly like the sauteed shrimp. Eggs were nice and runny just how I like. the shrimp was the star of the dish.  it was a little garlicky, a little smokey, and quite juicy.  however it only came with 6 pieces.

I'd read about it online and my spouse had seen something about Bourdain having been here.  We are almost always looking for breakfasty brunchy things around 11am-1pm and especially when in Las Vegas.  We called on a Monday and no one answered.  Tuesday we just happened to be in the area on our way to some fair, single deck blackjack at the El Cortez and there it was... eat!

Not sure how my spouse got the curse, but everywhere she goes she\/we get seated immediately next to the restroom door, service station or whatever worst table they have.  No different here.  They seated us next to some rolling trays of syrup in little jars right where the servers buzz by on their way out of the kitchen.  We've stopped asking why.  This time we just accepted it.  

One of my favorite all time dishes is Shrimp and Grits so that jumped out at me from the menu.  Of course, it's a breakfast version with bacon slices, over easy eggs and sauce right on top.  It was very tasty and I can honestly say I've never had bacon and shrimp in my mouth at the same time.  That was a little different.  Visually this dish wasn't that appealing, but considering the consistency of grits...  The grits were a bit saucy and considering the fact that they were supporting so much, it might make sense to cook them up a little firmer.in this dish.  It got very messy once a yoke was cut open with my fork, but hey, I ate every bite!  

Probably didn't need to but it felt like toast was needed so I ordered a side of wheat.  The slices are very thick and not toasted but grilled.  Spouse didn't eat hers.  She got the corned beef has breakfast.  Said it was delicious!  

Overall the place a a trendy, young professional hang out with lots of young techie types eating together, talking business and checking their devices.  The staff was accommodating although they were a bit rushed and didn't have time to understand that the spouse wanted nothing on her grits because she like butter and sugar on them - ugh! - so they brought hers with chives on top even though all she asked for was extra butter.

We went on a Saturday morning and it was quite pack, which was okay since I had time to read yelp reviews while we were waiting. I was getting really excited to try their food here and especially when I read that they had beignets!

....We got seated and I overheard a waitress saying that they did NOT have beignets due to the fact that the cold weather was not letting the beignets rise properly. ( I was so so disappointed!)  But it was okay, I was still really excited to eat their food!

What we ordered:
Country Fried Steak (2.5): Unfortunately, I only took a few bites of this, so I cannot review it the best that I can.  However, the chicken fried steak was incredibly dry and I felt like it needed more flavor in it.  The potatoes were good though. 

Shrimp & Grits (3): I, also took only a few bites of this as well because I was also pretty disappointed how it tasted like. Maybe because i didn't like the fact that my bacon was soaked with grits.  But the shrimp tasted delicious and I like how it almost seemed like it was a soup, but it wasn't.  I didn't end up finishing it, Brad T. though finished it for me.

Pancake (5): BEST PANCAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED! I absolutely loved it! I love how the top its crispy golden brown. Once you taken a bite of it, oh man! it its absolutely incredible! I highly recommend anyone to order their pancakes!


Service (2): The service was upsetting to say the least.  I understand that they are busy, but at least just come back to our table at least one time. After our server took our order he never ever came back to check up on us.  For instance, I forgot to ask for maple syrup with my pancakes, so I couldn't eat it until I had to wait for a server to look straight at me so I can wave at them. Overall, the service was just really upsetting.  The only time he came back was to give us our check.

The food was OK, but not really worth the drive and parking to downtown. And I LOVE a good breakfast place.   My friend had the egg truffle sandwich, which she said was pretty good, and I had bacon and eggs, which were decent (but insanely greasy).  The beignets that arrived before the meal were also good--but also incredibly greasy.  At around noon, the crowd picked up and it was very busy.  

The kicker for Eat, and the reason I won't be returning, is that upon receiving our credit cards back from the bill, we noticed a photocopied note that had been highlighted, which (very condescendingly) stated that split checks during ""slammed"" times was not appreciated.  Now, had we been TOLD that by the waitress prior to running our check, we would not have split it (down the middle, not by item, mind you).  After an inordinate amount of time between the end of our meal, the dropping of the check, and the waiting for our credit cards back, we were informed by one of the wait staff that Eat only has one credit card machine.  Seriously?  With all the free card runners (Square, etc...) out there, an establishment is going to blame the customer for the slow down of running two cards? And again, it was not busy when we entered, and had the bill been dropped in a timely manner, we could have been on our way, leaving behind us a free table for the crowd.  So there you have it.

First when we got there our server just kept trying to up sell us. Try once but then read your customers and stop. We sat down and she asked us if we wanted beverages and both of us just said water, and she was like ""no coffee, juice?"" No just water, she said okay and then i cant remember if she asked us if we wanted sparkling water or bottle water, so again we both said ""no just regular water with some ice please."" That kind of irritated us. 

Then my friend had read on yelp that the chilaquiles were better if you asked to have the egg fried instead of scrambled. While we were looking at the menu, my friend kept reminding me to have her egg fried. The server came back and asked us if we wanted to order- i was still looking so we said we needed a minute. And she again was like ""oh well can i start you with something biegnets maybe, our biegnets are really good."" We were going to split biegnets so we just ordered them but after being pushed about the drinks the server was just kind of irritating us. 

The biegnets- huge disappointment. I know there are different schools of thought on who likes what type of biegnets- I personally like light fluffy biegnets. These ones were the doughy thick biegnets- which the main downfall is the dough soaks up a lot of oil. As soon as we picked up the biegnets the oils saturated everything, my fingers, it was half and inch into the biegnets, I used napkins to soak up the excess oil- this is just a huge turn off. Of the six we only ate two. Which is sad because had they been good we would have been fighting over them and probably ordered seconds.

The server comes back and we place our breakfast order- my friend asks for the chilaquiles but wanted to change the egg to a fried egg. The server responded with ""oh well thats our signature dish so its really designed to be eaten the way we have it on the menu.""- omg I so wanted to say ""well yelp is designed to help customers improve their experience at a restaurant."" The server would not change the eggs, my friend just got frustrated and ordered shrimp and grits- which the server then said, ""yeah maybe youll like that better."". For me I just ordered one pancake- mainly because the biegnet kind of ruined things for me. The server looked at me and was like ""one pancake? are you sure you can get a short stack of two for $6.00 our pancakes are the best ever you might want to do that."" Again i can read the menu I took time to look over the options, i saw there was a short stack and no i would just like ONE pancake thanks. After repeating myself she said ""do you want to add eggs, or bacon or sausage?"" Again no, just the pancake.

When the shrimp and grits came I could just tell my friend was going to be disappointed- the bacon was not crispy it actually looked under cooked, where the fat on the bacon is still white and flabby. The grits looked okay. I could not try it because im allergic to shrimp- but then again i dont think I would have wanted too. After having grits from Lola though, I knew those grits at Eat could not compare. I asked my friend how did these grits rank compared to Lolas. And she replied ""Lolas is a 10 and these are a ZERO."" bummer. 

My pancake was good. Its served really cute with a little personal jar of syrup. I wouldn't say its the best pancake ever- i still think my favorite pancakes are at Babystacks. It is a good pancake though.

Then our bill- our server mysteriously disappeared and no other servers seemed to want to help us out so we waited a bit- like a while for our server to reappear. She brought us our check and we placed two cards in it. When we got our check back there was a note inside that said ""During busy times we request you do not split checks. Thanks"" That's kind of what did it for me. I was thinking well you know what we request that you get competent servers then. Most of us in Vegas have worked at one time or another in the food industry at busier places then Eat and have had to split checks- learn your trade and multitask. 

So I wouldnt go here again- Id rather go to Babystacks any day.",2,0,1

Atmosphere: at 7th and Carson, the location may turn some off or make it tough to find, but it's really not too far off the beaten path.  Although you may be pretty close to the other tables, the walls are all window so it gives a more open appearance.  The tables may be close for comfort for some, but I'm fine with it.   BONUS: Sunday brunch had an excellent jazz band.  I suspect it may be a bit loud if right next to them, but from the back it was fine.

Food: This is a modern southern style of food.  I've been for breakfast twice and brunch. I work far away so I can't comment on lunch.  We've had the Beignets: Maybe a bit doughy, but the jams and mascarpone are great.  Their verson of benedict was nice.  My favourite is the oft mentioned Shrimp and Grits.  The shrimp is delicate and mixes surprisigly well with the butter\/bacon egg combo.    In an entire bit of constructive criticism, I do hope that the menu changes a little bit for the seasons, ans the somewhat heavier food served here may not be too appetizing in the summer.

I have to mention the pancakes,, not a fan of pancakes, but these were excellent.  Just enough crisp without burn, no doughiness and tasty enough without the syrup.

Service: Everyone s prety positive. You can see there is some occasionall hecticness when the kitchen gets slammed, but doesn't generally show.  One can tell a good camarederie from the staff.  I'm not personally a fan of service by committee so there are occasional miscommunications, but they are very well staffed so generally you are taken care of.

Bravo, definitely a nice treat when I get to stay in and hang around my downtown for breakfast.  Looking forward to lunch sometime.",2,0,2

The shrimp and grits were worth fighting over.  Strips of bacon covered on creamy grits, egg over easy, shrimp cooked to perfection with a pico de gallo type sauce over it.   Our server suggested a side of sourdough to dip in the grits which was a great suggestion.

You're almost always going to have to wait.
Some of the food is awesome. Some of it is not. 

Here are some favs--

Grilled Cheese w\/ kickass tomato soup
Chicken Fried Steak
2 Eggs any Style - especially with their sourdough. It's amazing. 
Pancakes

The other food we've tried is very...okayish. Especially the shrimp and grits. The grits have little to no flavor. And they're extremely runny. I prefer the grits to be thick, creamy and buttery. That's usually the awesome part about shrimp and grits. Maybe it's just me. 

And my biggest complaint here: the service. Not that it's slow. It's just plain fucking weird. From the hostess to the servers. They're so nonchalant, and it's bizzare. The hostess does not greet you when you come in, and they don't tell you ""good bye"" or ""thank you"" when you leave. And the servers...one of the guys, we've had twice. He barely even talks to you. He comes up and gives you this look like, ""Well? What do you want?"" 
He's even stuck his head in between ours to ask if our food was okay...and it was literally inches from my face. Who the fuck does that?! Also, we put our card down to pay because he never checked on us...he looked at it, pointed at it, and then looked at my fiance. My fiance responded, ""Could you please close us out?"" Still, no response. He took the card, knodded and walked off. Please tell me that's NOT weird or unprofessional. No question mark needed. It's rhetorical. 

The best thing about this trip: a lady serving us drinks (which she happened to be super nice and helpful) told me about the cold brew they had. I ordered it and it was amazing. 

I'm sorry, but when this seems to be a regular occurance here, I'd rather take my business elsewhere going foward.

Really nice looking place - modern\/industrial look.  Solid breakfast menu with American and Mexican items - everything was around the $8 - $12 range.  My brother got the chicken friend steak and I ordered the chilaquiles. The food came out quick and it was excellent.

Now, I have to start off with the fact that if you're looking for traditional chilaquiles you're going to be disappointing, luckily the menu was pretty clear what I'd be getting so I knew what to expect.  A few things that you could call non-traditional -  they used cheddar cheese (not cotija or fresca), they poured the salsa on the chips, the chips aren't cooked in the salsa, and finally they topped it off with a big old turkey sausage! 

So you're probably thinking why I'd give 4 stars to this abomination???  Because it was delicious and it filled me up - what more can you ask for?  The chips were good and held up on their own, even without the salsa.  The salsa was delicious!  Spicy but not too hot - just enough to help with the mild hangover.  The eggs were nice and fluffy and they served a good amount of them.  The Sausage was a little on the sweet side, but still really good.

I tried a little bit of my brothers chicken fried steak.  The breading was nice and thick and tasted amazing.  The steak was a really thick cut - none of that thin milanesa type steak.  The home fries were top notch - nice and crispy on the outside and light on the inside.

Oh & the coffee was excellent as well.

So what was the boner move?  They brought the check about 5 minutes after the food hit the table - I hate that...  I don't care if they say ""no rush"" I still hate it.  Other then that the service was good, they checked on us a couple of times, coffee cup never went empty.

After all the hype, rave reviews and etc I guess my expectations were perhaps too high. 

The deviled eggs are fabulous, but the positive review ends there. 

Went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was only 5 min. I saw online that the Benedict, truffled eggs and cinnamon biscuits are a must-try. I got the Benedict, my friend ordered the chicken fried steak. I added on the deviled eggs after seeing them go by ( there's 4 pieces). 

My Benedict was fair, the hollandaise tasted metallic in flavor, the English muffin was mushy, tomatoes were mushy, with the spinach and egg it as just a lot of much with a weird metallic flavor. I added a ton of salt and pepper as the overall dish was under seasoned. 

The pancakes looked amazing, the chicken fried steak gave my friend diarrhea. Sorry tmi. 

The main waiter seems tired and not very engaging. The hostess and cocktail waitress (although they don't serve alcohol) were very friendly, nice, chatty and fun. 

Highlight: the deviled eggs were deep fried, crispy, topped with a spicy tobasco sauce and bacon. Sooooo good! 

This hipster joint with a staff wearing all black with their messy hair with abundance of tattoos showing is more of a place to say you went to than a place with good, delicious and amazing service. I honestly wouldn't go back.",0,0,0

I ordered the corned beef hash with cheese and avocados. My wife had the truffled egg sandwich. 
This was arguably one of the best corn beef hashes I've had in a restaurant. My wife was equally impressed with her truffled egg sandwich. We also ordered a pancake on the side and was very impressed. Gary, our waiter, suggested we eat this while it was still warm, great tip Gary, thanks! The pancake was perfect!

The potatoes served with it was also cooked to perfection and not too mushy or undercooked.

Looking around at the cute interior, I noticed the plant boxes and old bottles, kind of a mid century modern lighting and mismatched chairs. Not feeling very Vegas in aesthetic, which I can very much appreciate, I looked forward to our meal with anticipation that it would be equally appealing. 
Orders placed were the huevos motulenos, delish, both green and red salsa atop over easy eggs, crispy country potatoes joining the plate. My hubby had turkey sausage, country potatoes, scrambled eggs and a few huge pieces of Texas toast. We started off with the flavorfully airy and decadent cinnamon biscuits with a sweet strawberry compote, wow! 
We noticed the other plates brought around looked very good also, the pancakes were ginormous and the chicken fried steak looked good (or so says my hubby, I don't fancy red meat).

Now it's surrounded by a weekend brunch bunch, eagerly awaiting a table into a place simply called eat.  And to that one syllable name, I offer an equal one syllable description that says it all: good.    

After running a 10k in a 80's get-up, a friend, who also ran it but didn't bother dressing up (because she's smart like that) suggested we have breakfast at the nearby eat.  I'm always up for exploring new places since I never get out.  She and her husband were not new to eat and so they suggested that I try the Huevos Motulenos.  I read the ingredients: 2 eggs, red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta, sautéed bananas on corn tortillas.  The discriminating, reserved me would have said, eh, maybe some other time.  But since I was already sticking out like a sore thumb dressed in neon pink leggings, teased hair looking like Madonna circa 1984, I decided, yeah, let's continue this wild new adventure and let me motorboat that dish.  

And motorboat it I did.  I probably would've licked the plate, but I didn't want to look like an animal.  My friends stuck with the traditional pancake short stack and had chicken sausage with it.  They look great, but not nearly as adventurous as the Huevos Motulenos.  

A band started to set up while we were still eating.  They moved perfectly good seating to make room for the live entertainment.  I've nothing against live entertainment, but it limits the seating to an already small cafe.  I'm glad we got there before the rush because when we left, people were outside waiting to get in.  They may have already solved that problem with setting up some patio seating, or at least it appeared that they were going to at the time when I went.  But honestly, it's Vegas, it's hot and getting hotter and it's doubtful anyone wants patio seating.  

To sum it up: if I had to wait, especially if there was a live band playing, I'd probably go some place else.  If there was no wait, I would gladly eat at eat again.",0,0,0

Our waiter, Robert, seemed rushed and wasn't friendly or pleasant.    I ordered the chicken friend steak and asked for the gravy on the side, but when it arrived, my food was covered in gravy.  Before I could ask for a change, the server who brought the food already rushed off.  I relented and ate my food as it came, but was pleasantly surprised.  I normally don't like too much gravy on my food, but the gravy was delicious.  My party also ordered the beignets for the table.  The other reviews on beignets were mixed, so we wanted to try them out for ourselves.  As most reviewers noted, the beignets were dense and not flaky and light like they're suppose to be.  That being said, they still tasted pretty good.

I intend to come back because although it was just an average visit, I see the potential of this place turning into a great local spot.  I think that the staff have to be more friendly and attentive, but otherwise, this is a place that I would still recommend.",0,0,0

We went right when it opened, so we didn't have to deal with any kind of lines. We were sat immediately and we were greeted kindly for our drink requests. Our waiter Gary was very friendly with us and struck conversation with us. He recommended to us some specials and favorites. 

I ended up ordering the Downtown Benedict with a short stack of pancakes. Our food came out within 15 minutes and surprisingly, it was more food than I expected. It definitely looked like it would be a challenge, especially with my pancakes, but needless to say, mission accomplished. Everything in the Downtown Benedict fit so well together from the tomato to the hollandaise sauce. The potatoes that the dish comes with were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, with grilled onions, perfection. The pancakes were cooked well, and the simple fact that it was served with 100% pure maple syrup made it all that much more delicious. I had a great time with the food, staff, and parking even though it was all downtown.

One of my old time favorite breakfast is country fried steak and I was a little iffy getting it here but I had to try it.....and let me tell you, it met my expectations! Eggs was perfectly cooked right and steak was perfect, not rubbery or oily like other breakfast joints. And the potatoes that came with it  was pretty good as well. The only thing that really surprised me was the toast, it's not like a thin bread that they just took out of the package, but a thicker bread slathered perfectly with butter and the bread is fantastic! 

Also had the golden brown pancakes which is WOW! It's 3 pieces of buttermilk w\/ chicken apple sausage on top!! Very creative and the pancake just melts in your mouth w\/ there honey syrup which is finely made at the restaurant! 

Drinks we had apple organic juice...and let me tell you for me being a big foodie and not really a health freak....this made not want to drink just a regular ""Apple juice"".

As far as the good: the decor was really cute and reminded me of some farm-to-table eateries in Denver or Portland, and I really appreciated the variety of menu items, which included healthy options and vegetarian-friendly dishes. 

The execution, however, desperately needed work. My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast on a weekday morning (meaning the place was busy but not slammed), and we ordered water and coffee upon our first interaction with the server. Neither came out until our food arrived. (And it should be noted that my breakfast didn't come out until my boyfriend was almost finished with his plate.) 

As far as food quality, I was again disappointed. I love the idea of beignets, especially with jam and mascarpone, but they were pretty overcooked. My egg white frittata was so wet that I literally had a pool of water on my plate, which made my English muffins soggy and water-logged, and my boyfriend ordered the tofu scramble, which was flavorful but unbelievably greasy.

It seemed busy for a Friday, but we were sat immediately by a very friendly staff member! The atmosphere is cozy and the decor is fun. We started with waters and their Colorado River Roasters fresh-brewed coffee. Crazy fact: I don't enjoy coffee. I don't hate it, but after I quit it cold turkey in 2007, I never went back. I've had a cup here and there, but can't find satisfaction in the bitterness or after-taste. This Colorado River Roasters coffee? SO good. I drank it black with just a sprinkle of raw sugar and it was delicious.

Plus, the coffee went deliciously with their housemade Beignets. Oh, these beignets were good. Lily and I are huge beignet fans and these did not disappoint. They were served with housemade jam and vanilla-scented mascarpone. YUM! For entrees, Lily and I shared the special of the day: BBQ Pulled Pork Hash (tender pork, good BBQ sauce, delicious breakfast potatoes, and beautifully poached eggs on toast) and Shrimp and Grits (perfectly cooked shrimp, creamy grits, thick bacon, fried over-easy eggs, and pico de gallo). My fiancé had the Golden-Brown Pancakes served with chicken apple sausage and maple syrup. He was super happy with the pancakes and for good reason, they were some of the best pancakes I've had. 

Everything was delicious, but those Shrimp and Grits were out of this world. It had a crazy amount of ""soup"" with it that seemed out of place (I've seen photos of that dish without the soup), but it still worked. Throwing the bacon and eggs in there was a very good call.

Aside from the food, the place had a positive atmosphere and the service was great. The only downfall to the service was towards the end when we were all ready to pay. We pulled out our cards and placed them on the table, only to have the owner walk up and say ""Can you pay with one card?"", abruptly leaving and then coming back with a receipt paper that had ""only one payment per table"" written on it and harshly walked away again without saying anything. I felt this was very unprofessional and rude especially coming from the owner. The payment rule, I feel, is such an inconvenience to the customer since everyone splits checks now a days.

In so we wait and we wait and we wait . The host went up to her 3 times telling her that there are customers waiting hat need that table and she didn't even move. Three different party's of 5 or more came a left because the wait was going to be so long and being that there were  tables for 2 open she wouldn't even move. The worse part was when her and her guest were done eating and he left she sat there by herself on a table for 6 doing paperwork for another 30 min. Me and my husband would have left I'd it wasn't for our kids wanting to eat there. We will never go back and in fact 2 people have asked us about the place and we told them we wouldn't recommend it.

I suggested Eat. Located in the newly upgraded downtown Fremont East Community, this is one of the first new restaurants to open and it still thrives today after its opening three years ago.

It's been a year since I've been to this restaurant, and many of my coworkers have never been there.

I was so happy my coworkers was to experience the phenomenon that is from Chef Natalie's creative menu and her ""stick to your ribs"" hearty breakfasts. 

My only concern was wait time to get in...good thing we came early.

We arrived at 9am and already the restaurant was 2\/3rds full. 

We were seated quickly and met up with a hostess who offered us drinks and the special of the day: scotch eggs.

Of course we ordered the scotch eggs over a small stack of pancakes as an appetizer, along with the cinnamon biscuits topped with fruit compote, & deep fried deviled eggs!

I ordered my usual favorite, chicken fried steak and eggs with country style potato hash.

Note: all eggs are prepared to preference.

Other plates ordered was the corned beef and hash, shrimp and grits and the steak, egg avocado breakfast sandwich.

The food was amazing as the first time I had come previously. It was not a disappointment!

The portions are huge!

Warning, this is NOT for the dainty eater, you need to come hungry. However, they do have to go boxes if needed! 

If you're in downtown Fremont, stop by this place for a fulfilling eating experience, then walk it off while touring the shops at container park or go have fun in the casinos on Fremont experience.



Bon appetite!

Food for thoughts:
- The Chicken Fried Steak (hardy and delicious, a definite food comatose)
- Strawberry and biscuits (I was very leery about this but this was refreshing, a must order)
- Eggs Benedict platter (cooked perfectly and good choice if you like eggs benedict)
- Corn beef hash (hard to mess this up, but it was pretty good)
- Bacon (how does one ever hate bacon jk)

I have been craving beignets for so long, you'd think there would be more places that serve them! Anyway, I came here on a Friday morning and parking was not difficult to find. It was just street parking so bring quarters for the meter. The place wasn't too busy, there were plenty of open tables, but we still waited close to 10 min. 

Food wise, we had to get the beignets to start. When they came, they were smaller than expected. They're also denser than I like, but still quite good. They reminded me of a sugar doughnut hole. The best part of them was the seasonal jam and vanilla scented mascarpone as the dipping sauces. I put so much of those on, it was like eating the dipping sauces with a side of beignet. 

For the rest of the meal, the 2 others joining me had the Two Eggs any style with the smashed potatoes, while I tried the Chilaquiles. The Two Eggs any style was nothing to write home about. It was exactly as described, two eggs any style, a slice of bacon, bread, and some potatoes. The ""smashed potatoes"" were just cubed potatoes with some seasoning, which was a bit lacking. We all thought it was overpriced since nothing was particularly outstanding. My Chilaquiles was pretty tasty, it was essentially scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers over tortilla chips, a sort of breakfast nachos. But the chicken sausage that was sitting on top was a bit too sweet for the dish, it just stood out too much. 

The staff was fairly friendly, however the one waitress that brought our check was not exactly rude, but she had some attitude when holding the check out for us. She didn't say anything, but from her body language, she looked annoyed at us for no reason. 

Overall, this place was alright. It's a decent breakfast spot but I don't think there's much here to actually crave.",1,0,0

Within the group, we ordered the truffled egg sandwich, two eggs\/bacon\/chive potatoes, and arugula salad.  The truffled egg sandwich came on a ciabatta bun with mushrooms, eggs, and bacon.  The chive potatoes were delicious and seemed to be sprinkled with some sort of magical sour cream and chives powder.   The bacon was cooked well but didn't leave us wowed.  On the menu, they also have beignets all day and also a breakfast menu until 11am.  The prices were about $10 each, which was extremely reasonable given the amount of food.

So I came here with my wife and good friend to have some breakfast months ago and going there i realized pulling up that i had to pay for parking. I think all restaurants should have a designated area to park or offer free parking with a punch card kind of like going to a casino and having validated parking.

Lets get to the meal we ordered alot of things. My wife had the Shrimp n Grits (4\/5 stars) I had my usual Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which didn't really wow me so (3\/5) Also Ordered Grilled Cheese and A Order Of pancakes Both (3\/5).

Nothing here is really memorable besides the shrimp and grits so i definitely recommend it. Other than that service is solid and i know this place will do just fine because people love to come eat breakfast. And as long as they keep their ingredients fresh which they do they will be a popular eatery for a long time.

Our server came up to our table to take our order but he wasn't even looking at us while we were ordering. He called out a friends name in the middle of my order and continued to not make eye contact with our table while scribbling on his pad. 

My table ordered the fried deviled eggs (only thing I would recommend), shrimp & grits, corn hash, grilled cheese & tomato soup, and the truffle egg sandwich. 

Shrimp & grits: coming from the south, I've had my share of shrimp and grits and this one was just horrible. The grits had no seasoning what so ever and the sauce that came on top has no flavor at all. I don't eat my food salty and I actually enjoy grits just plain, but this dish was just horrible. I was tempted to send it back to the kitchen, but since we were there with guest I just poured hot sauce on it... 

Grilled cheese and tomato soup: gigantic piece of toast with some cheese on it and watered down tomato soup. Pass. 

I can't rate the other dishes. I love variety so I always taste the other dishes at the table, but I wasn't even tempted to get a taste of anyone else's dish.

I also had a cup of Guatemalan coffee, creamy smooth and perfectly brewed for $3.

We had the huevos mutalenos and the pancakes. Apparently the huevos dish was voted best hangover food in Vegas... It was delicious, the perfect blend of spicy, sweet and savory. The fried bananas were a great touch! That dish was great, but what really shocked us was how delicious the pancakes were! They were so unique too, perfectly cooked and crisp on the edges, they were the best pancakes I have ever had!

I also had the posole. Mind you, this was my first time trying posole. IT WAS THE BEST! I went with my boyfriend, and he didn't believe me when I said it was so great. He tried it, and instantly fell in love. He rarely does this with Mexican dishes because he is Mexican himself. We were so impressed by the food, we said to ourselves that we had to come back the morning before we leave back to California. 

Surely enough, we did. I went there looking to order the exact same thing: tofu scramble with light jalapeños with a half bowl of posole. We were burdened with bad news. They change the menu on the weekends, so the only time you can get the posole is during the week. This the ONLY reason why I had to give it four stars instead of five.

Let's be clear, I am not a fan of runny eggs! This dish however, is delicious and amazing! It was spicy and sweet, that's the banana, I loved the blend of flavors! The bill came in at $43+ tip. A bit more than I would like to pay at breakfast, however, the portions were large and we did order the two most expensive entrees. Definitely worth a repeat visit!",0,0,0

We were there on a Sunday and they closed at 2pm as it said on Yelp, I called just to make sure and they told me their last seating was at 1:30pm and yes they close at 2. 

We walked in around 1:15pm, party of 2 and were seated right away. I looked over to my left to see this girl eating this huge portion of Chicken Fried Streak...it looked really good and I almost ordered it but after reading on Yelp how everyone loved the Shrimp & Girts I decided I would just have to come back for what she had. 

My friend ordered the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup, she said it was amazing. I enjoyed my Shrimp & Grits , so good I wanted more. Good size filling portions for sure.

We also shared a order of the Cinnamon Biscuits which I didn't expect them to come out the way they did all covered in the most beautiful strawberry sauce. I thought they were just going to be biscuits with a strawberry\/cinnamon jam to spread on to but oh no, it was like eating a dessert and since I don't like to share my dessert I was kind of sad I was sharing this...it was soooooo good. Whenever I come back I will always order the Cinnamon Biscuits to start. 

The only 2 things I didn't like about the place (and my reason I didn't give 5 stars) was they don't serve alcohol which I was surprised since it is Vegas, I really wanted to get a Mimosa or some kind of fun brunch drink....we just got off the plane a few hours ago and I was dying for something.  What I did get was the Passion Fruit Ice Tea which I wouldn't order again due to not tasting any of the passion fruit what so ever.

The restaurant is cute and very well decorated right up my alley.  

Once we stepped in we were greeted and seated right away, there were alot of people from law offices and downtown restaurants eating there on their lunch.

I decided to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich although everything sounded really good.  The sandwich consisted of eggs, feta, mushrooms, chives, and bacon on ciabatta bread.  They also served it with a side of Chive potatoe's.  I have a thing about feeling sick after eating too much eggs but I had no problem finishing this sandwich.

The food - I was really impressed with all of the flavors and everything we tasted was delicious. The freshly squeezed orange juice started everything off and I was very pleased.

It came recommended by my roommate as somewhere to try for brunch, so we made it a point to go as our last meal of the trip. The place was definitely busy, and for a group of 4 on a Sunday around noon, it was a good 15-20 minute wait at least? The food was worth it though. The portions are generous and the price is inexpensive! I got the grilled cheese and asked them to shove a side of bacon into it, and they were more than happy to accommodate me! Think 2 huge french toast slides grilled to crispy golden perfection, but still incredibly soft on the inside, with a big pile of crispy bacon with yummy cheddar cheese in the middle! The thing was huge, I only needed half of the sandwich to fill up! It came with a yummy tomato salad on the side, and if you know me, tomatoes, bacon and grilled cheese is possibly the best combination ever. I also tried their pancakes, and for $9 you get 3 huge fluffy pancakes that are serious some of the fluffiest melt in your mouth pancakes I've tasted! Definitely worth the price!

Very quaint\/cozy restaurant, but gets busy during peak times. Our waiter was not very friendly during our meal unfortunately; maybe he was busy but he just seemed disinterested. Though, when he waited on other tables during our meal, I overheard him mentioning the specials for the day, which he completely failed to mention to us. =\

Prices were moderate. Food-wise, the food was pretty good. My friend and I shared sweet and savory dishes (see photos).

We walked in and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes for a party of 5. 35 minutes later, we were still waiting. In that time, they seated 7 parties of 2 and 3 that came in after us. They kept assuring us that they simply needed a table large enough for us (and they couldn't possibly put two smaller tables together, for unknown reasons).

After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, two tables opened up at the same time. One was a 6 top, one was a 4 top. They tried to seat the 5 of us at the 4 top. (Side note, their 4 tops are NOT large by any means). Now, at least 2 of the other parties that came in AFTER us and were seated BEFORE us were seated at other 4 tops. 

At this point we politely said no, we wanted the 6 top so we could sit comfortably. They went the consult the owner (I'm assuming she was the owner, she was a female with short curly hair who wasn't wearing the standard black uniform). The owner then rolled her eyes and, said, ""Yeah, well I want a million dollars."" She didn't realize our party was standing directly behind her and to the left, so we were able to hear the conversation very clearly.

Isn't that lovely? After making us wait 45 minutes, we are being unreasonable by asking for a table that will actually seat all of us, when there is one available right there. They did eventually, reluctantly, seat us at the 6 top.

Pity, several members of our party were actually big fans of this place, but you can't come back from such terrible customer service. The biggest problem, honestly, was the fact that they tried to seat us at the 4 top after a 45 minute wait with an open 6 top right next to us. Several of our party has worked in food service and we understand waits taking longer sometimes due to parties sitting around chatting. But treating us like we're being demanding for wanting space to sit AFTER such a wait is unacceptable. The owner's comment was the final nail in the coffin to assure we never return. Clearly this place has no appreciation for it's customers.",19,3,0

-parking IS hard to find. We came on Sunday around 11AM and all street parking was full. We lucked out to one last empty spot. Also, you don't have to feed the meters on the weekends so that was a plus.

-Expect to wait for a table. The restaurant is small and constantly busy so don't come here hangry. We were quoted 15-20 minutes for a party of 2 but only had to wait about 5.

-The cinnamon biscuits were hyped up the way it should be. It was delicious!!!! I'm not normally a sweets kinda gal for breakfast items but wow....the strawberry syrup along with sliced strawberries and whole blueberries were yummy. This plate came with four small sized cinnamon biscuits...which to me, looked like pancakes.

-Boyfriend got the country fried steak with scrambled eggs and chives potatoes. He really enjoyed it. We both agreed we made the right choice with what we ordered and would definitely order it again.

Only reason why I knocked off one star was the bathroom situation. ONLY ONE BATHROOM EACH for men and women. One bathroom!? Are you kidding me? Is this a gas station? I'm sorry, I understand it's in downtown LV and there's always homeless and drunk tourists roaming around asking for bathrooms left and right but damn....the least you can do is supply two bathrooms each for us! Of the 45 minutes we were there, both times I tried going to the bathroom and there was always someone in there. Thank goodness I didn't need to take a number 2! 
At one point, there were 4 men waiting to use the restroom. When there's a line for the men's bathroom....it's time to do something about it. So don't come eat here if you're hungover (because you'll either be peeing all morning or hugging the toilet bowl) or if you drank a lot of mimosas\/coffee.

The waitress I had was a different story she was the dumbest waitress I have ever encountered anywhere. I don't know what her name was and I doubt she could remember it if I asked her. She was tall and brown hair and cross eyed. First it took forever to bring us drinks because she forgot us multiple times. We asked for straws and I understand sometimes you run out of things but she was back searching for an eternity and came back with two straws (there were four of us) and asked who wanted them. Awkward. She should have just said they were out. She then brought us our check but it had already been paid by someone else....ok do we just leave? So we confronted her about it and she gave us some BS dumb answer how she misused the plus and subtracted our....what?! She ran in the back and we never saw the brown haired blond the rest of our visit. Thankfully the good looking restaurant manager swooped in and saved the day by fixing our check she was on top of things.

The servers are very friendly and relaxed, they stopped and chatted for awhile as we had some questions about the food and later about the area (the same owner is opening another restaurant (bar type food) in the development across the street).  A little slow with the bill because they apparently only have one credit card machine and wouldn't you know, everyone wanted to pay at the same time with a credit card! 

FOOD - the posole' is great - I love their posole'.  It tastes fresh and not too salty!  YUMMM!  We also ordered the ruben which was definitely one of the best I've ever had, but was huge!  Others at our table ordered the BLT which looked amazing and the egg truffle sandwich which was yummy for what it was, but isn't really my thing!!

We ended with the beignets and they are a deep fried donut.  So yes, naturally they are greasy, but that's what they are!!  It's like a pot roast that tastes like meat - well, of course it does!!  But they are fresh and just crisp enough with a two dipping sauces that you simply can't do without!!  I'm a fan!

So, I just ended up parking for free at the nearby El Cortez.  Think of it as a way to burn those calories post-meal.

Before my friend and I even stepped inside, the hostess opened the door with a smile and a cheery welcome. The place was loud and busy; luckily for us, there was one table available. The décor was tastefully done with some nice touches; for example, I love the ""I'll See You in the Flowers"" art piece on the wall.

The lunch menu is focused, unintimidating, and conventional: sandwiches, salads, and soups. The free range chicken sandwich with chips was delicious, moist, and slathered in pesto. Just the way I wanted it. The chips were crisp and seasoned well, but unmemorable. I wish they had seasoned fries or a side salad option. To most people, this will sound blasphemous, but one annoyance was the untrimmed fat on the chicken (personal preference). As for my friend, he happily inhaled his DWBLT and gave it two greasy thumbs up. Throughout the meal, our server beatifically refilled our waters and checked-in on us, while juggling his tables.

This place had been in our bookmarks for some time and we decided to finally try it. It was good but not great.

We had the shrimp and grits: bland. The shrimp were way over cooked and tough. The grits were soupy and not much flavor. The bacon was a limp
Mess and it was on the bottom of the plate and would have been better chopped up on top IMO. 

The egg and black bean tostada: just ok. Would not order it again. Large portion for sure, but bland. A bit soupy. 

The side of smoked bacon was very good. Thick but and not too crisp. 

The English muffin was nice, but a bit bland. It was made from scratch which was nice. It just needed some more salt in the dough. 

The country fried steak: really wanted this to be good but the meat was just too tough. It needs to be tenderized more and maybe a tad thinner. It had a great crisp breading, but just was like shoe leather in the mouth. Too bad. 

What looked really good was the scratch made biscuits with strawberry compote. We wish we had tried this. 

The coffee was OUTSTANDING. No bitterness and just so good.

Their grilled cheese and tomato soup is simple but to die for. The bread literally melts in your mouth. I've also had the Huevos Motulenos which was okay.
Service is always good. I love that you can see the open kitchen from the seating area as well.
If you are going for brunch, be aware that they do not serve alcohol so mimosas in the morning, are not an option here.
The owner and chef Natalie Young is fantastic and is opening another restaurant downtown. Can't wait! You can spot her overseeing the work in the kitchen or just hanging out on the bench outside. Makes dining so much more personal!",0,0,0

The area looked a little sketchy... but that didn't stop me from eating here. (also because I came in an Uber and I had to get out). ANYWAYS Arrived around 12:15pm on Sunday and there was a small wait. Service was great. Quick and helpful.

My friend and I shared the deviled eggs and truffled egg sandwich. The deviled eggs are SO. GOOD. It's basically deep fried egg white topped with the yolk toppings and bacon. Made perfectly. Could have eaten more but the cholesterol... This was definitely something I've never tried before and for $8, no regrets. The Truffled Egg Sandwich $13 + avocado $2 was pretty good too. I enjoyed the scrambled eggs.

Beef hash = good bite size but on the salty side (more than it needs to be)

Eggs Benedict = biscuit layer is thin and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The turkey bacon was a nice touch. Comes with a side of potatoes (super crunchy). Overall, I would recommend it!

Pancake = it was topped off with powdered sugar and comes with there own maple syrup! This is a must try!

Chicken Apple sausage = BOMB!

He got the huevos motulenos, which is a great menu option. This dish consists of two eggs over-easy with red & green new mexico chiles, black beans, peas, pico, feta, and sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. Vibrant, assertive flavors and nice presentation. The huevos motulenos is also a quite generous portion, as with everything else they serve.

I ordered the tofu scramble with mushrooms and home fries. His dish was definitely better than mine. I thought the tofu was a tad underseasoned, some salt and other spices would have made it less plain. Also, I was expecting tofu scrambled so that it actually resembled eggs; however, their version is actually cubed. I think stringy, egg-like bits would have made this dish more successful because the thinner, creamier texture would have soaked up any seasoning better. Still good, though could be better.

We shared the cinammon biscuits, and these babies were fantastic. The biscuits are smothered in strawberries and blackberries, which I loved. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the biscuits were thinner, and more similar to shortcake. Worked really well in this dish, and again, really beautiful plating.

This was before I was a Las Vegas resident but was in town for work. I was blown away then by the level of service and passion that went into the dishes then, and it has yet to disappoint me now as a resident. 

I've been back twice since moving here, so I suppose I'd call myself a regular at this point? Especially having only called Sun City home since early June. Sharing the Chicken Fried Steak is necessary because it's huge, but also a tasting experience that you want to remember with someone. The gravy is tantalizing and the potatoes are incredible. The corned beef hash is good, but I'm more of a shredded Corned Beef fan and this dish is small chunks. The toast is thick cut and perfect for soaking up that egg yolk. 

My most recent visit took me to the sandwich side of things. The chicken sandwich is simple, the bread perfectly toasted. I'd have added avocado, as the pesto didn't add as much flavor as I had hoped, but the menu clearly states that modifications will be politely declined. The grilled cheese should be framed. The thick cut toast filled with melted cheese makes me weak in the knees. And it's ideal for dipping into that cream based tomato soup. 

My heart belongs to the deviled eggs though. They won me over since my first visit and I'll always come back. Anything that claims to make giraffes dance is bound to be a winner. These eggs are no exception.",25,9,21

Eat uses sustainable and organic ingredients supplied locally and grown which they turn into delicious, innovative breakfast food.  Eat has Sweet & Savory (granola Greek yogurt, cinnamon biscuits, and golden-brown pancakes).  Also has steel-cut oats, huevos motulenos, chicken fried steak, and chilaquiles served daily.  Eggs entrees are served all day.  They also have Soups (black bean veggie chili, green child chicken posole, and tomato soup) in 2 serving sizes (half or full).  

We ordered the following -
Shrimp & Grits - has smoked bacon, two eggs over-easy & pick de gallo $15. If you never had grits or do not like grits; order this dish and you will changed your mind about grits.  This lovely and heavenly dish is very tasty and delicious; my all time favorite and I craved this all the time. 5 stars plus
Truffle Egg Sandwich (extra-Avocado) - comes with two scrambled eggs, wild mushrooms, green onions, feta, & bacon on ciabatta with chive potatoes $12. Plus $2. (Avocado) This is a gourmet sandwich! 5 stars
Arugula Salad - served with asparagus, oven-roasted tomatoes, parmigiano-reggiano, toasted while almonds & lemon herb vinaigrette $10. We love the fresh taste of the Arugula with asparagus tossed together salad. Very yummy! 5 stars

5 stars for friendly atmosphere and staffs. 

Eat's motto is ""Good food for good people, made with love in downtown Las Vegas""

Made sure we got to eat before their big brunch crowd or any crowd that would've gathered before and after the parade. It didn't take long for us to get a table - probably like 10 minutes after giving the hostess our name. 
Cute setting that definitely reminded me of a school cafeteria with a hipster spin. 
Everyone constantly checked on us during our meal, which was cool to see another establishment have all this teamwork. I think we had Gary as our server, and he was pretty cool. He recommended we have the Deviled Eggs as a starter, and we were not disappointed. In fact, the brother ate 3 out of the 4 we were supposed to split. Anyway...
The little brother had Huevos Motulenos, and I had the Corned Beef Hash. LOL. We definitely switched plates at one point to have a taste of both orders. Funny thought popped in my head: ""I feel like I'm back in Cali eating brunch... Vibe and fresh ingredients to make scrumptious breakfast!""
I gotta admit that the brother's plate was yummier than my staple though. I didn't think capers and peas would taste well with bananas, but it was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. My corned beef was pretty good. I mean you can't go wrong with this breakfast staple when it's fresh and not drenched in some kinda grease. LOL. I loved my Sourdough Bread that came with it!

The service was great. Drinks and food came out quickly. The waitress made sure we were satisfied with our food but didn't come around often enough to make it annoying. They had a smile on their faces and made me feel like they genuinely wanted us to enjoy our time. 
The owner was sitting out in the diner overlooking the operation of the restaurant and even pointing the staff to make sure things were getting done. I add this to point out the hard work and diligence that goes on at 'eat.'

We started off with the strawberry compote and it was amazing. It disappeared in all of five minutes. (Split this with a couple people before your meal. You will not regret it.)

I am glad to say her way is the right way. I love everything about Eat. from the restaurants decor and location. Both suggest an approachability and made me feel that this was somewhere where I can be myself. 
The menu, as many have stated before, is not that big but I'd rather have a small menu of amazing choices than a huge encyclopedia of a menu with minimal choices. The menu were pages attached to a clipboard, another show on how unpretentious but subtly creative this restaurant is, and cater majority to Brunch items. All menu items, I was happy to read on the bottom of the menu, are bought locally and I could tell by how fresh everything was. 
I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich which was suggested on Eater Vegas and the portion was bigger than I expected. It's eggs, bacon, mushrooms and feta cheese on ciabatta bread and it had a side of chive potatoes and a strawberry.  Everything was cooked to perfection! 
Overall, food was phenomenal and staff was friendly and efficient. The decor was nature meets industrial meets modern. There's a food counter available if you're alone and prefer to eat quickly while on a lunch break. Check out the art at the entrance of the restaurant which feature aspiring young artists which I thought was a great move on Chef Natalie Youngs part because she knows personally how great a helping hand is so that you can fully realize your dream and with this restaurant I can say without a doubt her dream has came into fruition.

Our server was earnest but not professional.  Not a complaint or disappointment but I mention it only because it slows down the meal which increases your chances of  standing in line waiting for a table.

We were looking for lunch around 11:30 on a Friday afternoon. We ran into a wait time at a few places, then sought out eat. We had to wait 20 minutes here too. Apparently unavoidable. It was bustling inside and noisy. It's a cute place with an industrial vibe. 

The service lacked any sincerity. We got everything we needed but there was no explanation of the menu of suggestions or conversation at all. 

The menu had a grilled cheese with tomato soup. I asked to substitute the green chicken chile pozole instead.   She said that would be A-OK for a $1 up charge. She also offered avocado and bacon on my sandwich. Of course! By no means did I expect this to be a free addition; however, it turned out to be a $6 charge which made my grilled cheese and soup somewhere in the neighborhood of $16. Yowsa. It was delightful. The sourdough bread was giant, no less than 1"" thick for each slice. It was soaked 3\/4 of the way through with butter. The sandwich was crispy, chewy, yummy and decadent. The pozole was spicy, and very flavorful. Loads of veggies and shredded chicken. Very good. I shared it with my little guy and still had leftovers to take home. It was a generous portion. 

My compadres enjoyed their arugula salad and chicken sandwich very much. We all drank water. The bill was $45 for 2 sandwiches and a salad. So $18 each for lunch. I guess not bad. Gotta pay the price to hang with the in crowd!

After seeing all the reviews and praise for the Huevos Montulenos, I decided to give it a go, even tho on paper it sounded horrid. I like weird combinations, so I was willing to give it a shot. My friend got the Eggs Benedict. 

Food arrives. A few bites into our food, both of look at each other, and I know exactly what she is thinking. I told her mine was really gross and she agreed. I like peas, I like bananas and I love feta. But the combination of them with black beans and eggs and sauce didn't work for me. I made her give it a try and she was mad at me once she put it in her mouth (hey, sharing is caring). I tried her Benny's and I agreed they were underwhelming. Turkey bacon had no flavor, and the addition of spinach and tomatoes really overpowered the Hollandaise.

Great pancakes! Some of the best in Las Vegas (stiff completion with DuPar's and Babystacks).  Pancakes are as good as advertised.  Golden brown, crispy edges, well cooked middle, fresh-tasting batter.  Nice touch serving real maple syrup and a seasonal fruit garnish.

Unfortunately, the chicken fried steak I had didn't live up to expectations.  The meat had tough spots that made it hard to cut and eat.  The gravy is not the classic white gravy I like, but a brown gravy with a green herb and scallions (?).  The gravy had plenty of sausage, but the green herbs\/scallions dominated the flavor...which I disliked.  I think it was fried in a fryer, while I prefer my chicken-fried steak be pan fried.

Location -
eat. is located on the corner of Carson and 7th street.  There's plenty of meter parking and it is tucked just far enough away from LV Blvd to be easy access.  It wouldn't be downtown if there weren't a few questionable characters hanging around, but this place is an oasis.  

Food -
First time I split the DWBLT with homemade chips (and the really good pickle is aptly named) and the Argula Salad with added chicken breast.  Although the upcharge for the chicken was a little $$, I can assure you it is worth your money.  This salad was very nicely done.  Fresh argula, asparagus, roast almonds and roasted tomatoes.  Definitely unique. Loved both, but I prefer a lighter lunch (although judging by some of my frequent lunch hangouts, you may be calling me a liar) so may not order the DWBLT again.  That sourdough bread is seriously delicious and seriously heavy.   

Second trip, I had the Banh Mi Chicken sandwich.  This thing was freaking awesome!  I just love jalapeno coleslaw especially when you throw some radishes in the mix!  Chips again because they are just that good.  I also stole a bite of the grilled cheese sandwich dipped in tomato soup.  Yum!

Service -
Both trips, service has been great.  The servers are hipster enough to prove you are downtown, but not so hipster they forget how to smile.  Love the open kitchen, the entire decor and just the vibe of this place.  It really is something special and further proof that downtown is worth revitalizing and worth a visit for lunch.",7,4,6

It's about 10 minutes from the strip and parking was easy (meter parking). Also the name of the restaurant is in a cool stylized font with the whole period thing at the end of the word eat--just makes you want to eat, right?

I went with the Huevos Motulenos which I honestly didn't like--I'm not sure why so many people are nuts over this dish. I feel like the salsa just doesn't go well in a main course. It was an interesting concoction of food items I've never really had together but I wish I had gotten something else. I wanted to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich but they only serve it Monday through Friday. Their pancakes are huge.

I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't because were somewhat duped into buying an appetizer. So, you know how lots of restaurants give you free bread before your meal? Our waitress asked us, after serving us water, ""would you like some biscuits?"" Well, to us this sounded like pre-meal free bread so we said yes. What she really meant to say is, ""would you like to start with an appetizer called the 'cinnamon biscuits, warm strawberry compote'?"" The money wasn't the issue, but the trickery into ordering more on the menu. She might as well have started by saying, ""would you like to start with the Dom Perignon?""

I went to EAT. quite some time ago. It was the best food I had eaten while I was in Vegas for a business trip (week-long). I wish I had been there sooner. I heard about it from Anthony Bourdain's show and how he raved about Natalie Young's talents as a young up-and-coming chef. 

The menu is smallish, but what EAT. does make is delicious, quality food (over quantity). Anyone who has been to an upscale restaurant or a specialty restaurant recognizes right away a smaller menu means the chef has chosen meals with the finer ingredients and has a technique that surpasses that of a larger menu.  Their portion-size actually is quite large. But...this is the U.S. and Vegas (if you're a mainstream tourist you expect a certain variety and type of food).  Also, it's a small cafe and not a huge banquet room restaurant. Complaining about a party of 11-people is ridiculous.  I was actually at the end of a vicious cold when I was in Vegas, and the food there was healthy-ish and also delicious. (Take note of the veggie burger but also the gourmet meat selection.)

I even took a meal with me for the plane because it was that good. 

Also, a side note is the area around EAT. should be explored. It's in OLD VEGAS meaning it's the historical sites for the BRAT PACK (original one with Sinatra Sammy D. Jr.) and many films classic film fans might recognize! I enjoyed being away from the crowd, and being able to walk without smoke being blown in my face. There are also many grassroots efforts in the area as art galleries. I even walked by the PAWN STARS pawn shop on my way back to my hotel (that is in the main ""new"" strip of Vegas). 

ENJOY!!! Also, I highly doubt there was a hair on the plate and the waitress ignored that one writer. More likely the writer was disgruntled from something about the food\/restaurant and then plucked out the hair and wrote a crappy review. 

 Most Americans consume food seasoned with salt (in many cases MSG for pre-made sauces and fast food), and sugar. EAT. makes their food fresh and from scratch which also makes some of these comments moot points for me. For example, see the review on a critique of a Hollandaise sauce and bacon. Likely these ""bold flavors"" she describes comes out of a package not fresh cream or real bacon (that hasn't been treated with a ton of nitrates). And also, the comment about the ""banana"" on the bottom of ""Mexican food goodness""--likely this writer mistook a different Latin-American inspired dish (perhaps from El Salvador where the cuisine uses plantains) for Mexican food. Because, duh, all Americans know Mexican food, but not much else in terms of different Latin-American national foods.  If she would have tasted the said ""banana"" she might have discovered it was delicious! (And discovered a new national cuisine). Many of these bad reviews are proof there's not a lot of food in our food anymore. I suspect, some of these readers don't recognize (or don't have a palate for) real food anymore. In short, take some of these reviews with a grain of salt and look at their website or listen to Bourdain's review.",1,0,0

This unnecessarily loud (due to the not-so-background music) is overwhelmingly disappointing.

My wife's corned beef hash (which is grossly overpriced at somewhere around $12-$14) wasn't anything special at all, though she did like the green onions that were in it.

Came here on a Saturday morning , so there was a bit of a wait (around 25-30 min.) but I didn't mind.

Atmosphere-wise , I love the charm this place has , just exactly what downtown needs :) It's located across Container Park so it's a pretty popular spot.

Food-wise , I already had my heart set on the cinnamon biscuits (w\/ strawberry compote and powdered sugar) 8$. I don't think I ever had biscuits in my life but this is probably my new favorite breakfast food. The strawberry compote wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. DEFINITELY ORDER THIS. My friend who recommended this place to me also told me to order the truffled egg sandwich 12$. It was super good , everything was put together well. The scrambled eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly , and the mushrooms and feta cheese complimented the sandwich well. The chive potatoes were great , but taste better with the hot sauces provided on the side. If you don't like breakfast foods , they have soups , salads, and sandwiches available.

Service-wise , hostess was very kind and she reminded us of the breakfast specials today. Our server Roberto on the other hand , not so much. I don't like bagging on servers but we just got the vibe from him that he felt disinterested the whole time. Right after we were seated , he jotted down our orders and that was the last time we saw him. At least our food came out quick but he never checked up on us , asked how was our food , or any refills. Literally three different people asked me in less than a span of 5 min just to ask if I was done with my potatoes although I was still eating them and even had a fork in my hand. Three people can ask me if I'm done with my plate , but not notice my glass is empty. 

If you're looking for a breakfast place , I recommend this place because the food was excellent. Best breakfast I had in a long time. Just don't have high expectations about service. Also note , when it's busy they will only accept one credit card. Hostess offered to split the bill in half for two cards though.",2,2,2

When I put our name on the list, the hostess said ""I'm going to need you to finish that ice tea before you get seated"" there is no way I could finish it that fast. I found this completely ludicrous. I only drink a certain kind of tea that most restaurants don't serve. If they don't have it, I always order water, so it's not like they were missing out on a huge beverage sale by letting me bring my tea in. I completely understand if I came in with an alcoholic drink but that wasn't the case. I was so annoyed by this that we decided to leave and went to another nearby restaurant instead, one that could've cared less about my tea. So they lost out on much more money by us leaving than they would've by just allowing me to have my tea. I go out to eat several times a week. I have never, ever been told I cannot bring my tea in.

We went for Sunday brunch, and when I walked in, I did think, ""Man, this place is loud,"" but when I saw a live DJ in the corner, I couldn't help but smile. The entire vibe makes you feel like ish is happening here every day. The interior is just perfect with concrete floors, spring-like colors and an open kitchen for you to witness the creation of your eats. We ate at the counter and loved it. 

Service was a little aloof, but I was too distracted by all the tattoos to really care. I think they just really mean business. 

The menu itself is a work of art worth reading down to every last bite. The dishes are creative and well-thought out. You know there is a real love of food just by reading the possibilities. We ordered the Huevos Motulenos, Turkey Benedict (only available during weekend brunch) and a short stack of pancakes ($5!!). The Motulenos features a mind-dizzying array of ingredients, including sauteed bananas! Mixed in with two chilis and a variety of beans, it turned out to be a delicious dish of sweet and spicy. And, the breakfast potatoes were legit. Basically, chop up a potato and make it sizzle. A true tater. The Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach was also a winning combination of flavors. I swear I tasted basil, but whatever I tasted, I approve. The only slight complaint there was that it came out lukewarm. 

Now, the pancakes deserve their own paragraph, but can be best summarized with one word: perfect! They managed to have crispy, but not burnt, edges and a soft, milky center. They were the perfect thinness, making it all too easy to devour a short stack all by your lonesome. 

Worth noting: While the weekday menu includes tofu scramble and a tofu banh mi, I didn't notice any vegan options on the brunch menu. Might be worth calling if you're a vegan headed there for a weekend brunch.  

My only other minor complaint is that I thought the coffee was a little weak. However, that in no way prevents me from respecting this culinary gem. It's just so cool, a true Vegas original.",29,7,24

yup that's what my fiancé and I did as soon as we got our food.  Truffled egg sandwich was amazing ... nothing to complain about here, perfect portion for the price and very flavorful.  My fiancé ordered shrimp and grits I wished it had a little more seasoning to it which I just added cholula to it to kick it up a bit.  It was a little too ""tomatoey"" to me like a ceviche salsa, but maybe that's what they're going for ... if so you guys did ... nailed it.  The pancakes were a perfect blend of fluffy and crispy ... not burnt.   We enjoyed the food and no complaints about the service.  

The only thing I dislike is you have to pay to park.  Being spoiled in Las Vegas usually you can find free parking somewhere, but for this location it would be quite a walk to find that.  So be aware, since this restaurant isn't too large you might need to put a few more quarters or dollars in your meter when they get packed.",1,1,1

From the moment we entered we loved it. It has a very hip ambience and it is very modern. We got seated and my husband ordered the pomegranate tea which he tells me was wonderful, but I can't be sure because all tea tastes like mud water to me. Bleh. 

We ordered the cinnamon biscuits which came drizzled in their homemade jam and fruit. We weren't actually too impressed with this dish, the biscuits were a little dry but the sauce made up for it. What was amazing was our main entree. We ordered two eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon. Perfection. The potatoes were amazing. I can only dream of a way to recreate their parsley potatoes. Even the toast was way more delicious than regular toast and I can't discover why. The bacon was also delicious. Something else amazing was their specialty honey. I could drink it for days. 

Our waiter however was a bit rude, he made rude comments to a friend of ours for ordering two appetizers in lieu of an entree. Taking off one star for that and the dry biscuits. Other than that, magnifique!",2,0,1

So we arrive in this seedy little area in Vegas. Trestaurantunt is located underneath a old apartment building. Aside from the rest of the building the place is really nice. Its modern with black modern sign and concrete floors and lots cool kidkid type furniture etc. it has a buzz about it like its got a local following. Justeppingnbg in the door made me feel like we were experiencing a insider place locals are enjoying. I am up for that type thing.....

I ordered the Posole, this is a great hangover meal! Just the smell was good enough to pull me in. It has all the favorites Mexicanxican Posole would have, hominy, pork, broth etc. It was good. Although it was served in a shallow bowl so I would have appreciated to have a little more.

My wife ordered a wedge salad topped with huge shrimp. Her meal looked awesome. The shrimpCajuna cajun type seasoning that was spicy. It was good. the blue cheese dressing was excellent as well. 

My mom ordered a uneventful chicken pot wasn'tShe wasnt impressed, And I trust judgmentjudgement.

Very difficulty to get a refill on my coffee. I had to approach the kitchen counter to get coffee.don'twice.


I dont think I will go here again, but if I ""end up here"" I know what to avoid and I know to expect to get my own coffee.",0,0,0

There was a three man band outside front door - totally unexpected and really charming.  Restaurant was decorated very well - industrial chic with fresh vibrant colors.  Location was in a good spot in the heart of Fremont East ""downtown.""

The food I'd give it just an OK rating.  Had pancakes, which you cant really screw those up.  They were good.  The chicken or turkey sausage on top was a bit odd tasting.  I covered in ketchup to be able to eat.  We also ordered the Grilled Cheese with tomato soup - that was the surprising dish.  I expected so much more.  The cheese was dry and hard.  The amount of bread was overwhelming - way too much.  The soup was no better than what would come from a can.  Almost flavorless.  I can make better grilled cheese at home and Bar + Bistro has to die for tomato soup.  

I think overall, the food had an off day.  I'd go back and try some other things just because of ambiance and location and I like to give em' a 2nd try.",1,1,0

I just had breakfast there and I was so compelled to immediately write a review. Eat is located in an area of Downtown that is being redeveloped. I'd say that this place is probably the impetus of redevelopment in its immediate area - the area looks like it could be kinda sketchy at night. But it was fine when I went in the morning. In fact, they are only open until 3pm, so don't be scared and check them out!

Walking in to the restaurant, I really got a hip, trendy, downtown feeling - exactly what I'm looking for when visiting any downtown restaurant in any city. I was promptly greeted and seated. I sat at the counter, which overlooks the open-kitchen. 

The staff working there seem to match the hip, downtown look the restaurant is going for - tattoos, t-shirts and funky hair. I must've stood out with my clean cut look, but hey there are a lot of businesses in the area so I'm sure the ""corporate"" folk come here too, especially for lunch. 

I ordered the truffled egg sandwich, which, thanks to Yelp, seems to be one of the more popular items. My food came out quickly and I was a lot of food! The sandwich was in a perfectly toasted croissant and was topped with eggs, mushrooms and very crisp bacon. It came with a side of potatoes.

Service is horrible. No one smiles or introduces themselves. A guy take our drink  order, a women comes takes our order. Neither of the servers are pleasant or friendly.  I let her know that I would like to order a sandwich to go toward the end of the meal. Food comes out quickly. 
My friend got the grilled cheese with avocado. It's average. The passion ice tea is really good. My eggs Benedict is drowning in the hollandaise sauce. I can't even enjoy all the ingredient bc the sauce is taking over the plate. I look around and others have egg Benedict's who have a lot less sauce than us, and even strawberries in their plate!  
The check is dropped while I'm still eating. Uncomfortable. I never get to order my sandwich to go bc the server honestly never really came back. Sure I could've got her attention but at this point i would take my business else where.
The cherry on top is I asked if the orange juice was fresh squeezed. The guy tells me yes. I ordered a small and it's definitely not fresh squeezed. I am charged for a large. I don't even bother to correct the $6.00 mistake. I'm just so over it at this point.",1,0,0

I settled on breakfast (because breakfast is the best!) and ultimately decided on the Truffled Egg Sandwich. First of all, it was ginormous, and came served with a GENEROUS portion of potatoes. They were more than happy to sub turkey bacon for regular bacon (thank you!) and it was great... not the kind of turkey bacon that leaves you feeling deprived. I did polish off the sandwich, but couldn't finish the potatoes, even with help.

For some of my friends who got toast with their dishes, wow, I have never seen toast so thick! It looked like thick cut French toast, but was just regular old toast. The ginger ale was also fantastic and I heard the coffee was, too.

Our server was delightful and knowledgeable about the menu.

Service wasn't good at all. Not attentive, friendly, or nice. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and I was given lemonade. I see things like this as a simple mistake so I kindly asked for tea since I ordered half and half. The server (we actually had three people just rotating the whole time) told me that there was probably tea in it, and I just can't tell because the tea is very subtle. I continued to tell her it was just lemonade but she said ""yeah it's just the tea isn't really prominent"" ... Then when another lady came to refill my drink, she topped it off with the house tea that I asked for. Seeing as how I barely touched my drink... It was weird to me that the tea instantly made my drink darker and the taste was definitely prominent. But I guess that was too hard for the first lady.
Our food came out within fifteen minutes which really surprised me because there were quite a few others there as well.
No complaints with my eggs benedict, just thought it was a little pricey. The chicken fried steak was cold and soggy. Almost like it had been pre cooked and re heated. I could tell the flavor was there but overall it just wasn't appetizing because it didn't taste or feel fresh at all. We had no one check on our table to see how the food was. But of course they didn't hesitate to drop the check at the table and walk away.

We have tried several times to eat here but they were either closed or I just was pressed for time and couldn't wait as they're always packed. 



We arrived at around noon and it was stated it would be 25 minute wait. I waited outside patiently with my guy and we were seated about 20 minutes later. We sat down and my guy went back to the car to make sure we paid the parking meter. I waited about  10 minutes to even be acknowledged by anyone. The wait staff and kitchen staff were very busy and everyone running around this fairly average sized place. After a gentlemen took our drink order I waited patiently for my guy to come back. I thought he brought sanitizer back as I didn't bring anything in with me besides my phone. So I got up to head to the restroom so I could wash my hands. As packed as this restraunt gets I had to wait for the restroom. The lady who exited explained they ran out of paper towels and let a wait staff member know , but she just continued to fill drinks and then completely disappeared. So i made serveral attempts at making eye contact in hopes of being able to flag down someone to refill them. While staff members just gave me blank stares and ignored me. Finally a waitress with her hands full informed me they were in a cabinet inside the bathroom and tried to open it with her shoe while her hands were full of dirty plates and ketchup and hot sauce bottles mind you she's all the way inside the bathroom. Finally another girl came to put them in, informed me they didn't carry toilet seat liners when I asked about them. It was brought to my attention after my guy had used the restroom told me the girl who I had asked about liners was talking about me to other employees saying I was lucky they had toilet paper. 

This is not the type of service I hope to recieve in a McDonald's. After an almost 30 minute wait and the rude customer service I was hoping the food would be okay. Which it was decent. I won't lie about that. 

Shortly after we received our food but I was just so upset I didn't enjoy my meal. My guy had the shrimp and grits and since I'm not a fan of shrimp I didn't even bother to try. My corned beef was a bit on the small side but I did enjoy the sourdough toast it came with. Very buttery and crispy. Yum ! The pancake was a standard pancake nothing special.

We were staying at the D and I didn't want a breakfast buffet for the second day in a row. I saw this place was only a couple blocks away, the photos and menu looked promising so we headed over.

For a Vegas visitor, the walk down Carson at 8am can seem a little sketch but have no fear! When we walked in it was cozy and cute and trendy in a very non-intimidating way. We opted to sit at the counter since every seat was full (30 minutes after opening!) and I'm really glad we did. Our pink-haired waitress was SO friendly, helpful and overall just seemed like a super positive person, which was a great start to our day. Plus, we got to watch the action in the kitchen and the chef was really commanding her own back there. 

I had the Truffled Egg Sandwich, which was super tasty. Scrambled Eggs with sautéed mushrooms, chives, feta and kick-ass bacon on a ciabatta roll. So freaking good. It came with Chive Potatoes, which were cooked pretty perfectly. BF had the egg dish that came with beans, peas, feta and some other stuff on a corn tortilla and he loved it. The salsas that were on top were so good. 

We HAD to split a pancake because they looked amazing. It was. Perfect crispy edges with a fluffy middle. I could eat these all day.

Thank you, eat.!

When one is stuck in the saddest place is the world that is Las Vegas, one's skin might crawl. Mine actually itches. eat was such a pleasant respite from the strip mall hell that is most of that town, and it really brings it with the food and the atmosphere.

--Great music playing that's not too loud.

--Fantastic food with something for everyone (and generous portion sizes like the rest of this town).

--We had the truffled egg sandwich minus bacon (hey people, if one doesn't get bacon can you PLEASE add something else or take off some money?!), the arugula\/asparagus salad, and a side of cheesy grits. Everything was delicious, and the home fries that come with the egg sandwich are actually REAL home fries, as in, crisped and tossed with onion. We saw a number of delicious-looking menu items gets sent out from our counter\/kitchen-view seats. The housemade veggie burger looked particularly amazing too.

--Also, coffee!! The first\/only decent coffee I had on the whole trip, and you can get Sugar in the Raw.

--Leftovers NOT packed in styrofoam!! Hallelujah! While the rest of Las Vegas attempts to kill the environment and the humans in it at every turn, here at eat you can get leftovers packed in paper!

We had counter seats with a view (and ear) to the kitchen. We figured out why there are so many complaints about service. It is slow and inconsistent, and frequently there were up to 8 meals ready to go out to tables, but servers weren't taking them as fast as the kitchen was working. Also, for some reason, instead of table numbers or seat numbers, one person would say ""This is for the heavyset gentleman in the hat over there"" rather than ""This is table 11."" Very odd. 

Our service was fine, and we weren't in a hurry but I hope if any owner\/manager reads this you'll take the service complaints to heart. They seem valid. Also, vegetarians really hate having to ask for a left-off ingredient like bacon, prosciutto, sausage (things with an upcharge) but not getting offered something for a sub or $1 off.

As for the food, the standouts for us were the Truffled Egg Sandwich and the pancakes. The pancake had a sublime lightness to them with a perfectly thin crispy exterior. Seriously one of the best I've had in a long time. Potatoes on the side were great as well. Other food was less than amazing (Chicken Fried Steak tasted good, but was just a little over done and the steak wasn't pounded quite thin enough, and Chilaquiles just lacked some oomph), but still good for the eating.

Well worth the trip to downtown LV. Afterwards, we walked through the Container Park right across the street. Neat stuff.",1,0,1

Why is Tony in there every time I'm there?  He steals all of the good service.

My last visit at eat. there were extra tons of people with cameras and video recorders.  Looked like they were setting up to film a show inside because even a dude was getting his make up Did.  

$4 orange juice.  But anyway the last two visits were on weekdays, I really need to go on a weekend because the menu is different.  But so far I've had the Mediterranean Egg White Frittata Spinach which came with tomatoes, Kalamata olives, feta and basil with whole wheat English muffin.  That was good, so healthy.  When I saw the English muffin I tried to sneak in and ask if they can make me an eggs benedict, but nope.  Then for my latest visit I had the Smoked Salmon Cream cheese, capers, sliced tomatoes, red onion and rye bread.  It was laid out neatly but I made a mess of it, it's a normal dish that can be found on your weekend brunch but I was honestly craving for their weekend brunch items.  

It just means I need to go back, park somewhere free, sit down, eat while taking my time rather than rushing.

And don't be fooled by the appearance of the neighborhood, when you go in you are in a completely different environment.  You wouldn't think a restaurant like this is located in downtown Las Vegas.",7,8,7

We were staying near the strip, so going to Downtown Las Vegas was a nice change from the hustle and bustle. We got seated right away during peak breakfast time on a Wednesday morning. The menu was very organized into different sections, with a few options in each section. I have a belief that the smaller the menu, the better the food (usually) because they know what works and what doesn't, and there's less of a chance for you to order something that's just ""okay"". Anyway! I ordered the tofu scramble that came with chive potatoes, with a side of vegetable chili. My friends ordered the grilled cheese that came with tomato soup, and some egg dish (I forgot the name!).

My tofu scramble was very different from all the other tofu scrambles I've had in my time being vegan. I usually have it in little pieces so that it looks like..scrambled egg. Mine was in cubes. Very oily cubes. I wasn't a huge fan of the oil but the tofu wasn't too bad. The potatoes were very good. My chili was flavorful but too salty.  I accidentally had some tomato soup that had cheese in it (we had no idea), but that was one of the better tomato soups I've ever had. The grilled cheese was huge. For light eaters, I think that could've satisfied two people. The housemade chips were delicious as well (I think they had cheese in it, too?!). The egg dish was given a thumbs up from my friend. 

All the servers are very efficient at what they do, but do not sacrifice customer service while doing so. Many other places should take pointers from here.

I love the name of this place. I'm surprised that it hasn't been used yet!

My visit was on a Saturday late morning. Very hip downtown vibe, great for couples or friends to meet up for brunch after a late night.

Their menu focuses on supporting local farmers, making things in-house, and keeping it healthy. There are many unique items that are served here, Mediterranean egg white frittata, truffle egg sandwich, and shrimp & grits, which I'm always curious about. For lunch, what stood out was green chile chicken posole, salads, a Killer grilled cheese sandwich, even banh mi sandwiches! For dessert, shaved iced coffee. Interesting!

Our breakfast:

Steel-Cut Oats Cinnamon with roasted apples, cream and sugared pecans
Beignets with jam and vanilla-scented mascarpone
Golden-Brown Pancakes with chicken-apple sausage

How's the food? It tasted fresh and homemade. The pancakes were the star of this meal. AMAZING! Light, fluffy, and a little buttery crisp on the outside. My boyfriend and son shared the chicken-apple sausage and they loved it. We've had better oatmeal at other places and the beignets didn't have a light airy texture as I was hoping for. 

Service was friendly and efficient. They don't have booths, which we always try to grab to corner in my toddler and their tables were a bit small for the three of us. When we asked if we can use the next table to adjoin to ours, our server said sure, even though I know, being a server previously, that it meant she won't get that table seated. We felt bad and made sure we left a bigger tip to make up for it.

But as soon as we walked in, we were seated right then and there, which was convenient. I assume it was because we were a party of two. 

I ordered my food, (see photos!) and my boyfriend ordered his. Our food was okay. The service was okay. The food looked so good, but after eating it, it just felt.. greasy and heavy in my stomach. Not alot of healthier options in my opinion. And the bread that they add onto your plate... HUGE... Huge slices of sourdough bread, and 3-5 slices on your plate! I could hardly finish my bread, while my boyfriend didn't even touch his. 

The food portions are quite large, much more than we expected when we ordered. Had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered the cinnamon toast strawberry dessert, because even though we shared it, we still couldn't finish it. 

About $40.00 for brunch.. kind of pricey. Overall, my experience here was okay.. maybe in the near future I will try it again.",1,1,0

The staff was friendly yet they seemed like they can barely keep up with the customers. I asked our waitress for some recommendations but she didn't have much of an opinion other than the portions were large.

We got our food and we sat for a bit realizing they forgot to bring us our utensils. I ordered the cinnamon biscuit with the strawberry compote. My husband felt like having their ""killer grilled cheese"" with some ""kick-ass tomato soup."" My dish was decent but unremarkable except that I couldn't taste any cinnamon at all. I felt that I may have punted and should have ordered the chicken fried steak despite the waitress thinking the portions might be too large for me. I tried my husband's grilled cheese. Frankly, I make a far superior grilled cheese. The bread was too thick and it seemed more like a cheese sandwich with melted cheese. I could give this place another go since we might not have ordered the right items. But in my opinion, if a place is going to name their dish ""killer grilled cheese,"" they really need to back it up.",3,0,0

The wait is monstrous (even for a solo diner, due to rude fools hanging out at the bar when they're done) and they ""don't do takeout when they're busy"" so I couldn't just give them my money and leave. Food was good, but seemed like it wasn't their best effort.

Host was friendly and polite, despite being frazzled due to the crowd- a 10 minute estimate for my seat somehow turned into 40+ which was more time than I spent ordering, waiting for my food, eating, paying, and visiting another store, but I digress- with business this busy, they must be good, right?

Torn between the shrimp and grits or the truffled egg sando, I opted for the former and was only half-satisfied with my order, but by the time I got my food I was too hungry to complain. Grits were okay, bacon was crispy and added both flavor and texture, eggs were cooked perfectly, but shrimp were small and overcooked- should have been blackened, not precooked and tossed on like an afterthought. They lacked flavor and the pico was the most stand-out element of the dish, and there wasn't much of it.

I'm not generally a fan of community tables, though they're not much different than sitting at the bar- but I did make friends with the super-sweet couple who dined beside me. They ordered the egg sando and insisted I get it on my next visit. I'll eventually get around to coming back but it sure as hell won't be on a weekend.",10,7,5

Yes maybe a friend or two is running late, but to see the place empty full of open chairs, and still they won't seat you, now that's different service.

There's also this discomfort of eating when the owner just seats there and watch her servers do their job. She'll correct them discreetly but not so privately. I've seen owners help out by greeting you or seating you, but this one is different. She just seats in her throne.

Went for the Cinnamon Biscuits the next to last morning. Talked myself out of them because I was afraid they would be too much (many). Big Mistake\/Convenient excuse. Got the Truffled Scrambled Egg Sandwich- WHOA!! I was slightly disappointed in myself for ordering something so...""safe"". Heh, perfection is NOT safe. There was nothing in there that I couldn't\/haven't prepared before for myself BUT this was seriously delicious and well balanced. I like spicier food or interesting combinations but this sandwich was on point. I would have it again and wholeheartedly recommend it to less adventurous friends. HOWEVER, the hash browns....I spent pretty much each bite trying to determine why they were so good and how I can make mine as delicious. Not spicy like some places, but very flavorful. Soft but crispy, NOT greasy like so many others. Thick but cooked through and the few onions were perfectly cooked to coincidence. I'm not lying, I'm from the South and I've eaten and cooked hash browns my entire life but these really were that perfect and I almost feel like a dork going on about them! 
While contemplating my egg sandwich and hash browns, the couple next to me ordered and received the Cinnamon Biscuits. So not as intimidating. I was afraid they'd be huge- nope, normal size biscuits. Made a plan right then and there to return the next morning after checking out from my hotel. Quick note on the coffee- no fancy table presentation but just a good, well balanced cup of joe. Not strong but not bitter either. A really good coffee choice. I almost asked for a cup to go but thought I'd try a nearby coffee shop- Big Mistake!! Went to the other place, crap coffee and it was barely warm!!! Did not finish- should've taken it back but I was in such a contented state from my eat. experience I just dumped it.

Next day- Cinnamon Biscuit Day! Ran over from hotel. To spare the details- I ordered the biscuits minus the powdered sugar, with the compote on the side. I feared sugary overload for something which should stand alone. I also got a side Chicken Apple Sausage. Alone, the Cinnamon Biscuits are very, very good. Delicious in fact. I pride myself on my traditional Southern biscuits, which these are not, but a tasteful alternative. NOW, with the compote (as designed)-SLAP MY MAMA!! So, so, SO good and the flavors don't clash, they totally compliment if not reinforce. Fresh berries accompany. Great concept and execution. Even better than I expected! I can wholeheartedly recommend the Chicken Apple Sausage, also. Split and grilled, not greasy and went great with the sweet of the biscuits. Learning from yesterday's mistake, I asked for a to go cup for the awesome coffee. 

Two times service, both early morning before the crowds- exceptional- especially for Vegas. Seated quickly, someone at my table moments after seating for my drink order, quick turn and back with recommendations and helpful advice for my food order. Food turnaround both days was super quick. For a town known for ambivalent service at best, this place gets it. I was recognized the second day and thanked for returning. So nice to be appreciated as a customer.

I don't make the rules. I was holding a full ice coffee, with a lid. I like to get my ice coffee before a restaurant in case they only have hot coffee, which I cannot drink. So I tossed it and was so very unhappy at that moment. The two guys were not even nice about it, never said hi, welcome. One of the guys was my waiter, he never introduced himself, just wanted to know what I wanted. A lady walks in after me with a water, they said nothing to her about her drink. I really wanted to not leave a tip, but I will never do that, so I am leaving this review. I won't be back!

I had the DWBLTA sandwich (smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo on sour dough bread) with the tomato soup. The sandwich was fantastic... everything was fresh and the sourdough bread was perfect. The tomato soup was seriously the best I have ever had! If you go to EAT definitely try the tomato soup!

Eat. is located in the trendy side of downtown right behind container park and at the edge of the action at life is beautiful. Parking is street parking and luckily we were able to get a spot close to Eat. We had to pay like $2 for parking and convenience but the machines to pay are all new and very easy to use.  When we went inside there were a good amount of people but it wasn't packed and we were still able to find a seat. I'd imagine on weekends there would definitely be a wait. 

Service: Our server was friendly and offered\/provided help when needed. Kept up with our waters and did her due diligence. The chef or owner? I'm not sure also came by to check on us and other tables which was a nice touch. Very laid back but prompt and knowledgable, which is perfect for a place like this. 

Entrees: Killer Grilled Cheese x Roast Beef Sandwich. Both came with sides and my girlfriend chose tomato soup for her grilled cheese and I got chips for my sandwich. When I first looked through the menu I wasn't expecting much. I found the menu to be quite boring and dull as everything sounded so basic, but I was quickly proven wrong. The ciabatta bread was extremely soft and the sandwich was pleasantly warm and not cold. The combination of the roast beef, wild mushroom, mayo, and definitely the arugula provided a nice mixture of flavor and the crunch of the arugula made it just the more satisfying. The Grilled Cheese is very hearty and reminiscent of an english breakfast. Very buttery and tasted like a mix of brioche and french toast. This was also a pleasant surprise as I did not expect the grilled cheese to be like this. Fun to dip with the tomato soup but I'm not a big soup person so I wasn't too blown away. Tomato soup was simple as was the side of chips although the chips were a little too salty for my taste. 

Extras: Stack of Pancakes: Ordered a stack of pancakes due to popular reviews as well as thinking that I wouldn't be as full from the sandwich. Not a pancake expert but it's definitely better than the normal ihop pancakes. Butter and Syrup is provided on the side and the exterior is crusted just right. Not too thick either which I like as I feel like pancakes can get real dry, real fast. Thankfully these didn't and I enjoyed it as did my girlfriend. 

Thoughts: This is a fun little restaurant downtown as part of the trendy hipster revolution that's swept over this side of the city. Walking around and seeing the area definitely reminded me of places like Seattle, Portland, and Downtown La.  The design of the restaurant too with it's black\/ white colors, natural sunlight, open kitchen, exposed bricks, and thrifty furniture. It's like  the neighborhood spot down the street that main character in romcoms go to for a bite to eat. Food is simple, clean, and delicious. Portions are generous, and it's a perfect place for breakfast or a quick lunch. I'm a big fan of this side of town as change is sweeping and I can definitely see a shift in culture. It's exciting to see the growth and change of this area from being the ""ghetto"" or ""old"" to the ""new"" and trendy side of town.",0,0,0

I fell in love with this place. The food. The service. The ambiance. Even the location was perfect. 
It's away from the Vegas strip which can be a bit too loud for one to enjoy a nice meal but at the same time its so close to Fremont St that has a lot to offer. The restaurant is located exactly across from the back of the Container Park, which by the way everyone should go to. 

The wait time here is tricky, it depends at what time you show up. But don't be taken back by the amount of people waiting, every second you wait will be worth it once you go in and eat. 

The menu is very basic, but everything sounds great and if you are like me you will find yourself looking at other table sot see what people ordered. So everywhere I turned everything looked amazingly good. For appetizer, we had some biscuits with strawberry sauce drizzled with confectionery sugar....TO DIE FOR. As soon as we took a bite of the biscuit we knew that we were in for a good eat. 
For main course i went for the pancakes with an apple sausage and my brother and mom went for the breaded steak, yes STEAK. When they ordered they missed the part that said steak so when they went in for the cut they say that it was not a fried chicken breast, it was steak. And holy moly was that a big piece of steak. Both of them could of ate from one plate. The steak came with two eggs and potatoes. As to my pancakes, it was a simple dish, but boy were those pancakes huge.  They gave me three I only ate one and a half. I couldn't do it. And let's just say that for the price I did not mind not being able to finish it all.",1,0,0

We've seen their brunch and lunch menu but living way in Henderson (so far away! lol) we hadn't made it out before dinner time.

Hubby tried the shrimp po boy which had a banh mi kick to it! It was very fresh and delicious. We sampled their deviled eggs which were deep fried with sriracha on top -- I have to say they were the best deviled eggs I've ever had! 

Hubby had their passion tea and I had the sparkling strawberry lemonade which was pretty amazing.

I had to put in the earplugs I always have with me.  My chicken pot pie used puff pastry underneath and on top of the filling.  The filling was okay; I didn't detect a lot of chicken in it, but it wasn't all sauce like some--mostly veggies I think.  The bottom crust couldn't be crispy, and the top crust wasn't either--so I just ate arouond the edges.

Hubby read about it in the Sunset Magazine and I questioned, ""What does Sunset Mag know?""  Well, was I wrong.  It's in Downtown where the street has posted ""Neighborhood Watch"", so you know it's not a great place to be at night.  The place is clean, bright and modern looking, located approximately 2 miles from the Strip.
The food:
1. Beignets, $8 for a place of 6 rectangles, 2-3 inches.  Very good, like donuts but NOT as good as Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.  Came with jam and a ""to die for"" cinnamon butter.
2. Chicken fried steak, $13.  Hubby says it's definitely homemade because the shape was irregular.  I had a bite, good.  But we both agreed we like the CFS better at the Pork Store Cafe in SF. Came with potato chunks.
3. Shrimp and Grits, $12.  I loved this dish.  Layers on the bottom of my dish was creamy, soft grits, topped with a tortilla, bacon strips and the shrimp sauce with large pieces of shrimp.  It was more than enough for 1 person but I stuffed myself and ate the whole thing so as not to waste any.  Milk, $2 and OJ $4.

My girlfriend and I really wanted to try out this place as it has been on our Instagram newsfeeds for the last month or so. I couldn't take the heckling I received via social media and thus forced myself into the oblivion... and shawty was I not disappointed. 

As a ""Yelper"" I'm going to do my best to not throw around the holy ""5 Stars"" unless it is deserved. This place deserved it. Location wise, it isn't the most convenient but good food is always worth the the drive and in this case, area wise, worth the risk. I may be over exaggerating but it isn't the nicest part of town, but I'll be honest and say I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. I assume you usually would have to pay for parking as there are meters everywhere, coming here on a Sunday we so graciously avoided that. So firstly, come on a Sunday. 

We walk in and you just feel the vibe. It's like, ""who cares that you're here just eat!"" kinda vibe. The wait was minimal at least and the spot is decently sized for a downtown restaurant. We were sat down and greeted almost immediately. The service was on point, one of those places that you're kind of taken back by how friendly everyone is. 

The food. Ah yes the food. We both ordered some generous cups of coffee to get us started, good coffee can make a place. We decided to try their beignets, which were accompanied by a side of this berry-concoction jam and this sweet frosting butter mix, if you will. I've had beignets before, I lived in New Orleans for a little and was spoiled by the Cafe du Monde's of the gulf. These were delicious. A fresh take on a French classic, well worth it. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which was delicious and was sided with some grilled potatoes and onions. I ordered the Downtown Benedict which had turkey bacon and fresh as can be spinach and tomatoes accompanied with just the right amount of hollandaise on top. Mine was sided with those scrumptious potatoes and onions as well. The portions were extremely generous for the price, I was stuffed. The food was amazing and I can't complain about anything. 

The vibe was great there, the music playing ahead was perfect. From John Mayer to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole soothing our ears. But before we could get to attached, a local artist named Sabrielle (someone please message me if they can correct me on this or where I can purchase her music) performed live. Her voice was amazing and kind of sold it for us. Apparently she's there every other Sunday so if you're lucky enough, she's gonna be famous one day.

Anyone reading this seeing 3 stars and thinking it's a bad review, it's not! But there were several issues during our meal that made this place miss the 4 star level.

One place they excel: the pancake. It's thick and fluffy, while still being crispy on the outside. I rarely order pancakes, but after two bites, I was hooked.  The homemade tomato soup was quite good, with large, thin chunks or parmesan floating on top. Also, the coffee served here is excellent.

We also tried the truffled egg sandwich. I've seen other reviewers rave about this, but something was missing. The bread wasn't good, and the flavors of the ingredients didn't meld well together. 

The service here was lacking.  It seems to be focused on turnover rather than true customer interaction. Our server asked us about five times if we were ready to order.  Once we were finished, three different people asked if we wanted the check.  We weren't checked on a single time while dining. 

Lastly, the name is kind of dumb:
""Hey, you want to go eat?"" 
""Sure, what are you thinking?""
""How about eat?""
""....I know, like, what place""
""No...the restaurant in downtown called eat, silly""
""...""

I had looked at the menu online, and I had practically decided what I would have before going, but I looked at the menu in any case.Coffee was brought quickly while I was looking at the menu and reaffirming my decision.  I had to go with the Huevos Motulenos.

What an interesting breakfast!  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, peas, sautéed bananas, and feta cheese with two over easy eggs on top and then topped with red and green chili sauce.  The dish comes with home fried potatoes.  Since this is a breakfast and lunch restaurant only, these home fries are made from scratch. These aren't cubed potatoes left over from last night's baked potatoes.  I watched as the one cook cut the potatoes and then stirred them as they grilled.

The menu states that this is a zesty dish.  It was excellent!  I could have used a little Cholula, but I decided to have it as it was served than eat breakfast with lots of hot sauce like I'm known to do.  Service was very good.

I like this small new place--open only 2 months--and it does have a ""loft"" kind of vibe like another reviewer stated.  My only complaint is parking over which Eat has no control.

After being sat we were immediately greeted and offered recommendations. My wife doesn't drink black coffee and after being convinced by our server she ordered it. She loved it and also bought a bag of the coffee beans. A little pricey at $15 but it is great to support a local business. We started with an order of beignets. They were absolutely amazing. Light, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Served along side a strawberry preserve and flavored cream cheese. It was delicious together and by itself. A definite must have. I ordered the chicken fried steak and a side pancake (another recommendation by our server). The steak was filled with gristle and hard to cut and chew. This took away from my enjoyment of the dish. The batter was light and crispy. The big plus was the gravy, absolutely delicious. Creamy with chunks of sausage, perfectly balanced, not overly creamy it oily. They claimed to have the best pancake. It was served with pure maple syrup. It looked like it was cooked in a cast iron skillet. It had crispy edges and a fluffy center. It was an absolutely perfect pancake.

We were taken here by a LV local, but I dunno if it's really a ""local"" place.

I got the eggs benedict, and wow, I don't know if it's because I was nearing the end of my road trip from San diego to Denver and back again and was eating subway\/in&out everyday, but that Benedict just made my DAY. ShOOt. The benedict was topped with a perfect little egg - poached to perfection - covered with hollandaise, under which lay strips of thick turkey bacon, swiss or thick cheese of some sort, tomato, greens, and a nicely toasted piece of bread. The egg had a GREAT ooze to it as you slowly cut into the center of the yoke, adding to the taste and texture. The bacon was so thick i had to chew slower than I wanted to. On the side was a heaping of potatoes, seasoned well. 

Definitely a great change from huge and not very good portions served at quick joints on the strip, but super filling! Friends got shrimp and grits, pancakes, country fried steak, all of which no one complained about. I'd come back again!!!",0,0,0

My friend Ms. W and Mr. P both got the Pancakes. It was a much better portion for the price compared to my dish. And the Pancakes were very nicely done. I particularly appreciated the little jars of  real maple syrup they came with. But getting plain and simple pancakes just isn't my thing - I need them full of granola, smothered in Nutella and topped with strawberries because I'm that kind of crazy girl. 

The best, most special thing I had was definitely the deviled Eggs. They were panko-encrusted and fried, then topped with bacon. Now we're talking!

Maybe I should've tried their cinnamon biscuits topped with strawberries. It seems to be one of their most popular dishes and based on the Pancakes and the amazing bread the provide to go with just about every plate, they do Grain-based dishes best.",18,6,9

Service was good and the staff was friendly, but one thing I noticed was that the cooks pre-prepare a lot of their food, probably in anticipation for the crowds? I saw stacks of pre-cooked bacon, potatoes, biscuits, etc., which leads me to believe that the food isn't as freshly made as you would think. Maybe this is the norm everywhere, but I just happened to notice that here.

For starters - the service is not there. Neither our hostess nor our waiter were particularly warm or accommodating. Our table didn't have any silverware - not even after our coffees were served. We instead had to ask for them as our food was coming out. We noticed this happened with a bunch of other tables as well. The waiter just couldn't be bothered to do anything beyond the bare minimum necessary. 

As for the food - the food was decent. The truffled egg sandwich that everyone raves about was a-ok for an egg sandwich in my book (a $12 egg sandwich btw). I was most excited about the mushrooms and truffle flavors - but it was disappointingly light on the mushrooms and the truffles. I maybe caught only one bite that had a hint of truffles. The sandwich also comes on a giant toasted ciabbata roll that wasn't sliced - a minor detail, but those details adds up. 

The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was decent - the biscuit is more like a toasted chunk of cinnamon bread. Not particularly buttery or hard on the outside like a true biscuit. The strawberry compote was good - it came with some fresh strawberries and blackberries. Another minor detail- but the leaves weren't removed from the strawberries. The color of the tiny leaves didn't add anything aesthetically - and needing to remove them just became a bit of a pain in the butt.

A place that has given Rex the best experiences that resulted in crabs, losing a kidney, or being beaten mercilessly by a midget pimp holding an oversized bust of Gabe Kaplan.  Oh, the memories.  As much as Rex looks back on those fondly, he is excited about the changes taking place Downtown.  Gone are some of the crack houses, crack ho's and crack...now is some crack mixed with good places to eat and sleep.  One great place to eat...is eat. ""eat.""  Terrible bad name that is not clever or interesting, but please don't let that misstep deter you from going forth and trying this wonderful little place. (Going forth? Last time I huff paint and read Chaucer...but in all fairness...it is the only way to read Chaucer.)  

Eat. Is a revelation.  It is a wonderful little breakfast\/lunch spot.  If you can forgive that hipster, desperately trying to be Seattle or if not Seattle, Portland...and if not Portland...a good attempt at Portland in Dayton Ohio...then yes...it is very, very good.  Rex, like all thinking humans, hates hipsters and hipster culture. So at first when you see the tattoos and the trying too hard without looking like trying too hard hipness of the place you want to vomit wildly while gurgling ""You are our disco!!""  Please refrain. They mean you no harm. They are just misguided. Also, the food is damn good. So, Rex has eaten several times and will eat there again...but just for breakfast. Breakfast is way better than their lunch menu.

Stars of the breakfast...first and foremost one of the most interesting and delightful dishes of all time (yes, Rex punched himself in the balls for typing delightful), is the huevos motulenos. Odd collection of things that should not work but do...very, very well.  The second best was the shrimp and grits. Might be the best grits in Las Vegas. The pancakes are excellent and the chicken fried steak is the size of a bread plate and wonderfully tender and crispy.  The oatmeal was not great, I would not recommend.

Lunch was good, but not great. The salads seem out of place and Rex has heard more than one person say they are just ""okay"". Lose them. This isn't a salad place. The grilled cheese was not ""killer"" except if you mean it killed my belief it was a great grilled cheese. The version of the blt was good, but nothing exceptional. The Rueben was good, but nothing to write home about.  

One last thing...Rex wanted coffee one morning...the coffee maker was broken! Travesty that must be avoided. He heard some dumb bastard try to order ginger ale with breakfast and he wanted to hit that guy in the face with his decent orange juice glass.  He didn't Rex IS a renaissance man...which is why his ho's always walk the cobblestone streets and bring back ducats from their ""dates.",5,9,5

The hostess who greeted us at the front was very rude and we almost left because of her bad attitude. But we decided to stick it out since we were excited to try the food. 

Luckily, after we were seated, we were assisted by different employees and our visit picked up. We ordered the pancakes with chicken apple sausage, egg Benedict daily special, and an avocado BLT. Hubby was not impressed with the Benedict and my friend complained that the bread used for the BLT was too thick and overwhelmed the sandwich. I thought the pancakes were really good.

The atmosphere is on point where it's laid out well and you're able to have a conversation with whoever you're eating with whether it's inside or outside. 
Now, if you're wondering why this place only gets a 4 and not a 5, it's because this place in my eyes can only be considered a breakfast place and not a brunch restaurant. The big distinction is that brunch requires alcohol and they don't serve that here. That in itself is literally the one thing that is wrong with this place.

I love this place and I love that it's located downtown.  Finally, a great brunch and lunch spot in the 89101.  Finally, a neighborhood place not catering to Southern California tourists.  It's awesome.  It's friendly.  And it's become so well-known that it can be tough to get a seat.  

The lunch menu is solid--great sandwiches and salads. The grilled cheese is excellent with thick Texas toast style bread and sharp cheddar.  Simple and awesome.  Nice fresh tomato salad on the side.  The roast beef sandwich is also tasty.  Fresh and thin roast beef with bright blue cheese on perfect bread.

For brunch, there's a lot of excellent options and some that just miss the mark.  The eggs benedict is delicious.  The chicken fried steak was decent, but not brilliant--more of a kitschy choice but not particularly well done.  The main disappointment is 
the huevos rancheros dish.  It's an awkward attempt at culinary creativity with peas and sautéed bananas mixed into the savoriness of eggs and rancheros sauce.

This place has an excellent, inviting atmosphere. In a downtown focused on daytime business and nighttime drinking, it's a nice spot for the locals.  A spot to meet and spend time connecting with people.  And there's a charming porch to sit on when it's not baking hot outside.

If there's a main setback, it's that Eat can't handle the lunch rush that happens Mon-Fri.  There's so few great food options in downtown Vegas that Eat is crowded every day.  If you're coming for lunch, prepare to wait.  And try to keep the number of your party to 2 people.  The hostesses have a hard time figuring out how to seat parties larger than 2 in an efficient way.  Know this going in and you'll have a great time.

Bottom line: 4.5 stars for the excellent atmosphere, friendly service, and generally solid menu.  Minus one star for occasionally cranky customer service, long waits at lunch, and some mediocre dishes.",3,1,1

Across from the new container park, eat. is a casual spot to grab some solid lunch and breakfast fare. I'm a sandwich first, ask questions later kind of guy, so I've yet to test out the breakfast, but everything I've had on the lunch side of things has been excellent. The free range chicken sandwich is served on a light, crunchy ciabatta with a juicy chicken breast and fresh toppings. The reuben is large and the best I've had in Vegas, the veggie burger is made on-site and the passion fruit iced tea is unsweetened, so it just has a hint of tropical flavor in it. Sold? I thought so. See ya there.

The the homemade jam and vanilla marscapone that came with the beignets were excellent. The outer bite and inner fluffiness was just right, but the flavor a little off. The eggs were cooked really nice and creamy, the potatoes nicely caramelized and the bacon crispy. She liked a lot. But thought it was weird that everything had the same seasoning.

We sat. At the bar so we could get a seat without wait and see them cook. I don't eat meat, so this is always fun to see how vegetarian-friendly a place is. Eat does not claim to be and they are not. The beignets were cooked with the chicken-fried chicken. That's where the off-flavor came from. Who cooks sweet and savory together? We watched as potatoes and pancakes were cooked in the bacon grease, making those not vegetarian options. It was also weird that the chicken-fried chicken was pre-cooked. They pull a Saran wrapped cooked cutlet from the fridge and drop in in the oil to twice-cook it. Maybe that's their thing, but people loved it. We also watched as almost everything sent out got a got couple shakes of some salt seasoning. I tried a taste of the eggs and the seasoning was good, just my gf didn't think it needed to be on everything.

We were seated immediately and our waitress came right over.  Two cups of coffee, great cups, good coffee.  We opted for one pancake to share and it was big, but nothing special.  More like Denny's than even homemade.

We also split their deviled egg appetizer.  The take eggs, remove the yolk, coat the whites in panko breadcrumbs and fry them.  They're not served warm, so that part is ok,  then they make the yellow part deviled and top it with Sriracha sauce, bacon (which we omitted due to hubby being a pescatarian) and maybe green onions.  Very interesting from a texture standpoint, but nothing amazing in the taste zone.  Four halves = $8....too high.

We each ordered the Killer Grilled Cheese, which is billed as aged cheddar on sourdough, served with kick-ass tomato soup.  The bread was thicker than Texas toast, with a nice crispy buttery browned crust.  There was this almost translucent slice of cheddar cheese which had no discernsble flavor due to the overwhelming presence of the bread.  The tomato soup had a hint of basil, a super runny base and a few chunks of tomatoes.  It was served in a beautiful large bowl and if it was a scant cup, if that.  The duo was certainly not worth the $9 price tag.

All in all, two coffees, two grilled cheese and soup, one pancake and two deviled eggs was almost $50!

I came here on a Sunday morning during normal busy brunching hours. I get it, it's a popular time to eat, but I what I don't get is waiting 25 minutes to seated then having to wait another 10 minutes before we even get to meet out server for the morning. Thirty five minutes in total waiting and all I have received is a cup of water and some coffee. Personally, I would avoid Eat. on Sundays for brunch, because this place gets packed!

I suggested this place to some friends and family after reading a few Eat's reviews, for the most part they have good reviews with a few minor hiccups along the way. We arrived and after studying the menu for the past half hour we were finally able to sit down. The hostess took us to our table and almost immediately we were greeted with waters and a notification that out server would be right back to help us... fast forward to us looking at the menu for the 7th time and wondering when\/if our bellies would ever get full on this beautiful Sunday morning, out of nowhere our server finally appears pen and paper in hand. After a few quick menu questions and our table having to explain to our server what a Frittata is, our food order was put in and breakfast was on it's way. 

FOOD TIME:
As a group we ordered the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. These were ok, the cinnamon flavor was lacking and the biscuit fell apart at every turn, but the compote was quite delicious and I found myself going back for more.  
 
I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. First off this had a beautiful presentation, the way the food was laid on the plate was fantastic and really made me want to dive right in. This order comes with two huge bacon strips, two over medium eggs, two fairly large butterflied shrimp, all placed on a mound of grits. This meal was ok, it had good flavor, but needed a just a kick of spice on the back end. Also it arrived cold. Which I thought was weird because I was the last person at our table to get my food. 

During our meal a few things were definitely noted... 

- Our server was M.I.A., we didn't see her again until the check was dropped. 
- The server or food runner forgot to bring out one of our diners toast. Since our server had disappeared. We asked the hostess for assistance and she quickly delivered the toast. 
- Our table was also lacking condiments; ketchup, salsa, and tabasco. After a few attempts get to someone's attention, my GF's mom got up and went into the kitchen and asked for the missing items herself. 
- Our waters were filled only once the entire time we ate. I'm not looking for a running river here, but a refresher of the water glasses would be nice. 

I really wanted to like this place. It has a great ambiance and decor, but when the food and the customer service are not a in fully symbiotic relationship other things tend to follow suit. 

EAT. is NOT A-Ok, but just ok. I believe in second chances so I will be back, but I will be avoiding the Sunday brunch crowd.",16,7,10

The two issues I have are the restaurant space and the service.  The restaurant is a hip, urban eatery with the requisite black ceiling, hewn wood, and minimalist booths paired with vintage looking chairs.  Nice.  But it's loud.  It has a show kitchen where you can see the staff work, and the sounds coming out are to be expected. Since there are all hard surfaces (ceiling, cement floor) the sound carries, but again, that's ok.  What made it uncomfortable was the music which added to the din. We were there at opening time on Sunday morning, and the music was turned up to industrial levels. It was difficult to talk to my husband, and I missed a few things the server said. I just wish the volume was a little lower.
The other issue is the service.  Our server was reasonably polite, and that's good, but there were just too many workers there at that time without enough to do, so they wouldn't give us time to enjoy our breakfast.  Our server checked back right away to see how we were doing, which I appreciate, but what really bothered me is that the check was plopped down on our table before we were half done with our meals.  She said 'No rush', but it sure felt like it. There were only four other occupied tables in the place, and no line waiting for a seat.  Three other servers refilled our coffee and water enough, but each time asked us if we wanted to-go boxes and tried to clear our plates before we were half done. I noticed it happening at another table as well.  Whatever you do, don't put down your fork and stop to savor your food because someone will  attempt to take it away from you regardless of how much is left on your plate. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to enjoy my breakfast, but the noise and the servers gave a sense of urgency to get out of there. If we had been there for an hour and was taking a table away from other people waiting, I would understand, but we weren't. We spent $48 (including tip) on breakfast for two, and were only there for about 45 minutes which included being seated, looking at the menu, ordering, eating, and drinking coffee. This isn't supposed to be a fast food joint. We might come back for the deviled eggs, but I doubt it.",0,0,0

The food was ok but nothing really stood out to make me want to return. I shared the B.L.A.T. and the Shrimp Po Boy with the other adult we were dining with. Both came with a side of potato salad. When I think of a Po Boy I imagine a subroll bursting with fried shrimp shredded lettuce and tomato finished with delicious aioli. This ""Po Boy"" was on a ciabatta with sauteed shrimp, lettuce, tomato, bread and butter pickles and sriracha mayo. It was fine but I'll be heading over to Lola's soon to satisfy my Po Boy craving.
The B.L.A.T. was good. 
The best thing on the all of the plates was the pickle. It was a great pickle. 
The boys had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The sandwiches were good but the soup was not good at all. It was so overwhelmed by garlic that I can still taste it now, hours after I had just a few bites. That brings me to my main complaint. They don't accommodate kids in any way. The drinks for the two four year olds were served in 16oz glass pint glasses, There is no kids menu and there's really not much on the lunch menu that kids would like except the grilled cheese and I've already talked about the soup that's served with it. My son isn't picky but he's also not adventurous either. He's a normal 4 year old.
Perhaps I might return for breakfast but I think there are better choices in the area for lunch.

I love the free range chicken sandwich and the Caesar chicken salad. the deep fried panko crusted deviled eggs with Apple smoked bacon and a touch of sriracha are to die for. it's an orgy in your mouth with a happy ending and well worth the money. Corned beef hash and eggs it's delicious, pancakes delicious, truffle egg sandwich delicious even the grilled cheese with basil tomato soup is delicious . So far everything I have eaten there has been delicious. 

Natalie the chef and owner has brought a great burst of sunshine to the downtown area with her fresh twists on traditional American breakfast and lunch. I hear she's going to open a fried chicken spot can't wait to taste that.

If you're going to go try to go early it gets kinda busy around lunch time. A nice touch is they have some counter seating for single person or a cool community table if you like conversation. weekends are really busy so I usually go on the weekdays. The staff is pretty awesome and all very friendly. The line chef runs a very well oiled machine of a kitchen.

First and foremost, if you come on a weekend make sure you allow yourself an extra 20 minutes before you know you'll be hungry. There was only two of us but we were seated within 20 minutes. 

The atmosphere is kind of loud so if you're looking for a quite place to relax and have a bite while reading the paper, this isn't the place for you.

The menu is very minimalistic with 5-6 options in the sweet category and the savory category. I went with the truffle egg sandwich. Pretty darn good. The ciabatta was fresh and the smoked bacon that's inside the sandwich was nice and crispy. Potatoes were decent. Not oily and cooked throughout. I should've asked if I could of substituted the potatoes. If you're a homestyle potato person this is totally for you.

Our server Gary was pretty helpful. We told him what we were kind of craving and he pointed us in the right direction. He was very attentive and other servers in the restaurant were very helpful as well.

Located on the 1st floor of an apartment building at the corner of Carson St. & 7th St., ""eat."" is a casual & trendy restaurant known for its upscale American breakfast\/lunch entrees w\/ southern & New Mexican touches, while using quality & locally sourced products. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=sloCm07roLTYRRVg5PHCJQ 

During a recent Vegas trip during Spring break, my son & I had our 1st meal in Vegas - breakfast at eat. on a weekday mid-morning.  Our entrees were delicious, & the presentations were eye-catching. We had the following:

- Golden-brown pancakes w\/ chicken-apple sausage ($9). This order came w\/ thick pancakes w\/ a grilled chicken-apple sausage sliced down the middle & garnished w\/ powdered sugar & a strawberry sliced in half. The pancakes, crispy at the edges & so fluffy & soft on the inside, were perfectly done.  They were so delicious & were the best that I've tasted! They came w\/ butter & cute little sealed jars of 100% maple syrup from Vermont, instead of the sticky tabletop syrup dispensers; the pancakes were so flavorful that you really didn't need to use that much syrup. The entrée is so generous that I could not finish it; next time, I'll just have a side order of one pancake to satisfy my craving & try another entrée. The full order would have been good to share amongst a group of people. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=d371vDGyCTtrV47Wfezxig 

- DWBLTA w\/ fresh made-from-scratch tomato soup & pickle ($11). This sandwich is their version of a BLT consisting of smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado w\/ chipotle mayo on buttery toasted sourdough.  (DW stands for Don Welch, who is one of the restaurant's investors.) I was impressed w\/ the thick slices of smoked bacon & avocado, which made the sandwich very creamy & savory; the ingredients complemented each other very well. The tomato soup was very flavorful.  This entrée is a winner! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=KfcNl_Zk82sijLfZcCy5Rw 

We chose the above two entrees based on the resounding comments posted in other Yelp reviews. They also have other popular dishes which we will try  the next time:  chicken fried steak, shrimp & grits, beignets, huevos motulenos, eggs done in different ways, salads, many types of sandwiches (roast beef, chicken, grilled cheese, veggie burger, Rueben, shrimp), & freshly made chips. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=HaumAEuf9JqmIJP_lQej4g http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=epkj9L81E8G3DUDyjjNq5A http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xKU896f0iS1uFBqYkSFEgg 

Service was very attentive, as the servers, in their signature black attire, ensured that our orders came quickly, dirty dishes taken away promptly, water glasses refilled regularly,& periodic checking in assuring that everything was okay. In fact, I found out afterwards that chef\/owner Natalie Young will appear in the dining room & converse w\/ diners to get feedback in improving her operation (I don't recall if she did talk to us, as I didn't know who she was at that time.)

The restaurant seats about 60 people. The interior is full of charm w\/ a mixture of brick & green walls & a cemented floor. The walls are adorned w\/ artwork of local artists.  There are orange metal chairs made from recycled materials, partial booths of a green color, tables, & a bar counter facing an open kitchen. Fabric napkins are used. Cute recyclable boxes are used for doggie bags. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=zsaULVQQOqXcBg4WOb7eBA http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=4Pp0OeG2PEltnI1XhuvK-Q http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=1XAw57xgR3526XmFH1h4Tw 

Opened in Sept. 2012, eat. was the first restaurant to be part of the Downtown Revitalization Project in luring businesses to be part of the permanent venture. Its chef & owner, Natalie Young, was tapped for this restaurant; she had 12 years of previous experience at restaurants on the Strip, such as Hard Rock Café, MGM Grand, & Paris LAS. She named the restaurant ""eat."" to describe a place where locals can come, eat, & talk\/enjoy one another. In its first 34 days of opening, the restaurant served 2,300 customers!

Metered curbside parking available.  No reservations taken. We did not have a problem in finding a parking space, nor did we have to wait to be seated, probably because it was midmorning on a weekday; we heard that there are lines on weekends.

To start, parking is a little limited since it's on the corner of Carson and 7th. This isn't a complaint (not the restaurant's fault) so much as it is a warning; be sure to bring change for a meter.

The restaurant has a nice, friendly atmosphere, described as ""retro-chic"" in an article I read about it when it first opened up.That's a pretty good description. I'm not any kind of interior design expert (which is why I stole the term from some local magazine article), so I'll just leave the decor at that. I should probably add that ""retro-chic"" apparently doesn't reach for any overt style associated with a specific decade. In other words, this place isn't art-deco or mod or anything like that; it's as comfortable and down-home as it should be, which is good! It's a small joint but it wasn't totally packed when we came in.  I think we just missed the breakfast crowd though, it began filling up again while we ate.

With that out of the way: the coffee, to paraphrase Dale Cooper, is damn good. It is good enough to drink as black as midnight on a moonless night. We all (unless you're one of those weirdos that don't like coffee) know that this is important for any breakfast\/lunch spot. The food itself is also delicious.

On my first visit: we started with beignets to share for the group. They come with a delicious vanilla mascarpone and equally delicious jam.  I'd recommend spreading both on your beignet, it's like your mouth dies and goes to heaven! The beignets are fluffy, light pastries, and, just as they should be, made to order. You won't regret getting them.

I had their benedict on my first visit, since we were there in time for breakfast. In short, it was freaking awesome; so good, in fact, that I couldn't stop myself from using hyperbole in my description of it. The hollandaise sauce had just the right amount of tang; the spinach and tomato tasted fresh; the eggs were perfect; and the turkey bacon had just the right amount of crispness. I also had their pancakes which are light and fluffy, just as a pancake should be. I don't eat pancakes very often so I'm probably not a good judge, but these were very satisfying. If I was feeling more adventurous that day, I would have gotten the huevos motulenos, but that's why I plan on coming for breakfast again

On my second visit, I had their free-range chicken sandwich since it was lunch time.  It comes on ciabatta bread served with greens, mozzarella and pesto spread. Again, the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful, but the pesto really made the sandwich. It's a good light meal, and the home made potato chips that came with it are something special. I'd recommend coming to lunch early if you're interested in the pot pie - my friend was going to get it but we were told they only make a limited amount per day so she had to order something else. 

My main complaint is that the service I've received on both visits was ""okay"" at best, but not at all anything to write home about.",3,0,1

What we didn't like was the slow, unfriendly service: We came about 10 am on a Sunday morning and were quoted 25 minutes for a table of 3.

I was really worried the wait would be super long from the other color runners, we were told it would be half an hour, but it only ended up being 15 minutes. I already knew I wanted the chicken fried steak since it had good reviews and looked delicious from the pictures on here. I also ordered passion tea, which was okay I wish I would of ordered the strawberry drink instead. I was very pleased with the chicken fried steak, the breading was well seasoned and it was a huge piece, a sharable portion. The gravy and seasoned potatoes went with it pretty well too. I ordered the house made chips instead of eggs and I was really disappointed because they look good in the pictures but didn't have the texture I was hoping for. I also had the English muffin as my side, which was nothing spectacular. My 2 other friends both ordered the chilaquiles scrambled eggs, they were both kinda whatever about it because they didn't expect it to be vegetarian.

We were, luckily, seated right before it started to get busy (around 12\/ 1 p.m.) & we ordered a few diff things - Deviled Eggs on special, the Truffled Egg Sandwich, Reuben, & 2 orders of the Tofu Scramble... Everyone was happy with their food (including me), but I did find my entire Tofu Scramble dish unnecessarily covered in oil; But I tried hard to look past that since there was such a good dish underneath. As if it didn't already sound good enough, it tasted even better! I loved the mushrooms & sprouts, & even thought the thick-cut wheat toast was noteworthy - Everything just really worked! The recipe itself is a great one & I would order this over & over again
While the service started off good, with the workers carrying drinks & explaining the specials right away, it unfortunately depleted throughout our meal & I wasn't much of a fan by the time we left
Some workers were okay but our actual waitress neglected us the entire time we were there, failed to check on us even once, & completely ignored a question\/ concern we had about the food & did nothing to help us fix the problem we addressed. Even though it wasn't a big deal, I feel she could have done a much better job esp. after seeing someone else quickly resolve our issue for us, when they weren't even the one that was supposed to be waiting on our table. I also have to say that I hate when people put the bill down on the table MINUTES after we've just received food, but I suppose this was her way of saying that she was done with our table & no longer planned to do much else for us... As this was clearly indicative of her service thereafter. She hardly even deserved a tip since she did next to nothing, but we tried to be nice
Anyway, I am only giving this place 5 stars for the food & environment, not the service

The orange juice was clearly freshly squeezed and balanced sweetness with citrus perfectly.

The Applewood smoked bacon was deliciously meaty and fresh from the pan.

The coffee was exactly what breakfast coffee should be; strong and tasty without any annoying acidity, but not with a flavor that overshadows the rest of the meal.

The pancakes were delicious and filling without being too heavy. The sausage on top and dusting of powdered sugar were a nice touch.

First of all, let's start with the location and restaurant.  Located in the downtown area and within walking distance from the Fremont Experience.  For someone that is not familiar with the area, it can easily be missed since it's literally below some apartments.  Just remember that it's at the corner of Carson & 7th.  The outside and inside brings me back home.  This establishment reminds me of the historic North Park area of San Diego where restaurants, cafes, and stores sit below apartments.  

I met fellow Yelper Terri R for breakfast and we were both ready to chow down.  The menu is as simple as it gets.  No folding laminated menu, just a one page sheet.  Everything looked good, but I decided on the Smoked Salmon. Yes, fish for breakfast.  Besides, I was going to have eggs for lunch. 

The Smoked Salmon is served with tomatoes, cream cheese, and rye bread.  I have to admit, this is one of the best raw salmons that I've had in a while. Seasoned just right, thinly cut, and not fishy at all.  

I thought that the staff was as good as it gets.  They were attentive and kept our drinks filled.  The owner was also around making her rounds.  But what I noticed is that she was genuine and sincere with her guests.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when you're in a middle of a conversation and a waiter\/waitress interrupts you.  Our waiter was great with his timing and was around when he was needed.  Kudos Eat!!!

I will definitely be back because there's still more that I need to try.  My only regret...I forgot to try their Beignets.

Small and quaint. Love the open kitchen and the whole design of this place. We went there little bit after they opened (8AM), and place was somewhat packed. 

SERVICE
Attentive and friendly staffs. Warm greetings in and out. 

FOOD
I was craving something sweet (Yes, from early in the morning). After scrolling through some pictures I knew I was sure to get their Cinammon biscuit. It;s a cinammon biscuit with strawberry sauce, garnished with raspberry and strawberry. Beautifully presented and it was good! Biscuit itself wasn't warm as I expected it to be and was very crumbly. I liked how strawberry sauce wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. 4\/5

Also got to try Chicken fried steak which I had no clue of. Never had this in my life. I learned that although it's called chicken fried steak, it's not a real chicken. This southern dish is a steak that is coated with flour and pan-fried, like a fried chicken. I can't really compare this with chicken fried steak from other places as I never had it before, but I enjoyed this hearty dish a lot. Came with crispy potatoes and few toasts on the side. What a great way to start a morning...5\/5

The menu is short and sweet and everything is delicious.  I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed.  Not only is the food good, but the presentation is great.  The grilled cheese and tomato salad is great and flavorful, as is the free range chicken and mozzarella sandwich.  If you're going for breakfast, either the pancakes or the huevos motulenos (their most popular dish) are the best choices.  

The Chef\/owner Natalie is always there greeting people or helping put out orders and you can tell she really loves what she does and that this place is her baby.  I'm going to continue dragging all of my friends here and making sure everyone I know gets to experience eat.!",2,0,1

There was construction going on too.  It's a small place so I can imagine the line later during the day or weekend.

I ordered a truffled egg sandwich.  My friend wanted eggs benedict but they only serve it during the weekend so she opted for the Mediterranean egg white frittata.

Truffled Egg Sandwich:
Scrambled eggs with mushrooms, feta cheese, 2 strips of bacon and chives with a side of smashed potatoes. The bread was crispy...I would normally skip half of the bread but it was good that I had to eat the whole thing.  The saltiness from the bacon, the creamy mild tartness  from the feta, the earthiness of the mushrooms and chives with fluffy scrambled eggs...I. could. not. stop. eating. 5\/5

Mediterranean Egg White Frittata:
I normally prefer egg whites and have nothing to do with egg yolks.  This is my idea of a perfect breakfast minus the olives since I'm allergic to them. It has spinach, tomato, sprouts, feta cheese with an English muffin.  My friend was lucky it had olives, otherwise, I would have been all over this too. 5\/5

I had the free range chicken sandwich with fresh mozz, tomato and pesto mayo on ciabatta. So yummy!! You can get house made chips or potato salad and 'a really good pickle'. The waitress, who was nice and attentive, asked if I'd rather have the tomato salad, why of courese I want the lighter option!! The tomato salad was good! Cherry tomatoes with fresh sliced garlic, balsamlic dressing, basil...simple and yum! However, I wish it was not served in such a big bowl because it made the portion look super tiny. 

The non adventrous food eating BF had eggs, home fries and bacon. You can't go wrong. Their home fires are big pieces where most diners are smaller and end up mushy(but still yummy) I liked the stability of these yummy nuggets!

As for the food now the menu changes every so often, which isn't a bad thing. I used to get the Downtown Benny, which was basically and eggs benedict, eat. style, but I believe that is off the menu now. The beignets were very tasty while they were offering them, but those were replaced with cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote which are ever better. The Huevos Montellenos are really good as well, there's a surprisingly nice mixture of favors that compliment each well, so I would recommend that. Shrimp and grits are probably the best I've ever had, although I do not eat shrimp and grits often but it was de-lish here. Lastly, the Chicken Fried Steak, holy cow! Amazing. I would have never know how good a Chicken Fried Steak could be had not my boyfriend ordered. That's not really an item on the menu that calls out to me, but eat's was epic.

The restaurant itself is concrete floors and walls, so it was very cold in there.  I wore my jacket the entire time.  I ordered a coffee to warm up, but alas it was the bottom of the pump dispenser so it was lukewarm and watery, very weak.  I had to wait until the next pumper came out to warm it up...and the new batch was still pretty weak and watery tasting.

But coffee isn't what sells a place, the food is.  My husband got the shrimp and grits.  It was good, the shrimp tasted very fresh, but at $12 (and 3 shrimp), it was a little steep.  I got the Huevos Motulenos which is eggs, red and green chili, and bananas (weird, I know, but I wanted to try it).  Again, it was good.  Just good.

We walked and were seated right there and then. I do want to add that this place can getting pretty packed so try to be here early. 

I ordered the country fried steak and it was bomb! A little salty but that flavor was so good and the potatoes were cooked to perfection and had a little bit of butter. Also, they can add cheese to your eggs to make it like an omelette mmmmmm! They do have the fried deviled eggs that we ordered but the main dishes were so filling.

It was very clean and sleek. I loved the open bar looking into the kitchen or the large table in the middle. Overall, just cute place.

We spent the afternoon exploring Freemont Street and towards of end of our exploring found ourselves hungry. I knew this place was in the area and after a quick Google search, found it to be on a couple of blocks from where we were. 

So from Freemont Street we walk over. It's about 1PM on a Wednesday. We're seated immediately. After our hot walk through the sun we were pretty damn thirsty. Sadly, we waited over 5 minutes for our waitress to stop at our table and then another few minutes just for her to grab us some waters. 

Before I go to into detail on the service, let's talk about the food. I have no complaints. It's a breakfast\/lunch place. It's sandwiches. My seared chicken sandwich was pretty good. Juicy, and the house made mayonnaise was solid. Also, their potato salad is on point. Again, very good. My fiancé ordered the Reuben and honestly it was huge. I had a bite and really could just tell by the look of it that it was going to be good. Good\/great food and for the price I had no complaints. 

Now the service on the other hand? Not so great. I noticed the sign near the door that said maximum occupancy was 86 people. There were maybe 20-25 people, if that? And three waiters\/waitresses for those tables. So when I said I was pretty thirsty when we walked in, I really was. I downed my water in a minute or two and then sat there for the next ten minutes looking for our waitress who was nowhere to be found. I noticed she was waiting on our table and the table of four next to us. Then a different guy came up and started waiting on us. Okay, no big deal. He stops at our table and asks if I want more water - the glass is empty and we don't even have our food yet...what the hell do you think?!?

Female waitress eventually comes back after the male waiter dropped off our food. She asked if we needed anything, etc etc. She then disappears again and that was the last we saw of her basically. Male waiter brought our bill and rung it up. 

Overall the food was good and the price was fair but the service needs some work. I shouldn't be waiting ten minutes for a refill on water. And why did my original waitress just disappear? And why is this all happening with maybe 25 people in the place? 

Bottom line is I would hate to see this place packed and with a line of people waiting to be seated. Bourdain brought me here by watching his show, but I'm not sure I'd be running back the next time I'm in town.",1,0,0

I went on a weekday at 12:30 for lunch. Place was packed and I'm thinking I will never get in. The hostess said the wait time was ten minutes and I still thought yeah right. She is just saying that so I don't leave. NOPE. I was seated in less than ten minutes. Awesome.

Instantly I am greeted with menus and our drink order was taken. As a foodie I had only been studying the menu online for weeks now so now I play the game pretending to read the menu and waiting for my friend to decide. It was hard to decide because truthfully I wanted to try like five things. I settled on the grilled cheese and chips. 

GRUB: Grilled Cheese. Cheesy, buttery, crunchy heaven. It's on thick sourdough bread and served with a delicious, intense tomato soup. Dip that shit and find an instant happy place. Suddenly the restaurant didn't seem so noisy. The food was THAT good. My friend also enjoyed her grilled cheese just as much. We also ordered a side of homemade chips which were perfectly seasoned and crisp. Good stuff. 

On top of the killer food they also played some of my favorite music: The Killers, Xx, Vampire Weekend and Morrissey. I loved everything about this experience.

The only negatives I could see people having would be that it is very busy and gets VERY loud. It would be the perfect spot to fire or breakup with someone. Parking sucks orangutan taint, too. Mostly metered parking around, but I did find a side street with no meters. I am not use to carrying change around. This isn't LA, fools.

Service: This is where they lost 2 stars. Very first strike was when we arrived and asked for a table for 5 adults and 1 WHEELCHAIR. The hostess at the front responded ""Why don't you put her in a high chair??"" Are you freakin kidding me?! Our response: ""You're going to put my grandmother in a high chair??!"" She apologized and said she was thinking we brought a child. Regardless if it is a child or adult, if we ask for ADA compliance, that's what we should get. She was insensitive and her comment made her seem like a complete idiot. Here is some advice for that hostess: Listen to UNDERSTAND, not listen to respond. Maybe you wouldn't come off as so incompetent. I really wish I got her name. Second strike was our server, Gary. Granted, we are a large party (6 people) and it was a busy morning. But we would appreciate if you don't come up to us and talk to us like we didn't know English. There's a difference between talking clearly and concise and talking like an asshole. Learn the difference. 

Honestly, all the OTHER servicers, expediters, and bussers were extremely polite and friendly. They worked quickly and were very attentive. Just a couple rotten apples in the batch. 

Location: Easy to find with GPS and the large sign out front makes it easy to spot. Right across the street from the Las Vegas Container Park. Near Fremont Street.

Parking: Street parking. $2 per hour, plan accordingly. Good thing is they do it in 30 minute increments. 

Wait: We were quoted 15 minutes upon checking in and waited about 30 minutes. But they have a larger waiting area inside and a bench outside.

Eggs Benedict had a nice, tangy hollandaise sauce that was balanced with a tomato slice, served also with thin slices of turkey and spinach. Side note: love watching the egg yolk drip down when it's cut into. Can never get enough of #yolkporn, amiright? 

My truffle egg sandwich was heavenly. When you think about it, sometimes the hardest dishes to get right are the most common ones. Who hasn't had a million egg sandwiches already? Yet every aspect of their egg sandwich was on point. Crispy but soft bread, yummy buttery scrambled eggs, bacon, & mushrooms were all so individually good. It's making me drool right now! 

The shrimp n grits harkened back to my North Carolina days. It was served with bacon, and two over medium eggs (but looked more like over easy eggs). If I had one complaint it would be the slightly undercooked eggs. 

Two of the dishes came with roasted potatoes that had crispy skin dusted with a cheese-dust\/powder. 

We sat outside, had our coffee, and got there early enough where we didn't need to wait (8:30 on a Sunday, and it was filling up fast). The staff was super friendly too, and it was an enjoyable and relaxing experience.

She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

Part of the downtown Las Vegas revitalization, Natalie Young's ""eat."" seemed a great choice for early Saturday breakfast and keeping in mind the total dearth of Las Vegas traffic in the early morning hours it was a mere 10 minute drive from the MGM to the small modern eatery where we would find Chef Young already hard and work and an acoustic musician filling the room with tunes from Pearl Jam and Led Zeppelin as we sat down.  Designed as a sort of upscale urban soul food space for locals and featuring a menu both familiar but interesting, all composed of locally sourced fresh ingredients I knew right away that I was going to like eat. and although our server J.D. seemed a bit hung over (or perhaps just socially awkward) the moment food began to arrive my suspicions were confirmed.

Starting first with great coffee, copiously refilled throughout our hour-long visit, and moving straight to shared plates of NOLA-quality beignets, crispy buttermilk pancakes with pure maple syrup, and a plethoric fruit cup it was obvious from first bite that Chef Young is not skimping on ingredient quality and although I favor sweet to savory 95% of the time the meal only got better when we moved onto our main plates; the shrimp snappy and sweet with exceptionally toothsome grits and the truly unique pairing of heat and sweet tossed with peas, feta, and two poached eggs quite unlike anything I've had before or since - the Motulenos an absolute must order and the restaurant more than enough reason for local or tourist to get up early and trek off-strip.",11,2,3

I had the downtown benedict which was delicious and the side of potatoes were actually crispy not soggy! My husband had scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. The sourdough toast was thick cut, buttery and delicious. My son got the pancakes which by far out shined everything. The pancakes were the best I've ever had, and I am not a pancake person. I have not had pancakes in years. I prefer waffles because I like a crunchy outside with a tender middle and pancakes are usually just soggy sponges. But these pancakes were absolutely amazing. They were crispy on the edges and so fluffy in the middle. The flavor was perfect - buttery and light, just needed a dab of maple syrup. I could not stop taking bites from my son's plate. Luckily, he could only eat 2, so I could eat as much of the 3rd one as I wanted to. This dish has made me rediscover pancakes!

We also had the strawberry cinnamon sugar biscuits. The biscuits were nice and tender but the strawberry sauce which was poured all over everything was too sweet and overpowered everything. I would have preferred a side of the strawberry sauce to dip the biscuits instead of it being dumped all over.

For a small place, it gets quite loud. It gets crowded too so expect a wait. The wait is worth it though, especially for those pancakes!",0,0,0

We misunderstood and walked over to the bar top only to be confronted by the server who basically asked who sent us, and we were escorted back to the hostess where this waitress whispered to the hostess in front of us. SORRY didn't know it was that BIG of a deal. Then we waited an additional 30 minutes while we literally watched the waitress and hostess clean off all the tables... SO the restaurant was practically clear and clean and un-seated while we and MANY others waited in the waiting room. It was just ridiculous.

We were seated promtly and the chef was there overseeing everything. The food was average. I ordered the posole and shared the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was great but there was not enough meat for the bread. I had half the sandwich and then had to leave the other half of the bread alone since there wasn't enough meat to eat with it. 

The only downside to this place is that it gets EXTREMLY loud when the restaurant is full. When we first arrived the place didn't have that many customers which was why we were seated promptly.

I kind of depend on YELP reviewers to help me decide where I'm going to spend my hard earned cash or in this case, cash I won at the casinos. 
Our table ordered several dishes and we all shared. 
The Chicken Fried Steak was amazingly tough given the fact that the inexpensive cut of beef was tenderized!       The dwblta was served with a very hard, unripe, and inedible avocado.    The ""made to order"" beignets came to the table fresh out of the fryer.  They ""looked"" very good.  Unfortunately, they were very dense and really needed a lot of jam and mascarpone to give enough flavor.   I'm not sure whether they were really ""made to order"" or just ""refried "" to order.  The Huevos Motulenos dish wasn't too bad....actually not bad at all, but the potatoes were tasteless.  
The coffee was good.  But, the mug it came in looked as if it had been previously used.  Coffee drips were on the front and back of the mug....not necessarily from someone drinking from it...but none the less, not a clean looking mug.  Later, I asked some server walking by to get me a clean mug, and without hesitation did so and filled it with fresh coffee.    
We asked for an extra plate and got the smallest plate possible.  So, we asked again and finally received one after a wait.  We asked for extra jam and immediately got the jam, as well as attitude from some tattooed server\/cashier.
The servers were many...in fact there were so many different ones coming to our table to do things (two to take our order, two others to serve, another one to get the plate, and yet another one to bring the attitude, and still another to bring the check or it could have been the same one....bottom line it would be nice to have just one who tends to our table.   (BTW, our initial servers who took our order were out the door by 9ish that morning. We couldn't figure that one out.  Maybe that was why it seemed we had so many different servers plus it appeared some were in-training.)   I paid and left a small tip because not every server there was lacking ""good waiter"" qualities.  
There are so many restaurants competing for our business and thanks to YELP it makes it a little easier to decide.  But it is unfortunate when customers don't take the time to critique bad experiences.  What we experienced today does not appear to be a one time thing.....but a lack of control over the quality and preparation of the food and the disregard for its customers experience.

The restaurant is spacious and you don't feel like you're sitting on top of each other, which is nice. Everyone working there is super friendly. Although Charity was supposed to be our waitress she was very busy with other tables, so another waitress helped her out. I even noticed Charity find a woman's credit card that was left on the table after the group had already left and she ran out of the restaurant to find them (they were parked across the street). Although Charity didn't take our order she still checked on us while we were eating. 

Speaking of food, we ordered the Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak with sunny side up eggs, and a side of short stack pancakes. The eggs benny was deliciously light and perfectly poached.

I was excited to try this little joint but wasn't wowed like most of the folks seem to be. 

The service was friendly, fast and accurate and the mood of the restaurant was very California hipster vibeish, which should be expected for a place like eat.

I had the 2 eggs, bacon and chive potatoes breakfast for $10 with $3 passion iced tea, my hubby had the huevos monteluños for $11 and $4 OJ and he was not too thrilled about the overwhelming flavors that weren't mixed in well. 

The main complaint on his part was that there were some bites that were too spicy and some that were too sweet, therefore the concoction didn't seem to pair off very well but he still liked the meal.

I on the other hand can't justify paying $10 for a mediocre breakfast. The portions were very small and it was nothing special. I would have liked to have ordered something different but there wasn't too much on the menu to choose from. So I opted for the simple, expecting that at least the size of the meal would compensate for the lack of wow factor.

Charm, character, and frankly, they need more places like these downtown. Just across the street from Container Park and down the street from LVA (geez, where were all these places when I was a student?!). 

PARKING: There's metered parking galore for around $2 an hour during the daytime around here and DO NOT think you can get away without being fined. 

PROTIP: Get a player's card at El Cortez (free; takes two minutes) and you get to park for FREE at either of the manned parking garages (located at 7th and Ogden). Even when they charge $10 parking on Fridays\/Saturday nights now, it's free if you flash your card. If you suck at parallel parking like I do even for the after-6pm free street parking, then park in the garages (you don't have to worry about walking too far to get to Container Park or the Fremont East bars). 

AMBIANCE: Eat. is a cute breakfast\/lunch place. They're only open 8AM-3PM on weekdays and close an hour earlier on weekends. I like the decor and there's a ton of seating here for 2-4 people tables. Great use of space without feeling too cramped. There's a nice breakfast bar area near the cashier but I feel like it's a secret ""oh-god-please-don't-pick-to-sit-here-because-you'll-just-stare-at-us""-type thing. Luckily there's another high table bar in the center that you can sit at. 

Hip, casual atmosphere. Fun place to meet with friends or a semi-loud business lunch.

FOOD: I ordered the chicken sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (they offer it every monday) Every other day than monday, they offer a special off-menu item so be sure to ask! 

I thought it was kind of funny listing ""free-range chicken"" at every mention in the menu. I wanted to ask my server for a profile of my slaughtered hen right there. You know, just to make sure it was a happy free-range chicken when it was living. 

Chicken pot pie ($14ish?) was good. Nicely seasoned with the right amount of mashed potatoes, gravy (dear god the gravy), carrots, slices of moist chicken, and peas inside. The pastry encasing it was fluffy, golden, and wasn't too hard biting into it. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens and sliced carrots. Presentation was nice! Does it blow me away for what it is flavor-wise? Nope. Delicious, yes. Very well-thought out, but not wowing. Portion was decent, but not really worth the price tag. 

My chicken sausage ($5ish) side dish was okay. A bit tough, but the flavor was decent. Honey-soaked flavor. Tasted fine but not really worth the price for portion honestly. 

Service was good. Checked back on us often and our server recommended the pot pie to me. 

VERDICT: Overall, Eat is a few unique steps up from your average brunch place. Presentation of the food is gorgeous and the flavors are good\/okay, but the price tag? Ouch. Maybe it's quality of the ingredients that justifies it. The food isn't mediocre by any means, but it's not something stunning as I'm led to believe. It's a great place to reenact scenes from Portlandia. I would definitely come back for lunch with the girlfriends. I like Eat a lot, but I'm not drinking the kool-aid just yet.",6,4,5

Both visits have come on weekends, where the menu is slightly different. The second visit was on a Sunday, when you don't have to dig for quarters to feed the meter.

I've now had the beignets, pancakes, Downtown Benedict (only available on the weekends) and Huevos Motulenos. All of the food has been outstanding. In fact, if I was rating this place just on the food, it probably would have been a five-star rating. The servers were competent, but nothing special. In fact, my coffee cup sat empty for long stretches on both visits. 

My real issue comes down to the lack of an overall ""WOW"" that I'd expect from a Downtown Project-invested business. First, when ordering today we were informed of a new policy that forbids substitutions on the weekend. Something as simple as swapping the sausage out for bacon or asking for eggs over medium instead of eggs over easy. The server even said he didn't want to submit it because he didn't want any more demerits. Second, when we went to pay, there was a note in folio that ""when they are slammed"" they only accept one credit card when checks are being split. Both of these policies will be enough to stop the casual diner from returning. Substitutions are a reality in the restaurant business and splitting checks among multiple credit cards is also commonplace. 

Finally, we did not receive a ""warm fuzzy"" from Chef Nat. She was there on both of my visits and, even though she wasn't working in the kitchen, never stopped by our table. In fact, on my most recent visit looked downright unpleasant until my wife said ""have a nice day.""

Eat them while they're hot, with the melting side of vanilla mascarpone and tart fruit jam.  Yum.  The egg white frittata filled with spinach, tomatoes, olives and feta is equally good.

The restaurant was filled with patrons but not in an overwhelming sense. We were seated at kind of an awkward table. It was a tiny table RIGHT next to a bar-like seating area. We sort of felt weird sitting in regular height chairs right next to people sitting on bar height chairs, but whatever. Definitely not enough to keep us away. I ordered a hot green tea (which was organic and didn't turn the water a lime green color, I hate that!) and the shrimp and grits. Boyfriend ordered their country fried steak and eggs with a side of pancakes to share.

Shrimp & Grits: SOoosososososoo delicious. I love the smooth texture of their grits  and the hints of crispiness from the bacon and pico de gallo. The shrimps (which they gave an abundant amount of) were cooked perfectly and the over-easy eggs they topped the whole thing off with gave the whole dish an extra creaminess that nobody can get mad over. They give you really big portion so I didn't end up eating the whole thing. Boyfriend didn't mind finishing it off at all :)

Country Fried Steak and Eggs (with seasoned potatoes): I had a bite of the steak and it was delicious. Not to much breading and the meat was tender. The gravy was perfect. Thick but not pudding-like. (gross)

Pancakes: The pancakes were sooooo fluffy and delicious. They had a yummy crispiness all around the edge and had a beignet-like texture and flavor to them. They soaked up the syrup like nobody's business so I suggest you do the 'pour and eat right away' method. 

The service was OK. Our waiter checked on us to fill up our drinks (once) but then forgot that I wanted more hot water for my tea. It's conveniently located right beside the container park so I could see us having breakfast\/brunch here again.",1,1,1

In all honesty, I have to agree with the glowing reviews. Great place to get some good comfort food downtown. It's a bit hard to find, but 5 minute walk off Fremont street. If you're downtown or heading down that way I'd strongly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. This place has a menu that offers a broad selection from pancakes with chicken maple sausage, grilled cheese on Texas toast with tomato soup to a mozzarella caprese style chicken sandwich. Various side dishes are offered. The food was nicely presented and tasty. Tasty passion fruit unsweetened iced teas is available to whet your appetite. Come early or come late. Usually busy at mealtime. And yes there is counter to eat at where you can watch the creations being made. A pretty good way to start the day.

Highlights:
Huevos Montulenos: amazing breakfast\/brunch dish that feels relatively healthy. Basically a more exciting huevos rancheros with over easy eggs, two delicious salsas, black beans, feta, and bananas (they were a little surprising at first, but added an interesting element of sweetness).

Bahn Mi Sandwich--this dish is no longer on the menu, but it was super delicious and sometimes available if they have the ingredients in house. 

Downtown Benedict--classically amazing in every way.

We came for brunch, and the brunch menu is different from the breakfast menu online so the truffled egg sandwich I wanted to order wasn't actually on the menu. :( Instead, I had beignets, which were just ok. They were moist and doughy, not the light fluffy texture I associate with beignets. There was a box of Cafe du Monde beignet mix sitting on a shelf in the kitchen so I guess maybe they use that? But the texture was unlike the real thing and not even like the ones I've made with the same mix at home. They were served with a really tasty jam that greatly improved the flavor, though.

I also found the coffee to be a bit weak, which is normally not something I would not even bother to mention, but I think it's important for a breakfast\/brunch spot to have great coffee.

My husband had a chicken-fried steak which I did not sample. I did try all of the accompaniments, though, and the potatoes, eggs and especially the toast were all pretty delicious. Maybe savory food is the way to go here!

Our waitress was pleasant if a bit scattered and we did get seated right away despite it being basically peak breakfast time.

Our waiter seriously only checked up on us about twice and what made me so angry was that they gave us the check before our food even came out!!!! Are you effin kidding me?

I had their shrimp and grits and it was okay, lacked a lot of flavor. Today we went back with my family and waited for over an hour! The host kept seating people left & right instead of trying to hold a table for us since a lot of people came after us. I understand smaller parties get seated quicker but it was only 6 of us.

There was a little wait, 25-30 minutes which was expected since it was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show.

Got the cinnamon biscuits in strawberry compote for an appetizer for four people. Our group ordered poached eggs over corned beef hash, Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon, shrimp & grits, & your basic American breakfast-eggs, bacon, toast, & pancakes. Our appetizer-I barely tasted any cinnamon. The biscuits were OK but thought the strawberry compote would be paired better with something else. However, the compote was refreshing and good. After having a sample of everyone's dishes, I like the shrimp and grits the best and the fluffy pancakes the second. I did not like the Eggs Benedict (who invented turkey bacon?) and my corned beef was not that great.

I thought the plates all had a beautiful presentation but many of the flavors did not come together for me. There were other items I would love to try but after sampling several dishes, I'm not in a hurry to come back here but not opposed to it if someone wanted to come here.

Both days there was a line -- a testament to the quality of the food. The servers were so friendly, efficient, and worked well together. The food was delivered quite quickly, was delicious, and came in huge portions.

On the first day, we sat at the community table to get seated quicker. We were seated with a couple from LA, who were in Vegas for a wedding. They said EAT was their favorite place for breakfast and they always eat there when they come to Las Vegas. They gave us some great suggestions of what to eat before they left. We started with their recommendation of the cinnamon biscuits covered in strawberry compote. They were even more delicious than they sound. Oh my! Then my wife and I split an order of The Huevos Motulenos, which consisted of two fried eggs w\/ red & green New Mexican chili, black beans, peas, feta, & sautéed bananas on a corn tortilla. Different, yet delectable. 

Before we were served our Huevos Motulenos the server asked if four new people could join our community table.

We were a party of 4 that day. 2 adults with 2 minions.
We sat down, menu pages clipped to a clipboard... spiffy. As I scrolled through the menu I immediately get the I should've done a u-turn because nothing genuinely appealed to me and nothing on it was something my minions mouths could be entertained by. Now note....MY minions. So if you have kids and they're into such selection, don't go talking about my review and how there are plenty for kids. =P

It felt like we had forever minutes to go through our menu. I must've flipped those 3 pages as long as it takes to watch Titanic. Of course I'm joking, but you get the drift. I'm going to skip the fine details inbetween but by the time our waiter got to us, he seriously asked us if we needed more time. At this point, I had told my husband numerous times I am not feeling the vibe and I'm ready to exit to prevent anymore disappointment. The waiters didnt even look happy to be there, people are staring at their cellphones like they've been sitting through the Titanic movie for the 3rd time in one sitting.

I immediately replied, noooope, we are ready. Waiter seriously didn't even look at us in greeting form or just to connect. He was seriously distracted by something. He was taking our orders but looking up and around, as he was jotting it. Imagine your waiter not looking at you, looking around, looking behind his back like he is being chased, and is pretending to be a waiter until his assailants have passed by, then he can rip the waiter uniform off and be on his merry way. 

The meal took too long to come considering what we ordered. My husband had the half bowl posole with a stale piece of tortilla chip. He said the stale tortilla chip ruined the vibe. I side ordered their chive potatoe and scouts honor...a bowl of burnt potatoes were served. I don't know if there were garlic pieces in it or whatever...but they were burrrrrnt. Did I say anything? No. I was tired of waiting and our metered parking by then was down to 20minutes. Eat what wasn't charred and move on. I ordered the free range chicken sandwich and decided for the house chips. For the waiting time for our meal to what was serve...it definitely did not live up to what it looked. Chicken is supposed to be pan seared...but my chicken tasted more like pan seared in bulk just to reheat later. I didn't like that my chicken was a bit cold. Not to mention it was pretty bland. I had to open it to double check if the pesto mayo was even smeared in there.  Even their house chips were over cooked--abandoned.

Our server was MIA the whole time...which made everything about our experience here a reason to not return. I literally had to catch him as he was clearly planning on by passing us, failing to realize my husband needs an h20 refill. Just give us our check. 

I seriously walked out with regret. That says a lot. I never want to make negative reviews, but it is my quest to eat somewhere and decide what is true annnnd if I personally find it kid friendly.

Negative reviews on service....very true in my experience. My kids were the only kids there at that time. I didn't find the menu too kid friendly. But scope the menu ahead because I didnt. It's good to not be so planned in such a calculated world. I loved the decor and concept, and imagined it being a cute place to eat at with a friend or partner after a walk or something...just didn't live up to the hype or what I hoped it'd be.

Sadly, I won't return. Unless, a friend wanted to go. I always say give it a shot because my experience doesn't necessarily mean it'll be everyone's experience.

High chairs available with working buckles, yay. I'd leave the stroller in the car just to make it less of a hassle. 

2 stars is what the gut said to click.

A little seedy from the outside, but that all dissipated when you walk through the door into a modern, chic diner.   They don't take reservations, but come early to avoid the wait.  We got there just before eleven on a Saturday and were able to be seated right away.  There was a bit of a wait (in 100+ heat!) by the time we left.

On to the food - in order of yumminess, BOLDs are HIGHLY recommended:

GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH on ciabatta - This was the highlight of the meal.  Stuffed with tomato and arugula, - warm, tasty, and fresh.  I would definitely recommend this.

BIEGNETS - SO yummy!!!  Probably best to share, since they really are just donuts, but so soft and warm, and perfect with the jam and cream.

SHRIMP AND GRITS - This was really good.  I can't even explain it - it really just looks like a bowl of runny grits with shrimp, but the flavor was superb. 

Huevos montunlenos - I know these are a big hit on Yelp, but maybe I'm just not a Mexican breakfast type of person.  I recognize that these had a good, spicy flavor with the salsa and tortillas cooked in, but just not my cup of tea.  Now, if you LOVE your Mexican breakfast, go for it!

Tomato soup - I agree with the other reviews - really salty.  We initially had wanted the tomato salad, but were told they were out and only had the soup, which we settled for.  Oh well.

All in all, a great meal.  My dad still talks about it weeks later.  Street parking was not too difficult.  And it's just down the street from where they shoot Pawn Stars, so you can spend a little time walking off your food perusing there!  :)   (did I just embarrass myself by admitting we watch that show so much that we recognized the shop driving by?)",1,1,0

I ordered the eggs Benedict, which seems like a weekend special only (It wasn't on the menu). It was ok--I think the presentation was better than the actual food. There was a little too much hollandaise sauce and it tasted like any other eggs benedict; not a ""special"" if you ask me! The potatoes were good--it was due to the seasoning though...just the right amount of salt!

My friends got the corn hash, tomato soup and truffled egg sandwich. While the pictures all depict a salivating taste in your mouth, collectively, we thought otherwise. It was okay....I guess we were expecting more since the reviews had high ratings. But then again, we are from southern ca--the land of innovation and delicious food. 

Let's just move on to the part that caused me to give this establishment a 2 star rating: Customer Service. Coming into the restaurant, we had a 20 minute wait, which was reasonable for a Sunday. Upon sitting, they took our drink orders and brought it out fairly quickly. Our server took a while to finally take our orders and from there it went downhill. My friend got the soup and it came out first. Thus, we can assume our order was put in (since one person in our party got their meal). But nope! For some reason, the rest of the orders were ""cut off"" and the kitchen didn't receive it. After 30 minutes, our server still hasn't checked up on us (not even to refill our coffee and waters!) and I had to ask another server for our order. You could imagine how annoyed we were seeing tables paying for their meals...even though they were sat after us! Yep...pretty sucky! With 2 apologies and no compensations for the lack of error on their part, I would not come back to this, nor recommend it to others. There are better brunch places out there that are worth trying and I'd rather give those establishments my time for their service. Eat definitely failed me and my friends. While some people won't take my review into consideration, I hope someone from eat will look more into this to ensure it doesn't happen again.",1,0,0

The last 3 times I've been I've had an unfortunate experience.  The first two involved the seating.  When you have open tables and you have no persons waiting, instead of cramming us in the corner, give us an open table (4 of them).  The excuse I got was that they were reserved for 'larger' parties...more than the two in my party.   The second time was almost the same exact experience. 
Today, it wasn't about the searing, it was about the food.   I ordered the two eggs breakfast and my girl ordered the pancakes.  The pancakes are delicious.  Today, they weren't as crisp, but still good.  My breakfast was not up to standard.  I ordered my eggs over-easy.  They came runny and the toast was cold. I table next to us also had a problem with the eggs.  That gentleman ordered the corn beef hash.  He waited for his eggs as long as I did (9 minutes).  As I waited, I nibbled on the pancakes.  I also ordered an extra egg with breakfast.  
So, when the check came, my meal was full price.  I was also charged for the extra egg ($2).  I never complain about the cost of food, but when the order is messed up, it should be corrected on the bill.  It never was.  Maybe cover the cost of the drinks ($3 each) or the extra egg.  Even a discount (maybe 50%) off MY meal.  I'm not looking for free. With so many options living downtown, why would I go back to a spot where they don't take care of the customer?  
I give the waitress props (Christina) because she was obviously perturbed over the problems.  Gary (I think it's his name), that consistently made sure the coffee and water were filled, deserves props too.

I should have asked for more tortillas. It was a shame to let that salsa and yolk return to the Earth. One of the reasons I made the decision to come back was that the coffee and juice are fresh and definitely on point. Didn't need to add anything to the coffee, so that says a lot.

NOT at all what I expected. The chicken was pounded flat, fried and chewy, almost as though it was leftover from last week and reheated. The chicken was hot, so when put on the sandwich bread it wilted the vegetables. They were not crispy and there was no spice. The bread was also overdressed. 

The homemade chips are some of the best I have ever had... crispy, and lightly salted for great flavor.

My issue with eat. however, is how unwelcome I feel when I go there. I work nearby and have stopped by for lunch on a handful of occasions, never really loving the service, but my visit yesterday was the last straw. First, our table was given away after the hostess failed to step outside to call my name (the waiting area inside was full). Second, our order was never put in by the waitress and it wasn't until another server checked on us 30 minutes later that the food was finally prepared. Finally, when the food did arrive, one of our orders was wrong. At that point, we had both already gone over our allotted lunch hour, so my companion gave up and just ate what she had received. 

The server who noticed we never got food did apologize for the issue, but the original waitress who took the order never bothered to come by to apologize. Over an hour and half after our arrival we finally paid and left. I'll probably avoid going back with co-workers in the future - I can't keep taking such long lunch breaks.

A few of our friends had checked it out the day before. It has a relaxed industrial vibe. I particularly like the light fixtures. But the overall feel of the place is cool without pretentiousness. 
We had a chance to eat at the bar which looks into the kitchen. From this vantage you could see the chefs hard at work creating great food. On our visit Chef Natalie was sitting at a table doing admin work near the bar, but even though she worked on these paperwork duties, every dish still went out with her keeping a watchful eye on quality. She would occasionally banter back and forth with the chefs and comment about how they garnished the meal. The waitstaff was professional and friendly and checked on our needs throughout our meal without being obtrusive. 
As for the food, I got the Huevos Motulenos - two eggs over easy with red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta and sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. And Rachel got the Mediterranean Egg White Frittata - Spinach, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, feta and micro-basil with whole wheat Toast. We were both very happy with our orders. 
I liked the sweet and spiciness of my dish and I thought the peas added a great texture and flavor. I would definitely order it again. Rachel really liked how the spinach inside of the frittata was cooked so that it still had texture. The feta on top of the frittata was flavorful, and the olives had a good brininess but didn't over power the dish. She thought each bite had a good combination of flavor and it didn't need any extra seasoning.
Our meal including fresh ground coffee was about $24 (not including tip). Considering the breakfasts and lunches we had at LVH, we thought the price was comparable if not cheaper and the food was a billion times better at eat. Even with the extra we paid for the cab ride, to us, it was worth the trip to get amazing food.
Eat has only been open for about 7 months and I hope that they have continued success. We only get to Las Vegas about once a year and I really hope to get a chance to check out the rest of their menu. We would eat every breakfast and lunch here each time we come to Vegas.",1,0,0

The place wasn't super busy though so no real surprise there. 

The food was the disappointment here. My server said the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo was just okay even though the host told me it was awesome. I should have listened to him because I honestly was not impressed. The soup was watery and didn't taste like a homemade tomato soup. The ""grilled cheese"" which was too huge to even fit in your mouth was covered in butter...gross. I actually got it with eggs and turkey bacon to try and make it more of a full meal. To be honest it was okay, nothing I couldn't make at home though.

We came across Eat. and saw that the rating was in the top 20 of over 4200 restaurants in Vegas and just HAD to try this place... we were soooo happy we did and can't wait to go back for more on the next trip!

Upon entering, it's got a unique look and feel, like a kitchen and dining room.  The staff was all very happy, smiled and gave great service.  Restrooms are clean!!

The menu is AMAZING!  What I did was look around, quickly saw the Reuben that someone was eating and said I wanted that!  Otherwise, I'd still be sitting there trying to decide, because the menu was THAT GOOD!

We also tried their soups, the green chile chicken posole and the Black Bean Chili.  Both were very nice, but that green chile chicken posole blew me out of the water!  The many fresh flavors coming together in that soup were truly AMAZING! WOW!  

The Reuben was one of the BEST I've ever had!  The corned beef on it was perfectly done, but the bread knocked it out of the park!  It was a HUGE, THICK and SOFT coupling of rye that resembled sour dough in it's softness, texture and size, but tasted 100% like a grilled rye - it was AMAZING!  The perfect amount of condiments were also on it, to include their amazing house-made sauerkraut!

The arugula Salad was very nicely done... lots of fresh veggies, greens and great flavors all coming together in a salad bowl - get it with chicken on top!

In all, this is an extraordinary experience... one that'll leave you wanting more!

But let's start from the top. When we arrived it was a short wait. 20 mins for a party of 4. No problem. We ended waiting about 15 mins if that.

We get sat and our drink order taken. So far so good. The sprarkling strawberry lemonade was decent. Would get it again.

And then it went all down hill from there. Our server was very rude and short. Had no personality. How do you expect to make money with that dry personality?!

The food.....was just okay. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. Our two friends took maybe 2 bites of the oh so famous best seller shrimp and grits and didn't eat anymore. Said it was tasteless and nasty. So much for top selling dish huh?!

We were seated quickly and someone came to take drink orders right away. Coffee here was average, but there were other options like lemonade and many teas in the selection.

The menu is pretty standard food for a brunch spot. I ordered the corned beef hash, but it came as meat cubes, not hash. The poached eggs were average and presentation here is clearly not important. While the food tasted OK, it was not outstanding or memorable. There's no reason to wait in line for this.

Service was prompt, but I was surprised that nobody offered water for our table. Just bring water - it's the most basic thing humans need after air. Bring it, or at least offer it.

All were delicious. 
Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so. It is obvious, but not unfriendly obvious, that they are trying to turn tables very quickly.

It's sort of in this strange neighborhood and there were barely any cars around.  However, when you get inside, this place is packed and bustling.  

We ended up sitting at the bar, which was great!  Everyone was very nice to us and we had great service during our entire meal. 

My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak which is ginormous.  You can probably feed about 2-3 people with that dish.  It was heavy but yummy!  

I ordered the oatmeal to be healthy and it was huge!  Portion sizes seem to be pretty large here.  It was really good as it was topped with some cinnamon roasted apples.  I didn't have to sweeten the oatmeal at all because it was so good. 

My friend ordered pancakes which were amazing!  The pancakes were light and fluffy and just delicious!  It's on my list to order next time.  

We also ordered the beignets which I was slightly disappointed about.  I think I've had the ones at Disneyland way too much and nothing can come close to those.  These were decent but just not how I like them which are soft and just melt in your mouth yummy with all the powdered sugar on top. 

There are a ton of other things I want to try on their menu but since I don't live in Las Vegas it looks like I would only be able to eat here whenever we go to the outlets.  It's now on my must stop list for Vegas. 

I also loved their wheat toast!!  You must be thinking that toast is toast but here the toast is fresh, light, fluffy and thick and it's toasted on their griddle.  One word to describe it ... Yummy.  If you like toast, you have to try that here.   

You have to come with an empty stomach because you will leave completely full.  Great stop for lunch or brunch!!!",0,0,0

The customer service here was really great.  Everyone was friendly, and walked around with a smile.  Very very local spot located down the street from the Fremont Experience.

I wasn't wow-ed by my meal, but overall, I was happy with the experience here.  One of my friends described it as ,""a diner with a good attitude"" and that fits it almost exactly.  It is urban-hip in decor, and a pretty small restaurant overall.  On a Sunday at 1p, expect a 20 minute wait.  I don't know if it was the acoustics, but it was pretty loud in there, so we chose to wait on the benches outside.

The servers were friendly and pleasant, and the coffee was strong and hot. I'd already scoped out the menu online, but alas, the menu at the restaurant was not exactly the same (no Shrimp Po Boy?! GASP!) 

Luckily, I had a second choice in mind.  I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, and yep... My Yelp-ers were correct, those are some runny grits!! I generally don't like my grits so thin.  However, it comes with a lot of shrimp (no tails, either!), big slabs of bacon, and an egg (it comes poached, but they ask how you like it, so I ordered it cooked a little harder).  

Because the grits were so thin, I stole my friend's delicious sourdough toast, which was soft and buttery, just the way I like it. The bread helped to sop up the grits, so maybe this meal should come with bread?  My friend enjoyed her corrnbeef hash, and loved that it tasted fresh and homemade. Our other dining companions got the grilled cheese and the huevo ranchero and both said they were delicious.

They were both amazing but the shrimp and grits took the cake! The shrimp were huge and meaty and the sauce with the over easy eggs were to die for. The chicken fried steak had an awesome spice to the breading and was cooked perfectly! The only downfall to this place was no alcohol. Probably didn't need it on New Year's Day!

- The Manager: absolutely rude. Being from out of town, we stopped by Dutch Brothers for some coffee. We brought it in not thinking about it at all. Many of the waiters commented on how much they love our coffee. So when the manager came around and said ""You can have your coffee in here but you can't drink it,"" we thought he was joking and laughed. He goes on to say ""I'm not joking. It's a law. You can't have it in here."" It is an understanding rule, but we were so put off by it because of how rude he said it.

Our server suggested we get a starter... I have to be honest, I have never ordered a starter for breakfast.  He urgently suggested we try the fried deviled eggs.  So we complied and ordered them.  I will be dreaming of these eggs for a very long time.  They were delicious.  The whites are breaded and fried, and yet they were light and not at all oily.  Then the fried whites are piped with creamy, flavorful egg yolks, topped with bacon, sriracha and ketchup.  The combination of hot\/cold\/crunchy\/creamy\/spicy is FABULOUS.

For my main, I ordered the huevos motulenos.  I can't even begin to describe this dish.  The description on the menu didn't make much sense, I just trusted and jumped in.  It was superb.  My eggs were done perfectly, the flavors blended in a way that I never imagined.  I do not like peas, but the notation on the bottom of the menu told me that NO changes to the dishes will be made and after eating this dish I understand why.  Unless you have a life threatening allergy, trust in this chef and just order the dish that appeals to you.  She has put together flavors and textures that we would not normally think of, but they work perfectly.  This dish was a perfect example of this.  I especially loved the banana sauce on one of the eggs.  The chive potatoes were delicious as well. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=gpqlDvGzaN4aZvLybvpk8A

My daughter ordered the chicken fried steak and was not disappointed.  The breading to steak ration was very good and the gravy on top wonderful.  She ate the whole thing and it is not a small plate.  I never finished mine, but it was not for lack of trying to.  https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DAt-XT-3YHrndxuxn-9LZw  The one item that comes with the chicken fried steak is toast, you choose what kind.  She chose the sourdough and it turned out to be a star all on its own.  LARGE slices of fluffy, airy delicious bread.

I have come here plenty of times, and it is always consistent. Even down to a lot of the photos that are posted here on Yelp, that is how the food always looks when I order it or I see it pass by my table. 

I regularly get the pancakes. They are always crispy on the outside and on the edges while being soft and fluffy on the inside. The size is always generous with it filling up most of the plate it comes on. Instead of maple syrup, I normally ask for a side of their homemade strawberry compote to go along with it. I don't normally eat pancakes that way, even if I am at home, but it ends up being a good addition to a already good pancake. Also, while the chive potatoes are good on their own, I would suggest ordering a side of their gravy used for the country fried steak, and pouring some of it over your potatoes. You will not regret it.

Come early since you might end up waiting a bit, especially on the weekends and especially on Sunday, but when you do, get ready for a treat in the downtown area.",1,1,1

Five of us were present with one parking his car. We were told we would not be seated until the whole group was present. We countered with the logical point that our friend was literally two minutes away. Still, we would not be seated because ""we can serve people in less than 20 minutes."" Not sure what that had to do with it. We could have easily sat down and ordered his coffee within that two minutes. Oh well, gotta love rule followers. 

Anyway slightly annoyed we eventually sat down and started with OJ and coffee. Our server was awesome. She had a great attitude and was fun. 

The cinnamon biscuits were crazy hyped as the thing to get so we got 2 orders. Yea, not sure what that was all about. Dry, bland. Sure yea it's awesome I guess, when you sprinkle cinnamon on biscuits and call it a craze? Fail.

Most of us are huge fans of deviled eggs so we ordered those as well. 5 star presentation but 1 star taste. Again, bland. Was hoping for some horseradish taste or seasoning. Just tasted like a deep fried egg which was a unique twist on the item but lacked flavor.

I ordered the eggs benedict which happened to be a special. I love eggs benedict and order them any time I can. I took two bites and pushed the plate back. The hollandaise sauce was bland and the turkey bacon or whatever it was tasted like cardboard. Again, horrible absence of flavor. Hollandaise should catch a slight lemon flavor and bacon of any kind should be exploding with flavor. 

Our server graciously took it off the check but that didn't help my breakfast hunger any.

The inside is sleek, very design forward but all the waiters make it casual.

Past forward to present day. I visited this place recently when I took an out of town vendor to visit this joint because he wanted a good sandwich. Anyway, we went during peak lunch hour and I was nervous about the long wait, but when I got to the joint, we didn't have to wait at all. That should have been a sign.

Anyway, I ordered the BBLT sandwich and he ordered something else. For a place that wasn't that busy, it took a long time for the sandwiches to come out. When I took a few bites, I realized the quality really went down hill from the time it first opened. The other guy wasn't impressed with the sandwich either. 

Now here is the main reason why I will never come back to this joint beside the mediocre sandwich. A few days before this visit, I received a new credit card with new numbers on it and I used it only at a few places (markets and gas stations) and the credit card was never out of my sight and hand. By the way, I always checked for skimming devices at the gas stations. The only transaction where the credit card was out of my sight was at this restaurant and I started getting fraudulent charges on this card about two weeks after my visit. Now I'm not and won't directly accuse someone at this restaurant of skimming my credit card numbers, because I don't have any proof. But knowing that this was the only place that my credit card (with new numbers) was taken out of my sight made me nervous of potential credit card theft.",0,0,0

It seemed like the perfect time to try eat, downtown's newest chef-driven hotspot. I'm happy to say that chef Natalie Young's restaurant fully met my expectations, and the waitstaff seemed slightly more friendly than anticipated. I noticed mixed reviews of the service, but I'm guessing that Romney's loss put everyone in a good mood!

Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was playing when we arrived, and Tony Hsieh was dining at a table in the front corner of the restaurant that I will assume is reserved for him. The soundtrack continued with the 60s\/70s folk theme, which suited me just fine! Choosing between the creative egg dishes and scrambled tofu on the breakfast menu was tough, but I was most interested in the truffled egg sandwich. Served on a buttery croissant (presumably from Chocolate & Spice, like the other pastries served at eat), the sandwich featured a flavorful melted cheese, perfectly scrambled eggs, sauteed wild mushrooms, and a side of tasty breakfast potatoes. I won't be surprised when I see one of those Food Network ""stars"" describing this dish as The Best Thing They Ever Ate, as it is certainly worthy of the praise. My request to leave the bacon off the sandwich was granted without attitude. The wild mushroom mix likely included some pesky shiitakes, but they were tastefully prepared.

I love the feel of this restaurant and can't wait to return to sample the huevos motulenos and explore the lunch menu. My only complaint would be the difficulty of obtaining a coffee refill, but I'm not inclined to subtract a star for that.",8,4,6

The iced tea was phenomenal. We started with the special of the day, their deep fried deviled eggs. UNBELIEVABLE. At one point, I think every single table in the restaurant had one on the table. management: take note that your servers clearly push specials well, and know how to sell them. For brunch, boyfriend had the Reuben with chips, I had the two eggs breakfast with their special sausage, sourdough toast, and a pancake on the side. Everything was incredible. His sandwich was heavenly, served on thick bread, with the best housemate chips I've ever ever had. My breakfast was perfect, the chive potatoes living up to its reviews. My toast was served with a house strawberry jam that was so good it ended up all over my perfectly griddled pancake. All in all, it was a perfect perfect breakfast.

This time around we found ""eat."" just because it was near our hotel. The place is lively but not too long of a wait even on Sunday. They serve a New American style of food that is delicious and healthier than most places you'll find around here.

With a 15 minute wait for 2 people it wasn't too long of a wait. We came in just before noon and the place was bustling with life. With a hip yet eclectic vibe, the place consisted of Vegas locals and as well as their fair share of visiting food goers. 

I ordered the ""Two Eggs Any Style"" with Chicken Sausage instead of bacon and a cup of their hot coffee. The coffee was good but what you'd expect at most breakfast spots. The whole meal was more than enough for any one person but I wish I could've eaten it all. The eggs were great (Over Easy) and the chicken sausage was great too but the star of the meal were definitely the potatoes. The potatoes are cooked with rosemary and onions and has that delicious seared taste that you want in a good set of breakfast potatoes. The best part is that they give you a hefty serving and you'd probably be able to split it if you're thinking of a light start to your Vegas weekend! 

The service was fantastic and the one error I had with my meal was quickly resolved without a hitch. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the crowd that comes in ranges from young to old.

After seeing the reviews we decided to try this place on a Monday morning for breakfast to avoid the crowds and long waits.

When we (7 adults, 3 kids and a baby) checked in for a table the people weren't friendly at all. No smiles, just a ""How many you got"" with a stone face. 

We get to the table, we're short a seat, and when we asked to add a small table, the guy seemed irked that he had to adjust the table because someone set it wrong. Even when the server arrived to get our order he didn't even crack a smile or from. Another stone face no expression person. 

We ordered the cinnamon biscuits, which was a HUGE mistake! It was so dry (yes, I know biscuits are suppose to be dry, but this was like, extra dry, gotta drink water sort of dry) and that gross thick strawberry cough syrup tasting nasty sauce was straight up disgusting! A short stack (2 pancakes), which was just OK. Corned beef hash which came with 2 poached eggs. When I thought of corned beef hash, I thought more of a hash patty type of hash, but it was the type of hash with the tiny cubed potatoes with the tiny cubed pieces of corned beef. We also ordered some Mexican breakfast thing which had a banana under all that Mexican yumminess. Eewww! Wth! So fricken gross! Mexican food with a banana in it! Who's stupid idea was that!?

Anyways, long story short, I would never recommend this place or ever go back again!",5,0,0

A few weeks ago, my husband was downtown on business and called me up asking for a recommendation for lunch. I told him to try Eat. Afterward, he told me about the awesome blta w\/ egg sandwich he had. He took me to check it out the day of the Santa Run, but the santas kept us from getting to Carson and 7th so I'd have to wait to try Eat. Then, last week; success! 

If driving be prepared to feed the parking meter. The restaurant sits on the lower level of Park Avenue Apartments. This tired building is sure to experience a revitalization thanks to the Downtown Project. Carson Ave has become a hot spot for downtown dining and it began with Natalie Young's Eat. She was the first to partner with Tony Hsieh and see her dream to fruition. She is currently working on her next venture, Chow. 

Eat bustled on a late Saturday morning, while there was no line out the door. There was a wait for a table, but counter seating was available. We settled in and gazed over the menu. Our server asked, ""Can I get cinnamon biscuits started for you?"" Many might be duped by the question thinking they are complimentary, only to be surprised later by an $8 charge on the bill. It is a bit sneaky so be warned. Yet, we said, ""yes, bring them on!"" The tender biscuits swim in strawberry compote and are topped with berries. It reminds me very much of strawberry shortcake, add some fresh whipped cream and it'd be the perfect dessert. 

When it came to ordering we skipped right over the breakfast items and went straight for the sandwiches. I had to try the dwblta ($11) myself and the husband went for the killer grilled cheese with tomato soup ($9). During the week more sandwiches are available, they all sound fantastic. However, if I ever get a chance to dine on a weekday, the chilaquiles will be mine! 

I added cheese to my dwblta, I skipped the egg; I don't dig runny eggs, blasphemy, I know. This sandwich was great! All components married beautifully and the sourdough bread held it together without being too bready. It was a thing of beauty, truly. Sandwiches come with a side of house chips, potato or tomato salad. I really enjoyed the tomato salad. Despite my best efforts I could only devour half of the sandwich. I took the rest home. This sandwich could easily be shared. 

He added tomato, egg, and avocado to the killer grilled cheese. It was a tasty twist, especially when dipped in the soup. However, as good as it was we agreed we enjoyed the dwblta a bit more. In fact, it might just be the best damn sandwich in lv.",3,2,1

Always intriguing when a classically trained chef like Natalie takes on traditional food, and eat's fried chicken dinner is no exception.  A promised all-you-can-eat fried chicken meal with all the traditional fixings for $38 (cash only).

It begins with homemade biscuits and cornbread, both warm as if only recently taken from the oven.  The biscuits are hearty, the cornbread perhaps too fluffy as it came apart very easily.  Both are accompanied by butter and artisan honey, which was a great dip for the biscuits (and the chicken skin as well).

The entree is a mix of fried chicken served alongside mashed potatoes, collard greens, cheddar mac and cheese, and corn on the cob.  The chicken is well-cooked, with a batter of a unique blend of spices (guessing paprika, a touch of pepper, seasoned salt, and some oregano-like herb).  The collards are tasty with a hint of pepper kick, the mac and cheese is no-frills made with tasty cheddar, and the corn is seasoned with paprika.  The mashed potatoes weren't all too memorable, but skipping that at least leaves more room for the chicken.

The meal is capped off by warm peach cobbler with a dollop of fresh cream on top.  Fresh peaches, warm from the oven, and the cream supplied a satisfying note that helped temper the heat and sweetness of the cobbler.

The vibe for these dinners is a friendly one, people introduce themselves and experience the food alongside each other.  Natalie makes the rounds herself in her traditional plaid shirt and chuck taylors, making for a real communal ambiance that's in short supply in this town.

You have to either visit regularly or follow eat. on Facebook to find out when the next one is, but once it's announced, get tickets and plan the diet accordingly.  This has to be one of the more unique dining experiences the already vibrant Vegas' dining scene provides.",2,1,1

Service was decent. It was a busy Saturday morning with the Color Run in town that Might have overwhelmed the employees here, but think they did a decent job. It did take us about 25-30 for 3 of us to get seated, which we were completely okay with.

Well I was truly glad that I got our group to let me choose the Saturday breakfast. (They actually had no choice I was driving)

Eat is roughly about a 5 minute drive from the California Hotel making it really convenient. Waiting only 10 minutes after we arrived at 9:00am we were seated in this nice trendy hipster place in downtown. The sound level was a little loud with the music and people chatting but it didn't deter us from enjoying the food and decor at Eat.

*Beignets http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ#FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ Great item to share, jam and mascarpone made this dish yums.

*Pancakes with chicken apple sausage: My friend took one bite and busted out a huge smile. I got to sample the pancakes, melt in your mouth and a slight crunch on the edges of the pancakes made this dish a must.
*Eggs with smoked bacon and smashed potatoes: Smoked bacon was that standout of this dish.

*Outside seating available
*Street Parking
*Friendly Service

We moaned and told her that we were hoping to have breakfast.  Another person (the manager???) overhead our conversation and came over to tell us if we could order quickly that the kitchen would accomodate our order.  We asked what she would recommend; she suggested the Shrimp and Grits.  I had intended to have something really breakfast-like but since that dish was on my 'to-have' list, I thought, why not try it here.  My cousin ordered the steel cut oatmeal and the beignets.  

When the food was served, I split off some of the shrimp and grits to share.  What a mistake; I wish I could have eaten the whole order myself, after having the first bite.  I'm not sure if the restaurant's recipe was traditional, but it sure was gooooood.  Buttered grits on the base, perfectly cooked shrmp, sweet crispy bacon, sauteed pico de gallo, two eggs, and finely chopped red onion.  There was a great balance of flavors and texture.  I'm usually not good with raw onion, but these were cut very fine and were extra sweet so they added an unexpected flavor and texture.  My cousin was also happy with the oatmeal.  This review would have been a 5-star except that the beignets were pretty heavy (suspect that if we had ordered them in breakfast prime-time that they would have been lighter.  But the homemade jam that they were served with was very good so that made up alittle).

It seems as if they have locked in the perfect spot right behind Container Park for when hipsters, foodies and white collars have an appetite.  The only thing they are missing as far as my concern?  Alcohol.

Actually we came by last Sunday morning only to find out that they were closed because they had run out of food on the day before (opening day). After doing our due diligence, we had already decided we would try again this Saturday morning and order their beignets, truffled egg sandwich, and pancakes. We were a bit disappointed when the server told us that they only served a ""special"" (more like limited) brunch menu on weekends and the truffled egg sandwich was only available M-F. Really? That's such an arbitrary limitation, but we got over it. I decided to go with the free range chicken sandwich instead.

The beignets ($8) came out first and looked great. There were 5 pieces, and they were served with a tasty homemade strawberry jam and an overly thick vanilla mascarpone. Unfortunately, these beignets are not light, flaky, and fluffy but rather dense and doughy. They are essentially little doughboys or deep fried balls of dough. Calling them ""beignets"" is a stretch.

We enjoyed the pancakes ($9) which came in a stack of 4. They had a great crispy texture along the edges and were served with a single small but tasty chicken-apple sausage. However, we did note with dismay that both the pancakes and sausage had sections that were charred completely black. I don't know about you, but I like to keep my carcinogen consumption down to a minimum.

The chicken sandwich ($12) came with a choice of homemade potato chips or potato salad. I went with the latter. For the price, we felt the portion sizes were off. The chicken sandwich was kind of small and should be at least 50% bigger while the potato salad was fairly generous. The chicken was underseasoned and sort of bland, but was ok when combined with a bite of the overly salty potato salad.

The space has a trendy downtown loft vibe. Despite the seemingly large number of servers, service was a bit slow, especially on water refills and collecting the check. We would possibly return for the pancakes and perhaps to try the seemingly elusive truffled egg sandwich. However, from a taste and value standpoint, we would pass on the beignets and chicken sandwich.",5,1,2

I haven't been here for the lunch options, but the breakfast options are on point!  Their Truffled Egg Sandwich is solid and so is the Eggs Benedict.

I was a fan of the Huevos Montulenos and would certainly recommend it for the slightly more adventurous eater...lots of flavors coming together to party on you palate.  The Huevos Montulenos consists of a tortilla layered with black beans, sweet peas, feta cheese, caramelized bananas or plantains, covered with two fried eggs, and finished with slightly spicy red and green salsas.  It is also served with a pile of potatoes.

Chef Natalie Young has helped re-ignite the downtown area by giving people a hip trendy spot to start their day. As you step inside, it makes you feel like you're not in the desert, but somewhere in the Bay Area or even NYC. Serving breakfast and lunch, The menu items at Eat definitely has something for everyone. We decided on the Huevos Montulenos and the Downtown Benedict (Served on the weekends only)

Our server was very attentive and offered suggestions as well as answered any 
questions we had before making our decision, and kept our coffee mugs full with the tasty coffee from the Colorado River Roasting Company-YUM!

The Huevos Montulenos is layered with tons of flavor-a tortilla with sweet peas, black beans, saltiness from feta cheese, more added sweetness from bananas(not sweet plantains) covered with two fried eggs and topped with a nice heat from the christmas sauce(AKA salsa rojo y salsa verde) served with a mound of potatoes. The benedict was kinda small in portion size but definitely made up in flavor with the wheat english muffin, turkey bacon sauteed spinach and two perfectly poached eggs that oozes out as you cut into it. Being in the food biz, I can tell whether a place cuts corners, but the hollandaise sauce is the real deal Hollyfield folks...it is dangerously good!

If you happen to be in the area, stop by for a tasty bite. You will not be disappointed!

One of my Besties and her husband were in town and wanted to meet for breakfast. Since they haven't been in the newly renovated DT I figured that this would be the perfect place to have breakfast at. FYI We parked at El Cortez and walked over, which the restaurant is located right behind\/after The Container Park heading south on 7th. 

It was about 930am and the place was relatively full so we waited about 2-5 minutes to be seated. Customer service on this end was good as the hostess greeted us immediately upon entry and as she stepped away to clear up a (or perhaps even our) table one of the waiters walking by asked us if we have been helped. I like that. The place is a lot bigger than I was anticipating it to be however it's very DT. I can understand how this place can get packed especially if there are larger parties. 

Anyway we got our seats and overlooked the clipboarded menu. Our drink orders were obtained off the bat however it did take a while to get our food order. Which our waiter politely apologized for the wait. The food did take a while too but I didn't mind as it gave me the opportunity to catch up with The Newlyweds however my tummy wasn't too thrilled about that as it couldn't stop growling. 

For my drink I opted for the EARL GREY SUPREME tea ($4). It's basically just a tea bag of earl grey with a side of honey, which I dumped the whole lot into my cup. Refills of hot water are allowed....as with the coffee which my girlfriend ordered. 

For food I ordered the EGG TRUFFLED SANDWICH ($12). It was superb. I knew I was getting into something tasty and delicious as I could smell the aroma of my chived potatoes waiting to be devoured. I didn't need to add any hot sauce(s), which are available upon request. There were perfect amounts of scrambled egg, bacon, and  mushrooms in between slices of the warm cibatta bread. 

My buddies both got the pancake stakes($9)--so typical of Newlyweds, order the same exact thing. The stack was three full\/large pancakes and had a sliced chicken sausage atop it with a strawberry and powered sugar to garnish. I'm not much of a pancake girl--maybe with my makeup time to time when I'm rushing--so my review on them will be bias. It was okay. They are very popular here so feel free to order them. Both of them liked their pancakes.

[Note: we really wanted to order the beignets to share however the waiter said that they are discontinued. I know I heard discontinued. Which is a real bummer as they seemed very, very popular so I'm hoping the waiter was just misinformed or meant to say that they were not being served the morning we went. That was a real bummer. Hence the knock of a star for the rating.]

All in all I'm pretty positive that I will be back again. And I'm already thinking I'll be back with the other (Yelp\/Xtian) Bestie as she's jelly that I ate here. Awaiting that CES check first!!! 

It's really a 3.75 star rating if we had decimals to rate with. Would I recommend it-yes. Would I come back-probably. Would I reorder what I ate & drank-definitely the sandwich, however I'd opt out of getting tea again as I can't justify the pricing for it. Maybe I'll just get another drink. There are other options on the menu that I would like to try and maybe I could give an updated review then! 

Happy eats!",3,2,2

After doing some business at 200 Lewis avenue at 8am I was hungry and looked for a place to eat downtown, yes there are many casinos with restaurants around but I didn't feel like going into a casino, besides the traffic court had already beaten them to my money.

 As I was driving away from the renovated areas of downtown into the more shady areas, I spotted this little place in the corner of Carson and seven street known for other kind of activities, so I was surprised to find a restaurant there. 
I parked my car  and searched for quarters under the seat of my car for the parking meter, luckily I hadn't  cleaned my car for months so I found enough change for parking, for breakfast, and even for the bum asking for change.

 The restaurant is located at the corner of an old budget apartment building, but don't let that scare you because once you walk in you'll forget the world outside and be absorbed into a new, clean, modern, cool dinning experience. The place is small and popular so sometimes you'll be forced to share a table with other people, but not to worry, they won't bite, they have good food on their plate.

 By recommendation of the waiter I went with the huevos motulenos, two eggs over easy covered with red and green sauce with melted cheese on top of corn tortillas. The only other place I had this is in Mexico and I cannot tell you how good this is, you have to try it for yourself and do your own sweating. you'll be coming back for more.

They only serve breakfast and lunch and that is a good call, you don't want to be caught in this area after sunset. It all turns into a different kind of venture, you'll become the main course so you better fly like a moth towards the Fremont street experience lights, unless you're looking for something else,..in that case, ask for Lola...now that's five stars!

First impression, nice ambience. Nice artwork on the walls. And overall a pretty neat place to eat. There's an art school down the street so I wonder if they have something to do with it. 

When my bf and I showed up, luckily a table was just leaving, so we got seated right away. I saw beignets on the menu and had to try it! However.. i'm not impressed. It tasted like frozen dough that's fried. It was really heavy and not fluffy at all. 

The Huevos Montelenos which is basically Huevos Ranchers was SO GOOD. I have to go back. There was so much food and so much flavor. I loved it. 

My bf ordered the chicken fried steak which was delicious as well. He enjoyed it, but I personally liked my dish better.

We ended with some coffee and overall, thought the food was excellent. 

HOWEVER! We asked for the check, then asked for the check, then asked for the check probably 3 more times. Waiters kept coming and apologizing for the wait and they'll get to it right away.. and then never do. Finally, when I wanted to walk out without paying, they finally brought it.. probably 45 minutes after we completely finished our meal and our tables were cleaned. That's pretty bad service.

We were seated at a table for two at the end of the counter high table in the middle. The tables were all far apart enough from each other where you didn't feel overcrowded. 

I ordered the eggs benedict and K had the corned beef. I loved mine because the turkey bacon it came with what super extra crispy just the way I like. There was a little too much hollandaise sauce for me but for those who like a lot, then you'll love this! My potatoes were booked perfectly with the right amount of crisp (to me they are the perfectors of a nice crisp!) and the portion was plenty filling for $13. K liked his corned beef but it wasn't the traditional kind you might think of, this one had real pieces of meat. And it came with four pieces of super thick delicious Texas toast. 

It was a great breakfast especially if you're planning on hanging around in the downtown area. We went across the street to check out the container park and walk off breakfast.",3,1,2

This melrose-style place serves up some serious grub. The decor is adorable, unique, slightly hipster. The people keep it real and give honest opinions about their menu- which is short and sweet. Their food is clean, simple, but with tastes that meld together in a satisfying manner. 

The cinnamon sugar biscuits and fresh fruit compote were so amazing. The biscuits were light and fluffy, with cinnamon sugar crunchies on the bottom. The fruit was perfectly saucy, not overly sweet, with tons of fresh fruit and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Bread is thick cut (no joke) and fluffy. Chicken fried steak is well seasoned and cooked. The potatoes that come w it are perfect and seasoned so well. Tomato soup is yummmmmmmmmm. Pickles are great. Pancakes are so fluffy and light. I'm normally not a pancake eater but these were amazing!!! The syrup is real syrup and the eggs were cooked perfectly to order. 

I have way too many good things to say about this place! But to sum it up, new favorite Vegas bfast spot. I'm reluctant to spread the word but it must be done. It does get super crowded on the weekends! Get there before 10am and you'll be happy. Service is great!!!

Must try's- biscuits and fresh fruit, tomato soup, country potatoes, pancakes.",1,1,1

The grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup was great! The sandwich was nice and thick and the cheese was nice and melty. I felt a bit ridiculous eating hot soup when it was 100+ degrees out, but I do love tomato soup and ended up scarfing down the whole thing.

FOOD 5\/5:
I came here with my friends on a holiday. Although it was super busy, the food still tasted amazing. 

-Truffle sandwich ($12): Super good, everything put together well. Potatoes are DELICIOUS. 
-Shrimp&grits ($15): Loved this but wish it had more shrimp. 
-Corn beef hash ($14): The corn beef is in cube-like form, and it was kinda hard. Still good, but wish the corn beef was softer.  

SERVICE 2\/5:
We got sat down after 30ish mins. As we got seated our server came, jotted down what we ordered, but that was the last time I saw him. He never checked up on us AND WE HAD TO ASK 3 TIMES ABOUT REFILLING OUR WATERS to some other server. 
-The server we asked about the refills obviously was getting super annoyed at us....like girl, we don't know where your coworker went AND we are eating savory dishes, we have to drink a lot of water to wash it down. 
-Being a small restaurant, I expected that service would be pretty efficient...guess not. 

The restaurant itself is small and cute. Reminds me of SoCal hipster brunch places. Definitely fits in the Downtown LV area. I would come back here for the food, just don't have high expectations about the service.... 

Tips to know beforehand:
-There are meter parking spots, no free lot. 
-Restaurant may be hard to spot, it's under an apartment complex.

I sat solo at the breakfast bar. I enjoy this because the kitchen is in clear view and you can see everything that's going on. Including communication and hustle of the staff. The girl who cooked my food even came over after to make sure I enjoyed, and suggested something for next time. I LOVE THE INVOLVEMENT!! From everyone!! 
But anyway on to the food! 
First off, the don't have beignets anymore, boo :(
They were fresh and perfect and the mascarpone cheese (that is also a goner) went perfect with the bread and raspberry preserves. Instead they do offer a raison cinnamon bread. I passed because I had my heart set on something else. 
By suggestion of the waitress I went with the ever so popular Huevos  Motulenos. It is a mix of fried eggs, green and red chili, bananas, black beans, peas, and feta served on top of a corn tortilla. I loved this dish. The chili alone was wonderful and had just the perfect amount of spice and flavor. It also blended real well with the other ingredients. I wasn't a huge fan of the banana, but I do not really eat bananas anyway, so no shocker there. I could see how it accompanies the dish for those who do enjoy them.
I was told next time try to truffle eggs, which I intend to do. 
Also, the orange juice was great. Some may not make a big deal about that, but a big glass of fresh OJ with a filling breakfast hits the spot!

The pancakes: thick, fluffy and indeed perfectly golden. So tasty, they didn't even need butter or syrup (not that we didn't add them!).

The truffle egg sandwich: rich flavor, crusty good ciabatta, huge. 

The chicken fried steak: not greasy and surprisingly light, with a crispy breading and just the right amount of (sausage?) gravy to not overwhelm. 

Then, my faves: the cinnamon biscuits--like their version of French toast in biscuit form, and SO GOOD. The sweet (but not cloying) compote and fresh berries made it a delicious treat. Tasty bacon perfectly cooked, crispy but not crunchy. DEVILED EGGS! The white fried in panko, the devil on top with bacon crumbles. You can't miss this dish, a good appetizer or dish on its own (I ate most of ours).

The space was perfect to enjoy the food in, open and roomy, with great creative touches on the wall. I like the open kitchen and bar seating. Everyone there was also friendly, our server was so fast and also helpful, and the food came out fresh, hot, and quickly. Good for my hungry self. 

I hear they get packed on weekends, so get there early. On a Wednesday morning, we got right in, and there was plenty of seating. Even with a wait, it would be worth it. I hope we can squeeze in another morning visit before we leave.",2,0,1

To start, we ordered the biscuits with strawberry compote. The biscuits had a slightly crunch on the outside (which I liked) and weren't too dense on the inside (which I also liked). Covered in strawberries, blueberries and strawberry compote, not too sweet, but just right. 

I had the truffle egg sandwich which was delightful. Bread toasted perfectly, filled with eggs flavored with truffle, bacon, and feta - yum, yum and yum! It came with a side of potatoes and onions. I ate half and I was stuffed!

My hubby had the pancakes which were fluffy and oh so good. It came with a side of turkey sausage that was flavorful and delicious.

The only downside is location. We usually don't go downtown very often and parking is all on the street, metered. Also, after reading other reviews, we got lucky and didn't have to wait (Sunday at 11am) but I can imagine it's not often like that.",3,1,2

It's a room with nothing on the walls or floors to absorb the sound so it's very loud. After we were seated it took nearly 5 minutes for the server just to get to the table. 

The menu is limited in that they are all about that meat and potatoes thing with very few alternative options: no meatless, vegetarian, or gluten free items. 

I opted for a bowl of steel cut oats topped with strawberries & pecans and it was ok. Certainly nothing special about a bowl of oatmeal so I'm not even sure what I expected here. No PB and most have never heard of putting it in your oatmeal. But if you don't, all you get is a bowl of carbs for breakfast

Do they even know what bill time is? In all the time I've been eating out I have never had any restaurant not give me a credit card receipt. It is not your position to assume I don't want one and I should never have to ask for it. Always get a credit card receipt to help prevent fraud.

We won a gift certificate from a silent auction that was a Zapoo fundraiser, but sadly we couldn't find it...which would have been nice to offset the cost.

The location is horrible--on a corner in front of an old apartment building that makes it seem like the restaurant is the motel cafe. Parking, like anywhere downtown is a big pain with the unpredictable parking meter machines.

Looking around the dining room, we could tell it was filled with a lot of Zappos Hshieep. It is a typical hipster type of establishment where concept is good but execution lacks. The menu is presented on a clipboard and features breakfast and lunch items.

I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with 2 eggs, country gravy, Chive potatoes and toast. I opted for over easy eggs and sourdough toast. The best part of the meal was the sourdough toast...thick slices toasted perfectly. The chicken fried steak was bland and the meat was NOT good. I know cubed steak which is typically used for chicken fried steaks, is the ornery brother of meat cuts which must be tenderized\/beaten into submission to properly achieve a chewable consistency. This was not. The meat under the flavorless breading was like an old shoe. The gravy was scarce and made the shoe meat too soggy (note: always get the gravy on the side), the potatoes were also flavorless and boring. The eggs were cooked right. I would not get this dish again nor recommend it.
My wife ordered the 2 eggs any style with bacon, toast and chive potatoes. It was ok, nothing special and not really worth $11. Most of the menu items seemed overpriced.

Service was friendly enough but one of my pet peeves is when a server sees that most of my meal is uneaten, yet doesn't acknowledge that perhaps the meal wasn't to my satisfaction and at least offers an alternative, then goes about like a robot (Hshieep) to bring the check, box the meal etc. No thank you Eat, there too many other better places to eat.

FOOD: The SHRIMP AND GRITS were outstanding. Perfectly cooked shrimp resting in a bed of (cheesy?) grit goodness. The grits are soft and compliment the tender shrimp and eggs. I knew there was a slice of bacon at the bottom of the bowl and I considered asking for my bacon on the side. Yes, I have no shame. But I forgot and I'm so glad I did. The soft thick bacon added texture and salt to the lovely dish.What was the seasoning on the grits? I am embarrassed to say that I didn't slow down enough to think about it. I tried to savor the meal, but ended up demolishing everything on my plate in record time. 

I wish I could say that I'll try a number of other dishes during future visits. But I won't. I have fallen in love (maybe deep like) and have very little desire to explore the rest of the (intriguing) menu.  

If you are unsure about the commitment to quality in this place, keep an eye out for the owner. I saw her wave and chat with a few tables and then go right back to the business of keeping on eye on service and food. In the short time I was there, I saw her giving instruction to a waiter struggling (or so it seemed) with a larger table, checking the hollandaise sauce, and preparing a few plates.

SERVICE: The service was excellent. The host didn't give us an accurate (on any level) wait time, but he was warm. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  That's all I need. 

VIBE: Earthy, eclectic hipster with an edge

EXCUSES: You've already read about the negatives--it can be loud, the meter situation is a hassle, and there will be a wait. But the food is worth it. The city could start construction on Carson and I'd just wear comfy shoes and walk a ways to get to those shrimp and grits. 

If this is where the Vegas food scene is headed (quality ingredients, playful offerings, delicious food, good customer service, community atmosphere), I am excited to support the businesses leading the charge. I'll be back to eat.",4,1,3

This was my 2nd visit to eat. during a recent trip to Vegas.  I went last year when I was in Vegas and I knew that I had to come back.  

It is the perfect little hipster hole in the wall in an ""up and coming"" part of town.  They have a spacious, sun-shining interior and a beautiful little patio too.   They occasionally have live music on the weekends during brunch which makes it the ultimate hipster hangout if that's your thing.

Let's get to the food... 

Cinnamon Biscuits - shared with the table after a recommendation from the bus boy.  Pretty tasty and definitely worth sharing.  Probably too sweet and rich for a meal on its own.    

Truffle Egg Sandwich - my boyfriend had this but I stole a few bites and it was delicious!  Scrambled eggs, mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil on ciabatta.  Can't go wrong. 

BLTA - I had this sandwich on my first visit.  It's a great version of a BLT.  Add an egg to it for the perfect brunch dish.

Greek yogurt - tasty and hearty portion with fresh berries and granola.  A little heavy on the granola and could have used some more yogurt to balance it out.

It's not so much the food or the decor that causes me to reminisce, it's the fact that this place has limited seating, excess patrons, and folks will wait a long time for a table even though there are other good restaurants within walking distance.

If you're dining alone, you can plant yourself at the counter almost immediately. If you're with a group. The wait can be as long as 45 mins, and unlike Hash-House-a-Go-Go, which also always has a long wait, they don't have a pager to give you and you can't just sashay up to the bar while you wait for a table.

I will tell you, these guys really care about their customers.  When I received my Downtown Benedict (one of their signature dishes) I found that the poached eggs were hard boiled.  I didn't even complain, but the manager noticed a look of disappoint on my face and rushed in and had the dish re-fired.

The Benedict was not bad. I picked up a slightly off-putting vinegar flavor from it.  There was probably too much vinegar in the poaching liquor.  The side of skillet-grilled potatoes was pretty good (fresh not frozen). Hollandaise sauce had a smooth, creamy texture. All ingredients tasted fresh, and the plating and presentation was, as I like to say, ""pretty."" 

I would recommend Eat. It may not blow you away, but it's a decent breakfast haven.  Just be aware of the wait and the noise.",0,0,0

Again with the hippy movement. When did Nevada become crunchy granola? I mean, I am sure it took place without anyone asking my opinion and that's fine, I get it. Hippy is cool in a not so cool kinda way. It's like hipsters and their man buns. It's not cool, from the perspective of grown up male adults. But, maybe they place their hair in the bun because that one drunk chick at the club who was kinda sorta cute said ""oh. M. gee!"" 

Like this:

My folks are a product of the 50's and were knee deep in the REAL hippy movement out here in SF. If you told my Dad that the hippy culture was cool and that people selectively chose to become hippies and refused to wash their hair n clothes n stuff and they were attempting to recreate 1960's Berkeley, he'd respond with a simple, monotone voice of ""Why would anyone want to do that?""

That out of the way, the crunchiness at this spot is not for me. I live in an area of the country where the crunch in crunchy was created and I shop at Berkeley Bowl every now and then, so there!!!

Coffee was really good and really fresh. Locally roasted and I am a huge fan of local coffee. On account of the evil mermaid movement and all. 

Food was ok. Not amazing not send it back terrible just flat out ok. 

Truffled egg sandwich had a few bites of delicious and a few more bites of bland. It was odd cause with each delicious bite, I expected the next bite to follow suit. Inconsistent cooking on that order I guess. 

Pancakes were dark, in a good way and pretty solid. They serve a tiny jar of fresh maple syrup with it. Nice touch. 

Expensive, as expected in Vegas but we just ate at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and we chowed there. Chowed as in ordered enough food for 3, but it was just the two of us. This spot shouldn't be in the same price range as that spot, but it is and I'm not intrigued nor interested in that.

As plenty of women have expressed over the years, it's not you, it's me. So I'll end my review with that and allow you to crunchy it up out in the desert if you so desire.",3,4,2

We had to do a yelp search to find it and it was totally worth the effort. My friends and I stopped in here after running the Sprinkler Sprint 5K and we were ravenous. 

Very quaint place, small and interesting menu. Caters to vegans and vegetarians which I love. I ordered the Huevos motulenos which was quite good a little sweet, a little spicy. Served with potatoes which I didn't really like, and a sauce that had black beans and whole peas. The peas seemed a little odd in this dish, like they were out of place. But... still very interesting meal and I ate most of it. It also had tofu pieces in it which were a nice addition.

My friends had the fried chicken which was an enormous portion. They also ordered a side of pancakes for all of us to try. I have never been big on pancakes but I tried these, and HOLY cow these are melt-in-your-mouth pancakes. I can't even describe them other than fluffy. Really good. We will all definitely come back to try other things on the menu, great service and amazing food.",3,1,1

My husband and I wanted to get away from the strip for a bit and grab some brunch before we headed out to Red Rock, so after a quick Yelp scan we showed up here and had to wait about ten minutes prior to getting a table.

Corned Beef Hash ($14): Chunks of corned beef with savory potatoes, 2 poached eggs and 4 pieces of sourdough toasted to perfection. Realy enjoyed the toast here. The portion size was fair but a little on the pricier side for a brunch item. 

Eggs Benedict ($13): Wasn't my favorite item =\/ breadding on bottom was sweet and turkey bacon was used instead of regular. Poo. I love turkey bacon but a girl's trying to get some delicious bad food in me while in Vegas!! However, the caramelized onions and potatoes were on point.

Free-Range Chicken Sandwich ($12): This dish sounds average and something you can get anywhere but my oh my. The chicken wasn't dry. The pesto, mozzarella cheese and pesto blend was beyond perfect. I tried savoring every last bite of it! YUM. I tend to lean more on brunch items during brunch hours but this dish is one to get!

All dishes were decently sized. Hipster type of atmosphere. Location is off.. it's underneath an apartment\/studio complex! Lots of metered street parking for $1\/hour. Something to try while out in Vegas!",4,2,2

It's just wholesome, fresh food done right with a comforting feel and a refreshingly hip, clean decor. An unexpected surprise that is unique for the downtown area.  

I almost always go for their short stack of buttermilk pancakes served with your own little jar of real maple syrup. Fluffy, creamy, sweet, homey goodness. Some of the best I've had. Hopefully more variation and play with the recipe in the future. 

Truffled egg sandwich is amazing. Soft fresh bread, sub style with the most decadent but lightest scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms etc. A must try. Also comes with seasoned home fries. 

Tomato salad is refreshing and light. Might just change your mind about the flavor tomatoes can posses. 

Other items to check out-Corned beef hash, biscuits with fresh strawberry compote\/ fresh fruit.

My only con would be that some menu items aren't available from time to time, maybe due to acquiring fresh product? (Paper & clipboard menu) I've also tried some other items that often miss the mark on just flavor.  

Service from the lady's is great. Always on point and genuinely attentive. Nice, knowledgeable, caring.

Finally got around to eating here on my last trip and now I'm wondering what all the fuss was about. It's good, but nothing I had made it rise to greatness. Although, to be fair I didn't exactly order the most exciting thing on the menu. 

I got eggs. Two scrambled eggs, to be exact. And they came with smoked bacon and chive potatoes and toast, which was of the rye variety. All of the above was sufficiently cooked and tasty. None of it was particularly noteworthy, though I will point out that I give props to any place serving rye bread. If they really wanted to get on my good side, they'd serve pumpernickel or squaw. 

My gf ordered something called a ""skinny jenny"" which was pretty damn good. I don't know why they give it a girly, low-cal name that makes it sound like a dish catering to women. I would have ordered one, too, if it had a moniker that sounded more unisex.

At least once a day since I visited there I've envisioned that wonderful chicken banh mi.   You've already seen my rating so you should know that this is not an unpleasant thought whatsoever.   As a matter of fact I wish I could get some sort of chip implanted in my head that would push out anything negative that entered my mindspace and replace it with the deliciousness that is this sandwich.  This is an idea I'm fairly certain I can convince at least Mark Cuban of on Shark Tank.  

When I went to eat. to eat. (ha!), I was not surprised to see it jam packed full of people.  That was one of the more disheartening things about downtown in general: it seems that most of the really good places to eat like eat. require a short wait to be seated or require social interaction to a level I'm generally not comfortable with.  Thankfully I tended to venture out to lunch on my own and its much easier to get a table or seat when you're by yourself than otherwise.  If there was ever a case to be made for not having any friends whatsoever, it's that you can get a chicken banh mi sandwich from eat. approximately 10 minutes faster than if you bring a friend.  I got seated at the bar relatively quickly after I arrived, and after perusing the menu I decided pretty quickly on the chicken banh mi because it sounded good combined with the fact I didn't think it'd offend my lactose intolerant sensibilities.

There's not much more I can add to what's probably already been said about the chicken banh mi, and allow me to steal another members perfect picture of it http:\/\/s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/dPrha-ksEnqLVmTFMc5vsQ\/l.jpg.   The flavors popped, and each and every component of it was welcomed into my mouth.   One thing I'll say is that it's not denoted with two asterisks on the menu which is code for ""spicy"", but the slaw on it did contain jalapenos and I actually found myself drinking quite a bit of their wonderful iced tea to counter this.   I LOVE spicy food and still thought it had quite a kick, so something to consider.  

Service was extremely fast and efficient, and my iced tea never came close to being empty.  Price was extremely reasonable for what I considered to be an excellent meal.

We were seated right away both times (yay) but waited at least 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence. The place isn't big at all so even if you're busy you can at least say hello to your table!

The first time, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich is ginormous and 90% bread and 10% cheese. While the cheese was yummy, you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread. Should be more cheesy in my opinion. Shrug. But to each his own. And the server gave me chips instead of potato salad. When I asked her to bring me the salad, she seemed perturbed. Geez! It was your mistake, not mine.

The second time, we waited 15 minutes to order, very frustrating. Especially when you only have an hour for lunch. I ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon. For $11 I expected something goooood. WRONG. My eggs arrived well over medium (no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in, booooo.) The potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth, and the bacon way too crispy. Guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone. 

When I asked for jam for my toast, again the server seemed hassled by my request. Is it just me? Do I have a booger on my face? I didn't ask for new eggs because I don't like to complain (nor do I risk saliva or snot in my food). Very disappointed at both of my visits.

We shared an order of biscuits with jam - which was more like dessert than an appetizer. For some reason, starting breakfast with something sugary seems to be socially acceptable. Why isn't this the case for dinner?

For my main course I had to try the shrimp 'n' grits. It's my new thing, and I've been told that the chef has some history with NOLA. As expected, the grits were buttery and bacon laden. Just how I like 'em. A very rich start to the day, indeed!

The truffled egg sandwich was good but nothing amazing. It comes with mushrooms which were pretty much non existent.Truffle flavor?? Bacon was on the chewier side which can be troublesome in a sandwich.  A decent breakfast sandwich but not worth the $12. 

Shrimp Po Boy was also alright. The best part was probably the slaw. Shrimp were fresh. The ciabatta was on the chewier side and probably could of been toasted more. Potato salad on the side was nothing special.

They were out of the corned beef hash so I got the pancakes instead with a chicken apple sausage. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast type of person ....rather savory instead. However, these pancakes were AMAZING! I hold pancakes at a high standard because of a place back home that's been around before my grandmother dined there (Liliha Bakery, Hawaii).

We were seated quickly during a holiday weekend. I like the decor with the modern lights and the greenery inside. There was a lot of personality like a typewriter in the waiting space and a wall that says, ""I'll see you in the flowers."" I appreciate the open kitchen layout. 

We shared the biscuits which came slathered in very sauce and topped with a generous portion of whole fruit: strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. We also ordered the corn beef hash. Surprisingly flavorful, it came with two perfectly poached eggs and four pieces of sourdough. The two dishes were the perfect pairing of savory and sweet. 

My only qualm: Drinks are a little pricey. $3 for coffee & $3 for an Arnold Palmer? I'm used to only paying a dollar or two for drinks, especially coffee.  The coffee here wasn't anything special but my fiance pointed out there were free refills on both drinks.

I had a flight to catch and they got me in and out in 35 minutes--which I have to say is quite commendable being they were probably 75% full on a Thursday morning. 

I ordered the corned beef hash which was quite delicious and a offered a big portion.

I first learned about Eat after taking a Downtown Project tour.  After hearing Natalie's story, I was sold on having to check out her restaurant!

So our team (a group of 5) showed up around 1pm for lunch.  We weren't in the heat of the lunch rush, but there were no tables available, so we waited about 10 minutes for a table to open up for us.

Everything on their menu looked great, and I was debating between the Grilled Cheese\/Tomato Soup and Chicken Pot Pie.  I ended going for the Chicken Pot Pie, which was amazing!  The crust was flaky, and the filling wasn't too liquidy.  The portion was great, and even came with a large side salad.  I finished most of the pot pie because it was so good, but I felt a bit guilty after (but I guess that's why it's comfort food, right?)

We started off with the Beignets, which are served with seasonal jam (here, strawberry) and a vanilla mascarpone.  The beignets themselves visibly oily and tough but the vanilla marscapone is wonderful.  The creamy texture and deep vanilla flavor matched really well with the strawberry jam. 

I'm a fan of Mexican breakfasts so I was drawn to the Juevos Montelunos.  Two over easy eggs lay atop a fried corn tortilla and an unexpected but delicious mixture of peas, fetas, and bananas with a yin\/yang coverage of a salsa roja and salsa verde.  Roasted potatoes rounded everything off.  This dish isn't truly Mexican - peas? feta instead of cotija? bananas instead of plaintain? But oddly, it does work and it's filling for a vegetarian dish.  

John's shrimp and grits with bacon was a stunner.  It was a generous portion with thick strips of bacon and plump shrimp.  The sauce on the plate was heavenly, with a spicy, savory kick and creamy grits.  He nursed a cup of the Colorado roasters coffee.  

It's a breakfast and lunch only place so the mornings are lively.  They brought in a very talented guitar player, with his spin on contemporary songs and really excellent picking skills.",3,1,2

RESTAURANT
Located a few blocks away from the Fremont Street Experience, Eat is located on Carson Street. Inside you'll notice the urban-industrial decor and potted greenery, which is always nice to see especially if you're so used to seeing brown dirt all the time. The floors are concrete and the ceiling has an unfinished appearance with its exposed pipes. I mention this because the restaurant was very noisy when I visited, so the sound was bouncing off the floor and ceiling.

FOOD
Free Range Chicken Cibatta Sandwich: Does free range chicken taste better than ones that are pumped up with steroids? I can't say for sure, but I guess I feel less guilty.  The sandwich was delicious with its melted mozzarella cheese, pesto mayo, and mixed greens. 

The sandwich can be paired with your choice of homemade potato chips or potato salad. You'll also receive  a ""really good pickle"", as stated on the menu. The potato chips were crunchy and not greasy. Both my friend and I didn't receive pickles with our meals since they were all out of them. Unfortunate since we were really looking forward to trying this supposed, ""really good pickle"" which I imagine would complement our sandwiches. 

SERVICE
Even though it was busy when my friend and I arrived, the service didn't disappoint. We received our orders fairly quickly, and if we needed anything our waiter wasn't too far from our table. 

TIPS
+ Seems like this place can get packed during lunchtime hours, so it might be best heading down here right when lunch is being served at 11:00 a.m.

+There's meter parking across the street from the restaurant, although you could just park at one of the nearby casino parking garages. 

OVERALL
I think Eat is on to something here with its fresh, delicious, healthy food that leaves you feeling good without any of the, ""I hate my life! I shouldn't have eaten that"" regrets.",7,2,4

Upon entering,  this place was small to average in size, but had several tables to accommodate the lunch crowd.  As such this made it very loud and very hard to hear the conversation I was having, but the staff was amazing and the food looked very good as the staff was hustling it out.

It took  a few minutes for us to be seated, but our waitress was spot on.  The drinks and food were out very quickly.  Our waitress was happy and up beat all while dealing with a busy lunch crowd, and never missed a beat.  

I went with a chicken sandwich, (added avocado) and the green chili pesole soup.  I was not ready for the flavor explosion that happened with each bite.  The portions size was amazing and for the price could not have been happier.  Both my lunch partners that day agreed.

My friends and I took a walk here from Fremont Street during our guy's trip to Vegas because of the great Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint.  We sat at the common table and were immediately greeted by the friendly staff.  Shortly after we sat down, a woman over-heard us talking about appetizers and immediately interrupted us to tell us we had to order the deviled-eggs.  Wow was she spot on.  The egg whites were deep-fried while the yokes were mixed with amazing-ness and put back onto the newly deep-fried egg whites.  We found out later that the woman who suggested it was the owner of the restaurant.  Turns out she knows what she's talking about.

After that I had the veggieburger which was by far the best I ever had.  I don't even know what else to say about it, just get it, or anything else on their menu.

It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was seasoned good and was presented good with scratch gravy on top with steaming hot potatoes.  The beef is chuck very well tenderized and it's a thick steak.  Tenderizing a thick steak does require a lot of pounding and I felt that the fat was pounded out of this steak, so it ended up being a bit lean and dry.  More gravy would have fixed this issue.  Sister had the truffled egg croissant.  I tried some of it and didn't get much of the truffle oil.  Bacon was crispy good and the croissant had a good flaky texture. Good service too.",1,1,1

I personally didn't enjoy the Huevos Motulenos. I found the flavors and consistencies to be contrasting. Black beans and peas were too hard, salsa didn't complement the dish, there was hardly any egg, the tortilla was soggy, and the bananas confused the entire dish. 

The beignets were really fluffy, but they would have been better if made and served fresh. They were barely warm when they got to our table. The strawberry jam was really good, though. 

The Benedict was decent. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. 

The Chicken Fried Steak was definitely the best plate. The gravy was seasoned deliciously, I just wish there was more of it. A little too much breading but it added good crunch and flavor.

Had the shrimp and grits because why not it's one of the sought after selection from foodies around. My date said it was out of this world! Hahaha. That bacon and melted cheese just topped the out of the world flavor of this dish.  I was craving for the eggs Benedict but only available on weekends. I came on a weekday to avoid the crowd and long lines. Got there when in opened and got seated right away but within minutes it was full.  I had the eggs mouloteno and it was s different flavor each bite! It was a combination of plantain, black beans, salsa, sweet sausage with eggs on top over easy. I finished the whole thing except for the potatoes with it. Also ordered the biscuits pancake, which was so so, just a bit of moist to it would have been perfect. The brew was so good I had to have two cups. 

The place was clean and server was friendly and came with great recommendations. They always came to check up on us which was great. Would highly recommend this place for great food and the location was definitely out of your ordinary Vegas strip. It was a bit of nostalgia of the Bugsy side of Vegas.",1,1,1

We were so excited to finally try this place and had high hopes. We were a party of 13 and were told it would be an hour and 1\/2. An hour and 1\/2 seemed long but based on our party we accepted it and agreed to wait. We asked the hostess to take our number as we had 7 kids and wanted to let them play at the Container Park. The hostess agreed and said she would call us. About an hour and 15 min later we called to make sure things were on time. At that time I talked to a man who said they were running behind and it would be at LEAST 45 more minutes. This was VERY frustrating- not only would this be a 2 hour wait, it was 110 degrees we had 7 hungry kids AND they had our phone number and never called to tell us they were running behind. What ever happened to a professional courtesy or just good business practices.. We tried to wait and eventually 30 minutes later ended up down the road at La Comida. Later our friend called, talked to a manger who basically told her it wasn't their policy to ""call"" people because people ""like her"" usually don't answer their phones!!! Needless to say she was quite offended. We waited by the phone and were not ""those people""! He then said they opened at 8:00 tomorrow if we wanted to come back. He said he wasn't prepared to offer anything for the inconvenience. Overall pretty bad experience and I don't think we will give them another chance. Get it together EAT!!!",2,0,0

I came here with my husband at around 11:00 on a weekday and easily found metered street parking.  When we walked it we were greeted warmly by staff and seated within five minutes.  I love the hip atmosphere and decorations.  It was such a fun environment to be in and you could see the owner going around to tables and meeting with customers.
 
Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs so these three dishes were way too much for us, but Yay for yummy left overs later!  Here is what we ordered:

Chilaquiles scrambled eggs - The sausage on this dish was savory and sweet and amazing.  The sausage was my favorite part of the dish.  The meat was halved and rested on a bead of eggs, cheese, salsa, and chips.  The salsa wasn't my favorite because it was a bit to smokey in flavoring for my taste.  Overall it wasn't a bad dish, but I'll likely explore other things on the menu before in re-order this dish.

Truffled egg sandwich - I can totally see why this dish is so popular on Yelp.  It was amazing!  The eggs, the bacon (and I'm not even a bacon person, the ciabatta bread, and the potatoes.  I highly recommend this for first times to eat.  It will definitely be a great introduction to the food at eat.

Short Stack - The best pancakes I have ever had.  They were super thick and fluffy and mind blowing.  A short stack comes with two 1\/2 inch pancakes, topped with lots of powdered sugar, with jarred maple syrup on the side.  If you have a sweet tooth this is a must!!!

When friends and family come and visit in the future, I will definitely bring them here for brunch.",2,2,2

While one can always grab lunch or breakfast in any of the casinos along Fremont Street, there's nothing hip, upbeat with an amazing menu & great service like EAT of downtown Las Vegas.  After being born and raised in larger metropolitan cities, my favorite dining places are always the ones that are the hole in the wall locations where they are the true gems, best kept secrets and where you normally can only find them via word of mouth. 

EAT is one of those places. It's located on a corner building, simple, intimate setting yet with the hip, vibe and groovy culture of downtown.

For breakfast, try the Truffle Egg Sandwich, Mediterranean Egg White Fritatta and I'd say the BEST (made to order) Beignets west of New Orleans' Cafe Du Monde original.  Yummm!!!

Corn beef hash: The best part of the meal. The corn beef was so tender and tasty. It comes with a poached egg, but I went scrambled bc in that person. The accompanying toast is hella good. So fluffy and thick. 

Shrimp and grits: My brunch companion ordered this and loved it. I'm personally not a shrimp gal, but I trust his recommendation. 

A-la-carte Pancake: Effffff this pancake was divine. So thick and fluffy and doughy all at the same time. I could live on this pancake. We asked for some strawberry jam to go with. Do that.

Other highlights of the meal included the coffee- a delightful bold blend with almond milk and raw sugar available! 

Justin really wanted to try the chicken fried steak (which they stop serving exactly at 11am) so we ended up here for brunch on day 2 also!

eat. has been on my radar forever, but they don't fit into my work schedule since they only serve breakfast brunch. It's in a cute space downtown where you'll find a wide variety of patrons.

Our server was so blah. He was super rude when he walked up to us and asked us rather rudely what we wanted. I want to say it was a , ""know what you want?"" No hi or anything. I really hate patronizing places with bad customer service but I whatever, I paid for metered parking. lol jk he also brought us one refill on our drink. When we were paying. Enough about that.

My food was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't drool worthy. It was picture worthy though.

We got the deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, and the Reuben with tomato soup. We got their house brewed citrus tea.

The shrimp and grits was good. The bacon makes the dish. I wish the grits were thicker and more flavorful. It was good and the portion of shrimp was good.

The Reuben sandwich had the thickest slices of bread. The meat was okay. It was all just okay.

The tomato soup was good, but not special. Just a well done basic tomato soup.

The tea was good.

The deviled eggs were good. Deep fried hard boiled egg whites then filled with the traditional deviled egg filling and topped with bacon. I could have eaten a dozen of these.

Overall I liked the place. After hyping myself up for months I'd probably not rush back. The service was disappointing, the food wasn't memorable or special, and the cheap tactics of using the huge bread slices was a turn off.",5,2,3

So I thought the storefront looked odd and when i drove by it, the restaurant is underneath either a motel or a bunch of apartments which was even more odd because they were kind of run down.

So i parked in the metered parking across the street and ran across to check this place out. When you actually walk, its like you're in a different part of town. Inside its clean and new and actually ....nice? Like hipster nice. It was definitely a surprise.

I sat at the bar and yelp told me to get Huevos Motulenos so i ordered the Huevos Motulenos.

Which are awesome. There is so much texture and flavor going on in that plate that its really hard to describe.

It was definitely one of the best breakfasts that i've eaten recently. And because i knew that i wasn't eating anything for a while i ordered a side of pancakes which i thought would be the size of my hand. They weren't. They were the size of my head. So i barely made it out of there alive but i powered it all down like a champ.

On a side note, i don't know why people go to restaurants like this and just order bacon and eggs and then say ""wtf bacon and eggs. I mean..it tastes like bacon and eggs - i can make this at home. What a rip off."" If you just want to have a crappy meal like two strips of bacon and an egg, learn to cook and stay home. Go get a 99 cent breakfast burrito from mcdonals or whatever. Don't come in here and wonder why bacon and eggs at a restaurant tasted like bacon and eggs made by everybody everywhere EVER.

I would definitely come back to eat here again.",3,4,2

Eat is decorated beautifully. It is rustic and urban and modern and east coast meets west coast all at the same time. Brick walls and simple art and a few rustic wooden tables and I'm in love. One star for ambiance\/decor. 

We sat down and our waiter came by to take our drink order. He wasn't very nice and had this look on his face like ""I can't wait to walk away from this table and I couldn't be less interested in what you want to drink."" The drink prices are a little ridiculous. Grandma ordered tea: $4 for a cup? And $3 for a soda? Hmmm...

Also, they DO NOT have bottled water. I don't understand this. My mom tried to order bottled water and the rude waiter just said ""we don't have that."" I asked if their water was at least filtered and he said ""well, it's not tap water but it comes from a fountain."" ::blankstare:: What does that even mean? We ordered a glass anyway and it definitely tasted like Vegas tap water. Mom ordered coffee instead and believe it or not, the coffee tasted stale. 

I ordered the DWBLT. It was DELICIOUS. I'd give 5 stars just for this sandwich if it weren't for the shitty service and awkwardly unhappy waiter. It came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough (but it actually tasted more like lightly fried bread?). The flavors were amazing and the bread was soft, but crispy. Also, the bacon was out-of-this-world good. The sandwich was oozing with freshness and definitely one of the best BLTs I've ever had! It came with homemade potato chips which were pretty good too. 

My grandma had the chicken caesar salad. She seemed to enjoy it. Mom ordered the chicken sandwich and she loved it. She got potato salad with her sandwich. I took a bite and it was pretty good - not as good as the DWBLT though! 


Before we were even finished eating and before our table was cleared, a waiter who wasn't ours walked by and placed our check on the table. I REALLY hate when this happens. I didn't ask for the check yet and it makes me feel rushed. And, how do you know I didn't want to order something else?

Ordered the huevos and fried steak dishes. Both were delicious. Their huevos dish has bananas in it and wasn't too spicy with both of the sauces. The steak was delicious and the fried breading and gravy made it even better. The sourdough toast was sick!

They have fresh squeezed oj here. It isn't squeezed on-site, but is fresh squeezed not from concentrate.

On a Saturday morning I get a text from my friend who says he just flew in and the people he was supposed to hang out with on the Strip are all hungover and sleeping still, so my husband and I swoop him up from his hotel and suggest eat. since we wanted to show him the downtown area. The location itself is very unique and just walking distance from Container Parker. Being from SF\/Bay Area, we're all used to extremely long waits for brunches, so eat.'s 20 minute wait was no big deal. Once we finally got seated, the 3 of us ended up in a 2-top that was in a corner. It was very.. cozy, but what's a little bit of discomfort among friends? The hostess was very sweet and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long, so I appreciated that. We ordered the corned beef, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and pancakes for the table. The pancakes were mouth-watering, and probably the best part of the meal, but one of the servers did give me grief about asking for more syrup (I swear the dinky little serving they give isn't enough!) My friend ate all of his corned beef, so he had no complaints; however, my husband hated his chicken fried steak with a passion. It was very tough - just looking at it you could tell it was completely dry and devoid of flavor. He left a large chunk of it uneaten and didn't bother taking it home. Since we didn't have that much room on the table, I wasn't really feeling my eggs benedict, so I placed it behind me in the booth and stuck to my pancakes. As other people have experienced, waiters are somewhat hard to track down. Someone who wasn't our waiter asked me if I was done with my benedict plate and if he could take it away. It was barely touched, so I'm surprised he didn't ask what was wrong and didn't ask if I wanted to take it to go (my husband eventually ate it at home to make up for his lack of a meal). Maybe we should have ordered a few different items like the truffled egg sandwich, but my husband probably would never want to come back here. I came here wishing that we had spent our morning eating at Mr. Mama's since I haven't been there yet. Hopefully that place doesn't disappoint.

We were seated immediately and ordered coffee. The coffee arrived after a short wait and upon arrival our server thanked us for our patience beause the coffee was being brewed fresh. It was worth the short wait. The menu is interesting and has many inviting choices. I decided on the Chilaquiles which was excellent. This may be a new breakfast item as I have not seen it reviewed. The plate starts wich a layer of corn tortilla chips, covered with melted cheese and red & green chiles topped with scrambled eggs, a jalapeno sausage and pico de gallo.

There are a LOT of great options in Vegas for a hearty breakfast\/brunch, so it's not easy to find a place that really impresses. But Eat managed to serve up some ungodly portions of delicious breakfast food, with a level of quality and execution that was nearly flawless. Let's start with my country fried steak, which was fried to a beautiful crisp, while maintaining a nicely tender center. Matched with chunks of thick gravy and streaks of the runny egg yolk, each bite was beautifully savory and satisfying. The corned beef hash with eggs and toast was equally generous in portion, and came nicely seasoned with an appropriate ratio of potatoes. Each dish was hearty and flavorful, without being overly greasy or heavy.

As equally as impressive as the food, was the organization and execution coming from the kitchen. We sat at the counter and was able to observe how Chef Natalie was constantly hustling and communicating with her staff. They were like a well oiled machine, and it was both impressive and refreshing to see someone that on top of everything coming out of the kitchen. It's no wonder that the food came out promptly, was prepared well, and tasted great.

So if you're looking for a nice little breakfast spot that serves up some creative dishes with quality ingredients and generous portions, come eat at Eat. At the very least, you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that your food was prepared with some attention and care. And that's actually worth something to me.",7,4,4

It was 1 pm (an hour before they close) and raining outside and we were told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes.  I anticipated this, brought an umbrella, and my husband and his son ran down to check out the famous O-Face Donuts (win-win as I would now have three places checked off on my Yelp bucket list!).  Near the half-hour mark, the hostess came outside and told me it would not be much longer and offered the counter but I declined.  There was room to wait inside so I went in.  Two people came  in and they were almost immediately taken to a table (albeit by a different hostess\/staff) which did irritate me as we were now hitting the 40 minute mark.  The other hostess returned and must have noticed what had occurred and told me we would have a table right away (and I did see her talk to the other server).  

We sat down (with our O-Face donut loot ).  Our server came over and took our drink order.  He was friendly but he did appear to be slightly ready to be"" done"" (it was now very close to 2 pm) for the day (and I completely sympathize with that).  We quickly made up our minds; Killer grilled cheese with kick-ass tomato soup for moi; pancakes with bacon (a substitute for the apple-chicken sausage) for my step-son; corned beef hash for my husband.  It did not seem very long before our food was served but gave us time to take in the decor.  I loved it- especially the tall divider structure at the entrance with the plants (figuring out how to do that at home).   My husbands only minor (very minor) complaint was the chair that he sat in seemed to have a hollow cushion and it caused him to be seated at an awkward height (but it was worse when I sat in it as I'm much shorter!) but not enough to dampen his appetite or our total experience.  The food arrived and it looked wonderful.  My husband loved the corned beef hash (its his baseline food item order to which all places are measured by).  He determined it to be in 2nd place to Bagel Cafe (a very high compliment)- but it could be ""in the running"".  I enjoyed my grilled cheese very much but the soup slightly reminded me of marinara sauce (not necessarily a bad thing but I couldn't get that out of my mind). My step-son really liked his pancakes and bacon and could not finish it and offered us a bite.  THOSE PANCAKES!  Not sure what is in them but they were incredible!  I had to have another bite!  

I'm not sure when we will venture out again( but I am dying to try on a week-day as the menu seems to slightly vary) but we definitely agreed that we would want to come back.  This is a place that every Las Vegan should try at least once!",2,2,2

True, this part of Las Vegas isn't part of the Strip and it doesn't have the frills of big hotels and casinos - but that's the beauty of Downtown. I love that the restaurants around here still carries the vibe of old Las Vegas. 

Eat is no exception - it's located on the corner of an old apartment complex. The decor is very unpretentious nor is it trying to be hipster. It's very clean with an open kitchen concept. The staff is friendly and so is the owner, Natalie. 

We came here on a Sunday morning, expecting a long wait. I guess we came at a perfect time because everyone else must have been asleep or something coz there was no line at all. The bar counter had seats available which was perfect coz that's where we preferred to sit anyway. 

We ordered the Corned Beef Hash, the Strawberry Biscuits and BLT with tomato salad.  The corned beef was really good - just the right balance of saltiness and it was also quite tender. Also I liked that it didn't have too much potatoes. I could also tell that they source their bread from a good purveyor coz I loved how their sour dough tasted. I took a bite of my friend's BLT - delish!  And I'm finicky about the coffee in breakfast places coz 8 out 10 places don't serve good coffee. This place certainly cares about the coffee they serve their patrons. Love their coffee!  I take mine decaf - but it was still full bodied. It's really good, they even have them in packages for people to buy!

Reviewers complaining about the prices being high - I don't really care about that. I would much rather spend money on good food than waste a few dollars on lousy food. This place doesn't take shortcuts on preparing their food and the ingredients that they use. And that takes money hence the price is reflective of that. Now if they charged high and served crappy food, that's another story. 

This place is certainly worth my money. I shall be back.",0,0,0

My first time here and damn was it good.  A really nice place with some really amped up comfort food.  My dish, the Chicken fried steak with potatoes was very memorable.  The way they make their potatoes really took it beyond the standard breakfast potato from most places.  The potatoes are cooked perfectly and have this nice, light char on them that adds an extra depth of flavor.  Also mixed in with the potatoes are highly caramelized pieces of onion and garlic, adding even more flavor to the mix.  So damn tasty.  The chicken fried steak was super crispy on the outside with a gravy that was creamy and spicy.  I would love a big bowl of gravy by itself and eat it like a stew.  The portion was also pretty huge so it could easily make two meals (or just one meal for someone like me.)

My friend, who's a vegetarian, ordered the truffle egg sandwich which also looked good.  I didn't try it but he said he liked it.  Actually, his sandwich comes with bacon so I got to have that so I did get to try something off his dish.  The bacon was good. :)

One thing I want to try on the next visit are the pancakes.  The table next to us ordered this and those are the thickest pancakes I've ever seen, they were an inch thick each! They looked super fluffy and has some chicken\/apple sausage with it.  Next time for sure.

Another cool spot in the middle-of-being-revitalized downtown area.",9,3,8

I was disappointed that they have a somewhat limited bfast menu during the week (no eggs benedict) and they discontinued the beignets, which were the two things I specifically came for, thus the docked star.

The coffee was good and they have Truvia which is a def plus. I got the truffled egg sandwich, which was surprisingly bland for $12 and could have used some cheese or something for flavor. I made my own concoction of syrup and tabasco, which I know sounds completely weird, but is absolutely delicious! The chive potatoes were also a little too much on the greasy side for my liking.

The stars of the morning bfast show were the cinnamon butter strawberry compote biscuits, which were amazing if not pricey @$8 for four. Maybe it was the fresh blackberries?

I live in the downtown area and was thrilled when I heard this Eat was opening.  I had been thinking about going for weeks... finally I made my way down to eat.  

When we arrived it was about 1pm... they close at 2 now, but by the way everyone was paced it seemed as if they were already trying to close.  There were about 10 people in the place.  It is clean and nicely decorated. There were two hipster girls that were running food and drinks back and forth.  Girl 1 gave us our seat and menu.  Girl 2 brought us water. Girl one came to take our drink order... Coke, coffee... Girl 2 brought them out, and said the creamer was coming. Girl 1 came by to take order... I tried to order pancakes because I saw them on the sides menu, but they stop with breakfast at 11 so I  ordered the veggie chili, and my bf ordered the free range chicken sandwich. I asked for honey as girl one was walking away but said sure... she came back with creamer. I asked again.

I received a big bowl with a corn tortilla, it had flavor of spice and chicken... I didn't think this is was I ordered... my bf was not very pleased with his sandwich.  It was bland and was dripping water with every bite. The chips were greasy and soggy... Girl 2 came by and dropped off the check by conveniently placing it on the table so that my bf had to move his arm to make way for the bill.  LOL.  He moved it to the center of the table and I picked it up and said, ""no, no, it belongs under your elbow, put it back.""  Geez... thinking that I has not received what I ordered because I noticed there was chicken in it, I checked the bill.  It said Pasole.  Good thing I am not a vegetarian anymore... I would have been furious.  I notified Girl 2.  She apologized and said I wouldn't have to pay for the pasole... and would get me some chili. How very kind.  Girl 1 came back inquiring.  I told her I thought I ordered chili. ""Oh you wanted the BLACK BEAN chili.""  She left.  Girl 2 came back and said, ""sorry the pasole is green chili pasole and so they are often confused.""  I asked her to take this plate away. 

Note to yelp: If you are vegetarian, and want to order the veggie chile make sure you say black bean very clearly this way you don't accidentally take a bite of their chicken pasole.  

My chili came out... it was cold. There was no slice of corn bread or crackers.  Just plain chili, by then my bf was done eating and I wasn't hungry anymore... I got it to go.  They brought me a to coffee cup... I threw my chili in there... we paid for it and went on about our day.

PS.  I know I am a bit of a foodie and have given a few other restaurants downtown low reviews.  My hope is that they will improve and meet a higher standard making the downtown community a great place to live, work and eat.",2,0,0

Location - eat. is in the heart of DTLV, right next to Container Park. Easy walking distance from the DTLV Hotels and Fremont St. If you drive, there is an ample amount of street parking for $1\/hour.

I have never heard of a restaurant refusing to serve during their stated hours of operation. I really would have expected a small restaurant to care more about their customers, and they just lost their opportunity for any of my business.

I had the truffled egg sandwich which was omg good!  It is served with wild mushrooms, chives, feta cheese, and potatoes on ciabatta bread.  It was delicious.  It is like an elegant farm breakfast sandwich.

I had the pancakes, they were light, fluffy, and delicious. The iced tea was very nice and the staff were courteous. It's also clean and attractive inside, metered parking outside.

I came in solo and wanted to sit near a window to enjoy the morning sun. Large windows with tables at them surrounded the dinning area. But they were tables for four and I was solo. But the whole place was 70% empty, there were 5-6 of these 'window' tables, and when I came in they were all EMPTY. All the patrons were either at the counter or crowded together in a dark pit-like seating area in the center. So despite my asking nicely they denied me a seat at the window.

I can understand saving those tables to accommodate parties of four when the place is busy, but if a customer wants to be seated at a window, you should just seat them there.

I hope the management rads this a makes some changes. It really does seem a nice place to eat, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with this seating nonsense.",1,0,0

Was completely ignored.
Another group came in seconds right after us, asked for a seat of 5, was immediately seated.
Two of my other coworkers came in, asked again for a party of 5.. Again to remind you, there were 4 of us at the time because we were waiting on the doctor to arrive! 
We were immediately rejected and told that she cannot seat incomplete parties.

First, food and drink. My wife was accidentally brought an iced tea instead of coffee. That turned out to be a good thing, because the iced tea is awesome - I ended up drinking more of it than the pop that I actually ordered.

After a bit of a wait after ordering (the place was almost at capacity but there were a handful of tables free), our breakfast arrived - beignets for my wife and chicken fried steak for me. The beignets were good if a bit doughy. My wife said they were better with the jam. I assume they're made from Café du Monde mix since there's a box of it on display behind the counter - I'd rather see them make them in-house.

We both thoroughly enjoyed the sourdough buttered toast, eggs and ""smashed"" potatoes that came with my chicken fried steak. The gravy was more flavorful than other places I've had it (which is a lot - I'm on a kick for it lately), and the meat was obviously freshly breaded. But, it was really quite tough! Whomever is back there making it needs to smack it with the tenderizer a LOT more. A LOT MORE. BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF IT. SERIOUSLY.

At the end of our meal, we got to talk to Chef Nat personally and hear about her plans for eat's expansion - including the dog-friendly patio outside!

For me, the experience was more like 3.5 stars - but I'll round up! It's on the high end of ""good"" with lots of potential to be great. eat doesn't need Downtown Project's money to prop it up - it's strong enough to stand on its own.

I had no idea that this place was purely a breakfast and lunch joint, tucked away in old downtown Las Vegas.  You can find Eat on the first floor of a small apartment complex where the area has been sprawling into an art district.  I only could find street meter parking, so if anyone else knows of any other parking options, do tell.

As I walked in, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I heard of this place from Anne, who is an amazing foodie expert that is not on Yelp and I been trying to proselytize her since.  The last thing I remember her saying is that they had an enjoyable experience except for the fact that the owner gave everyone a hard time about splitting costs between multiple debit\/credit cards.  Other than that, she rated the experience a 3\/4.  I was expecting more of a southern fusion breakfast lunch place.  Boy was I surprised to learn that this place is a trendy and modern eatery.

I was solo dolo so was seated at the counter.  Staff was friendly, but I already had my guard up waiting for the owner, whom I never ran into at all.  I still won't judge character based on anything but my own assessment, so was eager to meet her.  Maybe next time.

At the counter, I asked the nice girl across the counter what was good and she recommended the range free chicken sandwich topped with arugula, tomoatos, basil mayo and paired with a dill pickle and potato salad.  The Potato salad was one of the better ones I tried that ain't homemade.  The sandwich was delicious, but a bit drippy.  Still very tasty and I am a huge fan of arugula so you already know.  It was hot off the press and went well with my fresh (bottled) ginger ale by Bruce Cost.  A hint of spicy notes got my tongue's attention, but $4 is much for an 11.5 oz. beverage.

I love the decor which provided a hip yet serious look reminiscent of bustling citified diners in larger metropolitan areas like Seatown, Frisco, LA, Diego, etc.  Something I find foreign in LV and glad to see it finally arrived.

I can't wait to try other menu items and anticipating the next time I can share the experience with friends and fam.  I recommend y'all check this out if you are visiting or just hungry...a great representative of the LV foodie scene!",4,0,1

We proceeded to order appetizers; which were an order of deviled eggs, and tomato soup. Then ordered our entrees which were corned beef and hash, and the reuben sandwich.

The Coffee we ordered was horrible, bitter, tasteless, just burnt. We couldn't even finish a cup of coffee and usually, we have 3 or 4 cups each. 

20 Minutes later we got our appetizers, AND our entrees at the same time. Not only did we make it clear during the ordering process, we figured the server knew we wanted to start with the STARTERS, and after the starters are finished, typically you get your entrees then.
The Tomato soup was so sour, it was inedible. The Corned Beef and Hash, not only did it not look fresh, but was cold. The Reuben sandwich, not only was the ratio of meat to bread ridiculous, but the meat was very dry and flavorless. The potato salad it came with was ice cold, and bland.

I had the golden pancake and it was so good. Soft and cake like inside and crispy on the outside. I also ordered a side of chicken sausage and coffee. People raved about the coffee it was ok. But as I saw orders being sent out one that stood out I saw pancakes with a deep fried egg on top. So I asked our server about it and she said that was today's special or secret menu. Also listed other items on certain days. Umm Hello I didn't know this you didn't mention this when we sat down. You should have told us about the specials that were not on the menu ugh!!!!!

We went here for our friend Lisa's birthday and celebration of her pregnancy. We brought a bundt cake that we thought we could bring to the restaurant\/table, but to our surprise THIS WAS A NO GO! They said that it was health code and that it could be a possible infraction and what not. I was actually kind of impressed by that. They really do care about the well being of their restaurant and they really stuck to it. 
   I want to say that the place is SUPER CLEAN. Like my moms house clean lol. I'm a clean freak so this was exactly what I like. Everyone inside seemed to be loving their visit here. We had too many brunch club members with us so they gave us a private dining section outside, which was amazing. It was like a feel good picnic table received just for us. A+++
   Our server was so freaking nice, I loved her! I didnt catch her name but Im sure MGMT knows who I'm talking about. We had two little ones with us and they were running a muck and causing havoc but she still kept her cool. 
   The food came out at a good speed even with the 10 people we had. I had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It was delicious. First I may have thought that there was too much bread (too thick of bread) but when I bit into it I fell into a limbo of cheese butter and bread that someone had to snap me out of it. The tomato soup was good even though I do prefer mine to be a little thicker or heavier. The real highlight of the meal was the Veggie Burger our photographer had. I had a bite of it and thought maybe going Vegan wouldn't be so bad if I came here every morning! Haha!
   Overall the place is a success and the food is astonishing by look, and as tasty as it looks. Don't sleep on ""EAT DTLV!""

Most of the produce here comes from local farmers markets. Very clean inside with a great atmosphere and crowd. Not obnoxious like some of the hotel restaurants. The service was good. We came for breakfast and had the the truffle egg sandwich. It was amazing. So freaking good. Potatoes it came with were very good too. we also had a free range chicken sandwich which was very good. The table next to us got a stack of pancakes which looked amazing. I will have to try them next time. It was refreshing to get off the strip and this was a nice trendy new restaurant in old town Las Vegas. The owner was outside when we arrived. She is very friendly. We will definitely be back to this hipster spot on out next Vegas trip.,0,0,0

Without hesitation he said, ""Dude, you have to go downtown and try this place called Eat. I've only been there once, but it was one of the best breakfast I ever had."" Well who was I to argue with the hotel valet, so I jumped in the car and headed right over there for breakfast.

I will say this, it's located in a sort of seedy part of town, but you shouldn't let that stop you. There is no free parking, but they do have pay per space on the street, and it only cost me a buck, so no harm or foul there.

The restaurant itself has a really cool, casual, hip vibe to it. Almost like one of those little boutique coffee shops. The staff was all very friendly, and eager to make suggestions. I started out with a cup of coffee, which was really amazing. I mean I didn't ask where the coffee came from, but I'm pretty sure it was some Latin dude with a burro bringing the beans in fresh.

I usually try to get a combo plate to get a feel for the restaurant, but the combo plate that they had didn't have any sort of pancakes with it, so I asked the waiter what I should get. He recommended getting the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote if I was looking for something sweet and yummy. And of course, my usual glass of milk to test the serving skills of the staff. 

Those biscuits? Oh my God, he was absolutely right! These amazing fresh hot little cinnamon biscuits smothered in strawberry compote with fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries, tasted like they were delivered Straight from Heaven itself!

The food was delivered to my table,  buy another one of the servers. And there was no milk. Two seconds later,  my original server shows up with my glass of milk. And there was no milk. Two seconds later, my original server shows up with my glass of milk. Another amazing save by the wait staff! 

The eggs were really good, scrambled just the way I like them, their home style hash browns were really tasty and spiced well, but the real star of this plate was the Applewood smoked bacon. Like I mean this stuff tasted like it just came out of the smoker this morning. I would have seriously ordered three more plates of it, but I didn't want to look like a total hog.

I was pleased to get the recommendation to come here, which got us away from the overstimulating nausea of the strip and get a little local flavor. The place has a very down home and uncomplicated industrial\/ modern chic vibe set on the edge of redevelopment zone of downtown. 

First off, I was bummed that we had just missed breakfast (stops at 11) and was not that intrigued by the lunch menu. We were completely caught off guard that we had several different servers within a matter of minutes when the dining room wasn't that busy. Then there were a few snafu's in that my gf got the served wrong side dish and I a chicken Banh Mi when I ordered the Tofu. 

The food itself was uneven. The chips were a highlight. The Banh Mi was fine. Potato salad was too creamy. My gf's chicken (on the chicken sandwich) seemed boiled and lacked any real flavor. She rarely complains about food. 

I am hoping that there are some jitters that need to be settled with both staff and kitchen and that it will be here the next time I come. I would love to see it improve and thrive, but for now, it was really missing the mark.",1,0,0

Pros: awesome coffee in the mornings, nice atmosphere and decor, great homemade chips, delicious grilled-cheese sandwich, and a freaking amazing tofu banh mi (seriously...that was one of my favorite things there).

Cons: the ""spicy"" posole was disappointingly bland to my palette (perhaps an off-day?), the breakfast dish with the tortilla chips (name of which is escaping me and apparently the website is down so I can't check) was tasty but ultimately muddled in flavor.

Probably the most frustrating thing (and the one that still sticks in my craw) was the day I grabbed a salad to go. I got the spinach salad with aspragus and almonds, and decided to add some shrimp. I saw that the shrimp add-on was kind of spendy (~$4), and ultimately the salad cost me $18. When I got to the office I was disappointed to find a tiny salad and three tiny shrimp. That's more than $1\/shrimp!

once we were seated we were given menus which included breakfast items.  based on this, and the fact that they are only open until 3, i expected that breakfast was available all day.  wrong.  

i ended up ordering the chicken sandwich with house made chips.  it was excellent.  the chicken was perfectly cooked and garnished with fresh veggies, melted mozzarella and a well balanced pesto mayo.  the cibatta bread was chewy, buttery and absolutely fresh.  truly one of the better sandwiches i've ever eaten. even the pickle was excellent.  the chips were equally good.  i half expected them to be like the nasty chips most average places serve.  they're not.  obviously they slice them in house, cook them perfectly and season them with good salt and maybe a little parm. 

my only other quibble is that the server tried to take my plate before i was finished.  looking forward to getting there a little earlier next time so i can try the breakfast.

I was really hoping my excited anticipation wasn't setting me up for disappointment. Located at 7th and Carson, this delight of a dining establishment is part of what is rapidly becoming a revitalized downtown and put off a trendy and hip vibe. I was anxious to read all about the chicken fried steak, but much to my dismay, it was not on the menu. What now? I had my heart set on CFS. No worries. They still have it. You just have to ask. It was, up to this point, the best chicken fried steak I've had in Vegas. It had a flavor like no other, and I have yet to figure out what it was. The tender, tasty meat was surrounded by the ultimate breading. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the eggs, well, they were just eggs. However, there is something they do with a pancake that words cannot do justice. Thick and hearty, with just enough crispiness around the edges. The service was friendly and attentive, with the beverages kept at the optimum level for consumption during the meal. Our party was split down the middle on the coffee.

Anyway, I went in with my coworkers - we were a group of six - and we only waited about five minutes to be seated. My coworker and I split the made-to-order beignets with seasonal jam & vanilla-scented mascarpone ($8). Anyone who knows me knows that I am usually against mixing fruit with food (yogurt parfaits, orange-infused anything, etc.) - the only thing I usually like is toast with jam. So honestly I was a bit worried about this because it was topped with berries, but I devoured it haha. The beignets were definitely made to order; fresh, fluffy, and cooked just right. The mascarpone wasn't too sweet or too thick. It had the texture of slightly melted jelly.

As an entree I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy (sauteed shrimp, shredded napa cabbage, seasonal winter veggies & Tabasco mayo on ciabatta - $13). It had a good amount of spice on it though I could've handled more. The shrimp was fresh, the cabbage was perfect, and I usually do not like sweet pickles but they worked on this sandwich. All sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, with a pickle. I opted for the chips and they were some of the best I've had. They had the flakiness and crispness of a lay's chip, except cooked better and minus all the greasiness. 

So, all together we ordered three ""appetizers,"" six entrees, two coffees and a tea for a total of $112. That's not bad considering it's only $20\/person. We got less at Carson's Kitchen yet spent more.

There was a little bit of a wait, but luckily we were waiting inside with a little air conditioning to keep us alive. While we were waiting we looked at the menu which was small and focused on a few varied crafted objects. 

The place has a polished concrete floor. It has a modern factory look. However, something I thought was really cheesy was seeing someone's journal or notes posted all over the place. This was posted on a wall, taking up the space of the whole wall going on about some nonsense about seeing a flower or something. Here is where they were trying too hard to be cool. Another unnecessary decoration thing was the separate large bows for sides. This had a dramatic effect, but was awful when it came to actually eating the food. 

I got the spin off a BLT. The bread reminded me of Texas Toast without the cheese. It was cut in very thick slices and was grilled on either side. When eating it, I felt it was a little too greasy because there was too much oil added to the bread. The sandwich had bacon, lettuce, tomato, and something else... I can't quite remember.

The place is still the same charming location from last time.  I really like the color scheme: medium tones of green and white.  Looks retro, clean and modern at the same time.  Seating includes a bar top, tables and booths.  Lots of space, but it packs up!  We ended up waiting about 15 minutes, but don't leave!  It's worth it :)

For this lunch date, I decided to try the Free Range Chicken sandwich for $12.  My side was the popular potato salad and chips combo from last time.  Homemade chips, lightly seasoned and homemade potato salad, this time super flavorful, was a great combination.  The sandwich is free range chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomato, mixed greens, sprouts, pesto mayo on a ciabatta bread.  Let's talk about the star of the show, the chicken.  These were breast meat chickens, so tender, so flavorful, so perfectly cooked!  LOVED IT :) mozzarella melted on the top of the chicken cloaked over and brought a lightly salted element.  The veggies offered lots of fresh texture to the meal and of course, the pesto mayo sealed the deal!  Such a great sandwich and really made my day!!

Alright, this was the dish that made me say, ""I've gotta come back real soon.""  No joke, this sandwich is awesome!  I also love the staff and got to meet the owner of the place. She's lovely and has done some great work with this joint.  Come check them out!!",4,2,4

How dare you charge so little for quality that high.
How dare you take everything I've ever known about breakfast\/brunch and obliterate it.
How f**king dare you drop a nuke on my entire world!!!

All jokes aside, I had the corned beef hash and it was amazing!! That's not even a strong enough word, honestly. My wife had the truffled egg sandwich, and I couldn't even describe the beautiful flavor in English. Everything was very well spiced and bold without it being akin to get hit in the face by a car. 

Either one of those dishes will leave you a blubbering idiot with no command of the spoken word.

Well done eat!!!",2,3,1

I had my grandparents with me and truth be told, they hated the setting and felt a bit out of place but when the food came, their tune changed. I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and Tomato soup. Lovely flavor, would have preferred if it was actually hot though. I understand that restaurants get busy, but really? It's soup. Luckily, it was super tasty so I didn't stay annoyed for too long. But again, the staff was super friendly and were very speedy with recovery when part of my order managed to get lost. All around, the meal my family and I had here was pretty damn good. We all took turns trying each other's food. The chicken pozole was tasty, the corned beef with poached eggs was insane, the menus were short and to the point and it really is a beautiful setting in a kinda blah part of town. If you come here, you'll have a great meal and maybe you can flirt with the server with the amazing beard. (Seriously, he was so good looking it was distracting) I'll definitely be back.

Some passengers on our flight had the same idea, because when we were finally seated after waiting a few, the couple next to us was from our very same flight! How cool! Small world! 

Based on some reviews I had read, we ordered the Shrimp and Grits and Huevos Motuleños. I've never had Shrimp and Grits before, so this first experience will forever be ingrained in my memory as ""holy o-m-g, where have you been all my life. How do I recreate you at home so I can eat you all day long???"" The shrimp was tasty, however, a tiny bit chewy. The bacon and tomato water mixture was heavenly. I love tomato. Yum. The cheesy grits were delicious and savory. So so so good! I didn't want to give it up, but I sacrificed it so I could swap plates and eat half of the Huevos Motuleños. I thought the flavors of this dish were interesting, but good. A nice combination of tortillas, eggs, black beans and cheese plus special sauce. The sauce was not something I was used to...a little sweet mixed with a lot of savory. Overall, I would definitely return for Shrimp and Grits and try those ""so fluffy I could die!"" pancakes.

We visited this place twice recently, once on a Tuesday morning, which was a five star visit, and then once on Saturday, which was a one and a half star experience, so I am averaging them out. Our first visit was in a large group, with four adults and three boisterous children, the waiter was unperturbed by our large group and we were seated pretty quickly at the communal table. I had the veggie burger, which was more of a large toasted sandwich of indescribable deliciousness, and an orange juice which, although ""regular"" in size was large and pulp free and quite wonderful. One of our friends had the shrimp & grits dish which she absolutely loved as well. The service was good, the food arrived quickly and the multiple servings of grits which my daughter mowed through were hot, scrumptious and seemingly bottomless.
Now, Saturday... we waited an exceedingly long time for a table, the hostess told us it would be around 30 minutes, and we were seated in the busiest thoroughfare more than 45 minutes later. The waitress brought our menus, which were considerably smaller than the weekday menu and distinctly lacking in vegetarian options, and then disappeared for an extended period. We asked if they could do the veg burger but they said no, and at this point I didn't want to wait at another restaurant so we decided to stay, I eventually decided on the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, which does not come with chips - this was not noted on the menu where it actually says that all sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, but when I asked after the chips I was told they would be an additional side and that the soup, which was part of the meal on the menu, was in fact a side I had ordered. This was a rather awkward exchange and I gave up on my lovely chips. The soup was thin, and the cheese was lurid orange, plasticky processed American cheese instead of the ""sharp cheddar"" on the menu. This made me sad. The bread is doorstop thick and soft, which is a perk. We felt very rushed, and they brought the check before we had finished eating, or, in fact ordering, as well as removing dishes before we had finished eating. Its a really fabulous place to eat, during the week, but give the weekends a miss.",0,0,0

The chicken fried steak is solid.  Portions are large and comes w\/ eggs, potatoes, and bread.  My only gripe was the chicken was kind of soggy due to the gravy.  I'd recommend getting the gravy on the side that way it doesn't compromise the breading on the steak.
