I'm vegetarian, so I'm limited to begin with; and I'm kind of a health nut, so that limits me further.  If you're at all like me, avoid the egg dishes with the hash browns; in my opinion, there wasn't enough taste to compensate for how much oil\/butter\/fat was clearly used.  On the other hand, the waffles with fruit are SO GOOD.  I haven't tried the pancakes, but plan to next time I'm there.  I haven't tried any of the dinner options (not many options there for vegetarians), but if you like having breakfast anytime, this place is open 24\/7 and serves breakfast items all day and all night.  It's a handy place to come if it's midnight and you're starving!

The cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.  The food by itself isn't mind-blowing, but it has a cool vibe - and conveniently is open 24\/7, for your round-the-clock eating needs.  I live here in Vegas, so I'm sure I'll be back many times in the future.",0,0,0

Most of it is a large, eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back. There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.

The dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.

I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.

Overall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds. It is quite popular, but also worth it.",8,4,6

However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit.  The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.

A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.

My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.

My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.

Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.

It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time.",0,0,0

You have plenty of choices when it comes to the fare. It's quite a cornucopia \/ mishmash of food. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty, but it wasn't something that wowed me. Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.

Basically, I should have tried something that was more on the ""diner"" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves ""BBQ"", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order ""BBQ"".

I am a sucker for breakfast foods, so I always seem to go for the fruity french toast. However the last time I shared a philly cheesesteak (which was great by the way!) and the nachos. OMG those nachos are insane! They arrived at our table on huge plate, piled high! We ordered it with the ground beef. The cheese& bean dip, salsa, and sour cream arrive on the side. That thing you can share with 5+ people! Between the two of us, we didn't even make a dent. Our server boxed it all up for us and it still took two to-go containers! There is also a photographer that comes by to all the tables and offers you a complimentary picture. We passed on the picture, but next time I might have to prom pose with my gigantic stack of pancakes! *swoon*

The d√©cor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.

The food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table.

Also, she offered to box up our food... but didn't give us one of our leftover meals.  Small mistake, but I had almost an entire sandwich and plate of fries that she didn't give is.  I didn't notice until we got home, so the food I intended to have later was wasted.",0,0,0

We enjoyed breakfast here on our way outta town this week after it came HIGHLY recommended by our hotel's front desk.

We got there before most of Vegas woke up (10am) and therefore missed a massive line but still had to wait about 15 minutes. 

We choose to hang in the lounge for a bit where we sat on plush, fuzzy couches and some of the best honey roasted peanuts I've ever had!?!

There was some crazy stringy cheese action going on. I sent it back and the manager Martha brought it out 10 minutes later to point out how there was no stringy cheese. And of course tell me I was wrong because that's the best way to keep customers in their place. Obviously the stringy cheese quality goes away when it's cold!! Way to go Martha! A plus service!,0,2,0

After rumors circulated in the car that Holly from Girls Next Door dines there often, I assumed it was in the Planet Hollywood or another reputable hotel. Not the case. It is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. They did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. My spirits began to rise again when I saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very Vegas. We got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. The menu is extremely long and not in a good way. Not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. Also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. I ordered a Salty Dog thinking it was a beer label I recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. My pesto burger was weird but pretty good. To top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay.

As we were driving up Las Vegas boulevard, I could see the sign for the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. It was a bright beacon on an otherwise gloomy day. The Peppermill used to be my grandma's favorite place to go back in the day, but I digress. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

We arrived about 3:30ish on Saturday afternoon. We had a 7 p.m. reservation at Rao's so we had time to kill. The room was pretty much empty with the exception of the section of seats that surrounded the fire pit. We found a nice big lounge area and the 3 of us parked ourselves for some drinks. The decor is a trip. Lots of neon and mirrors, but to me, it is old Vegas and with the untimely departure of the Rivera that used to stand next door, old Vegas is hard to hold on to.

Crystal was our server and was prompt at arriving at our table when we sat down. I ordered my usual Maker's Mark Manhattan, and the other two gents with me ordered a Martini and a beer. We enjoyed ourselves for s few hours as Crystal was always stopping by to check on us and make sure our drinks were good. After all was said and done for 3 Martinis, 3 Manhattans, and 2 beers, our total came out to a little over $60 which wasn't bad. 

By the time we left at about 5:30, the room started to get busy. The good news is that a younger crowd was coming in and there was enough staff to handle the people coming in. This is the kind of thing that will hopefully keep the Fireside Lounge around for a long time.",0,1,0

The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly.

It really does look like it a throwback version of what Vegas was in the 70's. The employees wear weird costumes that I don't quite understand. The waitresses dress in blue and white overall\/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. But the service itself was sort of slow. It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. 

The do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....

But as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. 

This place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less.

First off, the atmosphere\/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub\/strip club.. Disco ball glass, Cherry Blossom Trees and Neon Lights.. Interesting and totally Vegas!

What will make me come back again and again:

Southern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string\/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! 

French Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1\/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right! 

Marinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern\/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).

Dined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it..

Let's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of ""old Vegas"". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.

The Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled ""Fireside Lounge"". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.

To your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit \/ flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit \/ flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.

On corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.

The best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.

Combine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.

And I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.

So on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. 

The portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1\/2 a star for the ambiance.

The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed.",6,0,5

My wife and I went here for breakfast at about 10am because of the outstanding reviews.  It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).

First, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.

But that was where the good points ended.

 I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached\/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of ""meat"" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.

I'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1\/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).

I can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:

a. rating service only.
b. into ""all you can eat"" style dining.
c. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.

Sorry, but it was big waste of time and money.  You're much better off finding a greasy-spoon off the strip and eating something tastier, cheaper, and MUCH quicker.",0,0,0

She was rude and not customer service oriented when I had brought visiting family members in for dinner this evening. After spending a hefty bill bringing in a party of 8. To start one meal was about 20 min late to the table after everyone else had received their entree. Which was fine when the waitress returned several times and insisted the meal would be right out. At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did.

Well, Peppermill would be the love child.

This casual dining restaurant on the north end of the Strip between the Riviera and Encore\/Wynn is... kinda strange when it comes to decor.

The place is super dark, with black floor to ceiling and then neon blue and pink lights accenting just about everything. I was uncertain about actually eating here because the decor just does not evoke the kind of restaurant it actually is.

As for the food, it's definitely above average, family restaurant fare. Lots of breakfast items available all day long, plus a long list of sandwiches and the like. I treated myself to a plate of nachos as an entree since I had been craving them all week. They were among the better I've had, with real melted cheese on top, although they did go a bit overboard with the beef. The people from my conference I was with seemed to enjoy their cheesesteak and burger as well. It probably won't be the best you've ever eaten, especially if you're from a bigger city, but it's pretty darn good.

The service wasn't so spectacular. Our waitress wasn't very attentive and had this attitude about her that wasn't so much pleasantly refreshing as it was, ""I have better places to be than here, but that isn't your fault so I'm not going to be outright mean.""

And the prices, definitely higher than comparable places not in Las Vegas, but still far cheaper than most of what you'll find on the Strip. And the portions are pretty huge. I couldn't finish my nachos, and I had barely eaten anything else that day up until that point.

So yeah, it's far from perfect, but it's a nice place to eat when you want a good sit down meal, but are sick and tired of being fancy on the Strip.",3,4,2

After reading the reviews and looking at all the pictures I guess I kinda expected to eat around some sort of fire, but I was wrong. The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected. 

I ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name). 

The coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold. 

The mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  

The Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. 

The portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. 

The service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed. 

We probably won't come back here again. At least not until I'm 21 and can check out the lounge :P",3,2,2

This place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.  

There's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.

This place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.

There's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w\/the Maserati omelet filled w\/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall\/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w\/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!! 

You can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w\/my meal.

Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits.

Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same. 

The menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much. Now, they are just about right.

The place can get crowded at times and depending on who is taking care of you, the service can be touch and go. But, this restaurant remains a must go to on the Vegas strip. It is like stepping back by a decade or two.",0,0,0

Peppermill, I have heard of you and I have been told that you serve the best breakfast food. And now, finally, I was able to experience you first hand. And here I my verdict, Peppermill- I am in love with you. I'm in live with your Eggs Benedict and your rainbow sugar! Why oh why do you do this to me? Why do you have to be hundreds of miles away from me? Why, oh why is it only when I crave you, that I have to drive 4 hours away to see you- to taste you? 

Oh how my heart breaks, how my heart aches for you.

Standard American diner fare--if you're anything like me, that's a pretty common craving to have. Each pancake probably weighs a solid pound, their omelets are made with TEN eggs, and their hash browns are beautifully crispy and will not leave you wanting anything more. I wouldn't recommend the waffles unless you've really got a craving (you do you), only because they're pretty ordinary in size and taste and don't even come with sides. Their lemon-cranberry muffin is sweet enough to be a dessert on its own!

Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny's. Then I would be coming there all the time. 

Located next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter ""C"", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. 

The staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. 

Looking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don't mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn't. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. 

If your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant.",2,0,1

The wife and I came in for breakfast on a Tuesday morning. The place was full, but they were able to find us a seat. We were greeted quickly by the hostess and asked if we wanted a drink from the bar. I did, so she sent over a cocktail waitress in a cocktail dress. 

We settled in and took in the decor. Because they were busy and I had a screwdriver in front of me, we didn't make any note of the time. My wife commented that the place looks like the back of Sammy Johns' 1973 Chevy van. Wonderfully kitschy.

Our waitress took our order and made great suggestions, because I had trouble deciding what I wanted. They were excellent suggestions. My wife had a pesto chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread. I ordered Munch's breakfast.

Both dishes were huge and easily could have been split between us. I dove into my plate, hash browns mixed with onions, mushrooms, peppers and linguica, topped with eggs. I enjoyed it so much that I never even asked for a bite of the sandwich. I know she enjoyed it because she kept nibbling on it even after the point of immobility. I fully understood, as I was at the same point picking out slices of linguica from my plate.

Service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner. 

I would recommend hands down the BBQ pork ribs dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. Get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! Other notable favorites include the Chicken Fried Steak, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Lasagna.

this last time would be the exception. Ms. Elisha was my bone of contention even prior to seating. Her initial look made it seem as if we knew each other and not in a good way.. so the idea that we were seated her area for service seem unreal.. she made us wait without acknowledging our presence at all.. then when she came to take our order she looked over and around us out the window.. still I smile.. when she was done my husband asked me if there was something interesting out the window.. 
when the food was ready it was damn near tossed in the table.. we did not see her again until the receipt was ready.. she literally in passing tossed the receipt on the table almost in my husbands plate.. I stopped smiling at that point.. she saw the expression on my face change.. because I was fed up.. so she did decided to turn around and come back to the table and give some    Insincere ass attempt at service recovery.. but it was too late.. you don't throw things.. and you don't behave as if someone is bothering your ass while you're at work.. I'm only hoping that I'm not subjected to this missy on my next visit.. but they can keep serving bomb food..",1,0,0

There was a wait list and it was cool that we got to hang out in the fireside lounge and get some drinks while waiting in a dark, mysterious lounge by a fire that was surrounded by water. In a way this diner was a bite too dark and it pretty old school retro. I mean it is a diner and at least they did something interesting about this place lol. After our wait was over we got seated, there were fake trees surrounding the booths and was not as dark as the lounge area. 

Me and my bf split the Joe's San Francisco Special after asking the waitress if the food portion is share able and she said yes so we just shared it. OMG the food portion size is huge! Good thing we shared because it was also so filling that we could not even finish it.... The food itself was interesting it seems to be it could of been scrambled eggs with spinach , plus some pork sausage on the side, with hash browns, and all covered on top like a nacho cheese sauce but instead its all layered in the dish as one whole meal!

Open 24 hours? Check.
""Interesting"" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.

Indoor firepit? Check.

As Damon H mentions, the food is ""surprisingly very good.""  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.

The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)",3,2,2

Went here last week for a friend's birthday. It's has that nostalgic old Vegas feel. The ambiance is very noisy, colorful, neon & Art Deco. 

Service was poor. We had to ask for a cocktail waitress 4 times about 25 minutes after seating before we got to order drinks. They have a system where a waitress from the lounge area serves alcoholic beverages. The regular restaurant server does not. Prices were very reasonable. We ordered a bottle of wine from the small list that they had. Also tried a specialty cocktail. It was too sweet and tasted very artificial. 

The food portion was pretty big. Porterhouse didn't look very appetizing. The ribeye was good. Crab cakes were decent. Overall food was mediocre at best. 

After dinner we went over to the lounge side where the fire pit is. Fire pit was crowded so we sat at a large booth nearby and order drinks. We ordered Old Fashions, Moscow Mule & Mandrin Vodka\/Soda. The drinks were weak and watered down. 

Overall we enjoyed ourselves cause we had great company with us. I probably won't be back here anytime soon. Possibly in 20+ years.",1,1,0

From the outside, it looks as if this place has closed down.  Then you walk in and it is dimly lit, purple carpeting and neon lights scattered throughout.  

The A\/C is blowing as cold as possible, their are tourists and alcoholics everywhere, the waitresses are VERY scantily clad and you at first feel like you walked into a strip club by accident. 

The hot wings are decent at best, Munch's breakfast which is similar to a breakfast hash was not bad but not that good and I also ordered Joe's San Francisco special, which was definitely the best dish I had their.  Even this dish was maybe a 2 star at best, the only positive of this place is having fun watching the waitresses picking things up off the floor.

I had heard about the Peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that I make a stop there during my stay in Sin City. When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.
The lettering on the outside said a lot when I see ""PEPPERMILL"" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, ""Do you get a headache working here?"" She giggled and said,"" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it."" 
As she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.
I called my brother in law for ""must-haves"" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.
Rumors of the breathtaking ""Fireside Lounge"" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there.

At any rate, I was primed and ready for a hearty, big-portioned meal. The Peppermill apparently has notoriety for that. I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint.

We were enticed by the Chicken Nachos as an appetizer. Little did we know that the Chicken Nachos would actually end up as our appetizer AND dinner. The serving size was enormous. Huge! Slathered in a variety of melted cheeses and topped with all the usual suspects, it was amazing. What I loved about it was that all the accouterments were served on the side: a bowl of re-fried beans and more melted cheese, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. It's nice to be able to have control over the toppings.  Heaven! Bliss! After we were done with the nachos we knew we couldn't even consider ordering a dinner entree. 

I'm a little disappointed because I really was excited about trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. It'll have to wait until another trip, sadly. 

We also ordered margaritas. Honestly, they seemed watered down. But we are from San Diego and have very high standards for our margaritas. As such, I'll give them a pass for that. 

The Peppermill appears to have an eclectic demographic, consisting primarily of locals (at least at dinner hour). Our cab driver confirmed that. The douchebags don't typically venture that far down the strip, from what I've learned. 

I would highly recommend this place. If you're a foodie like me, you will leave in a happy food coma. Make reservations in advance to avoid a wait. I'm glad I did.",4,4,4

We are from Maryland and decided to visit this restaurant after seeing great online reviews. This is probably the only vacation we will have for the upcoming year so we wanted to indulge. We had no idea we would be so disappointed.

Upon entering the restaurant it was quite busy, that was completely understandable due to the population. The hostess was taking names and party sizes to be placed on a waiting list. I asked another patron about the wait who advised it was at least 15 minutes. Once at the front of the line a friend and I waited patiently for the hostess to acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes, were still not acknowledged. However, a female patron approached the hostess while we were standing there waiting and she was acknowledged. I guess I was born the wrong sex. The hostess proceeded to ask the woman her name and party size. Before the woman could respond my friend spoke up and stated that we had been waiting to be put on the list for some time now, he stated his name and our party size.

The hostess then stared at us in a rude manner, as if we did something wrong. We patiently waited for her to acknowledge us but we had to be the ones to initiate the communication to be added to the list and seated.

After waiting 30 minutes, our party of five was seated in the dining area. The server greeted us and delivered 3 waters to our table. Keep in mind, It was 98 degrees outside, a little warm in the room and we had a party of 5. We advised our server multiple times that we needed two more waters to accommodate our party of five. The server then immediately blamed the busboy. We were not trying to be confrontational, we just wanted 5 waters as we had a party of 5. Eventually after asking multiple servers and busboys we got the two remaining waters which took way too long.

Upon resolving the initial hostess and water issue, we were approached by a bar attendant. The attendant asked us if we would like to order any alcoholic beverages, we replied Yes. 

I ordered a Pina Colada. When my drink arrived, I took one sip and instantly experienced a taste that reminded me of sour milk. After taking a sip of the unsettling beverage I called over the waitress.

I explained my concerns with the drink, she then advised me that the drink could not be exchanged but they could attempt to fix the sour taste. She stated that there was nothing she could do and sent over a manager.

The manager, I believe her name was Peggy advised me that they could only attempt to fix the drink and could not make me anything different in exchange. She then chuckled as she said ""You knew what it would taste like"". I replied, I have never had a Pine Colada taste like sour milk. She then said she would be removing the drink from my bill, but wasn't very nice. I guess I was supposed to just deal with the taste of sour milk in the prepared Pina Colada.

After getting that issue resolved our server delivered our food, but failed to accommodate our condiment request. We made six different request for syrup and by the time it was delivered our French toast and waffles were cold. In addition, three of our meals came with muffins which we did not get until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and will never forget the treatment we received.

Overall, the food was ok, but it came out late and incomplete. I felt totally insulted by the manager who chuckled as she said ""You knew what it would taste like"" in regards to the Pina Colada. I've had many Pina Coladas and they've never tasted like sour milk or resulted in a stomach ache. I almost feel like there was malice behind it tasting the way it did, and that's unacceptable! 

I felt discriminated against when trying to be seated, as me and my party was overlooked by the host, but other parties were helped. 3 parties that arrived after us were seated before us to be exact. Not to forget about the attitude we received when we initiated the communication to be seated. As a restaurant goer, I am totally disappointed in The Peppermill Lounge and will make it my business never to return to this establishment. I will also spread the word to family and friends.

In addition my friends who also bought alcoholic beverages stated the drinks had a weird taste. They also wanted to return there drinks but due to the managers comment they just paid for them without drinking them.",11,3,0

Inexpensive and inoffensive. That's how I viewed the restaurant and food. It was early bird specials all over the place. The food might have glimpsed a spice rack in the distance while it was traveling to our table, but it didn't stop to say hello or mingle with anything flavorful. But really, when you're drunk and hungry, tastes get in the way of the  barnyard biological imperative to stuff yourself and soak up the booze.

The waitresses were incredibly friendly, but seemed over-worked as they would accidentally abandon tables to time and history periodically. We recruited the woman hawking souvenir photos to find us someone capable of refilling our coffee and averted disaster that way.

We had a large group, about 10, and it took a really long time to seat us, even though we seemed to be the only people waiting in the front. They finally sat us down with attitude after about 20 minutes when we complained. Then we were served by the most sassy waitress I've ever had, whose idea of asking for orders was, ""What you want?!"" After waiting for our food for a good bit we were all served our breakfast...cold. The Munch's Breakfast I ordered was literally thrown down on the table in front of me and was abysmal. The eggs tasted powdered or like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced.

Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.  

Upon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.

If you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.  

The breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.  

These are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.

She is very knowledgeable of the food they serve & was spot on with her suggestions. Although she was busy, she was very warm, friendly and attentive.

FOOD:  Eggs Benedict (as CJ said) was yummy!  

I ordered the Western fruit plate \/ platter that usually comes with banana bread & marshmallow cream sauce which 1) I did not want and 2) they did not have, so CJ asked if I wanted a muffin or something in lieu. Of my choices, I  chose the lemon muffin which CJ said was really good and it REALLY was! Loved it!  The only thing....CJ could have warned me of the large amount of fruit that I had unknowingly ordered. Yikes! But so yummy!

ESTABLISHMENT:  Came across Peppermill via Yelp, and its old school Vegas charm & good reviews made us pick it as our late breakfast \/ lunch destination.

Haven't been to Vegas for nearly 9 years now, I  initially thought the low ceilings, neon lights & crowd made this to be a wrong choice on our part.

Even at 2 in the afternoon, it was crowded with a steady stream of people.  We were greeted right away, the gal took our name, told us it was about a 20 minute wait and said we could wait in the bar if we'd like. 

The bar is to the left, separated from the dining area itself.  Thank goodness cuz it was a bit too smokey for our taste.  Cool bar area though!  Just a little to early in the day for us for that atmosphere.  (Yes, we're a little older in age.  Oh and I'm a former smoker.)

We waited in the entry area instead which is kinda small, with slot machines on one wall & a big support beam towards another wall.

We waited about 10-15 minutes before being called for our table. Because the hostess called two parties & we both approached the hostess desk, there was a little confusion about who she was taking to be seated.

There was a gal walking around offering to take a ""complimentary"" picture of us, but we declined.  She was nice, not pushy, but....no thanks.

There was a gal dressed in a long black dress (wait staff, hostess, cashier had uniforms), asking us for any drink orders.  Nice & attentive, remembered to check on us.

SUMMARY:  Cool place to check out. Our waitress made our experience exponentially better.  Other staff was nice.  Food was yummy.  

Would we go back again? Probably not.  But this review comes from a near 50, partied hard in my younger days but now I'm more into the wine & chill scene, kind of person.  

Would we suggest people go check it out at least once? Definitely....and ask to sit in CJ's section.  ;-)",0,0,0

I always get breakfast so that is the only thing on which I can advise you.

Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious.  This last time I got the crab eggs benedict meal.  Crab, poached egg, hollandaise, english muffin.  

I took a group of fellow realtors here after our last day of a convention and everyone loved their food.  

They are good portions as well. 

The service is stellar every time I am there.  They have cocktail waitresses and separate food waitresses.  

If there is a wait to be seated you can sit in the fireside lounge and have a beverage.  They'll bring your drink to your table if your table becomes ready before you get your drink.

Food doesn't take forever to come out of which I am a fan.  

Even other people who patron the place are nice and want to converse with you.  I guess good food, good service, and quick service will do that to you.

The big round booths are comfortable.  You won't be too disappointed by the MASSIVE portions.  I mean, pancakes larger than a frisbee (but luckily very soft and fluffy).  But beware, these portions can't really be finished unless you're a serious eating machine (or you're sharing one meal with, like, four people), and you will pay for them.  VERY expensive for what's essentially ""diner"" food.  For the experience, I think it's worth it once. 

I like that the cocktail waitresses come by almost right after you sit down to see if you want spirits from the Fireside lounge.  The service is hit or miss.  For instance, if you say you need a ""minute"" to review the menu, be prepared to wait a lifetime for the server to come back.

Service overall left a little to be desired. But I mean, what can you really expect? We only were on the restaurant side, although we heard good things about the lounge side of the place. Definitely a diner type feel to this place and whatever you get, underestimate what you can eat because everything is MASSIVE. Two people could easily split most of their plates.

The other time I got the Pancake Combo which included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The pancakes were like 8 inches in diameter!

When you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It's next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.

We entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club\/vegas dive bar\/I really don't even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It's definitely one of those ""you must experience it for yourself"" kind of places.

I ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper's recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.

The S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I'm not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.

The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there!
On another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95
***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night.

First, let me say that I don't like diner food, I detest ""breakfast"" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: OMG vom) and ""traditional"" ""American"" food barely qualifies as food IMO. (Pizza, burgers and chow mein: now THAT's American! Meatloaf and steak & eggs: ICK!) So to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. It IS, however, open 24\/7 and near-ish my hotel.

First trip: I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's OK because it was gross. The sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. The garlic bread with ""cheese"" on it was revolting.
My mum ordered the Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta. Hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. The sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, I swear, Mezetta brand right out of the jar (but I like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Cheese & Herb flavour.
Second trip: I ordered New York steak and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. The shrimp were, too. My mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so I didn't taste them, but she said they were OK.
I think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but I will avoid it. The waitresses were cute and helpful, though. And the decor is amusing.",0,1,0

After visiting on our last trip and immensely enjoying the food and experience,  the wife and I chose to revisit for our wedding celebration to share the french toast ambrosia and a few drinks before heading back to the hotel. Awful. The french toast was undercooked and unappealing while the fruit itself was not ripe or much beyond edible. The fruit salad and french toast on our flight home on Delta was ten times better and very delicious. It's sad when airline food is better than the Peppermill. I had a Mai Tai and the wife had an espresso martini (which was horrible).  As for service, eh, it was okay, she brought us drinks and our food. We didn't tip and that is rare. We finished our one drink each and made a hasty retreat. Overall, save yourself and don't go. We won't be returning.",0,0,0

When you're looking to bring an out-of-towner to a classic, old Vegas joint for a bite - you do the Peppermill. The portions are HUGE, the food is diner-y, and the staff's costumes are absurd. 

On this occasion we over heard the hostess call another diner a 'dumb b*tch' to another staff member, and I was pretty disgusted. Not only should you never speak about a customer this way, there's no excuse for it to be done on the floor in front of other diners. Gross. I left a comment on the comment card at the table. 

The french dip sandwich is so good that my husband gets it every time we go. I've tried some of the appetizers and the BLT - they are typical diner fare, so I'm still searching for my go-to meal at the Peppermill. The menu is arduous and nothing really pops out at you, because it's stuff you've seen before. I'm sure something will eventually tickle my tastebuds. 

Along with the neon lights and indoor trees\/garden - you'll find a container of sugar sprinkles on each table which is a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure why each table would need this at all times, but it helps to make Peppermill the Peppermill - and that's okay with me.

I mean, I LOVE Vegas. I LOVE diner food, and um yeah, I LOVE Anthony Bourdain. Three great things must equal excellence, right?

Wrong. I was so unimpressed. 

BFF and I drove into Vegas at 5am on a Thursday. So yes, we were stone cold sober, which I think was the problem. I can completely understand how, if you might have had one or nine cocktails, you would think the Peppermill was the shit. With bright neon lights, ginormous portions, and pretty quick service, it is a drinkers dream. I was charmed by the fake cherry trees and our friendly waitress.

Our food, however, was gross. I had the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce, simply put. It was gray and was more like gravy. My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce. 

For our two meals and two sodas, it was $36. Way too much for such a lackluster meal. I gotta admit, it hurt my heart a lil to know that my Anthony and so many Yelpers could be occasionally wrong.",0,0,0

My husband and I have always made a special trip to the Peppermill every time we're in Vegas, so naturally, we picked it as the location for our rehearsal dinner. I called to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance. I even wrote to them on their site to ask about the availability of a vegan meal for one of my guests. I never got an email or call back, by the way. 

When I called to make the reservation for 6 people, I confirmed with the manager about a vegan meal. I called back a week later to add 2 more people to my reservation, and change my time to 6PM. So it was confirmed, TWICE. When we got to the Peppermill, they had no reservations for us. The hostess said we would have to wait with everyone else and made no apologies for the mistake. She even said they do not accept reservations, even though it says they do on their site and I called and did so! I asked to speak with a manager. The manager had no explanation and was actually rude about it. Our party had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, which defeated the purpose of me making reservations in the first place. Then, once we ordered, my meal and my husband's meal was served 20 minutes after everyone else in my party's meal. 

This was the worst experience I have ever had at the Peppermill. My reception dinner was ruined. I was so embarrassed by the poor service and the rudeness of the hostess and manager, especially after we told everyone what a great place this was. I can't see myself dining there again.

Don't let the decor scare you, at first it's a little overwhelming, but you will grow to love the cheesiness of it. The corned beef hash is pretty good here. It's not crispy like I would prefer, but it's the perfect combination of just corned beef and potatoes. I can't tell if service (food wise) is slow here or if it's just because I'm always starving when I come here. Either way, the servers are really accommodating.

My cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but I'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so I left them in the room & went exploring. We were staying at Circus Circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out I decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. Now, I'm not into gambling but I figured I'm in Vegas so I might as well do a little bit of gambling. Within 5 minutes of sitting down I won over $20 on a slot machine so I decided I would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. I didn't see anything at Circus Circus that fit the bill so I went out walking and within a few blocks saw The Peppermill. I figured that was the place.

It was pretty much packed so I sat at the counter. After looking the menu over I quickly decided on the New York Strip & eggs. The place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. I ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an English muffin. The waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.

Everything came out as ordered. The 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but I found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. I found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. The steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. Eggs were spot on sunny side up. Hash browns crispy. Everything was exactly what I was wanting in a late night dinner. Adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, I paid & left satisfied.",3,3,3

That being said, The Peppermill is a must-see\/do for anyone, Vegas native or not. I genuinely believe that this place has got to at least be a contender for top five diners in the U.S.!

The first time I ever came here, as soon as I walked through the door, I gasped in delight. I couldn't help myself. This is the prettiest diner you have ever seen!!! It's so beautius. The faux foliage with lights, the neon, the dim lighting... It all works so well together, and creates an overall classic retro, yet modernized feel. They have these cool flat screen TVs on the wall at one booth that flash to different scenes around the world. Really nifty to watch while you wait for your food. This place is maybe where say, a pimp might bring his bottom bit*h out for a semi-classy meal at 3am. I mean that in a good way, seriously.

If you have read the other reviews, then you already know: This is the place to come for some after-bar people watching. They get all kinds up in these parts. But everyone is so soothed by the wonderful interior ambiance and happily munching away at num nums that the times I have been there, I have not seen the typical drunk and angry bickering here.

The food is more expensive than your usual diner fare, but it's worth it. Not only is it all pretty much delicious, but you get large portion sizes too. I also love that you are serviced by the waitresses from the Fireside Lounge at your table, so if you wanna keep boozin' it up, that option is open to you. 
Speaking of waitresses, all the ladies who work in the diner are wearing the cutest outfits!! I almost considered temporarily getting a job there, jut to get the outfit!

The place is just a snazzy, super Vegas diner, with quick service. There was a bit of a wait, but you can go into the lounge for a cocktail while you'r waiting for a table. I had a mimosa, and my friend had a very awesome Bloody Mary. Nice 'n spicy.

I had the corned beef hash. It was good. The portion was ginormous. I had it for an early morning snack the next morning (thank goodness for the kitchenettes in the Trump!)

She wanted something much more casual and breakfast lol. What better place than the Peppermill. I was a bit caught off guard because I haven't been to this place in YEARS! I forgot how good it was. When we arrived it wasn't even busy and we were able to be seated immediately! The hostess was very friendly and helped us find a big enough table for 6 including a chair to sit my baby niece in. I also forgot how cool the ambiance of the place was with the neon lights and old school diner style tables. The outfits of the employee's are so cute it's so funny to see them walking around especially the cocktail or beverage girls. Not quite sure what they are called officially but either way it's cute! 

Like many have already raved about.. HUGE PORTIONS! I checked the pictures on Yelp prior to arrival and I had my taste buds fixed on one of these crazy big omelette's. It was more so in the evening dinner kind of time and I thought it was funny that my family all was in the mood for breakfast food. Except my nephew (teenager) just had to be different and get a sandwhich lol. Anyways let's get to this food! Yum!

I ordered the Key Lime pie martini, complete with a graham cracker rim. It was creamy, sweet and strong. Loved it! My husband had a huge Mai Tai and I actually laughed at him when it came out because it was a giant girly drink. It was also very strong and good.

But the venue is extremely cool, and rates an extra star.

If you happen to be Andre the Giant or a member of the I.F.O.C.E, you'll be able to eat everything on your plate.  Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.

I sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting.
The waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.

The Peppermill is just a diner with a lot of flair.  I'll return on my next visit to LV.  You should too!

We came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time]. 

We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip. 

Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace. 

There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch! 

It is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus.

inside is just as worse as it looks on the outside. its like a 1970's ate up the amazon forest and threw it up in here. decor is just horrible. we took a peak inside the Fireside Lounge and at least that part looked a lot better but unfortunately, they don't serve the full menu which was what most of the people in our party wanted. 

anyway, we were seated in a long booth for our party of 9, all facing the same direction which was really awkward so we asked to have a few extra chairs so that we could sit across from each other instead of sitting on a bench and having to yell like we were benchwarmers. luckily the servers were nice enough to let us do that even though we would be blocking the walk way. the menu was pretty extensive, but honestly, it's just like a typical diner. some of us ordered breakfast, some just a salad, some ordered sandwiches. none were spectacular. i shared the gyro sandwiches which came with a side of sweet potato fries for $12. it was OK.

The portions are HUGE.  The servers are awesome and very friendly.  The short skirts and evening gowns sure don't hurt either. :)  The menu is huge and varied.    

I have eaten here a few times and have ordered breakfast,  a burger, a sandwich, and entrees.  All of the food has been properly prepared.  All of the food has been a seven or better.   

You really can't go wrong eating here because the food is good, the service is good, the place is fun\/funky.  It is a little pricey but being on the strip, and a touristy place it is to be expected.   Go!",2,1,1

I absolutely love this place and no visit to Vegas is complete without it. Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from ""Alice"" into ""Fantasy Island"" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, ""Would you like olives with that?"" He was a bit taken aback, but said, ""No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?"" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, ""I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini."" Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more. It's kind of like your slightly mentally-challenged child--you can't help but have affection despite its issues.

Sour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive.",0,0,0

Kicking back in the lounge, the fellow patrons are a real example of one side of Vegas. I can't hold too much against the place, but watching what had to be the most awkward romantic failures was somewhere between unbearable and utterly amusing.

The cocktails are another story. The Singapore Sling was fairly average. Some people might appreciate that, but I consider it a sin. Their gimlet tasted like drinking pure sweetened lime juice.

The Peppermill Lounge is a LV institution, and has been for over 30 years.

""I'm 21.. in town for the weekend from Cali , and I'm going to Pure!.""  You get the drift.

The staff: Our waitress was friendly.  It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long ""gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress"".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?

The goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.  

The atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of ""greenery"", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.

We went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it's Vegas.",3,1,2

I had their garden salad, mushroom cream soup, and some garlic bread. Sadly the only thing I liked much out of all three was the bread, but I didn't even finish it. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger & we had ""heard"" that the burgers here were humongous. His wasn't even big at all, and he claims it was ""alright"". However my nephew ordered a mushroom burger & his was big! I saw a few other tables who ordered the nachos (from the appetizer menu)..boy that thing is HUGE!!! I would've been down for that instead :P My other cousin ordered the quesadilla which looked delicious but she didn't seem to finish it. Most of my other family members ordered breakfast & they seemed satisfied; they came in huge portions.

Upon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very Vegas indeed. The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.

Since I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. 

My cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. 

My boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. 

Finally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. 

Overall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person.

So, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. 

The hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. 

We walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. 

The food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot.

That's always a good sign - a place has to be good if there are so many people willing to wait for the first meal of the day! Fortunately, there were a couple of seats available at the counter, and we asked the hostess if there was a queue for that. Nope!! So we just walked straight in and it was the most awesome feeling in the world - jumping a queue of about 30. Haha

Anyways, on to the food. GIANT portion sizes. I am a ravenous beast in the morning, and I could only make through half of my Marco Pollo Omelet and the monster portion of hash browns. My husband ordered the french toast, and got 3 (or was it 4?) huge slices with a mound of fruit on top. The food was not uniquely delicious, but it was satisfying.

I got a ""garbage-can special"" type of dish that had eggs, sausage, ground beef, spinach, onions, hash-browns and a cheese sauce.  It came out in a bowl and while not looking very large, teased me into only finishing half of it.    My wife had French Toast Ambrosia (with fruit and stuff) which she loved.

I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  

My mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!

The decor is very unique.  There's a lot of neon lights, mirrored ceilings, and fake trees.  I didn't see the fireside lounge because the wait was a mere 5 minutes to be seated.  The place was fairly busy, so service was not very fast, but you can't blame the servers for that.

I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested Munch's Breakfast.  Sausage with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, topped with eggs and cheese?  Sounds great!  I was excited.  The meal came out and it felt like it was missing something.  It felt like I was eating a vegetable omelette - I realized that there was NO sausage.  I called the server over - not the easiest task when she's running around tending to many tables - and she said asked if I wanted to have them remake it.  I told her no since the person I came with was almost done with her meal.  She later brought out a plate of sausages.  Apparently the prep cook forgot to bring out the sausages and the cook just threw everything together not realizing that the sausage wasn't there.

I realize that mistakes happen and it wasn't the server's fault so I didn't tip her less than I would have for the service.  But I wish she addressed this with management so that they could have made some sort of adjustment for leaving out the sausage.  Seriously, that's like giving someone a car without brakes.  A chair with no legs.  A hooker with no condom.  All of the above may work but leads to an incomplete and potentially regretable experience.

Great to be able to get breakfast all day!  Nothing like getti g up at 5 PM after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.

Large.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  Nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  Hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the fish and chips (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).

I'd never heard of this place before, and never really seen it before even though it's so close to the Strip. My bf said he's been coming to this place for years so I guess for those that know about it, it's a legend. 

Why would anyone bother going to Denny's when you can go to the Peppermill?! 
Food was super fresh, I had a veggie omelette that was gigantic and perfectly fluffy. It seriously had to have been made with at least four or five eggs. Sadly I couldn't finish it, especially since it also came with toast and I got fruit instead of potatoes. Mind you, this was good fruit, not just some grapes and a slice of melon. It was more like a mini fruit salad along with all the other food! 

I must say, I have a special place in my heart for the kind of gaudy decor (fake plants and pink flamingo lamps) that awaits you at The Peppermill. The waitresses all wear cute little outfits and are super friendly, seemed like they've probably worked here since it opened.
Apparently there's also a nice fire pit in the other room, which I didn't get a chance to see. It's open 24-hours too so, of course, I am a fan. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town and I'd love to see what they have for dinner...",3,1,2

And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.

Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.

Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free.

No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew.

The food there was bland and uneventful. I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. 
My husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. 
The best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks.

The ladies dress in cute dresses walking around in the bar\/lounge area. And their most famous thing in the bar\/lounge area is of course the fire pit. Oh, and I suggest everybody to try the Scorpion. It's good.

The restaurant serves huge portions of food. A group of 3 or 4 people could order just their nachos and share the whole thing. All of their food is good.

I had the CLUB SANDWICHES for the first time. There was a lot of bacon and ham. The bread was toasted. It was great. And, it came with a lot of fries! 

The second time, my husband and I shared 22OZ STRAWBERRY MILK SHAKE. It was HUGE and GREAT!!! My husband and I loved it! 

Also, I ordered CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. That was my first chicken fried steak. It was covered with gravy. It was crunchy and flavorful. The steak was so big that I didn't even touch the eggs. Haha...

Sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but once you get over all the things people HATE Vegas for, you realize how amazing this Postmodern Paradise is in all its glory. 

That said, I'm so happy that a place like Peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here. 

This place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there's a Canter's in Vegas, but if Canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. The ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! Just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding. 

The menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24\/7 diner-like place should have. Prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day. By the time we got there, we were all FAMISHED. 

The varied menu made it hard to choose, but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I've Made in My Short Life. It may have been the fact that I was super hungry, but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy. I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. If I was challenged to marry the thing, I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the ""honeymoon"" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. It was that good. 

Oh, I sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good. 

But back to my sandwich. I don't know...we may have been caught up in the moment, maybe it was just good timing. I don't know if I were to return, things would be the same, but maybe...just maybe, I'll give it a try.",7,6,7

This place intrigued me from the start, but I almost didn't walk inside. I thought it would be in a casino, but from the outside it looks like an old Denny's complete with cheesy writing on the windows. But just ignore all the families waiting for a table as you bypass the restaurant and venture to the lounge for tropical drinks and shenanigans.

This is what a 70s pick up bar looks like in my dreams. Jack, Larry, Chrissy and Janet would love it! A dark jungle filled with couches and vines and touches of neon on the ceiling. Servers are lovely ladies in long black dresses slit to the hilt who join you on your lounge when taking your order. If you don't mind being part of the PDA show, sit on a loveseat in the firepit and become mesmerized by the bubbling electric blue liquid. Couples that want a little more privacy, should sit at one of the tables.

The majority of their cocktails are fruity tropical drinks and they pour heavy.  My early drinking days were filled with pina coladas and mai tais, but I've since transitioned to elegant cocktails. So it was like handing the reigns back to my early-20s self. I didn't have a care in the world here. They have a few beers, but nothing on tap. Prices are a bargain compared to other lounges on the Strip.

I've got to admit that there are a few buzzkills to an otherwise ridiculously awesome Vegas experience. There are TVs everywhere and they play a continuous loop of bizarre music videos and performance pieces. For every bit of Vegas spectacle (Cher) there was something absolutely ridiculous (early Mandy Moore or really late Hall & Oats). About half of the acts couldn't even be identified. It was sort of like watching and listening to a slo-mo hair band audio car crash. The more significant issue was the continual interruption of the speaker announcing that tables were ready in the restaurant. 

But if you can tune out those distractions, it is a swingingly good time. Mission accomplished!",7,8,7

The decor makes me think of a 1970's airport lounge.Its very retro, fun, and casual.

There is always a wait, if you don't appreciate that, get over yourself and go somewhere else. 

It always seems to be a madhouse and the wait staff is always busy. Be patient. 

I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)

The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1\/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)

I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like ""one dimensional"" Whats that about? Someone else said ""over priced"" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.

The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.

The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not.",1,0,0

All of the reviews stating that the decor is crazy, are so true! Mirrored ceiling tiles, pink and blue lighting, fake flowers, and flamingo lamps! Wow. Hello vegas. I've missed you.

The breakfast menu was extensive and the feta cheese and vegetable omlette caught my eye. Artchokes at a restaurant that looks like a strip club? Yes please!! I saw they had a meal with turkey sausage but it wasn't listed on the 'Sides' menu. Plus a side of meat was $5 and so that wouldn't have won anyways. The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top. We both managed to take half of our meals to go and they fully fed us the next morning too. For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.

I would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us.

My girlfriend and I had dinner at the Fire Side Lounge.

(Very nice!) and had our drink and food order taken quickly.  The food was OK but on the greasy side.  When it came to getting another round, the waitress was nowhere to be seen.  We flagged another one who indicated she would be right with us (she never came back), but it was near 15 minutes until someone was able to take our order.

My three eggs, cooked as ordered on a mound of delicious crisp homemade corned beef hash and a huge fresh bagel with cream cheese and strawberry jam was outstanding.

Sadly, after this last visit I won't be running back. It's always packed and that's expected, but the service was way too slowwwwwwwww. I really hope they make these improvements because they have delicious pancakes and killer Bloody-Mary's. 

Food was overpriced but each plate could feed 4 people so you won't be cheated when you see your platter appear. But if you have a hearty appetite or have a car full of linebackers or truckers they will appreciate the portion size.  

Sadly my order wasn't great. My omelet with spinach was the consistency of sponge cake-yucky.  Our waitress forgot to get us water.  So trying to wave her down and find her was wearing me down.

The inside is sorta cute. Comfy Boothe's and fun colors. Sort of a night club coloring but more if a diner vibe. They did a great job of fitting as much seating as they could and yet its still comfortable because they are booths and not tables on top of each other.
They had a TON of fake flowers all over the place. Even fake trees in the center. I really am not a fan of all that fake flower crap, the colors are usually off of real stuff. The fake stuff gets SO darned dusty, too, and that's just plain gross especially in a restaurant environment. The one fake ivy thing by me didn't feel dusty, but we were still thankful we weren't stuck under one of the trees.
They have a cocktail waitress, which kind of reminds you of old style Vegas. The cocktail we were handed didn't list Amy beer at all, so I had to wait for her to come to our table to find out what they had. 1 draft option, Stella, so I ordered it. Alas, they were out. So I ordered a bottles beer. Wouldn't it be the cocktail waitresses job to know that there's no Stella tonight?

Anyway...
The menu was what you'd expect in a diner, lots of choices and many fried.. And it was about the quality that you'd expect - we had cream cheese stuffed chicken with penne pasta and country fried steak with mashed potatoes. My hubby said the mashed potatoes were average and enjoyed the country fried steak. My cream cheese\/herb stuffed chicken was fried and not too bad. LOADS of pasta, way more than one portion.

We also had dessert - a brownie Sunday for the hubs and strawberry shortcake for me. I asked for some fudge to be added to it and they accommodated (it's super yummy that way).",0,0,0

See HBO Weight of a Nation for a compelling and devastating account of this epidemic. 

That said, the food is tremendous. I sat at the counter alone, waiting for a new friend to pick me up on the day of the marathon (which never came to pass due to the 2-10PM closure of the Strip). I recommend sitting at the counter whether you are alone or with one other person. 

The grilled chicken salad with a half avocado is enough to feed a family of four. They have salads, sandwiches (the club sandwich was beautiful), omelets made with 12 eggs (Maserati is popular) and onion rings which looked life-changing. 

Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared. 

Service is great but be prepared for 30 or more minute wait for lunch or breakfast. 

For those watching bill, this is a great choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner . It's open 24 hours and serves three meals all day. 

They have silly tropical cocktails which I didn't try. 

I was a bit adventurous and tried a salad with pear-cilantro vinaigrette which I didn't like. It was far too sweet. The chicken and blue cheese very good but I was in agonizing pain from being out with my luggage and unable to reach Vdara. 

It reminds me a bit of Esau's in Santa Barbara at roughly the same price point.

When I arrived, I thought, ""Ok, maybe this is just like another burger or steak place like Applebees or Chili's"". 

Walking through the doors though, was a whole other world. It definitely resonates Las Vegas.

In the reception area you will discover slot machines, mirrored walls with lots of blue and purple neon lights outlining the different segmented areas.

On the right side of the restaurant is standard seating for groups, families, etc. decorated in some nice greenery.

As I walked towards the entrance to the left of the restaurant, that area is known as the Fireside lounge.

Throughout the lounge are circular table settings with a fireplace in the middle. The atmosphere reminds me of what I would imagine of the early heydays of Las Vegas. It was appropriate to dress up to the nines and hit the town and I imagine this lounge to be reminiscent of that era.

I was there to enjoy some drinks with my other Zapponian co workers and we ended up ordering some food as well.

The wings were good but I'll be honest, the drinks took a little long to arrive. I ended up opening two tabs and ordered from the bar.

Other than that, I had a great time.

When first entering, I could hear the ""Awws"" from the girls as they noted the neon lights, blossoming trees, and ambience inside. Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.

Ended up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:

-Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn't enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese

-Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm

-Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.

-Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake

Super filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.

*Note: Apparently if we would have told them it was our friend's b-day, we would have gotten a pretty large sundae, but we had difficulty moving ourselves afterwards, so probably a good idea that we didn't let that go to waste by telling them :P",2,2,2

This time I enjoyed a Spinach Salad with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy French-style Dressing (although Hot Bacon Dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine Gyros with soothing cool cucumber Tzaki Sauce, tomatoes, and White Onions.  The large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on Red Potato Salad.  

Other guests in my party savored a Gourmet Chicken Salad, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, and Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, and crispy Hash Browns, along with an excellent warm Bran Muffin that I sampled.

This name should be changed to ""The Frozen Walmart Sampler"" We've had higher quality food from CVS. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, we were presented with a bottle of pond water. And at $34 it felt equivalent to a punch in the tooth. I enjoy the taste of nose bleeds better. Our entrees were Gyros & a rack of pork ribs. When I say Gyros, I mean dried out sanitary towels that wouldn't even satisfy the drunkest person. I'd rather wither away in the Vegas dessert than eat these Gyros that were wrapped in a loaf of bread. And as for the pork ribs, I've seen more quality meat on a stray Afghan dog. The ribs were smothered in what can only be described as Goodwill's branded barbecue sauce.

It's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing. 

The service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.

We wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!

We had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. 

One of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. It's just neat to watch it in action.",5,1,2

The hash browns were undercooked and tasted like warm frozen nastiness...& the omelet was totally undercooked with 0 taste.  

Sent my meal back & didn't have the courage to order another meal.  

Anyhow, if desperate, I would do late night run in like I do when I'm LA at 'Mels'; but not a fan (maybe just a bad one time experience).  

Service was solid and other customer's meals looked decent, so again shall give Ol'Pep the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I was unlucky...

I would suggest keep it simple sin city & order basic stuff here - the bacon was good! lol",0,0,2

You mostly have to go to Fremont Street to get that kind of vibe.

Best explanation I've heard given to describe this place is that ""it's like having dinner inside of a giant disco glitter ball"", and for the most part, that is fairly accurate. The purple-and-pink neon, the shimmery walls, and the over-the-top bar\/lounge is one place you've got to see to believe!

The food isn't terrible, but not as great as the ambiance.  And the menu is HUUUUGE, much like many of the portions. I'd be shocked if anyone could go through that WAR AND PEACE-sized list and declare, ""I can't find anything I like."" Be prepared NOT to hear that, but know that if you're not into Texas-sized servings, you WILL be taking home a doggie bag.

The Fireside Lounge is a bar that is adjacent.  I believe it is a full bar.  Usually a cocktail waitress walks around the restaurant to take bar orders.

Peppermill is on the pricey side, but portions are very, very large to help make up for it.  2 people can definitely share one meal and both get full.

Finally decided to try it after reading all the reviews.  I enjoyed the look of the place, and the lounge is small, but kind of cool.

Don't know what all the 5 stars are for, perhaps for the look of the establishment, couldn't have been for the food.  The food was just okay.  I ordered eggs, sausage links and hash browns (they don't serve home fried potatoes - what a shame).  I was disappointed that the sausage links are turkey.  They also tasted like nasty.  My hash brown potatoes were cold.

Our service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed to prefer spending more time at other tables than ours.  I never got that second cup of coffee I asked for during the meal, only when I asked for the check did she ask if I still wanted more coffee.  Really?  We also asked for extra napkins and condiments, and towards the very end of our meal they came.  

One last thing.  I ordered a Bloody Mary at the lounge while waiting to eat breakfast.  For the price, you'd think it would be fantastic.  Not.  Plain tomato juice and a splash of booze.  It tasted like I was drinking plain tomato juice.  I was very, very disappointed, sitting in those very, very uncomfortable chairs at the bar.

My overall opinion is to stay away from the place, as it serves up food just a notch below Denny's.  It's bloody Mary's are terrible.  Both the food and the drinks are overpriced for what you're receiving, especially compared to other restaurants.  The service was for me terrible, especially when noticing that how they treat you like shit, then dote on others around you.      If you're going to cook and serve food, at least cook and serve it the same for each customer.  Not specific ones.

They seem to pat themselves on the back for having a restaurant with a lounge that has survived there for awhile (just an observation from the menu).  All I have to say is people are idiots if they keep coming back.  Over priced food and drinks.  Underwhelming flavor.  Terrible service.  Trust me, you'd be better off at McDonald's.",1,1,0

It's got two sides, diner with the full menu, then the ""lounge"" with the water\/fire pit. I think your best bet is to go at the end of your night, when you're a little munchy, get a few appetizers and a nightcap then cab it home as the sun comes up.",0,0,0

A work colleague and I discovered this place while researching new places to eat during a convention. We ended up eating here at least one meal every day of the trip. Excellent service, extremely generous portions and exceptional food. It's no wonder this place has been around so long. The atmosphere itself is a mix between a 70s lounge and an 80s arcade. Very cool. Plus they serve liquor, which is a huge plus. I found the Bloody Mary, while quite generous in size, a little lacking in flavor for my tastes. The Coronaritas however were completely awesome. Enjoyed a few of them in the Fireside Lounge while awaiting our table on several occasions. Portions were huge and we couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was compared to the hotel restaurants further down the strip. We'll definitely be putting this place into the rotation on our next trip.",1,0,0

As others have said, the food is good, no matter what you order, and the portions are huge! The fruit plate, for instance, is large enough for 2 or more people. I love the ambiance of the neon lighting, the fake cherry trees, and the friendly staff. It's just so Vegas!  The cocktail waitresses wear these long, flowing black dresses and come into the restaurant from the lounge to take your drink orders. If you want to really get crazy with the drinks, order a Scorpion...it comes in a huge bowl with straws and is meant to be shared! You gotta see it to believe it! I shared one with my nephew and his wife and it was amazing. 

The Fireside Lounge is a trip all by itself. It looks to me like something out of the 1970's: shag carpeting, and a main sunken seating area around a flaming fountain. There are video screens everywhere showing music videos.  I have come here numerous times on dates, with friends, after photo shoots, etc. Just kicked back and had a drink (or two or three) and ordered appetizers. Again, love those friendly, attentive cocktail waitresses dressed in classy black!

Aside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN.

From the outside it doesn't really look like much but once you step in, it's like entering a different world. 

The inside was really cool because everything was bright and colorful, yet still had a dimly-lit feeling. The bright neon lights and the light above our table didn't make it seem as dark as it felt. I really dig the ambience to this place. 

I ordered the pork loin and eggs. The dish consisted of 4 pan-fried pork cutlets, hash browns, your choice of toast, and 3 eggs of any style (I went with poached eggs). The pork loin was soft and tender. I'm sometimes hesitant to order pork dishes (especially pan-fried pork loin) because they run the risk of being hard, dry, and unappealing. The way the chefs cooked the pork here made the pieces easy to cut, and retain most of the natural juices and flavor. Bravo!

The hash brown shreds are bigger in size than most places that serve similar diner food. The poached eggs were alright, and is best eaten with the sourdough toast.

3.5*  Unless you eat at McDonalds or a food court, there is no cheap meal in Vegas anymore, at least not on the strip. Prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. Peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. And it's open 24\/7.

It's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. Think purple neon lights and trees inside. Waitresses clad in Hawaiian-theme uniforms. This is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. That said, I only come here for breakfast.

*Fruit Plate with Banana Nut Bread ($13.25): This is literally a basket full of fresh fruit--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.

*Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.

*Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.

*Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option. 

It's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. If you want to challenge yourself, get the French Toast Collage with four wedges of French toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. Eat yourself to a coma. Quantity certainly supersedes quality here. It's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. Service is quick and friendly. It's a no-frill place on the strip north of Wynn between Encore and Riviera. Crowd range from divey to genteel retired. Get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10.",1,1,1

Everyone and their momma's baby's daddy's first cousin kept saying how good the food was; like toe curling good(allegedly). So my traveling buddy and I decided to get a early breakfast here after a night of debauchery on the strip. The restaurant had a late 80's Magnum PI type vibe going with the decor. I could dig it. It was cute. We were seated and promptly given menus. I ordered a typical breakfast(scrambled eggs and pancakes, hash browns). My traveling partner ordered  steak, eggs, and hash browns. Our food came out in a timely manner and the portions were more than sufficient, but when I say those were the gummiest eggs I have ever tasted..... babeee, terrible. I really don't want to believe they were powered but those couldn't have been fresh or the hen was past her prime. The pancakes were equally eek and they felt like bricks hitting the bottom of my stomach, just heavy and tasteless no matter how mud I tried to make them edible, I just gave up.

My buddy was a little indisposed( i.e a little hammered), so she actually didn't eat her steak until the next day, but she said it was delicious!.

The menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  

Service is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. 

I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. 

Oh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.

The chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?

I was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.

Your staff and your food are worthless, lazy, expensive and just plain mediocre.  I'm so sick of the staff treating me like a worthless piece of crap, so I'm through with you.  I'm tired of paying 40-50 bucks for a meal where I have to practically beg for someone to refill my iced tea and get snubbed the entire night.

We used to be a great team. I'd stumble in drunk, eat your huge greasy food portions, and then get even more drunk off your overpriced scorpions.  Later you stopped caring about me by always overcooking every meal and then you eventually stopped using seasoning.  Finally, your staff just stopped paying attention to me.

If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.

My husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate.

Luckily I was able to come back to Peppy-mill. First rule of vacationing in Vegas or in general is to fully explore where you are so you don't have to go thru an epic battle to get back to it later. I had been here the week before to spend some quality time in the lounge. While you can order food in the lounge (not just the fruit salad in your drink), the restaurant is a whole different experience. I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.

I've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with. 

The food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of ""mash up"" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants. 

Something happened\/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given. 

So, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering. 

One of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out ""as friends."" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite? 

So, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2\/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right? 

There was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm.",3,3,3

No, it's not new, extremely clean, or filled with gorgeous modern decor, it is more along the lines of Vegas in the 70's, at least everything I can imagine that was good about Vegas in the 70's:)  I once heard that this is one of the oldest operating businesses in Vegas but I'm not sure if that is true.

Their bloody mary's are delicious, the portions are large, and they have a large selection of finger type snack foods,  which is good after a drunkin' or somehow otherwise intoxicated evening:)  The service is always top notch and the waitresses, no matter what age, are all attractive and wear long black dresses.  Yes, that may seem cheesy but personally, I think it is unique and I love it!

Everything from the red velvet seating to the hot tub like fire place contraption to the mirrored walls with christmas looking lights everywhere help add to the perfect ""old school"" Vegas type of experience.

I ""heard"" that lots of ""dancers"" like to hang out here after their shifts are over at the various gentleman's clubs....wink, wink:)",2,0,0

Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of ""Old Vegas"" got me in the mood to try more classics.

Worth the wait.

The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was ""Yes"" and ""Please"".

I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.

This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.

I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.",7,3,7

This was our first time here. We walk in. No hostess at the stand. 2 of them talking amongst each other arguing... what were they arguing about? They were arguing about which one of them was going to seat us. We can here them. ""Its your turn!"" ... ""No, its your turn!"" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe.

Finally seated. Our waiter, waitress and another guy was really nice.. no problems with them or the food.

As im paying the bill (have to take the tab by the entrance) and there are slot machines. More kids and they're sitting in front of the slot machines. Some climbing on the chairs.

2. French Toast - 6 slices of toast.  nothing spectacular

A friend had told me long ago that I needed to go here and I've been meaning to, but finally made it on this last trip.    SO worth it!  First of all, I think it's probably CRAZY on weekends because we were there on a Wednesday morning and there was a crowd of people... luckily only a 15 minute wait, though.  Perfect timing for us to head into the Fireside Lounge for a Bloody Mary!

The Fireside is AWESOME.  It's so 70s Vegas... all shiny and neon.  There is a big fire and water element in the middle with couches around it in a circle.  Love it.  The Bloody Mary was huge, but not so strong.  I just totally loved the atmosphere and it was nice for us because it was also pretty empty, so we had the fire pit to ourselves.

When they called our names, we were sat in a big booth and ordered our breakfast.  The husband had a French Dip and ordered the fruit as his side and WOW, it was a huge bowl of nice fruit, including a whole cut up banana, strawberries and melons.    Very nice. I was jealous.  I wanted to try a bunch of things so ended up getting scrambled eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy.  It was WAY too much food, so I only ate about a third of it.  The ""three eggs side"" was more like about 5 eggs.  The biscuits and gravy were good, but not great and a huge plate.  I think they should do a smaller version.  I wasn't that fond of the hash browns either.  Only the very top was crunchy and the pieces are just too big for hash browns.  But, otherwise, I enjoyed the food.  

Our server was attentive and the food came out quick.  Cost for food was about $30, but I over ordered.  We really enjoyed our meal and the whole experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to the Peppermill!",0,0,0

I ordered a soup and a bagel today which was quite delicious, but the service was really slow. I couldn't believe how long it took. 

After finishing my bagel, I decided to get dessert. I always get the colossal sundae here and it's usually amazing, but they kept messing up my order. I asked them to change the vanilla ice cream to chocolate, put chocolate syrup, and to remove the nuts. When it came, the  ice cream was vanilla and there was nuts. So I sent to back, and asked them to fix it. When it came back, they changed the ice cream and removed the nuts, but there was now a giant brownie and it was covered in hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup. 

I was very disappointed with their service. Compared to what I was used to, this was terrible. But the manager was nice enough to remove the ice cream from our bill.

My first visit to Peppermill was in the morning after a long night. The wait is usually an hour plus on a weekend morning, so plan accordingly. In my case, planning accordingly means heading straight to the lounge and ordering a Bloody Mary. I don't want to say that Peppermill served up the best bloody I've had in Vegas so far, but I have to say that because it's true. Not too watery, just the right amount of spice, and that wor-chest-chire sauce, that nobody can really ever spell or say correctly, took it to a whole new level of tomato glory. Once our table was called, we finished our cocktails, grabbed our bucket of Coronas, and had breakfast. Eggs and bacon with an english muffin. Delish with a capital D and my perfect equation for curing a hangover.

My most recent adventure brought me back late night. Crystal was behind the bar again and mixed me up a blended cocktail called the Chocolate Chip Cookie. Heaven, dessert, however you want to describe it, it's darn good. Went for the Rueben at 12:30am and I'm so glad I did. The ratio of meat to sauerkraut was impressive. The last minute addition to order a random drink off the cocktail list based on the name you liked seemed like a great idea at the time. I opted for the Snuggler, a hot chocolate with Rumplemintz, which was tasty but wildly unnecessary at that hour. 

Peppermill, I'll see you again real soon.",27,16,25

Yes the decor is cheesy and out dated but my son was in love with all the neon lights and my husband was in love with all the short skirted waitresses and massive cleavage of the cocktail girl.",0,0,0

I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. Markus and Miyoko ordered salads. When the salads came.. it really looked like 3 salads combined into one serving. Miyoko ordered the steak and mushroom salad that looked tasty.. Markus's salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it. All of us were shocked of how big the portions were.

We walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. That was ok since it's Christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. But we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. 
Our waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). 
It came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! 
So we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!

All in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant \/diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations\/ ambiance!

After any buffet, Egg Works, and Hash House were all shot down for having too large of portion sizes, I finally sold them on the Peppermill, largely by promising them neon.

Pros: 
 - Damn tasty diner food and freely flowing cups of coffee. This is all I really ask for in a solid Brunch Experience
-Super friendly staff and prompt service, and no problems with slightly different orders and keeping coffee coming.
- The look on my friends' faces when they realized this place didn't have small portions either! Oh noes, mah dietz. I laughed and laughed and laughed\/

Cons:
- Long wait, really with no where to sit and wait. We hung out on a curb and were frequently asked if we needed a cab.
- Prices were a bit on the high side relative to the awesomeness of the food. Got the impression I was paying for the neon. Wasn't too bad, but also nothing to compose a sonnet over.

Overall Verdict:
- Yummy classic diner food in a classically vegas atmosphere. Will return when hungover, or with out of town and unadventurous guests. Won't be on the favorites anytime list, but certainly not shabby.",2,0,0

I ended up with the corned beef hash. As I mentioned above, the portion was huge. The corned beef hash wasn't really my thing and would probably try something different next time. The lemon-cranberry muffin that came with the entree was bomb though!

If you are really hungry and wanted something to eat, I would definitely recommend The Peppermill!

Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean). 

We decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw)

I did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool. I kind of wish we sat on that side and enjoyed my bday breakfast but honestly, I just wanted to eat and head out to downtown to gamble.

Overall, it was a cool experience to check out but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Especially when you have so many other cool spots to eat at in Vegas.

Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2.

Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: ""Man, I would love a good salad."" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)

Following some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.

In addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a ""romantic flaming pool"", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it ""heaven"".

When a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas.

Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that.

Oh what to do?!!?  Yep, open up Yelp and let my taste buds do the walking.  

The closest place that wasn't fancy or didn't require a reservation was The Peppermill.  As we walked past the place (had to get to a crosswalk) it looked like a fun place to have dinner and the rest of you Yelpers had it at 4-stars...so we gave them a shot.  From the outside, the place didn't look like much more than a fancy NJ Diner...just with more neon.

When we got inside I realized the place was bigger than it seemed, but it STILL looked like a neon bathed NJ diner...so I was hoping for a good meal at a good price.  The menu here is pretty large, but we were here for a couple of steaks...nothing too fancy, but something that would sit in my stomach for the 5+ hour flight home (what were we thinking?).  Ernesto came over and took our drink orders and was back quickly for the food orders.  We skipped the appetizers (though the meal did come with salad) and we ordered a couple of NY Strips...my buddy added a side of fettuccini alfredo and I stuck with my potato...and we both also got a side of cooked, marinated mushrooms.  We waited a bit for Ernesto to come back with our salads and I asked him 2x for water.  When the salads arrived a waitress named Gabby delivered them and I asked for more water (this time it took about 45 seconds).

Ok, I know what you're thinking...these idiots ordered steaks at what amounts to a fancy diner?!?!  Yep...don't judge a book by its cover.  My steak, though a little small, was actually quite delicious.  Cooked with just some salt and cracked pepper it was tasty and done just medium.  My co-worker had to send his back as his was still mooing, but it came back quickly and was more to his liking.  For some reason, Ernesto disappeared and we ended up with Gabby as our waitress.  Now, I'm not one to judge, but this being Vegas and all, I don't think this was the only job Gabby had...Gabby was very friendly, quite a beautiful young woman, and honestly a great waitress.  I hope she ended up taking the tip instead of Ernesto who did nothing more than take our order.

Gonna give The Peppermill 3.5 stars and have to round down.  The undercooked steak, the disappearing waiter, the multiple requests for water...the service could have been better (though it got better with Gabby).",5,6,6

i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.

ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs.

*Eggs Benedict: 3 poached eggs (poached medium) on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns ($14.25)
*Joe's San Francisco Special: traditional classic of scrambled eggs with spinach, pork sausage, ground beef and onion, seasoned and served on crispy hash browns and smothered in a golden cheese sauce, served with wheat toast ($13.95)
*Maserati Omelet: a superb omelet bursting with sausage, jack and cheddar cheeses and mushrooms, smothered in a perfect italian meat sauce, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, served with hash browns and your choice of toast ($13.95)
*Side of Bacon: 5 pieces ($5.50)
*Coffee ($3.50) √ó4
*Pepsi ($3.50)

I got the Joe's special. I always order this when I go out to breakfast, so it was nice having a Vegas twist on it. I liked the addition of the cheese sauce. I don't always like potatoes, so I kinda wished they didn't put the whole scramble on top of the hash browns. I was able to eat around it though. I tried my friends maserati omelet. I adore meat sauce, so I enjoyed this twist on an omelet. Tasted like spaghetti bolognese in breakfast form. I also got a side of bacon cuz I adore bacon. A good size as it came with five pieces.

I didn't know this until a friend told us, but apparently this diner has been featured in quite a few films, etc. I thought it was a cool little bit of trivia. I didn't recognize it, but one of the more prominent films mentioned was Casino.

Good place to go if you're super hungry as their breakfast portions are huge. I could only finish a quarter of my plate. They have a nice varied menu, so there's something for everyone. I heard there's a fireside lounge area of Peppermill as well. I'd love to come back and check that out.",24,17,25

It is a Sunday stop before we leave Sin City.  Back in 2005 a buddy of mine brought me her on a birthday weekend.  It was a Sunday just before we headed back home to CA on a hot Summer July morning.  We were completely smashed from the night before and he said lets have a bloody Mary.  

OMG he came back from the fireside with these wonderfully spicy B Mary's and I was hooked.

On this morning I had the tostada omelette.  I had asked my son to share his order with me but he said no I can eat dad.  So I challenged him.  Being that I have been here several times I knew the portions were large.  So I ordered my own and told him he better eat it all.  Guess what he did! He threw back at me and said ""you better eat all of yours"".  So about half way he gave up I didn't show it but I was done too.  The waitress came by and asked him if he wanted his, he said ""no"" I was like ""what happen""?  Waitress "" don't worry honey there's 10 eggs in there you did a good job!"" 

Jaw drop! quite in the restaurant you could hear a pin drop.  The challenge was on!  As i cut through the omelet I could see the layers of tostada, ground beef, guacamole sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  Its warm goodness got me so full so quickly.  It got hot in there too, the salsa had just enough bite.  I ate it all and rubbed the victory in my sons face and he laughed, said ""your gonna be sick!""

Go to the Peppermill great food drinks and experiences.",5,5,7

And I guess I still do, but I was really bummed when I ordered a $9.50 margarita and got what tasted like a leftover margarita.  You know like when you make a margarita and have some leftover in the shaker and all the ice melts and then you drink it sometimes against your better judgement...oh sorry.  Yeah, I know what a bad margarita tastes like and I know at almost  $10 a pop that shit better taste good.  So I was really pissed when the server wouldn't take the drink back.  She said that's why they suggest the 50 cent upgrade when they take your order.  I'm sorry, shouldn't a $9 margarita taste pretty good to begin with?  I asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said YES!!!  At this point,(when i thought I wouldn't be getting my money back) I said sure throw some more tequila(and possible spit from the bartender) on my shitty drink.  The drink comes back and Quel Surprise! still shit!  Fuming inside, i thought I'd try my luck with the manager.  She explained that it is their policy not to return drinks and that's how it is at most places on the strip, but she was kind enough(and seeing that i had barely touched the drink) to take the drink off the bill.

For starters, the ""greeters"" were gossiping when we walked in, and halfway acknowledged us as they led us to our table. I realize they frequently have drunk people coming in after bars let out (2am-6am ish) but it's midnight and we are sober.

Our waitress was friendly, but couldn't tell me what percentage of fat was in the ground beef they use for the burgers. The cook went to the back and read the box, and said it was 75% fat. Haha, ok. That doesn't exist in real life, so I asked the waitress if she could please check, even though I correctly suspected they meant 25% fat. The kitchen staff appeared to be overly annoyed that I even asked, let alone requested a second look. Excuse me for caring about what I put into my body. At any rate, 75\/25 chuck? Not exactly what I was expecting based on their trumped-up description on their menu.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. It was good, until a large glob of what appeared to be someone's spit dripped out of the bottom of my wrap. My stomach turned and I couldn't eat another bite. I felt like vomiting as I used the wooden skewer to inspect the substance on the edge of my plate, which clearly was not a food product. Yep, definitely spit. Thankfully I spotted it before I bit into that area of the wrap!!!

I told the waitress, and she tried her best to act surprised. She told the manager, who came over to defend her staff, and tell me over and over ""they don't do that"" there. Right. Angry employees spit in food everyday in all types of restaurants. The manager offered something else (no thanks, don't need more spat-upon dishes). But, she didn't seem apologetic, nor was she able to explain what it was, if not spit. What ingredient in a grilled buffalo chicken wrap is the consistency and color of someone's nasal drip? None.

Nothing more was said, they just removed it from the bill. I will absolutely never return, and I will vehemently steer friends away from this place.

     Now I only get to visit once a year, since I no longer live just a few hours from Vegas. Some visits have been better than others for sure, but I don't think I've ever walked out unhappy. This time I had the Mediterranean omelet ($14), which was good and the creme brulee ($7), which was OK.

The Good:
Not only was the omelet huge but more importantly it was good. There was plenty of pretty good quality shrimp and a fair dose of crab. The Hollandaise sauce was flavorful and complimented it well without taking away from the flavor of the shrimp and crab.

The Bad:
The only complaint, and it's not a severe one, is the waitress didn't do a very good job of keeping up with our drinks. It was just bad enough to be annoying, not bad enough to be frustrating.

The Indifferent:
The hash browns that came with the omelet were fairly unremarkable but I have to warn you, while I will eat them, I'm not a huge fan of hash browns so you might want to take my opinion on this with a little caution.

Pink and blue neon lights, disco ball ceiling and of course the fireplace. It's a place that you would never find in Boston, where I was visiting from. Maybe that's the reason why I loved it, it seemed like a million miles away from anywhere else that I had been.

We sat lounge side and ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was decent, my only complaint was the drinks that we had packed very little punch which was ok, being that it was probably 2:00 PM when we went there. It was still a great place to relax before a big night on the town.

The blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)

Before almost every casino, bar, and restaurant either became 5 stars, a total dump, or was owned by some big conglomerate, there was something in between. The Peppermill, my friends, is just that. 

The Peppermill is a piece of history. Nostalgia if you will. It brings back memories of days gone by. It's nothing fancy. It's simply an old school diner, with old school vinyl booths, waitresses, and colors in a non-pretentious setting that probably hasn't changed in some time. The food is typical diner fare and nothing that will blow your socks off, but I must say that my Denver omelette reminds me of something that even Fred Flinstone would have a hard time finishing. 

The prices, although more than an average diner, aren't too bad, especially compared to some of the lush Vegas breakfast buffets. The Peppermill is located down the strip in front of the Riviera, which means having to fight large crowds and hungover tourists is minimal and an added bonus!

It is located by the Riviera & Circus Circus on the strip, so people are able to walk off their food afterwards because there is a lot of food coming your way!!!  

1. Be prepared to wait-Giving any place in Vegas that is good and that does not have a reservation option, be prepared to wait.  There is not much seating areas up front so they will offer the lounge area to wait (highly recommended!) but usually everyone is waiting outside.

2. There are large booths & typical bar seating-There is plenty of room to sit and the decor is straight up vegas style!  If I blinked twice I would have thought I was in a party bus with trees!  I loved the seating arrangement and everyone was in a good mood and can easily talk to the booth next to you!

3. Waitresses were awesome (both times!) They let you know what is great on the menu and I did get everything in a timely manner...even though they were slammed!

4. Food for Days- For the first round, I received the breakfast pancake platter and the size of everything is incredibly huge!  You pay around 13-14 dollars, but it is worth it (especially if your hotel room has a fridge, you will have leftovers!)  The second round I got the French Toast Ambrosia...this I highly recommend!! French Toast with a whole bunch of ""fresh"" fruit on top smothered in whipped cream (if you want) with blueberry sauce!!! YUUUMMM!

Where to start.  How about how our waitress didn't show up to our table for about 20 minutes.  Much of the awfulness of this place does have to do with possibly the worst person who has ever called herself a waitress.  I'm not sure how many tables she was responsible for but the wait at the door would have been at least 20 minutes less if she was even remotely competant.  The food was below average and cold and not cheap.  Denny's quality with gourmet prices...no thank you.

The service is quite fast and there is quite a few options to choose from. At 3AM I opted for a cup of coffee and ""Joe's San Francisco Special."" Basically, thats a few eggs, spinach, onions, ground beef & sausage, and topped with cheese sauce. Originally it includes hash browns mixed in there but I asked for them to set that aside since I wasn't so sure I wanted to eat them. You do get an option of toast but I chose to try their warm blueberry muffin! I'm so glad I went with that because it was the best part of the entire meal.  

The prices for breakfast are along the lines as a typical diner such as Norms or Denny's but their plates are much much larger here. Honestly, if you were to split a plate with someone, I think you would be better off. 

The coffee was watered down but then again if they're making so much of it, I can imagine this is not their main concern.

Vegas may have grown and evolved but this place stays the same. I have eaten here many times over the years. Recently I stopped in for breakfast and met Mary the night manager. I could not believe how nice she was considering all of the crazy drunk people she has to deal with during those hours. 

I stopped in to grab a carry out menu but they were out of them. Mary grabbed me a real menu and a pencil and paper so I could write down my order for the next day. I told you she was nice.  I called the next morning to place my order and Mary remembered me. I did a veggie omlette but I went all Sally from ""Harry met Sally"" on them. I went egg whites, no salt, no mushrooms and substituted to Swiss cheese.  Yeah I was that pain in the butt special order guy. I even asked for crispy hash browns. Mary took my order on the phone and even read it all back to me. She also told me my food would be ready in 10 minutes. 

I was finishing my run and headed over to grab my food. I was amazed at how fast I was able to get my food. Mary even went out of her way to get my hash browns really crispy. I saw her giving a little shout towards the cook. You go Mary!

My food was really hot and there was tons of it. I actually couldn't eat it all and saved half of it in my hotel fridge. Hey it's a desert out here, so food hoarding is acceptable here!  Everything was great. The hash browns were really rich.  I think they were cooked in butter. Mmmm...butter!!! I did have to use a few napkins to soak up the oil spill. The omlette was cooked perfectly but again it was huge. Big enough for two people to share. So keep that in mind when you eat here!

Worth a visit.  The food is good.  Some items slightly rich.  I've so far had a few different versions of their Eggs Benedict.  This last one was a Steak Benedict.  It was ok, next time I'll take the ham.

Plus they messed up on our order. Got us a well done steak instead of medium well. The waitress was pleasant and apologetic and said manger will be right over when asked it to be redone. The manager there did not even come up to the table. Instead walked half way and turned around. I guess we scared him. Took them over 40 minutes (yes I was timing them) took get the food made to order. The waitress apologized and said that we won't be charged. But instead was charged for it and said the manager decided not to charge us for the ""second steak""!! Wow!! How sweet of him not to charge us for what was a piece of jerky!!  If you charge $20 for breakfast food, it's your responsibility to make sure it's cooked correctly!! 

When we do come to vegas we always make sure we eat here. But never again are we coming back here especially after this horrible experience. Very very slow service.

I called and the women on the phone (who I assume is a manager, Peggie maybe?) said they won't take the order by phone, I have to come in, order and wait. This is ridiculous. I've never heard of a fast casual restaurant, not willing to take a pickup order by phone. When I told the woman on the phone that it sounds like they don't want my business, she basically said I'm sorry. 

Well, never going there again, they just lost a 20 year customer because they have some sort of outdated and impractical ideology.

I have tried to hit up Peppermill on my last TWO Vegas visits, but circumstances prevented a drop-in. Looks like third time's a charm, because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill, and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two.

Peppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe, so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that). Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling, lush fake foliage abound, vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table, while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast. No, seriously. IMAGINE.

Both mornings, we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious ""Fireside Lounge"" door. The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here, as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas, and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit. It feels good for about 18 second before it's absolutely too hot to be down there, but you don't leave because it's just. too. cool. Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby's head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya!), served by a young lady in a satin prom dress, before being whisked away to your dining experience.

Breakfast on both mornings was deelish. Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict, while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo. Both were extra tasty. On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility, though it wasn't on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass. I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR! 

Pretty much I wanna be here like 'erry day.",4,7,4

Too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. NO disneyland but one of those things see Vegas could drum up and pull off. 

I ended up getting the maserati omelette. Not like motherload of omelettte. It was smothered with lot of goodies. The best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. I barely finish half of it. It came with tasty hash browns. I enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. Along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. I went with the blueberry muffin.

Peppermill is an institution in Vegas.   Walk in here and you walk back in time. There is no question about where you are - 1970s. Vegas.  Neon lights.  Crushed purple velvet.  Mirrors. Vintage waitress outfits.   Worries left at the door.  Yuppp, this place is da bomb.  Our friends who are locals brought us here, and good thing they did because I never would have found it, even though I Yelp and read Chowhound extensively.  Actually we walked by it a few times (we stayed at the Hilton about a block away) and I did wonder what the story was with the place...there is something so non-descript and mysterious about it.  Curiosity solved - we came for breakfast on Sunday morning, whole place is packed with a crowd waiting at the slot machines. Wait doesn't take long though. Look around and everyone is drinking  Bloody Marys.  I had the Tequila Sunset and French Toast with fruit and boysenberry syrup - delish!

Not so now, I had buddies of mine coming into town Friday morning and of course they could not check in to the hotel because it was too early and they were both starving for some food.
I wanted to stay on the strip and suddenly the Peppermill came into my mind, I know they are open 24\/7 and they serve breakfast.
So upon arrival (it was around 10am) we rolled up to the Pepermill and were greeted with a 30 min wait time and the reception area was packed with people waiting.  
Then I remembered the lounge out back that serves some of the best Bloody Mary's I can remember having, so off we went to spend our wait time in the lounge.  man I'm glad I did, it was exactly like I remembered it pink and purple neon everywhere and the small water fire pit in the middle....Classic.
Our waitress came and took out orders quickly and then returned with them just as fast, the Bloody Mary was exactly like I remembered them and you get at plethora of choices for your vodka, anyway we had two drinks each while we waited and was then called to our table.
Our waitress gave us ample time to look and order from the menu which I was surprised at seeing as the place was packed, I was  expecting her to rush us and get us out of there.
the portions are HUGE! and can easily be shared, I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs, there must have been a pound of corned beef with a crispy crust and three, yes three fried eggs on top.   
Mmmmm The corned beef was crispy on the outside but once you cut into it, it was moist and creamy then once you cut open one of the eggs and the yolk mixes into the corned beef I was in heaven.
I wish it was closer to my house so I could go more often but for anyone on the strip and bear in mind the Peppermill is located quite far down the north of the strip across from Circus Circus and the old Riviera it is still a must go to for a great meal ANYTIME of the day or night.",0,0,0

I love the 50's diner look from the outside, the massive portions of virtually anything you can chow down either at a table or at the counter in the restaurant. Nachos are great, huge and perfect for that: ""it's 4am and I need food, stat"" moment; best shared with a friend or 12. Breakfast foods are equally large portions: pancake lovers rave over their stacks; many of my burger loving friends have raved about the burgers. I usually have a gynormous salad, while iceberg isn't my favorite, it is more than adequate here (I never leave without a to-go box) Love that they are open 24\/7 and the kitschy decor in the diner. There can be relatively long waits during breakfast hours and at seemingly random times. Worth the wait. Also, it is easy walking distance from many spots on the Strip, so you can walk off some of those drinks\/nachos. Recently walked from TI & Bellagio. 

Just the diner side would make this great to this NYer who misses a diner. But then...you walk into the Fireside Lounge and are transported into the 1970's (overheard a man telling his wife ""it looks like a den of iniquity"")  Velvet couches in the round with flat screens playing old school videos, plus the famous floating fireplace add to the unique ambience; there are even matchbooks at your tables. There are gaming spots at bar, if that's your thing. 

Drinks follow the throwback theme along with Mai Tais, Scorpions & other ""Girl Drink Drunk"" offerings (check out classic Kids in the Hall skit on You Tube, riff on Days of Wine and Roses but very Vegas) and unique dessert themed libations. There's frequently a roving photographer to present a memento of what always turns out to be a good time for local and tourists alike. 

The waitresses wear long black cocktail dresses, and do the classic ""Bunny dip"" to place coasters and serve -- reminiscent of the old Playboy Clubs -- there's a decent array of  bar food and appetizers. On my last trip in April we had Caprese Salad (very good) Shrimp Cocktail (a ok) Chicken Quesadillas (really good, very flaky but took forever to come out) and something else I didn't eat but my friend enjoyed it. Drinks are potent, service can be a tad slow, but friendly. Our water glasses were always filled, drinks refreshed and waitress did keep in touch regarding wayward item. 

The people watching alone is worth a visit. Depending on what time you are there, you'll start to see hungry clubbers, hungry\/thirsty ""dancers "" and just your variety of only-in-Vegas sightings. From about 3AM on it gets really shall we say, eclectic?' 

So, I'm a fan. Always have been, always will be. It is a cool spot to chow down, get your drink on or snuggle up to your honey. Long live The Peppermill!",6,2,3

Based on the jumbo sized portions other Yelpers mentioned, probably to match their jumbo sized booths, the hubby and I shared.  I ordered a small Spinach Salad and he went with the Maserati Omelet.  

While we waited for our food, a photographer came around offering ""free"" pictures.  She came back during our meal with our free postcard picture souvenir and a sales pitch for the larger prints.  It's a nice effort, but a picture in a booth with a window in the background doesn't do it for me...especially for nearly $20 a print!  But I gladly took the freebie.

The omelet was HUGE and served with hashbrowns and an English muffin; the salad was normal sized.  So it was just the right amount of food for the two of us to share.

  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w\/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.

Tacos Del gordo was THE PLACE for an arm-sized burrito and super fresh tacos. Now it's an empty store. Further proving that the SLS Is dead wrong by telling us that ""North is the new South "". (that's a truly a DUMB idea. As is the idea of the SLS itself.  Enjoy it now,  I say it's closed by '19) Next month another classic is done. The Riviera sadly closes.  The landscape changes again.

Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn\/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.

The atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.

We stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.

This was in the 80's, when your parents sent you and your sibling off with a $100 bill each morning to entertain ourselves all day and night at Circus Circus and other hotels. To get around, we'd catch cabs like New Yorkers and would only go back to our hotel when we ran out of money. Parents. They had it so easy back then.

They say you can never go back to the old days, and going to the Peppermill lounge as an adult is that adage personified. (Not that I was in the lounge section as a kid.) Questionable quality of food that's highly recommended as delicious by all their waitstaff (???) strong, strong, STRONG drinks and hilarious dim lighting, accented by the blue pools of flames that the round booths surround.

I know how rich the hot fudge is and it melts the ice cream which is what I was trying to avoid.  I was informed it was large and that the banana split was 8 scoops. That sounded like too much so i went with the colossal sundae. 
   Let me tell you the only thing colossal about my colossal sundae was the colossal amount of hot fudge underneath my 2 scoops and frozen puddle of mush. Probably melted from the hot fudge which i didn't order.  I didn't take a picture but imagine like 2 cups of warm fudge on the bottom. Just gross. 

 So its time to pay, her gyro was fine by the way. We ask for the check after trying very hard to get ahold of our server. We get the bill and another 10 mins goes by waiting for our server to take my card. She only came back after hollering at other staff.  She takes my card and returns with only the receipt. I realize instantly my card is missing , but our server had already skipped off. I go to the restroom when i come back I'm greeted by someone making me show proof of identification to get my card back. I understand they do this sort of thing however i was displeased that our server wasn't capable of just returning my card herself.

The portions are HUGE and staff is very attentive and friendly. The ambiance is very intimately-casual? it's cool to have TREES and lights while dining - there are even complimentary photos! (not sure if this is a daily thing or just on Friday when we went at like 3am)

I got the Peppermill Pastrami Burger and wow. Fresh, cooked well, and they had onion rings as a side option at no extra charge! Onion rings are my favorite kind of rings. They were crunchy and the onion did not slide out when you take a bite. That's a sign of a good ring! The burger was tasty and not overly salty. Pastrami tends to be salty and I was afraid it would be too much, but it was seasoned well and really good. Would eat again!

My partner got the french dip and I only to try one bite because he devoured it. Very flavorful au jus and if my love for onion rings wasn't so strong - I would get the potato salad. Flavorful and fresh tasting. It wasn't heavy like some potato salad can be. It was a cool contrast to the hot sandwich. 

Overall, great dining experience and will be here time and time again for late night eats. But might share a plate next time - the portions are very generous. They also have a cool lounge attached to the restaurant. Poked my head in and it looked like a chill place to hang out.",2,2,1

I have to say the food was good - I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad as the side.  The drinks were good as well and, although the one I ordered had no price listed, I found it reasonable.

The atmosphere was fun - lots of bright lights and funky uniforms for the servers.  With everything stated above, I could give the Peppermill 4 stars, HOWEVER....

The server took FOREVER!!!  We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?  After that it took forever to flag her down... and even after she picked up the check it took her ages to swipe the credit card.

This is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.

As an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time. 

Another thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny. 

The Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Vegas classic.
Retro vibe and feel.
Beautiful lounge.
Huge portions. 

Cons:
Not the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.
Not the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.
Can feel a little bit campy, but it works.

It's a popular spot after partying for diner faire. Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from ""tradition"" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.

As for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast\/muffin\/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?",0,0,0

The only complaint is that it was a bit lite on the seafood and the hashbrowns that came with it. The egg to filling ratio was a bit off as a result and noticeable. There was also a variety of muffins besides the toast if you so choose. A nice option. My wife had the the taco omelet with hashbrowns. It was also very good.

The Peppermill has been around a long time. It's an old school favorite of mine and a go-to restaurant back in the early 2000's. The Peppermill has not changed in years and full of enough neon to have their own Neon Museum.  I love it!!

The food portions tend to be the highlight at the Peppermill.  Every dish is on steroids.  For the bros out there, I don't mean that literally.  They hook it up to the max at the Peppermill and still manage to keep the price per meal very low.  I used to come here for their burgers, fries, nachos, and desserts.  They're all good.  But now, it's all about their 10 egg omelets.  That's not a typo...10 freakin' eggs AND it's still served with toast & hash browns.  I even talked to one of the shift leaders and she stated that most people eat only half of their meals here.  Well, not this guy. I will deMELish their omelets every chance I get.  They're omelets are so good that it would be a shame if I had any leftovers. 

This restaurant is always busy and a wait for a seat should be expected.  The service is top notch as well.  I highly recommend the Peppermill, especially if you're craving a beast of an omelet. 

Just a note...
Some people have mentioned that the Peppermill looks like strip club inside. All that's missing is a stripper pole.  I beg to differ with these people and think they got it backwards.  I think a strip club looks more like a Peppermill.  All that's missing is their 10 egg omelet.

The last time we went was a Saturday night, but there wasn't a wait and many tables were empty, so they weren't slammed. It took over half an hour to get our simple orders of a club sandwich, burger and omelette. The iced tea was stale. The burger was cold, sent back to be put under the heat lamps, but they made a new one, so my starving bf wasn't thrilled. Then the waitress brought the new burger with a small smattering of fries. She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said ""Well, I ordered onion rings anyway..."" She never brought more fries or onion rings. This debacle reminded me of another time I ate there and my burger was frigid, like it was just pulled out of a fridge.

This restaurant contains all of the old classic Vegas glamour that you'd expect in the movies. It was like I had stepped into a scene of a classic movie.

The servers and staff were all super friendly and amazing. We managed to order one round of drinks before our table was ready. 

We get seated on a giant table and the giant menu makes it super hard to pick a meal. I went for a chicken sandwich with fries. My heart really wanted some shortcake with ice cream. It was late and I needed to eat food and dessert wasn't going to cut it. 

Our food starts coming out and the portions are huuuuge! My fries were so super tasty, it's like they had some kind of magical breading on them. The chicken in my sandwich was perfectly cooked. I was able to eat half of my food and I got the rest to-go.

I ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.

Anyways, back to the peppermill.  This place was so awesome.  Neon, glamorous, chromey interior. Just the thing you need after you've been at a gentlemen's club till 7am that same morning.

The reviews were right. The place is very unique with lots of neon lights and spacious tables. The food was great and the portions too big to finish. Service was great and prices very reasonable.

I ordered a sausage, Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.

As always, the peppermill way, my omelet was GYNORMOUSE and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that I'm not into hash browns.

The bar area is fantabulous!!! Dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. It  definitely is something worth checking out!

Walking in here felt like I was walking into a time machine and going back about 30-40 years. The place looks like it has been untouched with the exception of an interesting set of flat panel screen TVs by the lobby entrance. 
Other than that, even the waiter and waitresses all stress fairly different than a typical diner, which gives this place a unique vibe. 

We were sat immediately on a Monday afternoon, but it took a little longer than it should have for our server to come (and mind you, I was slightly hung over and needed a big greasy meal in my belly). 

Our server came (prompt thereafter), but wasn't overly friendly or anything. Just did his job and took care of us with no issues. I ordered a scramble which was huge.... really, EVERYTHING you order here can be easily split with another person. But, it was nice to take it back to the hotel to eat for dinner. 

The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but I think the overall vibe of this place, along with the large portions is why this place is so highly regarded. Oh, and not to mention all of the movies that have scenes inside this restaurant over the years is probably another reason. 

Would I come back here if in Vegas again? Ehhh, most likely not, but I don't have anything really bad to say about it. It's location is certainly not in the most convenient spot if you are staying and walking around the strip. It's just too far north of all the action so taking a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or driving yourself would be the most convenient option. I would imagine once they complete the new Asian-style themed hotel\/casino across the street in a few years that this place will be even more busy.

we went here because the guy at the wynn said this place had good burgers for cheap, and girls walking around in mini skirts.

he was 2 for 2.

the only problem with it was it was just a tad too ghetto for my taste. im not an elitist, hell im not even yelp elite, but still it was just a bit down in the dumps. although i will give it credit, the girls working there were very hot, and the milkshakes were bomb.

we thought our waitress was really cute and wanted to hit on her a bit, so we thought it would be a good idea if we asked about milkshakes. my first friend was in love with this girl and wanted to talk to her, so when she walked up it went like this.

friend 1 (who was in love with her): silence
friend 2: um so we wanted to ask you about the milkshakes
me: uh yeah what flavors do you have?
waitress: strawberry vanila and chocolate

me: well after that we are def. not getting the pink strawberry

We were there to eat and eat we did. The waitress was nice and looked 16 which I kidded her about but she was a good sport and a very good server. I found it to be a good time and I loved the pastrami sandwich (so lean) just writing this review makes me want to go back. I have not had a good pastrami sandwich in a while.

I ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.) I ordered the peppermill breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and it was excellent. WAY better than a Denny's or chain. The pancakes were thick and hearty.

We enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round!

Rarely one to stay out late and certainly not the sort to do so while drinking heavily only to find myself craving greasy food at 3:00am I'd be lying if I suggested the iconic Peppermill had ever interested me as more than a sort of Las Vegas curiosity and yet with a 12-mile run and a few donuts from Ronald's already under my belt it was with a 'what the hell' smile that I entered the neon-lit space with mirrored ceilings just as the cops arrived to deal with an unruly inebriated couple who were refusing to pay their tab.  Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24\/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later.",9,7,6

I loved the multi-colored sugar on the table, the kitschy decor, and even the huge portions, which are typical for diner establishments, but the food just wasn't that good even under the influence of alcohol.

The Peppermill is considered to be a LV institution with extremely kitschy decor (think of fake trees, neon lights and vinyl wrap-around booths). It's right across the street from Circus Circus, giving it somewhat of a creepy vibe at night. This area of the strip just feels dead now. 

My review is based mainly on the food, which was surprisingly lackluster. I expected it to be at least better then IHOP, but it reminded me of Denny's. I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty greasy and my friend's salad was made out of iceberg lettuce with huge piles of fruit that looked unappetizing. My sweet potato fries were okay, but tasted like they were previously frozen.

I would have given it a higher rating, but I expect diners to have good ""junk food.""

I've pretty much had most of the salads, soups and a handful of the sandwiches.  My favorite thing off the lunch\/dinner menu is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  Oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of fresh fruit.  Yum...I just started drooling thinking about it.  The last time we went I got the steak and mushroom salad thinking it would be a mixed green salad with mushrooms and a couple slices of steak.  No sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  Granted it wasn't Meyer's Ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!

Let me not forgot about the most divine part of Peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  Of course I've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 AM but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  Prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  Their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version I've had in Vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  Don't forget about their Bloody Marys which are the size of a vase (Rock star tip:  Order an extra shot to ease the transition back to the daylight).

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in Vegas, Peppermill is not the most innovative but I just have to give Peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good.",2,0,1

I've never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I've been there over the past 15 years. It's amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff's cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that's about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.

I've almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don't know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can't finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I've had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than ""Sugar in the Raw."")

We grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack. 

Beyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound.

The outside makes it look like a classic diner. However once inside you'll see its true appeal. It literally looked like a strip club but was missing the most essential aspect of it, a pole! That could've, would've been nice! 

The front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated. It took a while for our waitress to make her way to us which is understandable given that they were swamped but we had been waiting for 50+ minutes and could've used a refreshment right off the bat.

Our orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.  

Overall, definitely not a bad option if you're in Vegas and want something yummy and fun for breakfast. However, if there's a long wait I wouldn't bother. I personally, didn't think it was worth the 50+ minutes we waited to just get seated. I did think the lounge was a fun place and wouldn't mind stopping by there for a pregame drink.",0,0,0

Ok, maybe the Vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of Tao and a million Wolfgang Puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. But then again, Peppermill is right across the street from Circus Circus and right next to the Riviera, and away from the worst of the Strip traffic.

My girlfriend and I went to Peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in Las Vegas, always a good sign. Once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts. 

We were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. She helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.

My girlfriend got a grasshopper and I tried a Blue Hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. No watering down here, I guess!

For our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while I tried the pastrami burger with (I was delighted to find) curly fries. We finished off with an ""Elegant Brownie,"" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs with just slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.

And the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. Not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.

Like most touristy joints, they had a decent looking blonde walking about taking overpriced pictures.  She was very friendly and made the experience for my friend (out-of-towner) fun.

The sugar jar entertained us.. you can just pour it on the table and have fun.  We drew lots of shapes and took lots of pictures.  None of them are PG enough for Yelp.

The circular pink plush velvet booths, fake chinese lantern flower vines, and blue neon tubing are so cheesy and awesome.  They have tv's at each booth playing music videos from the 70's.

Had the ambrosia french toast. These photos don't do it justice. The plate was huge! Served with sour or whipped cream, both of which were very good. I wasonly able to eat half along with my side of eggs. My bf ordered a standard meal and asked for the bacon extra crispy but it came out almost undercooked...just the way I like it. He had another special request which was taken down but didn't happen but he was in love with their toast so that made it all better.",0,0,0

We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday. 

We had a friend staying at the Wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the Wynn restaurants. None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.

The decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!

I can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.

We had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.

On the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)",2,0,0

We had gotten off the plane in the middle of the night and wanted good eats and drinks with convenient parking before heading to where we were staying. Peppermill seemed to be the type of place I was looking for.  I was delighted to see free parking and their own parking lot and equally as delighted at the ridiculous decor inside! The menu is huge. My boyfriend had an omelet and I had a panini and fries and we were both stuffed. Glancing around it looked as tho all of the portions were just as big. Once we were done eating we ventured into the lounge and had a seat at the bar and eventually seats cleared out at the cozy fire pit which is surrounded by red rounded couches and lots of mirrors. We enjoyed big tropical drinks and people watched.  The Peppermill is the type of place where anything seems to go...exhausted travelers such as ourselves were welcomed during the week but an evening gown and tux would work just as well. IF you want some late night eats after a night out drinking in a really cool environment I would call this a must do.,1,0,0

We Ate there twice so far first time I had the Marco Polo Omelet and YUM is about all that needs to be said. 10 egg omelet was way more than I could eat, but every bit was delicious. My boyfriend and his brother in law had the corn beef has with the braised egg just as it was on the menu. They both said it was alright and could have been cooked just a little more to make it crispy rather than mushy, but again the portions were huge.

 The second visit it was just me and my boyfriend and we got pancakes and biscuits and gravy to share. We should have just stuck with the pancakes, not that the biscuits and gravy was bad they were very good. It was just way to much.

I heard my first mention of this joint on an episode of ""CSI"" and I was interested. I saw my idol Tony Bourdain meander his way here and I was hooked. I took my first glance of the Peppermill's interior and I was obsessed. Am I a coke-fueled old school glam slam Vegas princess? ...Maybe. But I sure do love this place!

The food is generally hit or miss, but believe you me the portions are GIGANTIC. You should either probably split a selection with somebody else in your party or prepare for a ridic amount of leftovers. You have been warned.

My two favorite dishes here are the seafood omelette (Mediterranean I think it's called) and the Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs and all the fixins. Again, we aren't talking Michelin-star quality, but the ingredients are definitely fresh, plentiful, and made to your liking.

But the absolute best part of the Peppermill? C'mon... the entire joint is draped in mirrors, fake foliage, year-round multi-colored Christmas lights, neon trim lighting, and a dark carpeting fit for a fab downtown casino floor. The lounge itself -- which looks deceivingly large thanks in large part to those mirrors -- is a trip, and definitely one of my top ten Vegas landmarks in my heart.

That single fire pit is captivating, sexy, mysterious, and gaudy all at once -- and I promise one glance and a slippery lil drink between your fingers, and you'll fall truly madly deeply in love like I have. Everyone is also very sweet, and although some have mentioned the spotty service, I've experienced nothing but the utmost courtesy and efficiency.

Trust me and the other people who review this place, its way better than going to Denny's, IHOP or any place to get late night food.
Its not hard to find, its right on the strip, not too far from the WYNN\/Encore Hotel. Basically in between Sahara & Spring Mountain streets.

Sexy: Waitresses still don the cute mini dress uniforms and the cocktail waitresses still wear long dresses with the high leg slits. Cozy circular purple velour booths.

The strawberries tasted like they came out of a Beatles song. My main entree of country steak, eggs, and hash, was equally perfect. It's fucking cool inside here, as well.

The decor is something out of Starlight Express with crazy neon across the entire restaurant.  The menu is overwhelming, not because it had too many choices, but because just by the wording on the menu you can tell you are about to be served an IMMENSE amount of food.  I have no doubt that if I had had a heavy night of drinking I would have probably appreciated this place a lot more, even though I found it quite good.  The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, ""Well this is all we got"" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.  I had the Eggs Benedict and he had the Ham and Eggs, note that every item on the menu comes with at LEAST 3 eggs.  Our food did take quite a while, but as I said, it was Sunday Brunch time and the place was packed with a line out the door.  When our food arrived it was hysterical.  My Benedict was enormous, 3 eggs spread across 2 english muffins, and the rest of my plate was covered in a thick delicious layer of hash browns,  Eggs were fluffy and light.  My partner, wow, if I could paint you a picture of how much food was on his plate...  Ok this slice of grilled ham was so large that the plate was literally layered with food instead of spaced across the plate.  The under layer, hashbrowns, above that a huge slice of ham even with the bone, and then the 3 eggs on top.  It was quite entertaining watching him attempt to eat what he could so he didn't feel like he was wasting food.  I will note that our waitress took a drink off our bill for the wait even though we never said a word and we were quite happy to enjoy each others company, so they are certainly not the kind of place that sees being busy as an excuse for not exceeding customer service.

When we called to make reservations for our large group (10+) for lunch on Father's Day the receptionist let us know that even though they Didn't do reservations, you could still call ahead and get put on the waiting list before you arrived.

The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we called ahead about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.

However, this wasn't wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.

What to choose?

After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things:
1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak

The Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of ""A Christmas Story."" All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was ""You're gonna poke your eye out!"" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.

Good sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn't taste the alcohol.

P.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion's cup (Known as a ""Fishbowl"") as a memento for an additional five dollars.

Time to do some eating!

Portions were very large. Great for sharing.

The Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your ""crave"" list. 5\/5

The over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4\/5

The hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2\/5

The ""Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!"" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4\/5 and also their Pancakes 4\/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn't so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.

Kind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.

This is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.

Maybe it was the day and time that I actually came in, but I was really expecting more from this Vegas classic. The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.

The food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.

Bottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it.

Note:  this is a breakfast review (served 24 hours a day) based on 20+ visits.

Come hungry.  1lb flame grilled, bone in ham steak and three eggs and half dinner plate serving of crispy hash browns (or  pile of toast, giant muffin, or entire bagel with cream cheese).  Not enough eggs? add a side of additional three eggs for just $3.95.  Eggs Benedicts with not two but THREE poached eggs atop a split English muffin, a pile of Canadian bacon, buttery hollandaise and those incredible hash browns again.

Giant omelets folded and filled with a wide range of staples from chicken or turkey breast, sausage, or shrimp to artichokes, fresh spinach, peppers and tomatoes all made gooey with  jack, cheddar, provolone, parm, or even feta cheese.  Zero complains.

Greasy spoon French toast made from thick slices of Texas toast quick dipped in a cinnamon, vanilla custardy mixture.  Three eggs, two strips of bacon two link sausages sit alongside.   The carbcakes, errr, pancakes, 14"" giants.  Three golden, fluffy, buttermilk disks that hit the spot.  As a combo, add the two eggs, bacon and sausages.

Go during daylight hours and it will always be crowded.

Tip:  Put your name on the list, and go to the lounge, light up a machine for $20 and play some video poker or keno to pass the time as you enjoy a giant, spicy bloody Mary (lubing the system or hair of the dog).  Don't forget your 10 percent tip for the bartender if you hit.

Very friendly diner service.

Sure, nothing is specially sourced, nothing heirloom or organic, no claims about hormones or non GMO.  Sulfates, nitrates, phosphates abound but so what?  Eggs and bacon always cooked to order (ie over easy, extra crispy).  The great American breakfast, Vegas style lives on.",24,19,21

The Peppermill is a very odd place. From the outside it does not appear to be anything special. Step inside and you will find a coffee shop that looks like a Denny's on acid. There are blues, purples and pinks everywhere. There are mirrored ceilings, tiffany lamps and faux cherry blossom trees.

The waitresses are wearing very short kimono type shirts\/skirts. Making things more bizarre is that there is also a night club in the back that has pools in it that spit out fire on top of the water. Despite all of the craziness, the restaurant is 100% coffee shop in the front.

SERVICE: Everything was right on the money here. There was a delay in bringing my food. Though not a big deal, the manager came over and took a percentage off of the bill without us asking. Everything was very prompt.

FOOD: We ordered breakfast. Their hashbrowns are unique, I have never had ones like it. They were great and I am glad I ordered a plate of them. I could tell that they take great pride in the quality and preparation of all their food. Everything was outstanding. The kids ordered kids plates and loved them. We ate one of their gigantic hot fudge sundaes. The bill was about what you would expect to spend at a Denny's.

RECOMMENDATION: For a great breakfast, you have to go to the Peppermill. It is located center strip and should be easily accessible from any of the Las Vegas hotels. It is truly a unique experience.",2,0,1

So, naturally,  after reading about this place from a Yelper whose reviews I trust, find very humorous, not to mention a girl I absolutely adore from 3,000 miles away, I HAD to come here when I was in Vegas. 

Walking in, you're greeted with the blue and purple neon strip club lights. The music is on all the TV's. Classic Rock, some pop scattered here and there and when I entered GNR was playing on the TV's.  Okay. Peppermill, Ya had me at GNR.

So, breakfast was ordered as I sat staring at a little water pond with a fire place in the middle.  It was a step down kind of pit, and it was so oooooo relaxing I soon almost nodded off.

Went here with one of my buddies after night one of Vegas.  We knew that going to something at the Grand would be expensive and probably not very good, so we asked the door guys for the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  They both agreed the Peppermill was the spot.  It's also close to many places on the strip, a ~5 dollar uber ride or 10 dollar cab ride for us.  

While we were on our way, I was anticipating this quaint little diner, maybe some knick knacks on the walls, etc.  Well, I was mistaken to say the least.  Going in here, everything is neon and mirrors.  That being said, it was 7 in the morning (we were on Florida time still) and the place had plenty of people, so it was a good bet this place was legit.

The menu itself is impressive.  So many different varieties of breakfast food.  I got the French Toast Ambrosia, which is just, enormous.  Whoever can eat this in one sitting is clearly contributing to the national health care crisis.  The french toast was very good, not too heavy.  However, it is laden with whipped cream and about 5 different kinds of fruit, so it will fill you up.  The half a liter of syrup I added to it may have contributed to its density as well.  The fruit is good and fresh.  It's not mind blowing, but this is a LOT of food for a great price and, if you're staying at a hotel or something, you can bring back leftovers and have several breakfasts or share with friends.

If you're in the area, bring your sunglasses and come down here to grab a bite.  It's a great way to escape the hotels and have some good food in a more local-type Vegas atmosphere.",3,2,2

This review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.

THE RESTAURANT

Mirrors, fake Cherry Blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?

Service here is very good, prompt and friendly.  Proportions can be ridiculously large!

On the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and I didn't want to be too full... so I was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  I ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made Yukon Gold Potato chips.  The sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though I could not finish them.  My wife had the chicken pesto sandwich with onion rings, both of which she LOVED.

We returned a couple of days later for breakfast where I had the country fried steak and eggs which was good, though again I could not finish it (and I am a BIG eater) and she has the French Toast Ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  It was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  

I also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  I am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!

This place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  Proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.

THE LOUNGE

We freakin' LOVE this lounge!  Again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  I have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!

The waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  They prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their ""dress code"" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so I am not too what the boundaries of this ""code"" are.  

They have a really cool menu advertising ""retro"" drinks like champagne cocktails, Manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   I ordered a Vodka Gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a Beautiful.  Both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  

Again this place can be pricy.  In fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at Treasures, a very high end strip club.

Money aside, I would find a reason to go to Vegas just to hang out at the Peppermill Fireside Lounge.

The ONLY reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.

Edit:  My wife's preferred drink this weekend was a Pina Colada.  She wanted me to point out that the Peppermill was the ONLY establishment that served her PC in a hurricane glass as it SHOULD be.  It may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details.",0,0,0

Facing a grim flight after nearly a week of avoiding casinolands and focusing instead on the awesome climbing and desert hiking that the area contains, I was hesitant to go into a place that I'd imagined as a kind of cartoon of a Vegas cliche. I relented primarily because it looked a reliable redoubt against the desert heat.

Guess what?

It was a cartoon of a Vegas cliche on steroids and psychedelics and it is truly a worthwhile stop.

With cocktail servers who all look like they stepped from a TV commercial opposite Ricardo Montalban, a surreal decor that verily shouts 1970s pickup scene, and a fountain that shoots flames, the important thing here to note is that they serve cocktails in glasses bigger than my head (and I'm a bit macrocephalous), it has subsequently become my most ritualized stop in Las Vegas.

""If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge.""

Well, I did wanna feel like Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" and just so happened to be dawning my fanciest silver dress, so Peppermill seemed like the place to go.  Umm...maybe that was too much information...

This place is definitely a 70's disco hall converted into restaurant.  With neon pink lights and plenty of mirrors all around, you walk in wondering if you might be seeing some platforms and bell bottoms with the Bee Gees performing on a stage somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were none of those things to be found.  However, what they do have is pretty good food at very generous portions.

Unluckily for me, I was starting to become more and more hung over by the second by this point in the afternoon but I felt it would probably be a good idea to get something in my stomach.  Being 4:00 in the afternoon I decided that breakfast would probably be the best call so I ordered up what ended up being I gigantic plate of eggs, potatoes, sausage, and other vegetables.  I tried in vain to gobble this down but I was definitely feeling nauseous by this point.  Yet, despite my throbbing head and queasy stomach, I still thought that the breakfast was pretty damn good.  

I'll definitely be coming back here my next trip to Vegas.  Hopefully I'll be less hung over next time.",2,1,2

First of all, man! This place gets crowded. If you can, head straight for the counter for immediate seating. Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day\/night you're trying to get your grub on.)

Menu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.

I opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered ""good choice"" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and\/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.

Oh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me.

-Garden Omelet [custom] ($13)
-Lorraine Omelet ($13.20)
Total was $40 with tip.

Portions were very generous, and came with a couple sides. I opted for the hash browns and English muffin. I couldn't finish half my entree and I was hungry! Hash browns had a little burnt taste to it, but no biggie - I stuck to my veggie omelet.

Peppermill is the all-around best restaurant that you can only Yelp dream about at night and still obcess about it during the day.  

I was introduced to Peppermill by my friend Jenny who is very particular about her food.  So, when she said she wanted to go to a 24-hour place that's so much better than Denny's, I mustered the excitement that I usually reserve for eating Del Taco (""I guessssss, if there really is nothing elese....).  Upon arrival, you find that it was probably designed by a strip club interior designer:  Neon lights from ceiling to floor and under the tables, mirrored ceilings, sectioned off booths.  Yep, this is Vegas, baby!  

But, the food, oh the food!  I started with the ""waffle ambrosia"" which is a Paul-Bunyan sized waffle covered with fruit and whip cream.  The waffle has this ultra soft inside, crispy outside, and the cake batter is soooo good...The fruit ambosia is a complete cocktail of freshly cut fruit of strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, grapes, pineapple, and bananas.  And you can tell they just cut it right now...as in 5 seconds ago.  And, if you're not a waffle person, the pancakes are just as good.  

So, what else?  Because no person is full on just waffles (I can barely eat half)....

Bone-in Ham Steak:  Do you love ham?  Do you hate ham?  Who cares?  This ham steak is so thick and juicy that you wonder why anyone bothers to eat that sliced sandwich ham stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too with grill marks.  

Nachos:  BIGGEST NACHOS ever!  Warm chips!  Big chunks of meat!  

Omelets: They use 10 eggs in every omelet and it's so fluffy and yummy... awww....

Ice Cream Sundae for $8:  I have no idea why anyone would want to order this.  Why does anyone order an $8 ice cream sundae?  Now I know.  It's like 3-4 servings of Baskin Robbins sundae...with two bananas and the best strawberry ice cream with real strawberry chunks.  There's chocolate and vanilla ice cream and good nuts and a boat load of whip cream. 

Honestly, every dish is like the perfect dream: the quality is super high, the food is super fresh, the portions are way too big for one person, and you'll eat food in a way that you wonder why there are even other restauants open.  After awhile, you don't know what to order because you crave the waffle ambrosia but you also want some ham-steak.  The last two times we were in Vegas, we had to have it twice a day...No food can really compare.  

And the best part?  A dinner for six with drinks is just a little under $100 with tax and tip.   

And strangely enough, every single waitress is really giddy and sincerely nice.

It's a classic!
The neon lighting to booth style seats in the Fireside area you feel as if you're stepping into a world once been. You would swear you saw Elvis Presley walking through, and not an impersonator.
I've gone to the Peppermill all hours of the day, in all states of intoxication and never once have I been treated poorly. I've always been treated like a rockstar!
The girls on the restaurant side can be a little overwhelmed at times because it's usually slam packed no matter what time of the day you go. I never expect my food to be delivered quickly because it is always slam packed! This doesn't bother me because it allows me the opportunity to go to the Fireside and enjoy a drink. Their prices for drinks versus the portions are absolutely Fair. However, the portions of food you receive are enough to feed a small village in New Guinea. The prices for the portions of food and the flavor of food seem almost cruel because they are so cheap.
If you've never been to the Peppermill, then you've never been to Vegas classic!
Every single kid in my generation has ditched school once and gone to the Peppermill or party all night and gone to the Peppermill for a 6 a.m. breakfast.
Can I think of one bad experience I've ever had at the Peppermill including the food? No, not at all.

If people have bad experiences, I believe their expectations are too high and they don't enjoy the Ambiance for what it's worth.

If you really want to treat yourself, order the French toast.
I would suggest splitting it with somebody if you have a small stomach because it's one of those things where your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

Between the two of us, we had the Marco Pollo omelet (chicken, spinach, lots of garlic and cheese) with potatoes and a blueberry muffin on the side, and the chicken nachos.

What we received was something the size of a small planet: a mountain of multi-colored chips topped with delicious beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, olives sour cream, guacamole. It was fabulous. And our snack was big enough that we didn't need dinner, and had plenty left to snack on all evening.

So we came back the next day, (why wouldn't we?), for a real dinner. We split a quesadilla and a steak and mushroom salad. Again, generously portioned and delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Mushrooms, and blue cheese topped the salad and they were delicious. The quesadilla had a fresh pico on the inside and it was phenomenal.

Omelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.

Sandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.  

For me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.

Prices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.

I have lived in Las Vegas for just over ten years now. Finally I have made it to the Peppermill. Service was a little disappointing, but not so bad to kill this review. My wife and I went on a Friday close to 11:20am. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes until a table was ready; we were invited to wait inside the Fireside Lounge.

My wife and I don't drink but LOVED the atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge. We literally sat fireside, watching the atmosphere, looking over the menu, this is where I discovered that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had dined at The Peppermill. Personally I think that's cool. As if it were on cue, our table was ready in 20-25 minutes.

As we sat, at our booth, Hope you like booth seating. Unless you are at bar we will be seated in a booth! Our server arrived soon after. We were overlooking the menu still as the waitress took our drink orders. When she returned we still needed time to decide. Our waitress said ""I'll be back"" as if our not ordering yet was an inconvenience for her. 

The food was fine. Typical diner like fare. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I ate a  Philly Cheese Steak, Savory u.s.d.a. choice beef strips flash - saut√©ed with strips of onion, bell peppers, sliced tomato and smothered with provolone on a grilled steak roll. My wife ate what was called, Conquest, Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, saut√©ed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough. The meal reminded me a lot of eating at a diner like Denny's. When I mentioned this to my wife she fully agreed. 

As we were eating, a lady with camera walked by and asked if we would like to pose for a souvenir picture. We agreed.The lady with camera said she would return as soon as we were done with out meals. But alas she never returned.
The meal was all but over. My plate was empty; my wife still had a few onion rings on her plate. Our waitress came by and asked how we enjoyed our meals. As we were answering, she took the plates, without asking if my wife wanted those remaining onion rings.

I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would ""treat you like big shots"" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.

Then we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.

Now here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, ""you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated."" We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No ""thank you for dining with us"" or ""have a nice holiday"" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. 

I would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee.",1,0,0

It's more or less a classic diner, but then in the back there is a fire pit built into the table that we sat at which was different and provided for a beautiful ambiance. Sitting at the table and sipping our drinks was very relaxing and there were many people here on dates or catching up with a friend. The waitresses wore long black dresses which seemed elegant, classic and I thought was interesting. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a chocolate chip martini which was delicious, but I expected it to be a bit more flavorful. My friend ordered a frozen Scooby Doo martini which she did not really enjoy. We shared the appetizer sampler which was huge. It came with breaded chicken, fried shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. The food was OK, nothing too crazy. Best items were the mozzarella sticks and the chicken. After about two pieces of food each, we both began to feel very sick and nauseous so we didn't even finish our food.

But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: 

""Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. ""We hate big crowds,"" Keuning says.""You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place."" Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers.""

This is old school Vegas with all it's gaudy lights and style. The fireside pit was definitely a place I feel I can get Day Drunk at. The fireside pit was separated from the main restaurant. If you installed a few poles and threw in some strippers, it will look EXACTLY like a strip club. It's dark and the seats were definitely strip club-esque. 

Anyhow, we ordered this fishbowl drink (supposedly their signature drink) that we saw being served at another table while waiting for our table at the fireside pit. It was about 18 dollars and enough for 2 people to share because it was huge. It was also quite a tasty drink. Thumbs up.

We also split an omelet, which came with a side of hash browns. Both were decent. Nothing particularly good or bad to say here.

From what I could tell, the lounge is to the left, restaurant to the right. Inside the lounge\/bar area, it's dimly lit with couches sprawled around all over, and small fires burning in central areas (usually with couches encircling them). As most of the fire areas were occupied, we found a small section and sat down. The menu had an interesting list of drinks and we each picked out something when the waitress came by to take our order. I chose a weird ""cream cheese icing"" drink just for the hell of it.

Our drinks came out and I was presented with a martini glass rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and this eye-crossingly sweet icing flavoured drink. Seriously, if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, don't get this. I love sweet drinks and it was delicious but it pretty much made me done with drinking afterwards! 

We had a small incident that resulted in my drink on the floor (and on my pants) and the waitress who saw it came over and cleaned it up, while we apologized and asked for a second one to replace it. She brought it over and even though the spill was our fault and we expected to pay for it, she never charged us for it! Hooray! (we did leave an appropriate tip to show our gratitude!)

The bar itself isn't too loud and rowdy (we were there between 11:30 pm and 12:30 am, give or take). TVs scattered around up on ceiling were playing videos of live performances of a range of music, mostly 70s and 80s rock, which was pretty neat to watch.

Sadly, we didn't stay, just long enough for the one drink. As we had just flown in that day, we both had a sudden crash and wanted to just to find our hotel and rest up. We had planned on staying for a few rounds of drinks but unfortunately did cut it short.

The Peppermill is a dinner slash lounge and when I first moved here in my hey days friends and family always suggested The Peppermill as a late night hang out or a cool place to grab food and more drinks after a long night out. They might have been a bit on the drunk side every time they were there though lol. Anyhow fast forward about 10 years later a wife and 2 kids later life was totally different and friends too now have families of their own.

After numerous try's to eat here for breakfast with families from out of town has been unsuccessful I finally got that break. A friend and his wife and kid was visiting and after a night of taking our kids to the Nostalgic Circus Circus we ran out of options places to eat and then  I remember THE PEPPERMILL so there we headed. We get there and the parking lot was quit bare and I am celebrating at this point. 

Walking in we were all excited for this experience and couldn't wait to see what was in store. Like another fellow Yelper said inside of the Peppermill totally gives off a Strip club vibe which was a bit funny because we had our 1 to 3 year olds with us. Note that even though it is a lounge on one side it is a totally kid friendly place with a kids menu at that. We were seat fairly quickly and food came out at a reasonable time. Though it was not that busy. Service was friendly and food came out in big portions. All the food options on the menu sounded super good and they came out pretty good but nothing over-the-top. It is a diner and I'm sure if I was out all night drinking and partying the food portion and flavor would be on point, but I wasn't so I am a little bit more critical. The food sizes were amazing and I can completely appreciate that but the taste was only a couple steps up from your typical Dennys. 

Never the less we had a good time Anderson enjoyed our food. I will totally be back but if there is a wait what so ever I won't be waiting in that line. Next time I'm leave the kids at home and joining the other adults in the lounge so I can finally have my drunken late night experience I never got to have. Stay tune for that review update LOL!",10,4,5

THE ATMOSPHERE:
It feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.

THE DECOR:
Being inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.

I fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. 

THE FOOD:
The coffee, so necessary after any 1\/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.

My friends and I shared:
1) Munch's breakfast, which was saut√©ed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.
2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. 

With your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.

Finally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!

In all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.

Will definitely be adding this to my Vegas rotations.",5,6,4

I kept thinking ""everyone raves about this place. The food better be damned good because their service surely sucked."" Unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered buffalo wing appetizers and they looked like they came straight out of a Sysco bag and into the deep fryer. The taste reminded me of something they may have fed us in grade-school. 
My entr√©e was shrimp scampi; half a dozen or so over-cooked shrimp in some oily sauce. The saving grace was the rice pilaf. Yes, it also looked like it was boiled, or microwaved in a bag, but it was not bad.

I was SO excited to visit Peppermill. It's everything I love: over the top uniforms, kitschy decor, bad music and diner food. We walked in and I was in love. We put our names in, and it was about an hour wait. That's fine, we knew it was popular. We went to the bar and had several Bloody Marys each while we waited. Thankfully our bartender was great and the Marys were alsp excellent, which was the ONLY saving grace in this entire experience. After nearly an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, I went to the podium and asked how long it would be for our party. My exact words were ""I'm sorry, I don't mean to be that person or obnoxious, but could I check on the wait for my table?"" The girls asked my name snd initially couldn't find it, but then I pointed it out at almost the top of the page; it was very easy to see because almost all the other names (a good 20) below mine were scratched out, but mine wasn't. The girls asked me what time I put my name in, I told them right after 1:15. The two hostesses looked at me horrified amd said ""it's almost 3:00!"" I told them yes, I knew, and I was very upset. Then the two girls started arguing ""well, you were putting names in,"" ""but you were the one calling!"" and then turning to me and cooing about the time and telling me it sucked how long we waited. I don't CARE. Fix. The. Problem. 

We were promptly seated at that point, but I asked to speak to a manager. At first, she was very empathetic, but then seemed to lie to my face about what the problem was. I told her what had happened and that I'd wished the girls up front had handled the situation differently (I told her I'd wished they'd just have apologized), and she said she's going to talk to them. Fine. Upon returning, she told me she was the one calling names, remembered calling us, and that she didn't know what happened because the system was messing up. Um, no? For one, the girls told me they were calling the names. Two, my name wasn't scratched off. If you'd even called it, you'd scratch it out if we hadn't come and you cancelled our party. Three, what system? It's handwritten names in a book and a speaker, and we could hear it fine in the bar. Bartender didn't hear our name called, either. So sorry, not buying that bull. She offered us apps but I was over it, I wanted to eat breakfast and leave. 

They expedited our order, and the food was fine. I wasn't expecting spectacular, since I came for the atmosphere. My boyfriend loved his omelette, though. Everyone was nice and all, and the manager comped us and apologized, even going as far as to walk out of the restaurant and wish us a good day. That (along with FINALLY eating) really helped, but still have a bit of a sore spot. We'll see what happens next time in Vegas.",0,0,0

I'm a sucker for reality tv, reading books by celebrities, etc.  Holly Madison mentioned that this was one of her favorite places, and I think one of her reality show episodes had her peeps dining here.  This is also a favorite of the locals, so I visited this place for breakfast with friends a few years ago...the portions were HUGE, and we actually remembered this as being a ""favorite"" of ours.  Las Vegas has numerous restaurants to choose from so if you remember a good one...you'll want to return rather than taking a risk elsewhere.

I was back there this past weekend, and I asked my friend where she wanted to go for dinner...she didn't care.  Since we had a car this time I suggested Ellis Island, or Peppermill.  She's not much of a beer drinker, so I thought she'd like the ambiance in this place better so we stopped in again.  There is lots of parking in the lot here.  This place has a 70's roller disco kind of vibe to it... it's cute, totally not cheezy!  VERY ""Vegas"" I might add.  Of all my facebook check ins while I was out there...this place had the most ""love that place"" comments from my peeps back home.  

Portions are HUGE here...you will not leave hungry.  The staff are great too.  This time we just got a few appetizers and drinks (we both ordered the ""bubble bath"").

The decor is much nicer than one would expect from just looking at the outside of the place, and it was full of patrons once you got into the dining area. Because this is Vegas, in addition to the normal waitstaff (busboy, and waitress) they also have cocktail waitresses who stop by your table to take any alcohol orders you might want to place. We went for breakfast, so it was a bit early for me- but hey, it's Vegas! Plenty of people were drinking at 9:30 in the morning. 

I had the oatmeal, which comes with a lot of toppings, and bacon. My wife had the two egg breakfast with bacon. We were both pleased with our meals, I will certainly plan on eating here again. They offer everything on their menu 24\/7, so you can have breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter time of day you show up. I like that. I like that a lot.

If you're in Vegas and you don't go to Peppermill, shame on you. And your momma. I am THAT serious. I was in the hunt for a brunch type restaurant that serves good bloody marys and Peppermill did not disappoint. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

Ambience: 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the pink and blue neon lights give it a divey, strip club-esque vibe which I totally loved. There's a firepit in the center of the lounge area, complete with comfy seating and overhead TVs. There are several other TVs throughout the lounge. It's quiet, yet not awkward, perfect for the invariable hangover headache. Another plus: they're open 24 hours, so you *really* have no excuse.

Staff: 
The bartender was great, I wish I could remember her name. Very friendly, sincere and prompt. 

Food: 
The Fireside Lounge only offers food from the appetizer menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and a bloody mary (~$7). The bloody mary was definitely tasty, came garnished with a cherry tomato, a cucumber slice and a celery stick. I asked for olives and the bartender obliged. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 large jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce, and what appeared to be shredded cabbage buried beneath the cocktail sauce. While the shrimp tasted great, they were a bit chewy\/tough and may have been frozen a little too long. Also, I don't know that I would pay $13 for shrimp cocktail again.

All in all, the Fireside Lounge was the start to a perfect Vegas morning (if 1:15PM counts as morning when you're hungover).",6,6,5

Some people actually get to eat under the canopies of the fake trees.  All the waitstaff are dressed up in some way.  The cocktail waitresses have these shmexy long gowns, the waitresses have short skirts and suspenders, and the waiters have a male version of the suspenders.  They show less skin, though. Too bad. 

This place is known not only for its Vegas-y vibes, but also for its large portions!  Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long.

definitely unusual d√©cor... I don't really even know how to describe it ... sort of like mid century design... 80's-90's color palette ... steakhouse meets juke joint breakfast diner? 
But I do have to say the atmosphere was great.
As I said, it was busy. We were quoted a wait time of 25 mins and were seated in probably 10. the greeter sat us and Jen (our server) got our drinks. She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. 
The cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! 
I might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. 
So instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! 
My GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side...

It's that awesome fireside lounge. If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.

In the restaurant, the girls are dressed like Hooters girls, in the lounge they're dressed like prom queens in full on gowns. With that said, the lounge is NOT fancy, it's just a cool place to drink and be comfortable.

Yes it is neon and tacky heaven and the waitresses in the diner wear outfits made out of me mammy's old curtains, but it is just so damn good a diner. Good food, huge selection, super friendly staff (except one lady who looked like she wanted to chin me, because she brought me a Dr Pepper when I ordered a Coke) and the Fireside Lounge is the stuff made of legends.
The Fireside Lounge is a dark den, that is lit up by neon trim and pool of bubbling water with fire coming out of the middle. Pure class.
The crowd is eclectic as hell. You will get vaguely normal folk from the strip who have heard of the legend that is the Peppermill mixed in with crazy folk who have been there all night playing the video poker machines and rumour has it the odd lady of the night with that something extra that you really do not want to see!

The Peppermill Restaurant--So, the decor is a little tacky---what isn't tacky about Las Vegas though???  Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.

The food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.

However--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!

I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type.

Lo and behold, this joint had a burger topped with pastrami and cheese, and was sure I had somehow fallen into a hangover dream where my fantasy would soon be shocked back into reality with some shitty meat atop my dry gross burger - BUT it was not.
Win! Win! This sandwhich has made a footprint in my mind and I will have it everytime I visit Vegas...I will fly to Vegas for this sandwich. It was INSANE and I can only try to duplicate it at home.

Front door parking

Bad Highlights:

Fireside Lounge - If you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their Lounge. I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.

Just a general observation for Vegas newbies:
I see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. A $29 ribeye on the strip IS a steal.",2,2,2

There's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s\/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry\/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.

The lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!

The restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.

Solid breakfast joint with a cool atmosphere. When visiting Vegas, my friend and I were told Peppermill was a place we had to go while in town, so we made the trip over from The Strip for breakfast.

The restaurant itself is really different, but in a good way. Interesting lighting and decor. It's very much a diner but with the feel of a lounge. Quintessentially Las Vegas, for sure.

My friend had a french toast dish which was massive. She wan't able to finish it but she loved the food. I ended up only ordering a small plate of scrambled egg whites - I wasn't particularly hungry - and those were good as well.

There aren't many places on the Strip my wife and I like to bring the kids, but The Peppermill is one place my wife and I like to bring the family for lunch that serves up great diner fare and tremendously big portions of classic Vegas ambiance.

(A note here about the Fireside Lounge. It's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. Fire pits and scorpion bowls. Awesome. But keep in mind, adults only.)

The Peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. Vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. And like I mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.

The menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. 

As for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.

The Peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding Vegas kitsch.",2,0,1

First off....know that this place will be packed pretty much anytime from 9am to 11am so if you're going for breakfast be prepared to wait! While you are waiting you can go sit in the lounge and have one of their signature cocktails or appetizers. These might just fill you up so don't indulge too much because you will still want to have the breakfast as well.

I know they serve lunch and dinner, but this is a breakfast only kind of place to me so I am basing my review as such!

- my friend's bachelorette weekend in Vegas; this place was suggested to us by one of the cab drivers 
- because we were told this is a classic, the bride had everyone dress pin-up for our meal here

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- in Old Vegas I believe, so farther down the popular area that people frequent on the strip

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- very old school diner throughout the main area; the lounge\/bar area with the indoor bonfire was legit though and brought upon a different atmosphere

THE MENU:
- traditional club breakfasts
- Peppermill breakfast favorites
- breakfast sides
- Peppermill omelets
- pancakes and waffles
- appetizers
- soups and salads
- sandwiches
- burgers
- steaks
- entrees
- desserts
- beverages, fruits & cereals
- wine

WHAT I ORDERED (I can't speak for everyone because I don't recall):

What a unique-looking place and I am glad I finally got to try it!  I also liked how even though it was quite busy the server didn't try to hurry is to leave - lol.  Note that they are closed the week of Labor Day for remodeling.  I can't wait to see what it'll look like as it looks pretty rad as is.  (I asked the cashier, and she said she had no idea what they have planned and she'll have to walk into work and find out the new look like everyone else...lol).",4,3,3

The portions are huge and although the place is super packed 24\/7, the quality of food is still very good. My eggs (over easy), were cooked perfectly, my chicken fried steak was crispy, warm and had just the right amount of gravy, and my hash browns were golden brown and delicious.

The menu has something for everyone, which is a good thing since it's open 24\/7 and you never know what you'll be craving in the wee hours.  
The first visit, I had an omelet which, upon ordering, I had no idea would be made with 10 whole eggs!  No wonder I couldn't even finish half.  The second visit the other day, I ordered the turkey club with fries and that was also a healthy portion, but I was able to finish most of it in one sitting.  There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.   
Depending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.  We ate lunch here two days ago on Friday, November 11th, at 12:30pm, and waited about 30 minutes.  Mind you, it was a holiday, so considering that, the line wasn't horrible.

Once we were seated it took AT LEAST 10min before our server WENDY came over to our table. How do you walk up to the customers who will be tipping you with sooo much attitude??! She asked what we wanted to drink, water and lemonade. We ordered the food while she was still standing there so we wouldn't have to wait again (which for some reason pissed her off to the point she felt the need to talk down to us). We told her what we wanted to her and she responded with, ""Yea, yea I got it..see I wrote it down. What else?"" Rude!

The lemonade never came out, so the bf waved down the next available sever. Our waitress came over within minutes to say, ""Soo..You ordered lemonade?"" We nod. She said, ""You ordered it from me?"". We nod again, and my bf told her she wrote it down. Instead of apologizing she rolls her eyes, walks away and someone else ended up bringing our drinks.

I ordered the tostada omlet and the bf ordered the hamburger. It didn't take long for the food to get out, buuut I'm not sure why tables seated waay after us got thier food first?? (Maybe I'm being too picky??) 

The food was just okay. Nothing I would ever come back or crave again. The hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and straight mush on the inside. Disgusting. I barely touched them. And OF COURSE she forgot to bring my side of toast.. whatever. I was already pissed off. Bf said his burger wasn't bad, but not worth the price.

We stopped in for an early morning breakfast after a late night in Vegas. We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome. 

Families were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas. 

Their eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by ""super-solid"" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns. 

An honorable mention goes out to the coffee! Smooth, awesome diner coffee.

(Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.

When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.

Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.

That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.

After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both.

Stuck in the cool of the 80s with blue & pink neon,  pepper trees and 80s pop music playing low in the background. 

I promise you're going to have a great time and the food is way more than you expect when you order it!

More than enough on every plate to share, but so many good things to choose that you have to order more than you can eat.

Cocktails served by a glamorous Vegas beauty in a long black evening gown looking like a starlet from a Hollywood red carpet. Who could say no?

If you are staying at the North end of the strip this is the spot to end your night of drinking and gambling. 

If it goes back to value, this spot has value spade!

From the huge breakfast portions, to the breakfast bloody marys, to the waitresses (I swear ours was a stripper at nite!).  The BEST part of this place, the fireside lounge!  Straight out of an '70s porn set\/ night club scene!  I LOVE IT!!!

The food was pretty good, country fried steak & eggs, how can you go wrong?  And how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  The corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  The one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  Another goodie was the Bloody Mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10AM.  FUN!

I was spending a short getaway at Encore next door. This is the land of $20 MGD and $26.99 omlettes, so I was itching for a more lowkey place with some real down and dirty breakfast.

I took an uber , but it was  actually a short 8 minute walk from encore. There is plenty of parking and an unassuming exterior. The inside definitely has an 70's acid dream meets the wizard of oz . On the left there is a small bar that plays 90's MTV and firepits lit in hot pink! I ordered two bloody marys which were very inexpensive and very tasty. 

When you're called you either get a booth or table. You get to basque underneath some pink cherry trees as some bright LCD TV's play calm images of tuscan villas or underwater coral reefs.

The food is exactly what you expect. Nononsense large portioned diner food. Good thing it's not too oily or heavy, but definitely fits that home made .

We went to the fireside lounge and I immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28\/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own ""wedding"" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.

The benny was OK. I actually didn't try it but slave girl said it wasn't bad. 

I asked my steak cooked to medium rare and it actually came out right! My only issue was part of the steak tasted bitter. Don't ask me how, but it did and I had no idea why. The only thing that really pissed me off was, I asked for over easy on eggs and it came out scrambled.

The crab cake was actually forgotten, well, not by the kitchen, but by our waitress. It came with 3 pieces and it was actually very tasty.

The service was shit. We got no water even after we asked for water. Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her over like in a Chinese restaurant.

The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.  It is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.
 You don't need to worry about the time of day because the Peppermill is open 24 hours and serves Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner anytime. This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1\/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.
The Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  A great Las Vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the Peppermill ****",2,1,0

They serve breakfast all day and the portions are truly ridiculous.  The staff here is super friendly and they are always willing to work with you on the menu if you want to be a little bit creative.

On my last visit, I couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch.  I asked the server if I could combine the two and build a lamb gyro omelet.  The end result was a massive 10 egg omelet filled with lamb meat and feta cheese all smothered in  dill tzatziki sauce.  If you like Greek dishes, then give it a try.

My love for Anthony Bourdain's show No Reservations prompted me to check out this place and we had a blast.

The place is tacky in the most awesome way possible...neon lights, mirrors line the walls and fake shrubs everywhere just add to the ambiance. We went on a Thursday, well, early Friday morning and it was the perfect amount of busy. There were 4 of us and we found a place to sit right away. The seating is cool and intimate. The actual fire lounge area is meant more for couples as the couches that circle it only seat 2 people. 

Looking around the joint, it was a good mix of people. There were some couples on dates, the obvious locals, larger groups and everyone was having a chill, good time.

The specialty drinks are as tacky as the decor and again, I say that in the most loving way. The four of us shared a big ass fruity drink called the Scorpion and then ordered 4 separate cocktails. We also ordered the sampler platter that consisted of fried chicken strips, fried mozarella, fried shrimp, onion rings and bruscetta, basically drunk people food :) Our bill was only about $70!

As far as I know it's open 24 hours, it's in the dicey area of the strip but who cares! It's worth the possible mugging  ;) We only hung out in the lounge area, didn't check out the restaurant so I can't comment on that.

It was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. 

Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick.

So around 330 I had woken him and convinced him we should go to breakfast since we had an early flight out that day. 

We were staying at the SLS and asked an employee downstairs of some breakfast options. The hotel had a breakfast but the guy said Peppermill was great so we called an Uber. It was maybe less than a mile away so we ended up walking back. 

Once we got there, we felt sort of old because apparently everyone is just awake at 4am in Vegas - like from the night before. And we are showing up sleepy since we just woke up. Anyway, the place was packed but somehow we got seated very quickly. 

Our waitress was over right away and showed us the drink specials which I could take advantage of but bf couldn't since he had to work that day. So I decided to rub it in and ordered the scorpion which is huge. I think she said six shots are in it. I can't remember for sure because I had six shots of liquor.

Our food even came out quickly which we didn't expect given how crowded they were.

The tacky blue neon lighting and faux foliage made me feel like I was stuck in the 80's. I kept expecting our waitress to bring out a complimentary mountain of ""booga suga"" just to get the feast off to a rockin' start. 

The food here was adequate in quality and price. I got the chicken foccacia sandwich with fruit salad. The sandwich was a heavy meal, due in no small part to the bread, so I opted to ditch the carbs and mow down on the avocado and breast a la carte. The fruit ""salad"" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That's like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain't.

I think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I'm not sure why we didn't.

These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.

I go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge. 

Unfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars.

I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.

I was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.

The omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said ""about 10.""  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.

We didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.

This all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!

I am huge on customer service and yes I understand it was busy, but I am a server as well and whether I'm slammed with tables or just having a shit night, I still make sure to check on my customers and this dud did nothing. We came here thinking it would be good because it's always busy and the menu had classics on it. I ordered the ciabatta pesto burger and it was slop.

The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  

Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.

Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. 

Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  
My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.

Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.

Service was very friendly and on-par.  Definitely a place to consider if you're nearby and want some good breakfast grub.",3,1,1

Certainly not a bad breakfast option, but not worth a long walk from your hotel, either (if you are at Riviera or Circus Circus, though, check it out). Omelets are huge but filled with too much cheap American cheese, hash browns were rather hard and unappetizing. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...

I liked the blue and purple lighting and the 70's-style round booths. Waitresses wore ""Hawaiian truck stop"" floral print dresses and were exceptionally nice and attentive. Much better service than the average 24-hour hotel restaurant.

I was really hungry from a long flight and Peppermill was a short walk north of our hotel. The 70s dinner theme was cute. There was a cocktail waitress taking drink orders at 10am, but the drinks took a really long time. Pretty good drinks, though. The highlight was the sugar shaker, which was full of sprinkles. Not your average sprinkles, either. They went really well with our pancakes. The food was good but not out-of-this-world.

We stopped by Vegas, coming back from a roadtrip from Colorado to California, so you can imagine the exhaustion we all were feeling, hoping that a good meal would revitalize us.

Waitresses and busboys were generally polite, but also kinda ignored us... they were busy, wont hold it against them. Plus they have to wear these awful uniforms.

I ordered an omelet, I forget which one, but I remember it being HUGE and full of scallions. They could have chilled out on the scallions...
My cousin got the biscuits and gravey, and it wasn't anything special. Just two biscuits and a heaping pile of gravy. The portion was too big for such plain flavors.
My mom ordered the eggs benedict and her face of disappointment made me not even want to try it. She said it wasn't bad though, but my mom is usually too nice for her own good.

There were 4 of us plus an infant and the place was packed there's only 5 chairs to sit in and wait so you can imagine how there were people waiting everywhere. We stood against the wall for 55 minutes and I decided to go up to the host and ask how much longer. She told us it would be another 45 minutes. This is not ok. I told her we had already been waiting an hour and she explained she was sorry but there was a table of 20 waiting before us. That's fine however it's better to tell people ahead of time when they check in, that way we can make the decision of whether or not we want to wait. This is the second time this has happened to us. I saw the list she had written down it was one hour wait so I explained it was actually a 2 hour wait and she should inform people to give them a heads up.

Vegas being a cigar friendly city has always been a huge draw for us, and the retro Vegas vibe of the Fireside lounge has been one of our regular haunts. We were very disappointed to learn that cigar smoking, as of recent, is no longer allowed in the Fireside Lounge (only low grade tobacco that you inhale through your lungs in the form of a cigarette is allowed). A friend in our party was informed of this after he had already lit up a fine cigar! Given this change in the smoking policy, I'm not sure we (or those we know) will be making a return to visit.

While its not like the top restaurants at the Aria and the Wynn; you will not be disappointed at the food they have there. If for nothing else, the outfits the waitresses wear do make the experience that more enjoyable.

Obviously designed by someone extraordinarily high on cocaine, The Peppermill is one of the wackiest places I've ever eaten at.  Had breakfast in the ""restaurant section"" during morning rush and regretted it, but overall a pleasant experience  Off-hours visits are a must... and don't go here if you have epilepsy!   

** Details **

Heard great but conflicting things about The Peppermill.  It was described as: ""a great bar"", ""a great breakfast diner"", ""a great lounge"", ""a great coffee shop"", ""a great late-night hang out"", and ""a great nudie bar"".  It was all those things.

I should have taken my friend's advice and visited the Peppermill's lounge in the late evening instead of having breakfast in the restaurant.  As far as breakfast goes, it was good but fairly normal... except for the 60 minute wait.

Their menu is a pretty classic diner menu. Think of a little higher-scaled (but not TOO high) than Denny's, with hamburgers, soup, salad, steak, ice cream for dessert and everything in between.

Now to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from ""Casino"" filmed there with Sharon Stone.

The food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.

The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.

I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.

I had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  I finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the Strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. It was the right time to give The Peppermill a try.

Honestly, everything was just okay.  Certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  I was a little surprised.  We went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.

The waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  They didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  Get in, eat, get out.  Average.

The food was average too.  This was disappointing since I had heard so much about The Peppermill before--almost all very positive.  I don't even remember what I had the first time, and I rarely forget what I order at a place the first time I'm there.  The second time I ordered the Southwestern Beef Kabobs.  They tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  I'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  Again, not bad, but not really great either.  I'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the Las Vegas Strip.

The atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  It's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on The Strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  The website make the place look very cool.  Better on the web than in person.  Once again, not bad but not great either.  Just average, and I'm not sure average can survive on The Strip these days.

Parking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.

I sincerely hope The Peppermill doesn't go the way of the old Sahara and the Riviera.  They could be something great.  (They SHOULD be something great.)  If you're on that part of Las Vegas Blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  But with all the choices within just a few miles, I'd honestly go elsewhere.  There are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  Even though The Peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, I can't give it more than two stars.",3,1,2

I had a couple of their tiki drinks in a cozy booth. Didn't really care for the in-house photographer though. She didn't do anything wrong or pressure me. In fact she never got to our booth. I'm just not a fan of them in general because I feel pressured into buying a picture. Anyway, it's a neat little place. I will probably be back at some point.",0,0,0

We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. 

Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. 

There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.

You start off betting 25 cents on video poker and you stick a dollar in the slot so you can play 4 times.  You always get dealt 15 or 16 which is super boring, what do you do?  Hit and probbaly bust or not hit and probably definitely lose?  Anyway at some point you'll realize that if you bet 50 cents you can win more if you actually win and get up to $3.50.  Then you get cocky and bet a dollar twice and your money is gone.

Anyway I liked the Fireside Lunge.  There is a fountain in there with a real fire coming out of the middle of the water, you can sit around it and watch the TV screens which are plentiful and playing football, basketball (hoops) and some music videos, good ones like 80s and Roy Orbison.  That puts you in a good mood.  The lights are really bright blue and red.  Neon, with reflective surfaces and free nuts.  I had an ""Amstel Light"" for $5.50 which was depressing, lost $2 gambling and left.  But no one bothered me and you could just waste a lot of time in there I think.  The bartender was REALLY NICE and there are all these fancy dressed up waitresses with their ass and titties hangin' out all over the place.  A good first stop.  Across the street you can get a souvenir  or go McDonalds or do ""indoor skydiving"" and for all of these reasons, overall I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant, specifically the fireside lounge.

Not to mention, it's also one of the best deals on the Strip. For $13.50 you get a lot of food. I'm partial to the omelets, which are huge and come with a hefty portion of hash browns and toast\/muffins. My two favorites are the Maserati and the Marco Pollo. 

The hash browns are thicker than any I've ever had. It actually feels like I'm eating pure potatoes--not overly buttered ones.

This place has the classic diner feel, but better food and heartier portions. It's pretty packed, even in the graveyard hours. And every once in awhile you'll catch a famous face sitting at one of the booths.

Nothing says Vegas like being greeted by a row of slot machines upon entering a diner with decor that looks like an indoor park threw up all over a casino. That might not make sense, but anyway, the food is awesome.

My cousin and I had one of those late nights and wanted some grub before heading home. She wanted breakfast food, and I wanted something with meat and fries and maybe some greens to make me feel like I'm eating ""healthy."" Not a problem. Peppermill's menu has a good amount of tasty options.

Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap: I ordered this wrap which comes with the choice of either curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I chose curly fries because I can't remember a time when I went to a restaurant where that was an option. I think wraps can be hit or miss, but this was a hit.  I was really diggin' the combination of the spicy chicken and the mixed greens and house made ranch dressing. The curly fries were crunchy, greasy, and delicious.

The service is decent, though slow. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, but the wait is worth it considering how good the food is and the generous portions you receive. 

Peppermill's location is on the sketchy side of The Strip, but the parking lot is well-lit and there is security that patrols the area.

We found it on Yelp (course) and were seriously surprised. LONG day of flights plus a workout in. We didn't want to get super decked out. Went literally from the fitness center in our hotel to Peppermill after walking down to the strip. We told the cab to take us here and he was cracking up.  We didn't get the joke till we arrived. 

Pretend and visualize you at a IHop\/Denny's with ambiance lightening, dance music that serves alcohol. You have arrived at the Peppermill Lounge. LOL!!!! 

The food ROCKS here. Late that Saturday night we each had a mediterranean omelette with egg whites and hash browns.  Bran muffin for him, blueberry for me.  We barely said a word to each other. We just chowed! I kept eye balling these HUGE onion rings that were passing our table and said I HAD to go back at some point and get my onion rings.  It was a must-do. 

The next day for lunch we needed something sort of easy and quick. It was Sunday and we walked in around 1130 am to see a JAMMED room of people WAITING for tables to get in....I'm telling you, it's THAT good. We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit\/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit\/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.  Next time I'm just getting those onion rings. :)

On our most recent visit on Saturday at around 11 am, we knew it would be busy and were told there was a 45min wait.  In comes the Fireside Lounge where we able to find a seat to pass the time where we ended up easily waiting 25 minutes before being asked for our drink order.  Once our drinks arrived in a timely fashion after ordering, they were exactly what we wanted.  As our wait grew longer, we began to wonder if we were forgotten.  At the hour and a half mark after hearing name after name, we went to check on the status of our table for 3 and upon arriving at the hostess stand we discovered our name had been erroneously scratched off at least 40 minutes prior.  Upon this discovery they promised to seat us right away, which they did.

We ordered a mixture of lunch and breakfast items and as always they were huge portions and delicious.  Once seated for our meal, everything exceeded our expectations.  Disappointed in the hostess service and lack of trying to recover better, but with dozens of great meals we've had at the Peppermill over the past 10 years, this was the first dropped ball we can remember.  

PS Favorite items are Nachos with beef and the Reuben with onion rings and always wash it down with a 64 oz Scorpion drink!",0,0,1

The interior is romantically dark, but with low, florescent lighting spanning throughout. The mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on. The foliage that envelopes the interior adds a lovely exotic touch. The ""tables"" are actually large, low to the ground coffee tables, surrounded by big, squishy couches pushed back against a wall, so everyone gets their own, private grotto. Shall I even begin to talk about the bubbling blue flame pool that you can sit around? Awesome!! 

And let us not forget the drink menu. Typical bars and lounges in Vegas will serve up trendy, funny named drinks where, you have no idea what's in it, but with a name like ""Mouthfuck"", you just HAVE to drink it. Not so at the Fireside. Not only are the cocktails reasonably priced and STRONG, but they're the CLASSIC drinks that you would expect in Vegas. Not only did I recognize all of the drinks on the menu, but there were some drinks that are so classic and vintage that no one my age (25) has ever had them, so they're sort of trendy again. I had my very first Old Fashioned, and then followed that up with my first (of many) Champagne Cocktail. Honestly, Champagne Cocktail is where it's at!!

Then of course is the music. True to old Vegas style, they play Dean, Frank, Sammy, Bing, etc. And then, to appease their younger generation, they play Beyonce, Justin, and whoever else is popular these days. However, the song selection and sound level is hardly offensive; indeed, it's quite mellow and chill, thereby allowing you to suckle upon your champagne cocktail, or other drink of choice, and engage in verbal and social intercourse which might then, if you are lucky, lead to other kinds of intercourse. Really.. this place is friggin awesome.

So I had alot of time to review the extensive menu which covers pretty much the full gamet of what you'd find at a Dennys (Breakfast, Sandwhiches, steaks, fish, burgers, deserts & Full Bar) but more Upscale.

I had also viewed several Youtube videos, one which featured the Mammoth ""SCORPION"" Cocktail ($20) & that pretty much sealed the deal on what I was going to have to drink. The Scorpion came just as it was shown on the vid and was very good wt no hint of any liquor at all which was strange because if you look up the recipe its loaded with alcohol. I am a vodka drinker and I'm guessing it was the 151 in the mix that had me done drinking anything else & sweating bullets towards the end of the visit. It packs a punch.

The Bartender in the Fireside Lounge was very freindly & had a good sense of humor especially when I pretended to have poked my eye out on the long straw that came with the drink and demanded someone call Personal Injury Attorney Glenn Lerner. The Bartender immediatly offered up some scissors to cut the straws to a shorter more manageable length.My accomplice had a glass of White wine ($9.50).

After conversation over our drinks and very hungry, we went into the main dining room and were immediatly seated in a nice out of the way booth in the back that was big enough for a group of 4 so we had pleanty of room to spread out and make ourselves comfortable.

I ordered the 1\/2 order of Nachos wt Chicken ($16) and my Partner in Crime had a salad, Shrimp, and steamed green beans ($20) which looked very good and she had no complaints. The Nachos on the other hand were somewhat of a dissappointment. I have definatly had better. The quantity was overwhelming & in fact wt my huge cocktail, could not finish them. My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.

 The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.

The waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others. Go to youtube and see the various vids there. The breakfast dishes look very good as do the burgers. 3 out of 5.",1,0,0

She always notices little things like that. After the meal, we paid and went next door to check out the firepit. It's in the bar and lounge area.

The entire place is vintage -from the orange upholstered banquettes to the sunken fire pit. Each booth feels private, and since this place is kind of surreal in a back-in-time way, I could imagine that a couple looking to spice things up could start a night of sexiness at this smoky-mirrored mecca. Note - this place is not for those who like new, modern, high-end things. You will not find the Peppermill sexy if you don't like a little grittiness.

Peppermill is located on the strip north of the Wynn. You really can't miss it with the big neon blue and pink sign. I feel like it's just a classic place. I mean my mom used to work there back in her day, its been in movies, and it still packed on the weekend. Peppermill is a unique place. It has been a while since I walked into a bar and was just in awe. I know it's an older place and it could use some updating but fuck it, this place is cool. 
You have two parts, the lounge and the restaurant. My friend made reservation for the lounge for his and my best friends birthday for 20 people or so. We walked in on Saturday around 8pm and got to our table and started to order drinks. I love their drink menu. The have some basic drinks and then some ice cream items and even the scorpion. This night I was the DD so I could only taste a little bit of everything. Everyone got something a little different. Alabama slammer, grasshopper, creamsicle, and mudslide to name a few. Everyone had a blast and their happy hour is awesome. They have 50% off well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers. Also their beer are in a bottle. We found that out when we ordered Irish car bombs. No biggie tho. 
Inside the lounge they have a fire pit surrounded by water. Every time I walked by the seats were all taken and there was a lot of canoodling. The decor reminded us of poison ivy's lair with all the leaves and plants and also a strip club. They also have TVs playing different concerts. It was interesting because music was playing but we could hear each other. We had a large area and a lot of people but we could all hear each other. We didn't have to yell across the table or yell in someones ear. Peppermill was a blast from the past and I want to go back.",33,14,24

I have been to the Peppermill a couple times in the past few months only because I had friends in town. This isn't the type of place to hang out at often because it is pricey. The first time I was there for food, my friends and I were seated at a round half couch table in the back. It was very hard for me to get comfortable because the table is cemented to the ground so there is no way to get extra room. It was a snug fit. Next time I would ask to be sat at a table with chairs. Anyway to eat I ordered the chicken fingers platter, with fries, and my friends ordered a sandwich and french toast. The food came out quickly, they were not busy at all. I enjoyed my food, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The portions were hearty and the price was reasonable.

The next time I had friends come to town, we stopped here to check out the Fireside Lounge and get some drinks. The lounge is inside the Peppermill on the left, and is for the 21+ crowd only. It has plenty of seating, as well as a fire pit with some comfy couches surrounding it. We sat around the pit, and ordered drinks from the happy hour menu. Dirty martini's were only $4.50 each, and we also ordered mozzarella sticks which were like $6 something. The drinks were very good, but the mozz stix sucked. The ranch was BOMB though. This definitely is not the place to make as your local watering hole, but it is cool to stop in once when friends are in town.

One thing to note is there are NO prices on the regular menu at all for drinks. They have a lot of speciality drinks, with different syrups and add-ins, but again NO pricing, so you have to assume they are $$$$. (The pricing is listed on the happy hour menu for food and drinks though.)",10,2,4

The nachos are terrible. The cheese was hard and when I mentioned it to the waitress, she said that's how they always are. Hmm...ok. For $17, I would expect the nachos to be delicious. 

Most of the time when I come here I get the philly cheesesteak.($12.95) It's exactly what you want when you order food from a place like this, yummy and greasy. lol! It's messy and that is how I like them. A few times I ordered breakfast and it seems like my friends always order breakfast too. It's pretty good, nothing special.

The New York steak and eggs was ordered at medium rare, but It came out medium. Juicy and tender enough, with pepper sprinkled on top. It comes with a choice of bread, where you can choose muffin or toast. The blueberry muffin was very moist, soft and delicious with some sugar on top.

The turkey dinner (seasonal) was actually very good. It wasn't dry at all. Came with a side of stuffing, cranberry jam, mash potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and some veggies.

We also ordered the Soup salad and bread. The chicken soup tasted fresh but the salad wasn't very fresh, some of the leafs were already starting to brown. You are given the choice of Garlic bread or Rosemary. We went with the garlic bread, and I was happy to see that it had cheese on it.

The Ciabatta pesto burger, was ordered medium but came out well done. Had it been cooked correctly it would have tasted pretty good. Ordered with a side of Onion rings which were on point!

With this visit only lasting under 24 hours, my wife and I wanted to make the most efficient use of our time, so we made sure the dinner was early enough for us to enjoy while leaving us enough room to return the next morning for breakfast. This time (Tuesday morning) we sat at the counter after being seated at a booth. We didn't have a problem with where we were seated but wanted to enjoy a slightly different experience. What made this restaurant stand out, beyond just having quality food, is the fact that the manager made it a concern of hers to make sure there was nothing wrong with where we were seated. That act alone shows that everyone, including management, is interested in making sure the customer is receiving good customer service from the time they walk through the door.

For years I've driven by this place thinking that it looks like a Vegas rendition of a Denny's. When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant. 
You instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it. 
The service was on spot and great!! Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you're in the Vegas area. Great for pre\/post parties or even being the main attraction.

You are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.

Well, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the Peppermill, except that I was not on a Charlie Sheen style bender. Even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, I was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.

After a long day of traveling and working, I came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that Snookie would salivate over. With my entree, I was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. I opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. And when I say side, I mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.

It was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. But of course, being a nasty pig, I devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a I could until I felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose. 

I was so impressed by the meal and the service, I let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that I would be back the following day. As I wasn't pulling a Charlie Sheen, the next day I kept my word and returned with my coworker. Word is bond, yo.

This time around, I had a chicken focaccia sandwich filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of Balsamic vinaigrette. The sandwich was delicious. This time around I opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. Whatever. I like being fat. No, really. I swear.

I went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the Rock in Rio festival. One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.

The ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.

Our female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.

A different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. 

- Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce 
- Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual
- Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalape√±os, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. 
-  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?

We were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.

Needles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.",10,2,4

As soon as we sat down a regular (I assume) told the bartender he would buy my mom and I drinks. I ordered a martini and the bartender asked everything from what type of vodka I wanted to shaken or stirred to what garnish I preferred. Stoli, shaken, olives. And I got 3 olives at that. We played video poker at the bar while 90s and 2000s music videos played on a TV at the center of the bar. It was relatively quiet on a Tuesday night but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The bar only serves appetizers so we ordered the sliders and 10 hot wings. Again our bartender asked us a series of questions about which condiments we wanted with our food. The sliders were standard, but with surprisingly cold patties for how slow it seemed in the restaurant. The chicken wings were better and the sauce was perfectly spicy.

I cant count how many times I've come stumbling in here whether its been sun up, sun down, middle of the night, etc. The San Francisco special and the crab cake benedict are my favorite.

before entering the lounge you must remember the dress code: no hats. other than that your good to go. it was dark but the neon lights and black lights brought a relaxing mood to this place. it was me and 3 other guys. bad idea. this place is for COUPLES! if your not there with a significant other, you'll feel a little awkward. the plush couches were made for snuggling. we felt really uncomfortable and so we headed straight to the bar. i saw those huge goblets and i told the waitress i wanted whatever drink goes inside those. the cocktail was the scorpion. i had it before at trader vic's. its a very good fruity\/girly cocktail. i really couldn't taste\/feel the alcohol....yet. its 18 dollars for the cocktail but it can easily be shared by 3-4 people. some guy next to us won 7000 dollar jackpot in video poker, and i'm not too sure the management was too happy with that. overall, this place is a really chill, relaxed place to hang out after a long hard night of gambling, drinking, clubbing\/dancing. but make sure you come with a significant other or else get ready to feel lonely and awkward. 






SECRET....order the scorpion blended with ice cream. it will freakin rock your world. o and be careful please cuz you won't be tasting any alcohol in it.....it'll taste like a fruit milkshake. :)",4,2,3

In perusing Tripadvisor while sitting in the Firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon Peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  Oh my, what a trip.

We drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.

Tacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk\/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple ""what happens in Vegas stays..."" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)

When our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. 

Peppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  It's on our list for a return visit.",2,1,1

Unfortunately, due to the unprofessional and extremely rude attitude of the manager on duty at the time, Peggy, I have to give this establishment 1 star.

While in the restroom, a male employee opened the door and said ""Lady, I have to clean""  and added something along the lines of telling me to hurry up. 

I went up to the host podium and politely asked to speak with a manager. Peggy said that she was the manager, so I told her that I appreciate the fact that they keep their restroom cleans for their guests. However, having a male employee open the door and ask you to hurry up is unsettling and was an unpleasant experience. 

Peggy then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't have said that to me because, ""he doesn't even speak English"". I responded by stating he knew enough to stay that. I can excuse the way he said that, knowing that there was in fact a language barrier. That's fine, I am not saying anything poor in regards to his work ethic. It's hard to work somewhere where the predominant language is not your own. 

However, to be told he didn't say that to me, is condescending, unprofessional and rude. A manager should never speak that way to a guest and they definitely should not end the conversation, which was civil (I wasn't yelling or making a scene, I was simply telling her it was an off putting encounter), by then walking away without another word. 

It wasn't busy. At that time, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. If I was the owner, this woman would never be representing their establishment. Such an unfortunate situation because everything else from the food to the decor was lovely.",0,0,0

The chicken focaccia is a pretty big hit, with pesto sauce, it's always a good time.  The chicken was so tender and I shouldn't be shocked, but it was tasty.  

The word is, the chocolate milk shake look enticing, but hardly worth the calories since it taste worse than Hershey's chocolate.

My friend had gone previously and told us that it was a yummy place to go with huge portions. I wasn't sure what to order at first but, then I decided on a caprese sandwich with french fries. I also ordered a pineapple and strawberry mimosa; now that was the shiiiiiz. The sandwich was packed with pesto, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The bread was a nice toasty, crusty ciabatta full of flavor; nice and chewy too. I also tried some of my friend's buffalo wings! That was so delicious. The chicken wings and drumsticks were super meaty and not like those tiny ones you might get at other places. The ranch was good and didn't taste like it came straight out the bottle. I definitely need to go back to try the rest of the menu. I thought the decor was cute and kitschy.  Bright neon lights with cute trees inside the restaurant.

What's one to do for dinner?  Then I remembered as a kid, I went to Peppermill with my family during those late nights of working late, class or otherwise. I decided to take him and the spawn here. 

We were greeted by a hostess in a rainbow patterned shirt. She was seating other guests so the cashier came up and sat us immediately. As we sat down, a man in an orange Polo (so many different uniforms) brought us water and asked for our drink order. I settled on an orange juice and the babe just had his water. We had Kaitlyn as our waitress. She was really kind, asked about our baby, and took our order. 

WHAT WE HAD: 
Crab cakes
Buiscits and gravy

The crab cakes came in orders of three, topped with diced tomatoes and green onions. They came with a roasted tomato sauce. Both of us loved it!
The biscuits and gravy were good as well. Wish they came out a little hotter, and personally I've had better elsewhere in the valley. My daughter loved them though. 

HIGHLIGHTS 
Retro decor
Rainbow sugar (they had red white and blue for the holidays)
There were different uniforms for the hostess, cashier, manager, bussboy, waitress and lounge service. Try to spot them all!

Even though I'm a native of Seattle and have only been to Vegas 4 times, I've made it a point to stop at the Peppermill for late night grub and insanely strong drinks in the Fireside Lounge every single time I've visited since my 21st birthday (oh so many moon ago).

On my last trip to Vegas this past December I got to introduce a whole posse of Vegas virgins to the neon splendor and faux cherry tree glory that is the Peppermill.  

Vegas is not cheap anymore, Vegas is very hip now and gone are many of the old cheezy Vegas landmarks that us out-of-towners tend to associate with this fair city, except the Peppermill.  This place is the platonic ideal of Vegas and I hope it stays.

To echo some other reviews: insane portions to soak up alchohol? Check. Pretty hostesses? Check.  Unpretentious atomosphere? Check.  Strong drinks in a great setting? Check.

I walked in and was seated at the counter (per my request). Although the spot was not cleaned, I assumed it would be soon. The waitress came, after a longer than average wait upon arriving, took my drink order, and left to give me time to decide what I wanted. Five or so minutes later, she returned to take my order. I saw her again once my food was ready and she looked at the spot in front of me with a look like ""where should I put this (as no one came to clean the counter). So I said ""well I guess I'll sit over here since no one is going to clean this"" and sat in the empty space to my right. She looked at me with the 'deer in the headlights' look and said ""oh, uh, sorry"". She set my food down and I didn't see her again until she breezed by to drop off my check. She had time to chit-chat to another patron (an obvious regular) but not to see if I needed anything (like a drink refill). Just as I am ready to leave to pay, she then notices my empty glass and asks if I need a refill.
The food was mediocre but no where near what it used to be, and the fries were barely luke warm.

Now for the interesting. A couple next to us came in soon after we did & immediately the guy began badgering his girlfriend from an argument\/disagreement they had earlier n the evening. Now arguing is 1 thing but this fool made the woman cry, she ran into the bathroom, he chased her in there and the continued to argue and berate her back at the table.
So to the pretty lol blonde with the person of unknown color boyfriend with the Trump misogynist complex, I am truly sorry I didn't speak up and stop his foolishness earlier, I try and stay out of people's affairs but your crying, the berating and disrespect had become enough.

One star for unique atmosphere. 

After an hour, I approached the hostess about how much longer & she said ""We're just waiting for tables to get up"" & no apology, which pissed me off.

I will then proceed with a review for the restaurant.  I will then sum up my LOVE for Peppermill with a review for their ""banquet"" services - because, yes, when you get married in Vegas... you MUST have your reception at the Peppermill.  That's the only way to roll in this town.

Lounge:  seedy, swanky, and fabulous!  The service is fantastic.  I love that these are the most dressed up cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  Long sleek black gowns.  Nice touch.  The drinks are fabulous.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  At 2 am.  They are delicious, potent, and worth the money.  I love the flaming fire pit adorned with tvs.  I love the electric glow of purple and pink.  The fake foliage?  Very nice.  The chairs are comfortable (even though I have a small fear of what might be on them in the darkest corners, I take some relief in the glowing purple lights overhead... about as close to black light as we're gonna get).  Looking for a nice place to hang out with your buddies after a late night?  Or a place to get the party started at 10 pm?  Peppermill lounge is the perfect spot.  I would say the parking is super easy.  The lot behind the building is huge.  But if you're going to drink... you won't need to worry about parking.  Take a cab.  They're located at the north end of The Strip, on the immediate north side of Ross Dress For Less.  Now go.  Drink.  And Be Merry.

Restaurant:  bring an appetite.  And a tupperware container or three.  The food is fun.  There is a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The portions are MASSIVE.  You can eat until chorizo is popping out of your ears and then you'll look down and still see half of your plate full of food.  Good thing there are fridges in the rooms at the hotel!  The blueberry muffins are warm, moist, and delicious.  Don't waste your time on boring ol' toast.  Oh, you wanted the banana nut bread?  Yeah - you're going to receive and entire LOAF of banana nut bread.  Prepare to share.  My friend ordered the fruit plate with marshmallow dipping sauce.  They brought her a fruit cart (exaggerating, people... but go with it).  In all seriousness - she probably ate her 5 servings of fruit and still took home THREE containers of fruit for later.  And a 2\/3 of a a banana bread.  If you're looking for a good deal in Vegas - eat here.  You'll easily get two meals out of one.  And when you're hung over and hankering for a little something when you roll in the door at 5 am - why not nosh on a little banana bread?

Banquet services:  Hubs and I had a morning wedding.  Celebrated with champagne and cupcakes immediately after (see my review for The Cupcakery in Henderson, NV).  Then we took all of our guests to lunch at The Peppermill.  We made arrangements with JoAnn a few weeks prior... selected a set menu, picked out colors and table decorations, got a map of the restaurant to make a seating arrangement... and all we had to do was show up.  It was such a blast!  We had about 1\/3 of the restaurant blocked off just for us.  Cocktail waitresses took orders, waitresses took food orders, and we were good to go.  We are proud to say that our friends had never had a bacon cheeseburger at a wedding reception until they came out ours!  Chicken foccacia?  Yup.  Fruit platter.  All us.  The atmosphere was so much fun.  The tables looked fantastic.  The service was excellent.  And it was so neat to see our names on the little display board when we first arrived.  I'm not a traditional sit-down boring reception type person... so the Peppermill fit my and my husbands personality perfectly.  I think everyone had a good time and I'm forever grateful to JoAnn and the crew at The Peppermill for helping to make my special day that much more special... and unique!  

If you're looking for something ""Vegasy"" to do while in Vegas, plan a trip to the Peppermill.  AND you can say you saw the table that Vince Vaughn sat at in Swingers.  How can you say not to that???",4,2,2

Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, ""Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!"" I seriously must have been easily amused and\/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...

I can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, ""Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?"" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, ""Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?"" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place. 

This is your basic diner\/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24\/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good. 

Dress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!",21,29,25

Lemon blueberry muffins, Chicken fried steak or any dessert

Cheesy. Check. A little tacky. Check. Absolutely wonderful. I think so.  I made the lounge my first stop after arriving in Vegas at 2am. I was surrounded by fake plastic trees and hot pink rope lights. I sat where I could overlook the fire pit and was served by a waitress in an evening gown. She and I bonded over making fun of the guy I was with as he asked a billion questions about martinis and I, the chick, just ordered a beer. The alcohol prices, I would soon learn, are pretty much on par with most places in Vegas. They did however have pretty good booze specials that started at either 3 or 4 am ( I cant remember exactly) and ran for a couple hours. I also opted to feast on some nachos.  One order was more than enough for 2 people. Oh, and I know this may not be important to all but I was very impressed that the nachos were clearly layered. By this I mean Chips then cheese then chips then cheese etc.  Not just cheese on the very top of the chips. What can I say? Little things impress the hell out of me.

We were not disappointed.  The place will not leave you hungry...and the prices won't leave you broke!

I had the Philly Cheese Steak...I fully expected it to come with the thinly shaved variety of ""meat"" that adorns most Phillys...but was surprised to find big, meaty hunks of honest-to-god STEAK on this sammy...

Cooked with Peppers and Onions, and not just completely drowning in Provolone...this was actually one of the best Philly Cheese steak sandwiches I've ever had.

It may not have been even remotely authentic, but DAMN was it good.

The Onion Rings were righteous too.  A little on the greasy side...but who cares?  3 days of eating like a 5 year old were in store for us...

What's a greasy onion ring gonna do to me?

It's really a tasty, cheesy treat, that makes you want to start quoting Swingers lines.

She'll escort you to a plush booth where you'll take a seat and she'll let you know your server and cocktail waitress will arrive shortly.

I ordered the Yogurt Parfait and WOW it could have probably served 5 people. It reminded me a lot of McDonald's parfait but with much much better quality fruits and granola. Other notable dishes: Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap (the curly fries with it is AMAZING), Joe's San Francisco Special, and Tostada Omelet. 

The service was not bad! For the most part, everything was what you would expect from a diner so I'm perfectly pleased. Definitely will be back to check out their Fireside Lounge though!!",7,4,5

I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars.

(For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.)

My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.

Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.

My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.

The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem.",3,2,2

There are also several tvs ,in case you dont find the array of characters (fellow patrons)entertaining. Their cocktail menu (extensive-frozen drinks,etc)& bar food menu is pretty good,  something for everyone, as well as virgin cocktails too..

This review is for the Fireside Lounge only.

The bar was surprisingly busy, filled with a loud bachelorette party, couples lost in each other's eyes, and....a prostitute?  Definitely an interesting crowd.  It's more of a date spot, so if you are looking to meet people (other than prostitutes) you may want to think twice before coming here.

The bartender looked irritated and wasn't friendly and I don't understand the long gowns they make the poor cocktail waitresses wear.  Drinks are a little overpriced considering this really isn't a part of the Strip where tourists hang out.  A beer and a vodka cranberry cost $13.

I have to mention that the floor was FILTHY.  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in about two weeks.  Bleh.

The Fireside Lounge is a place that is trying to cling to its '70's heyday and I like it.  Vegas needs more old-school.  Now if only they can clean the floor and liven up the bartenders then I could see myself stopping by more often.",4,4,2

This place was super D - LISH!!! also, fetured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations... 

Let's start with the wait.. .oh hell yeah there's a wait about 1.5 - 2 hours, yes it was that packed and we didn't get to actually eat until about 1:00 pm or so. 

We decided to take our group of 10 and sit in the Fireside lounge...This gem is so hidden that we didn't even know until about 30 minutes of waiting outside.

Lets start with the FIreside Lounge - Think Super fabulous 70's, neon Lights, water \/ fire pit, ultra comfy seperate seating areas, did I mention the Scorpian( also featured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations) yeah that ones a rough one- its super huge!!!  My friends and I all started talking on why we haven't yet partied here and enjoyed getting drunk at the lounge... really why haven't we? Next time my friends next time...

So we get called to sit down to eat, the ambiance is like the old 70's\/ early 80's charm again but with faux trees and neaon lights and faux plants through out... charming.

We get an amazing server, Jennifer, well we are told the portions are huge, in hearing that and then actually seeing the items delivered to the table - thank God we listened and we shared plates!!!

Breakfast menu is really off the chain here! we all took bites off each others plates to sample the menu.. so not disappointing at all eveything was great!  Chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, Joes grill breakfast thing, biscuits and gravy it was all scrumptious.

After inhaling most of my food we were all pretty much full and decided to walk up the strip to get back to normal after the food coma we just endeared.

After getting our drinks and ordering my daughter's food, I witnessed a cockroach crawl across the table.

The waitress came over as I was standing up to leave, in shock, and I explained that a cockroach came over... my friend brushed it off the table... and I stomped on it.  I pointed to its carcass on the floor.  I was still putting my coat on when a manager came by and asked me to please stay.

She said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.  

I was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.

I tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.

It was a Sunday night and kind of quiet which was fine by us.  The neon, the decor, the fire.  So wonderfully cheesy.  I loved it.  

They have a few small flat screen TVs affixed above the fire pit and they play music videos and live concerts which can provide some laughs, depending on your taste in music.

What I didn't foresee was a Hilton, on the strip, with NO bar and NO restaurant. No problem, the Peppermill is just down the street. 

My coworker and I drive there to find a mostly empty parking lot, which made us think the place may be low on the popularity scale. However, in Vegas a lot if people walk the strip and inside, the place was full. 

I ordered the chicken and red pepper pasta. This dish was recommended by two employees.   I found this dish to be very run-of-the-mill.  

The cream cheese stuffed chicken was not outstanding. The cream cheese adversely affected the consistency and ""bite"" of the chicken while I found the red pepper cream sauce to be rather one-dimensional.

what i had:
- country fried steak + eggs w\/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy
- bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!

for two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.

pros:
- food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order
- service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy
- location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food

cons:
- decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!)
- part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place

anyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots of dark purple stuff), would i go back again? YES! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?",0,1,0

Just a little background...This was our 1st trip to Vegas and we visited the Peppermill based on a suggestion from my husband's co-worker. 

When we first walked in, the cheap decor and tacky waitresses caught my eye. There were a few of slot machines (of course) crammed in a small corner, neon lights, cheap plastic plants, and waitresses wearing orthopedic shoes. Because the Restaurant sells drinks, they have a ""cocktail waitress"" who was dressed as if she were going to the prom (on a budget). 

We were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes, it was Saturday around noon, so it was to be expected. The service here was not good. The waitress was unattentive and forgetful, however the food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I ordered to Lorraine Omelet and my hubby ordered some sort of scrambler. The food was seasoned to perfection and the portion sizes were ridiculous. I literally ate on my food for 2 days and wound up throwing it away. I ordered a pancake on the side and it was literally the size of a 20' rim.

I had heard that the Peppermill was worth a try.  We decided to take a gamble and a short Lyft ride down the strip.  To best describe this restaurant in a single sentence, I would say it is a double-priced Denny's with slot machines. 

We walk in and ask for a table.  There is a 25 minute wait for a table but decide to be sat immediately at the counter in front of the waitress station\/kitchen.   Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks never went empty.

We came here for breakfast and their menu had plenty of options.  I couldn't decide on what to get so I asked the waitress what they were known for\/what was popular.  She didn't have an exact idea but said people like to get the country fried steak.  I said hey why not and ordered it.  My wife ordered the blueberry pancakes with sausage and bacon.  The food arrived surprisingly fast.  My food looked and tasted average.  The country fried steak looked like a big battered pancake covered in sausage gravy.  It was just too much for me grease-wise.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen I could see all the other customer's food waiting to be delivered and instantly regretted not going with a lunch option.  My sunny side eggs were alright.  My hash browns appeared fresh cut but were soggy.   I tried a bite of my wife's blueberry pancakes and they tasted great.  Fresh blueberries and such.  For her sides, she ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and her meal also came with a side of bacon and sausage.  

Overall, the food was pretty average.  The prices were kind of ridiculous.  My cup of coffee was $4.  My country fried steak meal was about $20.  My wife's meal the same price.  Overall, we ended up spending over $50 for meal that might normally run in the $20s range at a similar diner.  I could have eaten at Hash House for cheaper.  Oh well I learned my lesson.

When growing up in the late 70's, it was one of our go to spots for large portions of good comfort food, and busty, statuesque cocktail waitresses in flowing gowns.  Man, I remember the colored sugar in bottles on all the tables too...

There are no more Peppermills in the Bay Area, but this one still survives and is a throwback to that seventies diner.  Yes it's ghetto and cheesy, but think of Denny's, Carrow's, or Norm's but with big booth seating, neon lighting, and chrome accents and that's pretty much the way it was.  The colored sugar is gone, but the portion sizes are still decent.  I don't think I would come here to order steak or pasta, but standard diner fare is fine...

That said we had:

The soup and salad comes with the Rosemary bread but only offered a tossed green or spinach salad, so for a little more, I added the soup of the day to my burger and gave it to my daughter so that she could have her soup and salad with a Chicken Caesar instead...

The food is nothing spectacular, but the service was even and attentive, no problems throughout...

I once talked to the concierge at the Bellagio for dining recommendations, 'where do the locals go?'  I asked.  I think he oversold this place because he told me then that this was where all the strippers and showgirls went.  HAH!  Maybe that's why I always see hairy truck driver types in wife beaters hanging out.  Then again, it got me interested in coming here to give it a try.  Open 24 hours, I would come back for diner food, or dessert, or breakfast -- even though I've never seen any stripper or showgirl quality patrons, or even any leggy cocktail waitresses for that matter...",6,5,3

He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices...

It wasn't the finest of dining, but it was good food and the service was decent.

My Blue Hawaiian tasted like Kool Aid and the cocktail waitress even warned me that it wasn't going to be a strong drink. WTF. This wasn't a necessarily cheap cocktail for a coffee shop type of place, I expected a bit more than what I got. I didn't finish it. 

I didn't have one, but the desserts looked great.",0,0,1

This place is a Las Vegas icon.  Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.  

To be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.  

My drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:

-Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.

-Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!

-Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.

-Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!

-Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.

-Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!

I know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.  Nothing that really blew me away.  I would go back because of the status of this historic icon.",3,2,2

We ordered a steak omelette (not on the menu, but you can ask for one) and a steak with fettuccine Alfredo. The cocktail waitress comes separately than the server and our drinks were stiff and fairly priced (for Vegas). A girl taking photos also comes around, and it's the basic drill. You get one photo for free (a souvenir style with your photo placed amongst a collage of the Peppermill) and then you can purchase additional full size photos. As for our food, I truly enjoyed my steak. I asked for medium rare, and it was tasty, but could have used a bit less cooking - I enjoyed it though. Fettuccine was awesome.

I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. 

I have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.

After dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.

It was bad however  I have had better. I had a burger and it was cooked perfect;y. Most reviews say you need to have breakfast which I didn't. The portions are a lot and it was not expensive. Service wasn't the greatest however I was by myself so maybe there was no need to constantly check.,1,1,1

We love Fireside Lounge while we wait on our table and play video poker sometimes. Plates are huge, split if you are a couple! Breakfast is the real deal, go early or the line is out the door! Saturdays and Sundays are only for the ones with time to waste as the wait can be an hour. Once seated they move it along pretty good. We tell everyone about the place and even take new folks if we can to spread the word.",0,0,0

Every time I find myself in Vegas, I end up drinking myself into oblivion and eating like crap.  So after a few days, when my body is pissed off and my liver is overworked and ready to pack up and call it quits, I know it's time for some serious foodage to restore my partying abilities.  Time to go to Peppermill!

Yeah, one plate of food here could probably feed an entire army of ravenous adolescent boys.  Still, I can never seem to agree on a dish to split with my friends, so I always end up ordering something for myself, only to eat and eat and eat for like 45 minutes to maybe get through 1\/4 of the food before I wave my white flag of surrender and admit that I have once again been dominated by the Peppermill.  No joke, the omelets are bigger than my head, and they should probably give you a shovel to eat the side of hash browns with.  However, quality has not been sacrificed for quantity.  The food tastes amazing, no matter if you go for lunch at noon or for a drunken munchie run at 4 AM.

I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm taking off one because I don't particularly like the part of the strip that it's located in.  Sorry Peppermill, otherwise, you're perfecto!!!",2,3,2

The food here is amazing it is the best for you can find in all lost Vegas the specially after a long night out and about and partying and drinking and having fun this is the place that we went to right after New Years Eve it was packed but it didn't matter great service they even include people coming by to provide pictures to provide more alcohol for those of you that are hungover and also provide other amenities that you don't normally find any other restaurant the onion is great the decorations are like from the 70's and 80's altra altra 80 ish I guess you could say um and go in the Fireside Lounge because you'll never believe how amazing it is and check out the shack carpet,1,0,0

The lounge had enough people to take up the chairs around the 1 fire pit they had but besides that, pretty much no one. The food if I may quote another yelper is like overpriced Denny's food. The service sucked in both the restaurant  and lounge. So in the restaurant they have the food runner ask your drink order but if you order alcohol then the waitress has to take that order. I guess the food runner's not allowed to serve alcohol or she just wasn't old enough to serve alcohol I'm assuming. Anyhow, that was kind of annoying. Not too mention the waitress took forever to actually come over to take that order, then forgot a drink. The lounge sucked too. Kind of dirty as in the couches you sit on and the floor. We went in and sat ourselves and waited and waited but no one asked if we wanted drinks. So I went to the bar and ordered our drinks which were kind of pricey and didn't have much alcohol in them. As I pull out my lil wad of money I could see the cocktail waitress standing to the left of the bar eyeballing and giving me a dirty look. Probably cause I went to the bar myself but hey, if you snooze you loose chick. Should have taken our order when we walked in. I gave em 2 stars cause it wasn't horrible and since it does serve food 24 hours a day. I just didn't feel it was worth my money or time. I really not sure why they have 4 stars on yelp. Maybe their breakfast is good I guess.  I more then likely won't be coming back unless I can't get any late night food somewhere else Vegas. Then maybe I'd think about it.",0,0,0
