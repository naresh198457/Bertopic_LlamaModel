I started with the meat - good girl. I had perfect pink prime rib, pork ribs and some thick cut bacon. Mr. Cow meet Mr. Pig.
I hit the antipastos and there were 4 cheeses, and the olives and crisps were nice.
The crab\/shrimp in some egg - was that supposed to be a souffle? eh - don't waste your stomach space, I should have had quiche instead. Smoked trout - which I like more than salmon and tons of large cocktail shrimp.
The ceviche was good - but I tread lightly, tasting only one, because of my first walk up the ramp - which I'll explain later.
I tried most of the desserts - now meet Miss Piggy Cheryl D. I wanted creme brulee but there was none at the time - There were cookies and various pretty plastic boxes and cups and demitasses layered and filled with gelees, raspeberry, chocolate, pear, cake goodness. There were a couple mousse - meese? - I don't know, I was high off food. I chomped on cookies and bread pudding with creme anglaise and a side of ice cream - Peach cobbler was nasty.
It was good for the most part. We went there upon arriving and check-in was at 3 so it was nice having the bell desk take the bags and enjoying ourselves in the meantime. We sat in the back, carpeted area that faces the hallway. For some reason I the ramp area leading to our seats from the buffet smelled like airplane that day. Which is not pleasant for me - I get airsick. I don't know why - the carpet had the telltale steamed V-tracks - ventilation?... Had I known this I'd have waited longer to sit in the very pretty garden court type area so I wouldn't think of gagging on the pretty and delicious food I was trying.",1,0,0

We stayed at The Tower Suites Thanksgiving week and we were excited for the Grand Opening of the renovation. We got to cut in line because we were staying in the suites, a perk apparently. 

My main gripe is the performance of the hostess. I saw no noticeable difference between the old buffet and the new buffet. The seating area seemed the same. We were seated in a tiny little room that appeared to be a meeting room of sorts. It was full with what appeared to be the same family occupying the entire area with the exception of one booth that sat 4. Babies were running around, the family was completely disregarding the dirty diapers their horrible kids were wearing. They obviously were in need of showers themselves. They were speaking way too loud in their own language and I felt like I was in a God-forsaken 3rd world country. 

The hostesses REFUSED to switch our seat.  I was polite as I didn't want to embarrass anyone. I tried to tactfully explain the situation without offending the people we were next to. That moron caught me on a good day because I suffered through it. We asked twice and 2 different ladies denied us twice. The ""manager"" stated there wasnt anything available which couldn't be further from the truth.  I saw plenty of empty tables.   I was astonished that we paid that much for a meal and were blatantly disrespected.  The 2nd reason I wanted to move was because my date relies on a cane to walk. He used a cane to walk into the buffet so the first host had to have noticed it then. It was leaning against the table! The booth was such a tight fit, it was nearly impossible for him to stand while using the cane to shimmy out of the nook she sat us in. There is the wall, a pillar and a curtain in the way. 

There's a good chance I wont be back. If I am, they can bring Mr. Steve Wynn out for all I care, I refuse to take attitude and smelly diapers on vacation.  I have given up on parents controlling their kids and making them mind. I do however expect restaurants to enforce common courtesy. 

The Wynn let me down BIG TIME. #bummer 

When we went to Wicked Spoon the previous day, we had a wonderful experience. The 2 of us were sat at a table specifically made for 2 people and it was right by the buffet. 

We celebrated our 5th anniversary at The Encore and our 10th at The Wynn. I cant tell you how many times in between those 2 significant dates that we chose Wynn\/Encore for our stay. Guess where I'm not headed back to......",1,1,0

We didn't have to wait which was nice and unusual for this buffet. Service was solid but truth be told...they didn't have a lot to choose from.

I heard good things about this place before and it is highly rated on most Vegas buffet blogs, but I tried to keep my expectations down especially when I saw the line to enter. I felt like I was waiting in line at Disney and it took us about an hour to be seated, but they have TVs advertising things you can't miss in the hotel. I also downloaded Wynn's app which I kept myself busy with for most of the time planning out my night and making reservations.

Once we were seated we headed straight for the buffet line. I realized towards the front of the line that we weren't waiting for seats, rather it looks like they slowly let people in so that the lines for food never get too long. I prefer the way they do that because when I finally got in it only took me a couple of minutes to get the food I wanted.

They had so many options. I stuck with mainly seafood and my husband headed straight to the meats and sweets. We ended up spending about 2 hours there and left perfectly filled without being too full to enjoy the rest of our day. The small lines encouraged you to grab only what you needed knowing it would just take you a minute to get more if you needed it rather then piling up your plate and leaving with a stomach ache.

Other bits and pieces I got were the lamb t-bone, shrimp cocktail, salad shooters (thai, mediterranean, caprese).

12\/25\/16 Sunday:
My party of three entered the line at 4:18 p.m. Still waiting at 7:35 p.m. yet a few feet away from the cash registers and another 30+ minutes until we'd get seated, we stormed out.

TIME WASTED: 3.25 HOURS

Before entering the line, we asked and were told it was going to be a 2 hour wait. In reality, it was 3+ hour wait (2 hrs in the outside line, 1 hr in the inside line, they later told customers). While we waited, staff handed out small water bottles, which people littered all over the ground and railings. (How come nobody cleaned up this stuff? Thought the Wynn was classy, not trashy.) The Wynn's slow and spotty WiFi made the wait worse. Complained to the manager Rhonda (sp?) about the 3+ hr wait and she only apologized and told us that it was a 15 minute wait from where we stood a few feet from the registers. COMPLETE UNDERESTIMATION. There was a giant crowd of people from our regular wait line \/AND\/ the express line, standing by the cash registers still waiting to be seated. No end in sight.

We had a show to catch at 8:30 p.m. at Planet Hollywood. So we left without eating. Not surprising as a group from a couple families behind us did the same, as well.

I've always known this buffet to be the most friendly buffet for my vegetarian ways, but today it was elevated to a new level. I asked my server about a particular item on the buffet and before I knew it I was being guided on a personal vegetarian tour of the buffet by a chef.  He walked the entire buffet with me going over every item that was veg or vegan. The item I asked about (vegan bolognese) is no longer served, but that was no problem- they would make it for me!

The taco bar would also make tofu or garden burger tacos on request. Want rigatoni without meatballs?  No problem. Want a vegan pizza? Done. Don't forget about vegan ravioli.  Of course this is all in addition to the clearly marked vegan soup they always have. 

If you are veg in Vegas and want a buffet you really can't go wrong here. The thing that is most impressive here is when I ask ""does this have meat in it?"" The answer is always confident.  If the person behind the line does not know, they will find out for you.",0,0,0

+ Fresh, delicious king grab legs!!
+ Tons of shrimp

The weekend price is a dollar more, breakfast ($20.99) or lunch ($25.99)

They offer a variety of cuisines that range from Asian, American, Italian, Indian, and Latino, had a few made-to-order sections, and also a salad bar. My picks were more of the American-Italian and seafood options, such as the meatloaf, pasta, mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail and baked salmon. The meatloaf was cooked just the way I like it, it had a soft texture, and seasoned well. Pasta was creamy and delicious, and the seafood was fresh. I also added corn and broccolini to balance out my meal, which were both cooked nicely, since I am not fond of tough, under-cooked vegetables.

Onto the desserts, my favorites were the raspberry cheesecake, chocolate lava (highly recommend) , and these edible cones topped with icing and a gummy candy. I also chose lychee ice cream and cookies and cream. They weren't overly sweet, both were on the light side.

I was able to leave satisfied. It is a pricy buffet, but you get exactly what you paid for in terms of quality and ambiance.

The salads were great and they even had a Ramen and street taco section with dedicated people to cook them upon request.  Selection is so-so but the quality is much better.  Rib eye steak was awesome. The only negative I have to say is the lack of fresh fruits.  There was only a melon\/cantaloupe mix and nothing else.  Perhaps it's the time of the year (first weekend of Feb), but if there was room for improvement, it would be that.  Line wasn't that bad either.

The quality of the food varied. The positives included the crab legs, swordfish, and veal shank (although I was very careful to pick the best looking pieces from the chafing dishes). The negatives were the dry prime rib (yes, very sad for the old Vegas buffet tradition), the drier salmon en croute, the soggy fried chicken, and the soggier Italian corn cake. Too bad there wasn't some way to just have my favorites and nothing else.

The drinks were really good. The blueberry comso and the white sangria were high-end concoctions, but little light on the pour. The waiter was nice to let us know which beverages were included and not. Obviously, these alcoholic drinks aren't covered in the pre-paid base fee. The waited also clears the plates, but doesn't replace silverware.

They've done a nice job with the dessert buffet. It's a far cry from squares of Jello like at cafeteria buffets. The selection is large and most of it is above average. It was also nice that the desserts were cut into small portions so more could be tried.

Although expensive for Vegas standards ($32 on Monday dinner when I was there and $32 for brunch), it's not compared to brunch buffets at Ritz-Carlton Hotels which are double in price. Sure, the Ritz-Carlton's are better, but not twice as good. Everything is relative.",0,1,0

Tried multiple items:
Lobster bisque- good
Fried Chicken tasty
Prime Rib- all over cooked (horrible gray)to the point there was no flavor
Quail- same as the prime rib little to no flavor and overcooked
Duck-overcooked
Needless to say I tried multiple meat dishes and had them discarded because the dishes were bland and overcooked. 
When we notified the staff, the wait staff was very cordial and sent over a manager. The experience with the manager was probably the least ingenuine display of empathy in her eyes even though the words coming out of her mouth made it sound like she cared. Either way you get a sense that your feedback is going in one ear out the other.
Overall this buffet does not really have anything that really sets it apart from say the Caesar or M resort buffet other than the beautiful ambience.

Even though the buffet offers long line of attractive dishes, some of them are not cooked well nor have the great taste like other high-end restaurants would offer in that price range.

There's a nice salad bar, several different soups, antipasto selections, various buns and bread, pastas as well as a custom pasta station where the chefs make your pasta right in front of you. At the meat carving station, I believe each day they have different options. The day I went, it was turkey and prime rib. The prime rib was AMAZING. It was so tender, and done medium rare, just the way I like it. I had to go back for seconds, it was that good. 

There's a few selections of Indian cuisine as well as Chinese, sushi, and a chilled seafood section (of course, Alaskan king crab legs).

The desserts are in an entirely different section, where it's like its own separate shop full o' sweet things.Gelato, cakes, baked goods, fresh fruit, and a crepe station.

The rating is a little low because while the selection was great, the tastes of the food wasn't as great. The custom tom yum soup was super salty, the veal shortribs were a tad dry, and the stir fried Asian vegetables were absolutely soaked in oil and probably had more than its fair share of MSG. The desserts didn't get any better either: the red velvet cupcakes were dry, most of the cakes were way too sweet, and there was something off about the crepes. It could've been the chocolate sauce, or the strong taste of Pam that the chef used to make the crepe.

Despite some of the lackluster food, I did enjoy the butternut squash risotto, the orecchiette with creamy pesto sauce, and of course, the prime rib (I'll be dreaming about it for months). The baked chocolate brownie was yummy despite the nuts, and the gelato was delicious.

$40 for dinner is a pretty standard Vegas buffet price, and with the Wynn, the ingredients they use are not as common (or cheap) as what other hotel buffets offer, so it's a good deal. I just wasn't completely blown away by the food.",0,0,1

I'm not sure what I ate here that was special. Your lychee ice cream was good, but shouldn't be the only star of the meal. 

5 of us girls came here for brunch and I was not amazed. The steak was okay, and sort of salty. The mac and cheese was also okay, but nothing wow. I did like their asian selection - shaumai, shrimp dumpling, porridge with black egg and pork sung - yum. 

Something else I enjoyed was their green tea chia seed dessert puree. It was coconuty and had a very refreshing chill and flavor. Another star of the desserts section! 

I did have some of their stir fried veggies and green beans as well and those were fresh. 

Other than that no honorable mentions. The lobster quiche was horrendous - it tasted like rotten egg with itty bits of lobster. The sushi section looked like below average sushi buffet - so I didn't even bother. Fried clam meat? Hardly any clam in the batter - all flour. 

They had this raw tuna sitting in coconut liquid in the sushi section - not sure what that was supposed to be. The japanesey salad in that section was also disappointing.

There were dishes which were barely edible e.g. the chicken pot stickers. One bite and I gagged! horrible, how could they serve this? Hardly any selection for salads. The ""live"" taco making session, had missing ingredients. e.g. they had 2 taco selections there for vegetarians, one needed vegetables sand other beans and guess what they didn't have both of it.

Folks with food restrictions beware, there was hardly any choice for vegetarian. If you are restricted on meat beware again, every other item had pork in it. There were very few chicken dishes. Saw a lot of seafood selection but tried only one fish dish which was passable.

The lunch prices for Monday-Friday were $21.95 and dinner prices on Friday were $37.95. We went at 3 o'clock and there was no line. Dinner starts at 3:30pm and we saw quite a few other people come in right before that cutoff time as well. As soon as we were seated they took our drink orders. They didn't have any freshly squeezed orange juice and so we got the kind from concentrate.  We hit the buffets when it was still the lunch items and there was a good selection. I had a couple of slices of lamb roast, some California rolls, smoked salmon, baked seabass, clam chowder and a slice of thin crust margherita pizza to wet my palette, haha. At that point there was virtually no line for any item. 

When they brought out the dinner items, the lines started to form. So the lines were maybe 5-6 people each time I went to get the rack of lamb and Alaskan king crab legs. At some points I glanced and saw no lines.  On the line for the rack of lamb, you tell them how many pieces you want. Some people asked for 2-3 pieces, other people asked for half a rack and then some guys asked for a full rack. The lamb was pretty good, nice and pink in the center. The Alaskan King crab legs were very plentiful and they are kind enough to cut the king crab legs down the center lengthwise for you, so it is easier to pick out the meat and dip it into the butter. 

I used some restraint to save room for dessert. I first went to the ice cream \/ gelato counter. The flavors they had were vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pineapple, lemon yogurt, coconut and some others. I got a scoop of pineapple and vanilla both of which were very good. I saw them torching some cr√®me brulee and got some of that. I cracked my cr√®me brulee with my spoon and found that it was very shallow. It was a little too sweet for me. They had several different slices of cakes, strawberry shortcake in a shot glass (which was too sweet), homemade bread, cookies, and crepes made to order. I opted to get some more ice cream and had a scoop of lemon yogurt and another of pineapple, again very tasty. We were there for about 2 hours.

I've been to quite a few buffets in Vegas as I like to see what each offers. Sunday brunch was $35.99 with the added option for drinks for $19. The decor inside is just lovely. Flower and fruit pillars fill the main entryway and the whole place has a very Parisian theme going on. It's really nice! 

The food was just ok. There was nothing that made me say, ""Wow that was amazing."" Everything was either ok or just mediocre. The mac and cheese was good and I liked the turkey, mostly because it wasn't dry. Just feel for the price it is not worth coming here again. 

The service was great though! Our server Elvia was nice and attentive. Would bring refills before we asked or would double check with us if we wanted more before she brought it out. Our table was always cleared right away of our used plates which was great. 

Overall, nice experience and decor but food was just lacking.",1,0,0

There wasn't a crazy long line like other buffets, but when looking at the price, I can understand why. You had to add an extra 7 or 8 bucks for unlimited bloody mary or champagne. Usually at other buffets, it's included already. 

The interior looked classy; liked you walked into some wealthy family's sunday garden brunch at their summer mansion.

The food was a level below from Bellagio's, my top pick. Not as many selections. I had a good combination of breakfast food to lunch\/dinner items. Nothing really stood out for me.

. Seafood, scallops is the signature dish here, while poke is pretty pitiful (tuna not so fresh even)
. Meat, variety is pretty good, lamb chops are pretty big and well marinated and roasted (which Caesar and Bellagio doesn't do as a good job)
. The Chinese specialty dishes are the best I've had in a buffet, really good cooking and ingredients, most impressed with ox tail fried rice (and I usually don't eat Chinese at buffets because they usually suck)
. Desert, pitiful, the chocolate fountain was a appetizing sight but you can't eat it can you? There are a few gold pieces on some of the items that arose some interests, overall pretty dole.

But, while the floral arrangements and pretty finishings typical of The Wynn are a nice touch, they shouldn't be fooling anyone. 

The Wynn Buffet is mainly about quantity. With 10-15 different food stations, running the gamut from Chinese congee to US comfort food, it definitely delivers on the core promise of any buffet. More importantly, though, The Wynn has managed to up the ante quality-wise, even if many of the individual dishes fail to perform when taken in isolation. The prime rib was good, as was maple-battered fried chicken, and the bakery is a sweet tooth's dream\/diabetic's nightmare. We waited just over an hour for the Saturday brunch buffet. While fairly long, this seems to be pretty standard for Vegas buffets (and for popular brunch spots), and if you're particularly impatient you can pay an extra $15 to skip the line. 

On the downside, many of the individual items on offer aren't particularly tasty, and are basically an example of ""quantity over quality."" Spend your appetite wisely, and avoid average offerings like wood-fire pizza and the pancake & omelet stations. We also found the speed of service overly slow at times, as plates and utensils mounted up on the table before being cleared.",1,1,2

We were super hungry, so are expectations were low. The Wynn's lunch buffet was pretty much the same price as the Mandalay Bay one, and that one looked like a Sizzler. The eating room was extremely nice looking, and the staff was quick and friendly. There was a ton of different food to choose from. Those are the pluses.

The minuses: Well, the food wasn't that great. The sushi was terrible. The pasta was mediocre. The meats were mostly good, but not great. There were a lot of interesting ceviches to try, that was a plus. Basically, there were 75 different dishes I sampled small bites of, and only two or three warranted another taste. One of those was the pizza, which was surprisingly good, but not exactly what I came for. The other was as Asian inspired dish (though most of the Asian stuff was bland) with green beans and really yummy bits of steak.

I just missed breakfast, and wasn't there for the dinner I've read about, so maybe I just hit it at a bad time.

Sadly we only had two mimosas each because we were so busy eating, if I were to do it again I'd make sure I was getting my drink on at a faster pace!

The whole food area was well organized and lines were non-existent, though the line to get in took about half an hour to get through. The decor of the place was also quite amusing, I felt like we were stepping into ""Alice in Wonderland""

The best part of this buffet was probably the desert  area. OMG I walked by for an initial scan, mouth open and watering, and then realized there was another side with just as much tasty goodness to ingest. The gelato was a really nice addition, I'd never seen that at a buffet before!

(This review is for Dinner only)

 I went a few times in the year or so after they opened, and was very impressed. They had rack of lamb, and better desserts.   The lamb chops were the highlight. They were seasoned very well, and were above average quality. They since removed them. last 2 times I was there, for dinner.  The last visit was about 3 months ago.

The last 2 visits were a huge disappointment..  The bread was stale, the meat was dry, and tough. Inedible for my party.. in fact one in my party couldn't find ANYTHING she could eat.  Everything was bad.  

The only thing I liked was the ice cream. It was hand scooped if I remember right.  All the baked goods were stale, and the cakes\/pies were low quality. The creme brulee was watered down.   The candy apple was HARD as a ROCK!! I couldn't bite into it. I bet someone will break a tooth with that thing.  Did I mention the breads were STALE??

The quality of the food they were offering was worth about $18. Not the $~46 they were charging.  We complained to management, and they didn't want to hear it. They were rude.  Refills were slow. 

We complained to hotel management, and wrote a letter.  About 6 weeks later all we get is a form letter saying they will talk to the buffet managers about it.  

We will try the buffet at the Encore, if they have one,  because in Vegas, the plan seems to be to start off high end, and get lots of hype.. then cut costs big time.  The Wynn cut costs big time alright, and we notice!

Especially at a high end casino like the Wynn.  And everyone that knows me knows that I love to eat! And I love to eat weird foods at that!  But this is definitely the worst buffet I have ever had anywhere.  If I had to choose between this and a dollar-a-scoop Chinese restaurant, I would choose dollar-a-scoop.
It wasn't the fact that we had to wait an hour to be seated,  no matter what buffet you go to or what time of day you go, you will always experience a long line in any buffet in the Vegas Strip.  It wasn't the price of the buffet ($32\/per adult for brunch).  And it wasn't the service. It was everything else. 
First, when we were paying for our meal prior to eating, we were told that children over 9 has to pay full price. We were shocked at this because most kids that are between 9-11 can't eat that much.  Every other buffets we went to, would have charged them kid prices.  Next, there is a total of 13 people in our party.  They prepared us a table that should be big enough for only 8-10 people, so were crammed together, making the experience worse.  And last was the food selection.  None of the dishes looked appetizing.  They didn't have crab legs, their dishes were mainly cheap Chinese food dishes, and nasty looking Italian dishes. Their scrambled eggs looked like it was fake eggs mixed in with some raw real eggs. Bacon was overcooked. Seafood was almost extinct there.

There's a good diverse selection of quality food here, ranging from Asian to Mexican, Italian, American Fare, etc. including sushi, seafood, pizza, pasta, beef, poultry, soups, salads, etc. - - and deserts too!

I always recommend asking the front area if I could look at the food before I commit to going in to see the selection, so if you're every wary of if they have something you and everyone in your party can enjoy and question the quality of the food, take a look first.

What's good about Buffets is it's so time efficient to get seated, served and you pay the bill in advance so it's easy to come in and get out.

It's also the perfect place for parties, esp. if folks are going dutch or splitting bills evenly.  If you have a bachelor\/bachelorette party in Vegas on a budget it's a nice place to converge and everyone pays the same amount and can eat whatever they want as as much as they want, so it accommodates most if not all people.

Also for those at business \/ work conventions, a helpful hint is that this is a nice place, 'tho not dressed to impress and sort of casual, it's actually the perfect place for business meetings since it's fast and has a conversation friendly environment.  Plus, if anyone needs to cut out early, it's that easy to cater to large groups.

The service is good in that it's self service with staff to clear plates, get drinks and at the food stations to help with the food.

The pricing is okay when you consider most entrees w\/ drink in Vegas at any casual sit down for lunch would run you $15-20+, so you can really fill up here for lunch and hold you off 'til dinner or even be ""Linner"" (Lunch and Dinner) as one big meal.   For Dinner however, it's a bit pricey for some, but they do add in Snow Crab Legs and Roast Beef (not as good as tender prime rib medium rare 'tho, more like that ""Barron of Beef"" that tends to be tighter and over cooked) to their dinner menu.

Did someone say Buffet?! Well, I only wish I came @ 3ish since that's when they supposedly serve crab legs, but I did spend a good 2 hours @ The Buffet with the girls!

So they have a a whole selection of diverse dishes..from soups to pastas to a personalized omelet station. I like to walk around the buffet first to evaluate each and every station. Italian dishes.. check..Asian cuisines..check..Mexican food...check..American..
check..desserts..check. 

I would say that it was worth the cost to get in for good quality and unlimited food. I'm always down for anything seafood. So I gorged on the variety of fishes...from calamari to sashimi to sushi to well prepared baked salmon and halibut dishes. These were just some of what I tried and I almost died and went to heaven...hehe..well..let's just say I built up a good enough appetite for all the yumminess to come!

This buffet is probably one of my favorites in Vegas (Cravings @ The Mirage is awesome too!) and also because I just lovedlovedloved  the interior decor. It had a whimisical feel to it with a good amount of my favorite pastel colors throughout and OMG..LIME GREEN!!! I was in LOVE! Flowers were accentuated throughout the buffet with perfect lighting from the outside. Gosh..I miss it already!

Our group of 9 gals didn't have to wait in line for too long and were seated at a large round table with the bachelorette at the head. Kinda felt like we were in a castle and she was our queen..hehe

Although we didn't have our prince charmings at the time, we still felt loved by the awesomeness of good company and delectable, mouth watering dishes. Definitely a place to go to again..next time I'm making sure I get my CRAB LEGS!!!

Desserts!!!! There were a vast variety of mini desserts. I really only enjoyed the ice cream the pecan pie. Everything else was mediocre.

Pizza, We only wanted one slice from that big pizza so it seemed kinda a waste so we took 2 each. I was walking around and found few more people that were vegan so I didnt feel too bad after that.  My first vegan pizza was just alright. It had so much veggies on it so i had to take all the bell peppers off. Also vegan cheese for the first time... it was very different and ... slimy =\/ but it was good. My Vegan friend didnt like the cheese or the pizza. it was just alright.

The next personalized food was the soup. They gave us tomato soup. I thought it was just okay too... bland and my friend doesnt even like tomato soup! HAHAHA.

The Wynn has a vegan\/vegetarian menu for every single restaurant on the premises, so it's ideal for someone like me who opts for the plant-based options when possible.

The buffet at the Wynn has become a staple of my Vegas diet because it's so good and easy. It's usually more expensive than if I ate elsewhere (since you're effectively subsidizing the meat lovers), but I love the endless variety. It's also much faster than most Vegas restaurants unless you happen to be there on Sunday for brunch (and if you are, the $16 VIP upgrade to skip the regular line is totally worth it). 

I've eaten at nearly every major buffet in Vegas, and this is definitely one of the best.  Caesar's is probably the only one I'd put on the same level, and it doesn't come close if you include atmosphere in the score. Food is consistently fresh and well-prepared even at odd times of the day, and service is friendly and fast.

Everything we ate was just ok. Some of it was totally disgusting! The prime rib was so good 1 year ago that it has stood out in my mind ever since. But, today it was just like the prime rib you can get anywhere else. Average.

The Wynn had a pretty diverse selection of foods: they had Indian, Middle Eastern,  Asian, and a selection of fancy cheeses and antipasto, just to list some. I think my favorite foods had to have come from the desserts section (but I am a desserts girl). I love that they had handscooped sorbet and ice cream! But my most favorite dessert had to be the little tiramisu that came in a little espresso cup! My only beef was that the fruit tasted a little too raw, but there isn't too much you can do about that.",2,3,2

The restaurant is grand and very beautiful. The food are displayed delicately and even for lunch there is a wide range of vareity! All of the food was very delicious!

Usually in buffets, by the time I get to dessert, I am already super full. By for Wynn, I always save some room in my stomach for their dessert! I like their idea of putting dessert into small slices, into small cups, or into small plastic shot glasses. You get to try out so many different types of dessert because of the size! They even have freshly scooped ice cream for you!

My absolute favorite is the dessert with the mini plastic coffee cups in colors of green and orange. For some reason I forgot what the name of the dessert was at the moment, but every time I went there I always get two cups of that dessert!",0,0,0

We had a large party of 16 and luckily we went early so we didn't have to wait in a long line. They sat us in a side room with no other customers which was really nice.

We went on a Sunday night. The dinner buffet has an assortment of salads, bread and prosciutto, various pizzas, fish, a carving station, made to order street tacos, a ramen bar, dim sum, sushi, crab and assorted seafood. With so many choices, I could not try everything! I did really enjoy their prime rib. I was pleasantly surprised that the meat was so flavorful and tender. All my coworkers also really enjoyed everything they ate. 

Like most buffets in Vegas, there is a huge dessert selection. Gelato, cupcakes, candied apples, a crepe station etc. Be sure to save room! A few of our coworkers got the bottomless drinks and enjoyed beer and sangria! I decided to stick with just enjoying the food. I'm so glad that the buffet at the Wynn is good again!

I actually thought this place was okay & a bit pricey, but then I went to Rio world buffet and then I realized, Wynn buffet is sooo worth the money! 

We went to Wynn Buffet right after we got off the plane around 6ish and there wasn't a line at all! I was so surprised,I was expecting to wait at least an hour. I love how everything is set up, looks so classy! 

Anyways, I ate a lot of food there but what I remember the most is the :

Chicken Caesar Salad, it was sooo good! I went back for seconds
Mashed potatoes, really creamy but not too much
Crab Legs, sooo meaty and fresh, dipped with lemon- delicous
Unlimited mimosa for 7 dollars, absolutely great! I've never had mimosa before and the Wynn made it a great first experience. 

I also had a strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream crepe for dessert but the crepe was so thin! I heard that's how a crepe is suppose to be, but it's just too thin in my opinion.

Located at the fancy shmancy Wynn, we've heard great things about this buffet being the freshest, the best, in Las Vegas and we were beyond excited to try it out. 

The unpleasant surprise we received when arriving at The Buffet drowned our mood the entire time. And that surprise was that men cannot wear sleeveless tops. Since its the Wynn, I suppose the owner wanted a more fancy and elegant type dining to match the Wynn's reputation, but let's be real, its a buffet in Vegas. And its hot during peak tourist time (spring\/summer\/fall), so men are bound to wear sleeveless tops. Anyways, we thought it was a dumb rule for a buffet, but we opted in buying a $12 tshirt for my boyfriend since he had a Jersey on and our hotel was too far of a walk to grab a shirt, and we really wanted to try out the buffet. The tshirt was a plain gray shirt with the logo Wynn on it. We thought it was a tad bit sexist since lots of ladies, including myself, were wearing revealing dresses, short shorts, crop tops revealing their bellies, etc. Sucks to be men in Vegas, I guess.

The foods were definitely fresh. The layout of the buffet was clean, elegant, and even though the mirrors made me lost at times when I was wandering, I enjoyed the atmosphere. I decided to spend the extra $13 (I think) on bottomless mimosas. The server refilled my mimosas almost every 5 minutes which I am grateful for. 

However, since its a buffet, the foods do stay out for quite awhile, especially unpopular items. I had the salami\/prosciutto which tasted like it's been sitting out for hours. The spicy salmon roll were okay, Bellagio $20 buffet definitely tasted better in that aspect. The variety of the foods were quite disappointing, I didn't get that much items on my plate. They had rice porridge Chinese style, but thats dirt cheap to make. I expected better foods to be out. Plain veggies in containers to make it look fancy. The dessert section was okay, I liked how they had gelato. However Wicked Spoon's dessert trumped that in the dessert section. The fish were fresh, but I wasn't fond of the flavors\/sauces it came with. One fish dish had cranberry on it. 

Overall, we had high hopes and were disappointed in the end. It's worth a try, just make sure to dress appropriate. It was $33 for a Sunday lunch without bottomless mimosas.

I need to make one last comment: THERE ARE NO CRAB LEGS. You would at least expect the ""Wynn"" buffet to have crab legs, especially paying for a costly fee. No oysters. Just cold shrimps. My heart dropped. Should've gone back to Bellagio's for $20.",5,0,0

Vegas is hell of expensive.  Parking fees everywhere now.  So we parked at Circus Circus for free and just walked over to Wynn.

It's unfortunate an establishment such as the Wynn's would employ incompetent hostesses particularly Jessica, and Jennifer to greet their guests.

If it's your policy not to allow reservations for large parties, then at least be organized about the seating process.
We were told it would be about 20 minutes to be seated (this is AFTER waiting in line for 1 hour and paying), however 1 additional hour passes by and NO ONE  had the courtesy of giving our party any updated information. There was an ""oh well"" we don't know when we'll be able to seat you attitude by the hostess, when we had to ask about being seated. We offered to be split up in 2 tables, however this was never communicated to the front hostesses. It should be not be so difficult to find tables to seat your guests so they can eat as requested.

Maybe it's just me but they didn't taste anywhere near as great as they looked.

 Now, I DID very much enjoy the crab legs but to be honest you can get that at a bunch of other Vegas buffets.  Also, is it just me or does the Wynn Buffet seem to attract the trashiest Asian people?  (hey, don't get all crazy on me now, I'm Asian too!)

Back then the dress code wasn't that strict, but when reading the sign, it didn't say anything about cropped tops. Opaque cover ups\/ proper attire. Hmmmmmm.....

Jalanya was our cashier. She had another employee standing behind her and another one just outside their station. So we walk up, and instantly I see her eyes go to my sisters outfit. Right away I already know there is going to be a problem. 

The girl behind Jalanya picks up a phone and is already talking to a manager. Meanwhile we are standing their confused because the employees are mumbling amongst each other, but not addressing us as the customer. I basically had to come out and ask them, they said they were getting a manager. Manager never showed. Sister had to wear a sweater over he outfit. 

Fine, so we look around and everyone is pretty much not showing any skin. What do they do when there are groups going to the clubs and they want buffet? Do you show them out because of their indecency?

Well before I get to the food, let me divulge a bit more. We are seated and continue with our meal. Low and behold, some very scantily clad  females show up. Two Asians in see through or opaque tops. One wearing a black bra and the other nude but it's darker than she is so you totally see it. The one with the nude bra also has a skirt that is higher on one side than the other. So her left butt cheek is almost showing. 

Later two younger girls with jeans and crop tops come in. WTF! So they are just bare as can be. You can tell them kind of tried to yank their pants as high as Steve Urkel. They also tried to slouch their shoulders.  

If you want your guests to abide by a strict dress code than you need to list what is and is not appropriate. Basically they did not treat all their guests to the same standards which is quite upsetting. 

The cashiers and hostess staff were all quite rude and not very polite. What I got from their attitudes was that they acted better than the people they were serving. You work in the friggin customer service industry, you better be polite and courteous. It's your job, it's what you get paid for. If you don't like it, go work somewhere else. 


Okay onto the crappy food.

The soups were blah. Lobster bisque tasted more like shrimp. The chicken noodle tasted basic, and the noodles were all too soft. The watermelon was old because the melon was starting to deteriorate. 

The salads were an every day type thing, nothing special. The fish fishes were so badly overcooked, sitting under heat lamps killed them. The pizza looked under done, pale crust and pale cheese. 

The pasta was blah- seafood with orriccheti (the ear shaped pasta) had hardly any seafood. The penne with meatballs or maybe it was ziti with meatballs, was okay. The meatballs were a bit dry and flavorless. The chicken parm with tomato sauce was bland and not crispy or hot. 

The prime rib was well done. The ribeye was cut with the grain and made it soooo chewy. It was chargrilled, it was more like burned and charcoal flavored. The turkey was overly dry looking. 

The latke tasted like rehydrated potato shreds, that then got made into piles. The wagyu was terrible, stringy and chewy.  The salmon and capers wasn't bad.

Asian section: sushi rice was hard, items not marked properly, and it was all just blah. Despite that I came for the crab. They only had snow and jonah crab claws. That was disappointing. The snow was a mixed batch. Some were extremely salty and others not. The Jonah claws were overcooked and the meat was terrible. 

Our waiter who got our drinks was pretty nice. For the most part of top of it.

The buffet at Wynn is beautiful, clean, with a modern french twist of new and old. The presentation and quality is excellent. The food is fresh and well made. 
I love their fresh breads (try the dark brown one, it so good).
I love their prime rib, nice and juicy and tender. All to medium rare to medium.
The slab bacon was quite nice and peppery.
I love that they had a deli meats and cheese bar.
The fruit bar was quite nice too, fresh fruits; all beautiful.
There drinks and service are real good too, but what do you expect if you pay around $50 for brunch.
But that was about it. I wished I liked all the things there but I don't.
The biggest disappointment for me is the desserts.
The dessert were beautiful and well kept.
But they tasted too sweet or the flavor combination just did not work.
In the end I only like the cream puff they had in the desserts, and that was only after I took some of the large sugar crystals off the puff crust.
It was just too much when the cream is already sweet. But that is only my preference. I feel like that need to go back to some basics (flavors) of desserts before going for the decadent stuff. Rice pudding with caramel mousse is a example....  of flavors that clashed when it became to sweet. As well as my raspberry and lime dessert combo when my lime was super strong and tart mixed with the raspberry.
Maybe I arrived on a bad day...

The service was okay- we has stacks of plates sitting at the table for at least 15 minutes before one of the waitstaff came to pick up the food.

The red snapper was left out for too long, had a fishy smell, and was hard on one end for being under the heat for so long. 

The egg whites were watery and had the texture of cottage cheese.
The smoked salmon was out for far to long  as well and also had a really bad fishy smell. 

The only saving grace for this buffet was the dessert station- filled with delicious mini pastries and delicious pretzel bars!!! 

My suggestion is to avoid Wynn Buffett  and head to Cosmo's Wicked spoon due to the quality, service, and overall presentation- not to mention it's cheaper than the Wynn buffet",0,0,0

The food here is basically a high quality version of other vegas buffets. The food was good. Service was good. I came during brunch, so they had a lot of breakfast food. The salad bar was big, lots of varieties. Dessert was great. They had my favorite dessert cake (tres leches) in shot glass size cup, which i liked because that prevented me from getting too much.

The buffet at the Wynn, on the other hand, was rather enjoyable.  Yes, just as other reviewers have confessed, I stuffed myself perhaps a bit too much, slipping into a food coma or post-meal narcolepsy.  Despite such crime against the pancreas\/liver (with a minimum of 1000 calories in fat and carbs), I must say the food was delicious.  The prime rib and the king crab legs were my favorite. The dessert bar was a sweet tooth's absolute heaven (or haven).  Their creme brulee was by far my favorite, and I believe I went through 4 of them just to crack the top and eat the crispy, caramelized sugar.

The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and we wouldn't think twice about staying there, however, there is NO way we will ever go back to the Buffet.  Like friends of ours we went at a perfect time, breakfast, but still there for the lunch.  It is a shame when you spend over $50 for two people and my one and only favorite item was the oatmeal.  I tried several other of their dishes, but each was a complete disappointment to the palete.  Little to no seasoning on anything.  I do have to say though, that the presentation is totally adorable and that is the only reason they get a star.  We tried the frittata, yuck, bland and no flavor.  Eggs benedict wasn't even appealing to sight.  Eggs were runny and no flavor and the breakfast meats were just ok.  We had hoped that as they switched out breakfast to lunch that the selections would be better, and the answer was a HUGE NO.  My husband said that if we had paid for the lunch price, we would have asked for a refund.  All I have to say is if you want some amazing food, where pretty much all of the selections are tasty and appealing, then head over to the Carnival World buffet, NOW that is worth the cost.  Don't let the Wynn's beauty deceive you into to beleiving that the food would be just as beautiful.

I've been coming here about 2-3 times a year, ever since it opened, and if I yelped about it anytime before the last time-- I would've given it 4 to 5 stars.  But I went couple of weeks ago, and must say it was a true disappointment.  Just a year ago, I waited in the line for 2 hours to pay about $50 for this buffet and come back out saying it was well worth it.  The last time I went, I was very surprised that the line was very short.  We waited about 15 minutes AND the price went down to just about $35. But once we were seated and go to eat, I knew there was a reason why the line was short and why the price went down. By the time the 2nd plate came around, I had no more to eat.  Everyone was disappointed and we wondered where all the food went?

True, the buffet is obviously not your average Home Town Buffet, but from what it was before, it was very disappointing.  Still, from the few selection that they have, the quality is still superb, and they still offer cut open crab legs.

Anyway....after the buffet we came to a conclusion: we are NOT buffet people.  

By buffet standards, I'm sure Wynn is just amazing--think really good wedding food--but it just wasn't our thing.  By the end of our 2nd plates, we were both feeling full and by the end of our 3rd plates, we were completely numb to the delights of food but still wanted to try the desserts.  Once you get to that point, nothing really tastes delicious or special so I can't even tell you if the dessert was awesome or not.

I wouldn't do the Wynn buffet again but that's just because I couldn't appreciate ALL THAT FOOD.  They get my 3 stars for the fact that they did have a lot of food and much of it was tasty.  I would have given it 4 stars but service was pretty bad and no one was pleasant; this was a surprise because the rest of the staff at Wynn\/Encore were all very friendly.

If you like buffets though, I recommend it.  Here are some things that I enjoyed:
The sea bass (the flavor was super delicious but it was a little mushy)
The herb hash brown balls (amazing!!!)
 1\/2 mini baguette which I ate with butter and edam cheese
Small cheese roll that I ate with capicola
California roll (the only thing that saved it was that it was made with real crab)
Steamed leek, pork & shrimp in a wonton-like wrapper
Pork pot sticker
Stir-fry veggies
Pistachio\/apricot cake
Chocolate oreo cake

Stuff that was passable:
French toast--too much cinnamon for my taste
Mini waffle--too chewy and limp...the bacon was the same
Spicy tuna hand roll, & veggie roll - the sushi at my local cheapy Chinese buffet is better!!!
Cha shu bao--the dough and bbq pork both lacked flavor so all that was left was overwhelming sweetness
The mashed potatoes--they were pretty good but nothing to write home about

The rest of the stuff on my 4 plates (total) were just so-so miscellaneous nibbles and bites

We got our buffet free thanks to slot play using our Red Card\/ hotel room card but if I was paying, I would have felt compelled to cram A LOT more in my belly.  Most of the slot play points were based on betting the winnings from our free slot credit so it really was a nearly free buffet.  

If you like to gamble, use the Red Card...you get 1 point for every $3 you spend and if it's your 1st visit, you get a free buffet at 55 points.

If going on the weekend, here's a tip: go right before the end of brunch, then you can enjoy brunch and dinner food while saving yourself from the dinner pricing. Yes, I know that is probably a popular tip, but still a good one.

The first trip was back in October 2010 with my mom and cousins. The food was awesome. This was a while back, so I don't remember exactly what I had but I remember it being great.

The second trip, which I'll describe in more detail was this past weekend (September 24, 2011). I'm mainly eating vegetarian these days, and I went with my vegan bff. I was excited to try this place and try the vegan options since I eat a lot of vegan food and heard that the Wynn was vegan friendly. In short, I was pretty much blown away.  

The chef came out to give us a tour of what was vegan and vegetarian on the buffet line. We got there at the end of brunch so breakfast foods were mainly out, though he told us some things that would be coming later that were vegetarian\/vegan friendly. He truly was knowledgable too. Most people, even some chefs don't know that marshmallows are not vegetarian, but he did know that...so I feel like he did really know his stuff. 

As for the food, there is a lot too keep even a picky vegan like my bff satisfied. The pasta station has vegan alfredo, vegan meat sauce, and even vegan ravioli that were super delicious.  There were delicious quinoa and corn cakes as well. Even vegan desserts like coconut sorbet, mango\/coconut\/lime mousse.  I loved the curried lentils and chickpeas as well. My very favorite item was the sweet pea risotto (vegetarian, not vegan). I could have eaten more and more of that.",3,0,1

Let's be quite frank: food service sucks. Working in it sucks. Waiting in line to pay $40 and being anything but thrilled or compensated the expectation you thought you deserved...well, sucks!

The facts are that the food on loan to your stomach has great variety and first quality. I had the most buttery prime rib ever, and you can wait in line to get shrimp, octopus, crab legs (pre cut, in half, and easy to feed on) and other seafoods.

As my second visit in about 3 years, I couldn't recall if there was an Indian food feature the first time I went, but this time they had the most unsightly Indian food section ever. It certainly didn't look like Indian food. They used supermarket pita bread, all the wrong food dyes, and like the rest of Vegas, it just seemed to be contrived.

However, it tasted AMAZING. How did they pull it off? If you are reading this review on your cell while waiting in line, and have a hankering for ""dahl"" (lentils in a kind of pea soup), save some room in your stomach.

4 stars for quality disregarding price (too much, hit the Paris buffet for a cheaper experience with a greater array of foods), and waiting in line for at least 1.5 hours on a weekday. Those prior two reasons are why it's not a full 5 stars.

Be not mistaken: the Wynn buffet is overrated. But that's not their fault. Nobody's going to say the food sucks, and that's what makes this place so phenomenal.",0,0,0

The pasta dishes were pretty good, though I tend to stay away from such dishes at buffets.  The prime rib was good, not dry, and the medium rare piece i requested was actually medium rare!  They also served rack of lamb, beef tenderloin, fried chicken, and other meat dishes as well.  The dinner menu includes crab legs, and the line gets long once the legs are brought out.  Besides the crab legs they have sushi (avg at best), various fish dishes, prawns and cocktail shrimp.  Except for the sushi, all the seafood mentioned above were good.

The carving station was very good, and they have a very good seafood selection. I'm sure dinner would have more things to offer, but I don't really wanna pay close to 40 bucks.

We rolled in about 5 roller derby girls deep and hit this buffet hard. The only dress code requirement was that we had an opaque cover up on - thankfully, we did (this time).  The line was about 45 minutes late, which was cutting into our viable gorging time. 

On average, we each ate three plates with different strategies for approaching this buffet: I steered clear of the starches to maximize consumption, Donna focused on the seafood, Lauren went light on the main courses and then slammed down some serious desserts. And, of course, we had endless glasses of Diet Coke poured non-stop. 

While one might scoff at the price, $40 buys you not only an inhumane amount of food, with a wide vegan menu, but it also buys you faux-ostrich leather walls and chairs.

For breakfast, I was very impressed with the omelette station, the variety of smoked fish, and the great selection of fresh and dried fruits, yogurts and granola. My omelette was packed full of my requested toppings and perfectly cooked - and I was unsure how high my expectations should be given the line of people the cook had waiting for him. Even for vegans and celiacs, there were tons of options - ie., I'm not even mentioning the large portions of the buffet that I didn't touch, for example sausages, pancakes, waffles, bacon, toast, cereal, etc. 

There were also Mexican and Chinese food options available for breakfast; I tried the corn frittata and the hot bean mixture from the former and the pineapple fried rice from the latter, all of which were very tasty.

For dinner, there is an even larger selection of cuisine types available. My personal favourite was the antipasto station with an awesome array of meats, cheeses, olives, dried fruits and nuts, and spreads such as hummus, baba ghanouj, and olive and artichoke tapanades. I also absolutely loved the sweet pea risotto (and I don't usually like peas!) and the Thai basil rice noodle stir fry. Not to mention the hot and cold seafood options - I only tried the smoked salmon and a small bite of a couple of the hot fish dishes because I was enjoying everything else so much, but the crab legs looked impressive.  Again, there is a ton that I am not even mentioning, for example the sushi, the pasta bar and pizza in the Italian section, the Chinese section, and the American section with fresh carved turkey and roast beef for the meat and potatoes crowd. Point being, once again, options galore. 

Although a celiac and not a big dessert person, I would be remiss to mention the buffet without raving about the dessert station. Even though I couldn't eat them, you couldn't help but be charmed and impressed by the little cups full of cute little dessert creations, as well as the cupcakes and other assorted goodies. As for what I could have, the gelato station made me feel like a kid ordering an old fashioned ice cream sundae, and there were a few other excellent gluten free options, including but not limited to fresh fruit.

The atmosphere was lovely, the seating space was very large so we didn't have to wait too long, and the service was great, especially for a buffet. Yes, it is on the pricey side, but absolutely worth it for the variety and quality of the food. Also, my absolute favourite part? For dinner, for an extra $10, you can get all-you-can-drink mimosas, champagne and Bloody Marys. Every time we went to grab some more food, the drink that we ordered was waiting for us when we got back to our table. Perfect!",3,1,0

Besides the obstacle course of the line, when you actually reach the front and get seated, it is definitely well worth it. The design of the buffet was very spacious. The entrance is like an Alice in Wonderland theme park (the hotel has the same type of theme- very magical feeling). Each type of cuisine was divided up into stations, so if you wanted Italian, you can go to the Italian section, etc. They had everything from shirmp cocktail to dimsum.The dessert section located in the middle was TO DIE FOR.

""Mystere"" was way overpriced and way too confusing for me to enjoy. **

If I had to use one word to describe The Buffet at Wynn it would be: overrated. At around $35 a person for dinner, with many people claiming it to be the ""best buffet in Vegas"", I had great expectations for my dining experience at The Buffet. These expectations, however, crumbled under The Buffet's inability to truly ""WOW"" me.
The best item served was definitely the Alaskan King Crab Legs, which are already split for you to pluck out the meat and drench it in strained butter. The pasta station (while not very unique) is also quite fun if you employ a little imagination. I grabbed a bowl of cocktail shrimp and had the chef grill it with garlic, mushrooms and add it to a creamy sauce.
But, the brightest spot of the whole night lay probably in the dessert area. The creme brulee was delicious, not too eggy, just the right consistency and it made just the right ""crunch"" when I broke the delectable candied top. And the homemade ice creams...those were fantastic! The best, by far, was the mango. It tasted almost exactly like a fresh mango, without all the sinewy stuff and without a large seed waiting for you in the middle.
The downside of The Buffet, was that most everything else on the menu was average. The prime rib was slightly overcooked and had barely any taste. The sushi was comparable to that of any local supermarket. And, the rest of the desserts were just a step up from Hometown Buffet.

All in all, my experience at The Buffet was slightly above average, but the question is: who wants to pay $35 for an above average meal?

One of the dishes that impressed me the most was their King Crab legs.

If I just use the KCL as a yardstick, I believe this buffet uses fresh and high quality ingredients for their food.  Yes, the price is high at times, but you get what you pay for.

We ate there around Easter last year, dinner was at a holiday price for the special holiday menu with many extra food. IIRC, it was like $5 more than their regular price (which I forgot already.)

            The only foods that I can remember I liked was the King crab and the pot stickers, everything else was just mediocre. The dessert selection was just terrible, kinda like the Golden Corral quality. Common, what's all this hype? I've tried just about every buffet restaurant in Vegas at the major casinos and only one stands out above all and that's the Bellagio hands down. They even give you silverware. The worst part of the Wynn buffet is the dessert selection, compare it to Bellagio, $27.95  and it'll speak for itself.  Why waste your money and not get what you pay for?  All in all It depends on what you like. 

           Everyone runs for the crab and prime rib and that's all there is to talk about there on the main meal. I was told there was gelato! what gelato? I know what gelato looks and taste like and they did not have any. Some people are making false statements about the food at the Wynn. They must have been too hungry to know the difference in food qualtiy. Sushi? ha, it was a total joke!  Your local grocery store has better. Common, are people supposed to be taken this stupid? They should leave out foods they do not know how to make. It leaves a bad taste to remember. Someone mentioned the food quality at the Wynn is better than the Bellagio! are you serious! you can't be serious. No way is it even close. I'm sure most will agree. 

              From the start, Bellagio compared to the Wynn. Better meat selection, better sushi (although I see it sub par), best in dessert hands down, better service, and of course better pricing.

At first glance, the food looked good! However, i wasn't too impressed when I started eating. I was not wowed as I would be when i tried other buffets like at the Cosmo, or even Paris. I would think that Wynn would try to compete with the bigger Casinos when it came to food, but apparently they might be competing with the likes of World Buffet. 

Their dessert section was kind of embarrassing. I think hometown buffet has a bigger selection than these guys. They had the usual ice cream, cakes, and they had an eye appetizing Candy Apple. I was actually really excited to try the candy apple since it looked like it was the best thing that was being displayed on their dessert selection. I was curious as to why i didn't see one person reach for it, but I soon realised why. It was only made to be an eye pleaser... The candy shell was hard as a ROCK. It's impossible to bite through it, you literally have to take a knife, place the apple on the table, and smack it. And even then, the hard shell barely cracked. I can't believe that they put rock candy on their apple, it was completely inedible. For 3 minutes, i tried cracking the shell with my knife to get to the apple, but I failed. The only thing that I had from that dessert was the rock candy, which wasn't even that good.

Tip: Since it takes about an hour wait. Why not get a late lunch, stand in line by 2PM, get in at 3PM and pay for the lunch price and at 3:30PM, they switch the lunch menu to the dinner menu? You get the best of both worlds! So genius I should have thought of it sooner! Foolish me...",3,4,0

For dinner the thing that I liked best was that they cut in half the snow crab legs for you! Yes! All you have to do is use your fork, stab the meat, yank it out and eat it!  True laziness. 

And they have ceviche! octopus ceviche! they had rabbit pasta! I think i ate enough lamb there in all these different forms, leg of lamb, t-bone lamb, lamb chops that i may turn into one and run off with the flock and bo peep!

The food on the buffet is a little more gourmet than the Bellagio, some specific items that stood out were the hand carved slab bacon and Eggs Benedict with Jalape√±o Hollandaise Sauce. There was a wide assortment of breakfast and lunch items as well as an impressive array of deserts.

One the negative side was the service. Based on observation, this was limited to our waitress and not indicative of the entire staff. The gentleman who was bussing tables provided us with better service than the waitress who was supposed to be taking care of us. Also, the omelet bar did not have the variety of ingredients that the Bellagio buffet has. This was a letdown for such a well appointed buffet.

Another item  I have a personal issue with was one item on the buffet. The were serving Mako Shark with a teriyaki glaze. Sharks are being over fished and serving this particular item on a buffet is deplorable and is enough reason for me to never eat at the Wynn again.

Overall, this is a good buffet with a huge assortment of gourmet foods. I would truly like to see them stop serving shark. Given the choice, I'll eat at the buffet at the Bellagio every time, but this is still a viable alternative.",1,0,1

At this point, I am still convinced that it's totally going to be worth it.  But alas, turns out they have a strictly enforced dress code.  My guy friend, who had chosen to wear a tank top, was told that he could either change his shirt or buy the Wynn Buffet shirt for $20.

I'm giving this buffet 5-stars with a little bias because of how well they catered to me as a celiac and for their dessert!! Btw, nearly 4000 reviews and I couldn't find the word ""gluten"" in any of them? Where are all my fellow celiacs? gluten-intolerants? Speak up! lol! 

*GLUTEN-FREE NOTE* (gluten, celiacs) 
Ask the head chef! He gave me a gluten-free tour and it was awesome! The dessert section had 5 different desserts that I could eat gluten-free! The ""magic bar"" and the guava pannacotta** was to die for. Guys, don't bother with buffets cheaper or lower quality than this, they'll have very little to eat if anything and probably only ice cream for dessert...lol

My brief-ish breakdown :) for my few followers lol

Food: 4 - The options for gluten-free are few, but awesome. (Potatoes!)
Service: 4.5 They were nice, prompt, but it's a buffet so not that much interaction
Ambience: 5 (bias, I LOVE causal) Resort casual! (shoes, shirts lol) but oh man this place was BEAUTIFUL and bright! What a great lunch ambience. 
Price: 5* Vegas biased (Like $27 for lunch I think?) I gotta say it's friggin worth that price, especially in VEGAS {Dinner is like $39 I think, sorry no review from me for that)

**because of my ignorance I didn't realize pannacotta is typically made with gelatin (until after I was finished with it) and didn't ask if it was halal. So if Halal\/Kosher food is your thing, ask about that. It was freaking delicious though lol XD

Alright, for a bit more deets...if you like to read lol :) 

Food: Those double-whipped potatoes were insane. I can't believe how delicous they were and arguably the best mashed\/whipped potatoes I've ever had!! The salad options were fun and creative, watermelon and feta was very classy and the ingredients were all crisp and fresh! The sliced cheese was also very tasty. 
The wine-braised hangar steak was so much better than I expected. Considering that hangar steak is usually very tough, I was really surprised at how tender it was! My one critique: don't cut with the grain..lol
If you like smokedsalmon then woah are you in for a treat! Even smoked salmon rolls! I loved the cooked fish options too. 
..
Now dessert....oh yeah. That's REALLY why I wanted to put in the review. Mango tapioca, guava panaccotta, magic bar...I'm in love. I haven't had dessert in so long since it's hard to eat dessert out, and there aren't many gluten-free bakeries where I live so I was ecstatic. 
And I didn't have any reactions! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

Ambience: Seriously, this place was really pretty. Flowers at the entrance, really classy hostess and waiter\/waitress outfits, bright and open set up and the food was prepared in small very attractive portions. You really just get a happy and bright feeling, especially that it's for lunch. There's this HUGE fruit and flower structure-like decoration that greets you upon entering, and it's all really Vegas-y haha

Service: The hostess\/waitresses were courteous and helpful and prompt to clear your table. Considering it's a buffet, not that much more interaction. 
But the chefs at like EVERY dining station were superb! I mentioned the head chef's (EL GLUTEN FREE JEFE WOOP) gluten-free tour (don't get confused that only the potatoes say gluten-free, I don't think they've updated all the signs) They were so happy to help, customize and accomdate. The turkey station chef got me dark meat when I asked, the slices of the steak were really nicely portioned and the omelette chef was ADORABLE! 

Price: I have no complaints. For what we paid, I paid more for crappy mexican at the blue iguana. This was so worth it. I can't comment on the price for dinner since I'm rating for lunch, but if you can get your lazy butts awake and there for lunch time do it! Especially if you're a celiac. 

Hope this helps! Have a great time everyone :) 

THANK YOU to the Wynn for giving me gluten-free options, you really made my stay much more enjoyable having been able to enjoy a great vegas buffet for a great price. I left so full, and I NEVER eat until I'm stuffed but man was I stuffed!

I have been a loyal supporter of the Bellagio buffet for an incredibly long time. While there are numerous buffet restaurants in Vegas, I never felt any of them are comparable to Bellagio in terms of the price\/quality ratio. 

At around four on a Monday afternoon there were already a short line of people waiting at the restaurant. That was a very promising sign. I wait patiently and was seated in about 15 minutes. Drinks were served promptly. 

I quickly walked through the trays of food. The selection is good. They have a good variety of Asian cuisine on top of the usual pasta, cold plates, salad, seafood and craving stations. Of everything I have tried, I was most impressed with the prime rib (I am always partial towards juicy pieces of meat), veal loin and vegetable in yogurt sauce. Overall most of the dishes are on par with Bellagio except for the desserts. Bellagio desserts are top notch while Wynn's were just mediocre at best. The creme brulee was watery at the bottom and the top wasn't fully torched. The dessert was not as delicate as they were in Bellagio. Perhaps it wasn't peak dinner time yet and the food was sitting out a little longer than usual. Still, that was rather unacceptable. If you must know, Wynn does have a slightly better sushi station but I really wouldn't recommend getting sushi at either place unless you like soggy seaweed on dry sushi rice.

At $43 a person, there is definitely plenty of food for meat lovers, sushi lovers, pasta lovers and vegetarians alike.

A few goodies at the buffet: salmon hand rolls, pesto pasta, prime rib.  Those were my favorites.  Everything else was just average.  Cheese selection was rather pathetic.

That being said, I liked their roasted duck on a bun with hoison sauce, along with their pork buns.  Their veal short rib was meh, as was their cold crab legs.  The crab legs are really the same as everyone else and not anything to write home about.  Of the things that I ate, nothing was mind blowing or so fantastic that I craved to go again.  

The dessert selection might be a tad better than the Bellagio per say, but honestly, for the price and hype, it fell short of expectations.  Maybe it was because it was Tuesday night?  I don't know.  It just didn't have the wow factor I thought it would.  May have to try the buffet at Caesar's to compare in October.  Either way, go for yourself and judge.  Who knows, maybe it will do for you what it didn't do for me.",1,1,1

Celebrated NYE in Vegas & spent most of New Year's Day recovering. The girlfriend & I managed only one meal that day, the Buffet at the Wynn. As far as buffets go, there was a good variety of food, most of it was good, some of it very good, a few things not so much. Also as far as buffets go, the Wynn was pricey.

seafood, mexican, carving station, made-to-order omelet station, asian (including sushi, some dim sum and congee), italian, salad bar, fruit, and an extensive dessert section with cakes, pies, cookies, etc. i didn't even get to that section because i gorged myself on everything else.

No way could we pass up a bonafide Vegas buffet - especially a fancified one. It took us about an hour to get seated. However - I would do it all again. If interested, consider the following list...

1. Sunday brunch cost is $31.99 and you can upgrade to bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys for $10 more. I opted for the Bloody Marys and they were the real deal!

2. Omelette bar, Congee bar, Meat Carving bar, Salad bar - on this particular day the Meat Carving bar was serving Prime Rib with horseradish sauce, brown gravy, beef au jus, and grain mustard as well as house-made side bacon.

3. Dim Sum options - eggrolls, BBQ pork buns, and gyoza.

4. Seafood options - citrus glazed salmon, shrimp cocktail, squid ceviche (amazingly delicious), and a soy glazed mahi mahi.

5. Soup bar - Chicken Tortilla, Chicken Noodle and probably 2 more options.

6. An Antipasti bar - cured meats, cheese, fancy Italian cookies.

7. A dessert ROOM - cupcakes, gelato and ice cream, danishes and pastries, cookies, mini cakes, a myriad of fancy mousses - red velvet, coconut, dark chocolate, s'mores.

8. Cornflake crusted fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, pulled pork, cornbread - to appease your comfort food cravings.

9. An array of other brunchy foods - waffles, pancakes, crepes, applewood bacon, sausage links and patties. 

10. There was more I promise...can't recall it all - I'm getting flashbacks of sushi options, pastas, and a delicious succotash of lima beans, peppers and corn.

Not to mention that since I'm vegetarian I end up feeling a little jipped since I can't try all the options. Nevertheless, the weekend brunch was only $35 so not too bad.

But the selection at the seafood station seemed to be limited.  I expected more dishes.       

My omelet was made quick to perfection.  The thin crust pizzas impressed me!  At the carving station, it was all about the pepper crusted bacon!  Prime rib was average.  The desserts were not only plentiful, but also were nice to look at.

First - we had skipped lunch, so my boyfriend and I were unbelievably hungry which should have put the ball in wynns court. Still didn't do it.

The salads were great - the best part of the buffet. Loved the Greek salad and the roasted chickpeas.
The sushi was average - nothing exciting. The Chinese was really quite poor. The duck dumpling station was closed and the other concoctions were chewy and tasteless.
The prime rib was great. Best anywhere. The rest of the meat was only average and the pastas were dry. The thing that put me over the edge was that the seafood was absolutely terrible. I'm a huge seafood fan - salmon, sea bass I love it all. The salmon was sweet and horribly dry and the choice to put olives over the sea bass.. totally questionable. This was the first time I had ever spat out sea bass. Poor little guy. Makes me want to give them 2 stars.
Finally the desserts were honestly just average. There was one fancy peanut butter chocolate thing that was delicious but everything else tasted like it had been frozen or left out all day.
So minus one star for sea food and another for lack of creativity. 3 stars for the salad and veggie options (great Brussel sprouts!), beautiful decor and having such a variety. I didn't even eat half of the stuff there.

1) Desserts are definitely the strong suit at the Wynn. If that's your bag, save room. Better yet, start in the dessert room and work your way out. 
2) Prime rib, I'll admit, was huge and good. However, the old server guy who carved it didn't like that I took the au jus from the fuller well in front of me, and chastised me for it. What's up with that?
3) The husband loved the sea bass and the tandoori salmon (shoulder shrug).

Now the lowlights:
1)What happened to having sushi or sashimi at Vegas buffets? Neither Mandalay nor Wynn had more than a single platter of mushy-riced\/ soft-seaweed product. Bleh. 
2) People who load up on those crab legs must not know what crab legs should taste like: like CRAB not like eating SALT.

The atmosphere was nice and bright. Everything was clean and they provided beautiful silverware with cloth napkins (nice touch!) to give it that fine dining feel.

So, what is so great about it? Let me break it down (based on my personal experience):

SEAFOOD:
- We hit up the Alaskan crab legs first! They were all pre-cracked\/cut and ready to eat. They had a warm butter station to go with it.
- Shrimp, cocktail style with seafood sauce. Classic stuff. Shrimp was a nice size, very tender and delicious.
- Sushi rolls were all fresh and prepared beautifully with good quality fish.
- Arugula salad with red\/yellow peppers topped with anchovy. My mouth just watered as I typed that. Enough said.

MEAT:
- Lamb roast: cooked to about medium, tender, served with mint jelly
- Prime rib: cooked to about medium, tender, served with horseradish

POTATOES\/VEGETABLES:
- Garlic mashed potatoes, another classic. Perfectly cooked and nice texture.
- Squash and root vegetables. Glazed in maple syrup - awesome!

DESSERT:
- Crepe, strawberry. Made to order as the crepe chef makes it right in front of you. Fantastic.
- Cream puff: pastry was light and fluffy with a delicious cream filling
- Strawberry cheesecake: served in a little cup...MMMMmmm.
- Mint chocolate gelato: Served by a buffet staff member\/chef. Sooooooo good.

Alright, there were a few other things that I'm sure I tried and can only remember that they tasted EXCELLENT, but can't remember the names of them right now.

This was just a small portion of what was actually available at this buffet. Me and my loved one enjoyed every bit of it! The other great thing was that we didn't feel sick after (as most buffets usually make you feel). Everything was fresh, excellent quality and ALL fully digestible :P

I highly recommend this buffet. Enjoy!",5,1,0

This was our first meal on our trip to Vegas last week and it was a great start to our vacation. Even better, we got the buffets free. If you sign up for Wynn's Red Card and earn 25 points (which both of us did spending around $25 each) you get a free buffet - worth $33 each!! The food was so good though, that I wouldn't have complained if I did pay full price.
As many other reviews have already said, the choices are amazing and the quality and presentation outstanding. 
Highlights:
Loin lamb chops
Tandoori chicken
Crab legs (so sweet butter wasn't necessary)
Prime rib
Coconut icecream
Caramel eclairs

Avoid these:
Any cooked fish (all dry and flavorless)
Ceviche (tasted only of citrus)

Service at dinner was very attentive; barely pushed a plate aside and it was wisked away so I didn't have to bear witness to my gluttony.

Returned for breakfast on our last day. Service wasn't quite as efficient but was acceptable. Outstanding selection of breakfast fare. My favorite - the huge bowl of fresh raspberries and the guacamole (not together tho!!). They had great bacon, 4 kinds of sausage, lots of egg dishes, homemade granola was very tasty. Also had Mexican and Asian selections for those who like non-breakfast food (to Americans anyway).

If we had time, I would have gone back again for lunch. We finished up breakfast just as they switched over to lunch food but I was too stuffed with breakfast to even try anything. Main difference I could see between lunch and dinner was more soups, salads at lunch, no crab legs and leg of lamb rather than chops. 
Any meal of day this place would be well worth a visit. Thanks Yelpers for cluing me in to the best buffet in Vegas.",3,0,1

I was super excited about the Gelato, but once again, it disappointed me. I don't think it was worth $27 for lunch. This is for lunch only though. May be dinner is A LOT better.

The best? I went back again & again to the taco bar. Perfectly cooked and seasoned carne asada. The white truffle mashed potatoes were also great.

But do I really want to spend $50 on a buffet to get great tacos & mashed potatoes?

Could have been better? Crab legs and shrimp were a little disappointing. I would have been happy with them at a $12 buffet but not at 4x that price.

If you're used to buffets, the selection here is decent, quality is very mediocre. If i remember correctly, I think the Bellagio has a better selection. 

The Wynn kind of separates it by genre of food... here's some highlights of what they had:
- Asian: egg rolls, har how (shrimp dumplings), pork buns, shrimp fried rice, stir fried veggies with tofu, basic sushi, edamame, 
- Seafood: a bunch of shellfish -- sorry i didn't pay too much attention?
- Meats\/carving station: 5 spice chinese chicken, carved turkey, ribs, prime rib
- Breakfast: ricotta crepettes, waffles, eggs, egg whites, oatmeal
- Comfort foods: 'artisanal breads', pizza, mac and cheese, pasta, fish and chips, fries, chicken noodle soup
- 'Healthy' area: fruit, muesli with berries, yogurt + berries, yogurt station, green tea chia pudding, tabbouleh, marinated veggie salad
- Desserts: so SO many things to choose from, though they didn't really hit the spot: ice cream, cookies, candied apples, chocolate tarts, green tea muffins... there's 1 whole room dedicated to dessert and it feels like willy wonka's chocolate factory

Made to order items: omelettes, pancakes, crepes
Vegan + vegetarian friendly including vegan chocolate chip muffins

Because of this, I have visited this buffet 3 times.  I, on the other hand, am like most Yelpers; I am happy if the price of my food matches the level and quality of my dining experience.

Ambience:  The seating area is beautiful, particularly if you can be seated in the garden\/atrium.  Towers of flowers adorn the room, so it makes for a very pleasant and aromatic dining experience.

Food:  Another reviewer described this buffet as a ""Jack of all trades, master of none.""  This is exactly my sentiment.  The buffet is stacked with many, many options and a spread of international cuisines.  There are also lots of vegetarian options.  The chilled seafood is decent- usually they have king crab legs, which is pretty amazing.  And the desserts are bite-sized, so you can try several of them without feeling too guilty.  However, there is nothing that is prepared in any exceptional way.  The lobster quiche is dry, noodles can be pretty bland, and the sushi tastes like the kind you get at the grocery store.

Price:  On a normal, non-holiday weekday (Monday-Friday), the buffet charges $25.99 for lunch and $39.99 for dinner.  My last visit was Friday, January 2, for lunch.  During that visit, the buffet was $39.99 per person, which is $14 more than the usual rate.  The reason was that this was their ""Holiday weekend"" price....despite that it was neither a weekend nor a holiday.  For anyone like me who plans their trip in advance and prices out a food budget, this was an unwelcome surprise.

Service:  The servers are friendly and polite, but the seating staff and managers are not.  Expect to wait in line (we arrived at 10:50am for lunch and waited 45 minutes), but this last time a cocktail waitress did come around and offer us bottled water, which was nice.

Overall, I have had so much good food at beautiful restaurants in Vegas (Buddy V's, Mon Ami Gabi, Cafe Society, and Burgr all come to mind) that standing in line for an exorbitantly-priced, mediocre buffet seems absurd.  So for me, there are only two reasons to waste your time and money on this buffet:  (1) Money is no object, or (2) The existence of food options outrank quality.",2,1,1

We had the brunch buffet here before we had to leave in a few hours. The atmosphere was nice with decorative walls, floors and flower arrangements; however, the buffet itself wasn't that great. 

First off, if you're standing at the salad bar and looked at the shellfish section, you'd think the food would go around but that was misleading because it was just a dead end. The salad didn't look that appealing and I tried the pad thai was not even close to being godo (it was cold and had no flavor), sushi was mediocre, the pizza was cold and hard, and there wasn't a lot of seafood selection. 

On the other hand, what's interesting is that honey glazed peppercorn bacon...quite unique. The first time I got it, it was too fatty and the second time was a tad better. The leek cakes were good...the skin was thin and were nicely made. In terms of the dessert, the lemon and strawberry sorbet were really good (I added some oreo cookie crumbs). I eyed this sparkly cupcake and ended up taking one because of its appearance; however, one bite of the ""icing"" or fondant it didn't taste good so I spat it out. 

Although I had a dinner buffet at the Bellagio, I found that the Bellagio buffet was better in terms of the seafood and freshness. At least I tried the Wynn buffet and wouldn't have to wonder about what it would be like to try the Wynn buffet... I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars.",1,0,0

We came here to have dinner before our Ka show and we waited a very long time in line. The line didn't seem to be too long, but as you get closer, it actually winds around and around. After our party of 6 paid 40 bucks for our meal, we had to wait another half hour to be seated. Not sure if it was because we had a larger party, but what annoyed me most was that they called our party and another party that actually was given a table with no wait after they paid. I believe the party was larger than ours, by like 1 or 2 persons. Not sure why we were not seated first. 
There was a lot of food to be offered here. All types that would please everyone's palate. My faves were the rack of lamb, which was cooked just right and their cheesecakes. What was really annoying about the guy cutting my rack of lamb was that he would ask me how many pieces I wanted and he made me stand there and make me wait a couple of minutes while he was cleaning his knife and station. He actually even grabbed another slab of the prime rib and cut the fat off while I was standing there waiting, even though he knew I only wanted the rack of lamb. Come on, I wanted to eat! It was kind of annoying, so I only went to him once. I didn't like the crab too much, but that is only because of preference, I'm not a big fan of cold seafood. The staff was sure to keep all the food stations full. The dessert bar was great, had aton of option, from gelato, ice cream and even crepes. i was not a big fan of our waiter, he took forever to bring me my drink and didn't even come by to refill it.

It was $35.95 and for that price, we were able to get the best of both worlds: breakfast and lunch. Oh wait, and a third world: DESSERTS. 

Breakfast: skip the eggs benedict, hit up the omelet station and the pork sausages. YUM.

Lunch: wasn't the biggest fan of any of their fish entrees or their sushi, the pastas were all right, ALL the potatoes (mashed, sweet potato + marshmallows, and roasted) were amazeballs, the prime rib and the bacon were very flavorful and didn't even need any extra sauces 

Dessert: die for the rocky road, pecan pie, and the key lime pie mousse, cheesecake was allright, bread pudding was not too shabsters, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the ice cream (but maybe you'll have better luck)... there's also a ton of pastries that I skipped out on but you'll find anything from croissants to danishes. 

We got here around 9:30 am so we didn't really have a wait but about an hour after we got there, there was a huge line. I'd definitely keep that in mind when planning out your time.

What this buffet does have is TONS of fresh seafood, like crab legs, peel & eat shrimp, a variety of sushi and quite a few fish dishes. There are stations of different cuisines, so you've got fresh Asian foods, make-you-own pasta dishes, pizzas, Mediterranean foods like lamb, hummus, olives, and tzatziki. Deli meats and cheeses so you could make a sandwich if you wanted. There are some salads, but they're of the strict-recipe type, like Caesar salad, and a few choices with a mesclun mix and some tomatoes. The beet salad was very good and I loved the couscous salad. Some of the stations are meant to be staffed, but they were frequently unmanned, so you just couldn't have whatever that dish was. I never saw an empty dish, but I wished they could have just pushed the tongs over to the patron's side so I could pick up my own piece of pre-cut meat or poultry instead of going without.
I had my small service dog with me and he was such a hit! Some of the cooks came out of the kitchen to greet him and give him a bite to eat and almost all the waitstaff at least said hi to him. He was a happy puppy. :)
There was a little station with small foods in a glass, like a greek salad and a gazpacho soup. There
I didn't even partake of the extensive dessert station (I don't really like sugar anyway) but it would please anyone. There was every type of dessert you could imagine; ice creams, custards, cakes, pies, tarts, fruit, etc. It was an entire extra room full of sugar.

The lamb was too gamey and tasted off in general.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but how would they screw that up.  The tuna ceviche was really bad...I think the fish was bad or something.  The pulled pork on cornbread was ok...the sauce was just so unspectacular, but the corn bread underneath was pretty good.  I didn't try the pizza but it looked no good, and I heard it was no good.

The food was surprisingly disappointing...I tried every fish dish they had to offer (totaling 5) and only enjoyed one of them. The crab legs were not fresh. The sushi was made incorrectly (rice was a mush texture). The lamb dishes were okay. The prime rib was decent but heck how can you really mess that up? 
 
Service: 
Well its a buffet so you wouldn't really expect much service. The waitress took quite a while to get us drinks. She was just not that friendly overall.

Environment: 
This place looks like a $50 per head restaurant. And maybe that's why I expected much more than they provided. The design ranging from plating in the buffet line to table decor is probably the best I've seen at a buffet.

Overall this buffet is good to try for the decor. We paid around $64 per person for the buffet due to tax and included 18% gratuity for a table of 7.
For the price, I think it's a little steep compared to some other places.

The server noted they ran out of some Vitaminwater flavors and offered a different one. They have an Asian section, Italian, Mexican, dessert, and salad section. The egg rolls I got were soft and not very crunchy. 

The Korean pancake is made fresh and I told the cook I was a vegetarian and he went ahead and didn't ask what toppings I wanted. He put vegetables and bean sprouts. I noticed there were wood ear mushrooms available and asked him to add it. He added 1 small piece...

Uh ok?! 

Anyway, it was a bit oily since he added a ladle of oil before then midway he added another ladle. 
My favorites were the tofu and seaweed salads and their lemon zest asparagus. Their truffle mashed potatoes were excellent as well.  The Spanish rice was kind of hard and the pizza looked okay.

The dessert bar looked delicious, but looks are deceiving. The mint chocolate cake tasted like toothpaste. The lemon bars or anything that had a lemon flavor had a egg taste to it. The chocolate cupcakes were super chocolate-y to the point it was like eating fudge. The cheesecake was bland. The spiced muffin was hard as a rock and it didn't have any flavor.

A few items were served in small portions like Caesar buffet, such as fish and chips in small container and street tacos while other stations serve regular portions of food. For dinner, they served roasted chicken, prime rib, lamb, sausages, beef ribs, shrimp, salty crab legs.  Overall the food is average.

This buffet... RUUUUUUUUUULED!!! 

On our last day of our beautiful trip we stopped by for breakfast because the Bellagio one was a little disappointing for me.

I think when people go to Buffets they look for that ""kid in a candy store"" gut reaction that makes their eyes go wide and their hearts run wild. Well I felt that way when we immediately stepped in to the beautiful decor of this place!

Blueberry pancakes, cinnamon whole grain french toast, cute little waffles & tons of toppings! Blintzes and little quiches and frittatas. I adored the individual fruitcups, especially the bright pink, fresh grapfruit with a little mint. They had a BAGEL bar!! and a GRANOLA bar!! with the best fresh toasted pecans *everrrr*. The boy and I hoarded a bunch for the flight - what in the hell were on these pecans? They were so good!

Best of all was the DESSERT room which was assuredly open in its cute little room!!!! One side had tons of breakfast pastries, with some desserts like an amazing vanilla cupcake with strawberry buttercream!!! Sooo good. There were also chocolate covered rice krispee squares! The other side had pies and cake, this awesome peanut butter mouse cake, and a delicious pumpkin spice bar.

They had lunch food out too - mexican (including a vegan burrito), asian foods (like dumplings and such), and some other roasted meat-type products (can you tell I'm veg yet?)

Service was non-stop, and the waitress gave me my coffee to go! I think what also makes this place so great is the simplicity - brightly lit, so all the colors of the food come out. There is a high presence of the cooks every where, constantly bustling. Also the organization is a lot less stressful, and makes for a great experience. 

This place rocked. I am seriously splurging for dinner next time. !!! The other reviews point me only to more of this delicious glory!",0,0,0

My mom and her sisters came to town to enjoy a girls... week out? So the obvious question always pops up. ""Where's the best buffet in town?"" The Wynn of course!

We meet up at the Wynn around 7:30 on a Tuesday night. Personally, my expectations of the food was kind of low since its mid week, compared to the bustling weekends. Don't get me wrong, I've eaten here at least 15 times over the past few years.

The price was $33.95 per person. Easily one of the highest on the strip but wouldn't you pay a few bucks more for better quality? We were thinking about going to PH Spice Market Buffet since it's a good buffet and a few dollars cheaper... But who are we kidding. A few dollars? Cmon now! This is Vegas! A few dollars means nothing.

Here's the interesting part... Right when we were about to walk in, this lady stops us and gives us a pass for a free buffet... The only catch is that you need to sign up for a Red card, which is the Wynn players card. She couldnt use the 2nd pass since she was with her daughter who was not old enough to gamble. That was really nice of her. Since there was no line to the buffet cashier, I ask her if this was legit and how it worked. The super nice cashier told us to go to the Red card booth and fill out an application for a new players card. She also mentioned that if we asked for two free buffets instead of one, they would give us that too... They just dont advertise it. Sweet!

So I sign up for a card as well as my auntie and we both received a free buffet meal. Not bad. We just saved ourselves $70. The only catch is that you have to be a NEW applicant. 

Lets get to the real review... The food. All I can say was WOW. Like I mentioned before, I didn't have high expectations for a mid week 8:30 pm buffet. Boy was I wrong. I think this was one the better meals I've had at this buffet.

My first place included lots and lots of chilled king crab legs. The half shelled crab legs were plentiful and had huge portions of meat on then. I also packed on the jumbo peeled shrimp and some smoked salmon.

My second plate included a rare slice of prime rib, pork dumplings, english sole, caesar salad, and VEAL SHORTRIBS! YUM!!!

For dessert, I had a small bite of a variety of their offerings. Cheesecake, carrot cake, pecan pie, mint chocolate mousse cake, pear mousse cake, creme brulee, and some coconut ice cream.

Bottom line... THIS IS THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!",23,12,17

I spent 3 hours there with 2 friends.  We enjoyed every minute and every plate with rests in between.  The fruit was wonderful.  They had a cheese and cold cut area we didn't have room for.  I did not try the pizza because there were so many other amazing things.  

I overheard one girl complaining she was going to ask for her money back.  Her friend explained she was a vegetarian.  She must have been a really picky eater.  I saw a ton of things she could have enjoyed. 

They change the menu from brunch to dinner at 3:30pm.  I highly recommend coming in the late afternoon so you can enjoy both varieties.  At dinner, they put out these mini salads to die for including one with roasted pears, grapes and candied pecans.  Amazing.

I'll start right away with the one downside--it's price (that's what made it lose that last star). Definitely need to budget it in for all us college students. But trust me, it's worth it.

The crab legs were freaking awesome. Damn. For real--they split the legs in half as well (I have no idea how they did that) so you don't even have to crack them open. The prime rib was really good too--juicy and not over-cooked. The Asian food was alright (the shumai was good, but the pot stickers were barely passable). But damn... those crab legs. And with some drawn butter... damn.

All in all, worth my time. I'll probably go back the next time (assuming I can afford it, which is assuming I don't lose too much at the tables).

There is a lot of meat choices for the carnivores as well. Seafood lovers will also enjoy the ample amounts of crab legs and shrimp. They also had a station for street tacos and Korean pancakes.

The Wynn buffet is a buffet that has lots of variety, quality, and is very clean.  For dinner, they always have roast beef and crab legs.  I'd say the only thing that is you really need to look for is the dessert and fruits.  They always have some great seasonal fruits.  

Last time I went here w\/ my lady friend, we went for lunch and I can say, the quality seems to have gone down.  Maybe I just remember it better than it actually was but it seemed like the quality went down.  

My major complaint is that the servers here are not very attentive.  It sucks even more that they kind of pressure you to leave the tip at the front when you pay for entry.  I can't remember how many times I've been here and waited for 5-10 minutes to get a refill of a drink.

Other items were notable too like the shabu-shabu, (steamed) crab legs, carne asada tacos (with guac, pico, salsa, and lime), and the Brussels sprouts. 

The desserts were pretty disappointing though. The selection was relatively small and that which was offered lacked creativity. The only true bright spot was the butterscotch bread pudding. Definitely get a piece, then get some more.

They had a street tacos section where you could have your own street tacos made. And sooooo much much more!!!!! The desserts looked so appealing that I damn near tried a little bit of everything.

I just couldn't justify giving it a four.  (But, if my husband and his parents were writing this review, I think they all would have given it a generous 4!)  This was the favorite buffet of my husband and his family, but I felt it lacked quality non-seafood choices which dampened my enjoyment because I'm allergic to seafood.

One hint on value....if you go at the end of lunch (before 3:30) it's a lot cheaper, but they begin serving dinner at 4:00.  It got busy close to 3:30, so be sure to get in line leaving yourself a little time to spare.

The other 3 people in our party loved all the seafood and said the crab legs were the freshest they had.  The buffet also had a carving station, mashed potatoes, etc. and a made to order pasta station with pizzas.  I thought the food had some more exotic options and I tend to enjoy more traditional dishes done well.  

The desserts were fabulous and they have a gelato case with an extensive selection of flavors with a variety of toppings to choose from.  The pastry chefs work in open in the dessert area and it was fun to watch them creating.  There are absolutely divine decorated cakes on display that were fun to check out as I wondered around the dessert area.  Dessert was definitely the highlight of my meal.

I would recommend the Wynn buffet if only for the whimsical decor!  The bright colors, fruit and flowers that decorated the restaurant reminded me of Alice in Wonderland brought to life and it was my favorite Vegas restaurant decor.  

Overall, I would recommend the Wynn as worth a visit, especially if you take advantage of the value by being seated at the end of lunch.  Go hungry to get your money's worth!

In checking out the reviews for the Wynn Buffet it seems the thing the people liked most were the Alaskan King Crab Legs.  I had a group of people visiting from out of town and they told me the thing they can't get where they live is great Alaskan King Crab Legs.  I do business with these people and wanted to impress them with a first class joint in Vegas so I decided to take them to the Wynn buffet.  Wow what a disappointing experience we had.  . Can you believe the Wynn buffet doesn't serve Alaskan King Crab Legs.  Apparently they have really been cutting back on the quality there.  A nice couple eating next to us told us they served King Crab Legs up till a month or so ago but have been cutting back on the quality.  Now they just serve snow crab.  If I want unlimited snow crab I can hit any of the cheap buffets in Vegas.  I expected a lot more from the Wynn.  Another guy was complaining they quit serving the lamb chops he loved.  I actually inquired with the manager about why they don't serve Alaskan King Crab Legs anymore.  He complained the price of crab has skyrocketed which is surprising in this bad economy.  I say if more than $40 per person won't cut it then raise the price but don't cut back.  He said his customers don't know the difference between Snow and King.  Maybe some people don't and they are happy but if you understand quality crab there is really no comparison.  Customers being to dumb to know is a bad attitude and just doesn't cut it for a place that is supposed to be high end like the Wynn.  My guests and I won't go back.",4,0,0

A large selection of different foods surrounded by clusters of tables separated by low walls.  We came on a slow Thursday night and were seated immediately.  Most everyone seemed to be stocking up on the snow crab legs.  My husband tried some because these were actually cracked for you, so you didn't have to do major surgery to get at the meat.  I found them watery and bland.  I headed to the sushi, but only managed to eat one piece.  The rice was dry and the California roll filling was stale.  I did love the smoked trout and the ginger pears though.  The bread products were horrible.

This would be my experience for the rest of the meal.  Several bad or mediocre dishes then something very, very good.  In the very, very good category I put the Tandoori chicken and the Basmati rice.  The Tandoori lamb was also very nice.  In the mediocre category I put the Sole and the Roast Beef (tender but bland; watch out for the fiery horseradish).  In the delicious, but odd, category I put the Spanish Gazpacho, which is made with white grapes and is quite sweet.  Adding sliced almonds helps.  In the totally unedible category I put all their desserts.  My husband had a peanut butter cookie that was so hard that I almost had to take a knife to it to cut off I piece.  I shouldn't have bothered as the taste was the same as all the rest of the desserts - sugar, sugar, and more sugar.  Even the chocolate cake barely tasted of chocolate.

I hate to say that I can judge a buffet by their mashed potatoes alone, but these mashed potatoes were not bad, but had only a light fresh potato taste.  Certainly much better than a usual steam table reconstituted mashed potato, but no where near as good as the creamy, buttery mashed potatoes at Cafe Lago.  I'd place this buffet as better than the Mandalay Bay (bad), but not as good as the Paris buffet, the Bellagio Sunday buffet or our favorite, Cafe Lago in Caesar's.",1,0,0

BEST:
-Pancakes + vanilla sweet cream + mixed berry butter. YUM!
-Sausages (Italian; spicy chicken; traditional Italian);
-Flank steak;
-Whipped potatoes;
-Chicken dumplings;
-Pork cutlet (from Italian Station);
-Beet salad;
-Berry-topped cheesecake;
-Creme br√ªl√©e;
-Cobbler;
-Butterscotch bread pudding;
-Strawberry cheesecake ice cream;

CONS\/ Did not enjoy:
-Seafood pasta -- shrimp & over cooked;
-Fried round mozzarella ball;
-WHERE IS THE FRUIT??
-Salmon served in Italian Line was way overcooked;
-Sweet & spicy chicken was gummy\/ squishy (not crisp), and not very flavorful;
-Shrimp was terrible & overcooked in shrimp & cheese grits;
-Rhubarb cobbler-meh.

Front Desk informed me that the buffet was going to stay open until 3:30pm so we stumbled our way through the velvet ropes and entered the Spearmint Rhino of buffets (whatever that is). It was meant to be because we caught our meal just in time as they were switching the dishes, replacing breakfast with lunch\/dinner en trees. Talk about scoring a 2 for 1... It went from:

- Personalized omelet chef, including options of eggs or just egg whites
- Shrimp cocktail, can't have too much, shell fish allergies. But it was fresh, nice and cold, and the size of the shrimp was no Sizzler shrimp.
- Personalized congee sous chef... Congee? I thought I was home for a minute!
- Prime Rib, cooked to near perfection. Take it easy on the Horseradish, it has a good kick.
- sliced bacon, cooked to near perfection
- Eggs Benedict was par.

To:

- Lamb Chop, I might of had 6 of them. If you've got the eclectic pallet, throw in a scoop of mint jelly.
- Rotisserie Chicken, didn't waste my time or money, don't know, it looked great.
- Oven roasted turkey, see Rotisserie Chicken.
- King crab legs, your best bang for the money, it was delish. Melted butter juice was served separately in a cup. I could care less about the shell fish allergy.
- Pork chops
- Omelet station became a ""build your own pasta"" station
- Congee station became a ""build your own noodles"" station
- Chef's Choice - a dish that rotates every 30 minutes or so.  It started off with Mussels but I don't know what came next. I was completely stuffed.

There is not a great selection of anything and yet they charge you like you are going to be feasting on miles of delectable tastes and treats. Once they get you in, it's pure let down and you can begin at the frozen snow crab and room temperature sushi. But hey if your not a fan of seafood that's okay because you can always try the pasta bar, I hope you like penne or rotini because that's all the pasta they have and if you like barley warm sauce that taste like its  from a jar then you're in luck, they can serve you up the best pasta ever! Let's just say my days of making fun of the Olive Garden's fettuccine alfredo are no longer after this experience! If you still haven't found something that looks tasty, then just hit up the tried and true salad bar, because like at any buffet there is always the salad bar where you can make a giant salad and pile on the toppings, except of course here they have even managed to ruin the salad bar! They have the smallest salad bar ever with no selection of anything, which really sucks if your a vegetarian because almost all of the very few options that they do have at this buffet have meat in them! So mashed potatoes and veggie tamales for me it was. What topped off this dismal buffet was our dismal server, not one soda refill and he was nowhere in sight all evening.

The main drawback of this buffet is definitely the wait on the weekends.  I went here last Sunday for lunch with my girlfriend and we waited for probably 1.5 hours.  Another demoralizing thing about the wait is that the Wynn tries to get you to pay an extra $12 more for the ""VIP"" line to skip the regular line.  While I understand the need to generate extra revenue, this has the effect of demoralizing the customers in the normal line.  I won't come back just because of this.  I hope whatever finance or operations guy they have there has done the calculations on excel to justify this attempt at padding their revenues. 

The second big drawback of this buffet is the price.  Sunday lunch was over $30 which is way too expensive for the variety of food they had that day.  While I still think the food is high quality, they didn't have enough expensive items to justify that type of pricing.

I guess it's legitimate to ask the question, is it worth it?  After all, isn't it still a buffet?  I would say this, the quality of the ingredients used in its preparation is far higher than say at the Rio or MGM.  That's not to say those are worse than the Wynn since all of this is subjective.  What I will say is the Wynn does offer a level of precision that one expects from a sit down service.

The one thing The Buffet at the Wynn offers that no other resort can match at this moment is a very good vegan menu.  For vegans out there, the way to eat at The Buffet is to let the server know that you're vegan and what they'll do is in turn inform the Chef who will then come out and walk you through the line.  It's an amazing experience that I believe everyone should experience.  The level of detail the Chef goes into is quite extraordinary.  Unfortunately, I found the food to be a little uneven.  The vegan pizza was definitely subpar in my book.  Perhaps Steve Wynn enjoys his pizza with less cheese, but even as a vegan I expect at least some melted cheese on the dough.  Instead what they had was raw cheese that wasn't melted.  However I did find the artichoke ravioli in a spicy vegan marinara to be quite delicious and flavorful.  The layers of flavors the Chef was able to get out of such a simple item was quite astounding.  The cream if mushroom soup was rather creamy for something missing cream, but what really stood out were the desserts...and more specifically the dark chocolate covered Rice Krispies.  Superb, no way around that.

With that said I go back to the question is it worth $40?  That really depends on what you're looking for.  If you want to eat $40 worth of food, you're probably going to be sick afterwards, but if you to savor items then I do think this is one of those opportunities to treat yourself.  The only downside is you have to pay extra for drinks.  I think at that price point and for such a high volume resort, drinks should be included in the price, but then what do I know.

I don't do buffet much because I prefer having delicately cooked food of my choice, rather than having all-you-can-eat, whatever-they-throw-at-you kind of meal.  However, since we were in Vegas, I was willing to break a few personal guidelines. Like most high-end buffets, I felt like I was paying to much for the quality and quantity I was about to get, so it didn't hurt to have a generous friend on a winning spree on the side.

I was fascinated with the decor inside, usually I don't like extravagance, but if one has to do it, do it right like Wynn. The consistent quality of the food was impressive (of course it wasn't top notch quality, but it was good for a buffet). I was expecting a lot of ups and downs across the room, but I was pleasantly surprised to be proved wrong. The highlight of the meal was of course the snow crab legs that people lined up and fought for like we were at a flea market. I was a little disgusted with the ugly human greed (one guy doesn't need two mountain looking plates of snow crab legs every 15 mins, right?), but then again, it's Vegas.

I found the desert room very cute and entertaining, although the pastries didn't taste as good as they looked. Or maybe it's because, we've all exhausted our senses by then from eating way too much...

Their salads came in small portions in little glass cups, which is good for portion control.  For me, I would rather try a little bit of everything at a buffet, than eat a lot of the few items I like because... it's fun!  And isn't that what a buffet is for? Maybe not.  Still, there were so many unique dishes to try, which is why I mentioned that I would never crave any of them.  After all, how would I crave something I had never even heard of before?  Definitely a great experience.

What makes me love this place even moreeee is their gelato!!  This also comes in small portions too, and while the flavours are pretty intense (mint is super minty, chocolate is super chocolatey rich, etc)... they come in really adorable cups so you don't over eat.

WAhhhhhHHHH i'm hungry now :(",3,3,2

- The sushi bar had only three items.  I don't think this is enough of a variety to have a special section called ""Sushi.""  
- Quality of food was just alright, e.g., grilled pork chops were all either dry or burnt.  The best dish I had was the mashed potatoes. 

The desserts *almost* made everything better.  Everyone's said this before, but I'll speak with emphasis.  The desserts at this buffet are the BEST desserts I have ever had at any buffet.  Each and every dessert was amazing -- the chocolate mousse, cheesecake, bread pudding, carrot cake.  The ice cream, however, was a little extreme in flavor -- the coffee flavor was very strong, and the passion fruit sorbet was very tart.  Overall, desserts were still amazing.

Gotta hand it to the Wynn - they know how much we love our desserts and they do it big.

By 11am., we saw a long line forming and within just a couple of minutes, that line became a 1 hour wait.  Breakfast\/brunch ends at 1pm. ($39.99) and lunch starts at 1pm ($49.99) but do remember that if you don't get your lazy butt down here by 10:30am., you WILL be waiting for at least an hour before getting seated.  I'd never come here for lunch or dinner after seeing the never ending line.   

The decor inside this place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!  Not to mention the buffet kitchen area was just as gorgeous as Scarpetta in beverly hills.  Love the layout.  They pretty much serve everything from Chinese to Italian.  All the different cuisines are separated where you can easily locate and serve the type of food you wish.  

One reason I'd come back here again....THICK SLAB OF BACON!!!!!  O.m.g.  This thing can't be good for your diet but who cares when you're in Vegas!   It's pepper crusted on the outside and maple smoked on the inside.  If you love maple smoked bacon, you'll want this bacon to be the last meal on earth.   

Only reason why I can't give them 5 stars is because I wasn't impressed at all with their dessert station.  Despite the abundance of different types of desserts ranging from macarons to sorbets to cakes to cake pops to mousses and many more sweets, everything was TOO sweet.  Tasted like something from a market.  Basically, low quality.  Even cake mix would taste better than the way they make their desserts.  Very disappointed.  Skip the dessert unless you absolutely LOVE sugar.  

Service is outstanding and everything about the ambience can't be more perfect.  The menu difference between lunch and dinner is crab legs.   Unless you're willing to wait over an hour JUST to eat all you can eat crab legs, you'll be able to eat all the prime ribs and ham for breakfast\/brunch time as well.",12,6,8

Most of the food in Vegas is overpriced and crappy.  This buffet isn't cheap, but the food is far from crappy.  There's a huge selection of delicious dishes, and it's all separated into sections like ""Asian"" or ""Pasta.""  The food all tasted great, and it was presented really well, too.

AND THEN THERE WAS THE DESSERT AREA.  HOLY MOTHER OF CHRIST.  My boyfriend had FIVE miniature flans.  I had ice cream (to die for), miniature creme brulee, 1.5 cupcakes, 1 bite of a rice krispie treat (real estate in my stomach is limited, and I ain't wasting too much of it on a rice crispie treat) and a little bit of chocolate mousse.  It was FANTASTIC.  And yes, I would be a major fattie if I stayed there any longer. 

Gripes:
WTF is up with putting the bread in the dessert area?  I didn't even know it was THERE until I'd already stuffed my first stomach and only had room left in my dessert stomach.  Some of the other stuff was in weird places, too.  Like, why put the cheese in the middle of the seafood section?  Me likey cheese, me no likey shellfish.  I didn't even notice the cheese until I saw my mother with it.  Anyway, it just seemed random to me.

Second, if you show up with 7+ people, they charge you a mandatory 18.75% gratuity.  Now, in most restaurants, I get this.  BUT IT'S A BUFFET.  I AM SERVING MYSELF.  The most you have to do for 7 people is put two damn tables together.  PLEASE.

I have been fortunate to dine in several of there restaurants and cafe.
My boyfriend and I went to the lunch buffet, 2\/5\/13 as one of his events for his bday. He had been to the dinner one about 6 years ago. He absolutely loved which is why we decided to go.
We started with sushi side...one word yuck!. All of the rice was hard. The tuna ceviche was nicely presented but the dish didn't have any flavor.
After the first disappointment we decided to continue to other sections, the Asian, the meats, Pasta, Italian pizza all had the same problem. Something was missing for taste, salt, pepper, love. Again everything looked great but the,taste was not there. On top of that some of the hot food we would get was salad cold by the time we sat. Given we were seated up close and personal and were only going per section so the food was on our plate for no more than a minute before we sat down. 
After courses of disappointments we decided let's get full with desserts, I mean there is no way those good looking desserts must be good. Well think again, we tried tres leches, Madeline, chocolate cake you name it we tried it, again sugar or something was missing. 
Finally we couldn't help it but  complain to the manager. Which than brought out the Executive Chef. Both were friendly, the chef was willing to make anything we wanted how ever we wanted. We would have done it but we were too scare at that point. Than the manager said because we had been there for over an hour it becomes iffy. So they have us free espresso. At that point I just didn't care anymore. So we drank our sorry espresso and went on our way. Still love the Wynn but won't be going to there lunch buffet  ever again.",0,0,0

We were seated immediately at 5PM on a Sunday night (no complaints about that!) and there were plenty of servers to go around, but our server was on the slow side to bring us drinks and clear the table. 

The first thing I go for at any buffet is the carving station - and there aren't too many options here. The prime rib was cooked almost well done (I would have preferred medium rare). There are also an assortment of sausages, which weren't too hot anymore. Chicken looked a bit dry, so I didn't bother. 

The pizza at the Italian section didn't look too appetizing, but the pasta was actually very good! There weren't too many selections at the salad bar, and the sushi at the Japanese station was A-OK (Japanese rice wasn't used, otherwise it was overcooked). 

The best part of the Buffet was the dessert station - so many things to choose from! I saw candy apples, candy pops, various gelato flavors, fatty and non fatty cake varieties, chocolate fondue, cookies and more! If there's any reason to come back, it would be for dessert - but probably not for $40+.

I was a little surprised at this buffet because I thought it would be better, since the overall rating here is 4 stars and they are advertised as one of the best buffets in Vegas. However, I didn't quite agree with that (Especially with a hefty price tag of about $40 a person, I really was expecting a bit more). But let me tell you about my experience right from the beginning to explain myself.
My fiance and I arrived a little before 3:30 pm to catch a very late lunch\/ early dinner (at the dinner prices). We had to wait until the people let us in (although there were people already sitting inside the restaurant, leftover from the lunch time group... oh and by the way, if you want crab legs like my fiance did, they only serve it during dinner and not lunch). My initial impression of this place was how beautiful the decor was and the room we were seated in was nice and bright, which I really like (I don't like to sit in a dark room because it can be a big mood killer and also would like to see what I am eating. I think restaurants often times dim the lights so that you can't see how dirty your water glass is or your silverware). 
After we were seated at our table, I walked around the entire buffet line just to see what was being offered (remember, you won't be able to try everything, so don't even try to kill yourself over and leave the buffet with an achy belly) and I was actually pretty impressed with some of the dishes, like the Indian food selection (loved, loved, loved the baba ganoush and hummus with the pita triangles) and the salad bar selection. But of course there were also some things that I did not care for like the bread station and make your own pasta section, nor the very small and limited sushi bar section. And I am a little disappointed with the dessert section because I've seen other buffets have a bit more. Maybe I just had too high of standards for this place because usually the desserts at any buffet is what I usually go for first (why do I have to wait til the end to have dessert?). But don't get me wrong, I did like some of the desserts though, like the gelato and the madeleine cookies (although I wished it was dipped in chocolate). 
But a few misses with the dessert bar section was the crepe station. It was nice that this buffet even offered this feature, but the choices of toppings and fillings were pretty poor. There were no fruits or cream to fill your crepe. You only had choices of chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup and dried apricots. Those choices to me seem more like toppings and not fillings. I liked that you could get caramel apple pops here and also chocolate covered marshmallows, but the marshmallows were a bit hard and not soft. I was also disappointed with the creme brulee that I got because the sugar used for the top was a bit sweeter than your traditional recipe and the actual cream below the caramelized sugar top was a bit runny. Sadly, this just didn't work for my taste buds. 
I think all in all, if this buffet was maybe $10 or more cheaper, then maybe I would give a higher rating. But at $40, I really don't think it's worth the price and will have to venture onward to another buffet in the sin city.",1,0,0

The first time I was willing to brush off as an off day; this past time, I was really put off, particularly since staying at the Wynn\/Encore lets you cut the line at this buffet, which is a huge draw. Service this past time was, quite frankly, terrible - our waiter wasn't interested in coming by more than once every 30 minutes for more coffee\/mimosas\/water (I got 1 water refill the whole time - HELP ME I'M PARCHED), the hostesses seemed super disgruntled and uninterested in accommodating any requests, and when we tried to flag down other waiters for help refilling things they seemed super uninterested in helping.

The sushi rice was very cold and hard, as is stated many time here.  You'd think they'd fix that.  The seafood crepes were cold, even though they had just been put out.  The lamb meatballs were OK, but wild boar risotto was dry and not well seasoned.

The variety is great, the dishes are somewhat exotic, but they taste and preparation of the food was very very disappointing.

When it was my turn to to pay for breakfast I simply asked the girl if you are a rewards member and or hotel guest is there a discount? She replied ""NO! We don't do discounts"" in a very short and condescending tone. My reason for asking was simply because The party of two before me paid $38 and mine came up to $49... I paid it no mind but as we were walked over from the hostess she overheard me telling my mother how rude the cashier was and instead of addressing my concern she sat us down with a fake smile then whispered something to our server. Now because it was my mothers birthday Today I kept my composure because security would've been called if I would've gave this hefer a piece of my mind.. Anyways onto the food.. The breakfast omelette station was one of my favorites although it was God awful slow it was very tasty! They have one of the biggest selections of food to choose from on the strip!

My tummy jiggles when it knows we're heading to a buffet in Vegas. I love my tummy and I take it to the best buffet in town. Here. 

Wynn buffet is pricey and so pretentious, it's just called ""The Buffet"". That's okay because the food is phenomenal! There's usually a wait line out the door but I got lucky-ish the last time around and only waited 20mins. First time I went, it was over an hour wait! On Fridays and Saturdays, it's 37.95 for their special meats. Mmm... meats!

How to maximize your time and tummy here:

Step 1:
If you have been here before, you head straight to the Alaskan King Crab legs in the Seafood section on either left or right side. If it's your first time, head straight to the Alaskan King Crab legs! Seriously the best tasting leggy meat you'll ever have! Dunk it, dip it, hell just drown it in the butter sauce! If you're already here, healthy is the last thing on your mind. Just savor and enjoy decadence at its finest!

Step 2:
After that, try the other food too! Their Asian aka Sushi\/Chinese food is actually good. Especially the Lotus Blossom leaf wrap. It's sticky rice mixed with other goodies steamed in a lotus blossom leaf. Very tasty!

Step 3: 
Ignore the fruits. It's cheap and you can get the same stuff at home.

Step 4:
Ignore the bread. It's just filler.

Step 5:
Meats. Try everything! Prime Rib. Rack of Lamb. Turkey. Ham. Do it!

Step 6:
Indian\/Middle Eastern section. Oh....almond pita with hummus! (Ignore previous bread statement) The lemon chicken, mmm... Excellent eats!

Step 7:
Any Pasta style you like bar! I had some pesto with pine nuts then marinara with sun-dried tomatoes. So good! 

Step 8: 
Soups & Salads! Good too but not necessary. You're here for quality foods not rabbit pellets!

Step 9: 
Pizza! Mmm... cheesy warm goodness! gourmet toppings!

Step 10: 
Dessert. OMG! They have house made ice cream and sorbets! My eyes rolled back inhaling the coconut, mango and strawberry ones! They have crepes! Mmm.. great with chocolate and strawberries! Lots of mini cakes like carrot cake, chocolate cake, tiramisu, cheese cake and other fancier name cakes. Cookies and muffins too! And flan, creme brulee, eclairs and tarts. Sweet Jesus! 


At this point, your tummy has expanded to the size of Brazil. You should take a couple of deep breaths and push away from the table. Stand up slowly because food coma may have set in already and you could faint. Waddle with care!",12,14,11

1. - The wait is not very long if you are not there at 7 or 8 in the evening...we hit the buffet at about 6:15 and waited less than 10 minutes, and;
2. - I think everything is less picked over and fresher when it's a little less crowded.
OK, it's a buffet, but a really terrific buffet, with cocktails and the whole deal!
The selection is awe inspiring, from the fish to the steaks to the pasta and salads to the dessert, cheeses and everything in between. Really magnificent and the chefs do a great job of preparing everything well and keeping new dishes coming out hot (or cold if required) and on time.

Tons of creative and fresh salads (beet and citrus, red quinoa, roasted cauliflower, kale and butternut squash).

I usually like to look over the options before diving in. The food looked ok...not like what we remembered. I started with a piece of blackened Salmon (super dry no flavor) beef slider (bun was dry, no sauce, meat was so dry you couldn't swallow it), pot sticker (ok) steamed meat bun (bland) spicy tuna hand roll (soggy and not spicy) and a piece of Italian sausage (ok).
Boy, this was not what we remembered...no lamb, the crab legs looked like they were left overs off of a real crab, shrimp looked awful. Street taco station was again just ok. Nothing seemed to have any flavor and most everything was way overcooked. My husband had the prime rib and said that was good..why they get 2 stars not one. The muscles tasted like rubber. They added a Raman station...again completely without flavor. The rest of the selections just plain looked unappetizing and low end.

This buffet was supposed to be up there with Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal, so my expectations were pretty high. I took my family here on a Tuesday for dinner, and arrived at 5 to beat the dinner rush. At this time I'm expecting food to be nice and freshly cooked and ready for the dinner crowd. I was actually shock on the food they are serving. 

Most of the food they have there has surely been sitting for a long time. The meat like Lamb chops, prime rib, Turkey were all pretty hard, chewy, and dried. The rarest you can get the prime rib is between medium to medium well. I love my meat, so it's mostly these that I fill up on instead if carbs. Sad to say, I had 3 bytes if prime rib then it was done. It felt like I was chewing on some very expensive jerky. 
The best meat that they did have was a slab of char siu pork. This was very fatty, but the only great tasting, flavorful, and edible meat that was there. 

For seafood, the cold shrimps are slightly bigger compared to other buffets. Crab legs and oysters are ok, nothing special. Mussels cooked in wine was ok, the two fish dish was hard and chewy, looks like been there for a couple of hours under the heat lamp. 
The mixed seafood scampi was the best I had tonight. It has a nice little kick, and seasoning is perfect. It's pretty sad that I came here to fill up on this and cau co van which was mostly just white beans.

For sweets, they have a pretty good selection. They have the usual sweets, plus a roulette of sorbet, and a made to order crepe station.

Service wise, we were u fortunate enough to have this French guy that looked like he had a long bad day. I was the one trying to compliment him on the nice ambience, but he didn't really care much and just stood at the corner station. It was not that busy yet, but still my iced tea is always empty. I just wanted to go to the kitchen and get the tea myself. He was not very attentive.

Overall, ambience was very nice. Very classy and colorful. Sorry to say that service, and the most important part, the food was very poor.

The decor is spectacular. The hotel is as classy as they come (you can buy a Ferrari for crying out loud). And, the food. My god the food! I've never in my life had such delicious cuisine. 

What I ate:

I started with a salad. It was some kind of kale concoction. I'm not usually a salad man, but this was really quite good. 

After whetting my appetite, I headed to the soup section. I tried the chicken soup which was delectable. 

I then proceeded to the sliced meats area where I picked up some prosciutto. It was pleasant. 

From there I visited the seafood section. I tried some fish which wasn't mind-blowing, but was still perfectly edible. However, I also had a seafood pot-pie which was exceptional. The flaky crust was complimented by a subtle cream sauce that made this dish a favorites for me.

Having tried seafood, I stopped at the Italian area where I tried the cracked egg and ham pizza, and lasagna. Both were to die for. The pizza may not sound appetizing, but believe you me, it is.

From there I continued my gluttonous tour by visiting the sushi\/crab area. I picked up a bit of tempura shrimp and a mound of crab legs. The sushi was merely adequate. But the crab legs were amazing. I could honestly have eaten 2 or 3 more plates full. 

Finally, I discovered the dessert area. I began this stage with an ice cream sandwich. But this was no ordinary ice cream sandwich. The mint chocolate chip gelato (one of many gelatos on offer) was placed between two gourmet chocolate chip cookies that tasted like heaven. 

Next I sampled their creme brulee. It was made to perfection. 

I also had a cream puff, some vanilla gelato, and a bit of carrot cake. All of these were of high quality as well. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. This man couldn't possibly have eaten all that! I assure you that I did. I am 6'3"" with an appetite to match my stature. Honestly, I could have eaten much more, so delicious was the food. But, I didn't want to make any more of a spectacle of myself. 

All in all the experience was phenomenal. As for the reviewers giving negative feedback, I can only surmise that their expectations are completely unrealistic.",3,1,2

Dinner starts at 3:30 pm and is $35.  There's always a line, so when my companions were running late for our 4 pm dinner date, I got in line.  I made it to the cashier in about 20 minutes, but they won't seat you without your full party so I waited off to the side.  The cool thing though is that the rest of your party can then go through the ""express"" lane to catch up with you!  So lucky them (for letting me do all the waiting) and lucky me (for not having to wait even longer to get my grub on)!

This buffet was AMAZING.  Could you get better food elsewhere?  Yes.  But the point is that for buffet fare, the food here exceeds.

We dined for a couple of hours and there was still so much more I didn't get to try.  I made a beeline for the prime rib (great) and then stood in line for the shrimp cocktail and crab legs (yummers).  These are the cornerstones of buffet dining so lay off those fillers (you know who you are mashed potato guy)!  I also sampled some bites from my friend's plate.  The herb crusted salmon with dashi mushroom in a carrot miso broth was fantastic, as was the sea bass with cabbage, bacon and fingerling potatoes in a red wine sauce.  It's surprising when fish is good at a buffet where the food is bound to sit under heat lamps or on heated trays.  Also good was the grilled asparagus.

The dessert area made me wish I had a tapeworm.  So many choices (including a waffle and crepe station!) and such beautiful presentation.  I went with chocolate and vanilla ice cream (excellent) and an Oreo mousse cake (sadly it sounds better than it tastes).

The sushi section (I skipped it) looks weak with only three offerings, but otherwise most buffet sections looked impressive like the salad juice glasses, the five kinds of ceviche and the charcuterie (I didn't like the prosciutto though) and cheese (love the gouda)!

so we got to the 2 tables, i was looking around and there were plenty of available tables around us that can accommodate all 8 of us.  i asked the hostess seating us if we can move to those big tables she replied no and that we have to have 2 tables of 4 people. my family is from a small town in Lake Tahoe and they were just happy to be there, we all sat down, the waiter took our drinks and we headed to the buffet line.  as i was walking back i asked our waiter why we cant seat at the bigger tables, he answered - ""BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PAY THE 18% GRATUITY"".  at that point, i was overcome with anger and i was just thinking, first of all, no one told us about that, second it was $50 and it was no problem to pay it specially if its a difference of having a sit down dinner with family.  i went back to the host, asked her if that was the case that's why we were sat separate, she said yes, she called the manager and so i told the manager all about it.  i told him exactly that i am staying at the hotel, im having my family over that i have not seen in a year and i wanted a table for all of us to be together.  he ushered us to the bigger table, and about 10 minutes later, he came back to the table and handed me a slip\/receipt for $50+ for the 18% gratuity we needed to pay. . i paid it but at that point i was very angry and disappointed that i did not even want to eat.  it was just a horrible experience.",1,2,0

The desserts were very beautiful.  A lot of different mouse choices.  Intricate and tasty with unique flavors and names.  One of them was pistachio and peach.  Tiramisu was wonderful!  Their ice cream was very good too.

EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!

Never going to eat here again and never going to recommend anyone I know to eat here. 

Initially, the price you pay ($47.00 for 2) didn't seem too bad. You expect it to be that price. It's a buffet right? When you take your first lap around the buffet you'll notice how dismal the selections are. There's breakfast cereal... BREAKFAST CEREAL!!! I just paid $23 to have fruit loops?!? Then that's when you realize the price is ridiculous. 

If you continue on you'll notice each station has some sort of an egg dish. Lobster frittata, scrambled eggs, egg white only, eggs benedict, and then an omelet station?!? Who can eat so many eggs and how lazy do you have to be that you can't come up with any other dish other than plain egg whites?!?

After bypassing the numerous egg dishes and the prepared cereal bowls of frosted flakes and fruit loops, I went looking for the lox and bagels. I find the station and a line of people thinking that maybe the lox are really good. I remember them being pretty good so I make my way over to the line. I get to the line only to find that people are waiting for the staff to put more lox out. The woman in front of me says that she's been back and forth from her table several times hoping that they had replaced the lox. She went on to say she's been waiting for at least 40 minutes. 40 MINUTES!!! We ask the man behind the glass to put more out and all he says is ""more coming."" Yes we know, but WHEN?!?

I do a walk-by of all the food and get really excited by the sheer quantity of items at my disposal and how tasty everything looks.
 
I grab a plate and start putting food on it. But as I move down the line (and get a closer look at everything), I start to realize how unappetizing most of the dishes actually look.
 
Finally, I walk back to my table and start eating. And this is when it's confirmed: the food, simply put, is not very good.
 
The Buffet at Wynn was no different. Despite my previous review stating I would never return, I agreed to one more try since my wife loves their buffet. But now, I really am not going back. As I said before, I'd rather take my money and eat at a nice sit-down restaurant.
 
Having said that, I'll just do a brief run-down of my thoughts on the food here based on my last trip. Some things were too salty (e.g. Kalbi sauce wings, Chicken and jalapeno sausage), while others were too bland (e.g. Steak and egg pizza, Prime rib), or felt\/tasted old from having sat out for a period of time (e.g. Spicy salmon hand roll, Seafood crepe). My favorite dish of the night was the Lamb meatball - it had just the right amount of seasoning on it.
 
I'm not trying to bash this buffet (or most of the others out there)... I know the food can only be so good when you're making this much of it. But for me personally, it's just not my thing.

On the downside, the crab legs had no taste whatsoever. They were split open for ease of eating and they were continually well stocked since this was a popular item. I tried the prime rib and it was very good, but dry without au jus. The sushi was just average. The salads were good. The sea bass was just average in my opinion. The shrimp was very good--firm and fresh. Cocktail sauce has some kick!

The wife got lamb and loved it, and lamb stew and said it was very good.
She also tried the spiced lentils and curried chicken.

Overall, the selection is excellent and the quality is high. I appreciate how difficult it is to serve high quality food on a buffet line.

Ok so the food was really good for a buffet, it all tasted fresh and yummy. There was a lot to choose from. My one complaint was the salad bar. Which is why I did not give it five stars. There was not enough choices at the salad bar. I was kinda shocked at how little they had to offer to make a killer salad.

This place is no exception, especially when the food is good.

They had sea bass(king bass?) and I really liked the flavor the made it.  It wasn't over cooked and mushy, nor was it dried out and chewy.  The texture was just right and I really loved it.  

The smoked salmon was average though, I guess I expected a little more, but it definitely tastes like your average store-bought smoked salmon.

There wasn't lobster the times that I went, but I heard they have it on occasion.  They had snow crab legs however and it was thoughtfully sliced open so the meat is easily accessible.  Since it's a more upscale-ish buffet, you don't have to be pigging at the crab legs for meat, convenient.  

Dessert?  CREME BRULEE!  They have little dishes of creme brulee.  I mean granted they weren't the best things ever, but creme brulee as a dessert is always a plus.  They also have a variety of ice creams, crepes, cakes, cookies, etc.  Loved it.

The buffet averages about $40 a person if you go with an average sized party.   But I think if it's a party more than..6 or 8, the have mandatory gratuity and all that good stuff, so it comes up to be about $50 a person.  So, if you have a huge party and don't really want to be spending $50 for a buffet, I'd say split up.  You'll be getting up and walking around for food anyway, you'll see your friends, don't worry.  

Personally I'd head over to the Bellagio for a buffet, they cost a little less, and for some reason I still like the Bellagio buffet better.  The Wynn Buffet is just newer and pretty. 

Good buffet place though, I've been there a few times.  Just for the creme brulee dessert afterwards :D",0,0,0

Underwater automobile companies.  Wall Street tycoons.  Quantity.  Did I say quantity?  Quantity.  Remind you of anything?  The American dream, folks.  And what better way to celebrate these ideals than to eat at a buffet.

I'm not a big fan of buffets... I much prefer quality over quantity.  The Wynn is, however, considered to be one of the best buffets in Vegas, so we figured we'd give it a shot.

The selection is amazing, and the dishes are pretty creative for a buffet.  The things that I remember eating:
-pizza -- thin slices, greasy, pepperoni was bad.  Why waste the space in that belly, honestly.
-veal shortribs -- fatty but melt in your mouth, pretty tasty, these were probably the best thing that I had.
-lamb oso bucco -- tasty and tender, but there was a certain artificial flavor to it.
-lamb chops -- I love lamb chops, one of my all time fave dishes, but the meat quality was quite mediocre.
-tandoori bass -- I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but this was absolutely the most disgusting tandoori dish I have ever tasted in my life. bleh barf burp baaaaarf
-prime rib -- was pretty tasty and properly cooked, nice and juicy, but again lacking that certain something in the flavor and tasted somewhat artificial (of course, come on, it's Vegas right???).  The creamy horseradish was unpalatable to say the least.
-smoked salmon -- along with the veal shortrib, this was the highlight of the meal.  Not the best I've had by any stretch, but it was tasty and well executed.
-shrimp -- well, they were shrimp.  With cocktail sauce.  Nuff said.
-king crab legs -- I've never seen so many crab legs in one place at one time.  They brought in barrels (literally) to stock the buffet.  They were good, because they were crab (and I love crab), but the legs were incredibly salty, too much so for my taste.  But hey, dip them in butter, and I'll keep rolling.  Meh, overhyped.

Then came time for the famed dessert buffet.  Wow, so many options, I don't even know where to start... so I grabbed a little bit of everything, you know how I roll ;)  Nothing was very good though... they were okay, but I didn't actually finish anything because it wasn't worth the calories.  Lemon mousse with meringue, chocolate chip cookie, bread pudding, peach pie... all were meh.  Some chocolate thing that my gf grabbed was pretty decent, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate so that didn't sell me.  The worst thing was the candied apple -- the glaze was so thick that it was like an apple dipped in a jolly rancher... time to break some teeth.  No thanks...

If you think that this is a negative review, a) you should read some of my other reviews, and b) it's not.  It's an A-OK review.  My standards were lowered because it was a buffet, and therefore I'm going 3 stars... if this was a regular restaurant, they would have received a lower rating.  If you're going to eat at a buffet, this is about as good as it gets, but if I'm going to spend $40+ per person then I can think of quite a few other options where I would prefer to dine (even in Vegas).",8,6,7

I can't recall the last time that I visited a buffet, but it's probably been at least 10 years. 

I have to knock a star for the pricing model. The price is adjusted with the demand and it's not really set. We visited just after Christmas and it seems that they applied the special rates even though Christmas was over. Also, I think it's horrible that they don't offer child pricing. We brought an 11 year old that doesn't have the biggest appetite so it's unfair that they charge the same rate for him as they do for a middle aged man chopping at the bit for shrimp and prime rib.  

The food was pretty tasty, but the fruit could have used more variety. However, the desserts are exquisite in presentation but half that I sampled were lacking in flavor and were dry. The chocolate and vanilla malted milk ice cream was one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted.

The only thing underwhelming was the salads but you aren't there to eat lightly so this wasn't a big deal. Service was also quite attentive and kept our glasses full.

--Blue Corn Pancakes: Probably the least popular since it's in stiff competition with red velvet, blueberry, and buttermilk... but it was amazing! It goes well with any type of sweet syrup, but I went for vanilla creme, topped with toasted almonds. So good!

--Smoked Salmon: Layer that baby up with some finely diced red onions and dollop it with sour cream! I guess you're supposed to dollop with some cream cheese, but I wanted a less dense of a spread. 

--Healthy Green Juice: I'm sure it was kale-based. Loved it!

First, the price. It's gone UP! And I didn't notice a significant change to accompany this increase. If I remember correctly, The Buffet used to be priced around $30-35 a few years ago. Last night (Friday night) we were charged $49.99 per adult, and $24.99 per child (3 years and up). WOW... Bachannal really made the influence on the rest of The Strip with their pricing I guess!

Second, the first impression. It was fine... But a few things. They wanted to dump us off on a table very far from the action. We asked to be seated closer to the food were told that it could take ""a while,"" so we sat. Turns out ""a while"" was just two minutes. When we were seated, our hostess said, ""please enjoy your two hour dinning experience!"" Wow... that seemed pretty tacky. I've never heard of a time limit at any of the Vegas buffets and it just seemed a little passive aggressive. Seems like a sign at the register or quick mention before being seated would have been less tacky.

Okay... the food. GOOD FOOD. As usual, there's lots of fillers and range from bleh to great, so I won't go into those. It's the main items I was interested in: meat and seafood. The prime rib was cooked medium-well to well... above my taste preference. But since it was nice and tender, and I drizzled some au-jus, it was good. (Quick note, you can have them sear the prime rib on the grill if you like it that way!) They had a fancy ribeye that was the opposite, it was rare... so a under what I prefer. (I'm not the only one that thinks medium-rare is the perfect way to enjoy steak, right?) It was good though... great flavor! Then came the BBQ beef rib... and let me tell you, I love my BBQ beef ribs. If you've been to Lucille's and had their BBQ beef ribs, that's what I was hoping for. But no, a resounding no. This thing was dry rubbed with sauce on the side, which is fine... but it was DRY DRY DRY. Felt like it had been under the heat lamps since lunch. I sadly could only eat two bites of that. I didn't bother with the roasted turkey but since I'm a sucker for fried chicken, I had to try a piece and it was good, tender juicy inside and good crispy batter on the outside. As for the seafood, cocktail shrimp is hard to mess up... that was amazing as usual. And crab legs were great! I ate WAAAY too many crab legs dipped in drawn butter. Not a big sushi eater, but it looked good. The sides are all hit and miss, usually because of taste preference. The shrimp hargow was gross, sadly... but there was a crispy fried flat shrimp eggroll that was good. Mashed potatoes, corn... soups, etc.

Dessert. You could come just for the dessert and it would almost be worth it (at their previously lower prices!). Creme brulee was awesome as usual. Then I chose to get a crepe, fill it with apple filling, cream, vanilla bean ice cream, and then topped with vanilla and chocolate sauces... I was completely full, but had to keep eating because of this.

Overall, I was hoping for a bit more... Maybe it was the extra traffic on the I-15 from LA making me hungrier... but I have fonder memories of The Buffet. I think for now, I'm going to say the Bellagio Buffet would probably be a better value.",0,0,0

For $20 a pop, I wanted either to have my tastebuds totally blown away or at least a wider assortment  of dishes. I was looking for more of ""the good stuff"" like crab legs or shrimp or even a crab cake, that you'd think you'd find at fancier brunch buffet, but I guess those are reserved for the dinner service.

The omelet guy was the highlight. I always make a beeline for the omelet guy. The jalapeno eggs benedict was pretty tasty, too, --- though it was kinda cold and the egg rather tough, like it had been sitting for a little bit. Everything else was good -- the pastries, the bacon, et al. 

There was an inordinate amount of Asian and Indian cuisine for a brunch and I wasn't sure why. I have no problem with either of those fares -- all tasty and good -- but it wasn't what I was seeking in brunch. There was a lot of cold squid and mystery fish sauces and things of that nature. So if you're from those places or are just really into a more exotic 11am menu, you might be into this buffet. I skipped most of those things for... well, let's not kid ourselves... more bacon.

Our cashier never asked if we wanted mimosas or champagne or anything, but our server added it on for us at the table without issue (thanks very nice server whose name I can't recall!)

We only really came here because we had a friend who had never been to Vegas before and wanted to take him to a higher-end Vegas buffet experience, and while everything was good, it just didn't make me all that excited to return or in a hurry to recommend it.

First, we went on a thursday night at 6:30 - no wait, lots of empty tables.  After reading the reviews, i thought i'd be there forever waiting but on weekdays it's obviously not that bad.  Weekends maybe but weekdays, not bad.  Also, on weekdays, it's only $32. Weekends $35.

The food was alright.  The highlights are the Alaskan crab legs, lamb T-bone steak, and prime rib.  I'm not a big foodie but my friends wanted to go but to me, crab legs are crab legs anywhere you eat them.  They must have been frozen for them to saw it in half so cleanly.
Same for prime rib...it was cooked to perfection but no special marinating or anything...taste like prime rib we make at home.  The lamb i thought was the best where there was actually some culinary skills involved.
There were alot of other varieties, like asian and italian stuff but who is going to eat fried rice and pasta or meat balls at an upscale buffet (oxymoron??)  I did have some mash potatoes and my favorie strangely was their sweet potatoe with cinnamon...good comfort food.  I tried not to eat alot of it to save room but the taste is very satisfying.

Great service, very clean, patrons very orderly, the decor was fine.  I somehow thought the seating would be a bit more snazzy but it's comfortable and fine - casual is good way to put it.

So save room for their desserts...kudos for that.

I tend to agree that the quality of food was far superb to the likes of Golden Corral (sorry Wynn to even mention the two in the same review)

Service was fast even though it was always busy when we ate there (had like 6 free prepaid buffets)

Snow crab, Shrimp, dungeness crab claws, rib eyes, prime rib, bacon smoked hams, on and on for only $45 a person on Friday night

Breakfasts were $25 per buffet and scrumptious

With so many reviews for this buffet I thought it would have beat the Cosmo ""wicked spoon buffet"" but I was wrong.  Wicked spoon is way better than Wynn buffet.  


Wynn was smart to start dinner at 1pm instead of 3pm on a regular day but because it was a holiday they switched it up to 1pm.  


We've tried to eat our money's worth but there wasn't that many selection of food.  The main courses were PRIME RIBS- (not my type of red meat) and ALASKAN CRAB LEGS.  Everything else is just the usual food but nothing to keep going back for.


The food here was okay   Desserts here were very limited selection.  Not as good as Cosmo's desserts (they have tons.)   I've tried their candied apple but there was no way I could bite into it because it was hard like a rock!!  That idea is a waste because the outside shell is hard and people would just throw it a way in end.   They had a crepe station but that wasn't good either.

Anyways they have Seafood daily (not just on weekends)  they had crab legs...really really good shrimp cocktail (not just weeny ones)
they had mussels, all sorts of fish, chicken, prime steak, sushi and even handrolls!!  They have hummus and fresh baked pita bread which i adored!  they have baba ganoush.  They have several soups and the chciken noodle is delicious (everything house made) 
They have veggies...and also the dessert area is fantastic...mini cupcakes, cheescake, key lime, tiramisu, lots o cookies, even candied apples!  Also there are several ice cream flavors you can choose from that are behind a glass case just as if youre in an ice cream shop.  you just pick and they can put toppings...much cooler than just a typical soft serve machine.

I watched Le Reve in the Wynn Theater.
The theater is fantastic as well...the tiered seating makes it so no matter where your seat is you have a great view of the entire stage and what's going on.  Very well done! The stage is a circular built one in the center and seriously you can see everything and have no one's head in your way.  =)
the show was very creative and enjoyable.  I think the Le Reve show holds more or a story than Cirque De Soleil.
I definetely give all the performers props for what theyre doing performing in or with water takes lots of work!  *I was lucky enough to get discounted tickets (Military can get up to 50%)
If the tickets were full price $138.50 then I probably would not have felt it worth that much.  The show was just a little over an hour long but did include a lot, different acts and what not.  The music\/singing was live and I could see the singer in the small booth, that was cool.

Instead, this buffet is more like a cheap knock off than a formidable competitor. The seafood quality is nowhere near the expected value of the dining price, and the food was generally uninteresting and overcooked.

For those who hasn't venture to try your luck at this cliche and adventure filled place, you are missing out. Just imagine people from all around the world, here to find their own adventure all compacted into one crazy section of the Las Vegas Boulevard. There are shows out your wazoo. There is shopping where ever you turn you head to. There are bars themed bars that will sell you a 40 OZ replica guitar filled with margarita or any common alcoholic frozen drink of your poison. Pretty much you can reenact the Hangover movie experience, or go have a bacherlorette groupie and do what ever your what and even a guy's weekend to do anything you desire. It is true that what ever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, except your money and a credit card bill when you return home of course. When you go, just go ahead and budget to spend without too much worries. You only live once.

So, one of my quest in Vegas was to find This buffet that everyone keeps talking about. I wanted to see what the hype was about since it was even located at The Wynn Hotel.

When you walk into the entrance of the buffet, you can notice a whole lot of flower arrangements and butterfly tiles. The owner of the place, Steve Wynn (one of the richest man in the world, by the way) apparently is Buddhist and lives the way of circle which explains a lot about the decor and red and a whole lot of butterflies. I was told by my pals in Philly that the seafood side was pretty good for a buffet. So, I rushed to that side immediately after I ordered my drink. Behold, a mound of giant king crab legs sliced in half to help the eater easily extract the meat without any difficulty. They make it so easy for you. The jumbo cocktail shrimps are mostly peeled and the butter is dispense into a mini bowl. The only thing missing that would have made it extremely effortless to eat my seafood platter I made was that they should have had a lemon juice dispenser. They had prime rib there. They had everything you would see at a thanksgiving supper like whole turkey carved. They had Sushi hand rolls, Sashimi, clam chowder with real claims and chunks of chicken, chicken noodle like mama intended it to be like, Chinese take out style gourmet foods, and everything you would look for in a buffets.

My only complaint at the place was that I though the desserts weren't so great compared to other places I have been to. I mean they have a decent Gelato stand, but the cakes and everything else was so disappointing. Their french crepes were small and too powdery. They need to make it bigger like the Paris Hotel's Buffet. They also should serve creme brulee with less caramelized sugar on top and they should use a smaller torch. This is not shop class meets cooking. It certainly was not as good as it should be. I would not recommend their creme brulee because it seemed rushed and poorly prepared. The fruits tasted like water. I mean everything looked great, almost like a piece of art. I would say, stick with the ice cream and the food there at this buffet, and your experience would be satisfying enough.

For a 40$ buffet, it's a okay. Just would not be a repeat for me since there are tons of food places I need to try out in Las Vegas since you have to drop at least 40$ for the good buffet at dinner time.",0,0,0

Everyone says that Bacchanal is the best BY FAR, but I don't know how much I agree with that. The Buffet at Wynn puts up a good fight and for a much more decent price. I always go half an hour to an hour before the lunch price ends to make sure I can get the lunch price but still enjoy the dinner items :) 
Lunch price for Wynn: $29
Lunch price for Bacchanal: $40

I don't know if I really think Bacchanal is that much better than Wynn honestly. I think maybe overall, every dish at Bacchanal might be a bit better than Wynn's, but I'd be perfectly happy with Wynn's food especially for ~$10 less! They both have the crab legs that are cut in half and also oysters on the shell, which, let's be real, is what most people come for!!

Things I liked better at Bacchanal:
- Tacos: better flavor in the meat
- Shrimp and grits: creamier and more flavorful
- Fried chicken & waffles: fried chicken was perfectly fried and chicken was so tender!!
- Meat cuts (tri-tip, steak, ribs, sausage, etc.)
- Pecan tart: SO GOOD.

Things I liked better at Wynn:
- Peking duck buns: I was so excited to see that they had this!! I think it's a little misleading that they call it peking duck buns since traditionally, peking duck's main focus is the crispy skin, but the ones they serve at the Wynn have little to no skin at all and it's also not crispy. Regardless, it was pretty good for a normal duck bun!
- Made-to-order LATKES: they have preset ones that you can order and the worker will make it right in front of you! I usually don't finish these kinds of things 100% but I actually did finish my whole latke! 
- Ahi tuna poke: although they only give 3 pieces of fish in this dish, they're really big cubes! I thought the sauce it was dressed with was better than Bacchanal too. 
- Ice cream: I liked the flavors here better and I thought it was creamier. I really liked the lychee one!
- Chocolate lava cake: warm and ooey gooey on the inside! At Bacchanal they don't really have the lava inside :(
- Panna cotta: the one at Bacchanal was a bit too tart for me. The one at Wynn is guava and it's perfect!
- Vegan chocolate chip cookies: you can't even tell they're vegan! So good!!

As a bonus, when you walk in it's absolutely beautiful!! They also have bathrooms inside the buffet (Bacchanal doesn't). Also, our server was SO ON POINT with taking away our dishes and topping off our drinks! At Bacchanal, they took away dishes relatively often, but it was impossible to get our drinks refilled :(

Well, now days I would never do Taco Bell, and would pass on most buffets.  But how can one pass on The Wynn's celebrated buffet?  

Having an early flight to Vegas and a few hours to kill before checking into our room at Caesar's, we tried the brunch buffet at the Wynn.  The price was $18.95 plus tax on a Friday morning, and the wait was minimal.  Like most Vegas buffets, there were many choices from all the basic breakfast foods, omelet station, Mexican, Asian, Italian, salads, pastries, etc.

I won't go into detail since this place has nearly a thousand reviews, but my favorite items would be the ceviche, pot stickers and pastries.  Apparently, there is a big debate about which buffet is better, the Wynn or Bellagio. We tried the Bellagio the next day and found the Wynn slightly better, but similar enough that you can't really go wrong with either one.

I wanted to go to Boiling Crab, but I didn't want to put up with the huge wait. Instead, I held off till I took my trip to Vegas to get a chance to gorge myself with the all-you-can-stuff-your-pig-fat-face-fat-ass-stretchy-pants-self buffet.

I was about to hit up the Seafood buffet at the Rio, but since we were staying at the Palaaaazzo (say it in a Mario and Luigi Italian accent) across the way, I decided on the Wynn instead. Plus, imagine all the exercise involved going from the Palazzo to the Rio.... I'm out of breath writing about it. So I decided on the Wynn instead, and for $46 U.S. dollars I got to eat Alaskan King crab that was conveniently split into two (very smart on the managements part because hopefully it cuts down on waste). Also most patrons will have stubby butter coated pig like stubs that would make it difficult to efficiently crack each crab leg to extract the meat.

The crab was alright, and somehow I got sick of it. Possibly because I was trying to eat 3lbs to ""get my money's worth"", so I decided to try out the rest of the food because I assumed that the Wynn was going to be better than the Bellagio buffet, but it's almost identical. Comparing the two directly, I'd probably go for the Bellagio buffet over the Wynn because it seems as though they do some things a little better than the Wynn (desserts and selection). 

The gripes I have - FYI, I always have them, that's why it's a joy eating with me: 

1. Seriously why is it always steamed crab or steamed shrimp, and why only f'n cocktail sauce and butter!??!
2. The prime rib sucked. Crappy, tough, and dry. Au jus couldn't save it.
3.  Every meat here was overcooked, and spent a little too much time under the heat lamp. 
4. Can't they mix-up the menu a little?? Does it have to be along the same lines as every other buffet on the strip??
5. The lobster bisque was the most rancid nastiest bisque I've ever had. I hate to waste, but this was destined for the trash.
6. One other gripe in general that I have: I can't stand waste, and people waste at buffets because they forget that chicken, beef, fish, etc does come from a living animal. I think if you had to slaughter an animal, you'd be less prone to waste food. 

I don't normally eat at the hotels, and instead I venture off the strip for most of my meals which isn't necessarily better, but with the type of food I had at the Wynn, I'd rather spend my time on Spring Mountain Rd..... with the locals in their stretchy pants.",13,13,10

      We came for brunch shortly before noon.  Waited in line about 45 minutes.  It was $35.50 approx, per person, without alcohol service. The decor is bright and cheerful with a lot of sunlight coming through.  Everything was beautiful and clean.
      My first plate was dim sum and shrimp cocktail.  I was mmmming and yumming it up.  the reason I came here was because they say there are a lot of vegetarian options, and I found that to be reasonably true but there are definitely more options for meat eaters.  I usually try to only eat plant-based food but I made an exception here, eating fish, cheese and eggs for a change.  The quiche was like bouncy rubber, so I can't say I recommend it.  I tried the polenta and the grits and they were OK.  But I loved my creation of a slice of cheese pizza with a topping of smoked salmon from another part of the buffet.  Good idea, me!

This is more like a dining experience, rather than a buffet.  It was so fun!  The dining area is gorgeous and very classy.

One thing that really stood out to me about this buffet is that they know, I mean really know, how to make ethnic foods!  What a nice treat.  Their pork buns and steamed dumplings (served in the bamboo steamers) were authentic!  They had an array of Indian food as well, and it was very good.  Their sushi wasn't very good, but the smoked salmon and mahi mahi was great!  There were a number of salads pre-made and there was fresh fruit and great cheese in it!  So tasty!  

Everything was very good and above the usual norm for an all-you-can-eat place but the dessert area took the cake (hah!).  Homemade gelato and ice cream, cakes, cookies, and everything in between!  It was all delicious.  Plus, there were a number of sugar free items for those keeping an eye out for those or parents wanting to limit sugar intake for their kiddies.  And, their desserts also have little signs to let you know if they are gluten free or if they have nuts in them-- also good for those with special dietary needs in mind.

Basically, if you are going to go to a buffet in Las Vegas, do it right, spend the extra couple of dollars and go to the Wynn.  You will not be disappointed, you won't leave feeling sick unless it's from overeating, and you won't feel like you wasted time or money on a meal.",0,0,0

This is definitely the best buffet I've been to in Las Vegas. It's also pretty expensive in light of the new deal in town with access to about seven or eight buffets in 24 hours for $45-$49 per person. 

I love the entrance, which is bright, playful, and very cheery. At first you think the decor is too quirky and weird, but there is a design behind the pretty madness, and it's very endearing. 

Service is lacking, since our lackluster server was not very attentive and did not refill our drinks more than once.

- Sweet pea risotto (Yes! Risotto at a buffet!)
- Seafood pot pie
- Halved king crab legs 
- Caesar salad
- Pasta (I'm not sure what it was -- maybe carbonara? But I've tried all the pasta dishes, and they were all delicious)

I went and stood in line at 3:10 and got to the cashier at 3:20. I ended up paying the $26 lunch price. After that, we went to seat down, and viola 3:30 came around and they brought out all the premium dinner food like prime ribs and crab legs. By the way, dinner on Friday is $41, so I saved $16 and get to eat the good food.


I had an opportunity to eat at Wynn for the 2nd times in 2 years. The food has gotten a lot better then previous years. 

There were a wide variety of food to choose from. I believe the food are way much better when it's served on Friday to Sunday.

They now have street tacos, last time I ate here, they didn't have this.

I wish they had King crab legs like at Bellagio buffet and Aria buffet. They only serve snow crab legs instead. 

Dessert station was OK not that impressive like Ceasars Palace buffet. They do have candy apple.

Overall the food was pretty good.",3,1,1

I'm not really a fan of the d√©cor though. Not really digging the pastel colors. I also didn't like the fact that they tried to split our party of 12 up. We went on a Sunday night, so it wasn't as busy. At first, they tried to sit 8 of us at two tables of 4 that were next to each other and then the last 4 would be sat at another table far away from the other 8. So we complained and thank goodness another table for 4 opened up next to the other 8. Otherwise, I would have been really upset.

There is sooo much to choose from here: King crab legs, shrimp cocktail, seabass, salmon, prime rib, lamb, shortribs, Chinese food (chow mein, dim sum, pot stickers), Indian food (naan and curry), bruschetta station (tomato & basil, mushroom, eggplant, etc.), cheese and cold meats, pasta station, pizza, soups, salads, sushi, desserts (pumpkin pie, cheesecake, chocolate cake, candy apple, fruit, warm brownie, Madeleine cookies, etc.). 

My personal favorites were the king crab legs (cut in half so that it is easy to get to the meat), shrimp, seabass, and pastas. The place that I thought lacked the most was the desserts. 

My go-to buffets are still the Wynn and Bellagio.",2,0,1

This place has good reviews and friends said it was good so we decided to try it. Came at 1pm on a Saturday and got sat about 2pm. The wait was brutal but expected.. It was about $100 for two people including drinks so pretty average. The food selection was horrible.. Old stale pizza, nasty chicken, old Asian food.. Pretty much everything was old. I'm eating with 3 people who all hate their food as well. Even buffets with shitty food are usually ok in some ways but this place has nothing good to offer. The food doesn't even look appetizing to start with. The only thing that looks decent is the desserts but I haven't tried them just yet so 2 stars for that.

Con: angry yet useful waiters, possible long lines with seafood. 

This the Mecca of all buffets, the one that we planned the whole CES trip around, what to eat before hand for a few days, what to eat that morning, and what to calm ourselves down afterward. Yes, I know it is a bit insane, but when you are serious with good food, you plan your attack. 1st tip, go into the buffet before 3:30 pm to get the lunch rate and stay for the dinner. 

The decor is flowery with a lot of bright corners flooded by the ceiling lights, good to spot water on the marble floors at the serving tables. Take a quick tour of all the available food first, this buffet is about twice as big as Mandalay bar, three times as big as the state line hotels, know what is around first will be very important. 2nd tip, carb and meaty protein first, then cultural sidedish and seafood, then finish with light salad and desert. 

Try to avoid the crazy Asian dinner crowd, they are the locust that destroyed the crops in Egypt. If there are 20 Asians waiting on the crabs and shrimp, don't bother to check it out for at least 30 minutes, for they will just wipe out everything without any consideration to other patrons. This goes back to getting there early, that way you won't get stormed like Anita did (hail!) 3rd tip, take a break, this is a marathon, not a sprint. 

The desert could be a death trips for kids, since they tend to swarm the usual fare - cookies and ice cream. If I have to make one suggestion to the buffet, it would the cookies. Those things are hard enough to cut glass, I had drown a chocolate chip in a glass of milk for 2 minutes (clocked it) and it still came up hard. Forget using a brick to smash windows, use a Wynn buffet cookie. Target the creme brulee and the fruity cakes (pumpkin spice). 4th tip - don't go crazy on one single desert, your table will be cut off (15 creme brulee by us in 10 minutes). 

Good luck and may the force be with you. :)",3,7,4

The first place I thought of without any hesitation was the Wynn. I have been here many times before and a revisit was in order.

I will come out and say it, this buffet is pricey. It actually had jumped about $10 for breakfast since the summer and from looking at other yelp reviews, it jumped $2 in the past two weeks. Its about $36 for each person which is definitely on the expensive end for breakfast, but the food is definitely worth it. You can immediately tell the difference in the time and care that was put into making the food. Everything looks and tastes freshly prepared and it wasn't just zapped in a microwave to cut some corners.

I ended up getting a couple of eggs benedict, smoked salmon, bacon and sausage. I will say this, the Wynn has changed their eggs benedict to use ham instead of smoked salmon as their ""default"" way of preparing it. But after a little reorganizing with the smoked salmon they had at another station, I got it the way I wanted it and how they use to prepare it. To be honest, with the ham wasn't that bad either as I left the second one as is. It was equally as good since they use a good cut of ham. The sausage was good and juicy and the bacon was crispy like I like it! You go to some buffets and restaurants for that matter and the smoked salmon can sometimes get waaay too salty *cough* Bellagio *cough*, but the smoked salmon here is to die for and smoked perfectly.

Afterward, I got a various number of pastries at their massive pastry station. Man it was good. I can easily say it has got to be the best pastries in a buffet I have eaten. You know that is made fresh each day by someone who is actually a pastry chef. That's the difference between the Wynn buffet and the others. I will pay extra if I am getting something extra and in this case it is yummy food. The detail, flavor and care in making the food means I will definitely be back again!",2,0,1

Now I was debating on rather to eat here or eat the Buffets of Buffets at the Harrah's, we choose this place because we stayed at the Encore Wynn Hotel and it was close by and we wouldn't have to take Taxi there and back.  Lunch\/Dinner have the same menu items and there is no price difference between lunch and dinner it is priced at $34.99.  They also have a breakfast buffet which is like only $21.  The line wait is not long at all and they have a lot of seating.  Most drinks are free such as Coke, Juice, and Milk.  They only thing they charge extra for is wine and alcohol.  Now let's breakdown my favorite foods from this buffet shall we...

Appetizers:
-Thin Crust Pizza (Pep, Pesto, Cheese, and Veggie)
-Asian Chicken Salad
-Pasta with Meat
-Naan Bread with Indian style Garbanzo Beans
-Crispy Fried Pita Bread
-Butternut squash risotto

Main Dishes
-Prime Rib
-Whole Lamb
-Pork Veal
-Short Ribs (mango flavored and reg.)
-Jerk Chicken (actually really nice, not really a jerk)
-Smoked Salmon
-Mahi mahi
-other I can't remember

Asian\/Seafood
-Alaskan Crab legs (better than King Crab, already cracked also)
-Chicken Chow Mien
-Indian Fried Rice
-Variety of Sushi
-Shrimp
-Beijing Beef Salad

Appetizers
-Fresh Crepes (made by a real chef on the spot)
-Ice Cream Parlor (real person serving you, 8 different flavors to choose from)
-8-10 different types of cakes (black forest cake best chocolate cake i ever had)
-Cupcakes (red velvet)
-Cookies and Pastries
-Chocolate covered marshmallows and chocolate covered rice krispies treats

Came here for brunch last weekend. I especially enjoyed the duck confit salad with the clover sprouts. It was the best duck confit salad I've ever had!! I also really liked the congee bar, which later switched into a chicken panang bar, which was also really impressive, but I thought the portions the chefs gave out (because they make it for you right there) were way too big. The tables all around us got the same thing, and from observations, everyone's went to waste because it's a buffet! We're all stuffing ourselves with other delicious goodies already.

Another highlight was the end of my meal: coffee and sugar-free cheesecake. Cheesecake was, hands down, best ever. Moist, rich, but not too rich, and just the right amount of deliciousness in a tiny, sugar-free square. Mm mm good. I didn't get a chance to try everything (the charcuterie assortment looked AMAZING but my conscience always overpowers me when it comes to meat (aside from duck-- it's the only animal that has to be afraid of me!), so alas, I did not partake.)

The seafood selection was really good. No famed crab legs as mentioned in all the other reviews, but I did have the Manhattan clam chowder, the sea bass with olive tapenade, and salmon.

However, because it was a slow non-holiday Tuesday so the food selection was not its best but still fair for its price.

Due to the number of people that was there, many of the food was visibly already dried up on the top but still tasted good.

If they can improve on the selection, I would have given it a four stars rating.

The staff was friendly and was quick to respond to requests.",0,0,0

Comes with basic drinks & super-awesome thermos pitcher that keeps the coffee steaming hot. The environment was very upscale & whimsical, like the rest of the casino. Selection was incredible. A lot of the food looked good, but didn't taste that great.

We started out with some seafood. DH did not recommend the oysters. ""Didn't taste fresh,"" he said. The dim sum was really mediocre. Avoid like the plague if you've had real dim sum. Also, don't get anything fried that has been sitting under a heat lamp. Fish & chips hard & dehydrated. Yuck.

The highlight was the prime rib. It was moist & juicy, so nice with the au jus. ""It was the best value of the buffet,"" said DH. The cocktail shrimp were okay, but the house-made sauce was awesome.

We tried a lot of the desserts and some had weird foam-like over whipped cream. Not too appealing. The lava cake was pretty good. Their ice cream was okay, but not as dense as the super premium stuff.

The guy who was our waiter was super attentive. If you don't leave a coat on your chair, they have no way to tell whether you're leaving for good. Be sure to leave a tip on the table for these hard working folks!",5,0,4

The dishes were all pretty good, there was lots of variety, and most of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh.

From the elaborately decorated dining hall to the plethora of food on display, it was pure eye candy. And it wasn't bad on the stomach either!

Let me set the scene. The restaurant was filled with fake, oversized fruit trees, and mint-green striped wall paper. I was indoors, but I definitely felt like I was in a perfectly-pruned, fairytale-like garden. I was Alice and I was eating in Wonderland. 

On with the amazing food. We came here for brunch and after waiting for about twenty minutes, we were seated. Three walls of the buffet were filled with every single brunch entree imaginable. Starting from your normal breakfast staples like cereal, sausages and pancakes the line of food went on to cross country lines with pizza, pasta, chow mien, and dim sum. I give The Buffet a ""pat on the back"" with their offering of jook, a Chinese rice porridge complete with the fixings including thousand year old egg bits. I'm also impressed with the omelet bar which served piping hot omelets with whatever your heart desires. Love it!

The Dessert section of the buffet made me feel like a kid in a candy store. I didn't know what to choose! Ultimately I settled on the ice cream which was good, a rich chocolaty brownie, and a candied apple. I was surprised they even had candied apples to choose from and although I didn't particularly like it, the offering did not go unnoticed. 

The brunch may be a little bit pricey ($30 for the buffet, $6 for the champagne option) but it's well worth the price. 

Bottom Line: Food was great and setting was even better. Be prepared to enter into the magical world of all-you-can-eat heaven.",0,0,0

With a price tag of about $45 I was expecting a pretty darn good dining experience.  Instead I walked away very disappointed.  There is a lot of food and variety to pick from.  But good variety does not always translate to good tasting food.  The raw oysters did not taste fresh, were a bit fishy, and had the consistency of snot glued to a shell.  I have eaten enough raw oysters elsewhere to know a good one.  These were not.  The chilled shrimp with house cocktail sauce were quite good.  The crab legs (snow not king) were too salty for either my wife or I to eat.  The clam chowder was so-so and no better than what you might get at Denny's.  The mushroom bisque was a flavorless mess.  The prime rib was badly overcooked.  Apparently no one told the chefs that the standard temperature for prime rib is medium-rare, not medium-well.  The lamb chops were properly cooked to medium rare.  Desserts were the only thing really good.  The gelatos were great, but certainly not worth the admission price of $45.",1,0,0

Was considered holiday so they jacked the dinner price from thirtysomething to $49.99. With tax and tip it came out to $60. Honestly a TOTAL ripoff. Food was bleh. They had snow crab legs (no king crab) which was completely unacceptable when paying that much. I checked out the sushi bar and it was embarrassing to say the least. No sashimi and they had only 3 or 4 types of rolls. Minado's BLOWS them away. If you want to overpay for average buffet but want to be seen in a chic place, then go here. You're not paying for quality of food but the atmosphere. I do NOT recommend.

Also there was a 2 hour limit which our waitress reminded us of as well as noting the starting time on the receipt. There also appeared to be a 2 max drink because my friend only got one refill on his OJ and the waitress never came back. I told him to ask for another but he didn't so we could be wrong.",1,0,0

Dinner has giant crab legs, already pre-sliced in half!  Not only do they do the hard work for you, the flesh tastes so sweet and fresh like they spray it with sugar water...

My parents being super picky eaters and food snobs of restaurants liked The Buffet. Need I say more?

Suggestion: do avoid high season\/peak times unless you are willing to wait 40 mins - 2.5 hrs!  Worth the wait though, especially with our smartphones in hand to keep us entertained.

I also don't think the additional cost of champagne to their lunch price (+$15 per person) is worth it, as they seem understaffed in refilling drinks.  Meaning you might receive 1 refill, if you flag down a server.",1,0,0

Perhaps years ago, but ""The Buffet"" as of 2014 is nothing special. Yes, the decor is eye catching, colorful and elegant. The food presentation is nice and with variety. I was most excited by the dessert section and wanted to try almost everything. The mini desserts in shot glasses were just so adorable! The space is clean and about the right price for a Vegas buffet. So what went wrong?

Okay, after much anticipation to go to this buffet, we were rejected at the entrance because the guys in our group had on sleeveless shirts. WHAT??!! They ended up purchasing t-shirts. I was slightly turned off and maybe because of the heat and walking all day that I ended up not wanting to go in. But we came all the way here for the buffet. Anyhow, the sign about dress code policy stated something about see through tops for ladies. Honestly, the guys were dressed more modest and most appropriate compared to the gals that were let in wearing crop tops, v neck deeper than the Grand Canyon and super short shorts that they might as well be at a beach. 

Anyway, we came here for the food right? Well all of the fish were over cooked. The lamb and beef were chewy and nothing special in term of preparation. The mussels I had were bland and miles away from those I had in Philly (check out Monk's Cafe). I totally skipped the Chinese food section consisted of egg rolls, fried rice and lo-mein, which I am sure  you can find in Chinese takeout places and probably wouldn't taste the difference. I love pasta so I had to visit the Italian section that was ready to order. It was a choice between alfredo or marinara. Not a fan of the Olive Garden, but in this case I am thinking it would be better there. But I did like the three cheese ravioli though. And that was probably the best thing I ate at the buffet. Also stay super far away from the pizza. So then, I figure they couldn't mess up dessert but again I was disappointed, because the presentation looked so good!!! Even my favorite pistachio gelato was a letdown. If anything I was hoping for some fresh watermelon, simple fruits at least to cleanse my palate. But even that was not met. :(

Maybe I am picky, but the fact that it is VEGAS. I was expecting more.

The service is really nice here, people are friendly and come by you relatively quickly despite the size, so that's a plus.

The food is really mediocre though. I tried a lot of the the food, and I was not too thrilled about the taste.  Some of the food that was tasty was: kimchi, steak, the ice cream, pasta, sliders, and pizza. A lot of the other foods were not too great...

I would really advise you to try somewhere else instead of spending a lot of money here. If you want to eat at a buffet, there's Rock and Roll sushi, and a Korean BBQ (both all you can eat) about a minute down from Wynn hotel.

I get the idea, smaller portions help insure the quality of the food, but when the food isn't that great to begin with, it leaves me with the thought of ""what's the point""  I came here on a recommendation from the concierge and was told that The Buffet was just voted ""Best Buffet in Vegas"".  The VIP line was long and I didn't get that, I paid extra to get that VIP pass and I don't understand the wait.  I know that makes me look snobby, but I am not made of money, so when I shell out the cash to get the special treatment, I freaking want the special treatment.  We were seated and ignored for about twenty minutes.  It was busy, not that busy.  I was thirsty and the dude who came over brought us drinks once and never returned.  I sampled all the cuisine, the best of the mediocre were the lobster cannoli and the gnocchi.  The ice cream was good as well (big shocker there) but whipped cream was on the other side of the dessert station where the crepe line wrapped around the corner.  WTF??

My BF and I have sworn off buffets but we made an exception during our trip to Las Vegas. It's not that I'm against all-you-can-eat food but I am against the mediocrity that most buffets offer. I'd rather have three bites of something amazing, than thirty bites of something which can best be described as ""meh."" But when in Vegas I feel as though having at least one buffet is just something you must do. Much like you must see the fountains at the Bellagio. Your trip just would not be complete without it! 

So after scanning the Yelp reviews we decided to go to the buffet at the Wynn. We went with three other friends and after waiting in line for about 10 minutes we were seated. My BF and I strategically planned to eat our weight in Alaskan King Crab legs. I personally feel like that's really the only way to get your money's worth. Eat the most expensive thing you can find until you throw up! I take that back, eat the most expensive thing until you can't even think of eating it for a solid week. 

I waited in line for the crab legs and they were pre-cracked which I thought was AWESOME! Less time cracking legs and more time eating! While waiting in line there was an old Chinese lady who tried to cut and I totally froze her out of the way with two plates and a bowl of butter. Hey, I don't care how old you are, there is no cutting when it comes to crab! She made as though she didn't speak English, but the language of cutting is Universal and that sneaky senior citizen knew exactly what she was doing. I might sound heartless but my own Grandma is totally crafty, so don't even play me woman. I see right thru you and your ""Oh I didn't know'"" fake liners! Back of the line Grannie!

My BF and I tore through four plates of crab legs and our friends were dumbfounded. When you have hot butter to dip into, anything is possible! I stood up and said ""Now that I've got gout, I'm ready to move onto something else."" I have to say that everything else I ate was pretty mediocre. How do you top crab legs? It just can't be done. I can say that you should stay away from the tom yum soup station. That stuff was rancid! 

We ended our buffet experience with the dessert station. They made candy apples, crepes, rice crispy treats, creme brulee, gelato, etc. It was great! I had them make me a crepe with peaches and chocolate which was not a 10 but a solid 7. It's a buffet, what do you expect? 

Would I do it again? 50\/50 and it would totally depend on how big of a crab craving I had.

I was told dinner is probably best for vegetarians\/vegan.  I happened to decide brunch was the best time for us to go.

I struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about ""general"" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  

Why 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  

Good thing the ""Black pepper backed ham""  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  

One thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.

I feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    

I tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast \/ bunch.  One for dinner.  

On the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..

Real ice cream bar. Yes folks real homemade ice cream, all you can eat with all you can top. One of the toppings is toasted coconut, not that dry shredded coconut crap inside Almond Joy, but toasted coconut flakes and real toasted, fresh non-oily or rancid, almonds. Real hot fudge, and real hot caramel to go with your ice cream. I had the coconut ice cream--I would pay $40 to eat it again on a hot Vegas day. Coconut ice cream with lush creaminess and pieces of coconut meringue cookies inside topped with the toasted coconut and almonds. All you can eat creme brulee, need I say more about dessert? 

I would say the Wynn holds it own just fine against all the other buffets, there's not as much variety as the Rio or Aladdin (er Planet Hollywood now) but it's more organized and given the new price of the Bellagio buffet it seems like a bargain. The food is fresh and I really appreciate the details, fresh made chili sauce for the Asian cuisine, real cocktail sauce, etc. The seafood that was there was mostly fresh, the Alaskan crab legs were previously frozen as they usually are, but they were of good quality. The entrees change all the time, but most everything is average to very good. The fare is going to be the same at most buffets, but the Wynn seems to really duke it out with their presentation and their quality, it's just a notch above most of the buffets on the strip.

Oh don't get the candied apples, they're red, and they're cute, but the coating is actually hard candy. It's not chewy like caramel and it shatters like glass when you bite into it putting shards of sugar all over your face and teeth. It's not only a pain in the ass to eat but humiliating when you realize everyone saw you awkwardly trying to eat it politely. Of course I usually neglect to mention this to loved ones like my Mom on purpose.",3,2,2

The first thing you will notice (aside from dropping $160 for a party of four buffet), is the fresh flowers that adorn the main entrance. Vibrant colors, professionally  created floral arrangements. 

""Cornucopia"" comes to mind when you come to the various buffet lines. Tender servings of ginger-infused maki, salmon wellington, roast game hen, and even congee with fried cruller and 1000 year old eggs. 

Even the fruit selection is a cut above the rest. These guys know how to pick and serve pineapple (here's a hint, TI: cut the heart before serving!). 

The desserts are equally delectable, with raspberry cheesecake, various gelatos, and cream puffs with vanilla bean-flavored cream filling. 

Not everything was a hit (the bread pudding was a bit too dense; the smoked salmon was not sufficiently smokey; the candied apple shell required Fixodent to give your teeth extra ""bite"" power), but all in all, still worth checking out. 
And if you come for New Year's Eve dinner, they add lobster to the menu offering. But it becomes $64.95 per person (don't say I didn't warn you).

Bon appetit!",3,2,3

The service was also lacking; we didn't have anyone to bring water until after we'd already eaten our first plate. My bf asked for a coke and was forgotten. After paying $40 for our brunch and fighting for basic service, we filled up on the only decently good items we found: mashed potatoes, bacon, rice...sad times. 
After trying to make the best of it we became increasingly unhappy with the food and service and complained. We were told that since we had been there over 20 minutes we could not be comped but they would talk to the chef. We will not be coming back. I'm sure it's a different deal for dinner but if you want brunch, don't waste your time here. Bellagio would be a better bet.",2,3,1

OK, first tip.  I signed up for their player card.  No biggie right?  Easy, breezy beautiful gambling girl.  But here is the catch.... if you rack up enough points on that day you get 2 passes to the Buffet.  So what did I do?  I got my money and sat at the Nickel and Quarter slots.  I got free drinks, won $200 AND ate at the Buffet free.

Next tip.  Go half an hour before dinner pricing starts.  But eat slow..... if at all.  Then when dinner kicks in (and the crab comes out) attack that buffet as if your life depended on it.  That worked for me..... except we ate so much we couldn't drive home and had to get a room for another night.  I ate myself into a coma.

I must say, from the start of when it was opened, yes it has been phenomenal.  Though I personally don't think the quality of food has diminished, I just think the courses and items are very different than they were before.

Out of every single buffet that is located in Vegas, the best by far has and will always be the Wynn.  Why do you ask? Breakfast.  That's the only answer.  And there are only two things I can tell you that are worth going for:  Corn and Congee.

Let me tell you something about the corn here:  

A while back I was chatting about how great the food was at the Wynn.  He asked me what I loved about the Wynn and I told him the Corn.  Here's the funny thing:  Both of our fathers love the corn too.  And before you say anything:  Yeah it's that good.

Every buffet is different and has a different rotation.  When I mean best buffet, I seriously meant best for BREAKFAST.  The quality and preparation of the food is very intriguing.

Unfortunately, unless you eat the king crab legs, the rest of the food is not worth eating.  And because I don't eat seafood, I was quite disappointed.  While everyone raves about the crab legs, I would like to judge the buffet based on its prime rib.  The cuts of prime rib I had were very fatty.  Not top quality.  the cheeses tasted like they had been left out for a while and tasted stale.  The pastas were not very good.  Needless to say, nothing really impressed me to even write about. 

The desserts were good, but not worth spending the $40 on.  I loaded up on these since I was still hungry from not eating much that was very appealing.  The service for drinks was also bad.  I got up and helped myself to more iced tea.",1,0,0

This is our second time doing buffet in Vegas and decided to try the Wynn buffet (our first time was at wicked spoon). So far both were good but we seem to like this one better. It had more dinner options like ribs, steak, crab legs, crab claws --you know the expensive stuff everyone goes for first at a buffet. A lot of options!! Everything from sushi, dim-sum, Indian, pizza, Italian--just something for everyone. Although their vegetarian option is limited (let's be real here, you don't go to a buffet for their vegetarian options). Most of their salads are showcased at the end and it doesn't seem like it's very popular. By the time I got to the end, the salad looked soggy like it's been there for awhile.

When choosing a Vegas buffet, I was worried that most buffets cater to a crowd looking for great steak, seafood etc. I mainly picked the Wynn based on the dessert choices that I read about. I was definitely not disappointed in that regards.
But the food really exceeded my expectations as there was a lot of variety even for vegetarians.

This place barely tops above Bellagio and The Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.   Their food choices is huge.  You won't be able to try out each of their dishes without getting stuffed to the point of button implosion.  Some of their dishes are hit and misses though but you can definitely tell the difference in quality and care they put into their food compared to other hotel buffets.  Their meat selections are good and juicy.  Not too dry compared to other places and decently seasoned.   The one dish that was interesting was their green snow pea risotto with truffle oil.  After two servings though, it gets a bit much because of the truffle oil.  Everything else is good.  They have a decent selections of desserts as well.

When we got there, we realized it was $34.95 for dinner. That's a lot for someone who just had McDonald's that morning and Pizza Hut last night. However, it was the end of a pretty long day and the line wasn't that long at 6:30pm on a Tuesday, so we figured we'd go for it.

It probably took 15 minutes or so to get seated. It wasn't that crowded and we were joking that they probably made people wait because it's a mandatory part of the buffet experience, but we realized that they didn't have too many staff members on hand to serve drinks and clean tables and whatnot. When we started piling up empty dishes, they stayed there on our table for quite a while. I expected better service for what the dinner cost.

The food was good, and there was a wide selection. I knew that I couldn't have everything, so I skipped things such as mashed potatoes and corn on the cob - why would you go to such an expensive buffet to eat those? I picked out more unusual and exotic selections such as octopus ceviche, veal, lamb T-bone, rabbit pasta, sushi (ok, couldn't resist), and pierogies. Oh, and of course the king crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and prime rib. I'm still pretty stuffed, so I'll just say that everything was pretty good.

After taking a brief break, we headed to the dessert section. They're pretty interesting, with some even served in shot glass-like cups. I had a delicious tiramisu that way. I really enjoyed the chocolate\/banana dessert and would've gone for seconds if I had more stomach room. The mint chocolate mousse was really interesting - it made me want to put down my toothbrush, spit out the contents of my mouth, and gargle some water. Yes, it tasted exactly like toothpaste.

I wanted to try the ice cream (gelato?) at the end, but it was getting late and I preferred to visit the crepe station instead. The strawberry filling was popular, but I skipped it because it didn't look like much. It's probably still delicious I guess. I enjoyed the blueberry that I asked for, but I left the apricot on my plate because it tasted somewhat artificial and had an odd texture.

So how did I enjoy the meal overall? For the price of $34.95, it was pretty good. I don't go to Vegas everyday, after all. However, the service was somewhat lacking, and my financial sensibilities were offended.  I'll probably opt for something more inexpensive next time I visit Vegas.",0,0,0

Cornish game hen - I believe it's adobe glazed and fantasticly soft 5.5 stars if possible

Bacon chipotle pasta - I try not to eat carbs here, but it was really, really good

Coconut curry\/mustard (some yellow sauce) sea bass - sea bass is expensive and oh so soft and melt in your mouth, amazing

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, cr√®me brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato\/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

If you're not an early riser (like some of us in Vegas) you should expect long lines, or splurge for the VIP treatment.  In my experience the line is shorter, you'll be seated closer to the buffet line, and includes a complimentary mimosa because clearly you didn't have enough to drink the night before.  What the heck?

If you can sit in the middle, under the atrium window, it definitely adds to the experience. Exactly the kind of food that I wanted to eat. The Wicked Spoon as Cosmo on a Monday at 11am was very mismatched with not too much I actually wanted to eat. The Bacchanal at Cesars for Sunday brunch was good but I hated their dining area.

While they couldn't accommodate all us at one table, they were nice enough to put us at smaller tables in near proximity to each other. This was at 6pm though, when it was terribly busy yet. 

Food wise, this place is probably the creme de la creme of buffets. I've eaten at most great buffets for dinner in Vegas, including Spice Market, Bellagio, and Rio. While I would say they're all great, everyone seems to love the Wynn buffet. To correct the review below me, they serve king crab legs, not snow crab legs. One thing I don't like about them however, is that they serve their king crab legs cut open down the middle. While some people may view this as easier to eat, I actually prefer my crab legs whole, giving me the ability to crack them open and pull out a nice large chunk of crab meat. Just personal preference... They have a massive dessert station to fulfill your sweet tooth. I mean, they pretty much have everything except I've never seen lobster tail, caviar, or foie gras... 

So why only 4 stars? Well, I'm actually not a big fan of buffets, I usually just go because everyone else wants to go (peer pressure, right?). Part of the reason for that is because I have a relatively small stomach and can't really eat that much. Because of that, I don't really feel the price paid is worth it for me, about +$40 for dinner. Thus, I'm not giving a star for value rating. This would probably apply to all fancy buffets in Vegas though. I'd probably be happy enough with a 2nd tier buffet in Vegas versus a premium one. 

Note: I've been here before for Thanksgiving dinner and the wait was a nightmare (close to 2 hours?). Would definitely avoid it for occasions like that.",0,0,0

The Pad Thai was aweful.  Fish was dry.

It's not THAT bad.  They do have shrimp, delicious yogurt parfait, the usual great selection of desserts.  But with the long wait and ~$40\/person, I'd expect them to try their Pad Thai and dry fish before feeding it to us.  All of us felt unsatisfied.

Its about $49 and change when tax is added in. We avoided a really long line so it was nice to get in quickly. If you indulge in this brunch buffet package, don't get the blood mary. The bloody mary at Wynn was about as confusing and unsatisfying as drinking hot tea in a swimming pool mid-August. Being southern, my expectations might be high, but since the bloody mary is one of the classic ""hangover cocktails"", I figured Wynn could get it slightly right. It's basically thin, sour tomato juice with vodka--no pepper, no spices. My friends ordered mimosas which they said were good, so order that instead! The coffee was actually pretty good though. 

Definitely try the prime rib with some creamy horseradish on the side. It's pink, tender, juicy--the horseradish adds some light zing. Great combo! I went back for seconds on that. The green beans were crunchy, lightly seasoned and buttery. Whatever you do, grab a cup of the fresh grapefruit with brown sugar and fresh mint chiffonade...excellent! I'm going to make that at home from now on! 

The dessert counter is very pretty---each dessert portion is a small work of art. As for flavor? Not so much. However, the coconut sorbet is a winner (for people who love coconut like I do). If I go back I'll definitely sample each of the various sorbet flavors instead of the other desserts. 

The shrimp cocktail was fresh but average. Nothing else other than the grapefruit, sorbet and prime rib blew me away.

The cooking quality is definitely on the better side from other buffets around here. What they lacked was variety and creativity, but I still liked what i had.

What is the definition of endless bottomless then? And it wasn't 2 hours yet? Did the clock start ticking when I paid for my food or when we actually got seated and served our drinks?

2. Food

Not too many selections in my opinion unless you are going to an expensive buffet to eat cheap carbohydrates like bread, potatoes and rice. Only one small section of seafood. Very little king crab as it was mostly snow crab. The oysters tasted old and like rubber. Very inferior to the bacchanal buffet!

Pros:
1. Nice ambiance 

2. Restrooms were located inside the buffet eating area

We asked to speak to a manager about the confusion of their ""endless bottomless drinks."" Our manager, Tiffany came over to speak to us. From the beginning I sensed she was being defensive and in a bad mood. Her explanation for stopping our endless bottomless drinks was I have been drinking for 2 hours already. I corrected her about our start time and our slow server. She didn't apologize. She kept on throwing this policy and that policy to my face. Then she justified ending the endless bottomless drinks because she didn't want the buffet to lose their liquor license. She said a big person can drink a lot but someone small cannot. So at some point they got to stop. Her explanation was irrelevant and quite discriminating. So if you are obese or big they will not interrupt your drinks for 2 hours. If you look like you can't handle it they will stop it. 

If I wanted to get drunk I would not go to a freaking buffet to drink SPARKLING WINE!!! I was in Las Vegas and I can get better booze anywhere. 

In the end there was no resolution nor an apology. Tiffany needs serious customer service training. As a customer we don't need to hear or care about your stupid policies. Policies are for you to understand and enforce. Customers come to Vegas to have fun and in this buffet they want to stuff their faces silly and drink all they want if they paid for the endless bottomless drinks option for 2 hours regardless if they are big or small.",8,1,0

In my opinion, The Buffet at the Wynn is to the Rio Seafood Buffet as Deron Williams is to Kobe Bryant - it's decent and respectable, but falls a few inches short of the greatest (three inches, to be exact).  Vegas buffets in general are top notch in comparison to the typical redneck buffet fare the rest of this country is accustomed to (ahem, Country Harvest), so you won't leave any of them feeling hoodwinked by culinary tomfoolery.  But when comparing Vegas buffets amongst each other in the bubble of excess, gluttony, and well, morbid obesity that is Las Vegas, you gots to drop some criticism where the criticism is due.

This place is just ok.  The decor is amazing and the ambiance is radiant, but since we can't eat the plastic flowers let's just ignore this category and focus on the food.  They've got the typical Vegas buffet fare, e.g. sushi rolls, pizza, roasted chicken, prime rib, salad bar, chinese food, soup, blah blah blah, all of which they do reasonably well.  A few stars of the show:  

1.  The Whole-Grain Mustard Seed Bacon.  Juicy, salty, pork belly encrusted with whole-grain mustard seed (which looks like peppercorn).  Enough said.  And if you don't like bacon, well, pox on you for being blasphemous.  I give this bacon three ""Daaamn Gina!""s.

2.  The Pulled Pork Sliders.  Pulled pork and cole slaw on cornbread.  Also a baller item.

3.  The Prime Rib.  Really, prime rib is getting way too cliche at Vegas Buffets - can you guys switch over to Porterhouse or something?  It was good, but ya know, it's pretty good everywhere you go in Vegas.  We're not talking House of Prime Rib in San Francisco good or Stinking Rose in Los Angeles good, but Lamar Odom good.

4.  The Dessert Bar.  Nice selection of sweets from ice cream and sorbet to cookies and pastries, glittered cupcakes to various pudding \/ mousse-like concoctions.  My favorite was a caramel \/ coconut \/ rice pudding cup (minus the white grapes at the bottom - totally inappropriate for this dessert - I suggest you leave them at the bottom of the cup).

A disclaimer:  my true love is the crab legs at the Rio Seafood Buffet.  I can tear through those like napalm through a Vietnamese jungle, so I was disappointed when I found out that crab is only served at the Wynn on Fridays and Saturdays.  I'll have to save that review for next time.

The verdict:  if you're fiending for some yellow-top buffet crack but don't have the financial wherewithal or desire to hop your rumpus into a car to travel to the Rio, The Buffet At The Wynn is not a bad alternative.  It'll leave you just satisfied coming out as it did going in.  But I digress.

Happy endless eating Vegas-goers!",6,5,2

I'm no Buffet expert, but I definitely am in agreement with most of the Yelpers on here by saying: Holy Crap, this place is good! And I'm not just saying that because it was free for us. This place is probably one of the few buffets, in life, that I feel is deserving of the price point. 

First of all, it's in the Wynn, so you know the ambiance is nice. We were staying over at Encore and got a deal where two free buffet passes came with the room rate. We headed over for dinner on a Saturday night around 7:30. Surprisingly, not much of a wait. As with all buffets, I like to make my rounds to scope out the offerings before deciding what I want to eat and I'm going to go ahead and suggest you guys do the same. Why? You will grab everything along the way because it all looks so good and, before you know it, you will have an insane heap of food on your plate.

A lot of reviewers say there wasn't a lot of variety, but I don't know how much more you need. And this food? Fucking Quality. I'm so serious. I actually was shocked to experience such great food at a Buffet. Even it is the Wynn. Just thinking about the food makes me want to go back. Seriously. It was that good.

They have a selection of pastas, Asian food, loads of meat. I mean, LOADS. I've never seen my boyfriend eat so much meat in his life and suffered through the meat sweats to prove it.

Some of my favorites were: Mac and Cheese, Ravioli, Garlic Cauliflower, Batter fried chicken w\/syrup (to taste like chicken and waffles), chicken dumplings, asparagus, Chicken Sausage (yes! Chicken Sausage) and all the assorted shellfish. Even their pizza was decent and buffet pizza is NEVER good, usually. I didn't even scrape the surface at this place either. They had an entire cheese and cracker section, and their desserts? Good golly, Miss Molly! It was so hard to decide. And they were ALL good.

I will emphatically recommend this place to anyone looking for a buffet in Vegas. There is something for everyone here and this may be the only buffet I ever revisit in Vegas.",2,5,2

It's all quality here at the Wynn in Las Vegas. If that isn't enough to convince you to give it try, they say you have a 2 hour time limit. However, that is only if they are packed with people. If there is enough seating then stay as long as dinner permits (3pm-10pm actually) or until they kick you out.

In general anything you get here will taste above average; however, that may be an understatement, it is gourmet food after all.

First rule of buffets: eat the expensive items such as crab legs, shrimp, prime rib\/steak and forget the fillers, carbs and inexpensive items like chicken, sausage, pasta. 

My BF and I hit up 3 buffets this weekend: Bacchanal, Flavors Buffet and the Wynn. The verdict: the Wynn is the worst and cheap out on their buffets like their beds and decor in their rooms. I am no longer a Wynn fan after staying here and the room was just so cheaply decorated and had barely any finishing features and the largest beds were full size if you request 2 beds, whereas every other hotel had queens. And now the last straw was the buffet. The first rule couldn't apply because they didn't have any expensive items, mostly fillers. I swear we thought we saw pictures of lunch crab legs... Maybe we were mistaken??? Far disappointed I can tell you that! 

We came here thinking there would be crab legs or even shrimp for lunch as other buffets on the strip have crab legs and shrimp for lunch. This one cost about $40 ish each and the food was crap. It was all fillers and nothing worth your money. Well I guess the steak was but the stingy ass lady gave only a max of 2 at a time! I asked for more and she ignored me and said next. Seriously?? It's a buffet! And I'm fat, I want more than 2 measly thin steaks without having to keep going back. 

Other unimpressive food offerings: lots of carbs, breads, ramen, turkey, sausage, pasta, crap food that cost nothing to make but full of salt and carbs. Not much of a good variety or even worth the high price for lunch. 

We were very disappointed and felt ripped off that they didn't have crab legs or shrimp for lunch or any other good items! No seafood! Even Flavors Buffet at Harrahs had crab legs and shrimp! Only ""good"" thing was the dessert selection was plentiful. I enjoyed my crepe, chocolate covered strawberries, mango tapioca and ice cream.

First of all, there was a line forming when we arrived between 3:30 and 4pm on a weekday, but we couldn't figure out why. The older people at the front of the line were clearly tired of standing and had been there 15 minutes by the time my friend and I had arrived. Yet, there were uniformed Buffet staff all over the place and empty tables visible from the line.  We waited about 10 minutes ourselves with no clear explanation as to why.  

Another thing that bugged me was that the woman working the entrance had very unappealing-looking hair that seemed both unwashed and uncombed. Usually I don't criticize people's appearance, but since she's working for a food establishment, she should have at least washed her hair.  First impressions mean a lot.

Anyway... we finally were led to a table and I swear, half the place was empty. An entire section was even closed off, and the section we were seated at was only half full, if that much.  Plenty of wait staff around.  Our waiter was friendly but poorly attentive and unintuitive. For example, he didn't come around to refill our tea so we had to grab his attention.  My friend asked for more tea, so he refilled hers and ignored the fact that my glass was almost empty.   Later, when she asked him for another napkin he came back and hurriedly handed two to her  -up close to her face - which was rather awkward and strange.  

So, let's talk about the food. It was fine. The buffet struck me as a tad sloppy when I first walked in - sauces dripped onto the counters in one section, and some general messiness.  We tried a little bit of many things, this being a buffet. Nothing I had was bad, but their selection wasn't as varied as I imagined it might be.    They apparently change the menu relatively often, from what my friend says.  I asked her what she thinks of the Wynn, having been there two or three times now, and she said she isn't all that impressed- she just gets comps there once in a while so she goes.

Seems like others reviewing the Wynn really loved it. As a resident who is no longer wowed by ""Vegas,""  my review is also influenced by my experiences at buffets I liked much better, like the Rio and Mandalay Bay.  I was quite surprised at the lower quality I experienced at a location as exalted as the Wynn.  I'm wondering if we came during a shift change- that could explain the long wait for a table in a near-empty dining space, the inattentive waiter, and the messy buffet.

It was recommended to us by my wife's girlfriend who goes to Vegas regularly.  The sign said they have king crab.  I should has just walked in to take a look first because paying.  It was snow crab, not the advertised king crab.  They didn't have any other kind of shell fish other than the snow crab and shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  You would usually find some clams and mussels at a buffet in one of the main casinoes.  I don't know if Sunday night has anything to do with it, but they didn't have that many of the food you would expect from a $35 buffet.  The prime rib was decent but not over cooked.  The prime rib was the only meat they offered at the carving station.

The only good thing from the buffet is the dessert.  Their creme brulee is very good and rivals that of a high end restaurant.  The ""gelato"" is very good.  I don't think it's really like gelato, but everything in Vegas is called gelato now.

Wow, there's much more to choose from at this buffet, and the international food was actually tasty. My favorite dish was hands down the winter mushroom fricasse. Lordy, I had two servings. I am a sucker for mushrooms, but the mushroom calzone was a miss. Lobster ravioli. DELICIOUS. 

I wish I would have filled up on the mushroom fricasse and the lobster ravioli - I'm still craving them. If more dishes stuck out to me as delicious, I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars.

I snuck out a cookie, three strawberries, a chocolate dipped rice crispie treat and two chocolate covered marshmallows for later.

This isn't a problem, she don't have to like the century egg.

Outside of that, I'd have to question the value to the $40 a head price tag on the lunch buffet at the Wynn.  Admittedly, the quality of the food here -far- exceeds that at the Paris buffet, but it darn well better be, considering the cost is 60% greater.  Plus, no unlimited champagne (that's an additional charge, according to the server).

Me being the fat girl that I am, I totally pigged out on the make-your-own caesar salad bar.  They have salad that's already pre-constructed, but because this is The Land of the Free and all... they also have additional croutons, shaved parmesan, extra lettuce, and a vat of caesar dressing so you can mix and match to your liking.  You know... in case their pre-fab caesar isn't perfect enough (which I thought it was).

Immediately next to the salad bar, they had a pretty measly selection of fruits, basically pineapple, papaya, honeydew, and cantaloupe.  Perhaps it's seasonal.  Eh - unimpressed.

But back to the french toast.  Since this was one of the very few actual American breakfast foods that I actually grew up with, it has a special place in my heart.  I've never liked pancakes or waffles, and I'm not ultra fond of french toast, of the three major starchy options, it's the one that I will at least make an attempt at enjoying.  I think that some of my reticence around committing to loving french toast was that I've never had french toast like -this- before.  Light, soft, and ready to soak up the hot syrup and strawberry compote, this stuff absolutely melted apart in my mouth.  Mmm.

The bottom line is that I'd rather just hit a sit-down joint.  It'd end up costing less, and I'd have fewer opportunities to overeat, given my dual compulsions to 1) maximize the value of my money and 2) finish everything on my plate.

Even the dessert offerings were paltry, in comparison to former glory days, anyway.

Not only did we not have to wait, there were practically tumbleweeds blowing through the place.

Here is what I think: The Wynn no longer wants to have a buffet, perhaps not wanting ""buffet people"" cluttering up the place, and they are letting it die by inches, seeing how long they can still milk some $ out of their guests. And maybe this will be a trend. But don't do this to people who are expecting a treat.

Since moving to Las Vegas, we have hit several of the local buffets so I can without a doubt say that the crab legs and shrimp alone are worth the price of admission.  The Wynn slices their crab legs in half so there is no cracking or picking required.  They also serve their shrimp peeled and deveined for less mess.  Sure, other places do the same, but their shrimp are small (Hilton), too wet or rubbery.  These are perfectly cooked, cocktail-size shrimp.  The Wynn will also serve you a HUGE portion of prime rib, which I will agree is a bit on the bloody side.  Do yourself and favor and hit the crab legs and shrimp FIRST, then make the rest of your circuit.  For the price you are paying, eat yourself sick on the best stuff early.  And skip the sushi & pizza- it's mediocre at best.  
For dessert, unless you see something that REALLY catches your eye, leave the buffet line and hit Sugar and Ice Ice Cream Parlor at the end of the shops just before the doors to the walkway over The Strip.  They have the best homemade ice cream I have ever had- the Lemon Tart is without equal!  Sit outside beside the waterfalls and enjoy!",0,0,0

I had also asked people to give me their honest opinions about comparing the two buffets. 

For anyone that reads this review, go with the Bellagio Buffet. 

Everything about it is much better. Even the setup of it is more inviting. The setup at the Wynn wasn't too great. Plus, they had way too much junk like Pizza and not enough variation of sushi and other items that people are a bigger fan off.

The star of the buffet was the rack of lamb.. the meat was perfectly cooked, tender and well seasoned. I kept going back for more and more :) The au jus sauce was blah though...

The crab legs are larger and have much more flavor. Their whole-roasted bacon, prime rib and other roasts are unbeatable. Their desserts are just awesome -- the tiramisu is presented very nicely in a small shot glass and is just tasty. During the brunch, the eggs benedict is just awesome.

Well, I can go on and on about it, but you should just try it for yourself and make your own decision.

My personal tip: Everyone says to come around 2:30 so you can get the brunch\/lunch-dinner shift. I would say come around 2:00 instead because they stop replacing the good food in order to prepare for the next meal. For dinner, they don't start bringing all the good stuff until 4:30 anyway.

Tips and tricks from a bunch of scheming money-saving Asians:

$35 for weekend brunch (I think for dinner, it's another $5, and if you want the Champagne brunch, it's about $40).

Tip #1:  TIMING and PRICING
To get the full spectrum of food awesomeness, the WHOLE enchilada (mmm, i do want enchilada right now...), order the brunch around 2:30pm - 3:00pm.  Why?  Well, dinner starts at 3:30pm, so if you get there at around 2:30pm, you'll probably wait in line for about 15 minutes, pay the cheaper rate for brunch, and then get seated and ready to hit the buffet line and access all the brunch items by 3:00pm.  You can eat two or three plates of brunch items for about 30 minutes.  Then, right around 3:30pm, they change up the buffet lines and bring out all the new dinner items.   And, BAM, that's where you come in, ready to hit up the dinner buffet.  And you can get it all while it's fresh and hot too.  Two meals for the price of one; a ton of variety for $35.  Makes sense?  YES, I think so too!

Tip #2: CONSUMPTION STRATEGY
This is a generic eating tip. Go SLOWLY.  You'll be able to consume more and digest better.  I alternate between heavy and light plates, and the Buffet at Wynn certainly has its share of light and heavy items.  They've got everything!  For example, I started out my first plate with a giant omelet, and some other carnivorous items.  My second plate, I opted for some vegetables, fruit, yogurt.  Third plate I returned to a combination of light and heavy, with some seafood pot pie, balanced out by a light salad and some more veggies.  That way, you can pack in more, and enjoy it along the way.  It's all about eating respectable amounts, but still getting a taste of EVERYTHING. 

Tip #3: THE FOODS
Now, we'll get to the actual foods that you should devour.  The seafood pot pie was HEAVENLY.  It was so full of flavor and the puff pastry parts were light, crispy, airy.  A must-eat.  Well, unless you're vegetarian, in which case this buffet might be a waste of your time and money.  The duck salad was amazing too.  Tender slices of duck packed some mean flavor into the light spring greens mix.  A good cleansing meal in between heavy rounds.  The desserts are all pretty good, and I especially liked this thin chocolate cake\/wafer item and another cube strawberry layer cake with some kind of cream\/custard in the middle.  A warning on deceptive foods that aren't actually so good: the omelet is tempting but just average, it will fill you up because it's really large, so be careful.  Also, you might be tempted to get the mini Kobe slider because, after all, it's KOBE.  Well, it's also not very good, the bread is hard, and the meat is dry.  Don't be deceived.  Save room in your stomach for the better things.

There is a smorgasbord of great foods here, and it's probably one of the better buffets in Vegas.  I was very impressed by the variety, which has something to satisfy everyone.  Hunks of carved meat, extensive seafood and sushi, many different kinds of salads, cheese and cold cuts, fruits, huge variety of desserts, hot entrees ranging from Italian to Asian, and everything else you'd expect at a Vegas buffet, and probably more that you wouldn't even think of.

Half a star off because the service wasn't so great, nobody filled my cup of water\/juice the entire couple hours I was there.  

But hey, it's a buffet, so it's about the food, not the service.  And the food is AWESOME.  

Take my advice; follow the strategy; leave happy, satisfied, and most importantly COMFORTABLE.  And I say ""most importantly"" because the worst feeling is coming out of a buffet feeling like a whale.  I went outta there feeling very satisfied and happy that I ate a large yet respectable, classy amount.

Mission accomplished!",7,0,3

Don't get me wrong, the food there is very good still. But compared to the Bellagio, with the same prices and expectations, the Wynn buffet definitely fell short. 

The selection lacked depth displayed by the dessert bar where they ran out of Creme Brulee (an absolute outrage for fans of the crispy caramelized sugar shell) and Bellagio has twice the selection. Besides the jumbo shrimp, there wasn't much seafood; the crab legs looked anorexic, skinnier than those of a Victoria's Secret model. The prime rib was great and so were a couple of other hot food items.

So for $35+, eat at the Bellagio. Go early on so you don't have to wait in line and Mon-Thurs so you don't pay the weekend premium.

Like any other Las Vegas buffet there is a variety of food from all over the world set up at different stations, a beef carving section and a seafood section which the popular choice is pre-cut crab legs. I tried to stay away from the normal foods I would eat and looked for stuff I can't have just anywhere or at least at a usual buffet. so i got some various salads, seafood and veggie dishes. the salads were hit and miss, there was an asparagus salad that really hit me favorably, but some were bland and lacked seasoning. also you could tell no one really touched them to much as some were soggy. the seafood was actually pretty good. i had salmon fillet and some type of mixed dish which were good enough for me to go twice. the prime rib was good and the butcher let me choose my piece and size, good plus there. of course the crab legs line was ridiculous but i still got some especially for the table. there were decent, definitely needed to add some flavor to it, whether it be adding butter, lemon, pepper, whatever you prefer. i stay away from sushi at buffets generally and did not try any of that or the asian menu to much. the deserts were decent, but at the end of the night they were running out of a lot of stuff. it was decent overall, but its a buffet what can i say. to get 4 stars for me at a buffet it needs to have excellent food that i can't get anywhere else. prime rib and crab are good but almost commonplace in Vegas or Reno now.",0,0,1

For lunch they served huge jumbo shrimp, ceviche (even the shrimp in the ceviche was big), cali rolls, prime rib, asian food, etc.  For dinner they started bringing out the big daddy king crab legs, and lamb chops.  the lamb was smokin delicious.  In total, my friends stayed there from 1:30pm to around 4pm.  The service was excellent as well.  Highly recommend it if you're ready to stuff your face in some good food.",0,0,0

We went back last week and the food quality has really deteriorated. Selections such as Mac n cheese, mushroom bisque, and potstickers were all very unmemorable. All dishes were overly salty. Crab legs were sub-par and served cold. Perhaps this is the norm? I've only had hot ones in the past, that were far fresher and more flavorful. At least they are sliced in half lengthwise for easy access to the meat. My companion had shrimp cocktail and didn't mention it being particularly good. I had a lot of seafood during my stay in Vegas and none of it impressed. There was a station with turkey and prime rib waiting to be carved, however, each time I walked by there was no one to be found to serve me so I can't comment on that. There was a good section of vegetables and the roasted cauliflower was delicious, albeit tragically oversalted. I steered clear of the stir fries, fearing salt poisoning after having tasted other salt-laden dishes. I didn't try any Japanese items as none looked particularly appealing. At first glance, sushi rolls seemed to be too dense in rice and lacking fillings. The Italian section with its salamis and cheeses was tempting, but when you're paying $35 a plate you don't generally rush over for cheese and crackers. I think it might make a nice starter snack though in retrospect, since none of the main dishes were stellar. Soups were salty and lacking depth. Desserts were hit or miss, with the Black Forest cake lacking cherry or dark chocolate flavors and seeming to taste mostly just ""sweet"". I avoided the dense items such as cookies and cakes and went for the blood orange panna cotta which was delightful, and the mango tapioca which also proved a winner. The tiramisu was also pretty good. Service was excellent, drinks were always kept full, Arnold Palmer's were refreshing after one too many vodka sodas at the casino. I didn't think about tipping since the receipt at the cashier when you pay has a tip line, hopefully the server gets a share of that rather than just the cashiers! I had no cash so I couldn't leave her anything additional. I definitely won't be going back to the buffet. I was also hungry a few hours later, go figure! I was a bit irked by that. I suppose nothing was good enough for me to want to gorge myself. For those with less discriminating palates and larger appetites, it might be worth the cost but certainly not for my friend and I.",0,0,0

I would say that the best things about this buffet is the Alaskan Crab Legs and the Prime Rib.

nevertheless, the food was decent and there was quite a bit offered from italian, seafood, japanese, and so forth.

the highlights for me were the prime rib, beef brisket, clam chowder...and the ravioli.

i was a bit disappointed when it came to the har gow (shrimp dumpling), which tasted very bland and overcooked...as well as the crab legs (they were snapped open in half for convenience, but were very dry and not very flavorful).

But anyway, we came at around 3pm and paid only $25 and the selection was simply amazing! I'm not a big eater, but I think the price is all worth it!

They have eclectic selection of food from American, Italian, Thai, Chinese, etc. But I've only tried a couple and here are my faves:

The steak was freaking delicious. It was tender and very meaty. It was just how I wanted it - medium well. It wasn't pink and yet it wasn't well done. It was juicy and quite flavorful. It goes well with the string beans. It was a bit salty but the steak neutralizes its salty flavor which I think compliments each other. 

And oh, the king crab legs are definitely worth your money. I grabbed a plate full of it and it was as fresh as you can have it. They were gigantic and were very meaty. The shrimp were also huge and they were also as fresh. I personally like it with the tartar sauce. The cocktail sauce is quite tangy and spicy. I think they mix it with wasabi. I'm not so much a fan of wasabi.

And my most favorite is... the dessert bar!!! They have amazing treats for your sweet tooth. They have variety of cakes, different flavors of gelato, coated marshmallows, lemon meringue, tarts, and those layered sweets in plastic shot glasses. I don't remember what they are called but they were amazing! I loved most of them. But my favorite of them all is the CREME BRULEE!!!! It was absolutely delicious. It melts in my mouth. And it has crispy sugar on top that makes it sweet. Mmmmmmm! I would have had two of those but my tummy just couldn't handle anymore.

1) price:  Ya it's vegas, shit is expensive.  Thing is, there are comparable buffets for less (in the 20-30 dollar range).  The Wynn serves excellent food, but it's not so much better than the others that it is worth the extra dough.  IMO, if it cost 5-10 bucks less it would probably be the best buffet in vegas.  As it is, I'd still put it in the top ten, but not top 5.

2) Competition.  This is one of the cases where the Wynn is almost it's own worst enemy.  I've eaten at some of the other restaurants there, and they must be running the second string in the buffet, because the food in the other wynn places is noticeably better, and about the same price range (though not all you can eat)....

Price is expensive, but the food quality is superior since they put small portions on the buffet line to force their staff to refill the line more often.  This means you are less likely to scoop up food that has been sitting on the line for a very long time.

More of a regular buffet with superficial fluff.  

Mediocre in comparison to similar dining experiences at this price point.  So it's holiday season, and price is around $43+ per adult.  The general adage is that you get what you paid for, but this is one of those times it doesn't apply.  

The good:
Pretty decorations, pleasing ambiance, good variety of cuisines.
New dishes come out every so often if you stay at the buffet long enough.
Pork loin was very juicy and tender, you'd think it was ham.
Wife said turkey was excellent.
Dessert was great too.

The not so good:
Unfortunately within the variety, nothing really stands out.  
A lot of the variety consists of run-of-the-mill dishes from the cuisines they represent, and it was hard to find a dish within any of the cuisines that just stood out as above and beyond.  I remember having this ""wow"" factor at the Bellagio buffet during a holiday season past, but that was many years ago.  Too many dishes were just unimpressive fillers that you'd find at cheaper buffets.  

The crowd-pleaser seafoods such as oysters and crabs are indeed served during lunch time.
But get this... only after 2PM(!), when most people'd be done and gone on with their normal activities anyway.  Come on Wynn, really?  

The service was ok.  I wrote in the tip when we paid for the buffet, the same amount as if I'd sat in a full service restaurant.  The servers did what you asked but they got the same dollar amount not trying at all, as compared to the service at Lupo for example (if you've been to Lupo, you'd know what I mean).  Don't make the same mistake and tip them accordingly in cash later based on the service you got.

The most unfortunate experience was at the prime rib station.  You'd think, how could they mess prime rib up?  It wasn't the meat, it was the station server.  It was very simple: I wanted medium, and he totally ignored me and gave the dry and overdone piece.  Cause hey, I couldn't tell the difference anyway right?

To give the benefit of the doubt, I actually gave it a chance.  Upon tasting this piece of beef jerky of a prime rib, I asked my server to take it away, and talked to the manager.  Somehow, I feel that at a less expensive buffet, I would not feel as disappointed or insulted.  The manager heard me out and seemed very understanding at first and promised to follow up.   And, as it turned out, he never did.",1,2,0

I wouldn't even know where to start, but hands down, their creme brulee kicked ass.  My girlfriend who had creme brulees in Paris said that these were even better.  In terms of variety, this place definitely has variety.  Almost all buffets are similar to another in Vegas.  The usual seafood section, the usual asian food and american food, pastries and dessert and etc.  However, the difference in the quality and the food here by far beats out those at the other hotels like Mirage, Luxor or what not.  The only place I really have not yet compared it to would be the Bellagio buffet.  

I was disappointed that the costs was kind of pricey.  I'm not sure if it was the season prices or what not, but I remember it costing us around $40 something for each of us when we went between christmas and new years.

Don't waste your time and money at this buffet, you will not get what you paid for. 
Here are some details and I'll break it down to: if you eat everything, if you are vegetarian, vegan, or like seafood. 
If you eat everything: There aren't that many options to begin with. It's a small buffet compared to others in the area. I do not eat meat or shellfish, but it was obvious that their meat were dry and the guys were having hard time carving it ... yeah ... that dry! I overheard a couple totally disappointed by the taste of their meat dishes. 

If you eat fish and seafood: I can't tell you about shrimp and crab, because I don't eat that stuff. But their fish dishes were awful. There were three choices: One was so dry that I had to drink water with every bite. Another fish dish was so bland that I had to fix it up at my table with salt, pepper, and lemons and other things. I didn't bother trying their salmon dish, it looked totally messy. 

If you are vegan or vegetarian: you don't have that many options at all. Their salad are not fresh, the vegan veggie roll was too salty to eat, and I did not even bother trying their vegan sushi as it looked soggy and nasty. They had rice which was oily and crunchy, I think it was a day or two old. 

Their dessert: Oreo cookies! Really! For $50 of a buffet you get Oreo cookies and chocolate chip cookies. Some other options there but they all looked old and bland. I tried their chocolate lava cake and it was bitter, the apple crumble pie was so tart that it felt like taking a bite out of a green apple. It was painful. 

This was NOT worth $50 heck I wouldn't even pay $15 for such buffet.",0,2,0

It was a comp, so it's not like I was spending any of MY money, but...I still feel like it was such a waste. The food was just mediocre, nothing to call home about. The first time was great probably because of the whole ""first time at a Vegas buffet"" thing.

This was our first Wynn buffet visit.  A few years ago, we made the mistake of going to a very low end buffet at the Flamingo, one of the worst I have ever seen.  Cold food, classic day-old looking fried chicken, mashed potatoes with the ubiquitous protective dried shell, and the gravy that looks frozen-over.

The Wynn buffet was exceptional.  Don't know who created the concept of small entree portions, be it the Cosmo, Caesars Palace, or the Wynn, but it sure works for us.  

The cost for dinner on a Wednesday was $33 a person.  There was exceptional larger than normal peel and eat shrimp, a definite upgrade over traditional buffet shrimp.  The crab legs were aplenty.  There was a gourmet meat loaf, non-dried out blackened salmon, mahi mahi with grilled pineapple, sushi, ahi tuna, a great pesto pasta, etc.  You had brocolinni with apricots, a beet and orange salad, and fresh pineapple in Malibu coconut rum.  My wife enjoyed the cook to order pasta station.

EVERYTHING was warm and not dried out.  Even the mashed potatoes.  Superb desserts and exceptional service.  

The Planet Hollywood buffet is good and the Caesars buffet is very good, although the price at Caesars is high enough where you don't feel like you are getting close to your money's worth.  We haven't had the Wicked Spoon Buffet at the Cosmopolitan, but we will soon.  The buffet at the Paris buffet is good, but a little overpriced.  But, it has some foods you don't see at other buffets including a terrific crepes station.  The lines to get in there, and at Planet Hollywood, are very, very long.

How about apologizing first of all and then maybe if she cared about the reputation of the place, ask what it was that both of us ate! she didn't offer anything: apology, a chance to dine back with them in the near future..

We had so many options of where to go to dine: belaggio (so good), thought about aria, cosmopolitan, planet hollywood but decided to try something gourmet.. And chose the Wynn... 

My hubby don't remember whether or not we've eaten here so we decided to treat ourselves and was really looking forward in dinning here. For Saturday dinner it was $43.99 per person. Ok.

At 830, there was only a few customers in line.. But we didn't realize that not only did they have one cashier but 2. So we stood there patiently our turn when I glanced over to my left I see that there was another cashier and she just looked at us without calling us over. We approached her and she doesn't say a word, so I said ""for 2 please"" she tells us the total, I handed her the card and she said ""sign here.."" I did then she mumbles ""thanks"" I wished I looked at her name badge but I didn't really care at that time as I wasn't out to look for making complaints..

Good selection was ok they had, salad bar, ramen station , Asian section, seafood area, sushi, and dessert. The only fruits that they had were watermelon and pineapples. My hubby was disappointed in this. And their dessert was just okay. I guess we expected more as we love eating at bellagio..

After we left and we drove to lax nightclub, I informed my hubby that my stomach was hurting, we left headed back to our hotel and you can imagine what was being done there. We took turns and went out to get Taco Bell since it was closing in at midnight.

FOOD:  3 stars

My big complaint is a lack of variety.  

Salad Station 3 stars
When I go to salad stations at most other quality buffets there is an assortment of different vegetables; here, there was only the garden salad mixed greens, some chopped cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, and grilled chicken which I got from the Caesar salad area.   Yes, they have 3 different salads (Chinese chicken, Caesar, and garden salad), but I think buffets charging $35 a head need provide more variety than 3 vegetables and 4 dressings.  

Seafood Station:  2 stars
Once again I was disappointed by the lack of variety.  I saw shrimp cocktail with lemons and cocktail sauce, crab legs, 3 types of sushi, some smoked salmon, but I didn't see any real variety.  I would have liked to have seen a wider selection of fish options but it just wasn't happening, at least not on this particular day.  

Pasta Station 5 stars

This is not something I've seen at any other buffet.  They have a station in which there is an actual chef who will cook a pasta dish with a good selection of vegetables and sauces.  The meat selection was limited to chicken, but chicken is fine with me.   There's other pre-made pastas, but I don't get why anybody would get something pre-made when they could have something made fresh.  

Asian Station:  4 stars
They seemed to focus on Thai and Chinese dishes on this area.  The highlight was the chicken panang which was nice and spicy.  They didn't offer weak panang to cater to weak ass white people who can't handle spicy food.  That's right, I just relied on a stereotype in my review! 

Indian Station:  2 stars

How can you have an Indian section without some form of curry?  I saw 4 food options which were all vegetarian based and some naan.  The only reason I'm giving the Indian section 2 stars was that the naan was surprisingly fresh and tasty, though nowhere nearly as good as real Indian naan.   

Meat Station 4 stars

Once again there was a lack of variety.  There were 2 meats when I went, leg of lamb and some prime rib.  The leg of lamb was flavorful, juicy, and tender.  I didn't bother with the prime rib because it looked very fatty and undercooked.  I later found out that you can have the meat guy grill your cut a bit more.  

Dessert Station: 2 stars

The crepe guy ruined this area for me.  I looked at all the pics by Yelpers of crepes and saw amazing creations, but my crepe guy was completely inept.  He made my chocolate crepe look like an oil spill and when I asked for a bit of cream he plopped a giant spoonful on my crepe.    

I would have also liked some gelato, but the person running the gelato area was not present.  

Additionally, Some of the desserts weren't labeled and I didn't want to get something I didn't like and have to waste food by throwing it away.  

On the other hand, at least the dessert area had a whole lot of variety.  


SERVICE:  3 stars

Our cashier was informative about the process and even gave us the scoop on the lunch to dinner transition.  The host was nice enough.  The waiter was a bit slow on the refills, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but there are only 2 jobs for a buffet waiter - clean up plates and refill drinks.  

AMBIANCE:  5 stars

Ultimately I think the appeal of the Wynn buffet is how nice and new it is.  The entry area is beautifully decorated with these large fake fruit and flower arrangements.  There are a bunch of pics posted by other Yelpers.  

CONCLUSION:

The buffet is clean and beautiful, but I was disappointed by the lack of variety.",1,0,0

Instead they had two very simple rolls. we went on friday nite. oh I did like the king crab legs, it was sweet! never had sweet ever! usually i am not a fan of it cuz it always taste like water. 
its $50 person including tax excluding tips. another disappointment no alcohol beverages was included. we had to pay an extra $16 for unlimited wine, mimosa or bloody mary. Not worth it to me.

There are a LOT of them here, so when it comes to choosing which one (or, if you're like me, which 3) to visit while in town, that can be a tough decision.

Last week a group of about 10 of us were in Vegas and at the suggestion of two in the group, we decided to hit the Buffet at the Wynn for dinner on Friday night. My review is as follows:

PROS:
1) CLEANLINESS & FRESHNESS: Buffet lines were kept very tidy and food was turned over\/ kept fresh frequently. 

2) QUALITY & VARIETY: There were 10 different stations ranging from sea food, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, Salads, etc.... Great assortment. And the quality was good (ie. REAL mashed potatoes, not those instant crap kind, etc). Nothing I ate was unappetizing.

3) RESPONSIVE WAIT STAFF. The wait staff not only brings you your drinks and refills here, but they also clear your plates for you. Our waitress was covering a huge area, so there was a slight lull on occasion when it came to getting a refill, but generally speaking our discarded plates were taken off the table quickly, and our drinks were kept full.

These were the Pros. As for Cons, there was only one: PRICE. The cost of the buffet was +\/- $40, but in a group of 10, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to that, making the price around $50.

Now, let me emphasize here that I am not - generally-speaking- a cheapskate. I will pay good money for a great meal, no qualms about it. But here's the issue with expensive buffets: in the end, it's never really worth the money you pay for it. Lemme explain:

Everyone typically hits a buffet the same way: your first trip up, you load that plate with the stuff that REALLY looks good to you. When you sit down to eat it, you're also super-hungry, so that first plate is DELICIOUS, because you're at your most famished, eating the food you enjoy the most. Plates #2, #3, etc will NEVER be as tasty or as satisfying to you as Plate #1... And for many of us, by the end of the buffet, we're just nibbling on food because we paid for it and it's there - not because we're super-hungry and want more and more, ya know? So, you're in essence really paying for that first, best plate.

So the questions I really have to ask myself are these:

1) Was that first plate worth $50? For me, it wasn't. 

2) Could I have been just as satisfied at another buffet for less $$? Yes. Don't get me wrong - the Wynn was good. But so are a lot of other good buffets in Vegas too. I think I probably could've hit a different one $10 - $15 cheaper and left just as full\/ satisfied.

3) Could I have gotten a better, more-satisfying meal elsewhere for the money I paid to go here? Yeah, I think so. The other place I was considering for dinner was the SW Steakhouse. Not a buffet, and likely $20+\/- more than this one, but the food at SW is apparently phenomenal, so I do wish I'd checked that place out instead, and gone with a cheaper buffet.

LONG STORY SHORT: The Buffet at the Wynn is a very nice buffet. I'm just not convinced it's worth the $50 I paid to eat there. If I'm going to spend $50+ on a meal, it has to leave me going, ""Damn, THAT was GOOD!"" This place didn't. I'm glad I checked it out, but I wouldn't make it a regular stop on return trips to Vegas. It was tasty and all - but I think there are more satisfying meals to be had in Vegas for the price I paid to eat here.",2,0,0

If you read my previous review, written in 2008, I used to love the Wynn buffet. I haven't been to the Wynn buffet in a few years...pretty much since Wicked Spoon and the Bacchanal Buffet opened. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I were in town over Thanksgiving and felt nostalgic so we decided to revisit the Wynn for Thanksgiving brunch. We arrived at about 10:30 am and the line was not too long. This buffet is truly frozen in time...nothing has changed as far as the types of food offered. It is really just standard buffet food circa 2000. I got some turkey breast, slab bacon, and an eggs benedict. The turkey breast was so dry I almost choked on it. The eggs benedict was completely overcooked to the point of rubber and was completely inedible. I was honestly shocked at the awfulness of this food. My dining partner went straight for the shrimp. As soon as he sat down I could smell a strong odor of ammonia...like seafood that had gone bad. When we looked at the shrimp it was pretty obvious that he should not eat them...some had even started turning green. When my champagne arrived it was in a dirty glass...and when I say dirty, I really mean filthy. Upon further inspection all of the glass wear on the table we equally as filthy. Very frightening!!! We were both completely nauseated and revolted...the manager gave us our money back and we left.

Never again!",15,5,3

I dislike buffets because they tend to have crappier than average food, very little variety, and not a lot of things you really want. Inevitably, you pick a few things you like, most of which don't taste as good as they look, and maybe go back for seconds or thirds because you feel like you must get your money's worth.

HOWEVER, The Buffet has everything you could ask for and the food tastes positively gourmet quality as though (and probably) prepared by a master chef.

Just a few dinner highlights to mention: crab legs, prime rib, sushi of all kinds, pumpkin ravioli, gnocchi in brown butter sauce, chicken curry, scallops, pizzas with every topping you can imagine, beef brisket, Chinese dumplings, etc.

For dessert: creme br√ªl√©e, hot brownies, strawberry shortcake, mousse, assorted tarts, cookies, cheesecake, tiramisu, a crepe and waffle station, and tons of ice cream. Don't worry, there's lots more! Some of the cakes are topped with glittery sugar too, and you'll be mesmerized.

The waiters are also insanely attentive but not obtrusive. You'll never have to worry about a refill on your soda, wine, or coffee. Empty plates are taken away promptly.

1) They appear to be creating artificial queuing \/ waiting for some reason. I went on a Sunday night expecting it to be reasonably quiet, and yet we had to queue for 30-45 minutes. I was very annoyed when we finally were seated to see that so many tables were empty and clean (without word of exaggeration, 50-60% of tables were free) yet staff were forcing patrons to wait for long periods of time after paying, to be shown to a table.

2) The drinks service was terrible. We had an old miserable lady serve us, who clearly did not enjoy her job or want to be there. While I don't expect minimum wage staff at buffets to always be full of the joys of spring, if I am going to eat at one of the most high end and top priced buffets in Las Vegas, I expect them to be able to employ staff that can get a single drink order right, and actually bring you more than one coffee in an hour and a half period. 

3) What has happened to the food? While the quality is still fairly high, the problem I was having, was trying to find enough items to group together to resemble some sort of meal consisting of similar items. I have not had this problem in the past at the Wynn and have not had this problem to this extent elsewhere. For example, if you ate at a Chinese restaurant, you might order an appetiser or two, and then for your entr√©e, you might have a Chinese curry, served with lets say egg fried rice. Well at the Wynn buffet, there is no problem with a couple of appetisers, but when it comes to your entr√©e, they don't seem to be serving a curry and a rice dish at the same time, you can have a rice dish and no curry to go with it, or a curry dish and no rice. While this is not the most eloquent example, I am sure you can get my meaning.

So unfortunately Wynn buffet, after making us queue for a long time for no good reason, giving us terrible drinks service and then leaving us a little disappointed with the menu selection, I'm afraid we can no longer justify paying the premium price for a buffet that we no longer feel fits into the premium category",0,0,0

Ambiance is gorgeous....especially the garden area. Yes, it's perfect for photo ops...selfie...Instagram...all that ""fun"" stuff. 

NOTE: they're pretty strict on the dress codes. Cannot speak for the male population but us females....absolutely NO bare mid-driffs. No cropped tops of ANY KIND. Not even an inch of skin showing in your abdominal region. Thank goodness I had a cardigan in my bag. Although I found it odd that I saw a heavy set woman wearing a tube top maxi dress CLEARLY with no bra because her fun-bags drooped down to her stomach. Okay Wynn. But we're allowed to prance around in our bikinis around the casino? This is a buffet, afterall. Get off that high horse.

Food was fresh and well presented. Some of our favorites included the pizza selections (my boyfriend is a pizza snob and he loved these), the sausage selections, omelet station, chorizo, smoked salmon + capers, and my personal fav....shrimp mixed with bell peppers and onions in a tomato-y cheesy sauce. It's not jambalaya....I forgot what the name of this was. My mouth is salivating as I type this...it's THAT good. Honestly, I'm sure there's a bigger selection during lunch or dinner.

Dessert bar was....alright. I was bummed they didn't have mint n chips gelato. I've seen pictures on Yelp but their gelato flavor selections changes so don't have your heart set on just ONE flavor cuz it might not be there. I ended up trying their coconut almond joy and strawberry cheesecake gelato. My favorite was the mint grasshopper shooter. Small shot glass with layers of mint, chocolate cake topped with chocolate mousse. It tasted exactly like a Girls Scout Thin Mint cookie. I had to have two of those. Would have had three if I wasn't trying to watch my waistline. Def leave room for dessert.

Would I come back? Ehhhhh.....if I had friends\/family visiting in town and they want to come here then sure, I'll tag along. But I wouldn't go here on purpose just for the buffet again.

I do think I like the buffet brunch at The Bellagio better simply because it is larger and there is more selection. While just a tiny bit smaller and less diverse, the buffet inside The Wynn still carried incredible, top-notch quality buffet food.

Extremely hungover, I was able to force down the following:

- a candy apple (how cool is that!)
- many glasses of fresh aguas frescas (my favorite was a green one; hints of celery, apple, lemon)
- chicken noodle soup
- smoked salmon (fatty and delicious. capers and shallots on the side)
- slice of prime rib (a little dry here, I prefer the cut at The Bellagio brunch)
- one gyoza
- one chicken wing
- an arugula green apple salad
- spaghetti
- raspberry sorbet

Your brunch comes with complimentary drinks. I had a fresh-squeezed OJ, coffee, AND water. AND all those lovely aguas frescas at the buffet.

Definitely come for brunch if you are staying at The Wynn (you get to skip that awful line of crabby hungover tourists).

The food selection is wonderful and the dessert station clearly stands out.  Ice cream, cookies, carrot cake, creme brulee, chocolate desserts, etc.  At dinner, there is pasta cooked to order.  For breakfast, it is omlets cooked to order.

There is prime rib (which can be cooked more if you request), pizza, crab legs, shrimp, salad, fried chicken, fish, bread, noodles, sushi, and assorted fruits and vegetables.

Overall, the food selections were good for the money.  You can tell that they didn't corners.  The people behind the food counters were very pleasant to deal with.

The reason this didn't get 5 stars is that if you pay a 5 star price, you should be entitled to 5 star service.  We sat in the same section on back to back days and had two different waitresses.  They only had one job and that was to remove the dirty plates and keep the drinks refilled.  Once they took our drink orders and brought the drink to us, that was the last time we ever saw our waitress (Teresa and Dona).

The service was very selective and both of them went to other tables more often than ours.  It was a 7 to 1 ratio.  There is no excuse for this and we finally went up to the counter and got our own drinks as our dirty plates stacked up.  If it happens on one day, you toss it out as an anomaly.  If it happens on back to back days with different people, then perhaps, this is a new trend for the Wynn Buffet.

Their other food is ok...the sushi is pretty weak sauce..they only had 3 types of rolls (California, Salmon and Veggie).  The best thing they had was the asian section with the Pork, Leak, Shrimp thing.  They also had this bacon thing with peppercorn that was tasty too.

So got seated and ordered a pink lemonade mixed with Sprite because I was so thirsty from the desert heat. when I gulped up my first glass,m I headed towards the food. 

The way I usually eat at buffets is I'll walk around the whole area, see what they got, then mentally divide and pair up which foods I'll get together in each trip. Started off with some pasta. I love me some pasta. I got the tortellini and noticed they had a made-to-order pasta station. Oooooooh! There was a line so I decided to come back. Let's just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimps were the best of the entire buffet. The ravioli I got at the pasta station after tasted like shit. They only had 2 soup choices where other buffets have at least 4. The corn on the cob was so soggy and greasy. The selection at the Wynn buffet is so minimal. There wasn't much to eat.

I came at 10AM on a weekday since I had a free morning to check out another Vegas buffet. The decor here is what stood out to me the most, with a very bright, floral, garden theme. Service was attentive, though my server cleared my table toward the end when I wasn't actually completely done dining, which made for a very awkward moment. Granted, I was dining alone, and if you were watching my plates, I could see how it might appear that I was done.

I think this buffet is very reasonably priced, especially for a weekday lunch. It's definitely one of the more ""gourmet"" buffets, with lots of great offerings. I will say that a few items were not perfect (e.g. sushi rice grains were a bit dry), but quality still excellent overall for a buffet. They were also fairly quick to switch over to lunch items shortly after 11AM, though I was pretty full at that point so only managed to look at the offerings instead of try them.

Notable menu items: stone crab, prime rib and ribeye, and caviar.  The caviar cake on a latka, which to me destroys caviar.  But it was good quality caviar.  The prime rib was underseasoned and quite dry and I asked for medium, since apparently mid-rare isn't a thing.

The dessert was also underwhelming. They had beautiful displays, but none of what was on the display was available for consumption - I'm mainly referring to macaroons.

I was unimpressed and quite disappointed by the quality of food.  We waited in line for about 30 minutes.  For some reason the hostesses sat parties of three or more faster than parties of two, even though there were quite a few tables for two open???  

We get seated and immediately go to the buffet to try the food!  I started my dinner with a salad from their salad station located in the right-hand area of the buffet.  The assortment of fresh vegetables was limited, as was the variety of about five different dressings.  Though the vegetables and dressings were all very good.  But how the heck can you screw up your own creation of a salad?  I do give the Wynn's Buffet an extra brownie point for having freshly shaved parmesan cheese and about four different varieties of cheese slices (cheddar, brie, gouda, etc.)!  Along w\/my salad I got a roll.  It was stiff but not stale, and luke warm.  Meanwhile, my boy friend chows down on a large plate of king crab legs.  He said the crab legs were pre-steamed and served iced.  Hmm, when I think of crab legs, I think of them hot and steaming--especially for this price!  While we are chowing down our first plates, our waitress finds us to take our drink orders--two cokes.

My next trip up to the buffet I got some Asian beef & broccoli that was freshly made, and some mashed potatoes w\/turkey gravy.  I would've gotten some of the Asian pork potstickers but they didn't look too appetizing, nor did I see any soy\/ginger sauce for dipping.  Oh, I would've also gotten the carved turkey but they seemed to have run out for the entire night--and I'm not much of a prime rib person :-(.  I get back to our small table for two and start with the mashed potatoes w\/turkey gravy--pretty good!  I try my beef & broccoli...hmm...not very Asian tasting...pretty fatty and gristly (yuck).  I tried to eat as much of the broccoli as I can but, the flavor of the dish is not what I deem as an authentic Asian dish.  Both items on this dish were cool to luke warm in temperature :-(.

At this point I'm pretty disappointed in the food.  So I know if I order pasta from the pasta station it WILL BE HOT and probably pretty good, right?  I go up there to scan the variety of Italian foods...  There's only one guy in front of me getting his pasta made.  I figure, ""no sweat,"" my order will be taken promptly since there are four other stove burners to prepare pasta.  I waited there about five minutes but the chef never even said a word to me.  I was fully ready to tip him $5 for some hot pasta with some alfredo sauce!  Enough is enough...I plop some pre-made mac & cheese on my plate.  I walk by some fruit cups (with mint), grab one and go back to our table.

I get back to our table and it is totally cleared off--no silverware, no drinks, no receipt.  We didn't even tip yet and they clear off the table!  WTF!!!!  I sit down and look around for our server.  She immediately comes over and apologizes.  One of the bussers brings us new silverware and our server brings us new cokes.  Getting back to the food...  my mac & cheese was again luke warm.  The taste was average, however, I do think if it was hot, I would've said it was ""good.""  The fruit cup was fresh and had a pleasant hint of mint.  

Our last plate was dessert--creme brulee.  I really wanted to go to the Wynn's Buffet because I knew they had this there.  It was okay but,  I did not go for a second helping.

Overall, our experience at the Wynn's Buffet was less than average.  The atmosphere was nice and decadent.  There were plenty of chefs, bussers, servers to accommodate it's large clientele.  Though, I still can't believe none of these employees caught us going towards the buffet NOT the exit; thus clearing off our table!  All of the hot foods we sampled were either cool or luke warm, very disappointing.  The quality of food lacked as well.  The buffet is not worth $35 + tax a person and, I hope I can save a lot of visitors some money!

the atmosphere resembles a way upscale fresh choice full of tourists....service was kinda crappy (i really need my water refilled like every 30 seconds...just give me a damn pitcher already!).... TONS of variety...huuuuge king crab legs, sushi was disappointing, not many veggie options. however,  the dessert section was MAGNIFICENT!! bananas foster, flan, mini-cupcakes, creme brulees, little raspberry cakes, blocks of fudge, frozen yogurt, maple bars, eclairs...ohh just so many things to indulge in!!....it probably took us 25 mins to eat dinner, about 45 for dessert (i insisted on trying at least one bite everything, so i had to take breaks in between rounds), and then another 15 of just sitting still passing in and out of a food comatose at the table.

my overall reaction to a vegas buffet: i would rather take that $40 and order ONE fabulous meal, drinks & dessert at a fantastic restaurant OFF of the strip!! (see vintner grill)",2,0,1

We have been going to Spice Market since the Aladdin Casno and have had good and great experiences but never a bad one.  Have been to other buffets as well but never the Wynn.  We decided to try it out given the good reviews.  

We arrived and it was busy but the line moved at a reasonable speed. After trying to call multiple times we thought the cost would be the $25 for lunch as listed on many sites but discovered they consider Jan 2nd a holiday and jacked up the price to $40 for ""Brunch"" and $60 for dinner.  After waiting in line for an hour brunch was 30 min from ending and the dinner transition so we thought it would be worth it getting dinner items as well.  

As we feared, Brunch is not a special menu but an excuse to replace unique dishes with simple breakfast foods.  Every station had some cheap version of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns obviously in place of themed items on regular menu.  The Eggs Benedict (with smoked Salmon) looked promising but the muffin was so stale I couldn't cut it, the egg over very hard and the Hollandaise so dried out it was no longer liquid.  Salads were pathetic and wilting and seafood section was dismantled a full 20 minutes before the transition leaving it empty for that period.  Carving station had only old turkey and no prime rib for over a half hour and no server for most of it.  

Finally the dinner entrees were served and look promising but ultimately disappointing.  Snapper, Sea Bass and Salmon all rubbery and flavorless.  Oysters not fresh, grab legs ok but they wouldn't steam them for those of us that prefer them that way.  Asian station was a poor imitation of a panda express with mediocre chicken stir fry and sticky buns filled with what appeared to be butternut squash instead of a pork or other filling.  Pot stickers with no Gyoza sauce, just soy sauce in packets?!  

Dessert crepes filled with creamy cheese were tasty and the ice cream was very good but the rest of pastries were mostly perfunctory additions to an otherwise bland station.  

After speaking to the manager we left understanding the poor experience. Not the service you would expect from an establishment purported to be ""classy"".  She explained they can't post signs at the entrance or update the website to reflect the ""many"" holidays throughout the year when they decide to jack up the prices and drop all pretense of quality.  I offered to provide them with the name of a few capable web masters but alas that would be too great a task for this little operation to take on...",6,1,0

They were very slow at moving the line and the staff were not very forthcoming or putting forward good customer service. Then, it took forever for them to run a credit card because they said there was some sort of computer issue. Rather than take the cards and process the charges later like other restaurants would do, they were manually calling in 1-by-1 each person trying to pay. There was then an additional wait to get brought to a table. For a dinner that costs almost $50, this poor service is certainly not expected. Once at a table, though, someone quickly took a drink order and plates did get cleared in a timely manner. The food was overall good. Meatballs were very good. Seafood selection was good with oysters, cocktail shrimp, and crab legs. They had good carved meats, and good Asian-style dishes. Mac & cheese was excellent. Sushi was mediocre, though.

As buffets go, The Buffet at the Wynn is top notch.  The only other buffet that compares is the Bellagio.  I haven't been to Studio B at the M Resort but from what I've read 1)  They don't offer King Crab Legs (only snow crab)  and 2)  Their seafood buffet is only for the weekends where as the Wynn's high class offerings are DAILY.

I started with a plateful of King Crab Legs which are already split in half for you and some P&D shrimp cocktail.  The crab legs were tasty and not salty at all as some have complained.  They have a bunch of different salad offerings plated in individual shot glasses.  I tried the Thai Beef Salad which was excellent.  They have a limited sushi selection which I did not try mainly because I wasn't in the mood for sushi.  Their prime rib was delicious and cooked to perfection.  I asked for and received a perfect medium rare slice.  They can cut a slice from any doneness that you prefer.  The Sea Bass was delicious as was the Risotto.  Truthfully almost all the offerings were delicious and there was so many different options that I forgot what I had.  What I do remember is Osso Bucco, Jerk Chicken, Mahi Mahi, Snapper, etc.  They also have a pasta station with made to order pastas, plenty of different pizza offerings, and a varied selection of Ceviches.

They also had a decent offering of desserts.  Fresh made crepes were available as well ice cream (not self serve soft serve, they actually scoop it for you)  The only problem was I was stuffed by the time it came to dessert and was only able to try a few of their options.  Offerings included Tiramasu, Creme Brulee, fruit tart cups, etc.

Overall it was well worth the price tag.  You can find buffets with more items on their menu at a lower price but only at the Wynn or Bellagio will you find such high end items done right.  You can't compare.  As they say, ""You get what you pay for!",5,0,1

The have small cute desserts in sample portions, which is smart! you can try as much as you want.

I went there on a Saturday night, so I believe the prices are bumped up over the weekends. Expect to pay $41 per person. No senior discounts, since my mom qualified. Boo! Was it worth it? Ummm... I'm a vegetarian, so NO. But this dinner was not for me, it was for my mama. My mom liked it and she would go back if the prices were reasonable. 

The setup was all right. I guess you can say it was setup more like a cafeteria style, where you get in line and wait for people to get their food. There were a variety of cuisines to choose from. So food-wise, there was a lot! Okay, so now to the desserts. I was excited when I saw that they make fresh crepes. I had the chef make me one, and I was not satisfied. It was horrible.

The prime rib was quite good though.

The salads looked great, the tomato bisque was delicious, the sausages were also worth noting.

The lasagne was too quite tasty, and maybe the closest thing worth going back for.

The sushi I skipped at the recommendation on many others here and after looking at it I can see why.

The civiche options were okay but not amazing.  The crab legs were okay, but being cut already in half makes it look\/feel like there is way less meat and it's really hard to ever feel like you got a lot.  The drawn butter was not even warm...how is that possible!?
The shrimp was fantastic, but how hard is it to make something raw taste like it should?

After we ordered our drinks I decided to go take a look at the food selection. When I got into the food area I was pleasantly surprised. They had the biggest selection of food I have ever seen at a buffet. I ended up trying everything. It took me four full plates to accomplish this. Everything was absolutely amazing. The crab legs where the freshest I have ever seen or tasted. The pasta bar had many types of sauces and pastas to choose from. All the different meats (prime rib, sirloin, etc) where all cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. Then after all those plates I decided to hit up the dessert section. I swear to you when I walked into that room I felt I had died and gone to heaven. They have so many items to choose from. Again I tried everything. I had homemade donuts, creme brulee, a big and moist cupcake, and more but the best things were the crepes that they make fresh right in front of you. 

Our server was perfect. Even though he was in charge of a very large area he managed to never let our drinks get half full.

However, this visit fell short of par as the waitress would forget our drink orders (didn't you just write them down?), disappear for long stints and then reappear with an option I didn't ask for (tabasco when I kindly asked for cholula). 

We came as a large group and as a result had to wait a bit longer than other (smaller) parties to be seated, even though we had clearly mentioned and stated that we wouldn't mind separating. Minor annoyance, but at the end of the day it's all about attention to detail! 

I've only ever come for breakfast\/lunch\/brunch spread, and never for dinner so I have no hints to how the service\/spread is then, but with the Wynn standards, I'm reassured that it trumps most of what the strip has to offer. 

Favorites (worth going back for seconds for) were: 
* Chinese Congee
* Green beans! 
* Dumplings

As I discussed in my other review for the Wynn overall, my experience is one of extreme privilege, as my friend received a GREAT deal for free over here. This also means we got to cut to the front of the line, and the buffet was comped. It looked expensive for everyone else though, haha.

*From a vegan's perspective

Price: C- ($$)
The $45\/ person price tag is probably a steal for meat eaters, maybe even vegetarians. Crab legs, oysters, prime rib, sushi, fried chicken... I could go on. But maybe not entirely worth it for a vegan. If you can justify the price for the experience rather than actual food consumption you might have an easier time shelling over the cash.

Variety: B-
There was a decent amount of vegan options at best. For all the hype, from vegan bloggers, you would've thought they had tons of options. Salad bar was minimal and there wasn't a single vegan soup, even the minestrone had meat. Lots of Asian (typical) and they had vegan spring rolls... um YUM! But you'd think they would have taken advantage of some quick wins. Street taco station but no tofu or veggie options! They did have some veggie dishes, roasted carrots, broccoli rabe, etc. But again, missed out on some quick wins for vegan's, why not leave the bacon OFF the veggie dish? They did have 3 options for vegan dessert though, assorted sorbet, a soy-based ice cream, and a vegan passion fruit tapioca parfait. Nothing chocolate or baked. Bummer. 

Quality: A
While there wasn't a ""buffet-load"" of options for vegans, the food we did eat was delicious. I mainly stuck to the same few items and ate just enough to feel satisfied that I somewhat got my money's worth but didn't hate myself for it. My plates consisted of veggie lo mien, vegan spring rolls, spicy green bean and tofu, veggie sushi, Spanish rice (I love me some rice), and a spring pea salad. For dessert: one parfait (it was miniature) and a small scoop of soy mint chocolate chip ice cream.

Informational: C-
I know Steve Wynn doesn't personally oversee the Wynn Buffet food labeling, but being a vegan you'd think he would appreciate the importance of labeling food. It appeared as if they started the process of identifying allergens or calling out vegan options and then decided to quit halfway through. There would be one label that specially called out Dairy and then another right next to it that had nothing in the name that would explicitly make a person assume it had dairy and no dairy label, but when I asked the attendant they said it had butter. There would be a few items that said vegan on the label and then others that would be (or at least very much appear to be) that would NOT be labeled vegan. All or nothing , I say... Because if you only label some things I'm scared to eat anything that's not labeled vegan. And as much as I would've loved to devour at plate of vegan spring rolls and vegan passion fruit parfait... I have to assume that the lettuce and other salad options were vegan as well. If not, what did you do the lettuce? 

Overall: B-
If you're looking for a ""Vegas buffet"" experience, I'd say it's a good options for vegans. If you're looking for great vegan food, I'd say you're better off going to one of the many great restaurants that while not offering a wide selection, have fantastic vegan (or easily made vegan, vegetarian) food.",5,2,2

I've eaten the breakfast buffet at the Wynn 6 times now and it's been great every time. Simply put -- it's the King of the Buffets in Vegas. Only $19.95 during the week...a deal that can't be beat. The quality is always at least good at a minimum and usually very good or better. The selection is huge! The service is usually excellent, which is rare for a buffet.

Update: back again today for breakfast. I hit the buffet jackpot today. Everything I typically get at this buffet was hot and fresh...they literally were putting in fresh food right before I went to each item. Needless to say it was great....fresh eggs, tasty lightly crisp bacon, excellent sausage, and the little hash browns are amazing!!!! Who knew hash browns could taste this good. 

I read a lot of negative comments in these reviews about various restaurants, complaining about how overpriced the meals are. Well, I'm here to tell you The Buffet at the Wynn is not one of those places. Considering what I ate, it's a much better deal than my local breakfast place is. Plus it's at the Wynn, the decor is off the charts and I'm in Vegas. This gets my highest recommendation for a buffet anywhere.

Buffets are what they are.  You can eat a lot of food for a good price. The compromise is there will always be some variance in quality depending on the timing of when they put down a fresh pan\/bowl of food. If you arrive right after that, you've hit the jackpot. If you get to the station after the food item has been there a while and there's not much left, you're gonna find is not hot and it might be dried out a bit. Take a temporary pass and wait til they fill it up again. If you always want fresh then go to a regular place and order from the menu.",0,0,1

Here you can overindulge feeling classy all the while you are stuffing your gut with their huge assortment of food. Asian? Check. Mexican? Check. Italian? Check. American? Check.

There are fresh salads, soups, lots of meats, various egg dishes, a made-to-order omelet station, ham carving station, stir fry woks, pizzas, etc. etc. You'll discover something new with every trip to the food spreads. 

Secret tip: Be smart like us and get there around 10-10.30am. That way you can have all the breakfast options and then at 11am when they start serving lunch you can have a whole new buffet spread to choose from (and you only paid the brunch price). Pure indulgence. Food coma will ensue. Get the $10 bottomless champagne\/mimosas to swish all that food down.

Lastly, a trip to the dessert display can never be avoided. This is my favorite part of any buffet. Who doesn't like little dessert concoctions served in shot glasses and mini pie slices on small plates? The Buffet at Wynn outdoes themselves every time on the desserts. Marshmallows on a stick dipped in white\/milk\/dark chocolate sprinkled with crunchy chopped nuts and rainbow sprinkles. Candied apples. Ice cream. Pastries. Fruit tartlets. Cakes. Pies. Mousses. Cookies. Eclairs. Beignets. *SIGH* everything a sweet tooth could ever want is waiting right here for you. My favorites were the rocky road cake and the mint mojito pie.",11,9,8

I saw people coming back with piles of crab legs on their plates. I wouldn't OD on shellfish on a vacation. You never know. Little did we know that we were going to pay for that greasy breakfast at BB Kings.

If you try, you can see they are trying hard to save money while still looking classy but you have to be drunk or drunk on thinking you must be a high class person if you are eating here.  This buffet would satisfy insecure people who want to feel classy or wealthy but can't see behind the dress of everything that what they are being served should make them feel insulted.  If you come here you will definitely find something big to be disappointed in.

Their creme brulee, omg... it's like orgasm in your mouth.

Take my advice, stop by here on your last day in Vegas, because you'd want to eat and stuff yourself and get your money's worth, and by doing so, I doubt you'll be able to fit into your clubbing dress after, so if I were you, I'd eat here on my last day in Sin City, because I know I don't have to worry about trying to fit into my clubbing dress later that night, haha.",14,12,12

Also I loved their king crab legs- fresh not too salty...just so tasty and so finger lickin good with some lemon and a dip in that warm butter. I was also surprised that I liked the lamb. Im not a lamb person but theirs were cooked perfectly and not gamey at all. I was even impressed that they had a panang station where you order what ingredients you want to add in your panang and that they offer tandoori and naan bread.

We went for dinner on saturday night and I was extremely disappointed in the food. The selection was good, but the execution of the food was not. Everything was dry and tasted like it has been sitting for hours. 
The first thing I had was the crab legs and the shrimp cocktail. Both were good, however, kind of hard to mess those up. I also had the Jonah crab claws which weren't too good and didn't taste like others I've had. 
Next up, i went for the fish. I tried the lemongrass seabass, the atlantic salmon and another fish (sorry, forgot the name). The only one of the three that tasted good was the seabass. The others were again, dry, and also tasted very 'fishy.' 
On my third trip, I tried the meats. The beef ribs were dry as well as fairly fatty. The five spice chicken was dry as well, although had decent flavor. The best thing I had all night was the grilled tomahawk rib eye. Great seasoning and great taste. However, another person in my group said his cut was very fatty. 
Overall, the sweets were very good, I had an apple crepe that was very good, the chocolate lava cakes were great, the guava panna cotta was tasty, the cheesecake was good, and the mango sorbet was also good. I would however warn against the brownies, very hard and not enjoyable.

Brunch without bottomless glass of mimosa or Bloody Mary was $37 per person. We arrived around 11am and was told it was an hour wait. I had friends rave that it's the best buffet in Vegas...so we waited. It was more like an hour and a half before we were seated. 

The decor is lovely with colourful (albeit fake) flowers and the room is very bright with natural light. 

I started with breakfast foods. Eggs Benedict was good, but I prefer the Bellagios hollandaise. Omelette made to order was the best part of the breakfast selections. Weirdly no type of breakfast potato or hash brown. (Actually now thinking back no potatoes of any kind at the carving station either). There was a fruit and yogurt bar for lighter choices and interesting little carafes of juices like watermelon ginger.

Returned to the table to find juice and coffee. OJ was fresh. Coffee not so much. 

For the lunch options I tried their roast beef. The carver was spaced out and I had to ask repeatedly for a med-rare piece. He first placed well done on my plate without looking at me or listening to what I was saying. The piece I got was pretty good. I also tried their charcuterie board that had some nice salami and pickles.

By the time we got to the dessert station we were too full to enjoy. There is a homemade ice cream bar and lots of little pastries.

The Italian Ziti and fried chicken were lackluster. Highlights were korean pancakes, gourmet tacos, Korean ribs, and the seafood selection. There also was Peking duck, which I've yet to see at any other buffet so far.

The service was very good. Our waiter stopped by routinely to gather old plates and refill drinks. The tables are a bit close together, so expect to weave in and out of a crowd to get to the buffet or back to your table.

Desserts were diverse - but only the cheesecake and Thai tea in a cup really stood out to me flavor wise. I liked the crepe station and candied apples.

We went at about 1pm and stood in line for a hour before we were seated. The trick is to go after 2pm for the lunch buffet and watch them switch over to the dinner buffet at 330pm.

The food was good, but I'm usually a buffet owner's dream: I dont eat shellfish and I dont eat a ton of meat. More so after a night of drinking when all I want is soup and noodles. One plate of a variety of foods from the heavier buffets, two plates of salad and two bowls of soup, finishing off with 2 small servings of dessert.

Before visiting Vegas, the husband did a little research for vegan options and found that this place would actually have more options than just iceberg lettuce.  I guess it helps that the Wynn owner is vegan himself.  
I was skeptical so when I arrived I asked one of the staff members if there really were vegan options since I didn't see any signs that read ""Vegan"" on anything other than one salad dish.  The staff member was so kind and assured me that there was plenty of options, she then offered to have the chef come out and let me know what exactly was vegan.  I waited for about a minute for the head chef to come out from the kitchen.. and what I thought would happen was that he'd read me a list or just name off some veggie dishes.  I was surprised that he actually walked me to EVERY station and pointed out what was vegan or what could be made vegan- yes MADE fresh to order!!  Tacos, ramen, penne pasta, ravioli, and pizza are just a few of the options that can be made vegan fresh to order!  He let me know that all I had to do was let someone on the other side of the station know what I'd like and to request that it be made vegan. 

I was so excited I didn't know where to start... but I decided to start at salads and work my way down until I got to dessert.  Yes, vegan dessert!  And not just one simple fruit cup option, but about 5 options that included candy apples, chocolate chip cookies, ice cream, and more!

When I got to the pasta station I ordered the vegan ravioli which took about 5min to make so I continued with the food I had on my plate while I waited.  When I say that the ravioli was the best I've ever had, that I actually had two servings and that I still think about it almost daily- I'm not joking!  its was sooooo delicious!

Just about everything that I tried was amazing... minus the vegan ramen option and the tacos.  In my opinion, the ramen broth was extremely bland and the noodles were overcooked.  Still, I appreciated that they have the option!  I ordered a taco with a vegan ""meat"" option but I was only able to take one bite- one because it tasted and had similar texture way too much like real meat fat which most people might like but it's not my thing.  They do also offer tofu so next time I'll definitely try that instead.  It also came to my attention after that one bite that the ""meat"" might actually be made on the same exact grill as all other meats- making it NOT vegan!!  I wasn't able to confirm because I think there was a communication\/ knowledge issue but if you do choose to order tacos, just make sure they know not to make them on the same grill.

Dessert was probably my next favorite thing after the ravioli.  I don't know if the flavors change frequently but that day they had a chocolate cherry soy ice cream that was one of the best vegan ice creams I've ever had!  it was creamy and not icy.  It had just enough flavor\/ not too sweet or lacking flavor.  I also enjoyed the red candy apples- they were small apples which was great since we were able to share it and nothing went to waste!  
My favorite dessert was the chocolate chip cookies, I could not get enough!  They were perfectly soft yet had a little crunch and not too much or too little chocolate, just right.
There was a couple of other pudding options but I didn't get to try those out since I stuck to the cookies! haha

They also offer select bottomless alcohol drinks for about $20 additional per person which I thought was great.

My one and only complaint is that this buffet had a 2hr time limit which I think is a reasonable time frame BUT I do think it should start once you're actually seated rather than when you pay! 
We arrived around 4pm and paid rather quickly but there were a few larger groups of people before us waiting to be seated.  There were plenty of empty tables but the wait to be seated was surprisingly long.  We did over hear one hostess mention to another party that they were short a hostess so there was only one girl running back and forth seating everyone.  We waited nearly 30min to be seated!  With waiting that long to be seated and then waiting for a few dishes to be made, time went by quick, and our server was sure to (rudely) let us know that we were approaching our time limit and that our drinks ordered would be our last.  Some of us hadn't even made it to dessert yet!

Even though the initial wait was long and our server wasn't the best (for quite some time we didn't even know who our server was), it doesn't ruin the quality of service we received from everyone else or the quality of food!

I've only been to one other buffet before, at the Bellagio, and I prefer that one over the Wynn. We went on a Tuesday night, after a long day of hiking at Zion National Park, so we were starving. To be honest, I didn't feel like the buffet was that big. I went back 2 times for a heaping of crab legs & shrimp cocktail, which are the only foods I really enjoyed there. They have some dim sum like dumplings and such at the Chinese food station, which was awful. Most of their cooked fishes were overcooked and not impressive. Their cheese ravioli in their pasta section was good, as was their miso soup.

They have a huge dessert section, but to be honest, none of the desserts really impressed me. One of my dining companions loved their coffee ice cream, as he is a big fan of coffee and it tastes very very strongly of coffee.

I would not go to their dinner buffet again. Also, it is very pricy, comes to about $37 with tax per person. A friend of mine said their breakfast buffet was great though, and only $25, so would be willing to try that sometime.",0,0,0

Unfortunately, I lost!!! boo! I gave up after my bf shook his head and covered his face embarrassed. hehehe

I love this buffet. I had both brunch and dinner here on several occasions; never left disappointed. 

Dinner starts at 3:30: go for the sea bass in the cooked seafood section. I come here for their sea bass primarily. It's like butter and doesn't taste fishy. Snow crab legs, plenty of them and they're cut for easy eating. Their Italian, Asian and American is very tasty. 

Brunch: It's a little pricey for brunch but it's worth every penny! I was a fan of their bake salmon and red snapper. Go for their desert section, it's most impressive!

I ate much more than what I listed. I just can't remember all of it since I had a food coma every single time. Next visit, I will take pictures and share.

That also means you're going to hit some items that you won't fancy but that's one of the things that a buffet is all about.

- The Kansas City ribs blew. They weren't tender and it was cold! 
- Their N.E. Clam Chowder on the other hand rocked. 
- Their sushi selection was decent but there's not much.
- The mini waffles were awesome! Try different toppings.
- The hot coffee is strong
- I give the desserts an A for looks but the taste, a C+. Don't waste your time on the madeleines. Failure! 
- The Chinese congee (porridge) has a lot of toppings but it's really bland so you're probably going to add soy sauce.
- They had large shrimp cocktails but no crab legs.
- I was too full for the prime rib so I can't help you there.

I finally made it to The Buffet after many years of being enticed and lured by the tales of its seductive spread of food. After checking in to the room at Wynn, my buddy and I were given with a pair of complimentary admission to either breakfast or lunch at this place (we had a special deal). And, boy, was I glad we didn't have to pay for what we got. For a regular price of $40ish bucks a head, I honestly felt like there wasn't enough variety of food present. And for the dishes that were offered, most weren't all that impressive in their quality. Presentation, however, was a solid 5-star. I was blown away by the cutesy baskets of fish and chips, triangle plates of the hamachi crudo, and all the desserts that were beautifully crafted at their stations. But what's the point of having fancy looking food when the taste is sub-par? It's rather shallow of an experience, wouldn't you think? My fish and chips were rather difficult to eat since the batter was hard to bite into and the meat of the fish was pretty thick. The hamachi crudo was pretty overwhelming in the flavor of the ponzu sauce. Not sure if that was an intentional attempt to hide the fishy taste but I felt like it could've been so much better had the sauce been more subtle. Oyster tasted old, which isn't that surprising given that Nevada isn't right next to the ocean. What I loved, though, were the juices and the dessert cones. It's refreshing to have the mango pineapple juice along with my meal, and the raspberry and coffee cones were a cherry on top of my experience. I also loved that they offered congee along with pieces of thousand year old eggs and Chinese-styled fried dough. Tastewise, the congee was rather plain. Once some salts were added, they were pretty decent. I have mixed feelings about whether I'd return here. Perhaps breakfast isn't the best time to go to The Buffet, so maybe I'll swing by for their lunch dinner next time.",0,0,0

And no one in my family felt like the $49.95 each was worth the aftermath. 

We came unknowingly during their holiday schedule pricing, which meant that they had two time segments: pre-1pm at $39.95, and $49.95 for everyone afterwards (adult pricing). At a 1.5 hour wait, it wasn't as bad as it could have been and we got in around 3pm. But because The Buffet has been rated consistently in the top Vegas buffets, our expectations were way higher. My family also lived in Vegas during the reign of the Rio buffet - where are the days of $30 for unlimited lobster tail?

The seating and atmosphere seems pretty and spacious enough. Soft drinks, juice, and drip coffee are included with your meal. At an additional $16, you can get all you can drink beer and wine from the options provided. 

Alright, food:
The Good
- Sea bass, game hen, prime rib
- Surprisingly, the Asian section (try their BBQ pork buns)
- Desserts (Crepes made to order! Gelato! Cakes! Cookies! Panna cotta! Fruit! But sadly no creme brulee...)
- Restocking happened fairly quickly

The Disappointments
- Skinny crab legs (they're cut in half for convenience, but would be scrawny even when whole) and a small seafood section in general
- Ramen noodle bar (What is this tiny bowl? And why don't I get to decide what goes in it?) 
- Most of the soups and the crab legs were monstrously salty. Felt like I was being made to eat less and fill up on water. 
- Just meh selection in general (international cuisine buuut, no particularly unique dishes of note)

There are bathrooms located behind the dessert area within the buffet which you can frequent without fear of being let back inside. There were only four stalls in the women's bathroom and timing is really everything - you might arrive when it's completely empty or you'll be atoning for your last plate while in line. At least the stall doors have a ""Vacant\/Occupied"" switch so you don't have to peel to see if someone's really behind that door.

For something advertised as a ""holiday special"", I felt really let down. I'm glad that at least the meal ended on a sweet note with the extensive desserts, but was the meal worth the wait and the price?

Since I had money to spend and being that it was Father's Day weekend, I wanted to take my parents out to somewhere nice and somewhere they haven't tried. 

We ran across Wynn Hotel & Casino and wanted to try something new. The entrance to the buffet is kind of hidden from the main gambling area, but there are signs that are helpful to find it. We arrived around 6:30pm, which we knew it was a little late, but we didn't expect it to take 1 hour to get seated. 

Once we paid and got to the hostess, we were seated fairly quickly. The waitress that took our drink order was very prompt in refilling and taking our plates from our table. 

The food was not salty like most buffets that I've been to. The crab legs were seasoned just right. The prime rib was very soft and tender except that it was a little under cooked for me. It was a little more on the rare side and I like my steak medium. It's just preference. Other then the food, the creme brulee was not too thick and had just the right amount of caramelized top. The fruits were fresh as well. 

I would definitely go back when I win some more money.  ^_~

So, if you're going to eat at this place: 
1. Arrive Early 
2. Bring lots of money because it was like $38.90 per person 
3. Make sure you make room in the tummy for some yummy",0,0,0

The crab legs are cold, icy cold with chunks of ice on top of it. Looks like they just came out of the freezer & just starting to defrost. It tastes exactly like frozen produce & not at all tasty. The sushi station is pathetic; I tried the salmon sushi & could hardly taste any salmon. The Peking Duck bun is a joke, a wafer thin roasted duck skin in a bun filled with hoisin sauce. I actually had to open the bun to locate the roasted duck skin. It's so minute that it's almost invincible to the naked eye.

The food was good, but there wasn't really any one dish we just had to
go back for.  And there are NO king crab legs.  They did have some very thin crab legs of a kind I've never heard of, but so little meat in them, just wasn't worth it.  The desserts were all very small, in little cups, so if you wanted more, you had to make a lot of trips back.  But there was nothing chocolate!  Come on!  
Here's the real reason for the 2 stars.  The emergency siren, lights and recording came on about a security breach, with a repeating message about they're looking into a problem.  We all wondered what was going on, was there a tornado, a bomb, what?  It made us all uneasy, but no employees went around to say anything, nor did they no anything when asked.  It finally stopped after about 10-15 minutes.  But oops, here we go again.  So for our entire time there, this annoying loop of flashing lights, siren and recording went on and off.  No explanation, no apologies.  It ruined our birthday meal, as we had no idea if we were in danger or what the heck was going on.
I called the Wynn buffet when we got back home to ask what if was all
about, and spoke to a very snooty gentleman who kept informing me that they are a 4 star hotel who look out for the safety of their clientele, but made no apology and really had nothing else to say to me.  
I called the next day and spoke to someone else, who said it was the fire dept. doing a safety check (during dinner time on a weekend), and they had no control over it.  I asked why did it keep gong for over an hour?
Why didn't you say it was just a dry run, like the EBS does?  She again
made no apologies and said they had no control over what the fire dept.does in their hotel.
I guess I just wanted someone to acknowledge the annoying inconvenience of our experience, but no way.  After spending $270.00
for our buffet dinner, I had hoped for someone to just give me the time

Once at the table we were treated by an extremely sweet server. I can't remember her name for the life of me but she was great. 

The 4 of us are all seafood lovers so we started out at the crab leg station. There was sushi, crab legs, and shrimp and we all began with a mix of all 3. The crab legs were great. They're already cracked open for you so it makes it extremely easy to eat. Stay away from the butter if possible, it's sooo salty. 

I then ventured off to the hot items. I had a little bite of truffle mashed potatoes, roasted cauliflower, ribeye, and a Caesar salad. All were great, the ribeye wasn't anything to rave about and I wouldn't eat it again but I'm kind of a steak snob :) 

Then the desserts... As if I didn't gain enough LBs over the holidays lol. We tried the creme br√ªl√©e, tiramisu, and a red velvet cupcake. The cupcake won for sure. It was perfect.

Sure there were 3-4 selections from regions like Asia, Italy, The south, seafood, salads and desserts.

everything was stale and cold and lacked the flavor punch that I would expect from a $35 pp breakfast buffet.

Oh yeah, and there's other food too....

For $38!!  What a deal!

We got there about 9pm which I thought would be late and uncrowded for dinner, but there was still a line!  (The city that never sleeps, am I right?)  We waited about 15 minutes and were seated at a cute little table for two.

Me and my BF had planned way before we ever set foot in Vegas that we would eat here, but eat ONLY CRAB for maximum enjoyment and value.  As such, we quickly scanned the buffet lines for anything that looked worthwhile...I picked up a few pieces of sushi for carbs...he got some prime rib...and bee-lined straight to the crab station!  We piled high a full plate of crab legs each, poured ourselves some hot melted butter, and took an additional plate for all the shells.

Now the FANTASTIC thing about THESE crab legs from THIS buffet is not only that they're Alaskan King Crab....but they're also pre-sliced, in half, down the middle.  That means no shelling, cracking, digging, biting, griping, complaining, etc.

And we feasted!  And when we were finished, we went back to the buffet for another heaping plate of crab legs each, and of course, more hot butter.  When we got back to our table we noticed that our dirty plates had been cleared away!  Yay for service!  And we feasted some more!

I don't have to explain how delicious the crab was because everyone already knows.  I will say, however, that the sushi was nothing special, and anything else that my BF tried at the buffet he described as mediocre.  CRAB is the only way to go here, baby!

In the end, my BF went to get some desserts, while I basked in all my crab-eating glory and relished the final taste of crab and butter in my mouth.  No dessert required for me!  We tipped generously and left on our merry way, happy, beyond satiated, and ready to swear off crab for a full month.",10,10,6

I will say that I had what might have been the best dessert of my life here.  It was simple, but perfectly made and I highly recommend trying it:  The mint chocolate mousse.  The texture was perfect, the amount of mint was perfect, and the chocolate complimented the mousse perfectly.  The other desserts were pretty good.

For Sunday brunch ($34.58), the Fried Brown Rice with Edamame, Steamed Pork Buns, and Maple Bacon at the carving station were highlights.  I even appreciated the Mini-Waffles that had smaller-sized grooves that give a much better texture than the more usual quarter-Belgian waffle (such as the one at Bacchanal).  A major disappointment was the lack of any version of Eggs Benedict, somewhat surprising as breakfast the next day at Terrace Point Cafe featured a trio of of Eggs Benedict variations.  The puff pastry in the Bacon and Sweet Pea Tart lacks any fluffiness, and while Waffle Batter Fried Chicken sounds like an incredible idea, it does not translate into any particularly distinctive taste.  A regular piece of fried chicken would have been much better.  The Bakery\/Dessert area--almost easy to miss even though it's at the center of the buffet--had a halfway decent oversized Croissant (the same that is served at Terrace Point and the Encore Lobby lounge for breakfast).

Dinner seemed to be even more limited in terms of available choices.  The distinctive  characteristic of the Wynn buffet is the increased use of food stations (i.e., where somebody prepares and\/or serves you food).  I liked the Roast Duck Bun station, but not the Gelato Ice Cream Sandwich Station (where the cookies were much too hard and the gelato much too soft to really maintain any semblance of sandwich form).  I did appreciate the carving station, where I asked for a thick cut of prime rib and was surprisingly rewarded with a 1.25"" cut of meat.

Overall, The Buffet at Wynn is not an overly terrible place to eat.  You'll still get a lot of food and relatively acceptable service from the waitstaff.  Also, the line at The Buffet seemed a lot more reasonable than I've experienced at the other casino resorts.  But having dined at some of those other buffets, The Buffet at Wynn is a classic Yelp 2-star ""Meh.  I've experienced better.",0,0,0

There was a short line, about 15 minutes, but by the time I got to the cashier there was a LOONNGGGG line. I think everyone was trying to pay breakfast prices before 11am lunch price kicked in!

I loved the ambiance, so many flowers, bright and airy. I was seated near the buffet, kind of in the back, which was fine with me. Often when I eat alone I notice a lack of service, and this was no different. If I'd had better service I'd have given this a 5 star rating. I had to ask for a water refill, which I hate, and had to move my dirty plates to the other side of the table since they weren't being cleared. I didn't go for the ""bottomless"" drinks and I was glad, since I doubt I'd have had better luck getting those refilled!

There aren't as many choices on this buffet as at the Bacchanal, but hands down this buffet was better! And for half the price! Every single item was presented beautifully and tasted great. The salt and pepper calamari was divine. Loved the pancakes made to order on a big rotating griddle. Lots of breakfast and lunch options. The hashbrown squares were probably some of the best potatoes I've ever had on a buffet.

I gave the buffet a quick rundown to scan the food before I dived in. I was surprised with a ramen Bar which was cool even thigh I didn't try it. I didn't come to Vegas to eat ramen, pizza or Mac n cheese and a salad. 

I'm not really into seafood but I gave the crab legs, shrimp and oysters a go. They were okay to me but what do I know. 

I'm a meat and carb girl so I loaded up on the protein. I had prime rib, ribs, sausages, veggies, potatoes, made my own meat cheese plate and sampled the Italian section. 

I was satisfied. I don't see why the buffet gets so many low reviews? The food was delicious and I sampled a little of everything. 

They had a salad bar, meat cheese section, Asian, Hispanic, seafood, and American choices as well as a Dessert Bar.

They also had Chilean sea bass, which is usually really good if it's seasoned and cooked well. This one was just alright. It was cooked well, but unfortunately was not seasoned the best. I added a little salt and it was fine.

I also enjoyed their grilled veggies in the Mediterranean section. Although the eggplant was slightly oily, they were grilled and seasoned to perfection. I loved them!

Lamb: No good. I was bummed. It wasn't overcooked, but the flavor was just not there. They game taste was overpowering, which leads me to believe that the meat is not fresh or the meat was prefrozen.

Pastas were quite good, but who wants to fill their stomachs up with pasta at a $40 buffet?

Desserts were just alright. The bananas flambe didn't look too appetizing. I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of creme brulees actually. BUT their ice creams surprisingly very very tasty. They had a choice of pineapple, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lemon yogurt. I tried pineapple and vanilla and the ice cream was so smooth and tasted very good. 

I would definitely come back.",2,1,0

Yes I am a foodie and live for buffets in Sin City everyone has a buffet the 7-eleven has a hot dog buffet. 

I like this one because of three things: 1. the food is fresh, 2. the food is cooked at the chefs station not in some secret kitchen somewhere behind the dumpster! and 3. there a endless supply of all things food! 

This is the best buffet on the strip by a long shot. They have a variety of cuisines to choose from all made fresh. My favorite was the Asian food station, fresh sushi, noodles and stir fry dishes also there was no one wok Johnny at this place all cooked on the spot. 

They also have a good selection of sea food either raw or cooked. The desserts tables were filled with all kinds of gut busting treats so save some room. The service is good they take plates from your table on a regular bases so you can fill up a new one. 

The price is right as well under 35 bucks for this type of quality is worth it.

BAD:
- Food was good, but was nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion (this is not ""fine dining"")
- Dinner @ $45.95\/ea (""Holiday Pricing"" - for Memorial Day weekend)

GOOD:
- Good overall selection.. was satisfied with Meats selection
- Extensive dessert selection

GOOD & BAD:
- $10\/ea unlimited champagne and mimosas (dinner) - price is good, though refills were slow as molasses so I'm not sure that really constitutes as ""unlimited""

I was a little surprised at the interior d√©cor.. a little underwhelming for the Wynn.

So, this one was on my list. When we signed up for the Red (Players) card, we were told that we only needed 55 points to earn a free buffet! Alright! Sooooo, $100 dollars later (each!) we had earned our ""free"" buffet. 

Since we don't eat until later anyway, and it was a Wednesday, the line wasn't really long. Our server was absolutely incredible. Our drinks were always filled and our used plates were constantly pre-bussed. Yay for good service!

On to the food! 

I thought the salad station was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, I prefer the Cravings Buffet's salad station at the Mirage where they custom mix your salad into this gorgeous chopped salad. 

Anyway, I thought that they had a lot of high-end food. If I eat at a buffet, I stay away from a lot of the filler foods (bread, pasta, pizza) so that I have room for the real food (prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc). Let me tell you, if you only get one thing, the king crab legs are SO worth the buffet price. They are even split for you! I just wish that they were hot. The prime rib was good, not great. My bf said that all of the fish he got was cold. I do wish that I had saved room for some of their chicken panang!

We make the Wynn Buffet one of our highlight evenings every trip and have done so many times a year for last few years.  I have always felt great in recommending Wynn Buffet as the place to go for King Crab, huge fresh shrimp, fresh carved turkey and unique game.  The pasta and wok stations are great and the desserts are top notch.  But....no more.

We were amazed that there was no line at dinner time.  We walked directly to the cashier and wondered if they were closed.  Word must have gotten out.  The crab is snow crab, ok times are tough.  But you can serve cold king crab and dip it in hot butter.  But ice cold snow crab?  Add to this the shrimp is now about 30ct vs. the 22 ct size they had prior (about 1\/3 smaller).  Even if small that would be ok but these were not fresh they were just wet and soft.  

Some of the unique dishes are just MIA such as leek cakes.  There are almost no beef dishes other than prime rib.  They used to have venison or game and that is just gone and the dishes they do have suffer the indignity of poor rotation as I never expected at The Wynn.

On the plus, the desserts are still the best.  The warm brownie is fantastic.  They have a crepe station and do creme breuille.  Also we had excellent service though others have issues in this area we always have had great service.  And, I suppose you could say it is a plus...there is no line...and I suspect it will stay that way.",0,0,0

I can't ever eat enough to make it worth it, I am pretty picky and have a fairly sensitive stomach to food being left out.  That being said I was impressed with this buffet.

You can make any brunch a champagne brunch for $7 more. $7 for all you can drink champagne is a deal!

We arrived around 3 PM. This meant we paid lunch prices but dinner started at 3:30 PM so we could eat dinner food. 

Not wanting to try much of the lunch food being left out I stuck to the carving station. The teriyaki flank steak was probably the best I have EVER eaten. It was so delicious. So after a plate of steak and green beans which where cooked to perfection as well I took a break and digested until fresh food came out.

My fiancee got some of everything. He liked the pasta bar where they made you your own pasta dish. But he just loves food. He ate like 6 plates and was in heaven. 

At 3:30 I went up and got some giant crab legs, roast turkey and prime rib. All where spectacular. 

The fiancee and I sampled a plate full of deserts. The deserts where hit or miss. The mini red velvet cupcake and chocolate covered marshmellows where my favorites. They will make you crepes or an ice cream sundae. I just could not stomach that much food.

Offer a notorious buffet on every person's priority list? Check. My review will just disappear in a sea of the more detailed Yelpers so I will just leave one very, very crucial important tip that I wish I had used when I went: If you're going for lunch, go between the hours of 3-4. Why? Because this is when they start changing from the lunch to dinner menu so you'd be paying the lunch price for dinner quality food. I did not realize this until I was walking out and saw people with heaps of prime ribs, crab legs, and assortments of other meats and delectable crustaceans I did not see during my 5 trips to the food tables. 

The wait is always going to be a MINIMUM of one hour no matter when you go, so I also suggest you pre-game your stomach and snack beforehand. Or while you're waiting, you've got an hour, that's plenty of time. Don't go starving because the appetite will be gone after an hour of waiting in line.

They have the King Crab legs, although my only complaint is that there is a long wait just to get the Crab legs. Wynn has a strange setup whereby you get the food at food carts where you can only access the food from one side, and the other side is pushed against a wall. This creates extremely long queues, whereas the food carts at Bellagio buffet are all open space, where you can easily grab your food from all four corners. 

Another negative thing, is that the sushi range is quite poor for such a reputable Casino. Price wise, I remember it being a couple of dollars more expensive that Bellagio; which in my opinion doesn't make sense. 

However, I am a big fan of their pasta section. You basically tell the chef what type of pasta, sauce and meat and they will cook it up for you on the spot. My favorite is the pesto sauce, delicious!

After scouting out the popular buffets at the Strip, the Wynn seemed to have the best value ($36 weekend brunch). Wicked Spoon ($36) and Bellagio ($33) don't offer the carving station at brunch, while Bacchanal ($54) has extensive variety but to the point that it saturates your stomach space and makes decisions extremely difficult. Oh, first world problems. 

=Brunch Noms=
(++) Orange & white chocolate French toast - The French toast is stuffed! I like the chewy pieces of candied orange, though you need to have a some degree of a sweet tooth to enjoy this. 
(+) Lemon & ricotta beignets - Very ricotta, some lemon, minimally beignet. Essentially, it's a huge chunk of ricotta infused with a hint of lemon, wrapped in a thin crepe-like coating. 
(+++) Maryland crab cake Benedict with Old Bay Hollandaise - One of the highlights of the meal! Despite the recent warnings about toxins found in crabs due to algae blooms, there is no denying crab cake Benedicts from a Vegas brunch buffet. The crab cakes were not diluted by starchy filer, consisting almost entirely of pulled crab meat seasoned with herbs and a thin crispy fried coating.
(+++) Shrimp & Grits - Comfort food at its finest. (and it's not even fried!) Juicy shrimp, nutty grits, a blend of cheese and spice, all around good flavor.

=Carved to order=
(++) Rotisserie roasted prime rib - Quite good, though not the best beef I've ever had. Be warned that the horseradish is the real deal i.e. it's as strong as wasabi
(+) 5 spice and honey glazed ham - I asked for a small piece of the prime rib and a small piece of ham, and I ended up with a small piece of prime rib and a huge slab of ham. Go figure. Portion issues aside, the ham had a bit of a course texture but was otherwise nice and smokey with honey overtones
(+) Rotisserie chicken - Latin style, with decent chicken flavor that paired well with the leek; however it's on the dry side in comparison to your typical Costco rotisserie chicken
(+\/-) Char siu ribs - Creative concept, but unfortunately turned out more like dry ribs in need of BBQ sauce
(+\/-) Asian BBQ bacon - Again, better in concept. There were gigantic strips of fat making only the top half edible, which overwhelmed the pepperiness of the crust

=Healthy=
(++) Red kale salad with sea salt caramel vinaigrette - Hurray for vegetables in Vegas! Avant-garde blend of nutty, almost bitter red kale along with a tangy vinaigrette. The leaves were fresh and crisp
(++) Charred octopus with cucumber miso salad - The big triangular plate can be infuriating if you are trying to cram a lot of fod onto your plate, but the octopus was prepared well. You can really taste the charredness, and it wasn't too chewy
(-) Green tea chia seed parfait - Could definitely use more green tea, and I couldn't find any chia seeds o.O It was also odd that it tasted like panna cotta but the consistency was closer to parfait

=International=
(+) Shrimp panko - Lol it's fried but not panko; nonetheless, good balance of a big juicy shrimp fried golden crispy
(+) Thai sweet chili chicken wings - I would have liked more chili and less sweet, but I like the Thai spin on fried chicken wings

=Dessert=
(+++) Crackerjack cake - A clever interpretation on crackerjack! The cake features a crisp middle layer, flanked by a mild caramel cake and a Graham-cracker-like crust. Brings the nostalgia of crackerjack to a craft dessert 
(++) Tiramisu - sufficiently alcoholic P: Apparently it's sugarless, but I think they use an artificial sugar because it was mildly sweet
(+) Yuzu citrus cake - Very citrusy; I would have liked the more nuanced flavors of yuzu
(-) Mango sorbet - Maybe it's my own fault for having Jean-Philippe mango sorbet the day before, but this was not very mango-y
(+) Thai tea pudding - Yummy rendition of Thai tea into a pudding, with the condensed milk layer replaced by sweet cream

The ambiance is simply beautiful. Unlike much of the decor in Vegas which can easily fall into the tackiness, the Buffet at the Wynn remains elegant. The atrium features a tall glass ceiling with columns of flowers and fruit, and the rest of the dining area has vibrant colors.

Forget Ceasars and the long line. Check out The Buffet! Prime rib is so delicious and their ribs??! I die and gone to heaven!! $16 extra for unlimited champagne, red\/white or beer too??! 

The new ramen bar is awesome too!

I had to wait like 6 years to finally eat at The Buffet at the Wynn!  And, wow, I ended up not being as enamored as I thought I would be.  I think I was spoiled a bit from other buffets.  Although maybe in their defense I didn't see the entire picture because we only went for lunch.  Maybe all the stops are pulled out for dinner?  I dunno.

It was a lovely afternoon with the wifey and after the HELL that is parking on any Strip property, we were on our way to The Buffet.  Line was already sort of long, we waited about 25 minutes before paying to go in.  After being seated, it was off to the races!  I was too excited to wait for a drink order.  

We approached the buffet line with a small crowd.  After the dust settled, what do I see?  A typical looking buffet?  Nah, can't be!  But overall, I was just not impressed!  What happened?  All the glowing reviews?  The heaps of praise?  I think my visit to Wynn's The Buffet came a bit too late, I really should have came when they first opened.  It just seemed so....average.

There were glimpses of good things at The Buffet, but that's all it was.  Many of the items available for lunch would probably be par for the course at other buffets in town.  Cheeseburger sliders?  Check.  But the ones at Golden Corral are just as good, if not actually bigger.  Rotisserie chicken?  Check.  Come on.  Costco's in my opinion is good too.  Pizza?  Check.  Need I go on?

I tried to pick things that I wouldn't be able to enjoy at other eateries, or things not typically available on a buffet line.  But a lot of it seemed BLAH.  I did enjoy the small charcuterie section of The Buffet - a number of cured meats, nice cheeses, crackers and breadsticks for sampling.  The whole ground mustard was delicious.  But really, mustard?  One cannot get full on that alone.  If I was in a tapas place or something with a cold one, charcuterie would be ideal.

Trying to make a plate was a bit of a challenge.  So many of the things were just TOO familiar.  I was expecting more.  The salad section was pretty but nothing stood out for me to try.  The congee section was a nice touch, and actually looked cool.  But the wifey loves congee in almost any form, and she said the one here at The Buffet was bland, not much taste by itself.  The condiments on top didn't really save it.  She said the congee at the Rio Carnival Buffet was better!

I'm a little upset on Wynn's Asian section of the buffet.  So.  Damn.  Disappointing.  Mr. Wynn, you have one of the largest stakes of casino property in Macau...how can you ignore us Asians here in the states?  Your people should know that Asians visit the Wynn constantly!  Your Asian section is not up to standards!  So little choices, and bad ones at that!  Yes, that day at the buffet there were a TON of Asian folks eating, and yes, they all congregated at the Asian section.  The Asian sections of other top buffets in town are much larger, with better quality selections.  The dumplings?  Tasted store bought.  The hand rolls offered?  Soggy and too spicy.  The sushi?  Very, very mediocre.  It's like the person making them didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.  Rice was starting to dry out.  Why try making Hawaiian Poke if it's not made right?  The portion was miniscule in individual dishes, and the flavor profile was way off.  I should know, I'm from Hawaii!

I had to stick with the other sections of the buffet to get something to eat.  There were a few gems, the meatloaf with the pearl onions being one of them.  Can you imagine that, meatloaf the highlight??  It blew my mind too.  But sadly, this is how it was for me.  I was expecting much better, and just didn't get that.

I heard at the buffet at the Wynn they have their own dessert ROOM.  Ooh, an entire room!  But again, we were severely disappointed.  Where are the fancy desserts?  I saw the candy apples but I also saw some kid who looked like he was about to break a tooth on them.  So I skipped that.  The gelato wasn't anything special, we can now find that at the local Station Casino buffet.  A lot of desserts didn't look appetizing or worth the calories.  It really all looked like mini desserts brought in from another local bakery that supplies other restaurants.  Left the dessert ROOM very sad.

The service was downright lackluster.  Our server was only present at the beginning to take our drink order.  The entire meal we didn't get refills until near the end.  Totally irritating, especially since all we ordered was water and iced tea.

For the price of $25.99 for lunch I felt a bit ripped off.  Really, I think it's overpriced for what you are getting.  The lunch at the Bellagio buffet is less and I think offers better choices.  At Wynn you pay for the ambience more than anything because it is a nice space with lots of sunlight.  I'll visit again someday (maybe in another 6 years) but next time will consider dinner instead in hopes of there being a more varied food menu.",5,1,1

I recommend coming early. Dinner starts at around 3:30. My only minor complaint is I wish table service was a little more quick. But that's it.

Just a side rant: I feel that it's easy for scumbags to cut in line when it starts moving. This happened last time I ate there. The line was progressing and they were letting people from the second line go to the main line and this stupid couple wandered right in front of me as I was walking. God, that's annoying.

Peking duck has too much Hoisin so you should probably ask for it on the side if you want it.
Crab legs were good, they're cut in half so it's easier to eat.
Tuna ceviche was good the first time we went, though tasted like it'd been sitting out too long the second.
Fried turkey was GOOOD. Like really. Go get it.
Beef shanks was good according to the bf, I'm not much of a red meat person.
Prime rib was also REALLY good according to the people we went with.
Corn with lime chili was yummy but I really just like corn.

- hargow dumpling - was surprisingly not bad!
- mashed potatoes - so rich, smooth, and creamy
- veal short ribs - tasted like pork belly!

Pass:
- sushi - not good
- salads in the glass cups by the cold seafood section - only ok
- chocolate covered marshmallow - cute, but hard

I'd like to be edgy and end my review there, but then you wouldn't know WHY I believe this buffet is overpriced and has a higher Yelp review than it deserves.  It's good, it's fine, etc.  But it's not great.  It's not worth the $40 (price w\/ tax) for dinner.

A friend swore this place was the best buffet ever, and we'd never been to the Wynn, so it was a good excuse to go.  The atmosphere is really cool.  And the food presentation is nearly immaculate.  But about half the things we tried (there were three of us) looked better than they tasted.  Several dishes were bland, several desserts too dry.  I was super pumped to see red velvet cupcakes -- that crumbled into a mess when you try to eat it.  Not worth $40.

Service was OK.  It started out good, but pretty soon I was walking over to the server table to refill my own water glass because the one employee in our section never even looked our way after 10 minutes of waiting for a damn refill.  Where was our server?!  Turns out, she skipped out to do who knows what, but she totally got in trouble in front of everyone when she returned.  Anyway, maybe service is regularly OK, but it sucked mostly for us.

I know this review is mostly negative, yet I'm still giving three stars.  It's still above average.  But I would highly suggest coming here for a meal other than dinner -- way too costly for what you get.  I'm going back the Bellagio buffet next time.",1,0,1

And you only have to pay lunch price :)

My friends and I were staying at the Wynn, so we decided to eat here. We got a discount because we were staying at the Wynn, but the price also wasn't that bad (mid 20's). They told us our group of 8 would have to be separated, but they were able to seat all of us at the same table!! +1 star for them. lol

There was TONS and TONS of food. And not just FOOD, but delicious looking food. For brunch, this included pancakes, waffles, french toast, eggs, eggs benedict, soups, fruit, salad, cheeses, breads, various meats, shrimp, sushi, yogurt and granola cups, cereal, pastas, i could go on forever. Dinner included more meats, pastas, and the MAIN feature, KING CRAB LEGS. Yes, king crab legs!!!!! who serves that at a buffet?!?!?! ahhhh they were SO SOSOSOSO good. Plus, they served them already cut so those of us who have trouble getting the meat out could avoid getting some wounds during our meal :)

The dessert section was very cute\/delicious-looking as well. Desserts presented in various containers, mousses, cakes, ice cream with toppings, a crepe making station... my only irk was the creme brulee. I love creme brulee and this creme brulee tasted good, but the consistency was all wrong (aka way too liquid-y). But the buffet made up for this with all the other desserts (the oreo mouse cake was delish :D)

I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would definitely come back myself. The king crab legs alone made the buffet worth it, but I loved all the other food i tried as well. Definitely one of the better buffets in Vegas :)",8,6,8

The Buffet at the Wynn is one of favorite buffets next to the Bellagio, Paris, and seafood buffet at the Rio for the money.  Gourmet food, world class selection, and amazing atmosphere!

Atmosphere:
The Wynn itself is beautiful and the theme continues for the buffet.  In the center is an elegant display of flowers and a high ceiling with plenty of light.  The seats are comfortable and the dining areas are just right...not to mention the availability of a RESTROOM versus walking back out into the hotel floor to find one...just in case ;)

Food:
Choices, choices, choices.  From the homemade salad to the world dishes and best dessert buffet in town there is just so much to choose from.

I've been to this buffet on many occasions and each time it is a little different and the selection changes here and there.  I highly recommend the salad bar especially when they have the homemade Chinese Chicken salad.  I also love the various ceviches from rock shrimp to scallop.  The sea bass never fails to disappoint.  Even the gourmet pizza is good.  Of course the standard items such as the prime rib and crab legs are a must!

The sushi isn't spectacular, but it is good for a buffet.  The asian dishes are also pretty good...on my last trip it was Chinese New Year's and they served dim sum, which was yummy!

Dessert is my favorite part of the whole dining experience as there are even more options.  I've had candied apples, gelato, cupcakes, cookies, bread pudding, and more!  

**Tip: Be sure to save room for dessert or at wear loose fitting clothing.

Service:
Terrific.  Once you order your drink  you are good to go.  After each ""round"" of food you will come back to see your old plates and silver gone and replaced with new ones.  Drink refills are fast as well....even for champagne.

I have noticed that in the couple years that I've visited this buffet it has gone down slightly in terms of food appeal...or maybe I've been spoiled now and am slightly jaded.

After hearing this surprising news, seeing as that we did our due diligence in checking prior to going, we showed the cashier what it stated on the website and advised her that we did not deem it fair due to the lack in clarity online and seeing as that we were about to spend $200 on a meal here that the shirt should be comp'd.  You see, it's not the factor about spending the money on the shirt, for goodness sake we were there to spend money.  It's the principle that we checked and the website was very vague.  The cashier did not attempt to speak to us at all.  Instead, she stated that it was above her pay grade and called the manager immediately.  When the manager came to speak with us, we explained what was going on and she very quickly just pointed to the sign that you guys have by the register and stated that, ""that was the policy"".  I requested that they comp the shirt or charge us 1\/2 price for the shirt or do something just for the frustration and the lack of clarity on the website.  She said that we could go back to our hotel and change if we didn't want to buy a shirt.  I then reminded her that we were about to spend over $200 in her restaurant alone and that we felt as though there were something she could do and she proceeded to say, "" that is your decision if you want to spend the money here or not"".

No matter, it's worth the money and I'm usually known to be frugal. This place actually put thought into their interior decor...granted, in ten years it will probably be outdated, but for now the bright pastel green colors make for some nice eye candy, along with the wonderful flower arrangements (yes, girls only notice these things it seems).

The food that was served was top of the line, and the dishes had a wonderful shape that made every plate seem like a masterpiece. Food is clearly labeled, the layout is great for balancing out heavy lines and can I just say again that the food was absolutely impeccable. Everything was done just right.

The dessert: this is a fairly important aspect of the buffet for me. It's the one time you can truly feel spoiled for having so many sweet choices. The creme brule was the best by far from all of the buffets, even the Bellagio and Paris. The others serve it in these mini cups where it's already gone cold, while this place presented it in a special dish and the burnt sugar was extra thick. The dessert was worth the money alone.

One evening I suggested that we visit one of the famous buffets for breakfast. Husband thought that was a good idea, and dad wanted us to have some newlywed time to ourselves. After finding the ""best"" reviewed, we settled on the Wynn. I did my homework, too - we got their early as early could be, so that we wouldn't be waiting an hour and a half in line.

The price for the champagne brunch was $45\/person - not cheap in the *slightest.* So, you'd think for a total of around $100, you'd want to be wowed and impressed so hard your heart stops, right? I'm looking over at the ""Reviews for The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas,"" of all my friends whom I trust wholeheartedly with food recommendations, giving The Buffet a fulfilling 5 stars. Every one of them! Keane L. even said that the 2 hour wait was totally worth it! The reviews are all at least 2 years old, but they range from '06 to '09 - surely if there is consistency between those years, then from '09 to '11 there would be as well?

Nope.

To be honest, I can't even remember anything standing out. I had amazing prime rib at Jerry's Nugget out in crack-ville for $10 - the cut on my plate at the Wynn was blegh. The desserts were just okay, and they didn't have ANY crab - highly disappointing. The selections were - for some odd reason, because it was 8am and we were the first ones in the door - old, as if they were just sitting under the hot plate the entire time. I tried to sample as much as I could, but this all looked like regular buffet food at some regular-ass buffet. I felt like I was paying for the brand more than the food itself.

Sorry, Wynn. No crab, no stars. Presentation is top, but I'd rather have it look like a pile of dung and taste like a dream than the other way around. How utterly disappointing! Next time, I'm heading to crack-ville for breakfast.",0,5,0

The food was awesome, their sliders, quesadillas, different kinds of pastas and various meat cut makes it the buffet with the most food options available. Their desert section is also enormous, with panna cotta, ice cream\/sorbet, Madeline's, key lime pie, candy apples, all of which were top quality.

Pros:
Large selection, esp. for carbs; breads, pastas, pizzas galore
Other stations include Mediterranean (with hummus, baba ghanoush); Italian (pizzas, veggie calzones, pastas\/ pasta station); American (prime rib, corn on the cob, cauliflower, candied butternut squash, mashed potatoes); Seafood (king crab legs galore); charcuterie with dried figs and tampenades; Asian (dim sum, noodles, sushi, Japanese salads)
Huge dessert section, including cheesecakes, gelato, mousses,  
Friendly service

Highlights: 
Profiteroles, yum!
Clearly marked vegetarian and vegan offerings; larger selection of meat-free food than other buffets
Delectable salads, esp the heirloom tomato and fresh mozz
Most fresh buffet food so far
Prime rib

Cons:
Mediocre Asian food section: dim sum = steamed cha shiu bao, vegetarian egg rolls, a bit too much like Chinese take-out
Crepes: very soggy and weird chocolate flavor. Ew.
No sugar added desserts- good to offer, but very poor on taste

 The food was pretty uninspiring on our visit today. There seemed to be a disproportionate offering of starches meant to fill you up (lots of pastas, etc) and pretty bland seafood. The presentation was decent, but nearly everything looked better than it tasted. The crab legs were decent, the beef undercooked, the pork overcooked. The deserts were the prime example of presentation but no substance.

 The service was terrible. We had to ask three times for water and had to give our drink order twice. When we ordered their sangria, the waiter said to us ""you know that costs extra, right?"", which I found sort of insulting, particularly since we'd order it from their drink menu with clearly stated prices next to it. We didn't see any of the wait staff again until they dropped the bill for the drinks (though they did keep the table cleared).  The awkward waiter commented to my girlfriend ""on to desert already"" and we spent the rest of the meal trying to understand what that meant.

 Perhaps it was an off day, or due to the fact that we came very early (late lunch\/early dinner) but I expected more of the Wynn. We'd skipped it the last time we tried to eat here because of the line and I'm glad we did, because it wouldn't have been worth the wait. In the end, we decided that there are too many other buffets to try and we've already visited far better, so we won't be back.",1,0,0

I think it's because of the variety of items that they have to offer, plus the match between that variety to what I enjoy eating. So in this review I'm going to talk about the items that I love best:

Prime Rib - At least 2 helpings of this bad boy. Most of the time they get it perfectly done.....medium rare with horseradish and au jus on top. Sometimes it's a tad too done because the chef is cutting you a piece from the side, which is ok because you can always go back and get another! 

Crab legs - Super fresh. A palate cleanser and so much more. I can never get full off of these light juicy briny crab legs. 

Jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce - Again very fresh and jumbo. The spicy\/cool combo is fantastic.

Black mussels with garlic bread - I love the clams and mussels at this buffet. Both got a slight spicy kick to them.  For the black mussels you can eat with the garlic bread and slather up the juices from the mussels...excellent.

Clams Asian-style - Same as above....I can eat a few dozen of these. It's pretty popular so sometimes I had to wait until they come out with a new batch. Worth the wait.

Shrimp tempura roll - a very simple dish, but I like the crunch. 

Flan\/Creme Brulee - It's a treat to get them here because I don't have the opportunity to eat them much.  I like the serving of the creme brulee. They don't give you a ton of the cream and then a lil bit of the crunchy burnt sugar. It's proportional so I don't feel bad having to leave all the cream and just eat the crunchy top.

So after you eat all this.....you are definitely prepared for a night of clubbing\/gambling!",0,1,0

Dessert was mediocre though.  Service was terrible at the dessert station.  The lady who served me ice cream would take her time to walk up to me and when she asked what I wanted, she didn't even make eye contact or smile.

My husband and I spent 4th of July weekend in Vegas and ate at the The Buffet 4th of July evening.  Huge mistake.  Less than one hour after we got back to our room, my husband started to feel a little queasy.  Thinking it was due to a little overeating, we assumed with a little Pepto and water he would be fine.  Fast-forward 10 hours, it is 5:30 in the morning and I am racing my husband to an urgent care facility in Vegas because he has been puking his guts out and having diarrhea ALL NIGHT LONG.  

After getting back from urgent care, where he had to be put on an IV drip due to massive dehydration, we made a point to stick around to submit a statement with Security because we believed it to be food poisoning from the hotel's buffet.  We requested only his half of our money back because I didn't get sick.

About 24-36 hours later, the hotel claims department called us at home to follow up.  The nice lady over the phone told us that because they could not definitively determine the cause of my husband's sudden and violent illness, they would not be refunding our money.  As my husband later put it, this lady was clearly hired to act sympathetic to our plight and then at the end ever so politely tell us to go to hell.

Food for thought:
1. My husband and I had nothing else to eat that day because we were saving our stomachs for the buffet.
2. We are not big on alcohol and we did not have a drop of it to drink that night.
3. I am much pickier than my husband and did not eat many of the foods he ate.  By itself, my not getting sick proves nothing.
4. It is entirely possible that my husband picked the one piece of meat that was not under the heat lamp and was therefore at an unsafe temp, thus resulting in hordes of ecoli, salmonella, etc. populating it, later making him sick.

If you assholes working for this establishment are reading this, yes I am PISSED that my husband and I spent about $110 total to eat at your shitty buffet and you didn't have the grace and decency to refund us the half we requested, but we filed that claim not for compensation necessarily but because we wanted you to know your standards are slipping.  

Many thanks for treating us like garbage and most likely turning a blind eye to dangerous SOP that could get others horribly ill.

Appetizers:
A decent selection, but what Wynn focused on is quality.  Exceptionally well laid out Shrimp and especially the crab legs.  I was surprised by the level of quality of the available seafood.  They may not focus on a large variety but appears to have the best quality. 

Salads:
Very good selection of veggies and really tasty dressing here as well.

Main Entree:
Not much variety but they definitely focused on quality.  They attempt to provide the best quality dishes in a buffet setting. 

Desserts:

The crab legs are split down the middle so you don't have to crack anything. Shrimp are large and plentiful. Some Chinese tourists were amazed at how much shrimp I was piling on my plate. This is America, man! They had banana fosters on order, but I heard it's not there anymore.

I last ate here near the beginning of the year for my birthday. A few things have changed with the buffet's menu. However, the line was still like waiting around for a ride in a theme park. No problem. I skipped out on the champagne because I was determined to go through at least 3 plates of food. The following are the items I enjoyed the most out of what I tried:
- The salmon (Very moist. It's absolutely gross when it's dry and flaky.)
- Spicy tuna hand rolls. (So good! I could barely get through two of them because my mouth was on fire.)
- Seafood tart (Basically a mini crab omelet, yet it was a tasty little sucker.)
- Shrimp cocktail (My main buffet staple. A trip to Vegas is not complete unless I have this.)
- Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (I hear this mentioned a lot on Food Network. Now I know why. This can kick my container of Kraft parmesan cheese's butt any day.)
- Kobe beef slider (As one of the girls in my party said, ""It was orgasmic!"" Yes, yes it was. Kobe burgers are just as good as their steak. But I'm more of a burger person, so this was right up my alley.)
- And the last but definitely not the least *drumroll* dessert.
The latter consisted of plastic shot glasses containing lime and raspberry mousse, tapioca pudding with mango and lychee, pear mousse, and cute little tea cups filled with panna cotta laced with Bailey's. I don't care how full I get at buffets, I will always ALWAYS  make room for dessert. Especially at The Buffet. I also put aside a snickerdoodle and a triple chocolate chip cookie for later.

Just came back from eating here tonight.
Every dining occasion I have a wonderful time! The food is a great top notch experience :)
My only peeve is the line you have to wait in to be seated. I've stood in line for an hour before, and their receipt\/table seating is never organized... (it's decorated so amazing that you have something to zone out)
but as soon as you get to the actual buffet, everything is forgiven!
I always make sure to sample a little bit of everything (about 4-5 plates - sushi, crab, octopus, sea bass), but always leave room to sample one or two desserts! (crepes, ice cream, candy apples, etc)

Its a notch above the Los Angeles buffets such as Universal Hilton as well as the ones in Vegas.  The second closest to the Wynn is the Bellagio IMO.

The king crab legs are a good indication of how good a place will be.  The legs here are long and plump.  The way they pop out of the shell and plump up tells me they are quite fresh.  What stands out to me in the Wynn buffet is there attention to detail.  Each dish they prepare has a little something more that makes it stand out from the rest.  Its not just a meat dish, its a type of meat with a certain sauce.  The carving table options are better than most. I also liked their pasta bar which is operated by someone who is actually Italian lol. Dessert bar could be bigger in terms of selection but I felt it was sufficient.

I have gone on both a weekend and a weekday.  The weekend lines are quite long (2 hrs) and the weekday lines are like 30min.  I believe the weekend price is a bit higher...as well as when holidays come around.  The weekday dinner price was like $33.  I think the price is fair and would not mind throwing that money out for such a good meal.

One thing I did not like was our waiter who gave us our drinks.  He took a while and did not seem on point. 

My advice...go to vegas and indulge yourself in gluttony at the Wynn Buffet.  Don't leave until you've downed at least 3000 Calories and walk it off on the Strip. =D",1,0,0

They have an array of different foods there from seafood to Asian to traditional American. They have a lot of great things! In the seafood section (as many others have remarked), they have king crab legs for dinner. They are fresh and extremely sweet so if that is all you're going for, this is a great deal for your money IMHO. 

They also have several types of Dim Sum which was great for me as I haven't had good Dim Sum for a almost a year now. They had prime rib the night I was there and a fantastic collection of cheese!

Now, don't miss the desserts. They are located in a completely different section. They have an array of different sweets including ice cream, make your own crepes, bread pudding and fresh cookies.

The line was about an hour and a half, that was expected so we considered it part of the price for this amazing meal we would be enjoying.

As a vegan, I really wanted to try the Wynn Buffet because I obviously know that Steve Wynn is a vegan and I'd heard that the buffet had several clearly labeled vegan options. I was the only vegan in a group of 7 and I figured this was a great option since we could have a (albeit pricey) meal we could all enjoy.
Upon arriving, we all paid separately and when we went to be seated we were told that to be seated together we'd have to paid extra. Honestly, the horrible customer service alone was enough to ruin the experience. We were also told we'd have the gratuity added, but that didn't bother me as much because I know that's pretty standard with large parties- but to have to pay to sit together was beyond ridiculous. When the server took our drink orders, she only took them for half the table. Once I went up to the buffet, I found exactly 3 options labeled vegan (that wasn't a plain salad, because who goes to Vegas to eat salad?!?): a tofu lo mein stir fry, tomato soup, and a mango puree dessert.

I ended up making the most of the situation and eating vegetables that, although well-prepared and quite tasty, were obviously laden with butter.

The food: 4\/5. The crab legs are as good as they say; very hearty portions per leg, and a plethora of condiments to go along with it. I preferred the drawn butter with the crab legs. The shrimp and cocktail sauce was simply divine as well; the seafood was my first helping, and i could not get enough of it. In round two i went for everything else; a slice of pizza, the prime rib, lamb, dumplings, egg rolls, and a little more here and there. The pizza wasn't really my favorite simply because everything else was of superior quality. The prime rib was excellent; melted in your mouth, was perfectly pink in the middle. The lamb was varied; the first slice was succulent and was bursting with flavor; the second slice was a little bit dry. The dumplings and egg rolls exceeded my expectations; the egg roll was vegetable, but despite that it was still excellent. Dessert: the creme brulee was tasty. Hard caramelized shell on top, cool and creamy filling on the bottom. The gelato was good, but served in small scoops. The crepes were of exceptional quality as well; but somehow the cook refused to put more than one fruit at a time on each crepe. I was hoping for a small combination of the strawberries, blueberries and apricots. Oh well.

The environment: 4\/5. Clean, spacious and respectable. The waiters were all kind, albeit every now and then we had to flag them down for refills on drinks. 

Price: 3\/5. I'll be honest here, the food was great, but selection was slightly narrow and the quality (great as well, don't think i'm knocking on Wynn here) did not seem it was worth the $45 (otd) price. But then again, it's vegas, you can't waltz in and expect bargains.

We also had lunch on one day and the experience was even worse. More than half the restaurant was empty and still there was a waiting for about 15 minutes. The attendant (Fernando) was rather unprofessional with him throwing his arms in all direction and serving very unpleasantly. 

Though the food and spread is good, the menu does not change everyday. It gets rather monotonous for a person staying for 4 days. There are some asian dishes which are same for breakfast and lunch which is not expected out of a 5 star property.",0,0,0

I was fortunate enough to try this buffet 4 times as per complimentary from the encore hotel. Yes they treat their guests that good!

Anyways i tried their lunch, weekend supper and weekday supper. And out of them all the quality surpassed quantity here. But the weekend supper is completly the best by far. 

The standard options are unlimitwd ayce king crab legs, cocktail shrimps, scallop ceviches, california rolls, chinese dumplings, fried rice and noodles, a guacamole dipping sauce area,  a taco station, a ramen station,  prime rib, roasted turkey, roasted pork, mac and cheese, truffled mash potatoes, fried chicken, roasted corn, clam pasta, ravioli, assorted pizzas, 3 types of fish seasoned differently. A sliced meat, fresh cheese, baked buns, with 3 types of sausages, a salad station and then after all that desserts... cheesecake, carrot cake, passion fruit tapioca, mini cupcakes, assorted gelato, a cree statiom and so on. Wow thats a mouthful and i didnt get it all yet!!!

The difference is that is what offered at lunch. On a weekday supper expect the following additions: roasted lamb chops, a peking duck bun station, creme brulee and japanese sushi cones, and mussels.

On weekend suppers is where its at though. For only $3 extra bucks. You get everything above with more additions: like freshly shucked oysters, smoked salmon, japanese sushi cones, pork and shrimp dumplings (shu mai) steamed fresh pork buns, and  fresh clams. Thats well worth the extra price. 

I found the quality superb. Everything was fresh and of high quality. No poor cuts of meat or fishy fish. Everything is just as good as any restaurant! 

Service wise. Its hit or miss. On 3 of my visits i had superb service. Drinks refilled quickly. Plates cleared fast. And speedy assistance if needed. On one of my visits the waiter just didnt clear the dishes and i just put them on an another table. They were cleared quicker this way! But she was moody slow and moved at a snails pace. She didnt refill my drinks unless i prompted her twice and was attentive only to select tables. I cant believe she still has a job. 

The wynn resorts have always had impeccable service and this was the one exception. Its not worth minusing a star but worth mentioning. I saw her on two other visits and i felt awful for her tables bc they were all full and dirty. Nobody wants to eat on a full table! Maybe it was her way of saying ok you had more than two plates. Get the hell out. Bc thats how she made you feel. 

But overall. This is the best buffet ive been to in vegas..and i dont like buffets bc the quality is poor and not up to par for what i like. But i made no exceptions here.

What a disappointment!  Way overpriced, way overrated.  It's $40 and worth less than half that.

The seafood station is a joke... overcooked salmon and some sort of seafood pot pie that was disgusting.  The cold seafood was ok, but not high enough quality for the price.  The fried chicken was raw in the middle.  The lamb was chewy and tasteless.  The sushi was another joke... 2 or 3 rolls, no flavor, not very fresh.  Probably the best station was the Italian, tasty meatballs.  And the salad and antipasto stations were nice.  The best part of the buffet was the fact that there was no line...

I used to tell people it was the best buffet on the Vegas Strip, but I am no longer a fan.  

My last visit there was just before Labor Day weekend, and was very disappointing.  

The veal short rib was the only dish that was truly exceptional, while everything else I sampled was just so lackluster: the fried chicken was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful, the Cajun pork loin was flavorless and didn't inspire me to Zydeco, and the sweet pea risotto was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.

Even my favorite go-to desserts seemed to have been replaced with piteous knock-offs that left a chilling ""Invasion of the Dessert Snatchers"" vibe in the air. The cheesecake pops and cake pops I once loved there were now store-bought marshmallows that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick. The gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now deferential and hesitant.         

The service, too, was seriously lacking. While water and drink orders are often frequently refilled at most buffets (and restaurants), our waiter's appearances could be best described as spectral: he showed up at the start of the meal and was never seen or heard from again. If he has 40 years younger, I would have initiated an Amber Alert.  

Sadly, no one came by at any time to pick up the pile of used dishes that were quickly accumulating on our table either. It got so ridiculous that we decided to clear the table ourselves and place our many dishes on the empty, four-seater across from us. Even sadder, a lone diner was seated at that very table shortly thereafter, with everyone oblivious to the Jenga tower of plates and unappetizing leftovers erected diagonally across from her.           

On the up side, many of the diners seemed to be enamored with the giant crab legs that were pouring endlessly out of the kitchen. Plates were filled two and three feet high with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of this buffet. These crab-loving guests tended to ignore the other offerings available to them. Were they in the know? Or were they there just for the crab?

The immense popularity of the crab leg station and the sheer volume being consumed by some diners who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of Omega-3s in their systems seemed to be the ""raison d'√™tre"" for this buffet.

Maybe this is the reason that the Wynn has just given up? Sure, the presentation and vibrant colors of the many meals at each station really stood out, appealed to the eye, and made me want to try everything. But it almost felt like the offerings outside of the crab legs were just there for show, along with the inedible flower arrangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn this dining hall and provide it with its atmosphere.",6,4,1

With seven years passing comes new buffets, more competition, and some shortcomings from my recent experience at The Wynn. Thus, I need to bring my review back down to the ""A-OK"" range on Yelp because that's absolutely how I felt- A-OK.

We waited in line for about an hour before being seated towards the front of the restaurant. On the Sunday we went, we paid for Brunch ($37) but stayed for the dinner options since our flight out of LAS wasn't until much later.

The food  quality and selection here seems to have down as I was reading my previous review. The crab legs no longer were gigantic, there was no sashimi option at all during the evening, and I felt unsatisfied by the desserts. However, the prime rib was still very much a go-to and I loved every bite of my meat.

What really brought down the experience this time around was the service, or lack thereof. Literally, our server left and didn't think to alert anybody else to come check on us. We had to literally get up and flag down people, only for them to find out NOBODY was assigned to our table after our earlier server left. You could imagine our frustration when we couldn't order any more beverages because of this issue.

At the end, we still had a good meal, but the service and general food selection did little to really affirm my golden 5-star review from so long ago. The Buffet is still a great option on the Strip, but I would stick with the competition if you're choosing just one buffet to visit during your trip.",2,2,2

We stupidly missed the lunch by about 5 minutes and payed the more expensive dinner. Nevertheless, the table next to us changed occupants 3 times and we were still there, still going strong. 
Everything was delicious- some more than others of course, and I urge you if you can spare some room for the huge selection of desserts that are available. Oh and for Kit's sake don't fill up precious space on bread (or rice). Be a pro and go for stuff to make your money's worth.

There was a great selection of everything, from meat to seafood to veggie options. Although everyone around me seemed to be going gaga for the crab legs I have to admit they were probably in the bottom 5 of most tasteless ones I have ever had. 

In addition I was impressed with the ladies who were seating people- perhaps they are under payed or have to deal with snobby or tricky clientele but they were certainly unfriendly and rude. Our waiter on the other hand was fantastic and super friendly.

-It will cost you upwards of $40 bucks for dinner.
-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies! 
-After partaking of the lunch buffet at Paris, I felt the selections here weren't that different. 
-Only power outlet that I could find was in the bathroom. (You don't want to know. Or do you?)
-King crab legs were still frozen :(
-Sushi sucks, no sashimi at all unless you count the smoked salmon sitting on a tray in a different section.
-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor. Maybe I'm meat spoiled. 

Upsides:
-Beautiful beautiful decor!
-I got to try rabbit, which I can't remember if I've had before but I would like to say that I have. So let's say I got to resample rabbit. 
-Lots of choices.
-Beautiful dessert selection.
-We got to traumatize an older couple sitting next to us. Muhahaha.

I tried basically a bit of everything and everything was really good. I really loved their thin crust Caprese pizza, it was really good and the cheese they use is absolutely orgasmically good!! I also got some artisanal cheese along with dried figs, grapes, and walnuts they had in their cheese station and they were really good too. 

They have many creative dishes here as well. Lines tend to move quickly to enter the restaurant as well as on the buffet line. For some unknown reason, there was a line for Sushi and Crab leg stations. I'm not too big on buffet style Sushi so I skipped it and got in line for crab legs. 

The atmosphere is very casual and fit for families with kids, although no kids are running around acting all boisterous here, so PLEASE bring your manners and classiness here.

**EAT IT!!**

ONE WORD: Quality. 

Wynn Buffet supersedes all other buffets in Vegas... the only competition: Bellagio. From your usual crab legs all the way to your carppaccio's, Wynn buffet is all about the best quality. You can see it, smell it, and definitely taste it. It's no wonder they were voted #1 Buffet in Vegas! Crab legs... no need for butter, the crab meat is naturally sweet! But my favorite dish of all... the lamb chops... oh god... last time I went, I had 4-5 servings of it... (drools). 

Word to all: Don't pay for the weekday dinners or lunches or brunches... add the extra $10-$15 and go for the weekend menu. There are more choices to choose from and the more expensive food items are available, like the different cuts of meat and various seafood items... unless of course you don't eat either, then the other dishes are much more yummier and different, to say the least. 

You get what you pay for right? Oh, and if there's a long wait... add the extra $10 or so to cut the line.. it's seriously worth cutting the line! Seriously, if you're in Vegas... don't be cheap... the same rules apply for the clubs... you want to get in and not have to wait? 
A. Get there early.
B. Pay the extra dollaz to cut the line (or bouncer) tee-hee. 

CONCLUSION:
If you ain't doin' it big in Vegas, you ain't doin nothin! Go for the best and pay for the best. Weekend dinner only! You won't be disappointed! EAT IT!!!!!!",11,7,11

Brunch is kind of a weird time to gauge the overall quality of a buffet. I can say that I was a little disappointed in their salad section - but that could be different at lunch time?

It was a relatively long wait (we got there at 4:20 PM) and got seated at 5:50 PM.  It was worth the wait.  The king crab legs were actually flavorful and fresh - other buffets also had crab legs but were very bland.  The prime rib rivals that of Lawry's and House of Prime Ribs (in SF).  Chinese roast duck was juicy and the skins are crispy - better than ones I get in Chinatown.  There were also scallop, other seafood, lamb, and other dishes.  All were well made and offers great variety of tastes.  The desserts were also very well made and delicate - for example the Strawberry Mouse Cup had a layer of Champagne jello on top.  Gelato was good and refreshing after a big meal.  
Service was OK - we got our drinks although sometimes staff was hard to find.  Compare to service at Bellagio, though, Wynn still wins hands down.  Bellagio food and service really went downhill.

Their juice bar includes fresh mixed juice drinks (I even overheard a gentleman asking for a pitcher of it!). The meats station offers many hot cuts of meat, sliced to order.

Was lucky to try both during my trip - reading previous reviews, looks like food selection varies slightly daily. My review is based on what I ate - there was alot that I did not try.

Price
- Bellagio is cheaper ($30) vs Wynn ($35)

Interior\/Atmosphere
- Liked Wynn better - garden decorations, more airy brighter & comfortable, less noisy. Bellagio layout seemed more packed & noisy.

Service
- Wynn servers were faster & more attentive and efficient (refills, plate  removal, coffee). 

Food
- Crab goes to Bellagio. Wynn only had split King Crab. Bellagio had King Crab & Snow crab. Both served the crab split & cold - straight from the box (Wynn server kept refilling the buffet straight from the box, they could have done this better). Flavor of both about the same, both very fresh tasting. Wynn provided drawn butter - Bellagio did not.

Shrimp was tie - great at both places.

- Red Meat goes to Wynn. Wynn prime rib was seasoned better - Bellagio tasted like any other buffet. Both offered leg of lamb but was dry. Bellagio offered Kobe sirloin - not memorable. Wynn offered lamb t-bone & osso bucco, both dry.

- Sushi goes to Bellagio. Wynn did not offer. Bellagio also offered Steak tartar - was not appealing or tasty.

- Salad\/Fruit\/Cheese\/Cold meats - tie. I did not eat any green salads or fruit. Salad layouts looked great - I'd rate them a tie. Wynn had cold meats - very nice. Cheese at Bellagio was very nice (esp for dessert).

Desserts goes to Wynn. Preparation of the deserts was better & more variety - loved the mango lychee tapioca. Wynn had more variety & was nicely presented in individual plastic flutes. Coffee was hot at Bellagio, Wynn was warm.

In summary
- Close Tie based on food alone. After trying both, I'm happy to report that both had very nice buffets & can highly recommend them both. If you are crunched for time & need to pick one, go for Wynn - based on atmosphere & service.",9,0,0

What I love about this place:
The dessert section has good selections of gelato (not as good as the ones I had in Italy, but it is still good).  The dessert selections are diverse (cookies, cakes, pies, mousses, decadent chocolates, etc).
King crab legs - ask the cook\/chef manning the grill to grill them off for you, it tastes way better that way. In fact that should be the proper way to serve previously cooked and chilled crustaceans.
Selection and quality of items is good, and items are made in small batches, so you don't have unpopular items on the steam table too long, and getting that tired dried out and unappetizing look that you may find in some of the other casino buffet (like the ones in some Stations Casino operations).
Service is usually good to excellent.  The wait was really long before, but the last two times I went, there was practically no line to get to the cashiers.

Cons: 
it is pricey, but not the most expensive buffet in town.

Give me my appetizer & course and I'm happy. However, when it comes to buffets, I leave full but not completely satisfied.

So we wait in line its about 80 per couple. I was talked into this place since there WAS SUPPOSE to be a cheese selection (not just 2 different types of cheese's cut into cubes) I was expecting a massive cheese collection. (I LOVE CHEESE!!)

Not much of a selection just a little variety in each category.

Their dessert section was good... but most the stuff there weren't the type I would like.. However, their creme burlee was awesome!!

Our plates were mainly the meat and king crab legs... can't really say it was worth it.........",1,3,1

This time the chef didn't seem to know exactly what was in each item.  Made it a little scary to eat things when you aren't sure.  The food we did eat seemed ok.  Nothing special.

We were going back and forth about where to go for brunch that morning and I jumped on the web and came up with this place, every body agreed, some more reluctantly than other.

Once there we waiter for a few mins. nothing crazy though. So we were there on memorial day and the prices were almost double. Once inside, the place is really nice with flowers everywhere and sunny and bright. Waiter comes and takes our drinks order and we proceed to get the food.

Oh the food. Everything was really good and flavorful. Lets see it is me in a buffet so you put 2 and 2 together. I tried salmon pizza, cucumber gazpacho, squid ceviche, stuffed pork, cheese and figs, chicken soup among others and every thing was great. 
There is so much good food that it would be hard to remember everything. Desserts are great as well. I had pecan pie, pina colada cake, chocolate cake and about 6 different flavor icecream that I shared with the group. 

The service was nice and professional. The place is bright and clean and the food is great.

They also have a beautiful selection of dessert, which I always wish I had more room for...

I wish they would improve on some of their food such as their southern station and chinese station - can be off most of the time.

I also think its great because I usually eat 5-10 things that I would order at a normal restaurant and pay a hefty price for.  

My fave is ALWAYS the crab legs.  I beeline for these things and eat a BUNCH of these before I even hit anything else.  This time we had some veal shortribs.  OMG TO DIE FOR.

PROS:
The prime rib was delicious.  They had different types of homestyle and fancy cooked vegetables.  Their thin pizzas were excellent, they had special toppings on a few.  Scrambled eggs were good, not runny. Bacon was thin and crispy.  Omelets were a perfect 1 person size.  They had a red velvet pancake station made to order!  Best highlight was that they had Mabo tofu and XO greenbeans w\/ fried tofu in their chinese section!  AND it tasted Wonderful!  Their Caesar salad was one of the best I've tasted anywhere, the dressing was very anchovy flavored.  Dips and spreads for your breads, crostinis and crackers, cheeses and meats.  There's much more.

The desserts were VERY good.  And the presentation was perfect.  Waiters were all very pleasant and went the extra mile.

CONS:
Their sushi section and Italian section needs ALOT of work.  Sushi selection was very limited and whatever was out was old and crummy looking.  There were only 3 Italian dishes, all three were boring.  They also only had crab legs and cooked cold shrimp.  I expected a little more variety for the big price that was paid before entering, but maybe that's what they normally serve for brunch?

My family and I are big fans of the buffet at the Bellagio, and this one is just as good if not better than the Bellagio's buffet. I love the layout of the buffet, the scenery is gorgeous! The food was all tasty, and called for multiple trips. I loved the fact that they had diabetic friendly desserts, as my Dad is a type two diabetic. The buffet is pretty diverse, ranging from pizza to sushi. My favorite was probably the Chinese section, the potstickers were delicious. The food was great, however the service\/people at the buffet were not so great.

We arrived at the Wynn at about 6:50. We weren't seated until about 7:30. So be prepared to wait, let me just say that the Bellagio's line may be long but it moves fast. The Wynn's line goes by slowly. VERY slowly.

The service is dull. I think we got a refill once. (We all ordered Diet Pepsi's). Our server claimed to ""go on a break"". 

Overall, I think I'd reccomend the Wynn over the Bellagio for one simple reason: the variety is much better. That's the only reason though. If you want a shorter wait and better service, then the Bellagio is your best bet.",1,1,1

The snow crab is delicious and they will even heat it for you if you ask. They put the crab legs in boiling water to warm it. The dessert section is huge! There is a pretty chocolate fountain.

Wynn has a slightly larger selection of food than Bellagio (and a slightly higher dinner price that comes with it -- $170ish for 4 adults on a Thursday night, yuck), but MOST types of foods are covered. Soups and salads? Check. Pizza? Check, and the best pizza in a buffet by far! (I thought Bellagio took top honors in that category, but having eaten their the night before -- they don't). Alongside the pizza was also an assortment of different pasta dishes -- ravioli, tortellini, rigatoni, a build your own pasta station (the Asian chef behind the counter wasn't so friendly though, regardless of how much I smiled and threw in a 'Thank You!', as well as garlic knots!) Other food items include barbecue chicken and ribs, garlic pesto mashed potatoes, TENDER pork loin, 'Indian' rice, 'Chinese' fried rice, chow mein, lamb, duck, turkey, sushi, a seafood station with shrimp and crab ... yeah, and a whole lot more on top of that.

They also have a killer dessert section (better than Bellagio, also). Aside from all the individual dessert platters, they also have someone making crepes (and though they didn't have it the last time I was there, my last trip to Vegas I ate at the Wynn twice XD, and alongside the Crepe-guy they had someone making Belgian Waffles as well! Nom nom).

My only grunt about this place (aside from the pricing and potential long wait if you come at the wrong time) is their lack of Mexican and Chinese food. I have yet to come to a buffet (then again, I've only been to 3 in Vegas) that had a taco or burrito station station, and ... while I love the fact that they have 'Chinese' fried rice and chow mein, what  good are those dishes if I don't have any orange chicken or honey walnut shrimp to eat it with? Also, not a fan of their sushi. Simply just not as fresh as authentic sushi places.

Other than that, this buffet totally rocks my socks off and I'm perfectly content with the amount of weight I gain from eating here.

Most impressed with the seafood: smoked salmon melted in your mouth, plentiful fresh shrimp with cocktail sauce are my go-to, variety of mini sushi rolls to pick from, baked red snapper dish was divine.

I loved that they had a dim sum section, but everything was overcooked: paper wouldn't peel off bottom of barbecue buns, gyoza were falling apart, fried shrimp rolls were stuffed with shrimp but flavorless.
Many options for dessert, but I'm not a sweet tooth so it didn't sway my initial ratings. Best items were the PB-chocolate-pretzel ice cream and profitroles.

Prime rib was tasty (as it is almost everywhere on the Strip) , lots of brunch options I had no interest in taking advantage of (pancakes and omelets made to order), but many things clearly sitting out or not cooked properly: eggs benedict with watery eggs, several condiments that didn't get refilled, etc. It wasn't til we were about to leave that they even refilled the empty lox trays, which is ridiculous for a brunch buffet.

Speaking of refills, drinks at our table were only refilled when we asked. Empty plates were cleared, but waitress acted as if drink refills were simply not her job. Very bizarre.

We figured we would try The Buffet, and from the reviews, seemed like a pretty good place to eat. It was a fairly long walk through the casino and then what seemed like a really long lonely hallway to the restaurant. 

First tip, do not dress up to eat here...I was so overdressed, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.  The quality of food (which is excellent) does not match the atmosphere of this very casual buffet.

When you arrive, you're going to get a sense of tackiness...almost like you are eating in Cinderella's castle at Disney....But with all that being said, we had an excellent dining experience.  The food really is great here.  They had a very large selection, from fresh fish, steaks, salads, desserts, you name it, it was on the buffet.

The buffet area is very big and spread out, so there were no lines to wait for food, or people shoving themselves into your plates to reach for something.  Excellent lay out.

The night we were there, they were serving steamed Char Siu Bao in the Asian section, which is a steamed BBQ pork bun. I have eaten these in China towns across the country (NY and SF) included, and these were the best.  They also had a carving station  with massive bone in steaks and  prime rib.  They had amazing breads, vegetables, lasagna, pizzas, pastas, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, fruits, cheeses, caprese salads, ravioli's....the list goes on and on.  

There wasn't one thing I tasted that I didn't like, and would have gone back for more, had I not been so full.  The dessert section is not huge, but then, who has room for dessert.  All the desserts such as the cakes and mousses were mini's.  They also served gelatto in a few flavors, which looked great, but I didn't have any that night.

Food: they have just about EVERYTHING you could think of.  Full salad bar (even with multiple types of lettuce).  Soups, breads, all different kinds of meats, seafood (crab, shrimp, sushi, sashimi), pastas, omelets, and much much more.  there is a huge selection of desserts, and they even have ice cream\/gelato that they scoop for you on the spot, and put on toppings. yum!  Ive been here a couple times, and the food is always fresh. 

Service: even though the line is rather long, the wait time isnt actually that bad. The wait is well worth it though.  The staff is nice, the cooks\/chefs behind the counters are friendly, and the waiters that occasionally come around are efficient. 

Ambiance: the decorations are so extravagant and pretty! they always have fresh flowers.  there is a TON of natural daylight, so the space always feels fresh.  it almost feels like you are outdoors.  very pleasant place to have lunch\/dinner. 

Price: rather expensive, but for what you get.. well worth it! 

If you go here, be sure not to fill up on bread and pasta.  go for the seafood! yum! 

I would definitely eat here again when i'm in vegas!",0,0,0

No bragging involved but this none Vegas buffet goer did some extensive research. I checked Yelp reviews, browsed the web, and called around to ask for prices. In the end I decided on The Buffet. The prices were most reasonable ($95 for brunch for 4, none holiday weekday pricing) and I think the food was pretty good, not 5 start restaurant good. 

My favorite part was the dessert bar... When you go to buffets you gotta come with a strategy. My strategy is always to bring accomplices. If everyone takes one bite then you can try many more desserts. This was the only time my plan failed. There were waaaaaaay to many to try! Even though I knew I would fail I knew I had to try because I, Chang L. am not a loser. I came, I plated and I chowed down.

For one, it's the Wynn so expectations are higher than any normal spot however it is a buffet so the quality of food is not expected to be as high. 
On a positive note, I've been to a few of Wynn's other restaurants & the buffet actually has a few of the same appetizers mainly. 
The watermelon & feta sampler was selfish. It had a strawberry vinaigrette that was a free sampler from Botero before they closed their doors. They had a meat & cheese platter that you can get from Society Cafe that's tasty. Great Caesar salad. 

Now to the entrees. I actually didn't try many because I had a sleepy belligerent child. But between my husband and I, he had a big slab of beef that he said was pretty tasty (my son loved it), he also had ribs that he somewhat liked. He said that the fried chicken was surprisingly good. & I had orange peel beef in the Asian section that wasn't anything special. Unfortunately the only review I got on the street tacos was that they were lackluster :( Sad because I was looking forward to those. Side note: the crab legs tasted much better than expected. They were good for a buffet but the shrimp smelled a bit fishy so I did not try them. 

They have an abundance of sweets. I had a crepe & it was delish. I also had a cute, small chocolate cake & a cute lemon berry tart. They were both pretty good. 

All in all, the buffet was okay. I give it 4 stars because it's very clean & well put together. And I'm sure I would've enjoyed it much more if I left the child with grandma. OH! Also the staff is amazing. A manager, female with light red-Ish brown hair was a life-saver. She saw my struggles with the little one and brought him over some sweets to calm him down. She was super friendly and polite as well as the rest of the staff.  5 stars for them &  3.5 for the food (Mind you, most buffets are 1.5 in my opinion).",0,0,0

I enjoyed the mini sushi rolls, clam chowder, marinated veggies, various cold salads, fresh sliced bacon and prime rib. 

The chicken noodle soup was fine though the noodles were way too mushy and overall, it was a little salty. 

I liked the cocktail shrimp from Caesar's better as well as their sauce. Wynn's wasn't as spicy. 

I skipped all the breakfast stuff but my friends seemed to think the veggies for the breakfast burrito were too spicy. 

I didn't like the Kansas ribs. It was all sauce and not much meat. 

The eggroll I had was too much wrapper and not enough filling. 

The lemon tart was a little bit too gummy but I loved the passionfruit sorbet. I also had the fresh fruit which needed to be refreshed-- it was a poor selection of the usual watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew. I took a miniature pear that was too sour but it looked nice.

Overall, I think the meat and cold salads are worth it. The candy apples looked interesting as well as most of their desserts. The bloody mary I ended up with was too watery and the iced tea was acceptable.

Hands down the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas.

If you like king crab legs, then you're definitely in the right place.  I think they're the only buffet in Vegas (correct me if I'm wrong) that does not salt their crab legs.  Most places salt them to preserve them, which tells me that The Buffet's seafood is relatively fresh.  It's always really sweet and juicy.. yum! 

I'm sure they have whatever you like, and it's always cooked to perfection.  My personal favorites?  Crab legs.. duh..and the braised veal :)  YUMMY!!

Another thing I look forward to when I come to The Buffet..... DESSERTS!!!!  CREME BRULEEEEEEEEEE!  The tiramisu is also amazing.. and they have gelato too!  There's always a huge assortment.. it's always so hard to choose without feeling extremely guilty.

A couple of downers:
-On special holiday weekends, they totally jack up the prices.  The prices vary from day to day, but expect to pay around $30-40.    
-There's almost always a line... and it's a long line too :(

But, the pros overshadow the cons.. so I still love it!

However, having just come to the buffet again 6 years later (6 years?! Am I really that old??), I find myself badly disappointed with the Wynn buffet. First of all, no jumbo shrimp cocktail. Maybe it's a byproduct of the recession, but whatever the reason, the quality of food here has definitely tumbled downhill. Replacing the afore-mentioned jumbo shrimp were dishes of horribly overcooked fish and a pasta dish that has tiny bits of shrimp that taste really fishy.

The only things that keep me from giving Wynn's buffet a scathing 1 star rating are:

-Fresh slices of smoked salmon
-Nicely flavored flank steak that comes with a really good savory jus
-Warm bread pudding with creme anglaise sauce
-Creamy, cheesy pesto pasta

Speaking of pesto pasta, did you know that it's not supposed to be creamy? I totally didn't know that, but the hubs, who's a dirty Brit, was all, ""Dear lord, creamy pesto sauce?? Sacrilege!"" and totally turned his nose up at it. So I guess the pesto pasta's only good if you're a barbaric American like me.

Aside from the food, another good thing here's that they ply you with free juices and coffee and tea from the moment you sit down. Yes yes, I know it's a ploy to get me full faster, but I do appreciate the fact that they don't water down their fruit juices (which has happened in other buffets).

Despite these perks, however, overall the Wynn buffet did not live up to our expectations of a buffet at a 5-star hotel. There were NO shellfish (I guess they reserve the crab legs that everyone's been gushing about for dinner), on average the food was just whatever, and we left feeling really, really disappointed.

It is just an ordinary buffet where you only pay $20. This is my first time eating buffet and I did not know what to eat after my first or second plate. There is nothing to pick or choose since they dont have many variety. There sushi is very veryyyyyyyy limited (california roll is all I can see) , no sashimi. King crab leg are cold , not HOT. Not much seafood to choose. 
the Only reason I give them 1 star because they have very good lamb chop. That was all I ate that night since there was nothing else to eat. 

I think this place need to upgrade their menu or at least reduce the price if they dont want to lose more customers. Definitely I WILL NOT COME BACK HERE AGAIN for a long long time until I heard good change from them.

have been going to wynn buffet for quite some time and have been going to bellagio buffet before this one and... this one takes the cake. 

the line is normally 1hr+ wait but once you get there, you're extra hungry and it's worth it. i love the sections where you can customize your own pasta, congee, noodles, etc. 

the prime rib is too bloody for me but sometimes they'll have things like kobe beef, they usually have duck, lamb, etc. 

shrimp + crab are always good although the quality of the crab varies from time to time. there's usually always a line for seafood. who'd think that you go to the dessert for seafood haha

servers are usually pretty decent considering the amount of people they have to care for, haven't had too many problems despite the few times when i had to go without diet coke for 10 minutes. you just have to be aggressive and know how to flag them down (because they for sure will not come to you asking if things are ok)

desserts are mostly okay.. i always get a bunch just to sample them and see what's good and always with coffee. they have ice cream, cake, mousse, pie, etc. some are ok, some are AMAZING. ahhhh overload. 

the wait time is really the only thing you can complain about here... well, and your expanding waistline.",1,1,0

I got there just after one and the line was pretty short but that did not equate to getting seated quick as there were several large family groups ahead of me.

The thing that stands out The Wynn buffet is their somewhat steep price. BUT the quality is the best I've ever experienced for a LV buffet. The crab legs are of higher quality than other crab legs from other buffets because it looks, tastes and smells fresher. I found it amusing that the ready to make crepes were A LOT better than the ready to make crepes at the Paris buffet since it's a French specialty. While they do offer the variety of other buffets, their offerings are quite unique within their variety. i.e their small vegan selection, which I appreciate.

The buffet is average.  Service sucked, but that's to be expected.  You can't really judge a buffet by the service.  Price is high.  They also split us up because if you have a party of 7 or more they automatically add 18% for tip. We said it didn't matter and we could sit together, but they said they had no room for us and that it was really busy so they split us up anyways.  Oh well... It didn't really matter, but it wasn't that busy :)  I have been for dinner but this review is for both but mainly for lunch.  

Food was average (at least it was edible) 
Most of the meat was overcooked and dry (maybe I came at the wrong time)
Ahi tuna seemed frozen, definitely not fresh or it was soaked in a weird cucumber sauce.
Seafood selection was minimal at lunch.
My mom had the sushi and thought it was dry... I didn't even go near it.
The chocolate ice cream had small pieces of ice in it, but it wasn't bad.  Just made it less creamy and a little crunchy.
The lemon and apple desserts were good.  Most of the others were not (too generic... very sweet, but no depth)
I liked the Caulifower, but the brussel spouts were tough.  
Cheese selection was minimal but decent. 
 
Note: I hate wasting food so I try to finish most of my plate. In a buffet, I'll take a small portion of what looks good and try it and go back if I like it.  I can't start with a huge plate and barely eat it... I've learned traveling its wrong to waste food.

The only time this buffet is worth it is if you have picky eaters or starving crazy large appetite friends or family members.  The price for lunch is too much for what they service.  Dinner is more, but the food seems a little better... However, for the amount you pay, I'd rather be served a meal that they spend time cooking and amending if needed according to my taste.

An even greater pleasure however, is dining here during dinner.  Out of all the mega buffets that are in Vegas, very few compare to this massive upscale establishment.  With food from all around the world and various culinary wonders for tourists and locals alike, its hard to simply just pick one and go on.  The variety is obviously impressive, but the taste has always been my number one indicator for if I'm going to be back or not and I must note how good it is here.  

For those who are experienced in the world of casino buffets, this place is like a souped up Rio (Around The World) buffet, while trying to be on par with the Bellagio classy presentation.

Rather than forgetting my sorrows by stuffing my face with sweets and ruining my diet, I will instead contemplate the Buffet, where I once succumbed to baser instincts.  The Buffet at the Wynn is what you make of it: it can either be a leisurely dining experience passed in the pleasant company of friends and family; or it can be a feeding frenzy that makes you question the line between man and beast.

While I haven't had the pleasure of dining at some of the higher rated buffets in Vegas (i.e. Bacchanal), I think Wynn's Buffet ranks higher than the one found at the Aria.  Food selection and quality is, as with all buffets, varied: here, you can travel the world via themed stations, or stick to the big ticket items, like seafood and meat, that make America (dare I say it?) great.  Although all of my cravings were satisfied by this bona fide smorgasboard , I found the food less and less appetizing with each additional plate.  This phenomena is not unique to the Buffet, but I definitely regret going back for that last plate of ribs.  I probably would have been in a happier mood had the speciality drinks - some delightful guava concoction - been available throughout the duration of the meal.  Lesson learned: don't take for granted what's right in front of you; it may not always be there when you come back for seconds...

You might be hoping to win the jackpot on your favorite slot machine; I only aspire to be seated in the atrium - a spectacular room filled with natural light and brilliant floral creations.  Luck must've been on our side, as we were seated in a prime location under the glass ceiling.  That made the hour-long wait worth it.  (If time is more valuable than money, then consider paying extra for the VIP express lane.)

Our experience today has forced me to revise my opinion. We waited for an hour to be seated ( better than the 5-6 hour wait we would have had at The Bacchanal Buffet) and once seated had great service from Sandra (the only stellar thing about the experience). The once excellent high quality beef offerings have become tough dry, chewy and over salted. Where is the Kobe beef that used to be here? For $125 for two (my husband had the $16 all you can drink mimosas, bloody Mary's, beer, etc) the selection of food was so mediocre. For a holiday buffet everything seemed warmed over, salty, bitter, over cooked and even the pizza was rubbery. The best items were the salads and desserts. Thank goodness I love salad and gelato. But $55 for salad and ice cream is just not worth it. Chinese food very salty and meh. Sushi was rubbery. The crab was hit or miss depending on what piece you had. Oysters were ok. The funny thing about this buffet was that I kept going to different stations to try everything, hoping to find a winner. No luck. The final insult came when we were asked by Rhonda to leave as we had been there over two hours and there were people waiting in line for our table. I understand you have to draw the line somewhere but my husband hadn't had dessert yet and it felt so tacky after spending $125. I would not have minded if the beef had been tender and the veggies not over cooked and over salted. Shame on The Wynn. The Bacchanal is really MUCH BETTER. But Vegas is really a zoo this time of year so to really enjoy yourself wait till the holidays and conventions have abated. And avoid the Wynn until they up the quality of their offerings. It is just not nearly what it used to be.",0,0,0

At the buffet, breakfast is served until 10:30 and then lunch begins at 11.  The lunch price is more expensive...I can't remember the actual numbers.  Anyway, the food was great:  sushi, ceviches, create your own omlettes, create your own stirfry, eggrolls, asian veggies, fresh fruit, chicken parm, kobe beef meatballs, Mexican food, my favorite...enchiladas, guacamole, fajitas, 4 different types of pasta, plus a create your own pasta\/sauce combo, 5 different types of pizza, 3 different salads, 5 different soups.  I could have lived there!  

And desserts:  6 different cookies, mini versions of pretty much everything: cheesecake, tiramisu, lemon bars, carrot cake, chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, pies, bread pudding, gelato.  I could go on and on.  

I was honestly surprised by the amount of seafood on the buffet, as I usually think of buffets as places that charge for inexpensive food at large quantities...not so.  There were piles of shrimp, the ceviches, sushi, smokes salmon, clams, 5 types of fish including sea bass, tuna, and salmon.

We returned for the weekend champagne brunch, and as both my boyfriend and I don't love breakfast items, we were a little disappointed.  But, if you love breakfast, you can't go wrong there...there's so much to choose from.  

Tips:
If you go between 10:30 and 11 they will let you in for the price of breakfast and you'll have the opportunity to eat both selections...they add things for lunch.  

If you can go during the week, do.  There were so many people on the weekend and it made me feel spoiled for having been without the crowds.",1,0,0

The best buffet I have been to in my life thus far hands down (Dec. 2008).

Since we were in Vegas, we gotta save money somehow right? Since dinner starts at 3:30 and the price hikes up to $15+ more than the lunch price, we stood in line around 3:15, sampled some of the lunch items, and tasted the full dinner spread.

Where to start...

Definitely broke the bar on gluttony this time. We spent over 2 hours here until every single one of our buttons and zippers broke off. The rack of lamb was super tender, deep pink and oozing with natural juices. The cut of prime beef was tender, as rare as you want it to be, and sinfully tasty. The poached vanilla pear salad with walnuts, mixed spring greens, and a light vinaigrette topped my list for all the salads I've had in my life so far (and at a buffet nonetheless!!!), all the pastas are made well, the soups are all great, as are all the fish and seafood dishes. I made the effort, and I promise you it was a BIG one, to try at least every single item on the buffet. And nothing disappoints with the exception of the crab legs which were a little flavorless and not so fresh.

The dessert bar is spankingly the best sweet spread of all buffets I've been to. Crepe station, freshly made pastries and gelato, as well as made from scratch cobblers, pies, and puddings. Bread pudding, I do love my bread pudding, and this place does a kickass job especially for a buffet. A few of the pastries were a little on the dry side, but there are definitely winners in the bunch.

I gained at least a couple of dozen pounds from this single experience, but mark my words, this is not the last time we meet Wynn Buffet.",0,0,0

The credit card machine wasn't working, so they were manually swiping cards through the machine from 1980. I was beginning to have my doubts before we even sat down.

There is a ton of food, any kind from any ethnicity practically. I was psyched to hear that they have Alaskan King Crab Legs, so immediately headed towards those. I have to be honest and say that I was dissapointed with them though. Granted, they were split in half for easy access to the meat, but they were cold (like ice cold!!) and full of water (so much water, that it turned by butter into water), hence the deduction of one star on my review. 

They redeamed themselves with the dessert room (yes, you read correctly...its a room!). You could pretty much make a meal out it. They have ice cream, pies, cakes, crepes, shooters, cookies, the list goes on and on...

$40 a person but with all of the selection you get, plus you eat until you drop, it is well worth the price.  Especially in Vegas where all meals are expensive.  I think the higher price also keeps the kids away because parents don't want to pay that much for them to eat a couple slices of pizza, plus you dont have to deal with them running around your tables like you would see at your typical $11.95 buffet down in Old Vegas.

First, there are NO accommodations for seniors and handicap.  In the long line that we were in there were practically no people over middle age.  Most  were young.  That said with that  long line we asked to be seated first because of an elder,handicapped and diabetic senior that was with us but they refused to do so without paying $16 per person extra.  Wow, that's despicable!   No way around it according to the on duty manager!  Isn't that against the law?
So if that older person came alone they would have to wait in that 45 minute line?  Really Mr. Wynn?
Second, the price that they charge for the brunch is a rip off.   They charge you for some eggs, waffles and choices of sausage that costs them less than other foods! 
We payed nearly $36 per person and I could not fill up my plate with items that I liked.
Sure, the presentation was good as for example a small side salad was served in a cup sized strainer but overall the selection of the buffet WAS POOR !
Their green salad choices were pathetic though their desserts were pretty good. The service was attentive.

So assuming that the buffets have not changed, the Wynn buffet is definitely one of the better ones.  However, I have to take star deductions based on wait times and price.   It was a 2 hour wait to enter the buffet.  In addition, it was a 15-20 minute wait once you are inside the buffet if you wanted any seafood\/crab legs.  If you wanted to refill your plate with seafood, yep, it's still 20 minutes even if you keep your eye on the long line.  $35 for dinner per person on a Wednesday night did not help any either.

Prime rib was ok. Desserts were pretty good (especially the crunch cake).  Crab legs were perfection as could be noted by the long lines and huge piles of shells on every table.

Some of the salads were so delicious, that I purposefully made extra room for it!  Salads topped off with ""all you can eat"" candied walnuts was awesome.

My waiter was wonderful.  My dirty plates disappeared before I returned from a trip to the buffet with magically refilled cups of water.

Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers.  I think that Bellagio has a slightly higher quality and selection compared to the Wynn.

This place has a variety of different cuisines and a great dessert selection. I wish there was a bigger selection of items though...I noticed that there were only about 3 different rolls at the sushi station. They didn't even have sashimi!

What I ate:
Alaskan crab legs (LOTS)
Shrimp cocktail
Prime rib
Braised beef
Marinated lamb (w\/bone)- my favorite meat product
Salad (I got the kind served in these little cups which was PERFECT portions that didn't dirty your entire plate. they also had a regular salad bar)
grilled veggies
a bite of a shark fin won-ton thing (i thought it did not taste good but others in my group really liked it)
a bite of mahi mahi (served cool)
a bite of tandori chicken (lots of curry flavor)
bread pudding (OMG, pure heaven)
mini creme brulee
mini carrot cake
a bite of my brothers flan and key-lime pie

I love the fact that the desserts come in mini sizes so you can try a bunch of them.  (wish i had the ice cream from what people have been saying...)

Pros: My favorite dishes were the pre-cut crab legs and lamb (and ALL the desserts).  Basically everything was really good and I ate everything I put on my plate (rare for a buffet in my opinion)  

Quasi-Cons: 
Of all the food I had everything was delicious, except I wasn't a fan of the shark fin.  And the braised beef had a really nice flavor but not as melt-in-your-mouth as much as I like. The worst part about the night was there were soooo many options I had no idea what to get. (And the ~1 hour wait to eat)

Big ticket items first. The crab legs were huge and succulent. I really liked that they were cut in half, so you didn't have to fight to get your crab out of the shell. The prime rib was perfectly pink in the center.

I also had lamb osso bucco (sp?), salmon with some sort of carrot sauce, pork pot stickers, and several kinds of mussels. All of them were good.

And... the desserts. They had a nice selection of sugar free cakes and pies, but I went for the calorie laden goodies. Chocolate cake with orange mousse. A couple profiteroles. And a creme brulee better than I expected from a buffet.

Our busser\/drink server was very attentive. The boyfriend's Diet Coke was always filled quickly. I ordered a Blackberry Margarita, and they did not hold back on the tequila. She noticed the faces I was making and offered to have the bartender make me another to my liking. That's service, and definitely cemented this review at five stars for me.

Thank you yelpers.  I went to the WS for brunch on Saturday and the Wynn on Sunday.  I must say I liked the wicked spoon much better.  Here is why:

Price - 29 for WS, 32 for Wynn (non-champagne option)
Food Selection - big plus for Wicked.  I like that it's different, fresh and exciting.  The Wynn is your standard classic country club affair.  Maybe the quality is great, but the selection is same as your cruise or local casino.  Wicked Spoon has many more interesting variety.  

Food Quality -  Equal.  Wynn is quality but so was the Wicked.  I think the 
Wicked format allows for a fresher delivery.  Some items at the Wynn got cold and stale. 

Presentation and ambiance - the Wynn feels like you are in a country club with people who just got done playing tennis with wooden rackets and about to go lawn bowling.

The combination of everything just feels boring.
Please return to the Wynn so I don't have to stand in a longer line when I go to the wicked spoon.",0,0,0

I had one of our customer service reps come from PA to help me do a show at the convention center. Our Wednesday night dinner needed to be logistically simple. I didn't want to have to do reservations and then wait an inordinant amount of time to be seated. We took one of our clients with us, and we three ""did the Wynn buffet!""

In short, the layout is similar to the Hilton Hotel buffet, and frankly, I remember the Hilton spread to have been more enjoyable. I was, sadly, underwhelmed. This is not a ""kick-ass"" great buffet, as some of us remember from the late 60's and early to mid 70's; Caesar's Palace Showroom Buffet, or even the pretty decent Golden Nugget Buffet that Steve Wynn revived when he made his mark in Vegas...before he started with his strip properties. Those days, and those buffets, in my opinion, are long gone.

For me, the better food in Vegas is no longer at a buffet, but at some of the hotel restaurants, and certainly some off-strip restaurants. I'd rather revisit Vic and Anthony's at the Golden Nugget, pay my ""half a hundred"", and get a great steak, than serve myself with OK, but certainly not great buffet meats and carbs. Best thing at the buffet? The desserts. 

I'm always reassured when I see other yelper's reviews agree with mine. In this case, it's not because I'm insecure about my judgement, and need reinforcements........ it's because I want to make sure I just didn't hit them on a bad night.",11,6,9

All the food is high quality but nothing is done spectacularly, which is a characteristic that seems like is all too common in the buffet game.

My favorite buffet is still Bacchanel Buffet at Caesar's Palace. I've lined the long but fast moving lines here once for dinner and this trip for lunch. 

The lunch selection is vast, with salads, Italian station, craving station, ethnic foods, such as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, comfort foods, desserts of course, and everything ranging from hot to cold foods. There's a little bit of something for everyone. Our vegetarian friend had more of a food selection here and at buffets in general compared to other food venues in Vegas. 

I've tried a little bit of everything and some of the selections are good, and some are mediocre, but none are that great. I also tend to gravitate towards the ethnic foods and I have to say, the dumplings with the chili oil is pretty descent. The poke is descent but nothing similar if you've had a good bowl of this Hawaiian style raw fish salad. The marinated short ribs were descent as well but I think they could have done a better job with the flavors. It's sad to waste such a good piece of meat.  And I did like the smoked salmon as it was perfect with capers, horseradish, and whole grain mustard. 

I actually enjoyed the desserts more this time and some of my favorites included the guava panna cotta and mango tapioca. I tend to also try the more exotic desserts. So always make room for dessert!

I felt that if I were staying at Wynn, I would eat there for convenience but I would not make it a destination. I really want to rate it more like 3.75 stars. 

Decor: The decor was comfortable and nice. They have many different areas, some nicer than others. You may be seated in a larger area than one of the smaller more luxurious areas. 

The Service: Very respectible. From the minute the valet took my car to the return of the car, the staff were all very helpful and accomodative. 

The Food: 

- It was good but lacked the more gourmet items of Bacchanal (Caesar's), Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan), and even Bellagio Buffet. 

- They also had less of a variety than Bellagio (The Buffet), Cosmopolitan (Wicked Spoon), Bacchanal (Caesar's). The delicacy of items was also kind of lacking. 

Some examples:

- For meats, they had no lamb. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon had a great lamb which is custom seared to your liking. 

- For shrimp, they had good but not so great shrimp. Caesar's (Bacchanal) had large tiger shrimp. 

- For oysters, well, they had no oysters of any kind. 

Cospmoploitan's (Wicked Spoon) had cooked oysters but no raw ones. 
Caesar's (Bacchanal) had raw oysters.
Aria had raw oysters. 
Bellagio (The Buffet) had no oysters at all.  

- No smoked salmon or any kind of salmon. Bellagio had smoked salmon at dinner. Others may have had too.

- The sushi area was limited. There was no sashimi, mostly sushi rolls and one eel sushi. I tried none of it. 

- For desert, they had a good selection, but nothing like the giant strawberries at Bacchanal (Caesar's). I will say that the desert section was better than the rest of the buffet. 

It's very good overall but I can't see going back to it. It's good but lacks the higher-end \/ wow elements of some of the others, but avoids the mostly fried Planet Hollywood fare.",6,0,1

- Roasted cauliflower\/ fennel salad--so light and refreshing, the perfect addition to more satisfying options
- Made-to-order pasta--got the vegan ravioli with a combination of alfredo and vegetarian Bolognese sauces, surprisingly my favorite dish
- Perfectly balanced Arnold Palmer, and our attentive server continuously replenished my thirst for this top-notch, refreshing beverage

The Wynn's decor was lovely, but the food was the star. My breakfast had a lot of variety and included more expensive items like seafood and lox. There was both fresh and dried fruit. I think there was a seafood omelet in addition to the omelet station. I had lox-topped pizza. There was probably other stuff but I was too busy with the fish. 

The real awesomeness was in the dessert. Yes, I ate dessert. For breakfast.
 
And I even ate it first.

Bless their hearts, the Wynn staff had out a full dessert spread at 9 AM. Tres leche in a shot glass, lemon meringue pie, little cakes (regular and sugar-free), pastries, eclairs.  

I really love dessert. And a good dessert puts me in my happy place. This is when I close my eyes and let the flavor fill my mouth and pretty much make sweet love to my spoon, one slow bite at a time. It is sweet, creamy nirvana.

I did that in the Wynn. There was a French couple seated next to me, and the male half of the couple kept looking over at me, wondering what I could possibly be eating that was so good.

Table service was prompt, never have I returned to my seat with a dirty plate still remaining. 

They had good presentation of food items and cheerful cooking staff. 

They have a cook-to-order noodle bar and pasta station, a carving station with perfectly cooked prime rib, pizza, dim sum, salad bar, and a well-stocked seafood bar of king crab legs and shrimp. What is great about the Wynn buffet's seafood is that the crab legs are cut in half and are ready to eat. (See my photo.) Less mess, no crab wrestling, and easier to eat. I easily used chop sticks or a fork to pull crab meat out of the shell. I also appreciate how there is a staff member behind the seafood bar dedicated to restocking the piles of crab and shrimp as there is a constant line past the noodle bar to get those items. At other buffets it's like a feeding frenzy once a bucket of crab lands on the ice. 

My least favorite items were the lamb short ribs (tough, dried out meat), creme brulee (it was soupy, but I still ate two of them), sushi bar (California rolls suck and it would be nice to see more than three different sushi items), and the eggplant Parmesan (not even fully cooked). 

However, the bread selection was awesome. The Wynn restaurants make great breads and they serve the same ones at the buffet. 

The dessert selection was decent, the highlight was the ice cream parlor, which included coffee, pineapple, coconut, vanilla, and chocolate flavors.

                 Salads & Soup (asparagus, clam chowder, chicken noodle)-Ceasar, Baby Spinach w\/ creamy balsamic & candied walnuts-NOTHING special @ all! U can have better @ Soup Plantation.
                Meats-Prime Rib (only thing worth mentioning), Corn Flake fried chicken (I can make this @ home!), turkey, & typical sides like mashed potatoes, corn, & green beans. It tasted alright...
                Seafood: Crab legs (only thing worth ur money), small shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon-MEH.

Italian: Fattening pastas I didnt even bother touching...you can even create ur own & have them make it.

Indian: Typical stuff u can find anywhere! Didnt even eat it-didnt look appetizing.

Asian: Again, typical un-quality stuff u can find @ your typical Hong Kong\/Panda express. I did find the pork dumpling savory, however. Fried rice, japanese eggplant, veggie eggrolls, shrimp shu mai...
          Japanese: So disappointing!!! NO sashimi, there were only small tiny rolls-not even REAL rolls...more like Kappa Maki with overly soggy rice used. Didnt touch this either-looked totally unappealing!
         Vietnamese? I didnt check on this but the main reason why I went here is because my husband LOOOVES Pho & he said he read a review on here & someone mentioned PHO! Nope, no Pho whatsoever in sight. Disappointment.

Desserts: Have had better elsewhere as well. Creme Brule was too liquid-y. Fancy-looking desserts in shot glasses were just mere pudding. They had a crepe maker person. I didnt try it but my husband did. It looked alright. 

There were a lot of people there & we all felt so claustrophobic! Tables are small & only fit like 3 plates.",0,0,0

Maybe I had high expectations since the hotel itself is pretty fabulous. Maybe it was the hype.  Maybe it's because I hear that other buffets are even better. Maybe it's the pricing (but I think it's pretty much the same anywhere)

But saying all that, this buffet is still pretty good. They have a huge selection of all different types of food which is great. Their dessert section is my favorite, especially the creme brulee, I ate 10 plates (excessive, yes)

I do like the decoration and the fact that most of the tables are spread out from each other. Don't you hate it when you're seated so close to the other table, you're practically on their laps? I do. So I like that this buffet is definitely roomy",2,2,2

the line wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes.  once inside, the buffet was solid.  really deserves between a 4 and 5 starts, but there's no option for that, so i'll give it five.  

the food was broken up into stations.  there was seafood, italian, asian, dessert, pizza, american, salad, and charcuterie \/ cheese.

since it was brunch there was also an omelet station and a congee station.  the carving station had a slab of honey mustard basted bacon that they were cutting to order and a prime rib.  

i had a breakfast plate to start: scrambled eggs, bacon, bread, cheddar cheese and a bagel lox combo.  then i went back and got lunch stuff: a kobe beef burger, pulled pork, pad thai, spring roll, and a few sides.  

the service was no very quick to come with my drink but in fairness i didn't wait for them before going to the buffet.  they only found me my second time back at the table though, which i wasn't super pleased with.  regardless, the food was good\/great, fresh and mostly made in front of you, and at 31.95 w\/out champagne a good value.",0,0,0

King crab leg all the way on down; as you'd expect from the Wynn, they don't skimp.  It's quality food and far and away the best buffet in Vegas.  While other buffets seem to be going downhill (all while charging hefty fees), Wynn does not disappoint.  It's hardly cheap, but it's not that much more than MGM or Rio or Mandalay Bay or any of the places you'd expect to be decent that are very unmemorable.

Service here however, was horrible. Our server would clear our dishes with our utensils in it and then not bring anymore out to replace them. Were we supposed to get them on our own? IDK. We never got any drink refills either until we flagged him down to ask for one. On top of all this, my dessert plate was cleared away when I hadn't even finished it!

We were starved, I was in the mood for a surplus of shrimp cocktail, and as new locals - we have this silly goal to sample every buffet in Vegas. 

So far, since we moved to the desert 4 months ago, we have had dinner twice at the Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan, and once at the Buffet at the Bellagio. We've had lunch at the Red Rock's Buffet. And we've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the Cannery. 

Our wallets don't always allow us to visit the most glamorous of Vegas buffets, so it was a big deal for us to splurge at the Wynn. We spent a bit more than $100 for two, which included tax and tip. For this kind of money, we were expecting to be wowed. 

I'll bet you can tell where I'm going with this: we weren't wowed. Parts of the meal were solid and tasty, but other parts were forgettable. I walked away feeling ""meh"" about the whole experience. 

Items sampled:
 - Matzoh breaded fried chicken -- this was a standout for me. Crispy on the outside, and super moist and tender chicken on the inside. 
 - Beef ribs with BBQ sauce --  huge! But odd. Plenty of fat, and yet the meat was tough and difficult to tear from the bone. I enjoyed the sauce more than the rib itself. I ended up leaving a ton of meat on the bone, simply because I couldn't make a dent in the toughness. 
 - Chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce -- essentially the entire reason why I wanted to go to a buffet in the first place. But these were lackluster. The flesh was soggy, and not as meaty as I prefer. The shrimp themselves were also relatively small. Very disappointing. 
 - Fried spring rolls -- yummy! Especially with the sweet chili sauce. These were crispy on the outside and filled with veggies. 
 - Roasted Veggies -- in the Buffet's favor, they had plenty of veggies, which I appreciated. I enjoyed the asparagus, the whole carrots, and the cauliflower. Although, it must be said: some bites were better cooked than others. 
 - Prime Rib with creamy horseradish -- another standout. Very tender, and the sauce wasn't too overpowering. I enjoyed that the meat was cooked to medium. 
 - Mac and cheese -- strange flavor, and dried out. 
 - Twice baked mashed potatoes -- same as above. 
 - Sushi -- dried out, and crumbled apart when being picked up. 

The desserts were a different story, and really elevated the meal for me. I sampled the cream puffs, the creme br√ªl√©e, the cinnamon bun bread pudding, the croissant bread pudding, and the warm chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream on top. They also had candied apples and a fresh crepe station! Everything I tried was amazing. I especially enjoyed the they had two different types of bread pudding, and that both were killer. 

The Buffet is currently under construction, which makes things feel a bit cramped and confusing. Also, we weren't big fans of the layout of the restaurant -- it was difficult to navigate, and oddly organized. For example, when choosing dessert -- I picked up a warm chocolate chip cookie on one side of the dessert display, and then had to walk alllllll the way around, past the grill and the sausage stations, to the other side of the dessert display to get a scoop of ice cream to go on top. Meanwhile, the savory dinner options are laid out in a LONG line at the far back. As we overheard an adorable grandma complain, ""You mean I have to walk all the way over THERE?"" It's difficult to explain, but it feels like they don't have enough culinary options to justify it being so strangely confusing to navigate. 

All in all, I was satisfied. But I wasn't delighted. I might have enjoyed the meal more, had we paid significantly less. 

Tip: at 3:45pm on a Monday, there was literally no line. We walked right in.",2,0,0

Not throwing up or fainting but going to the bathroom 18 times over the course of the next 12 hours after the buffet.

I guess 2014 has now seen the 3rd round of cutbacks (I have been coming here for years so it's only why I notice)...if you look at the pics of some awesome looking stuff and expect to see it on the buffet you'll notice the pics were most likely from 2009-2010

Round 1 (2009)
Take away the king crab...replace with snow crab
Take away rack of lamb...replace with lamb loins
Round 2 (2012)
Take away lamb loins...replace with kobe beef
Round 3 (2014)
Take away kobe beef replace with street tacos

Also some obvious replacements were a huge ramen noodle station in place of something I forgot what used to be there. Didn't see one person in the whole 90 minutes get an entire bowl of ramen noodles...because you just paid $40 to eat more expensive food..so why would you?

The fish was way overcooked...all 3 different fish that I tried. Mahi Mahi, blackened salmon, even the sea bass...and it's hard to overcook sea bass.

The prime rib was decent.

Yeah, I'm doing a lot of complaining because it's not what it used to be in it's heyday but what really saves this place are the desserts. Probably the best buffet desserts in town (aside from Bachannal)...high quality desserts (see pics). Throw in a strawberry crepe and 3 profiteroles and that capped off my 8000 calorie meal.

I really came here with open mind but left with the same feeling that the whole experience was just ok. It had high points and low points with the food but really its buffet so hit or miss not uncommon. Maybe just over the years slowly became non fan of really any buffets would rather go for quality. 

Talk about different buffet line or maybe at the Wynn they did it on purpose too stand out from the rest. All the buffets especially ones on the strip the line is broken down into two lines with the same things and in the middle have the craving area. At The Buffet that threw me for loop thinking okay where does it start and end. I must admit depending on where you get sat makes you walk more too get your favorite spot of the buffet or just makes you want too load up extra save the trip come back. lol. Unfortunately were we got sat ended up opposite end of the crab legs, cocktail shrimp, oysters on half shell, and the sushi. Dam it. The crab legs was awesome. It nice moist, hot, and dip them in warm butter its heavenly. The oysters had couple different ones tried one not feeling it. The sushi was Terrible!! I know buffet sushi but really better off not putting any of that out. The rice was horrible, the nori was just as bad, and the fish question the freshness. The poke salad was miss too. Some of the craved items looked terrible dried out looking like the ribs, The chicken sausage was awesome. It was up and down recalling the whole line. The chicken pesto pasta and clam chowder that needs shout out! The dessert section was awesome never got around too trying the gelato. Love love the rice krispie pops that covered in white chocolate. I believe have three of them. I like the way all the desserts were displayed very elegant and even had fresh crepes. My cousin ordered on so we all shared and too be frank if they cooked the crepe more might have saved it. Bad. Three of us had one bite each like okay that enough of that one. Just like theme so many other good desserts from the creme brulee, raspberry cheesecake, tiramisu, and few more. I would still go back just make sure stay away form certain sections of the buffet. 

The service was good. Most part never had empty glasses and most part our dirty plates were gone by the time we go back from next round.

I had the clam chowder with a mozzarella and tomato salad. Then it goes to meats and cheeses with different types of dips, my favorite being whole grain mustard.  

It moves onto seafood,  pasta bar,  Mexican bar, huge hunks of meat (I don't mean the men who were in front of me)  Chinese food,  Japanese and cold seafood.

The Buffet @ Wynn used to be one of the best on the strip.  The main reason is because of the creativity of the menu.  They offered great entrees and stuff that you couldn't get at other buffets on the strip.

To some extent, the buffet @ Wynn still does that for its patrons.  You can get Indian and Thai food here, for example.  The problem is that the quality of the Indian and Thai is below average.  

Quality of the meats have dropped as well  - I felt that they didn't taste fresh.  Even ""marinated"" meats tasted dull.  

I regret to inform you guys that there was not one dish that I tried that I thought was memorable.  I didn't get seconds of anything this time, which is pretty horrible.  If you are paying upwards of $30, you should really expect a top quality buffet.  Unfortunately, you don't get that here and my review reflects that.  

Instead of this buffet, I recommend Bellagio Buffet or Wicked Spoon.   I love Wicked spoon because of its creative entrees and I love Bellagio for its amazing desserts.  I increasingly notice that M Buffet is generating a lot of buzz as a possible 3rd option.  If you want great seafood, Bellagio and M Buffet may be your best bets.  If you do, however, choose to go to the buffet @ Wynn, just consider yourself warned.  I take no pleasure in reporting that quality has dropped...it just is what it is.",6,5,5

First, my husband and I just got married on Saturday and this was our first dinner after getting hitched. Everyone told us that the Wynn is where it's at. It's the hottest buffet in town! Yeah!

Second, NO IT IS NOT. It's absurdly overpriced at more than $50 a person for dinner. 

What do you get for that princely sum? 

*Some cold crab legs (it's NOT King Crab, either, despite what others are saying)
*Shrimp cocktail (several of which weren't even deveined. GROSS. Shrimp poop does not go with prime rib) 
* A bunch of other unremarkable crap you can find at any other buffet on the Strip. 

Third, the interminable WAIT. We waited for an hour, thinking it would be worth it. We're suckers.

The prime rib was decent, however, and there was some really good mushroom risotto. But those two things in no way justify the price or the wait or the raves this place gets. The only thing that could have made our experience worse is if we had coughed up the extra $12 to skip the line. 

This only confirms my belief that the nicest hotels don't necessarily have the nicest buffets - the Bellagio buffet is no great shakes, either. Stick with the Rio or Paris and you can't lose.

As for the desserts I was not really wowed by anything but I did enjoy the creme brulee. The service there is decent, so the overall experience is decent at best.

I actually went here for an early morning breakfast meeting and the food ended up being so delicious that we forgot what most of the meeting was supposed to be about.

Generally when you see breakfast items such as eggs, bacon, and sausage you think ""well, I've had all this before and it can't possibly be anything too special, right?"" Well....you would be WRONG. The applewood smoked bacon, chicken and apple sausage, delicious hash browns, and out of this world cheese blintzes were only a small sneak peek into how incredible this buffet was. It was like I died and went to breakfast heaven, except this version of heaven was inside the Wynn Las Vegas.

- Pea & mushroom risotto
- Pancakes with apple cranberry crumble (my own creation)
- Seafood area - all you can eat lox is dangerous for me
- Gelato bar! They have about 10 flavors & toppings.

Firstly, I wish they incorporated a virtual waitlist\/line like how Caesars' Bacchanal buffet is. We literally waited in a line for 2.5 hours. 

Typical fare you'd expect from one of the better Vegas buffets. One plus is that they have a couple vegan options available, not just vegetarian items sans dairy. Vegan tacos, spring rolls, and cookies to name a few.

It definitely runs more towards the high end like the rest of the Wynn, but you certainly get some quality for your money.  Both times I've been here, my friends and I came for brunch, so I'm not really sure what the dinner menu is like.  However, if their brunch is any indication, I imagine it's pretty good.

Beyond the usual breakfast dishes (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.), they included less common items like grits and eggs benedict, and there was even an omelet station as well.  As expected, the food was pretty diverse (American, Asian, Mexican, Pizza, fruits\/salad, seafood) and there was the usual butcher station, but I was really impressed that they had congee.  I mean, it wasn't great congee, but it was still decent enough for a buffet.  My favorites were the eggs benedict and the prime rib though.  A little heavy to eat that much meat to start the day off, but it was delicious.

My friends seemed to think the desserts were pretty good, and I've seen a number of reviews mention that the creme brulee is something to try, but I can't say for sure myself (I was too full for dessert).  Overall, the food is great, but it's not cheap (about $37 a head?).  In comparison, I think Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan had more good dishes to offer (and was a bit cheaper), but I think Wynn is a little more consistent (not many misses).

Pros: Prime Rib!!! It tastes like heaven seriously. The meat melts in your mouth and is so flavorful and tender. 

Fish. Cooked to perfection. Flavorful and flaky and buttery. 

Great dessert bar. Creme brulee, strawberry shortcake, pistachio cake...even a crepe station with a very friendly server. 

Atmosphere and layout is very nice, clean, and gives off that feeling of being a high roller. 

Cons: Maybe it was a sunday night, but the snow crab legs were less than I expected. They had a slight yellow tinge in the meat and didn't taste very fresh. Probably left out during the whole day. Disappointed in that. 

Ceviche. Probably cuz Im not used to it but it didn't taste good.

The seafood was good.  When the place started serving the crab legs, the line became very long.  They had pasta and pizza here also, which my friend loved.  I skipped that section because it's heavy food.  I tasted almost every section.  The dessert section was delish.

Lets just say I was very impressed! After speaking with lots of Vegas folk, it would seem I made the right choice with Wynn. There was not much to be disappointed in. At around $50 per person (included unlimited mimosas and champagne - cheaper otherwise), I basically pigged out for about 2 hours on a large range of food - anything from sushi (average) to pizza (yum) to slabs of meat (wow!) to breakfast foods (amazing) to veggie \/ vegan options (so cool!) etc. I cant even remember everything I ate. It was so much. And every time I finished a mimosa our waitress was refilling my glass. I think I had 9 in under 2 hours. Hows that for a bargain? 

Lets talk dessert. After stuffing my face I remembered I hadn't even looked at the desserts yet - to which an entire room is dedicated! gelato, cakes, cookies, cupcakes, chocolate treats, it went on and on. 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 stars is that once in a while a food item (sushi for example) tasted just average. Not everything was perfect and even tho they had a big selection I wished there was just a little more variety.

Colorful flowers and fruits are arranged in a whimsical way, and even the layout of the eating area really impressed me -- I knew I was at a buffet, but it didn't *feel* like a buffet. I felt like we were in an intimate section of a really fancy restaurant (vs 1 of the many others here to stuff ourselves...because let's be honest, that's kind of the point). Maybe it was because there were less people, as we were there on a weekday, but either way...I loved it. 

Ok ok, enough about the decorating, I know you don't pay $27 (weekday lunch) to look at flowers. The food. was. the best!!! For context we've also been to Wicked Spoon, Wynn, and Aria. Wynn stands out for the quality and detail they put into their food. (For the record, Wicked Spoon is a close second.) Some highlights:

- The korean pancakes! This is a unique offering. I ate this twice :O I do wish that they provided fish sauce in addition to their default sweet-and-not-that-spicy sauce, but other than that, it was good.

- The Chinese fried rice is *actually fried*!! Usually buffets (even the pricey ones) seem to simply mix rice and soy sauce and call it a day, but the Wynn actually FRIED their fried rice. This makes a huge difference in texture and the Asian in me appreciated it :D (The Asian in me also said not to waste my stomach on rice, but I couldn't resist :O)

- Their polenta and tomato. Cooked perfectly! Soft and not too salty.

- Street tacos & tamales. The tamales were the best I've had in a long time. I don't know how they made it so good, but I wish I knew so I could recreate it. My husband really enjoyed the street tacos as well (I thought they were ok). 

- Bacon bits (for the mashed potatoes). These looked and tasted like 80% meat and not just fat.

- Corn chowder with hatch chile. Nice seasonal dish. Not too creamy, the right amount of spice. 

- Broccolini & roasted cauliflower (& good old carrots). I liked the variety of vegetables (veggies are important to me!), and how they were flavored to enhance their natural taste vs poured in oil and\/or cheese.

- Prime rib. My husband really liked this. He said it was tender and well-flavored.

- The ice creeeammm. Ice cream can taste unfulfilling but not the Wynn's - this was top quality. I did not crave desserts after this the way I might've after something sub-standard. Flavors ranged from the uncommon (lychee - tried it, wasn't bad) to the standard (cookies & cream - settled on this one). I liked how they had all different kinds of waffle cones to choose from (regular, dipped in chocolate with sprinkles, dipped in white chocolate with sprinkles, etc). I didn't realize the chocolate part of the waffle cone extended to the bottom, so if you are looking to save a few calories (ha!) get the regular cone.

- Crepes! Disclaimer, I didn't actually have one... I was too full to eat one :( but they have it as an option :D

The one thing I wanted to like was their mini funnel cakes with berry compote (what a cute idea!). While the berry compote was excellent (again, strong berry flavor vs over-reliance on added sugar), the funnel cake itself was too dry. I imagine it was left out too long, but so it goes.

They had a lot of good Italian and American dishes too, the desserts were lacking.  I was hoping for a rich chocolate cake or a variety of cheesecakes.  

It's a buffet, no more special than any other high end casino on the strip.

The lunch and dinner transition was weird and kind of a rip-off.  We got there at the end of lunch and were not allowed to enter, instead they lined up all the people like cattle and make them wait over half an hour to be able to charge us the dinner price!!!

I'm not a big fan of buffets, but I couldn't resist the beauty of this one and honestly I was starving that at that moment I felt like I could eat a horse.

The looks: It is BEAUTIFUL, this place looks just like the pictures you see on the Wynn's website (unlike other hotels).


Prices: for breakfast is $19.95 + tax so we went during lunch time (it starts at 11:30am) and it's like 22.95 (or 24?) + tax.  It sounds pricey, but it is so worth it!!
We got seated around 11:45am, we missed the breakfast but they still had waffles, french toast, pancakes and fruit. 

The food: It was a wide variety of food: American, Italian, Asian, Mexican & more - soups, salads, cold meats, calzones, pastas, eggs, steaks, seviche, sushi & a lot more.

Desserts: Ice Creams, caramel apples, cookies, cakes and fancy little things in very pretty containers, excuse my ignorance I don't know what they are called but they looked so good!

We sat and ate there for like a little over 2 hours, trying to try everything, but it's impossible!!! So much food, so little room in our stomachs! We would see guests at the other tables come, leave, come, leave... when we realized this we decided it was time to go...haha!
It was kind of embarrassing, but whatever, will I ever see them again? no! and the people at the restaurant won't remember me, so just eat, eat, eat try to sample everything...who cares!

I recommend you pace yourself, haha, and save room for dessert, cus I didn't and I only got to try the ice cream :( Which was delicious, I got 1 scoop of coffee ice cream and a scoop of something else, I forget what it was but it was soooo good!

I show up to pay for my breakfast only to be asked ""Are you a guest here?"" I say no but I am staying nearby. The man working replies ""Sorry but we can't let you in looking like that"" I said that I had looked online and there was no specific dress code regulations and that none of my lady parts were out, just my belly button. He still refused to let me in. Luckily I had my mothers old, oversized shirt in my bag. I put the shirt on and it was literally so big it went down to almost my knees. He told me ""That is ok"" and then let me in. I was completely embarrassed walking around the buffet. People were looking at me with stares and giggles because I was wearing a shirt 4 times my size. The part that pissed me off the most was that about 15 minutes into breakfast, a young lady comes in wearing a shirt where her WHOLE BACK was showing with NO BRA so her lady bumps were sticking out from the side. SO TELL ME, WHY ON EARTH WOULD I BE FORCED TO COVER UP WHILE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO WEAR SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE REVEALING. She got to enjoy her meal in peace in the comfort of her own body while I was honestly embarrassed to even get up from my table.

First of all I don't think I've ever been to a buffet where there are no salads available or no salad bar. The only thing they had was a pole potato salad some cabbage and quinoa and fresh fruit which is always nice but I wouldn't call that a salad.

And since the folks were visiting, we found ourselves walking in around 3:15 on a weekday.  The cool thing about coming around this time is that you pay the lunch price, but the dinner food starts coming out.  And you definitely beat the crowds - both in line and when you're getting your food.  Going early is definitely worth it then for those reasons! 

Like Caroline C. said, the interior reminds you of a Martha Stewart wedding with the pastel colors, flowers, and fake fruit displays.  Not only do they have a long list of food to choose from, but they present it pretty nicely too.  And the descriptions sound a lot better as well.  They know that visual presentation helps with selling the food here!  You definitely don't see this style of buffet at the other casinos! 

Highlights when I went were the snow crab legs and drawn butter, ravioli in mushroom cream sauce, various toppings for their ice cream, and the creme brulee.  

Service was okay.  There was a shift change when we arrived (Jesus greeted us, but Chris took over right away), so I think the person taking over our table overlooked us.  Beverages were only refilled when asked and dirty dishes were never cleared unless requested.  (We noticed Chris was a lot more friendlier to the other tables beside us and I think it's because he didn't know we just had sat down as well.)

Overall, it's a pretty expensive buffet in Vegas.  Not the most expensive in town, but very much up there.  It's only worth it for dinner if you can eat your fair share and you're not a vegetarian.  Otherwise, come during lunch instead!

After waiting 30 minutes in line I found out it was 35 bucks a person.  That is a lot of dough for breakfast and we really weren't that kind of crazy hungry to take advantage of such a meal.  I read an article that said it was worth going for so we did but I should have done a bit more research before waiting in line.

Price aside this buffet was colossal in size.  I'm talking prime rib, sliced turkey, Mexican, Italian, yogurt bar, omelet bar, pancake bar, fresh fruit, Asian food, seafood, bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes, mash potatoes, and a HUGE room full of pastries, ice cream, etc.  You name it and this place probably had it.

There were a few things that were quite good: watermelon lime juice, prime rib, and mash potatoes come to mind.  The rest was...well...pretty much buffet food.  A lot of it I took one or two bites out of then tossed to the side.  I am not a wasteful person but it just wasn't worth eating.

We ended up at the Wynn Buffet at lord knows what time for brunch\/lunch\/early dinner. There's a lot of food dude!!!! How do you choose!

I ate a LOT. Shrimp cocktail here we go again. The food in general was pretty good. Service was lacking but they were busy as heck so I didn't complain too much. Everything was clean. No drips everywhere around the buffet area itself. I thought it was a bit too spread apart, but it was still organized well. The crab legs sucked here though. Cold and cut in half? Not my cup of tea. 

It's definitely a bit pricey ($32 after tax I think), but it was a good experience. Wait wasn't too bad. We all got to sit together. 

OH! The ONE thing I reaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly loved about eating at buffets in LV was that you could eat, take a smoke break at your table, digest, and then go for more rounds. NOW YOU CANNOT DO THAT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What's the deal with that dude? UGH!

Figuring I could use something to kill time, I picked one up and started perusing the contents.  On one of the pages was listed the top 10 buffets in Vegas.  I figured, ""Well, Rio has to be at the top with Bellagio 2nd and going on from there..."", but was surprised to see that Wynn was ranked #1, Rio #2, and Bellagio #4!!!

So I did some research and learned that the Wynn seems to be the new rage in buffets on the strip, so we decided to check it out.  We arrived at around 7 and waited for about 45 minutes before getting on a Saturday evening.  Not too unreasonable.

We were eventually seated and provided drink orders then went to town.  Here were some of the highlights:

Pre-cut cold King Crab legs - This is my favorite part of every buffet.  King is king, and if they are hot legs they are the best, but most buffets do cold legs to keep them lasting longer.  The line for the seafood was the longest in the buffet, and it was worth it.  When I finally got to the crab legs with my giant empty plate I started putting them on while a working behind the counter started gathering a ton of them in his gloved hand.  He then asked me if I wanted what he had collected on my plate.  I said yes, and instantly my collection of 3 legs with tongs turned into around 15.  I added a few more and got some drawn butter and the rest is history.  Awesome legs.

Braised short ribs - Only slightly dry if not in the sauce, but the meat literally fell of the bone and shredded easily with a fork.  Very tender and flavorful.

Pumpkin Ravioli - I don't really like sweet food for dinner items, but these were excellently done with great texture and flavor.  The spice was really present and enhanced the item well.

Lamb Chop - Super tender and tasty.  Again, fall off the bone goodness.  A little fatty, but easily trimmed away.

The ice cream bar - It's like a Coldstone or a gelato bar... Tons of ice creams.  They also had crepes for those interested.

I tried a little of everything, and these were the things that really stood out to me.  The rest was average and not overly impressive.  The thing is, I would want to compare this to Bellagio since it took the number one spot and highlight some of the differences between the two that might help you decide which is better for you.

Bellagio Pros:
Better variety (Beef Wellington, Venison or Buffalo, etc)
Lower price
High quality

Wynn Pros:
Crab legs are cut in half for easy access (if this applies to Bellagio, then forgive my forgetfulness and remove this item)
Lamb chops
Ice cream and crepe bar

In general, both have tons of desserts (of which most suck), and lots of standard items like salad, pasta, tacos, prime rib, etc.  The Wynn presentation for food was higher (nice pictures taken by one of my friends), but the Bellagio offers a better deal; better bang for the buck.

Summary: Most of the food was good.  Some of the food was great (crab legs, short ribs, ice cream bar).  Food presentation was excellent.  But when it comes to overall deal for the price, it's not worth it.  Bellagio seems a better deal with greater variety and comparable quality for less.",1,0,0

The Wynn was the most highly recommended buffet in Vegas, and since this was my first time in Vegas, I had to go to at least one!  Dinner, however, seemed too expensive and breakfast seemed too expensive for breakfast food, so we decided to go for lunch one day.

Bottom line: it was worth it!  With tax, it comes to a bit less than $25, but you get sooooooo much food.  And it's good!  Asian, Italian, Seafood (ceviches), American, and so much more.

My favorite part was the sea bass which was cooked perfectly.  Incredible.  I could eat more and more and more of that.  I also liked the beef flank steak, and some other things.  I didn't get to try everything, but I came pretty close.  Then, to finish it off, I saw the dessert bar.  So.  Much.  Dessert.  I got one of everything that sounded remotely good to me, and tried it all.  The flavors of the desserts were pretty intense.  My favorite, surprisingly, was the oreo chocolate cake thing.  Usually don't love Oreo (though I don't dislike it either), but it was delicious!  I'd suggest getting a large spread and trying bits of everything and sharing with some people.

The only complaint I might have is that I was too uncomfortably full afterward.  Why, Wynn, why?!",3,3,3

The family recently took a trip to Vegas because we were craving good food.  The difficulty was in finding child friendly places, as we have a 1 year old cranky brat of a child.  We figured we'd go to the Wynn buffet for lunch, since buffets are notoriously child friendly.  

For a Tuesday, the line was longish (we waited for 30 minutes holding the baby the whole time (Wynn doesn't allow strollers to discourage kids, I suppose), and the food wasn't so great.  They didn't have any prime rib or crab legs, and only a little bit of fish.  We got the feeling that they used leftover meat from the buffet last night to create their lunch dishes.  For instance, they had turkey and prime rib sandwiches, as well as spicy tuna hand rolls.  The dessert wasn't so great, either.  There was no creme brulee, for instance.

For 20 bucks a person, I guess it wasn't bad, but considering the dinner buffet is generally pretty good, I'd expect a LOT more out of the lunch buffet.  Bleh.  I would definitely NOT go back to the lunch buffet, and, based on this recent experience, would maybe think twice about visiting the dinner buffet again.",0,0,0

The Wynn buffett, on the other hand, is not one of said buffets. It's just one step above mediocre. And it could quite possibly be elevated solely by the aesthetics of the place.  Very pretty and lush ornamentation (just like the rest of the casino)...I noticed while we were standing in line that the walls appear to be covered in ivory ostrich skin. 
Just like all the other Vegas buffets (because there IS a distinction), the Wynn buffet is broken up into styles of food: pasta, salads, seafood, ""Asian"", grill, soups, desserts, etc.  
Some highlights:
Witnessing obscene gluttony: freaking lady with 10 king crab legs on her plate clutching it to her breast as if we were going to steal them off her plate
Customized noodle bowls- unfortunately the veggie broth, bland egg noodles, bland chikken really disappointed me
Fresh-made crepes, however, saved the day... with options of strawberries, blueberry syrup, razz syrup, nanners foster, or whatever creative mess you put on it.

I love Bacchanal and it's hard from me to break away from it, but I decided to brand out and try the Wynn on my last vegas trip. I am very happy I did, because for a fraction of the price I believe it is on par. 

The line was rather light, which is always great, and I absolutely love the decorations. The deserts are located in the center and it's hard to not first notice the rotating gelato case or the multi chocolate fountain.  

While it's admittedly not as big as some of it's competitors, it makes up for it with shear quality. Nearly everything was on point. There were a few items that put it over the edge.

In particular, the tomahawk steak. If you love a good streak than this buffet is worth it for the steak alone. I ate....a ton of the stuff. It now lives as one of my Top 3 steaks of all time, which is really saying something. 

Other things like the dim sum, crab, mac n cheese, and street tacos were also A+.

round 1 : Carvery 
Bacchanal: Terrific Leg of Lamb.  OK sausage.  OK Ham.  Tasty (a bit salty) briskey.  Salty pork rib (No BBQ sause) .Missing Prime Rib?
Wynn: Best beef rib.  Juicy prime rib (I waited for a good piece), didn't touch anything else.
winner: wynn

round 2: seafood
Bacchanal: Amazing selection.  Fresher oysters.  Creative mini dishes.  Spectacular soups.  good support of sauces
Wynn:  lacking in options.  Very good cold king crab legs.  small oysters.  
winner: bacchanal

round 3: sushi (i know its seafood...)
bacchanal: why bother?  5 different rolls and sushi combo?
wynn:  not much better, but they did have a very delicious seaweed salad.
winner: wynn

round 4: World assortment (so i clumped it up..)
bacchanal: pho\/udon station, cheese and ham station.  Italian station that served steamed crab (bonus point for seafood).  Wagyu beef sliders ( overrated..).  Good looking chinese food station.  Nice assortment of fruits and salad. 
wynn: nice dim sum platter, specialized salad dishes, a lot of italian inspired foods, points for ramen station. 
winner: bacchanal.

round 5: dessert
Bacchanal: gelato, cookies, creme brule, crepe, cakes, creme buffs, candied snacks
wynn: same
winner: tie.  This should have been the wynn's but I think they pulled back some items that used to be there... disappointing.

I feel bad for making my boyfriend take me here and spending all that money because I didn't end up enjoying it. $40 dollars per person for dinner yet the food was mediocre? I remember going to the Bellagio buffet a couple of years ago and it was way better and cheaper, $28 per person only on a weekday.

Although the selection was not bad, every dish I've tried (and I tried a little bit of almost everything) was either undercooked, overcooked, or bland. I was looking forward to the Chillean sea bass but the quality of the fish was clearly no good. The fish tasted EXTRA fishy, kind of dried out rubbery at places, and it had the texture of cheap tilapia. It was definitely not the melt-in your mouth texture I was hoping for like so many other reviewers have mentioned. I love sushi but I did not even bother with the sushi rolls because it looked dinky and ""poked"" at. I remember the sushi at the Bellagio was actually pretty good.  Whenever I visit any buffet, I have to stuff my face with crab just to make my meal worth it. The crab legs at the Wynn were disappointing, too. There was a long line to get them so I thought they would be awesome but to my dismay, they were cold and sitting on a bed of ice! I quickly found out that you can go to the grille section and get them warmed but come on, cold crab legs and the only option is to warm them on the grill? At the Bellagio, they do the same, cold crab legs split in half, but least you can ask the chef to heat it up with some butter sauce.

The rest of the foods were not memorable at all. The dessert section had a huge selection including gelato and a crepe station but nothing tasted out of the ordinary. They were mostly pastries and petite cakes that looked amazing but when I tried them, they tasted like pure fondant! Who the heck wants to eat desserts that taste like pure confectioner's sugar? There was no fluffy pastry\/cake texture and even the chocolate desserts did not taste very chocolatey.  I've had better more creative gelatos and the crepe station was not a hoot either. The toppings were mostly frozen and preserved fruits and there was no utella. How do you have crepes without nutella??

Overall the ingredients put into the food seem fancy smancy (exotic herbs, spices, and what not) and they have fancy smancy names, but the quality, presentation, and  culinary skill was just not there. What a disappointment. I will be going back to the Bellagio next year.",0,0,0

At around 4pm, the line was just at the entrance, which I was told, made for an hour and 15 minute wait. We checked back at around 4:40pm and they had started a secondary line across the hallway. There were about 6 groups ahead of us in the secondary line. Took us about 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to the pay station and another 15 minutes to get seated at our table.
Setting: Very nice setting overall. The tables were adequated spaced so that you were not bumping into people at the other tables. The food stations were efficiently divided with virtually no wait except for the seafood\/crab leg station. The wait at the crab leg station was about 10 minutes. However, they were constantly replenishing the crab legs, so you don't have to worry about running out or getting the leftover remnants. The other stations were divided into salad, soup, hot fish and meats, carving (prime rib and rack of lamb), Chinese\/Asian, pasta, vegetables, and seafood\/sushi.
Wait staff: fairly efficient and friendly, delivered drinks fairly quickly, and removed dishes ok.
Noise level: average for a buffet.
Strategy: With the exception of the crab legs, get very small amounts of everything that interest you. After you have decided what is really tasty and worth the calories, concentrate on those items. Otherwise, you'll fill yourself on poor quality items and not have room for the good stuff. Another strategy to consider is have one person in your party stock up on a pile of shrimp and crab legs for your entire party (there is no limit on how many you can get at one time), sparing everyone else the wait in line. 
Food: Overall, for a buffet, the food was pretty good. They used high quality ingredients and there was small enough portions that food was being replenished on a regular basis. The rack of labs was pretty good, mostly moist and meaty. Did not try the prime rib. The rest of the meat and seafood dishes were somewhat dried out, with the exception of the halibut. Tried the lamb neck T bone, grilled pork chops, veal, salmon, and couple other fish dishes. All were dried out from being in the steam tables for too long (can't seem avoid this problem at any buffet). The sushi was pretty plain, could get better sushi at Whole Foods. The shrimp were large and peeled (but to be honest, can't do much to ruin plain shrimp). The crab legs were large and abundant.  The desserts were pretty good. The homemade ice cream and sorbets were good, tried their chocolate, vanilla and coffe. The pastries were ok, not much better than most other buffets. The cookies were a couple notches better than average. Overall, this is the best buffet I've tried both in Las Vegas and other towns. However, given the price of $40 per person, would not consider it a bargain if you look at the cost per quality of food. You can probably get much better meal off the strip at some non-buffet restaurant. However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration. Considering the other buffets available, might as well get some quality with the calories.
The three stars is for the better than average food for a buffet, highest cost of any buffet, and the average wait in line.",0,0,0

I went here for my bday dinner and I would have to say it was worth it.  Prime rib was good, cheeses and cuts of meat were decent.  i was mostly here for the king crab legs which I was craving badly and had to have some pronto.  Only disappointment was they didn't have king crab it was the smaller version.   Oh well its probably not in season but  I guess it sufficed beacuse it calmed my crusteacian cravings.

Wynn was the best by far. The wait sucked (the line was short but we still had to wait for 30-45 min at 8pm) and the waitress spilled stuff on my jacket when she dropped a plate (oops).. but the staff was nice and they tried to fix the situation right away. 

All in all, everything that I had was delicious. I love the little salad in cups. The crab legs were good. I generally skipped the normal stuff like pizza (because why would you go to a buffet to get pizza?!). 

The only things I didn't like were the baba ganoush (dear GOD that was awful tasting) and the desserts station. The crepes were pathetic, and the fruit filling was watery and gross. I'm sure when they charge you over $40 per person, they can afford to include fresh fruit (fresh bananas? come on, not that difficult!) with the crepes. The only cake thing I liked was this pumpkin gingerbread thing.. even then, it was way too sweet to eat. Creme brulee was okay.. but I find that every buffet in Vegas makes their creme brulee really watery\/thin\/mushy. Bleh.

The portion sizes were good, so I was able to sample most things. I think I'd consider coming back next time....

It was an early dinner so I didn't have to deal with the crowds, which was an excellent idea. I started off with the lobster bisque which was sub par. Very salty and not much flavor; I personally prefer the one from Texas de Brazil.  The selection of food was great, but some of the items fell short of my expectations. The Peking duck was a huge letdown, but the shrimp shumai made up for it. The Prime Rib was excellent, and was the highlight of the dinner. Although I wish they would cut a thicker slice than the deli cut I received. Beef ribs and pork belly were delicious. Pork belly was similar to char sui  (bbq roast pork) with a similar glaze which was incredible. I think one of the highlights of their buffet is the dessert station which was very extensive, from a gelato station to individual servings of classic desserts like guava pannacotta and cheesecake. Make sure you save room for dessert! Service and decor was incredible as well. Would definitely come back but wish they would improve some of their Asian options.",0,0,0

However based on my experience dining in the Buffet at the Wynn, I will utilize this review for some constructive criticism with a few kudos. A combination that will accumulate in a 3 star review.

  The Buffet at the Wynn is a dining area of elegant surroundings. I had the experience of dining in an indoor garden. It was an experience made better with seeing the sun as it shined through a glass ceiling. It was an experience supported through a $25 daily lunch price.

  With so much investment in a luxurious interior, why was there so little in training? The service was mediocre at best. After the friendly hostess seated us, we kept waiting and waiting for a server. Finally we had to ask the hostess to send a server to our tsble. Why? In the Mirage, the very hotel that Steve Wynn created, on the spot the Cravings Buffet server asked what we wanted to drink. Ditto for economy buffets that include the Fiesta. Just like miso soup at the Wynn, the service was relatively nonexistent. It seemed that our friendly server was more interested in chatting with another server than taking care of our table. During desert, I had to walk up to him to kindly ask him for more coffee.

  And the coffee is another area that constructive criticism hopefully could improve. When people are paying good money for a buffet, they appreciate when the server pours fresh coffee into their cup instead of a pot of coffee that had hot temperature challenges. To get to the chase the coffee fell short of the hot temperature and taste that I expected.

  Further constructive criticism of the Buffet at the Wynn is numerous food stations with so few choices. The stations themselves are commendable.  They are Shell fish, chilled sea food, Asian, The Grill, American, Italian, Pizza, Seafood, Salad, and Specialties. But the selection is lacking. The most obvious example is the soup selection. There were only like three soups in the whole buffet. To my eyes it wasn't quantity over quality. The chicken noodle soup appeared to be mostly chicken and barely noodles. Where were the mushrooms in the Vegan Cream of Mushroom soup? Where were the soups that the people love? I would have appreciated if I could of chowed down miso soup, won ton soup, hot & sour soup, or egg drop soup. I was disappointed that I could find the standard buffet offerings like salmon but no shrimp or scallops. I could go on and on. But I want to address the point that each station had only a few choices, the antithesis of the Rio Buffet and when you get down to it a Feast Buffet. And my taste buds found little difference between the egg plant parmesan here and at the Orlean's Buffet. The small selection extended to the ice cream selection. I do not recall seeing gelato. I am sure that the common flavor of strawberry was nonexistent. And the scoop of the delicious capucinno ice cream was remarkably small at the same time of being a scoop short of the ice cream served at the majority of buffets.

   I give kudos to some of the live stations. The Kalhi marinated steak was delicious. And I also thought highly of the shrimp and pork dumpling with garlic sauce.

  The deal is that I work very hard for my money. Put it this way, I am not one of those guys that is going to drive out of the Wynn Ferrari dealership in a new Ferrari. But, sometimes constructive criticism goes a longer ways than the wheels of a Ferrari from a Wynn show room. With that said, in the near future I intend patronize what I consider better buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. Regardless I still give Steve Wynn an Internet ^5.",12,7,8

The food was amazing, the casino and the buffet are beautiful, and the service was excellent. After a ten dollar tip it ended up costing us about $40 per person for the whole thing, but it was well worth the price.

The thing that makes this buffet stand out in my eyes is their ability to work with people like us with food sensetivites and special dietary needs. I haven't bothered going to a buffet since I was diagnosed gluten (celiac) and dairy intolerant over two years ago. I am extremely sensetive to even the smallest amounts of gluten or dairy, so a buffet didn't seem like a good idea. After reading a few reviews on a few blogs my fiance and I decided to give it a shot, and boy are we glad we did!! The chef came out and gave us a tour of the whole buffet, showing us what was safe and what was not. They had a LOT of options for us including several deserts (which pretty much never happens), all of which were delicious!

salads- not too much of a variety. pretty small salad bar. but i did like the barley salad, that was nice.

fish- i was bit disappointed with the sea bass, it was defintely over cooked, same with the catfish. however, the one good fish was the red snapper. eat that one.

meats- it has all the standards. most of the meats tasted overdone. the only one that was worth getting seconds was the prime rib. 

seafood - the crab legs were disappointing. defintely defintely tasted frozen and thawed out. to make things worse there was a long line. shrimp also tasted like they were cooked, then frozen, then thawed. typical standard fare of smoked salmon and california rolls. 

miscellaneous - well the mashed potatoes were really good! i always get in trouble for eating mashed potatoes at buffets.. my mom yells at me and says i should eat something more expensive =)

desserts - i didn't get a chance to eat the gelato cuz there were too many people. but u could make sundaes with them. the other stuff was knda good. lotsa pies, pudding type desserts.

Talk about selection. Everything you could want they have! The food was delicious, the quality was great. My favorite was the Salmon and mac n cheese. I know of all the food that was my favorite? YES it was!

Christmas morning, we arrived in line for the buffet at 11:07am (7 minutes after it opened) and there was a long line already. So what do we do? We get in line. I hate buffets. I hate waiting in line even more. However, it WAS Christmas and I did agree to hubby's request of wanting to eat here. He's been wanting to eat at the Wynn buffet the last few times we visited but I said no.

So there we were standing in line. Mind you, this isn't even the the line leading into the buffet. This was the line against the wall on the opposite side of the buffet. This is where you get a full view of all the people eating INSIDE in the dining room and all you can do is wait.

The line moves slowly. Luckily a friend was with us and so we were chatting. When the Wynn girls walked around passing out complimentary bottled water I was highly impressed and decided that the hotel was superb in customer service but still, the damn buffet better be mindblowingly good (yeah Frank K -- his suggestion for the Wynn buffet) to compensate for this waiting.

Believe it or not, but exactly 2 hours later we were at the front of the line, but not before forking over 50 bucks per person (lil guy was half price) tax included to go in for the ""Christmas Feast"".

After we were seated, we made our way to the buffet. I was impressed by the lack of pushing and shoving along the buffet line. In fact, there just seemed to be very few people in the dining area. It then dawned on me that they make you wait because they didn't want their dining area to look and feel like a cafeteria which is essentially what a buffet is all about. This way, it still feels extremely civilized even though you're going through the lines like you do at a cafeteria and helping yourself to food.

PROS: Peel and eat shrimps were already peeled and were large instead of the regular miniature sized ones you get at other buffets. The Alaskan King crab legs were fresh and not frozen. There was also smoked salmon, white anchovies, smoked trout and other smoked fish. Lobster\/shrimp bisque was excellent.

CONS: Although there was an abundance of meat such as lamb chops, the chops were overcooked and really dry. I was so disappointed that they ruined the lamb chops. The prime rib was rather good but again, I only like the end piece and it was really dry like jerky. The lamb shank was again over cooked.

There was also Chinese food including a few items of dim sum and roasted duck, Italian selections (which included thin crust pizza -- lackluster), a fish station with things such as halibut wrapped in bacon and a soup station. Like I said the bisque was fabulous but the french onion was way too salty. 

I think the Wynn uses really great ingredients to put their buffet together, but the execution of it was poor. They ruined great cuts of meat by overcooking and ruined the ceviches by bad marinades. For 50 bucks I had expected a lot more. The variety was very minimal as well for the 50 dollar price tag. I had expected a lot more variety especially since it was called a ""Christmas Feast"".  The regular dinner buffet is usually 10 dollar less but even so, if this was all they served I would say at 40 bucks a pop it was overpriced as well.

The desserts were hit and miss. The creme brulees were torched on site before placing on the shelves, but the creme itself was watery. The sorbet and gelato were also hit and miss in flavor depending on which one you got. I did enjoy the cheesecake and the sago (tapioca) pudding.

To have waited 2 hours for this meal garners it a mediocre rating at best. Not worth a 2 hour wait and definitely not worth its 50 dollar price tag.",8,3,4

I enjoy all of the restaurants and service at the Wynn\/Encore establishment and my last venture at The Wynn Buffet was great so this is where we decided to dine for dinner for their special Memorial Day dinner.

We got their early before the buffet was too busy as we had a show later that evening.  The service was excellent.  They cleared the plates fast. Drinks were refilled and drinks we ordered off menu came out fast as well.  

The food quality was not as good as in the past.  The tomahawk steaks looked amazing but I got huge pieces of grissle with little meat. I tried twice before I gave up. The bar-b-que ribs and brisket had an indiscriminate rub with no flavor. 

The fish my wife had she didn't feel was fresh.   On the other hand, the matzoh coated fried chicken was extremely tender and juicy but the coating wasn't flavorful.   The carne asada for the tacos was also exceptionally tender but not\/under seasoned. 

In the deserts just the gelato was worth eating. But beware the name doesn't always match the flavor. The toppings for the crepes were what looked like canned fruits and not something that was worth the line and we skipped.  The turnover of the rest of the desserts was low and the banana cake I got was hard. 

Within thirty minutes after we left my brother in law developed diarrhea. My wife and I both developed diarrhea within the hour. Between the time we left the buffet and went to our show it was only one hour and I had to use the toilet four times. Needless to say we were late four our show. I was afraid to drink anything in fear of more explosive liquid stools   As I write this it's been 13.5 hours since we left the buffet and I still have diarrhea.

I recommend going during lunch time because it will be less crowded and costs much less than dinner.  If you can go on less busy days of the week (such as most weekdays), it might cost a little less.

I actually thought it was cool how there was a congee station -- however I personally like my congee thick. The congee was a bit watery for my taste and the rice was a bit thin. 

I am a cheese fanatic and I was so excited to see a meat and cheese station when I first walked in. I tried each type of cheese and only ended up disappointed. It was dry and bland. :( My cheesy heart hurt at that moment.

All in all, the grapefruit gelato made my stay at the Wynn buffet. It had the perfect ratio of that tart and sweet flavor. Other flavors were delicious as well (espresso, vanilla bean, strawberry, etc). :]",2,2,2

The food, the service, the colorful bright garden (where we always sat) were a perfect combination. I must have eaten 30 of those creamy cheesy perogies and a dozen scoops of the Salted Caramel chocolate gelato. 

The crab legs were the best I have ever had, not over cooked like so many of the other buffets I had been to and even better than most of the a la carte seafood restaurants I have visited. They were succulent and juicy, and sweet. Oh so sweet. The next day they brought out stone crab claws too! I was in heaven. 

The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed Henry. He was top notch. The manager was also quite sweet and kind. Now that I am home, I am losing a bit of the weight I put on while I was there. All I can say is it is a good thing I don't live in Vegas.",0,1,0

I think that if they are charging around $40, it better have at least 4 stars.  There was a 40 minute wait at around 8:00 on a Sunday night.  We didn't want to wait so we chose to pay the extra $16.00 each to bypass the line.  Totally worth it, and you can choose a free sangria, mimosa or white wine spritzer.  

Happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  Almost everything I ate was good.  I say almost because, I didn't care for the lamb meatball or the fact that the crab legs were still a little frozen.  

The Asian choices were pretty good.  They have some Dim Sum, Duck Buns and fried rice with Chinese sausage.  I enjoyed the sushi with the Japanese Takuan (radish)cucumber, and gobo.  

I didn't try any of the carving station items but they did have Matzo Flour Fried Chicken(kind of like Brooklyn Bowl). It was really good.  I also enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder.  You don't see that clam chowder very often.  

For dessert, I thought the Cracker Jack cake was delicious and the Green Tea  cupcake was pretty good too.  Overall a really good Buffet but just not as good as the one down the street in that palace....",4,1,2

Most recently, I had the Wynn Buffet during me and Hubby's Las Vegas New Year's\/Anniversary trip. We had the special NYE buffet, which included steamed LOBSTER!

Hubby and I proceeded to devour plate after plate of steamed lobster, king crab legs, and cocktail shrimp.

I have to say, it was the best buffet experience I've had in Vegas. And Hubby agrees. Another bonus was that we didn't even have to wait in line at all, which almost never happens at the good buffets in Vegas.

Needless to say, we both had massive food coma and had to go up to the room to digest (him) and pass out for an hour (me). I did wake up in time to watch Jersey Shore and see Snooki get punched in the face, and eventually I was able to crawl out of bed to watch the fireworks, but the food coma ensured that watching fireworks was all that we had the energy to do for NYE.

What sucks is that, we came here as our last hurrah lunch before heading home, having eaten many delicious meals- we were pretty disappointed.
I should have listened to my gut feeling after seeing rates of this place dropping in their latest yelp reviews.  It wasn't unsavory looking as the lower end ""buffet of buffets"" buffets, but it certainly made me wonder what i would be getting if i spent that 40 bucks for dinner on a peak day. Would it be that much better? Or more of the same stuff... A whole station devoted to tortilla chips with only red and green salsa was a bit of a turnoff. 
The dishes i did enjoy were some pork slider thing, leek dumpling, bacon, and hashbrown ball. They had a small selection of Thai and indian food which you dont' find everywhere- but they were ordinary.  What we found ourselves doing, was mixing up some of the dry dishes with the saucy items to make things more interesting... eating our cookies with the icecream or frosting off the cupcakes.

So we invited some local friends (all doctors) and went ... What a disappointment!! All 12 of us decided we would NEVER go there again! The food was bland and very average, some items quite bad ... I've seen better salad bars at The Sizzler! The only memorable item according to everyone at the table was the pea risotto! They had something named Kobe meatloaf - almost dog food! IF indeed they used Kobe beef, it was a waste of good meat! The crab legs were easy to eat and OK tasting ... The last time we were there they had a smoked breast of duck salad that was awesome - GONE! Lamb chops - available only Friday and Saturday I was told. Now - even the desserts were blah! 
The worst part of the experience is that for some of us who wanted to smoke, we weren't ALLOWED to go in the casino. Four different people (including the manager) came to tell us that once we're in, we cannot exit and re-enter, as if we were trying to sneak in without paying. At some point they cleared the table including the champagne glasses that we paid extra for ($10\/person) and they kept coming to ask if we needed anything else. By the way, the place was quite empty, no line to get in, they just had enough of us. We are locals, used to the treatment we get at Station Casinos such as Red Rock and Green Valley Ranch, or the M Resort, where the buffets are better and nobody keeps you hostage in the room if you want to go out for a smoke!!! I wonder if Steve Wynn is aware of how ridiculous the policies are in his hotel! The worst $85 spent on a mandatory tip for a group of our size for the lousiest service we've had in years! And the crappiest buffet food for $597.11 for 12!

 Don't worry buffet managers, you won't have to deal with our kind EVER AGAIN! Not only that, but we will strongly discourage all our local friends, relatives and business associates from ever coming to your establishment again!

I'm afraid I came to the Wynn with overly high expectations, after looking through several hundred of the lovely photos of beautifully presented food that people have posted on Yelp.

There was indeed a lot of food.  All beautifully presented!  A few things were great.  A few things were not very good.  But most of it was pretty mediocre -- all style and splash and no substance (much like most of Las Vegas, actually.)  The desserts in particular were disappointing. They were plentiful, and they looked beautiful, but only one or two were really any good.

As others have said: DEFINITELY arrive in time for the end of lunch\/beginning of dinner transition. You pay the lunch price and get the dinner food (such as King Crab legs) too!

A tip: while you're there, sign up for a player's card at the Wynn. You get some free play ($10, I think), and the free cocktails that the roaming waitresses serve are actually *really* good, if you are lucky enough to get one. (Don't forget to tip your waitress well!)",0,0,0

Here's the deal: you pay $40 for decent decor, a wide selection of food, and an excellent desert bar. 

You also pay $40 for TERRIBLE service, and food that ranges from decent to kinda iffy. I swear, maybe I'm getting picky in my old age, but nothing here stood out for me. Everything was ok, a couple of the things were pretty good, but for $40 in Vegas I want something amazing. Eh, but maybe I'm overshooting what's possible. Vegas is all style and no substance, and for me that is summed up pretty well with this buffet. 

My biggest complaint would be the service. We were almost done with our first plates of food when they finally brought us our drinks, and the dirty plates stayed on the table long after we had new ones. Seriously, a cheap-ass Chinese or Indian buffet for $9.99 has better service then this place. I guess that's why they make you pay first!

(seriously am just gonna save up and stay here next time). A buffet is the perfect option for a meal after a long night out. After comparing the breakfast and lunch prices on a weekday with other buffets (*cough* Bacchannal *cough*), I found The Buffet in The Wynn to be more reasonable. As much as I am a foodie, I didn't want to break the bank while enjoying myself in Vegas. 

I admit I felt a little overwhelmed as we wandered around looking around at the food selection. Imagine the Buzz Lightyear meme saying ""Food...food everywhere!"" I was definitely wondering where I should start my meal--cheese and crackers? Soup? Asian, New American, Italian, Mexican?!

For VEGETARIAN\/VEGAN eaters, there are plenty of dishes that will accommodate your palates. Most of the dishes are labeled with the full ingredients so you won't be caught off guard by anything. My friends enjoyed the polenta with roasted tomatoes, fire roasted veggies, vegan enchiladas, and beet salad. 

My favorite CARNIVORE\/OMNIVORE DISH was the fresh ceviche, tossed with a tangy chili sauce on a bed of salad greens. I seriously just took 2 or 3 mini bowls and dumped them into a large bowl (#noshame). The roasted brussels sprouts w\/ bacon were super delicious and I didn't expect to like brussels sprouts outside of Thanksgiving. There was also a large selection of roast pork, prime rib, flank steak, and other grilled meats. I also liked the fresh guacamole and smoky hummus with paprika...they paired well with the blue corn tortilla chips and pita chips.

For DESSERT, I enjoyed the mango sorbet and rum soaked pineapples. The vegan passion fruit tapioca was also a delicious option. 

Things to skip:
- Yogurt parfaits were out too long and the granola was a bit soggy
- Sushi and hand rolls were only so-so (definitely go for the ceviche instead)

Upon entering the buffet (and pretty much the hotel overall), I felt like we were transported to a scene from Alice in Wonderland. The walls were a lovely mint green and there were many flowers and other greenery around. I think the best word to describe the ATMOSPHERE is ""whimsy."" I half expected the Mad Hatter to pop up as we were enjoying our meal! There are also various elaborately decorated cakes in displays around the room (I would love to order one for my wedding if I ever get married!).

The SERVICE was a little bit slower due to the lunch rush of a Friday afternoon, but we eventually flagged down our waitress to load up on coffee (seriously needed caffeine ASAP), OJ, and water. I was surprised by the quality of freshly squeezed OJ and strong coffee! Soy milk is also an option as a sub for creamer.

This is a very diverse buffet that isn't too expensive in the Vegas area. The venue is great and I would highly recommend trying to make the latter end of breakfast time so you can enjoy both breakfast and lunch foods! (be sure to factor in cab and waiting in line times). Mmm...",6,3,3

After introducing herself, and asking us about our specific dietary restrictions, Kelly took us all around the buffet lines, alerting us what was vegan, and what special dishes they could prepare for us (options included pizza, ravioli, tofu scramble, pancakes, and more!) We opted to gorge ourselves on the buffets plentiful vegan offerings, plus a specially prepared Vegan ravioli. All was delicious and there was way more food than we could possibly eat, even desserts! I really enjoyed the ravioli, polenta, and buddha's delight veggies.

The service from the hostess to the servers was great. We opted for the bottomless drink addition and were never left feeling thirsty! They also had great coffee with Soy milk.

The buffet started at $35.99. I always order what I want and enjoy my meal thoroughly. However there was something special about the buffet at the Wynn.

They had over 8 different stations for different varieties of food. I started at the sushi station where I had a deal which is one of my favorite things. I was happy to see that the sushi chef there was very attentive to any rules or any particular item that wasn't on the menu that he could make for me. Impressive. I've been went to the carving station where I had prime rib that was juicy and flavorful even before I reach for the horseradish! They also had slab bacon in your choice of Apple or hickory smoke. I thought that was very interesting who would have thought you could have it homestyle. pier.

I enjoyed the pancake station were you had three varieties of pancakes to choose from - butter milk ,Blue corn and another variation that I cannot remember. But what I do remember best is the type of butter that I could choose. For my pancakes I had the apple butter with traditional whipped butter. It was so tasty.

The seafood station was very good from peel and eat shrimp to crab legs all of the seafood staples were near. You can never get enough fresh crab. I finish up my meal with a dessert from the dessert bar fresh gelato homemade cookies. It's enough to make you go mad. I greatly appreciated the pastry chef that was diligently making the sugary dessert as we ate.
My meal was accompanied by my endless mimosa which was an additional $15.

 What I was most impressed about this buffet, is that every station performed excellent presentation. The execution of all of the issues was well thought out and well planned. Everything was hot everything was fresh everything was in order. Everything you ate tasted like a $50 meal",0,1,0

I just stood there in awe at the massive amounts of food around me. If heaven had a buffet, this would be it. 

Fast forward roughly 6 years later, and I was hoping to experience a repeat of this little piece of heaven. I am happy to report that the buffet is still as good as the day the hotel opened!  The selection goes on for days, and the desserts are amazing. There's plenty of different food for everyone (even gluten free!). 

My only complaint occurred while I was in line. I was mentally prepared for the 45-minute wait, but what caught me off guard was the amount of cutting in the line. I hope that the casino takes better care to make sure that this is avoided. To give you an example, the 4 people in front of us, quickly grew to a party of 13!

The line was long, but we were seated within about 30 minutes. I was impressed with the selection of food, but not the overall taste. 

The main reason for my 2 star rating is the fact that I got violently ill at the restaurant about two hours after we started eating. I had to run to the bathroom twice before we left at 9:30pm. After that, I began having serious abdominal cramping which lasted all throughout the night, I couldn't even sleep. I lay on the bathroom floor until I started vomiting around 6am. I could not stop until 8am, which is when I went to seek medical attention. 

I did not have anything alcoholic to drink that day and had very plain food earlier that morning. I was the only one in my party to eat the lobster bisque and the shrimp salad -- which leads me to believe they may be the culprit. 

After calling the restaurant to file a claim--it was finally followed up on by customer claims. The woman who I spoke to assured me that it WAS NOT their food and that there was no way it was their food and they do not provide compensation for medical bills, or even the meal. My birthday was ruined and I was severely ill for 36 hours. The doctor thinks is was staphylococcal food poisoning, which is common from buffets where temperature regulation is extremely important. I wish they would've acknowledged that and perhaps simply compensated me for the meal. I spend $70 on the dinner and then an additional $180 in medical feeds.

I also went to Wicked Spoon and I actually prefer that over the Wynn buffet. This buffet is pretty legit and buffets in the bay CANNOT compare to the Vegas buffets whatsoever. 

I read reviews on how people got in a bit early and paid for the cheaper brunch buffet and then you get the best of both worlds because you get brunch and they slowly bring in the dinner food. However I didnt know about the timing and missed it by a few minutes. Brunch ends at 3pm and dinner starts at 3:30pm and I came right after 3pm. They close during that half hour so I couldnt pay the weekend brunch price of $31.99 but instead paid for the $39.99 dinner. That sorta sucked because I wanted to try their brunch food as well. There was already a line forming for dinner so we just went in line for that. 

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and so decorated. It is an explosion of color and flowers when you first enter and I prefer the ambiance here than at Wicked Spoon. It is way bigger and it looks like the food goes on forever and ever. I can go on about all the different foods there are but anything you can think of, they will have it. I had their prime rib and I thought it was pretty good. I am not much of a seafood person but to get the biggest bang for your buck, they have endless crab legs for you. I was more excited about the dessert selection because there were cookies, marshmallows, cakes, candied apples, macarons, tiramisu, and SOO MUCH MORE. I think the photos will give you a better idea of the ridiculous amount of choices you can get. The quality of food is awesome but I just found Wicked Spoon had the upper hand on the selection and quality.

The Buffet at the Wynn is different, because for $20 in Vegas, one salad pretty much makes the whole thing worth while.

I didn't go with just one salad though. I had quite the delicious sampling of tasty dishes. My favorites were the salads in the cute little glasses; the Thai Beef salad being my favorite. I also really enjoyed the duck salad, which was recommended by another Yelper. These salads don't just ""take up room in your stomach"", they are wonderfully seasoned and dressed perfectly.

When it comes to hot food, my favorite was the little tiny cornbread with hot pulled bbq pork and cole slaw on top. It was friggin' delicious. I also really enjoyed the gnocchi with peas. The peas were really fresh tasting, and not at all mushy.

The desserts here are crazy. It is not a ""station"" but indeed, an entire room. I had a tiny scoop of gelato with a really tasty wafer, and a little bit of the 8 or so desserts my boyfriend devoured. My favorite was the Bailey's Panna Cotta. Mmm!

For $20 in Las Vegas, you really can't beat this. Even if you don't have a big appetite, the buffet is worth it because you can get what ever you want for less that the price of any comparable restaurant in Las Vegas.

The best place to sit is in the beautiful atrium surrounded by the flower arrangments and it has so much natural light it will be sure to lift your moods if you just dropped the mortgage outside on the tables lol.",1,1,2

I came here on a Sunday night and did some major damage. This is easily the best buffet on the strip. The line up wasn't too bad at around 10 minutes, and the buffet definitely wasn't crowded. I did a walk-through at Wicked Spoon the next day, and I'm totally curious about the rave reviews for that buffet, the vast majority of dishes seemed totally bland with half the variety offered at Wynn. 

Wynn's Buffet caters very well to most common dietary restrictions (lots of diabetic, gluten-free and glycemic options). They have a mean couscous salad, an amazing green pea risotto and glazed pecan radicchio salad. 

The tomato gazpacho, though, entirely cute was slight little let down as an overly acidic base. They probably let it sit too long and the raw onion overpowered the ripe tomatos. 

Though I'm not a huge fan of crab legs, they always had a large amount available. They have a real tandoor, FTW and a creperie for dessert. In fact, I'd forego the other desserts for the crepes and fruit. 

I can't wait to be back.",3,1,2

We knew ahead of time, it would be expensive. It was like 40 a person for dinner. And we were prepared to pay.

The food was disgusting. We went on a Saturday night so it should have been busy enough for the food to rotate though. Everything I ate was dry and nasty. Like when you leave meat out for a few hours and the top of it crusts over. Or noodles that are half mushy half dried out hard. And the meats at the carving station was extra, extreme rare, borderline raw. 

I really thought there would be more selections. But in all seriousness, it's not at all bigger than your average neighborhood asian buffet. Except it's stretched out in a long line instead of cramped together. Because asian buffets do have american food and pasta and pizza. It's nasty, but it's the same nastiness of this buffet.

I thought the plates were beautiful. But I don't want to pay 40 dollars to eat on a nice plate.

On the upside, we recieved very good service.They were quick, and continually took our plates and refilled our drinks. We were however RIGHT next to their waiting station though. lol. The wait in line was pretty fast too. We probably waited less then 15 minutes. (On a busy night at HomeTown Buffet, (in the ghetto btw ;P  ) the wait time can be a freaking hour). 

Although our table wasn't that far, most of them were like a maze. I think I would definitely have gotten lost. However, like only a few feet from our table was a giant pile of dirty dishes, near the employee entrance. If I hadn't have been so obsessed with the disappointment of the food, I would have noticed that while I was there. Oh, but we have plenty of pictures with a huge stack of dirty dishes in the background.

I have to add that the line for crab legs is ridiculously long. It's a good 20 minutes in the line, but what makes it ridiculous is that the crab legs aren't worth it a bit. I got a plate full of it and ended up not eating any of them. I can't put my finger on it. It's too salty, but that's not the problem. I can' only relate it to having a metallic taste of it. I don't know what it is. But I couldn't eat it.

I don't know why everyone says it's so good. I am very picky. Or maybe I have better taste buds?",2,1,1

As with all buffets, some items were better than others. We met up with some friends so we had a group of 11, they automatically tack on 18% gratuity for that. Also if you have small kids with you, ages 3-8 pay half price. 

There was quite a selection of food: breads, (including gluten free if you ask), cold cuts, grains such as quinoa, carving station, Chinese food, to seafood and of course desserts. 
The carving station was very good, you have a choice or turkey, prime rib, sirloin (surprisingly it was bland for ""Chili rubbed sirloin""), and beef ribs. 
The Chinese section had dumplings, Peking duck in a bun (I got mostly bread with a tiny piece of duck in one, other was just duck skin, no meat!), 2 dishes, sweet and sour chicken and Mao pao tofu, steamed buns and shrimp dumplings, the food in this section was mediocre. 
Seafood section had crab legs (not sure what type not Alaskan though). It was very salty, I was not a big fan of it. Peeled shrimp, raw oysters, and cooked mussels. They also had various sushi and ahi tuna seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds, this was probably one of the better items at the buffet. Many pieces of the tuna had a tough difficult to chew tendon running through it. The ahi tuna and sushi are on small plates with 2-3 pieces on it. So if you want more, you have to walk several times, or some just took the sushi and dumped it onto a big plate and left a stack of small sushi plates at the buffet. 
Dessert seemed to have a good selection; there was ice cream, creme br√ªl√©e, crepe station, cheesecake and more. There were no macaroons! My son LOVES those and was disappointed. A server said they discontinued those about a year ago. Don't go by the pictures on Yelp.

Man.... talk about disappointment and I haven't been this disappointed since my 24 cents pay raise.

The short:

Good execution of common buffet items with sub par service.. 

Sorry, but if you're waiting in line for 20+ minutes for a $$$ buffet the last thing you want is a bitchy waitress.    

The guy who took my group's drink order was rarely seen. First round of water took almost 10 minutes. My lemonade refills were nonexistent, although he did grab our plates in a timely fashion. 

The food is what really confused me. The Wynn is perceived to be one of the nicest casinos in all of Las Vegas which would lead one to assume that spending $50+ (I had gratuity\/tax) you would get some premium items and feel upscale. Nope didn't get that feeling. Chicken noodle soup? Pizza? California rolls? Am I at the Wynn Buffet or Hometown buffet? 

Sure there were snow crab legs, prime rib, veal, dim sum, a pasta station, and a crepe station.. but come on, that isn't premium stuff. It isn't what one is to expect at a top tier casino like the Wynn.

(Factoring in that this is a buffet..)

What to get..

Prime rib- Ranges from 3-5 stars. If you get a good cut it's tender, juicy and delicious. If you get a bad cut it could be a bit dry but still alright. 

King Crab Legs- 5 stars. These king crab legs were probably the best ones I've had at a buffet. Very fresh, not too salty, not too cold. 

Veal Ribs- 5 stars- Probably my favorite thing at the buffet. Meat was fall off the bone tender. 

Indian Chicken- 4.5 stars- Delicious. Moist, tender and seasoned perfectly. 

Salmon- 4 stars. Pretty bomb, make sure to slather the sauce they provide for you. 

Smoked Salmon- 4.3 stars. It was really good smoked salmon...

Create your own pasta- 4 stars

Creme Brulee- 4 stars (Bellagio's is better). 

Fried Chicken- 4 stars. It was some dank ass fried chicken. Meat was really moist and tender inside, and the skin was perfectly crisp and seasoned well. 

Pineapples- 5 stars. Theses were the best pineapples I've ever had. Not just at buffets. 

Mediocre Stuff

Soup noodles- 3 stars. The broth is great but I wasn't a fan of the noodles. The beef and toppings were pretty decent as well. 

Risotto- 2-4 stars. The first time I got it, it was really good but the second time for some reason it tasted kinda weird. 

Pizza- 3.5 stars. It was not bad but not to die for either. 

Gelato- It was cool that there was gelato at a buffet, but I've had better gelato. 

Kobe Meatloaf- 3.5 stars- It was pretty decent but the sauce was a bit much. 

Shrimp Cocktail- 3.5- Decent, good size, but I feel like I've had fresher shrimp.

Turkey- 1.5 stars. Dry.",8,0,1

They had a house made strawberry port reduction jam that was heavenly. I normally am not a strawberry fan but wanted this on everything.

You should dress accordingly (Gentlemen: no sleeveless, Ladies: opaque coverups). It's worthwhile and #2 on the top 5 buffets in Vegas (from what I read)! Not the typical buffets you eat anywhere and probably the only buffet I like to eat at. 

There are a few things that are delicious and not so delicious, the dessert bar never fails me! Few notable items to eat at this buffet are the Alaskan crab legs (when it's available), Prime Rib, Venison, and Red Snapper w\/ Sweet Chile Cream Sauce. The sushis are okay but you should avoid them because you can eat better sushi elsewhere (Like at Makino). Most of the desserts are delicious! I mostly enjoy eating the vanilla bean gelato, chocolate\/peanut butter rectangle, and chocolate chip cookies. Mmm there's always room for dessert!

On the downside, it's quite a pricey place to eat at ($45 per person), the line could be long (about 20-45 minute wait, VIP line takes you straight to a table for $20 extra or something from what I remember), and the people don't refill your drinks very often. 

If you really want to have a good time at this buffet, take every item from the dessert bar and just try them all out (take a bite out of each)!

Seafood: shrimps with cocktail sauce were good, was told the crab legs were just ok.

Desserts: always delicious, carrot cake was good and a few others

Drinks: they have some healthy drinks on the far right of the buffet in the morning\/brunch hours which are good and the red alc drink, sorry forgot name and didn't take pic of name on all you can drink menu, is good but all depends on how sweet you like things

Chinese: all the ""dim sum"" is shrimp, didn't try the ""congee"" but not sure how you can mess that up. All the dimsum was good just too much shrimp and no other choices

Japanese\/Korean: they had a mix of japanese and Korean style sushi, really small rolls but still taste good.
I didn't try the pizzas because I wasn't trying to waste eating space.

Meats: the prime rib was ok, horseradish was good and spicy, the ribs were good the first night and mushy the second day. The cured pork was a bit salty. Bacon was good, not as crispy as I usually like but was not complaining. I didn't try the chicken but it looked good. They also had some other pork dish that was pretty dry and salty. They did have a sliced meats area with ""pickles"" aka conichon, and some olives where we're pretty yum. The salami was a little gamey and the marbled meats were a bit dry.

Breakfast: they had the usual, a couple of different egg benedicts, sausage, 2 styles of scrambled eggs(reg and white), corn beef hash(was just ok) waffles and three different styles of pancakes.

They had some other areas like meat and cheese with bread areas, fruits(if you don't see watermelon out of pineapple you can probably ask for some and they will cut you some), salads, soups, the normal stuff.

If you really want a buffet and you're near the Wynn, this might be worth a stop as long as the line is short (at or under 25 minutes). If the wait is more than 25 minutes, go somewhere else. If you are at the center or south end of the Strip, skip The Buffet entirely; it's not worth the long trek. 

THE WAIT: 
We arrived just past 7:00pm on a Monday evening and waited nearly *two hours* for a table. The length of the wait was irritating and the quality of the food did not make up for it.

THE PRICE: 
Dinner (as of 8\/2014) is $40 per person, fairly standard for a Vegas buffet. 

THE FOOD: 
On average, the food was good, not great and there is nothing I would go back for. 
Prime Rib - inconsistent:  some pieces were perfectly cooked, others (most of what I saw) was overcooked and looked tough
Crab Legs - watery, salty, mediocre
Mashed Potatoes - gummy texture, good flavor
Salads - generally good:  Caprese salad needed a hint more balsamic vinegar; Caesar salad bar was good; the others were forgettable 
Rigatoni with Mushrooms in Cream Sauce - good
Desserts - okay, nothing outstanding:  Cheesecake tasted like Jell-O instant cheesecake; Gelato was watery and disappointing; Creme Brulee was pretty good; Chocolate Covered Rice Krispie Treat was gross, chocolate coating tasted more like wax than chocolate

THE SERVICE:
Fine, nothing to write home about. The hostesses were friendly, but the service staff inside was fairly apathetic.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  
For a dining room this large, the noise level is fairly low. The decor is nice, but does not stand out from the rest of the casino.

OVERALL:  
At $40, I will gladly take my money to a sit down restaurant, where I'll get better food (in taste, preparation, and quality), better service, and likely a much shorter wait.",2,0,1

I ate so much I looked like a crab.  My waist line disappeared for a good two hours following my gluttonous feast.    Don't you dare judge me.  

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they are vegan friendly.  So friendly, that the chef came out and did a walk through with me to point out everything vegan.  I felt kinda special.  

I ate pretty much everything. The vegan pizza was addicting.  As was their tomato soup.  Their sushi rolls and kimchi was delicious!

Me:  ""We're in VEGAS.  We got OPTIONS!! If we eat here, it's one less KILLER place to eat at.""

Me:  WYNN BUFFET!  A co-worker told me it's hella good.  
Others: OK.....

Did I lead my people astray??? Hell naw!!  This place was the best 40 bones I spent last weekend in  Vegas.  Let me count the ways this place rocked: 

- asthetically, it's so put together you don't even feel like you are in a buffet
-STILL WARM pita bread readily available to spread on that oh-so-tasty humus.  Wynning combo!!! 
-very unbuffet-like prime rib....ohh gaaaaawd
-shelled shrimp  and Alaskan King Crab legs halved  so you can absolutely SHOVEL the meat on in your mouth.  
-the deserts....cheesecake? killer! Creme brulee....at a buffet?!?!  Are you serious?

We ate a bit early, around 5:30 on a Saturday evening.  There was no line and we were seated within 5 minutes. The price was $82 bucks with tax for 2 people.  I was expecting for this kind of money to get the best buffet food I've ever had in my life.  Unfortunately my expectations must have been too high.  

First of all, service!  We waited about 20 minutes before our server showed up to get our drink order.  This is unacceptable, especially during a time like this when the place was pretty slow.  Then, she never came back after she dropped the drinks off.  Our empty plates stayed on the table quite a while before they were picked up.

Secondly, food quality.  This place had the worst quality food I've had in my life.  EVERYTHING we had sucked.  I'm sorry, but dumping a bunch of salt on some overcooked asparagus does not make it better!   The pork tenderloin was dry and had way too much fennel seed on it!  The pizza was greasy and leathery.  

The sea bass was very boring, no flavor to it at all.  I had a couple of pastas, and they were all overcooked and lacking in flavor.  The mashed potatoes appear to be fake, but they were ok.  I had some wanton dumpling thing from the chinese area, and it tasted like a bad science project.   The rack of lamb tasted like ASS!  I was ready to leave after biting into it, but then I realized I still hadn't tried any desserts.

So, onto the good things... The fresh carved turkey was awesome!  The prime rib was delicious!  And the crab legs are gigantic, and easy to get lots of meat out of them so you don't have to work up an appetite trying to eat them.   That's about it... Turkey, crab legs, and prime rib.  If those 3 meats are your thing, you're gonna love this place, otherwise LOOK ELSEWHERE!

Desserts were all so-so.  They have fresh crepes made to order, but my local breakfast place that makes crepes does a much better job, so I didn't finish my crepe.  I had some coffee ice cream with oreo cookie on top.  The ice cream was all coffee bean and no cream!  ICK!   The carrot cake was pretty good.

Overall, this place has only a few things you will enjoy, the rest will make some starving country in Africa pissed off that you wasted your food!!  I would say you really should go elsewhere for a good buffet, the Rio's buffet is much better and a bit cheaper... But it's not my favorite either.

Maybe my food tastes are getting too discriminating, but for $37 bucks I think I'd rather go to a nice sit down restaurant on the strip rather then eat food for the masses!",3,2,0

I have been to a lot of buffets on the strip but the quality of this buffet is top notch. The selection is amazing and it's great for all meals. Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. 

The seafood is probably what gets most people coming back for more with tons of crab legs and shrimp. And I don't even like crab legs but when we see people stacking crab legs it must be good. I stock up in the shrimp for sure. 

But the selection is again amazing. Italian, American, Asian, and even sushi. Good buffet sushi is hard to find. And there is so much more. The mashed potatoes alone can have their own septet ate review of awesomeness. 

The dessert. OMG. BEST THING EVER! 

I will admit it is a bit pricey. Heck I recommend come for breakfast eat light wait for them to roll out lunch and save a few bucks. But it is totally worth the money and also the drive. (If your not on this side of the strip)

I found it very refreshing that instead of making a big tray of food and allowing it to sit there for a while, there were medium to small sized plates of each item and there was a chef at each station (ie Chinese, Mexican)  to replenish each whenever the supply ran low. This allowed for the food to be freshly prepared and certain food items did not sit there and dry out.

The desserts were plentiful, with many varieties so I was glad to see that for a change. I am not usually one for sweets but I did try some mousse and enjoyed it.

For me this was the best one in terms of food quality and flavor. There was an ample selection of items and more than you could try even with a large appetite. We paid the extra 10 bucks a head to get into the express line which is also where the rewards program participants line up. It still took about 20 minutes but was well worth it unless you like waiting 90 minutes to save a few bucks. The service here was the best out of any of the buffets we tried. We were here for lunch so the seafood and fish selection was very limited. But the items they did have were all very good, The mussels, tuna poke, shrimp dumplings, roasted salmon, cod and snapper were all very good. The sushi selection was just a few selections and very basic. That was a disappointment. 

The carved meat table was nice and had 5 selections as I recall. The roasted tri-tip was very good as was the mashed potatos and gravy. The mashed were like silk and with that gravy it was top notch. The roasted veggies were very good as was the green beans and broccoli as they were well seasoned with something besides sat. Then there was the latkes. These are potato pancakes made with a shredded potato like hashbrowns instead of a grated type as most other types. These were cooked on a road flat top grill and topped with a variety of toppings. I had the shredded Kobe beefs hitch was excellent as was the Ruben version which had the same toppings as the sandwich would. There were several other versions available but I was getting full.

Atmosphere:
The buffet is not huge but it consists of all regular Vegas buffet menu.  I enjoyed the relaxing environment even the long line is consistent at the cashier.  There is no rush or eager to get your piece of meat or seafood.

Pros:
Dinner (only naming the noteworthy here):  
The lamb curry and lamb steak are both tasty.
The cha sui (BBQ pork) is juicy and almost authentic.
The ordinary chicken noodle soup is made with care.  The broth is clear and not oily.  I can taste the chicken and eat all the ingredients.  Normally, I will only drink some of the soup and discard all the mushy or tasteless ingredients.
$19 Endless Pours is a good deal IMO.

Pros:
-Breakfast (only naming the noteworthy here):
-Egg station has a long line as usual at all breakfast\/brunch places.  The cook makes a perfect fried egg with tall egg white around.  It is worth the wait.
-Thick ham slice with Dijon mustard is a perfect marriage.  It was not too salty and it is moist at the same time.
-Kudos to Wynn's No Sugar Added Dessert Station at all meals.  These desserts are so yummy without the added sugar.  It is naturally good.

Cons:
-Dinner:  The crepes station staff was not too friendly.  The crepes filling is too cold to pair and to eat with the hot crepes.  That was a waste of food and time.
-Dinner:  
-Breakfast & Dinner:  The salad station is on the weaker side.  The fruit selections are very lacking but all things taste good here.
-Dinner:  Lobster Bisque tasted fishy; not good eat.
-Breakfast:  Chinese Congee is available at a serving station.  The congee base is good, authentic and plain (on purpose).  Upon request, the server will put together a bowl for your liking.  However, congee and the sides combination is a very personal thing.  I find it difficult to ask what and how I like to put the congee together.  So, it is best to make this a self-serve station IMO.  Good attempt.
-Breakfast:  The two pancakes we ordered to cook at the rotation grill are uncooked on the inside.  That was a waste of time.
Note:  Congee condiment includes century eggs, Chinese pickle, cilantro, green onion, fried onion, Chinese donut pieces, etc.

Service rating is difficult to rate in Vegas.  It depends on the time and week of the day, and how busy.  (In theory, it should be consistent but in reality is rare.)

My boyfriend loved the tuna poke and we both really liked the lobster pot pie. Dessert also had some highlights, like mini tres leches cake and the peanut butter bar.

A big downside was the oyster selection. My boyfriend got 4 raw oysters, and 2 were bad. One was covered in sand and one was just plain rotten. He was too wary to go back for more.

This place is amazing for a few reasons; the attention to detail, the overall classiness, and the food are all superb.  

I noticed the buffet had food from different corners of the world.  The interesting part is that all the chefs looked the part.  Meaning there was an Asian guy cooking the Asian food and a big Texas looking guy cutting the ribs, etc.  I'm not sure if that was pure coincidence, but it was impressive to me nonetheless.

This was my 2nd dinner at Wynn Buffet and second disappointed. Currently Wynn Buffet offers worst value in Las Vegas. Most of the food they have is great except for crab legs which were small and dry, though there may be some dry spell on those because Planet Hollywood had the same problem with crab legs recently. However, the main issue is simply lack of food selection. No ribs, no roast, no brisket, no mushrooms, no fruit, and no many other things that I enjoy at other local buffets, not even strawberries that other reviewers mentioned. I could get filled up with mashed potatoes and prime rib, but that's not why I'm paying $35 for a buffet. My family also couldn't find much to eat, which was a huge letdown. We all much prefer Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, Green Valley Buffet, and others at lower prices.

BTW, people serving Caesar salad at Wynn look just ridiculous. I saw two customers  trying to explain how much salad they want to squeeze on their already half-filled plates, and going back and forth ""little less"", ""little more"", instead of getting themselves as much salad as they want. Come on, is this place so snobby that patrons wouldn't know how to handle their own salad? This might be great bit for a next comedy blockbuster though.",7,5,4

They had a huge selection of food and the quality of each item they had was excellent.  It was the first time where I sat down at a buffet and ate as if I was eating a 5 course meal.  We started with appetizer, soup, salad, and moved on to main course, and dessert.  There was so much stuff there, that we don't think we were even able to taste them all.  My wife really loved it, and it takes a lot to impress my wife with food.

Atmosphere was good and service was good as well.  We did have to wait about 30-40 minutes (I'm sure this wasn't that long) before being seated, but it was worth it.  It is expensive for a buffet, but it was worth every penny.  

The Wynn itself was amazing.. they had this display of a lit waterfall reflecting over a pool.  It made people just stop and stare in awe.  The whole place was like that.. We didn't spend enough time at their casino nor their resort\/hotel to write a review, but I'm sure one day we will.",0,0,0

5th of 5. Last one. And the best one.

Can anyone say crabs? Forgo all the other food until you've had a plate of crab legs. Really, this is simple work to eat, Wynn splits the legs in half for you, so all you have to do is pull out the meat and dip it in their butter sauce. Amazing! I ate 3 plates full of crab legs until i couldn't stand it anymore.

Then I switched gears and tried the prime rib. I had forgotten how good the Wynn makes their prime rib. It nearly melts in your mouth and tastes very buttery. 10\/10 for taste here. You can't get it better. Really!

Dessert great lineup of choices. They not only looked good, but tasted good. They have crem brule here. They do a good job with it as well. They also serve gelato.

Do not even bother with the candy apple either, unless you A. want to have an emergency dentist visit or B. do not care about your 2 front teeth.  That outer coating is hard as a rock.

I also had the buffet at the Bellagio about a month before this, so that's what guides the comparisons I'm making here.

I'd go so far as to say it's impossible to write a review of this buffet without placing it in the context of the Bellagio. Both hotels are near the top of the Vegas hotel and food experience, they're near comparable in terms of pricing, and they both bear the heavy hand of Wynn himself. 

I'll come right out and say it: I think the Wynn's buffet is just a bit better than the Bellagio's. Don't kick yourself if you go to one over the other though -- the difference is noticeable, but not vast, and both of them offer a fun and tasty experience. Overall, I found the Wynn had higher quality food -- fresher, slightly better prepared, and even winning a bit on presentation. The Bellagio did have a wider variety of food, but at times it felt a little mass produced, and some things weren't just served the way they should be (shrimp cocktail a bit too cold, eggs a bit too tepid, that kind of thing). Other things were exactly similar -- they both served the same Freixenet champagne, they both featured gloriously patches of natural light interspersed with more conventional booths and tables, and they both seemed to have comparable attention to service. 

Here's what I liked about the Wynn:

* The desserts [which were clearly superior to the Bellagio's] were awesome. Superb ice cream, yummy apple pie bits, tasty cookies, and wild candied apples -- this is to say nothing of the buttery croissants near the dessert. :)

* The drinks -- the same all you can drink champagne on Sunday mornings that you can get at most places, and then 'bottomless' version of the same for a modest fee in the evenings [$7 for all-you-can-drink Kettel One Bloody Mary's here). Service on these was great -- I never found myself wanting for alcohol. :)

* The bacon was just the right amount of crispy. It's a hard thing to cook bacon for a mass of people without making the bacon either too soggy or too burnt, but they nailed it.

* Solid breakfast: Good french toast, good eggs benedict, tasty waffles. They just got it all right, and generally you miss on at least one dish at breakfast.

* THE KING CRAB. I saved the best for last. Because, honestly, Jesus Christ, the crab was the best crab I'd ever put in my mouth at a buffet. Pre-cracked (brilliant), served with surely-bad-for-you-but-oh-so-good butter, and I went through three plates of it at dinner. 

Ok, now I've poured out my heart about the crab, here's what I didn't like about the buffet:

* The Line

I know that when you give Americans (or people visiting in America and wanting to cosplay our life of reckless excess) an all-you-can-eat pass, they show up in droves. But I have to think, in my heart of hearts, that you can do better than making me stand in line for 45 minutes on a Sunday night to get in to eat. It's also galling to me when I'm staying in the prole-ish rooms at the Wynn that I get to see the beautiful people from the tower suites waltzing ahead of me over in the VIP line.  Crab envy gave me class envy.

* The crab only comes out at 3:30 pm. 

The crab would make a perfect breakfast or lunch food, but it's only brought out for dinner.  There are all sorts of plans where you buy lunch at 3:15, then wait for the crab to show up, but honestly I would rather be able to pay a little extra in the morning to get access to that sweet, sweet crab.

* A little over the top in the exotic department.

Even in the dessert section, which I regarded as stand-out, this showed up. While the stuff there was amazing, I ended up missing some of the more basic desserts that I come to expect -- cheesecake, chocolate, German chocolate, coconut cake, or even some eclairs (which my gf couldn't find).

*

I would happily go again -- and if they fixed any one of my complaints, I'd give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.",1,2,1

The Wynn is as good as it gets when it comes to dinner buffets on the strip. The only worthy competing buffet is the pricey Sterling Brunch and the Seafood Buffet at The M Resort. The Bellagio disappointed me. 

This review is really long, so I had to write it as 2 reviews due to the character limitations of Yelp.

@ Alaskan King Crab - Bottom line, you come to the buffet for these crab legs. Otherwise, save your money and go to another buffet. The crab legs is what really sets apart the Wynn and the other buffets. These crabs legs are much bigger and sweeter than the ones at Bellagio. Unlike the Paris Buffet, the Wynn (and Bellagio) split the crab legs in half, making it very easy to eat. I recommend using chop sticks to eat it since its cleaner than using your hands and doesn't damage the meat like a fork.

@ Prime Rib - A meat that you certainly will see at every buffet. This is usually a mix bag. The good thing however is the Wynn now seems to be offering meat that standing in a pool of blood to meat that is burnt to a crisp. On the couple of visits prior, they only had one or the other. Disappointing for those who like their meat rare or those who like their meat well done. Don't bother telling the carvers what temperature meat you want, they'll just smile at you and just give you whatever. Just be a mountain, look at the meat you want, stare at it, and attack it or you can ask the carver nicely to cut you that piece of meat for you.

@ Shrimp Cocktail - The times I've been here, the shrimp cocktail seem to vary from really good and sweet to not that tasting that good. I would say the shrimp cocktail tends to be good more times than bad.

@ Rack of Lamb - This was so much fail. First round, I got lamb that is so dry that the only way to get it this way was to salt it, burn it to a crisp, cover it in sand to absorb all the moisture, and take a flamethrower to burn it to a crisp again and put it on my plate. Round 2 was just as bad, except in the other end of the spectrum. The meat wasn't even cooked on the outside, it wasn't super rare, it was raw. After these 2 rounds of fail, I just gave up on this item.

@ Sushi - This is a tough one. I'm trying to decide which place has the worst sushi, Wynn or Bellagio. I would say the Wynn is slightly better than the monstrosity at the Bellagio. At least the consistency of the filling inside is edible and not disgusting. Go to the M Resort if you want decent sushi for a buffet. 

@ Pot Stickers - Eureka! I found an alternative to cough medicine. Oh wait never mind, it doesn't cure coughs. But it still taste really bad! Wahoooo!

@ Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) - This wasn't all too bad. It was decent and by far better than places like Orchid or Ichiza. It was at least  warm and didn't fall apart when you grab it. However, the quality of shrimp could have been better.

@ Shrimp Shumai - Ahh yes, I remember that I'm in Vegas, so you won't find any good dim sum here and this is no exception. Like the har gow, quality of shrimp was lacking. The skin made this item look less appetizing. 

@ Korean BBQ - This won't win any awards, but it was satisfactory. Meat was tender and the sauce didn't overpower the meat.

@ Mini Baguette - The bread wasn't fresh the least bit. Its not like the baguette you get from a bakery that just came out the oven.

@ Pumpernickel Bread - After having a similar bread at Cheesecake Factory, I have fond memories of this bread. Alone this bread tastes just okay, but get the drawn butter that you use for crab legs and dip your pumpernickel bread in there. You'll feel like your in bread heaven with each bite. 

@ Lamb Chop -  The beginning of a lot of dry and overcooked meat. Pass.

@ Veal - A really gamey tasting meat, that was dry. Pass.

@ Red Snapper - Out of the 3 fishes I tried, this is my favorite. It was cooked just right. All the juices of the fish was still preserved, so sauce wasn't necessary. 

@ Sea Bass - One of my favorite fishes that was dissapointing to eat. It was just way too overcooked and was very dry. Pass.

@ Crusted Salmon - Salmon is one of my least favorite fishes. However, this was cooked almost perfectly. Just a little tad bit too much, but still good. 

@ Mussels - One of the dishes that I like, that I can't remember the sauce. I would say these are steam mussels in a light cream and butter sauce. Very delicious with the sauce.

@ Mashed Potatoes - I love mashed potatoes and always have to try it wherever I go. The mashed potatoes here was awesome. A perfect creamy, yet some firmness. Perfect consistency and most importantly tastes good as well.

@ Chocolate Orange Marmalade Cake - This dessert was very good, except for the orange layer in the middle that was sandwiched between the chocolate. Biting into the orange layer just ruined this cake for me. If it wasn't for the orange, this dessert would have been perfect.",4,3,2

Most definitely, the Wynn does the job when it comes to making every food into a gourmet dish that could have easily been served as an entree (or an appetizer).  Case in point was the gazpacho.  I don't think we've ever had an a la carte gazpacho that tasted so good.  We could taste the ground apples and other ingredients - it was so fresh.

The shrimp cocktail (for those fellow shrimp fans) were jumbo and, ginormous.  The King Crab legs were fairly decent, but not over-the-top astounding.  The seafood selection was definitely decent.  

However, the draw to the Wynn is not the untouched foods such as the crab legs or the salmon, but that which takes effort to create (e.g., some of the pasta, the soups, and I have never seen pizza at a buffet look so delectable).

The reason I did not give this five stars, however, was because I still prefer the Bellagio buffet, despite the Wynn's impressive high-end ambience and food preparation.  I believe the Bellagio does it best when it comes to the raw ingredient quality - from the variety of king to dungeness crab, to the Scottish salmon.",2,0,3

Lesson #1: Don't come here if you're starving.  Come here if you're hungry.  I ate to the point where I started to feel really sick.
Lesson #2: No buffets within 3-4 hours of drinking\/clubbing.  No one wants to feel like a whale in their skimpy Vegas outfit.

As for the buffet, the food was ok.  It was a solid buffet, but only a few things stood out to me (even when I was starving!)  They have your usual fish, meats, and seafood but I actually really enjoyed the simple things like the baby back ribs and the broccoli cheese soup.  The sushi was bleh, no thanks.  I loved the herb salmon and the desserts!  The coffee ice cream was one of the best I've ever tried.  Here's an idea.  Grab 2 cookies and make an ice cream sandwich with the ice cream, sooooo good!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, ""What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???""

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95\/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: ""Where do you live?"" ""Where's your family?"" ""How long have you been here?"" ""Can you take our picture?"" ""Can you take one more?"" ""Okay, one more picture?"" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

My friends and I decided to try out the Wynn buffet for brunch during our most recent Vegas trip. We made it right at the end of the Brunch and the beginning of Dinner. The lady at the cash register hooked it up and let us pay brunch prices when it was technically already dinner. I'm thinking it was because we got the ""Auntie"" hookup, but whatever I'll take it!! 

They had a huge selection and everything was good from what I can remember, but honestly my mind is clouded by thoughts of those Alaskan king crab legs. My friend and I just happened to be in the area when they first started putting the crab legs out for dinner and we were the first people in line! I was amazed at the size of these things ... they were huge!!! The best part about them was that they were already cut in half for you to eat. All you had to do was pull the thick succulent meat out, dip it in the warm butter, and pop that deliciousness in your mouth! Damn it was so good. For 2 straight hours we were neglecting whatever else they had to offer in that buffet and focused primarily on the CRAB LEGS!! We had plates and plates and plates full of those things and we just kept them coming. 

We might have been a group of little Asian girls, but we tore up those crab legs like 200 pound men! Our waitress was even impressed at how many plates of crab legs we finished off.

Ahhhh.... I will return!",4,3,3

I haven't done the whole Vegas buffet thing, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I keep hearing that the Wynn Buffet is the best. If this is the best, I'm afraid of what else is out there. The food was ok but not that good, and definitely not amazing. I did go to the lunch so there were no crab legs, etc., so maybe dinner is a whole other story. Maybe. But I think large buffets just tend to skimp a little on quality in favor of quantity regardless of when you eat.

If I hadn't won 2 free buffets I don't think I would have been happy paying the $22 + tax per person for lunch. What does make it worthwhile (if you love desserts) is the variety of good dessert selections.  Additionally, beverages are included, and if you get there early enough they will have fresh squeezed orange juice.

The Wynn buffet is probably the largest I've been too, but after circling the buffet twice, I only found a handful of items that looked appetizing enough to put on my plate. Of the things I ate:

DECENT: Manhattan clam chowder, squid ceviche, mashed potatoes, grilled corn, salads, fresh fruit

JUST OK: BBQ ribs, fried chicken--a little too sweet, cha siu bao (chinese pork buns), shu mai (dumplings)

BAD: pasta--white sauce & cheesy kinds, white rice from the asian section

As for desserts, they all looked good. There are no dessert tasting restaurants where I live, so I love having the opportunity to try different sweets in one sitting. Overall, the desserts did not disappoint. 

BEST: caramel eclair

GOOD: cheesecake, banana chocolate cake, madeleine

OK: ice cream--a little eggy, carrot cake

BAD: mini cupcakes--oily, not very flavorful, too much frosting

Even though I enjoyed the desserts I don't think I'll be returning to the buffet. I think I would rather pay a little more and go to a restaurant where I know I'll get a good meal.

And food is right at the top of that list of excessive activities.  I usually hit up the Bellagio, but yearning something new, the gals and I tried the Wynn's house of gluttony. 

I was not disappointed.  Before I get to the food, let me just get a little Victoria Beckham in this review and say that the decor in this joint was just god-awful.  I don't know who the interior decorator was, but the place looks like all 4 of the Golden Girls vomited (Betty White on SNL!!!) and that crusted vomit was used for decor while poor women dressed in hot pink skirt suits walked around wondering why it is that the otherwise classy Wynn Casino would subject them to the horror of wearing hot pink.

As for the food, it's a buffet.  So the sure thing is that there is going to be a lot of food.  But it's not a sure thing to get good food.  To maximize the returns on my investment ($31.99 + tax on weekends), I headed straight to the expensive stuff--shrimp, prime rib etc.  The food was great.  Prime rib was juicy to the point that it effectively bled all over my plate.  Other items were also flavorful.  

After the savory portion of my meal, I headed over to the dessert spread.  I took one look, and I swear I became instantaneously diabetic.  I had some fresh ice cream, profiteroles, and cookies.  In other words, I was a fat ass, and I was happy.

Most buffets in Vegas also feel overcrowded and the interior of the restaurant isn't very nice, but the Wynn buffet is really pretty inside.

The prices are a little higher than most but definitely worth the money.  I usually go for brunch and I would recommend going on the earlier side to get the breakfast price which is cheaper than the lunch price.  Otherwise I would go on the later side for lunch because they only bring out the crab legs at 3pm.

They had fruit, cheese, fresh baked pastries, shakes, eggs in every which way you could think of, gourmet even, lemon and ricotta cheese blintzes, all the breakfast meats of course, amazing corned beef hash, omelette station, pancake bar, fresh seafoods, shrimp, mussels, oysters, carving stations for prime rib, beef ribs, turkey, pork loin, shrimp egg rolls, pork and shrimp shu mai, seaweed salad, and of course lets not forget desserts! So many desserts all being made fresh in front of you! I know i missed so many things, all the more reason for you to make a visit if you are ever in the city of sin...ful indulging! Their red velvet pancakes made to order with chocolate chips. You must order at least three please. 

Although some of these items may sound like normal buffet items, its the presentation and flavor that speak for themselves. Everything was so well put together and some items just oh so cute! I did my best to try everything, as awful and gluttonous as that sounds, it's the truth! The only thing I wish our meal came with was exit by wheel chair! 

A truly wonderful experience to be had from the second you walk in to the moment you realize you are done. The service we had was also great, I should mention that. Our waiter and busser were very tentative and were also only all to happy to take our group photo as well. If you need a place to take someone special while in Vegas, I know you have many options but I think this one should at least make the list of choices. You won't disappoint, I promise!",3,0,0

Went for Sunday brunch @ $32 per person. Dining room decor was pretty plain for a Wynn property. I checked out each food station briefly before digging in. Several salads being served, well someone gives you lettuce then you finish it up. Meats and cheeses. A couple of Asian dishes, a couple of Mexican dishes, omelet station, scrambled eggs(kinda dry and overcooked), bacon (very good), sausage (pretty damn salty, prime rib (no bones tho), corn flake fried chicken, mashed potatoes, sushi, chilled shrimp. Just pretty basic fare. No BBQ, no crab legs, not a big selection for the price. Too bad LV Hilton is gone, loved their brunch! M is much better! Service was a little slow but the red sangria was top notch! $30 for a pitcher. Maybe the dinner during the week is better. I will not be doing brunch here again.

There was a severely handicapped man by himself at the buffet. I believe he had cerebral palsy as he did not have very good use of his body and had very jerky arm movements. He also could not speak very well and his words were pretty slurred and hard to make out.  He had a very nice server help him fill his plate because he was unable to do so alone. 

He then sat and ate his food alone.  He made quite a mess on the floor, his face, and his shirt, but seemed to be enjoying his food.  He then tried to ask another server to get him something.  She tried so hard but could not understand him.  She got another server to try.  She also could not understand.  They tried a manager who also couldn't tell what the man wanted.  The gentleman was becoming very agitated and upset.  I felt awful, as did all the people trying to help him. 

Finally a member of management, named Elaina, showed up.  She was able to understand him because he was speaking spanish!  She was able to determine that he wanted dessert!   Of course....who wouldnt?! 

The man got his dessert but Elaina didn't stop there.  She sat with this man for the next 30 minutes.  Talking to him, laughing with him, helping him wipe his face and shirt.  The man was smiling from ear to ear.  I sat at my table and cried real tears over the kindness Elaina showed this man in need.

The price was $37.99 per person, and the wait was more than an hour.  When I got to the pay station, I was jumping for joy because I was so close to the food.  I was quite entertaining for the cashiers.

That aside, I gave the buffet a 4-star rating for its variety and quality of ingredients used.  The buffet have various stations such as Salad station, Asian station, Italian station, meat and dessert stations.  I did not try any of the dumplings or dim sum in the Asian station, as we have plenty of good authentic Asian foods in the bay area and I am sure the ones at the buffet wouldn't wow me that much.  

I enjoyed the cervices, Italian pastas, lamb shanks, prime rib, and KING CRAB LEGS!!!  All were extremely fresh and tasty.  I have to mention that they seem to use very good quality ingredients, for example the mushrooms in the herb-crusted salmon are fresh and flavorful, onions used in the italian sausage dish was sweet and cooked to perfection, and cherry tomatoes used in salads were also sweet and delectable.

For soups, they had clam chowder, corn chowder, chicken noodle and tom yum soups.  The tom yum soup lacked lemon grass flavors.  My Thai friends would surely be disappointed.  But having had so much good Asian foods in the bay area, I guess my standard of quality for Asian foods in the buffet is much higher than an average buffet goer in Vegas.

For dessert my friend ordered a crepe from the Dessert station, but they didn't fold it!  She mentioned that she had tasted better in SF anyways so I didn't bother.  The creme brulee was fairly good, and I also had some ice cream with oreo cookies.  For some reason the servers at the dessert station were very grumpy that night; they ignored me for a long time when I was waiting to be served ice-cream, and they were also impatient with my friends.

They have a pasta station during dinner where one of the cooks will make you a pasta dish with whatever ingredients you want! Unfortunately, I was so stuffed, and was trying to save whatever space I had left for their deserts. I definitely agree with Christina C., there creme brulee was awesome and worth that extra space!

I have to admit, the buffet is very expensive especially when your taste buds are lost after gorging down all that much food.

So let's talk about the Wynn. When you walk into a place that looks like something Master P would find a bit ""over the top""... you can't expect the price for the buffet to be the same as Circus Circus. The dinner buffet is going to cost you about $40 bucks, without tip. I actually expected it to be more. The menu items tell you right away where the money goes. Prime rib, game hen, quail, corn flake fried chicken, seafood, pasta... and the list goes on and on. They have Asian, American, Italian food and I'm probably missing a few with that list. Also, I'm not a dessert person, but they have one of the better cheese cakes I've ever tasted. I would also give an honorable mention to the carrot cake. 

I'm not the kind of person who goes out for an evening and eats quail or game hen. So the Buffet at the Wynn was a new experience for me. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service, the food and the attention to detail. It lived up to it's reputation as the best Buffet in Las Vegas.",1,0,1

They have everything that I love to sample, and everything that I love to indulge on.  I have been here a few times and I am never disappointed.  This is my buffet of choice whenever I am in town.

My first visit I came here for dinner with my boss, yes it's a little pricey, but totally worth it.  My favorite item that visit was the creamed button mushrooms.  OMG these were awesome!!  Sadly I have returned and have not seen them since.

My second visit here I brought my friend that lives in Vegas.  Can you believe that, me bringing her!  Most locals don't venture out onto the strip very often, which is a shame, they miss out on some pretty good eats that way.  We were here forever!  We stayed so long that when we got up to cruise the buffet again the waitress told us ""Thank you, have a good evening""  We both laughed and told her that we weren't leaving yet and we would be right back.  

I came again on my b-day weekend.  Yes, the whole weekend was devoted to me, not just one day!  Of course I chose this buffet to come to since this trip was all about me.  One of my friends didn't think it was worth the price, but I think that's because she doesn't have good taste like me.  To her the best buffet is at the Rio, which to me that is like eating at Home Town Buffet.  Oh well, I got my way, so there!  

We piled our plates up with king crab legs and shrimp, and made to order pastas.  The desert bar is the best in any buffet that I have been to.  They have handmade ice creams, which are super yummy, especially the coconut flavor.  Creme brulees, which are my fav, I can sit there and just eat that the whole time I'm there if you let me.  Candy apples, crepes, cookies, cakes, tarts, all super delicious.

If you don't mind spending a little more and getting great food, this is a definite stop while in Vegas.  You won't be disappointed!",1,0,0

1 Star for Service

On the pricy end of Vegas buffets, but you do get a vast selection of choices including king crab legs and prime rib. However, it doesn't get 5 stars like I would happily rate Wicked Spoon inside the Cosmo.

The wait:
- around 40ish minutes at any given time throughout the dinner period
- i went on a monday night around 9pm and it was definitely busy
- it was around 40 min wait for a party of 2

The service:
- my server was fairly...indifferent
- he wasn't cheery, nor a downer...he just kind of did what he was supposed to do, minus he didn't offer to refill our drinks. so we had to ask and only got refilled once
- they weren't the quickest to clean up our plates, even though the boyfie and i politely always stack our plates so they're easy to grab

The food:
- granted...I wasn't sober at the time of my visit, but it wasn't anything that deserves at 5
- yes, they do have king crab legs (and though I'm not a big seafooder) I do see the value of this commodity; however, the line to get some is long and they're not the fastest at refilling the loot
- if you really want to get some good stuff, to the left of the king crab legs they have smoked salmon sashimi. dasswassup
-  the prime rib is standard, but not mouth watering or melt in you mouth status, also considering it was near closing...it didn't look fresh
- the rest is faiiiirly standard for a vegas buffet (ok desserts, really dry sushi, decent but not spectacular pasta)

Sadly it was subpar and disappointing.  The floral arrangements that decorate the entrance are stunning, the food however is not.  Looking more closely it is odd that this buffet has 273 reviews not recommended on Yelp that are ""hidden"" aka they are unflattering.  There is one star after one star!  

The line was about 30 minutes but once inside there seemed to be plenty of empty tables.  I think they are keeping a line outside as a gimmick to hype the place up.  

The cost was very high for what you get.  The service was lacking, took a long time for a glass of water.  The selection here was vastly underwhelming.  There was no stand out dish just a sea of average or below.  It wasn't on par with the price tag or ambiance.  It honestly is mall food court food.  The desserts were beautiful, but taste wise just okay.  The creme br√ªl√©e was undercooked and the pannacotta's texture was way off.  The dumplings were made with a low grade of meat.  The homemade chicken soup tasted like Progresso.  The seafood selection was weak, and lower cost fish used in most dishes.  Souplantation has better food for 1\/3 the price.

Also, for a buffet that cost around $40 per person I would have expected more seafood, honestly, but it was pretty much just crab and some overcooked fish... 

The only redeeming part of dinner was the dessert. I sampled the dulce de leche, creme brulee, chocolate with orange marmalade, raspberry cake, raspberry cheesecake, and lemon meringue (or something like that). I liked the creme brulee quite a bit and the dulce de leche was also good. Just the right amount of sweetness.

But at the end of the day I found myself completely stuffed but not satisfied with the food and wondering why I did this to myself. A sad day indeed.",1,0,0

Came here for BREAKFAST on our last day in Vegas and it was amazing. $21 per person is a great price. Their food selection was very impressive for breakfast. So many different kinds of parfaits, egg dishes, pancake station, fresh fruits, cereal station, the best California rolls, variety of meats, and they serve crab legs and the most succulent shrimp cocktail for breakfast OMG!

-smoked salmon
-banana and nutella parfait

Dinner: 
high quality: Alaska King Crab, prime pib, sea bass, jumbo shrimp cocktail, grilled asparagus(tasty seasoning), leafy salads.

interesting entrees: smoked duck salad, 5 different kinds of ceviche (which I didn't find them authentic but worth trying).

other entrees I didn't try but looked delicious: smoked salmon salad, pasta, smoke salmon, veal.

Portion size was small, so I could sample more of the other entrees.

The only entrees I didn't like were the crispy red snapper and braised short ribs, very dry. I also didn't try their soup since the choices were nothing special, clam chowder, chicken noodle soup, french onion, and some veg. soup.

Dessert:
Not a lot of choices, not impressed with the choices.
Their coffee sorbet and strawberry shortcake were excellent though.  
Creme brulee was runny and was available only every 20 mins. or so.
Strawberry mousse was mediocre.
The staff at the counter was so busy scooping the ice cream, there's nobody available to cut the candied apple for us.

The servers were v. efficient and courteous. Their regular coffee was quite good.

Price: B+
The price per person on a Saturday was about $40. Not bad considering the caliber of hotel and ambiance setting. Good brunches can be very expensive, but this was surprisingly affordable.

Customer Service: A
The servers taking drink orders and busing our tables were very quick and checked up periodically. It is a buffet, so customer service is pretty short and less formal than your normal sitdown place, so for that I give it an A. The line getting into the buffet is another story, but I won't ding them for that 45 minute wait.

Quality: C
Here's where The Buffet fell short of 4-5 stars. PROS: LOTS of choices at brunch. From granola, yogurt, fruit, waffles, bacon, sausage, crab cake eggs benedict, made to order pancakes & omelets, dim sum, shrimp, oysters, crepes, macarons, gelato, panna cotta, pastries. CONS: all the choices listed above seemed pretty average for the caliber of hotel. 
I did not list the meat carving station as a PRO because it fell short of my expectations. The prime rib was dry and overcooked. There was lamb, turkey, and chicken but none of them looked appealing (again dry looking and overcooked). I expected more from The Buffet as far as quality of the food, but it was alright at best.

I want to start off by saying that according to many publications and the voice of ""the people"", the Bellagio buffet and the Wynn buffet are the most popular and highest quality buffets in Vegas. I've been to both as well as many ""lesser"" buffets in Vegas but I'm only going to compare the Bellagio and the Wynn in this review. 

In a nutshell, I like the Wynn buffet better. Quality isn't the issue, as both buffets have fresh, quality food items offered. 

I like the Wynn better because of space and location. At the Bellagio buffet, the layout is cramped and it feels like I'm in a Wal-Mart on Black Friday in Philly. Vegas is crowded, I get it. Even the biggest agoraphobe has to recognize and accept this. However, I don't want to deal with this when I'm trying to get my eat on. 

At the Wynn, the layout  feels more spacious and the tables are spaced apart enough so that even if the place was full, you feel like you're at a table in a traditional restaurant. 

Location: the Bellagio casino\/hotel is more centrally located on the strip so naturally it would attract more people to their business. With this unfortunately brings some people you don't want to be around. And when I don't want to be around them normally, I certainly don't want to be around them in a buffet. Consequently, the Bellagio seems messier and dirtier when busy for the same reason. 

The Wynn is located farther down the strip and most people don't feel like walking there. Relaxing and enjoying a good meal at their buffet is a reward for your exercise. 

I don't know, maybe I'm nuts or maybe I've been to the Bellagio when it was super busy and to the Wynn when it wasn't (dinner on a weekend should have been). 

I suppose I must talk about the food at least a little bit, we are after all reviewing a buffet. First off, you need to know that everything is fresh. Here is some of what was offered the last time I was there (a few weeks ago): a ""starter station"" (the obligatory soup and salad, Italian cured meats, cheeses, baguettes with several spreads), several types of ceviches, oysters Rockefeller, an Italian section (chicken Cacciatore, various pastas, green pea risotto), an Asian section (some stir fry, some dim sum items, sushi), a roasting\/oven station (with lamb, turkey, veal short ribs, lamb stew, and a traditional roast), a seafood section (shrimp, Alaskan crab legs) and finally a dessert station. That's just off the top of my head, I did not get to partake in every station. 

About the last sentence above, I know it's a nice place, but let's be real here, it's still a fucking buffet and you need to hunker down and EAT. Bring your family here, bring your wife\/girlfriend\/bf for a nice meal where each of you eat three small plates max but when you're ready for the pros, come alone or with a friend(s) that can put a hurt on some food. 

I enjoyed everything I had but what stood out for me was the lamb roast, the short ribs, and the oysters Rockerfeller. Everything was so good that I ate stuff I normally don't like or eat too much of like the roast turkey (Thanksgiving again, yay!) and sweets. Yeah, I'm a weirdo, I don't like sweets too much (not to mention if I eat too much I feel like dying). Anyway, I enjoyed the lime\/coconut cups and the creme brulee, both were awesome. 

Price, *meh*, If you even have the Wynn Buffet on your mind, you should be able to afford it, so don't bitch.

No matter what I always feel like fat, overfed cattle moving through a stampede. However, Vegas seems to have refined the buffet experience almost turning them gourmet. The Wynn is my best example of that.

Dining in a room that speaks of a Parisian ice cream shoppe adorned with delicate shades of lavender, mint green, and creams one feels calm and tranquil. The selection is unbeatable. At breakfast you can have all the classics along with pizza, Chinese selections, sea food, or a made-to-order omelet. The food is actually rather high quality. Nothing tastes cafeteria like, stale, or cheap. The best is the carved-to-order bacon station during breakfast. The service is always attentive and prompt always offering a fresh beverage and clearing off plates. 
The only reason I dock one star is that I dined for breakfast on a weekday, and it wasn't nearly as impressive. Its very obvious that the usually level of care and consideration was simply not there. Granted, it was about half price and we didn't wait in a 45 minute line, I was let down.

Not touting crab legs, lobster tails, or exotic ingredients like Bacchanal or Sterling, instead focusing on unique takes on breakfast standards with elegant presentations of healthful options like juice, fruit, and salads, those arriving early should check out omelet, crepe, or pancake stations before lines crepe past twenty and  with the later offering three batters plus several mix-ins and toppings the execution of the pancakes is on par with that at any number of Las Vegas Boulevard eateries, the same to be said of crunchy Waffles and golden French Toast studded with white chocolate, the Crespelles creamy as can be though a little slight in citrus.

Bolstered by refilled pots of coffee and water that was repeatedly topped off without request, Italian is well represented in pizzas as well as a few hot skillets, the ""Sinatra Family"" meatballs small but tender with a bright tomato sauce while Parmesan Chicken eats lighter than one might expect, the garlic knots and polenta also well executed, though those with more modest appetites might be well advised to avoid such ""filler.""

Passing on Sushi, Shrimp and Salmon, instead opting for a dim sum trio as well as a bowl of congee dressed up in pickled vegetables and a good bit of century egg, pork buns were unfortunately a bit bland while spring rolls and potstickers were both pleasant, the Thai style chicken wings surprisingly meaty with heat and sweetness kept in good balance.

Well represented in breakfast meats as well as roasted chicken and glazed ham, the beef rib and peppered slab bacon both missing the mark by being too dry and too heavily seasoned, respectively, macaroni and cheese sees an upgrade through the use of sharp white cheddar while Cajun Shrimp atop baked grits is one of the buffet's best bites, the same flavors not as well represented in the benedict's overly thick hollandaise.

No doubt a sucker for sweets, likely the least costly part of the buffet in terms of those looking to 'get their money's worth,' baked goods including olive loaf and focaccia are nicely made, as are croissants and danishes, a collection of bruleed oats, museli, yogurt, granola, and various fruits all quite nicely presented, the chia parfait not really my thing though the lady at a table next to mine raved about it.

Taking the Petit Four approach to desserts, low sugar and gluten-free options available to those seeking such things, cookies are a decided must-miss as none are better than those from a  package, the S'mores tart also disappointing with no smoke or graham cracker flavor evident, far better bites found in the cakes from which both Cracker Jack and Strawberry Shortcake were memorable, as too were the Apple Parfait and liquid centered Brownie, less so the sticky toffee pudding which was just sugary sweet.

Told that the bread pudding is a Wynn Signature, the Butterscotch laden scoop setting a high standard for anything one might find in all-you-can-eat form, it was perhaps even more surprising that the seasonal cobbler was a textbook rendition underneath Vanilla tinged crumble, the only thing preventing the overconsumption of each being limited remaining room in the stomach, that filled by three small scoops of ice-cream, the selection of a bowl over a fresh-made cone indicative of the amount of food eaten, but the malted version so rich and nuanced that there was some brief thought of going back for seconds.",10,4,6

Secondly, the wait time is horrible as I heard the table next to us state that they had waited more than one hour just to get in, luckily we were invited guests and walked right in, thus not worth it if you have to wait.

Price wise, dinner will easily set you back close to $50 per person including tax and tip for mediocre food, that is just too much in my book. I am generally not a buffet guy but every time I go, I get comped.

The decor is very aesthetically pleasing. Being located in a classy hotel like the Wynn one can only expect this. The bathrooms are very clean and easily placed near the eating area for one's convenience. The hostesses were very friendly as well, seating us close to the food. WIN!! :)

The food is what people come here for. They have a wide selection of choices, one will surely find something to satisfy their stomachs content. What I found most enjoyable was the beef brisket, ham, maple syrup battered fried chicken, seafood, and even Chinese DimSum like Shu Mai which I was very surprised to see. The Shu Mai here was excellent, in many ways better than NYC Chinatown Dim Sum! 

I had a pineapple juice which was tasty, as far as drinks go, they will bring you anything ranging from coffee, tea, juices, sodas, water, etc.

I ordered gluten free vegan pancakes and they were fluffy and tasty and didn't taste bland at all like many other gluten free pancakes. They have four different vegan gluten free ice creams and desserts that were decadent and tasty.

We knew we this meal would likely be our 'only' meal of the day so after a morning Starbucks for brekkie, an early dinner at 4pm would give us a solid 5-6 hours to digest the whole experience. Fortunately at this time of the day there was a zero wait in getting seated as opposed to the 45 min-hour upon our departure.
Seafood begins and ends with the crab which I believe is zuwaigani aka snow crab legs and the common other place filler cocktail shrimp. It would've been better if streaming was available but the crabmeat was sweet and delectable nonetheless. 
I enjoyed the individualized salad cups prepared nicely for smaller portion eaters as ourselves. Oh what a difference a single perfect fillet of sardine on topmcan do for me! But in addition to that, the self serve salad bar had some of the most sweetest & crispest romaine lettuce I've tasted to date, very reminiscent of some of the best farmers markets I've tried in the Bay Area. 
I wasn't a huge carbs consumer so only merely dabbled in some pasta selections which really equated to one square of finely made lobster ravioli, a tablespoon of the butternut squash risotto and in other cuisines I also enjoyed a pork belly bun Chinese style, single gyoza and an unagi nigiri. All not bad for mass produced line cooking. 
Well if that seems not enuf bang for the buck, I then concentrated my efforts on the smoked salmon, veal and enjoyed a tender medium sliver of roast beef, not the best I've have as lacked seasoning even accompanied with au jus. 
Major highlight to me was the array of cured meats namely salamis and prosciutto, the latter being my late nite snacking vice of choice. Pair those with not so bad quality cheese offerings and housemade well oiled olives it was a solid 3 stars even before the dessert run started. 
The fourth star alone was the custom crepe counter, quick trips to Harajuku came to mind as hubby satisfied himself with a simple almond encrusted chocolate saucy sensation!

Okay so this is the secret to eating buffet, you gotta go right before lunch ends and right before dinner begins, and then you get the lunch items and the dinner items (like the more expensive alaskan crab). So you get the 37.95 meal for 21.95, making it one of the best deals meal wise on the strip. You can spend 21.95 easily at any of the 24 hour cafes in the hotels on the strip, this is a much better and more delicious experience. 

the dinner menu that day included norton sound alaskan crab legs, Black jack rubbed prime rib,seven spice crusted rack of lamb, oven roasted tom turkey, lamb osso bucco, jumbo shrimp cocktail, veal short ribs, homemade pastas, different sushi, tapas, chicken soup. 

The dessert selection alone was worth the price of admission:
crepe station with fruit and chantilly cream, creme brulee, key lime pie, carrot cake, white chocolate rasberry mouse, and the ice cream bar where they scoop fresh made ice cream for you. But by the coolest dessert was their mini candied apples. YUM.",2,0,0

For brunch they had a wide variety of breakfast and lunch foods, including prime rib and various other meat cuts! Of the items I tried, I enjoyed the prime rib, this green tea blended item, the bacon, the fray tuna coconut thing, and all the various dessert items!

While it is all you can eat, I ended up getting full pretty quickly and wasn't able to try all the food items I wanted to. That being said, I somehow made room for dessert, where the creme brulee was excellent.

And at one time Wynn's Buffet could proudly strut its robes among the royalty of the many high-end restaurants found throughout this wonderland..... but like all that have ruled, it shows its age.

To support its extravagance its price has gone up significantly since I last ate here, now $54.99 for dinner on Saturday.

The decor has changed too, though I think in a beautiful manner.  Less traditional classy to a brighter and vibrant, livelier surrounding with pillowed chairs and flowery colors throughout.

But the food has definitely been impoverished.  Now everything is served lukewarm, and half the food is only fit for peasants.  Sushi that would offend the wealthy Japanese visiting.  Chinese pork belly that is inedible to aristocrats from China.  Pizza that must be laughable to the travelers from Italy.  Does the Wynn still wish to portray the grandeur of the best of America?

Apparently no longer.

It is a really nice looking buffet - the main courtyard atrium is lovely and the dessert room is stunning but I find that most of them don't taste as good as they look.

There are some really standout items at this buffet - the lox is yummy and plentiful, the super thick cut bacon is fantastic, and the soy gelato (raspberry and mint chip flavors) was outstanding.  The warm mini sticky buns in the desert section next to the bread pudding were great. The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous!  My friends really enjoyed the congee but congee isn't my thing so I can't comment on that. 

There are also things that are just ok - the pancake station doesn't actually allow you to put the various options IN the pancakes - just on top. The chocolate chips were good and melted properly but I had my heart set on some blueberry pancakes and they didn't have any fresh blueberries.  The lobster quiche had some nice pieces of lobster but the quiche itself was just kind of Blegh.

I always look for chocolate croissants (one of my favorite food items on earth) but they have a surprising lack of breakfast bread\/ pastry items (considering the giant room of deserts which I think go hand in hand).

No oysters, no crab legs, the salmon filets were dry as a bone and tremendously over cooked.

We called and was told the wait was 2 hours. Drove there in 20 Minutes and was told the wait was actually 3 hours. It took us 3 hours and 20 minuets before we got seated. We paid $645+ for 9 people. 

Finally got seated in two separate tables. This beautiful couple offered to move so we can sit together. Here comes the hostess that sat us. Her name is Cynthia. We mentioned the couple next to the one table offered to move. Oh my goodness! She gave us the dirtiest look and the fiery eyes rolling. I came up to her and asked if she heard my sister said the couple offered to move; we didn't ask. Her response was I told you can't sit together. I could have sat someone else on those tables. I just tried to help you. Wait?!!!!!! What is the problem? Help? No we paid for our food. Help? We can't eat standing up. Help? After waiting in line for 3++ hours. She needs customer service training NOW!!! Rolling your eyes and giving us the dirtiest look for something we didn't do.?! Your buffet price should commensurate with the level of customer service expected. It's fully interesting how she felt it was perfectly okay to act the way she did. The Manager Maribel listened and the server confirmed what we said all along, we didn't ask the couple to move. Why would we do that?! We have no right to asks anyone of such bold request.

The staff serving needs customer service training as well. We tried to keep a positive attitude throughout this experience. Server handling the Peking duck station, gelato station and crepe station needs to know how to respond to the words ""Thank You."" We said it multiple times and they all acted like they didn't enjoy their jobs. I asked the lady server at the sushi station which one is lobster roll. No response instead she pushed the  little plates toward me. 

The wait staff and bus staff saved the day. Friendly, helpful and smiling. 

Food is not even good. Mashed potato with black truffles not a hint of truffle.
Peking duck was a tiny sliver of duck meat (almost unnoticeable!) with cilantro. We will go back to our Thanksgiving tradition, Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. If it ain't broke, why fix it type of lesson. 

Another interesting part... hostess was going around saying if we would like to pay an additional $20 per person, we can go on the shorter line!!!!! Wow!!!! We immediately thought $80, that's for Bacchanal. 

Tea is Bigelow and honey is in a disposable plastic. The Wicked Spoon has artisanal tea and honey in a jar from Europe. 

Thanks The Buffet but you have such terrible service and so-so food. Why so many unhappy staff? They all acted like they didn't want to be there and to serve us is a  big favor.

I been to Wynn once long time ago and strongly agreed with fellow yelper Jayne L. about the food being all oh-not-so-good... but wanted to see if a high end hotel such as this has finally decided to improve on their culinary skills after my hong hiatus... so what do I think this time around?  Much Better!

Let' cut right to the chase and share the highlights...

The meats and the fish were great!  Fresh fish and tenderly grilled meats were absolutely delicious...

Crab legs were actually sensational... you know some places tends to be salty, cold, old tasting, etc.. but with this trip the crab legs were very delicious with a nice hint of sweetness to it...

What were the not so good parts?  Sushi and dessert... they still don't have a decent sushi section and dessert were very limited and is one of the only few that had only 3 items that were sugar-free.  Bellagio has like 15 items that were sugar-free and Wynn only had 3?  Boo to that!

The server we had was very attentive... weren't annoying by coming by to check on us and continue to keep the drinks filled to the rim...

Price is still high as expected so actually if I had to choose in the future I'd go elsewhere simply because it's not ""all the items"" that were good.... My favorites in Vegas are typically Makinos at the outlet\/off strip, Bellagio Buffet, Cravings at Mirage, Rio Carnival or Seafood Vllage Buffet at Rio...  So again, it's good this time around, but the price and the overall quality, I'd say that I'll come here once a while when and if I'm up for it.

If you have not tried it, do give it a shot... I think in the near future I'll do an update on this place because now it's a tie score of 1 bad and 1 good... it's time to finally see what Wynn is all about on my next visit!",12,9,10

The wait was about 30 min and I was starving by the time I was seated. So I did what every kid in a candy shop would do, but instead I am an adult and I am at a buffet- I got everything in site. I also went straight for the crab legs (like a good little Asian that I am and wanted to get my money's worth). The crab legs were alright, you can't really go wrong with that, but everything else was SO salty.

I had all the different types of pasta- all very salty

Sushi- salty again!

Garlic Bread- delicious!

Some sort of green fish with squash or string beans- salty but good!

Mango jerk chicken- dry!

The whole Mediterranean section was good! But you really can't go wrong with pita and hummus. 

Then they also have this cute cracker and dried meats and cheese section. It was nice presentation and all but nothing worth 40 bucks.

Prime rib was very bloody good so PLEASE GET THIS! When the chef was giving me my prime rib, he said ni hao ma (which would be nice if i were chinese but I'm not LOL. at least he tried)

Desserts were alright- gelato, small cakes, crepes, candied apples, cookies- I have never met a dessert I didn't like so it was all good to me!

IMPORTANT PART- if ambiance\/atmosphere\/presentation is important to you, then wynn buffet is perfect for you! Its very beautiful to look at and the food is presented in a nice way. Also, wynn's bathrooms are so gorgeous! The whole decor just seems very versailles-ish at the buffet. (maybe its because I just recently saw Marie Antoinette and now I see everything that way).

While this buffet is still the best I've eaten at (pending trying any of the other top of the line buffets in Vegas), I have to dock the Wynn 1 star for this visit unfortunately because the crab which in my previous visit were giant legs and the meat easy to take out was not the case this time.  The crab, while still a decent size was not of the same quality as before and were definitely smaller and with less meat.  The fresh oysters while tasty were not shucked properly which led to a little more effort to get at the meat which considering the quality of this place shouldn't have been an issue.  Overall, those were my only complaints as everything else was simply top notch and delicious as I expected of this buffet otherwise and I think I freaked my dad out with how much food I put away, including two plates of desert (come on, with so much good stuff to choose from for dessert, how could you not take two plates?)",0,0,0

I've been to this buffet once before for breakfast in the past and I felt like it was decent. However, we made our way here for an early dinner on a Sunday night. The wait wasn't too long as noted on previous reviews. I'm guessing since it's mid January not too many events are going on. We still waited about 15-20 minutes. 

This is an all type of people friendly buffet! Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescatarian, Carnivores, Non-Beef eaters, Non-Pork eaters, sugar free, fat free and the list goes on. Okay that may be a bit exaggerated but honestly they had so much to pick and choose from. I feel bad but I got a lamb dish when I started and there was like 4-5 other times of dishes. Their lamb chops were delicious and they had mint jelly. However, there was no chimichurri, BOO! It was limited on the spicy flavored dishes too. They had loads of crab legs chilled on ice, the carving stations were filled with beef ribs, leg of lamb, lamb chops, turkey, prime rib and etc. and the side dishes were limitless. They had a street taco station, ramen station and sushi station. It's definently well worth your money. I mean its doesn't top Bacchanal Buffet but for 10-15 dollars less and a different scenery, it's a great spot for a great meal or meals for someone people. As well as a shorter wait time!

Steve Wynn would have a thumbs up if he could see it...but it's like Martha Stewart gone wild on a bad day...

I ventured on to find something else, tomato bisque looked promising. WRONG. It was one of the worst soups I have ever had, it tasted like tomato paste in a bowl.

 The words ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT excites me. Like an ice cream truck excites kids. Like the Comic Con excites all the nerds. Like Viagra excites the impotent. Yes, AYCE gets me hard....

Hard on the wallet. This place is about $40 bucks for the Brunch price. Dinner price is a little more. They start putting dinner items out at 3pm. We came in at 230, paid the Brunch price and stayed for the dinner items. This means I ate bacon, omelettes, sausage, more bacon, eggs benedict, and crab legs! 

I honestly ate more breakfast items than dinner items. I love me some breakfast and there is something about their eggs benedict that kept me coming for more. 

They also have a great selection of desserts.

This place won me over the first time I ate here.  It was like my first time having sex, so many things to explore, new tastes, plenty to grab, it was AMAZING.

Now this place is just ok. I wish I popped some Viagra before I ate here just so I can relive that excitement.

We didn't plan this, it just kind of worked out that way. HAHA. I must say the decor of this buffet is AMAZING. The main hall is filled with flowers as if you're in a conservatory. Very pretty and even if the flowers are articifial it still looks really classy. Although we didn't get a table in the floral hall because it was full, we seated at the side rooms which is just normal decor. Okay so there's a lot of hype for the fancier casino's buffets like Wynn, Bellagio, and Venetian. Although the food was good, it didn't live up to the expectations I had. Maybe because a majority of my experience was from breakfast food, but the lunch food did look pretty good from what I remembered. I was full off the breakfast food so I only had half a plate of lunch food. I had smoked salmon with cream cheese and capers, which always a nice compliment to breakfast. I was hoping for fresh waffle\/pancake station, but they were already premade and soggy. I ate them anyway with strawberry compote. Loved the compote, but I guess you can't really mess that up. For lunch items I tried the mashed potatoes, which were presented nice and I think they puree it. I also tried the corn flake chicken, good but too greasey.

No problem, she was fine with it and charged us for 3 adults. We get up to the front to be seated and are told that we need to go back and pay for our son. We explained again that he would not be eating from the buffet and that the cashier had said it was fine. The woman proceeded to argue with us and then went and got her manager. The very young female manager (didn't catch her name) came over and proceeded to tell us that we needed to pay for our son and that due to health code violations, we were not allowed to bring in any outside food.  We are not there to violate health codes, so we agreed that we would not give him any of the food that we brought while we were in the restaurant.  She then threatened that if our son ate anything from the buffet, we were going to be charged.
 Her attitude was condescending and she appeared to be very inexperienced, especially in the customer service department. We were not trying to get a free meal for our kid. We had just paid $75 to eat there, but we did not want to pay for an extra plate just to pay.

There wasn't a lot of seafood. There was one chilled seafood section and all they had were crab legs and shrimp cocktail and some tuna seaweed salad. At these prices, I expect oysters and clams as well as I've seen them at buffets that charge much less. 

There was another section that served ramen. We tried the miso ramen. Super disappointing as it was completely tasteless. 

There was an Asian section but it offered like 4-5 items like egg rolls and wonton. Very disappointed at the selection of food there. 

The italian section was a little better as it had chicken, fish, pasta and it was all decent. Next to the italian section was a charcuterie section. There were a variety of cold cuts but no prosciutto. Another disappointment. 

The desserts, like the other sections, lacked variety and even the basics. I was craving a chocolate cake and didn't see one slice of chocolate cake. I think chocolate cake is such a basic staple. Every buffet dessert section should have at least that. They served candied apples, little cupcakes, lots of mousses and most of which were overly sweet. I tried a taste of everything. Their best dessert was their pistachio gelato...it is the only reason why they got a 3-star review from me.

I've been here twice but I still salivate thinking about that culinary experience here. I'm not giving it 5 stars because as good as it is, it's not perfect. But first, the GOOD STUFF: king crab legs, fresh shrimp, smoked salmon, prime rib, roast turkey. Honest to God, both times I ate here I devoured about a dozen king crab legs and a plate of shrimp, followed by three slices of that prime rib. They also have fresh salads and soups, a gazpacho bar, yummy Italian dishes,  and other fabulous sides. And dessert.  Bread pudding, an ice cream counter, creme brulee, tapioca pudding, tarts, cookies, crepes, you name it. The only thing I wish they had was a better selection of pie and cake...sometimes you don't want fancy stuff. The BAD STUFF: the so-called Asian favorites. The potstickers and fried rice taste like kindergarten art project paste and I didn't bother with the entrees. Also, if you don't get there early, you could be waiting for over an hour. And yes, it's pricey. But think of all the quality food you can shovel in. Crab legs that size usually cost 40 bucks for maybe two...might as well pay that and get all the other stuff for free.

If you want to be chingchonglinglong cheap, you should get your butt in line around 2:45pm (depending on what day it is of course) to pay the lunch price and get dinner food.

STEP TWO:
Sit yourself down in the garden themed rooms and stuff yourself with an unlimited amount of dericious prime rib, mashed potatoes, CREME BRULEE, cocktail shrimp, etc. 

STEP THREE: 
When 3:25pm rolls around, stop stuffing yourself and get in line for KING CRAB LEGS. 

STEP FOUR:
While you're in line, do some jumping jacks and lunges to lose some of the food baby.

STEP FIVE:
Proceed to pile your plate, or plateS, with the fattest, cleanest, freshest, and longest king crab legs you'll ever see. (While you're near the seafood section, stop by and grab some more refill of cocktail shrimp)

STEP SIX:
Repeat steps 2, 4, and 5 until you LITERALLY cannot walk without looking pregnant anymore.

As others have stated the service is really poor.  I literally couldn't even get the waiter to look at me.  The selection was kind of small.  In my head I had imagined a Vegas buffet to be an expansive feast especially when you are paying so much but it wasn't that way at all.  I liked the food fine but my husband thought it was disguising and he barely nibbled at the plate.  They had a salad bar to the far right, followed by cheese, then they had an Italian section (pasta).  Probably the most disappointing part was the meat selection: fatty prime rib, fatty meatloaf, fatty sausage links, fatty brisket, and fatty waffled fried chicken.  I'm not even kidding!  They literally served the most fattening cuts of meat and took the one healthy option and fried it in waffle batter.  I think for this price they should have offered a roasted chicken or something of the sort.  After the meats they presented oil soaked cauliflower then Asian food, and finally shellfish.  The crab legs looked nice but buffet shellfish scared me so I didn't try them.

The most impressive part was the dessert area.  I really loved the beautifully entry looking back into the glass paneled pastry kitchen.  If you can get a seat looking into the pastry kitchen I recommend it.  They had a wonderful selection of the desserts.  I tried 4 of them and most of them were pretty good.

I still wonder if maybe I wasn't missing something, some corridor that I did not explore, because I hardly considered myself overwhelmed by the options.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe people shouldn't throw around adjectives like ""huge"" and ""crazy big"" since this girl will spin it into a food utopia.  Whichever the case, I do not want to belittle the selection too much because there is a lot to choose from.  There just weren't any food mountains.  And I found that disappointing.

That being said, the buffet has good variety for both carnivores and vegetarians, even a vegan option or two, and everything is yummy to really yummy.  The waitstaff attentively removes plates and refills drinks so you can focus solely on gorging yourself instead of flagging someone down for more water or booze.

The soups they have are sweeter, and I always find myself craving them. In fact they're the reason I keep returning to this buffet.

Be prepared to wait for at least an hour, even if you get there EARLY (we got there around 4pm). If you arrive around the typical dinner time, the wait is much longer.

They definitely focus on quality over quantity here. But that's not to say they don't have a vast selection of different foods. The lamb is delicious, and the salads are fresh.

Our friend have flew from mid west and this was there first trip to to vegas and they were really excited about the buffet so we also joined them for the buffet. I will start with the experiences we had regarding this buffet. We chose Wynn reading some of the reviews and thinking that it should be nice as its in one of the best hotels on strips but all the high hopes came down crumbling down. The line and waiting was long when i say long i mean close to 2hrs. One of our family friends who went to cancun called us before boarding the flight and then when they reached US and we were still standing in the line for the buffet. Once we reached the cash counter we came to know that for the holiday season they only have the brunch during the weekend which shot the price up straight up from the 22$ to 37$ per person. We were able to get a group table and then we started to explore the buffet and to my disappointment the buffet was really small as per the price they charge. There was hardly any thing i will say that I really like and I am really into food and like to try lot of tasty stuff. If you compare this with the spice buffet of Planet hollywood this doesnt even start the chance. The asian and mexican were the worst which doesnt even have the basic things which you will find @ every place ...neways then i moved to the salad and soup bar and i will say that was the saviour for me. Sea food was also not good and there was nothing in the name of the sushi:(. i will say that the dessert options were good but still not the standard for the Wynn. I think they need to improve a lot if they need to get a good name for the buffet, i think the only reason people go there is coz of the name of Wynn and then get surprised with the less options for the buffet. Word of advise for the people who are planning to try the buffet, make sure the price is around 22$ (then its ok to pay for the quality of food you get) , its no where close to the 37$ value. All the best and enjoy your stay @ vegas.",0,0,0

PROS: 
- Shrimp Shu Mai dimsum was good.
- Their tiramisu cup was yummy! their other desserts were okay.  I didn't try the crepe station, but it looked tasty!

CONS: 
- Crab legs were inedible and old. I didn't like the way they split them because it defeats the purpose of eating crab legs.  
- Pizza slices were REALLY greasy
- Lobster bisque - very salty and inedible
- Pumpkin ravioli - if you like the canned pumpkin puree and ravioli, eat this. Otherwise, I was very disappointed.

There were other items we tried but those listed were very disappointing for the price of almost $45 per person.

But food is just okay to be honest. The crab meat isn't as sweet or plentiful compared to other buffets and the meats are too undercooked. Even though I asked for a medium portion, my prime rib was leaking blood. Nothing tastes particularly great, the desserts aren't that good either.

Obviously, buffets in Vegas are normally pricey which is fine. But in a fancy hotel, I expect the service to be better. I didn't tip at the front where you pay because I usually tip at the table. I wrote that I would tip at the table though, but the cashier in a bold red sharpie wrote ""No Tip"" all over the receipt. It could be possible that she didn't believe me, but whether I did or not, I find that very.... unprofessional for someone who works in customer service. There are better ways to say things, even a ""N.T"" perhaps. Many customers would find this action offensive. When the server at our table looked at our receipt even his behavior was different at first. Until we tipped him then he was very attentive afterwards. He went from being okay to extra nice.",1,0,1

When I went everything was self service but they did have a few live stations were food is made upon request such as the pasta station. Every pasta dish that I tried was tasty but my favorite was the lasagne. At the asian station I enjoyed some sushi which all tasted very fresh.

I would LOVE IT if Steve would actually eat in his own buffet so he could see what it has become. When we were here years past the quality of the food was so much better (but the service was lacking). Now it's the opposite-- the service is good but you can really notice the decline in the food (cuts of meat, etc). And, two small glasses of wine will set you back a good $25. 

I know it's the strip and I don't mind paying $40 a person IF the food is good (you'd pay that in a decent restaurant anywhere else). My problem is that the Wynn prides itself on quality... 

Actually, to be honest I've decided I now officially hate buffets. I can't stand watching people stuffing themselves and coming back to their table with plates piled high with 50+ crab legs. Not to mention the amount of food that is wasted is ridiculous.

I ended up here with two relatives during the transition between brunch buffet and dinner because they were given free buffet tickets as part of a promotional package at the Wynn Casino and I decided to join them. Both of them, who have eaten at several buffets in their lifetime said that the food didn't taste fresh. One of them preferred the buffet at the Pala Casino in California. I didn't particularly enjoy anything they put out. They attempted a variety of international foods but the California rolls were dry and a little stiff. One of my relatives compared it to grocery store sushi (and I've had grocery store sushi that tasted a lot better). I'm not a fan of meat and seafood but I love noodles and pasta and this place was lacking in impressive and filling noodle and pasta dishes. They did have made to order korean pancakes which were rather flavorful and some interesting pizza choices which included bacon and manchego cheese.

The desserts were definitely the highlight. I really enjoyed their green tea pudding with chia seeds, as well as their green tea lychee cupcake and thai tea cup. The desserts also include a gelato \/ ice cream selection as well as made to order crepes. Everything came in small portions so you can sample a little of everything without overindulging.

I noticed a few vegan dessert options, which was nice for those on restricted diets but not many sugar free desserts, and the guava juice in little jars was cute and refreshing.

Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend going out of your way to visit this buffet and but if you're staying in the hotel, especially if they offer you free buffet tickets as part of a promotional package, I don't think it would be too painful of an experience. Just don't expect to be wowed.",1,0,0

I researched the best buffets in Vegas before I came because I am much more interested in food then gambling.  I told my fiance that this was the one thing I wanted to do in Vegas and he could be in charge for the rest of the trip.  I was so pleased with our visit!  I loved the ravioli, the Asian chicken wings, and the salads among all of the things I tried.  I loved that I could try new cuisine without worrying that I would order an entire meal that I didn't like.  I tried a little bit of everything and felt so good afterwords.  I also loved sitting in the garden area.  It was beautiful!",0,0,0

Food:
Prime Rib - tender as ever can be
Lamb Racks - so much flavor
Oysters -  ehhh, but w\/e its oysters
Alaskan King Crab - so rich and succulent

Those were some of the main highlighted food at this buffet that I would eat for the rest of my life. All the other foods are just as good as well.

Their desserts are outta this world too. The strawberry sorbet and other gelatos are really good. The key lime pie mousse is crazy too should try that one out.

The food is without question great. The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is that the service is just ehh and the tables are extremely tight. They fit 4 people into a really small square table that can barely fit more than 1 plate per person. And with the drinks and other condiments on the table as well, it's pretty tightly packed.

Other than that, the ambiance and atmosphere is great inside the Wynn Buffet. A must try if you're in Vegas. Might as well gamble for 5 minutes less, take that $20 and spend it here!",0,0,0

Out of all the buffets in Las Vegas this one is the worst. Bachannal Buffet and Wicked Spoon are much better. The atmosphere here looks like a cheap Disneyland. Decor is disgusting and makes you lose your appetite. Customer service is even worse. They discriminate against people with tattoos and have a strict dress code. For lunch you need to be covered from head to toe. I have personally seen people get escorted for the way they are dressed even though they were accepted at the front and paid for their buffet.

The reason - quality.

While they don't offer nearly as much in terms of variety, they make it up by making sure everything they serve is top notch.  The crab legs here are the best versus any other buffet I've been to, bar none.  Same goes for the prime rib, lamb chops and also their pasta and carnitas stations.  The flavor of all the dishes are excellent and even their breakfast options are good.  The fresh strawberries they serve is almost worth the price of admission alone.

The dessert stations here are also top notch.  The gelato they offer is excellent and I still can't get over how good their vanilla bean gelato is after all these years.

The place itself was beautiful, very simple and elegant. It felt like I was in some sort of a tea party environment. The clam chowder soup was delicious, it tasted was it was freshly made. Lots of varieties from different ethnicity such as American, Italian, and Asian food. For Italian food, there's pasta entrees and Asian food had shrimp dumplings (dim sum) and sushi with raw smoked salmon. American food had prime rib, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc. My boyfriend had the best prime rib from here because it was rare just how he liked it. We're both seafood lovers, so we had a generous amount of crab legs and it was sliced in half so no need to worry about cracking the shells. It was also warm so it was just about right to enjoy the crab. The dessert section was something I couldn't end my dinner without. They had marshmallow lollipops (marshmallow dipped in white or chocolate with sprinkles on top) which I thought it was pretty cute and creative for a simple dessert. There were a lots of cupcakes, cakes, and gelato! If only my stomach could devoured it all, I would if I could. The mini red velvet cupcake really caught my eye since it was sprinkled with glitter and I had to get it!

The decoration was beautiful and  it seemed to have the magic to open up your appetite with colorful fruits and flowers hanging from atop. It was a bright place as they did an excellent job welcoming more lighting into this buffet restaurant. The flowers, fruits, and lighting made the place a happy place to eat. In my opinion, the buffet at Wynn's has the most memorable and the most pleasant design among all of its competitors.
However the quality of food was not quite as five star as the decoration. Some foods were better than others in terms of quality, delicacy, freshness and preparation. The charcuterie section was outstanding which gave out marinated juicy short ribs and pork loins. Seafood was fine but the tuna poke was not the freshest. The Chinese food counter served this large piece of Gai Lan vegetable which could have been cut into smaller pieces to be easily consuming. The salad corner was not positioned well as the plates were sitting right below the salad on the far left side (from diner's view) and created a risk of having diner accidentally drop food to the clean plate. That happened to me. I would recommend to rearrange the location of the plates to avoid this issue. As for the desserts, I tried a bunch of variable ones. They were quite good!  Overall the food was OK. 
Customer service varies based on personnels. The host was cold and should make some efforts to work on her smile. Our server was very nice, attentive and polite; she set up a great example for my kids to learn about manners in general. Cashiers were polite as well.

As I walked in I had great expectations. Everything was decorated with vibrant colors, beautiful detailed columns and wonderful patterns painted throughout. Everything was clean and cute. However, my expectations were abruptly faltered as I began looking for actual food.

As I looked around there seemed to be a lot of options from a range of cuisines. I decided to stay safe with mashed potatoes, fried chicken, and salmon. The fried chicken had several little bones throughout and the mashed potatoes were very mediocre. The salmon was absolutly horrific with the fishiest taste I had ever tasted. My second round I ordered the Peking duck and although it tasted good, the service was terrible. The man making the duck sandwich was extremely rude. As I was asking him for what I needed he barely made eye contact nor did he acknowledge my presence. When I asked for two he merely grunted and presumably gave me one. 

All the other foods were either very mediocre. And as a warning: do not order any of the seafood related foods such as fish, sushi, or lobster bisque. Every single one of those items are extremely fishy. The quality is very bad.

The only saving grace of this buffet are the gourmet tacos (which aren't gourmet, just your normal food truck taco) and the desert options.

We were seated in a private room with the rest of the guests. The room itself was a little dated and kind of cramped but it was also separate and apart from the ravenous hordes and we didn't have to stand in line trying to get in. The buffet alone is about $36 with a $16 unlimited drinks (if it's THAT kind of morning.) 

The Buffet is something you'll need to see to believe. It's a city block of every food imaginable. Caloric and catholic guilt about excess kicked in hard but I valiantly pushed both aside to honor my buffet commitment.

Foods on that buffet include (but are not limited to): salami, proscuitto, olives, cheddar cheese, jack cheese, swiss cheese, BYObruschetta, fresh juices, chicken noodle, tomato, french onion soups, rigatoni, spaghetti, lobster frittatta, turkey, ham, bacon, more bacon sliced off a slab of bacon, egg whites, scrambled eggs, an omelette station, migas, a pancake station, pizza (four kinds), lox, bagels, sushi, dumplings, pork buns, thai chicken wings, beans, rice, tacos, profiteroles, eclairs, gelato (20 kinds), pie, custards, tarts, cookies, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, more bacon and a salad bar (which no one touched.)

I tried so hard to take a bite of each of these things and mostly succeeded. Also, in the middle of my meal, my fitness pal reminded me to log my calories. Thanks universe -- you jerk. The kicker here is that it's all so mediocre. Like any giant college lunchroom-style buffet, nothing is a standout. Go for the sheer audacity of having that much food available, to take pics and impress your friends and because it's a story to tell over cocktails -- don't go expecting to be blown away by the high quality of the food.

We were welcomed with such a beautiful sight in their atrium area. It was bright, colorful, and beautifully decorated. The receptionist seated us there but because it was by the entrance where all the people in line can watch you eat, we asked for a different table inside. They were very accomodating and had us moved right away. 

Food selection was not overwhelming. It was just enough to really enjoy what was good. My favorites are the carving station which had prime rib and a slab of bacon, their orecchiette pasta with pesto and pine nuts, maple fried chicken that went well with their bacon waffles, congee station, and the shrimp cocktail. 

Around 3pm, they closed the pancake station so I was disappointed I didn't get the chance to try their blueberry corn pancake. But lo and behold, they started changing the dishes for the dinner buffet!! Roasted leg of lamb and turkey was added on to the carving station, pancake station converted to pasta station, the seafood selection widened with the addition of ahi poke salad, fresh oysters and KIng crab legs, while in their dessert area, they opened up a crepe station! For $35, I think it was well worth it! 

Shoutout to our server who was ever so efficient in getting and refilling our beverages and taking our dirty plates away. I wish I had gotten his name. But God bless you!

However, it turns out, the price isn't so bad since they serve Prime Rib, Lamb, Quail, Mussel, ribs, and quality food. I'm not even joking that even at $46, it is worth the price.

They had a huge selection and any of their Meats are a solid choice to pick from and things like the Mac and Cheese and Ribs blew me out of the water.

Their weakness seems to be Asian dishes which includes the sushi or gyozas and fish. Other than Cha Siu, every Asian dish wasn't really as fresh as it should be compared to LA or my hometown in Santa Barbara.

Artsy or not, you're gonna wanna come here for the food. By golly was it decadently flavorful and impressively diverse. 

My parents and I came here on Tuesday to intimately wrap up the line of celebrations my mom had for her birthday, in what I believe is one of the best buffets in town. (and no, overrated is not a word I would even associate with the Buffet at the Wynn) There were no lines that day (although a sign did say that proper attire was required - ""Gentlemen, no sleeveless shirts. Ladies: Opaque cover-ups) Food choices, arrangements and staff were all out fantabulous - simply top-notch. Being the nature person that I am, the flower\/fruit decorations (and hummingbird paintings) that greeted us as we entered the dining area didn't cease to amaze me. 

I particularly loved how the roast beef, mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts with onions complimented each other. Shrimp tempura sushi, seaweed cucumber salad, smoked salmon topped with soy sauce tasted just as great. There was a wide array of stations - Asian, Seafood, Italian etc. and a special room filled with desserts - let's talk gelato, candy apples, rocky road, chocolate shots, raspberry cheesecake, chocolate coated rice crispy squares, tres dulces. I could go on forever. Admittedly, I couldn't settle with just a couple of helpings when it came to the sweet stuff and ended up trying almost every bit of what they had. 

By the time 3:30pm came - and papa initially hoped to grab a handful of snow crab legs once they rolled in at that time - we were more stuffed than we had intended to and decided to start pacing ourselves out to burn the calories off.",3,2,3

I paid $46 for the ""Holiday Weekday Special"" and waited 2 hours for a shockingly small selection of food. What a rip. If you read the reviews, everyone mentions the king crab legs and the prime rib, because YES, that's basically everything they have to offer. I would only come here if you are a really, really, REALLY big fan of both (and can eat $46 worth. and deal with waiting 2 hours in line.)

I would say that despite the small selection, the quality of the crab legs, prime rib, and grilled\/poached fish selections were good. But where was the rack of lamb? the raw bar? anything else I would associate with a buffet? When you walk around, the space is decently sized, but when you look at the counterspace, nothing is actually there!! Basically, I felt that they took every large section of a buffet (meat, seafood, sushi, cheese) and condensed it to a few selections.

At the very least, I was looking forward to the desserts. I absolutely  love dessert displays. At Jean-Phillipe Patisserie in the Aria, I was salivating at the counter, lusting after their gorgeous desserts. Not so at the Wynn Buffet. I picked up a creme brulee and a crepe because nothing else looked appealing but did not finish either. In fact, the crepe kind of made me angry! The skin was brittle and lacked the heady aroma of ANY crepe I've had before (including my own!) And well, don't get me started on that 'filling'. My friends, who tried a wider selection of the desserts, were equally unimpressed (though perhaps less angry than me).

Well, I give it five stars because it far exceeded any expectation I had of what a buffet is.

At roughly $45 per person, this is hardly a bargain. However, if you have a couple of hours to kill and you are disciplined enough to pace yourself, you are in a for a treat after treat after treat.
The best time to come on a weekend is at 10:00am. Any later than that and you'll be waiting in line for over an hour; almost two hours at around 12:00pm. Nothing is worth standing in line for that long.

The dining room is bright. The chairs are comfortable. There's elbow room and plenty of room to walk between your table and the food stations.

I prefer bite size servings at buffets, so Asian dumplings, Vietnamese spring rolls, Chinese stuffed mushrooms and things of that sort are a favorite way to start the meal...I then work my way up the line.

Avoid foods like potatoes, any type of pasta, bread, sushi, or the classic carving board offerings...or salad, for that matter. You can have those any time. Stick to the less common stuff and you'll still not be able to try it all. 

By the way, the little transparent cup with the red and yellow filling topped with a raspberry on the bottom right of the desserts image is a tropical fruit pudding\/jelly\/custardy thing that made my toes curl with joy...just sayin'.

While I loved the quantity of selection (redundant?) at the Wynn buffet (5 kinds of ceviche? Hell, yeah!) the quality was another thing. 

Aforementioned ceviche was great flavor-wise but did not have much actual seafood (I know, I know, they have to have filler but only getting two tiny pieces of tuna in 2 scoops of ceviche is just not right). The salmon and sea bass were quite dry and that strange artichoke dish was just bizarre. All of the pasta dishes were bland.

The good: chicken noodle soup made with real chicken stock, tender sliced beef with to-die for jus, amazing mashed potatoes (maybe I'm just easily impressed by butter), green beans, guacamole and the white chocolate crunchy cake. We got one of every dessert and that was by far the best. Runner up would be the orange tapioca. Sad, sad selection of puny slices of only 3 kinds of fruit, though.

Like with most buffets, not all dishes are created equally, but if you choose the right stuff, you'll get the most of your money and enjoy every indulgent bite.

I suggest avoiding the sushi section altogether and cocktail shrimp and limiting your dessert intake (I remember only liking the butterscotch pudding out of everything I had tried).  Wynn's desserts aren't bad, but most of them were just mediocre.  It's best not to waste your calories on anything below stellar.

You may want to try the crab legs, but I personally have high standards for crab and would pay $40 for good crab rather than the same amount of unlimited crappy crab.  To each their own.

If you're a meat eater, congratulations, you've arrived in heaven!  Not that the vegetarian selection is bad--far from it!  There's a fantastic salad bar, a mouthwatering spread of cheeses, and the two times I went, vegetarian curries and dumplings that I thought were delish, as well as cooked collards and yams.  You can also order pasta or noodles with the toppings of your choice (I love the pesto!).  But seriously, the meat is the best part.  I don't even like meat that much but the super bacon (I forget the name of it, but I saw someone else on Yelp call it that) was probably one of the most memorable things I have ever eaten in my life.  I was also a huge fan of the veal short ribs and the prime rib.  

Other things I recommend would be the leek and pork dumplings (I almost could not stop eating them even though I knew there were so many other goodies to be had!).  I didn't have high expectations for the Asian section, but those dumplings were definitely the bomb!",10,5,8

My friend and her family and i came here for brunch. 
it's pretty pricey. 
Its around $30 per person
but her parents paid for me, thank you so much Mr. and Mrs. F.

so this place had a lot of flowers, and kind of reminded me of alice and wonderland, i have no clue why. 

anyways. 
their food was pretty good. 
they had breakfast food such as fruit, waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs, and they made fresh omlettes. 
also, they had like sushi and pasta, and just tons of food. 

everything was pretty good. 

they had this dessert section, which we got to sit near. 
and you can see the chef making the pastries. 

and so anyways their dessert section was filled with cookies, cakes, pies, and those caramel apple on a stick. omg. it was all so yummy!

i had like one of each on my plate minus the caramel apple, all these people started to look at me like dang, what a fatty. but who cares its a buffet which cost $30. 

My friend didn't eat that much, but i'm pretty sure i ate her moneys worth, because of all the dessert i had ate!

can't wait to go their again!

thank you to her parents again!",2,3,1

Pros:  The desserts were good, definitely on par with Bellagio.  The prime rib was juicy and the au jus was good.  I'm weird and usually pour the au jus in a sauce bowl to dip my prime rib in instead of pouring it on top.  The rack of lamb was spiced up and a little spicy.  Different than the traditional spices at Bellagio, but good nonetheless.  They also did a lamb t-bone where the first piece was perfectly tender but the second piece was dry.

Special Tip:  We like our crab legs hot and they serve it cold here.  I just take the crab legs and shrimp to the grill station and they turn out wonderfully grilled and warm.

Cons:  The crepe station was not worth the wait since everything just seemed cobbled together.  Our waitress didn't check on us often.  They only have one place for the king crab legs so there's usually a line.  It seemed like all of the fish dishes were heavily spiced, some to the point where it overwhelmed the fish and that's not good.",0,0,0

the wynn buffet is GREAT. notice now i said ""great"", by all means that DEFINITELY does not mean perfect. it is STILL a buffet and food is definitely not cooked for you personally nor on the spot. You still overwhelm your taste buds with a variety of flavors which just arent supposed to go together so that you can ""get your money's worth"".. many of times that's why people say the food sucks.

they have rack of lamb, and it is delicious, that is very impressive in my opinion. their seafood is CLEANED SUPER WELL, which is worth 50 bucks in itself. the king crab legs are cracked open for you with self serve melted butter so that all you have to do is scoop it out with a fork. the shrimp is de shelled for you so that you're not making a complete mess of your table. 

this is a great buffet, the wait is long (i waited 45 minutes), the price is 50 for dinner. i DEFINITELY recommend this buffet.

So knowing that, here are tips to get the most out of your Wynn Buffet experience.  First, eat fruit for breakas, skip lunch, and line up for an early dinner buffet at 4pm.  The dinner line that begins at 6pm is insane, so I would avoid that if possible.  
The premade salads are remarkable so try those instead of making your own (you can do that anywhere).  Next hit the seafood bar.  The crab legs are the best I've had in a restaurant experience.   And if you are lucky, they'll have some sort of tuna tartare to garnish your seafood plate.  Next, try the roasted rack of lamb or the prime rib.  The lamb is better in my opinion so I tend to go for that.  There's a risotto bar where you can choose your own ingredients and they'll cook it right in front of you.  
The dessert bar is delectable and a must.  I don't know how much they vary from week to week.  If you can get one of their shots of strawberry shakes, then it's your lucky day.  The gelato bar is incredible (almost matchin the quality that you can find at the gelato cafe in the bellagio) and the pastries are heavenly.",2,0,0

He has stayed at the hotel many times and lived in Vegas for a couple of years.  Anyways, I figured with the Wynn reputation that it would be great.  I still went on Yelp and Travel Advisor to check out what other people had to say.  Yelp was a little mixed, while Travel Advisor was more positive.  Both sites said the wait could get a little long.  So we decided to go for an early dinner.  We got their early and luckily there was no wait.  They still had lunch prices, but were serving the dinner food.  Boy am I glad about that.  The Lunch price was about $25, while dinner was about $40.  Had I paid the $40, I would have given it 1 star.  It's nowhere near worth $40.  The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The fanciest things they had were crab legs, shrimp cocktail, fancy cheese and meats.  The crab legs were already cut in half, so that was nice.  They had about 7 different stations with about 4 items to choose from each one.  They had seafood which was just the shrimp and crab legs.  They had japanese food for which they had about 4 different sushi rolls.  They had dumplings and a couple other things for the chinese station.  They also had a taco station for mexican.  The meat station had prime rib cooked to 2 temperatures which was overcooked and raw(I like mine medium) and a whole turkey.  The italian station had lasagna and 3 more items.  For the fancy meat and cheese station, they had about 3 of each.  They had a basic salad station.  However, they had a huge selection for dessert.  They had something for everybody.  Please don't go thinking you will get Wynn quality, because you definitely will not get that.  With reading the reviews, I didn't go in with sky high expectations.

I dined at the Wynn buffet when they first opened over 3 years ago and wasn't impressed then, and I am not impressed now.  Let me break it down for you:

* Seafood station: the only worthwhile item of the bunch were the freezing cold crab legs.  You could only find smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail here -- whoopdeedo.  No raw oysters will be found here.

* Sushi: three types of ""pseushi"" ‚Ñ¢ (Ken K.) consisting of California rolls, vegetarian rolls, and last but not least, Salmon maki rolls.  No sashimi, no nigiri.  They even had this pathetic seaweed salad that was 10% seaweed and 90% celery.  Oh, and not to mention they offered kimchee, because kimchee is so appropriate for sushi.

* Carving station: prime rib, turkey, and rack of lamb.  Everything was fine here, except for the angry carving station lady who couldn't cut the meat properly because she was under-slicing the meat, so she kept losing grip of the knife and thus, splattering beef juice on the customers.  She expressed no apologies for splashing beef juice on the nice blouse of the poor girl in front of me.  Not to mention, when I asked for a more rarer lamb chop (seeing that an entire uncut rack was in front of me), she proceeded to give me a well-done lamb chop that was leftover from everyone else's pickings.  How rude!

* Dessert station: alluring desserts that tasted horrible.  Stay away from the dry cupcakes, rock hard poppy seed lemon pastry, mediocre cookies, and way-too-thick crepes.  The ice cream was delish though.

* Other pathetic and disappointing offerings: hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, miso soup, and tons of baked bread as fillers.

The only things keeping the Wynn buffet from plummeting to a 1-star review is their beautiful dining area, amazing vanilla ice cream, tasty lamb chops (when given the perfect medium rare piece), and the attentive service.

Take my advice though, and spend your $50 elsewhere.  Las Vegas has so many other great dining establishments that are well worth the money spent.  The Wynn buffet is just not one of those.",18,15,17

I went to this Buffet on the recommendation of a friend who said it is the BEST buffet in Sin City.  Well, I haven't been to other buffets in Vegas but I can say this one who pretty awesome.

To the negative reviewers I would remind you that this is an all-you-can eat buffet for $40.

Overall the food was of very high quality, and was being prepared fresh in cooking stations behind the buffet; there was no wondering how long ago the food was prepared and was sitting there.  There was a genuine effort to provide inspired, near-gourmet quality food, again as close as you can get in a buffet service.

Food was organized in stations by cuisine, I'll try to list what there was from memory - this is not the complete list, just what I can remember, I added comments on what I tried.

SEAFOOD
- Shrimp (Nice large shrimp with cocktail sauce & fixins)
- Smoked Salmon on toasts with NY style fixins (very nice quality salmon)
- Crab Legs - Mounds of them (delish, with drawn butter))
- Oysters Rockefeller (yummy)
- Sushi - several kinds of Sushi and Sashimi (nice and fresh, flavorful)
- Tom Kar Gai soup (Shrimp Coconut\/Thai)
- Seafood Pot Pie

INDIAN
- Curried Chick Peas (nice flavor)
- Curried Lentils
- Hummus & Nan
- Tandoori Chicken (Very nice)

MEATS
- Prime Rib (did not try, but looked good)
- Kobe Beef Meatloaf (very tasty & moist)
- Brisket, Ancho flavored with Ancho BBQ sauce (nice flavor)
- Lamb Loin Chops (2 flavors, perfectly done - Garlic\/Rosemary & Mediterranean Spice)
- Turkey Breast sliced with Thanksgiving fixins'

ITALIAN
- Papardelle 
- Tortellini carbonara
- 3 thin-crust pizzas (nice & crispy)
- Chicken Scallopini Milanese
- Antipasto bar (did not try but nice selection of meats cheeses olives etc)
- Bruschetta station - toasts with several toppings to choose from

SALADS
- Cesar - made to order bar
- Beet & Orange Salad (delish)
- Roasted Butternut Squash Salad topped with roasted marshmallows
- Traditional Green Salad bar

SOUPS
- Chicken Noodle (Did not try)
- Clam Chowder (NE Style, did not try)

DESSERTS
- Key Lime Mousse (tangy & tasty)
- Warm Brownie (with fudge sauce)
- Warm Bread Pudding (with bourbon sauce) - delish
- Creme Brulee
- Rocky Road brownies
- Carrot Cake
- Black Forest Cake
- 3 kinds of mini cupcakes
- Several flavors of Gelato + toppings (I had Coconut with toasted coconut; yum - then ended my meal with Chocolate & Vanilla Bean together)

Soda was included at no cost; a glass of Pinot Noir was $14 add'l.  Some had ordered Mimosa's and the wait staff were walking around with pitchers refilling them, so they must have a bottomless deal.

I did arrive early, about 630 - and there was no wait; but there was a line buy the time I left so you may want to get there on the early side if you want to avoid the wait.

Overall, I gave the buffet 4 stars -- 5 stars would have required truly gourmet gourmet food, which again I think would be extremely difficult to accomplish at a volume buffet.  I think this is about as good as it could get.....kudos to the folks at Wynn!",7,0,3

well in all cases of vegas buffets on the strip, youre going deal with 2 things, first youre gonna run into a line.  well actually, its a line, so there probably wont be any running involved, unless you need to run to the restroom due to the previous night's debauchery.  waiting in line sucks, but you gotta do that no matter what if you wanna eat a buffet.  second thing is the price.  $40 more or less seems to be the vegas standard.  i think most people in vegas already expect this if theyre planning on buffet'ing.  in my case, im not rich, so this is alot of money for me.  so if youre like me, it might help to think that if you get at least 3 plates, youve already covered your cost, just sayin.

good:
now for the good stuff.  FOOD!!
that is why you came to the buffet.  from what i can remember about this place, i really liked the prime rib and the sushi wasnt too bad either.  im a huge sushi nazi, but its vegas, i trust some asian man is working behind the scenes rolling out rice and fish.  i think vegas is the only place where you'd eat prime rib, sushi, and enchilada in one meal.

so ya, i lied, i really didnt talk about specifics, oh well, hahah, but this place is decent, food was good, it was replenished often, servers were prompt, all things that a proper buffet oughta be, the end.",0,1,0

Quick verdict: If you love love dessert, the Wynn Buffet is for you! 
If not, you're better off at the buffets inside the Bellagio, Rio or Planet Hollywood.

For some reason, I've never really been impressed with the Wynn Buffet.  Sure it's nice, but every time I go (and I don't know why I go), I always come away unsatisfied. Yes, I would expect the Wynn Buffet to be top notch in presentation, quality, and class. Yes, I would expect their food to be good. It's just there's not a whole lot variety to pick from.
 
Sure, you get the usual cuts of meats and crab legs and some Asian favorites, but beyond that I kept wondering where that $42 is going into? By the 2nd trip, I ran out of things to eat and resorted to a slice of pizza - something I was trying to avoid eating.  I was expecting a whole lot more. Also of note, the prime rib came out very rare.  The lamb chops though - DE-licious!

I hafta admit the taste is definitely superb and the quality is tops - all fine and dandy up to the point you realize that the Bellagio can offer just about the same level goodness but provide A LOT more food options to really wring your money's worth.

Where you're really putting the money into here is what comes after the meal.  If you're totally in it for the desserts, then the Wynn Buffet is for you.  This place has probably the most impressive (and largest?) dessert bar of any buffet I've been to around town. Gelatos, tiramisu, creme brulee, cookies, cakes, bread pudding...you name it, they've got it. All very decadent to commit sinful rapture on your sweet tooth.  

And I love my dessert. But I also love my main course dishes too and would expect Mr. Wynn to provide a myriad of electic food items to satiate all my taste buds. For the money, I'd place my bets on the Bellagio or Rio.",2,1,1

First thing you should go to when you get inside is the crab legs. Asian people tend to go for the expensive food first, so you'll almost always run into a line of Asians in the seafood area. If you get there too late, better bring a book to read (or your DS if you hate reading) because you'll be waiting for a while watching the person in front of you struggle to pour butter onto his plate. 

Kobe beef, delicious. I'm obsessed with their mashed potatoes. I feel like I'm wasting money filling up on that, but it's just that good. The Wynn buffet will leave you full and satisfied. Felt like you ate too much and want to burn some calories? Luckily for you the Wynn provides loads of activities you can do before you wobble back to your hotel room.

But like everything at the Wynn, their buffet exceeded any I had ever been to. 

It did NOT feel like a buffet. Every food station was manned by a team of world-class chefs, and each station was arranged by country so a trip around the buffet as like a trip around the world. And because each station was manned by chefs, they could offer made-to-order dishes.

And the dessert room - OMG! It was like something from Food Network. Bite-size, beautifully decorated cheesecakes, black forest cake, fruit tarts, tiramisu, carrot cake, custards, puff pastries. It was a literal palace of dessert porn. Not the place I should be when dieting.

However....
It was 108 degrees when we went. So my sweet boyfriend as well as about 3 other people in line were in tank tops. When it was our turn to pay, the cashier looked at my boyfriend and said with an attitude ""you can't come in like that you have to buy a shirt."" My gripe with this is that on all the wynn's website for this place regarding dress code it only says ""casual attire"". No where was it that specific except for when you get to the buffet. We were not going to walk all the way back to our suite at the palazzo in the heat so he can change and wait in line all over again so we bought the over priced shirt (gray Hanes looking with a tiny Wynn logo on the front) from the cashier. Not cool Wynn!  I mentioned to our cashier and server that I felt like this was cheating their customers and they should at least be a bit more specific regarding dress code on their website and still just got an attitude.  I understand they aren't directly responsible for what is advertised but the attitudes were unnecessary.

We decided to have just a light lunch that day so that we could head over to the Wynn for an earlier than normal dinner to avoid the crazy disneyland-like winding lines. We got there around 5:30 and there were just a few people in line infront of us. We were seated quickly and this time around our server was top notch. She was very attentitive and quick to fill our drinks and to remove our empty plates. 

The prime rib was again juicy and perfect and they give you huge slices so you dont have to keep going back and asking for another (but of course you can if you wish). I had to mention the prime rib again because this is the place that made me LOVE and crave it, and when we went to the Bellagio Buffet the night previous and I was less than impressed with their dry and overcooked prime rib, I knew we would be heading over to the Wynn the next day to satisfy my craving. Also in comparison to the Bellagio buffet, the crab legs at the Wynn are HUGE! So much more meat and yumminess. There are tons of other choices but I will always levitate towards the prime rib and crab legs.

What makes this place so special in my heart? You have to check out the seafood section, where the Alaskan king crab legs rock my world.  These things are freaking huge, fresh, and oh my god tasty!  The crab seriously just melts in your mouth.  Dip them in butter and it's an all out orgy in your mouth.  

The dessert area is fabulous; unfortunately sometimes I have a hard time saving room.  From the yummy cr√®me brulee to the delicious ice cream\/gelato counter.  I always go for the coffee or vanilla, so good! They also have different kinds of cakes\/pies, cookies, and puddings.  They have a little of everything, whatever your sweet tooth might desire.

The staff service has been pretty impressive every time I've gone to the Wynn Buffet.  They are very good at checking with you for drink refills and also help clear up any dishes you might have laying around the table.

The only bad thing I can mention is their lackluster of sushi.  They only have 3 choices between Vegetarian rolls, California rolls, and Salmon Maki rolls.  None of them really tasted fresh and were all very bland.  The pizza is pretty blah as well, however I usually stay away from it anyways as it's just filler food and just takes up space I could use for more crab legs. :)

The prime rib was actually pretty good. I did like it.  I also liked the gelato selection at the dessert area.

The long wait and the $34.95 price are not even the bad things!  First off, most of the dining area was closed off so they were sticking everyone in one area, practically shoulder to shoulder at tiny tables. I'm convinced you have to be either rude or very tolerant to survive at buffets as people were constantly cutting in front of us as if the food was going to run out.  Many people were licking their fingers or putting the food in their mouth as they were going around filling their plates (wait until you sit down people, have manners)  The service was terrible - the server who was in charge of our drinks left and wasn't seen again until the end of our meal when I had to flag her down for more iced tea.  The crab legs were very salty and small.  Most of the food items were smothered in some kind of fattening sauce.  The desserts were a joke - there were less than 10 desserts to choose from.  There was a waffle station where you could order a waffle\/crepe with fruit and whipped cream.  I ordered one and waited 10 minutes because the man cooking them gave mine to the person who ordered after me.

I am sorry for the late email, just want to say thank you for the complimentary buffet that I have. Me and my wife went to the restaurant on 8th of June and have our dinner for the second time.
So far I am satisfied with the hot food that were served such as prime ribs and other hot food that you have over there. The only 2 things that I notice that the sushi still unbelievably ugly. I am still disappointed with the quality of the Sushi and is so far away from good. The server that serve us is mean, unlike the first time we ate there that we have amazing server person name Amber ( if i am not wrong). The server person that we had was to busy to do her staff and even took our food that we have not finished eating. No smile at all , and no communicating with us for how good over all the dinner is.

Again, I still disappointed with overall, especially with the ugly sushi that you have in the Buffet.
Bellow is the link of the best Buffet in the world, I hope you go to the youtube and play this link.

I believe the Wynn buffet can do this more better especially in the sushi side for such as an excellent hotel in Las Vegas and maybe  in The world. I will mention the exact word on Yelp. 
Thanks again for the complimentary dinner.
You have a good day.


Sincerely

Harlan Hilman


NB: This is the link of the best Buffet in the world that located in Philippine, South of Asia. The Mizuki buffet that located in Seattle is 85%  almost match with this restaurant.  The quality Wynn buffet is far away from these awesome buffets restaurant.

Over the years, I've tried 'em all, from the Rio (meh) to the MGM (ok) to the Bellagio (pricey but lots of seafood items).  I've also tried the Mirage's buffet (delicious, a close runner up) and the buffet at Paris (very good, but food preparation could be better).  But the buffet at the Wynn sets the standard.  

First, it's a bit pricey (I paid $42 for dinner on Saturday).  Lunch on weekdays is around $24, more like it.  The buffet is enormous.  Probably something like the size of a football field.  There are so many different types of food, you really don't know where to start.  Oh, and the food has been well prepared, but trained chefs who know how to create delicious meals.  I think the desserts are on par with some of the finest restaurants in town.

The price for dinner wasn't too bad, $40, especially considering that I spent more than that at regular restaurants for dinner. As I mentioned I'm not really a buffet fan but it was better than what I expected. A major plus was the bottomless cocktails, it was definitely needed lol. I also enjoyed the variety of cuisines offered. It was a good selection with lots to chose from. The mini deserts were so good and the perfect size. It gives you the opportunity to try a lot of them.

The good:
+ Quality buffet foods. High end things you wont find at other buffets.
+ Selection is massive! I mean, literally never ending selection of every single kind of food.
+ The decor and ambiance is elegant, classy and really positive. This is the Cadillac of Las Vegas buffets.
+ Service was impeccable. The servers were very attentive with cleaning plate, drink refills etc. 


The not so good:
- Really expensive. Get ready to drop almost $60 per person.
- The line is so long! Average wait time is 90 minutes. You can however, for $20 per person, skip the line and move to the front. There we waited only 20 minutes to get in.

Yes it's pricey, but it has by far the biggest and best selection of food. I've been been to buffets at Bellagio, Rio, Planet Hollywood and others and this is my favorite one by far and that's why they are getting a 5 Star from me!",20,13,17

While they're good in their own right. The Buffet at the Wynn took what I think of buffet's in general and threw that out the window.

Of all the buffets I've been in vegas, I would say this is by far the best looking one. I love how whimsical and fun it is when you walk in.  

Lunch is not bad compared to dinner but there are so many breakfast options to choose from that it does not make the pricing for the lunch option as appealing compared to dinner.  At dinner there are crab legs, cocktail shrimp and more expensive cuts of meat.  Like all other buffets they portion everything to small pieces for you not to waste.

The service is awful that I will not be returning in the future given all the other dining choices available on the strip.

Now the long story about my experience
I was here the Monday after Christmas.  Wait in line was approx 1.5 hours plus additional 25-30 mins wait to get seated.  I missed the 1pm cut off time for brunch and paid additional 10 bucks or ~$60 per person for lunch.  The quality of food was not as good as I remembered and definitely not 60 bucks worth for Monday lunch.  My mother is vegan and I do not recommend vegetarian\/vegan for this buffet.  I think Vegas buffet in general is a bad idea for any vegan\/vegetarian due to high prices and few selections. 

So, based on food along, I would have given this place a 3 star.  Now, zero\/negative star for the service due to the following experience:

1.  Rude server at taco stand.
When my brother went to the taco stand, the guy behind the glass said no more, and walked away.  5-10 mins later, he came out and start making more taco again??  My brother decided to not even try the taco due to the rudeness.
2.  Un-attentive male Waiter
The first server got us drinks when we first sat down and that was it.  He never came back to check on us until I waved him down.  When he brought my brother more soda, I asked him for another coke for me.  He said ok but never came back.  I guess he was off the shift and another female waiter showed up.
3.  Rude female waiter 
I asked the lady for the soda and she did brought me some.  Than she never come back to offer us refills.  When we were done with the meal and moving on to the dessert, we want to get coffee to go with desserts.  I waved the waiter down and here is the kicker.  She said, ""just you know, you are here for more than 2 hours.  There is a 2 hours limit. But, I will get you some coffee this time.""  The way she said it was rude and I was like WTF.   When she came back, I thank her for the coffee but  wanted to clarify that we were there only 1 hours and 50? mins.  She said, based on your receipt, it stated 1:49pm and its now 4:07.  I said, but we waited for at least 25-30 more minutes after we paid.  She said, NO, its based on the receipt and the 2 hours limit is posted outside the buffet.  At this point, my lunch experience was ruined and it may just be psychological effect that coffee and desserts tasted awful.  We decided to leave immediately at my version of 2 hours mark.  When I exited the buffet, I didn't see any signage up front about this rule.  So I asked the lady who is guarding the buffet line entrance and confirmed that 2 hours limit rule ""starts at the time we sit down.""

At this point, I can't stand this casino any more.  Our plan was to drop some cash at the slot machines after the meal but we went to Palazzo and Venetian instead. Palazzo and Venetian should thank the rude Wynn buffet staffs for the a couple hundreds dollar worth of gambling revenue.",2,2,0

The lamb steaks were quite good though, and I did like their creme brulee, and they sure did know how to keep the coffee coming.

Nothing great there. The next station with the meats is OK. My husband enjoyed the prime rib, but he's had better. And the there was a Mexican grill station that had tamales and potatoes. The seafood section was really disappointing. It had 3-4 mini options of fish... But missing the GOOD fish. Options were Mako, snapper, and salmon. For the price I would have expected quality like sea bass, Mahi- mahi etc. and it did not taste great either. Pizza station was unoriginal which every other buffet has.

-Really good gelato!!
-Price is not as expensive as other buffets especially if you go right before dinner. ;)

Cons: 
-The desserts I had, other than the gelato, were average. Didn't have the creme brulee perhaps I shall try it next time. 
-Lacked variety compared to Bacchanal.

You click on anything and his patter about how decadent his casino is continues to blather on.  In spite of that I must say, this casino backs up the talk.  It's gorgeous.  Maybe it's because the place is relatively new or just because it is named after the man who changed Las Vegas to the family friendly gambling mecca that it is today, but this place is decadent, elegant, saturated with rich colors, lush, and truly honors the man who created it.

The buffet has standard buffet fare- prime rib, lobster, pasta bar, etc.  But the place is spacious, clean, and well-lit, that you almost feel like you actually are having dinner at a french manor.  The meats are delicious and the quality so good, its almost like they honor the french tradition of cooking everything in butter.  Delicious.  

Usually at buffets I try to stay away from the dessert because most of the items come out of a can or mass produced by Jonaire.  I had a real hard time staying away at this place. I must have had 5 of the creme brulee which were freshly made right at the dessert bar, a bunch of the cream puffs, a little caramel apple, cotton candy.  Who makes cotton candy at a buffet?!?  Wynn.  That's who.  

The buffet at Wynn is definitely a favorite.  It costs a ton for dinner- usually when my family goes to any buffet, we let Dad pay up.

After twisting around the barrier and lines, we finally arrived at the front to buy our meal tickets and head on in. Oh boy was it worth the wait! 

There were four of us in our party, and were seated at a nice big table. I can't begin to tell you about the intense, endless variety of food available at this buffet. It should also be mentioned that each dish is hand created by the chefs, and all of it is unique. On the left side of the buffet, you will find gourmet soups and salads. My favorite was the Apple Pumpkin Squash-so much that I had 3 servings. They also have every kind of fish you can imagine from Salmon, to freshly caught sea bass. 

If you are looking for quality sea food, this buffet is best. Tons of long crab legs, from from the ocean are near the other side of the buffet. Also they have succulent, fresh sushi, with flavors from every assortment. 

I'm not even sure where to start here. Check out some of their speciality dishes, like wild boar or southern hen. You will be hard pressed to find that unhealthy, deep fried food which is so common at other Vegas buffets. 

The Best for Last 
Wynn has the best dessert as far as buffets go on the strip. Kick ass designer ice cream in a multitude of flavors. Also there are fabulous cakes, fruit parfaits, cookies, and pies strewn across the shelves and ready to pick. My best advice is to save up your appetite when you go to this buffet.

Veal short rib - very delicious and melty\/fatty

I feel like despite the price, ($40 for dinner) this buffet is more worth it. It's cheaper than Bacchanal ($55 for dinner) and you get the same great quality of food.

Pasta cooks(step away from the cooking stations, you might hurt yourselves) need more training.  Deserts, well let's just say "" the Creme brulee""  was very runny.  The best thing in there was the mashed potatoes, let's not even talk about the gravy...... I think you get the picture.
For $38.00 and the Wynn name,  I expected the absolute best in food, quality and service. Seems like the only guy that knew what he was doing, was the busboy......what a shame. I hope he grows up to own this place:) and fires everyone of his co-workers,  including Stevie ""King of Hype"".

By the time we got through the line and got seated, it was 11:15 and most of the breakfast food had been removed.  There were many unused tables, so no excuses for the long lines.  It is insulting to the customers to have unused tables and yet make customers wait over an hour to get seated.  

Adding to the insult, Steve Wynn now let's you pay him ten bucks to cut in front of other people in line under the guise of ""VIP line pass.""  Ridiculous.  If lines are a problem, don't charge people to cut in front of other people and make everyone else wait longer.  The solution is to tell your staff to get their act together and seat people at some of the open tables.  And if there consistently aren't enough tables, build out your restaurant.

The food is great, and that's why I have eaten here many times over the last decade when I'm in Vegas.

Before I share my love story, I have a great tip to share with all of you that will save you some money! Come here at 3:20-3:25pm!!! I know everyone complains about the buffet prices but if you come at this time, you will be greeted with 1) no line and 2) the option to pay for lunch price. A friend tipped me off and I've done this twice already. You don't even have to argue with the cashier, she'll offer it to you. You end up paying $25 for the dinner buffet instead of $45+. Now isn't that a deal??

Ok on to the food...

My first experience here was overwhelming. There were so many things to choose from! Sometimes, it doesn't help to have a small stomach with a big appetite..not at a buffet! You get full way too fast! 

I wanted the Alaskan King Crab Legs ( they serve them hot or cold!) buttered up, the shrimp, the lamb chops, the prime rib, the Lamb T-bone steak, the mussels with saffron sauce, the different cuts and types of lamb and beef and chicken, and even the salad and vegetables and soup and bread. I tried everything, there were some that I didn't like here and there but for the most part, everything was spectacular. At this point, I couldn't breathe, I literally couldn't breathe and I told my best friend I felt like throwing up because my tiny little stomach couldn't handle all of the food I had shoved down my throat. 

I had to sit there and wait...and wait...and wait until my stomach would let me eat more, because God forbid I leave the Wynn without trying their desserts! Though most of their desserts are heavenly there's one dessert I dream about: the Creme Brulee. Try it, love it, dream about it. 

I've tried other buffets but this one is the Wynner. If a buffet is going to make me want to throw up, not because the food is horrible but because I had a fat kid adventure and stuffed my face, then it's got to be good.",4,3,5

There are also a few choices of Sushi along with must try shumai and pot stickers (why are these so good? Seriously, they rival the best dumplings in Monterey Park) 

Don't miss the indian food sections- the curry sea bass was excellent. 

All of the sides are amazing as well. Mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus\/corn, harricot vert and duck salad, barley salad, all of the salads in the little cups, gazpacho... oh man I can't even remember them all. 

Yes, and the dessert area is amazing. The Brulee, Rice pudding with passion fruit\/mango and banana chocolate were my favs. 

They change the food every ten minutes and all of the food is  tiny trays so you know what they put out is the freshest it can be. Also, every portion size is PERFECT. Just enough for a few bites so you can try everything-- now that's some attention to detail.

It had been a while since I last indulged in a buffet in Vegas and decided to try this one out since we were staying in the Wynn. The wait of an hour and forty-five minutes was a bit ridiculous and I probably would have decided against it had I known what we we were in for. We started in a line across the hall where we waited before being ushered across the threshold. The snaking line past that point was deceptively long and Disneyesque. We could have paid an additional $16 to skip most of the line but it's all part of the game and I was already committed so I didn't want to give Mr. Wynn the satisfaction of taking the extra dough. I would have paid for a freaking drink had they had a bar in the line though.

Once we were finally seated the food was very good and the service was great. The have a huge variety of interesting choices already pre-plated in small serving sizes. The mini fish and chips was the most fun. While everything was good, there was nothing I felt was good enough that I needed seconds on. Trying a bit of everything is what the experience is about.

The most unique aspect of the buffet is the setting. The inside is decorated with fresh flowers under an atrium with lots of natural light. There are plenty of small side rooms so the setting feels more like a nice restaurant than a buffet.

Rumor is right.

I have to make a disclaimer first, though: I'm not a buffet fan.  In my experience, buffet food is bland, stale, and mass-produced.  Plus, I can't force-feed myself enough stuff to justify the cost.  

That said... In terms of quality and atmosphere, the Wynn buffet blows all other buffets out of the water.  No other buffet comes close.

We decided to give the Wynn buffet a try on a Monday morning.  I was surprised that there was already a line, but it moved quickly.  After paying the cashier, we were ushered through the bright and cheerful entryway to our seats.  Water and OJ appeared in front of us in no time.  

Then we wandered over to scope out the savory food...

Let's just say that the selection is... obscene.  Don't bother trying everything here; it's impossible unless you have a black hole in your stomach or something.  Be strategic with what you want to taste.  My memory is too hazy to provide an unabridged list of the deliciousness available at the Wynn buffet, so I'll begin by recalling a few highlights from the savory options:

** Pastas (delicious bowties with pesto, rigatoni, etc.)
** Fried chicken (crispy outside, juicy inside -- superb!)
** Mashed potatoes (creamy!)
** Gazpacho (fresh and tangy!)
** Bagels and lox with cream cheese and LOTS of fresh onions (my weakness)
** Vaguely Chinese-inspired stir-fries (flavorful and not greasy)
** Omelets made to order (yum!)
** Beet & orange salad (love!)
** Split pea risotto (amazing texture)
** Carnitas bowls (nicely done!)

... and my mind is blanking on the rest of the delicious savory goodies.  

There were some lowlights sprinkled in, though:

** Pizza (rubbery, grease-soaked, and inedible)
** Sushi (slimy rice-balls that are better suited for throwing at people you dislike)
** Prime rib (overcooked into oblivion)

Of course, the shining star of the Wynn buffet is the dessert room.  The sweet options here are mind-bogglingly diverse and 100% delicious:

** Gelato bar
** Marshmallow ""lollipops"" dipped in chocolate
** Keylime cheesecake
** Cr√®me br√ªl√©e
** Chocolate chunk brownies
** Strawberry tarts
** Candy apples
** Mini red velvet cupcakes
** Cookies galore

I lost count of how many plates of food I went through.  :-\/  In my defense, I only took a bite or two (or twenty) from each one.  :-)   The Wynn buffet is the (main) reason I had to hit the gym reeeeeeeeally bad when I returned home.

I went for dinner which was $38.95, but since I ate in a big party there was an 18% gratuity which brought the total close to $50. That being said, I'm a huge fan of the Rio Carnival World Buffet, but I don't think you can compare the two. 

FOOD: The selection at the Wynn is different than that of the Rio. I'd say the food at the Wynn Buffet is more ""exquisite"" so-to-speak and approaches fancier type of meals compared to the Rio. I'm the kind of guy that likes T-bone steaks and all the other stuff you'd expect to find at a buffet. The only food I really liked was the salmon salad which I thought was the best. The Alaskan crab legs were also pretty good so if you like crab legs then you definitely have to consider this. The prime rib they gave me was REALLY rare, and I'm not a fan of eating rare meat at all. I'll only eat medium-rare at best. The Dim sum was alright, but I've had better, but if you pay $50 to have all-you-can-eat Dim sum at a buffet, something is wrong with you. The whole time I just wondered, where's the steak at???? If you like lamb, then you should try this place, they give you lamb racks and lamb chops. I'm not fond of lamb so I passed on that. But, where were the pork\/beef ribs though???? I looked all over the place and no where to be found...

FRUIT: After hearty meals at a buffet I always look for fruit to balance out the junk I've eaten. To my dismay, they really didn't have a fruit bar or selection fruit for that matter. The only fruit I really saw was cantaloupe, honey dew, and some other fruit. There were also fruits reserved for the crepes which were pretty good as well. 

DESERT: The Wynn shines with this aspect of their buffet. They have about 5 or 6 kinds of ice cream flavors and you can put a bunch of toppings on it similar to what you can do at a yogurt place (put oreos, sprinkles, coconut, etc.). Try the strawberry sorbet, you'll love it! They also have a chef make you crepes or waffles. Weren't the best crepes I've had, but A-OK none-the-less. A bunch of cookies and cakes are also here too.

Bottom line, maybe it's just me or maybe it's the Wynn buffet, but I felt like it wasn't money well-spent. I'm not hating on the Wynn or anything but like I said earlier, I'm just not the type of guy who's fancy smancy when it comes to meals. I like simple things that make me full and the Wynn didn't have it for me. But if you're a big fan of the Rio Buffet like I am, then I don't think you'll like this spot.",1,0,0

so hot!

Anyway, I did not even match Faffy's 3 hours at the Wynn Buffet...unless you count the time spent waiting in line.

Overall it was a very good buffet experience.  All jokes aside the wait was really not that long, even more amazing when you take into consideration that they had to accommodate a group of 22!

The selection was not mind blowing but many of the options that they did have were quality.  The carving station was particularly impressive.  The kalbi marinated strip steak was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The prime rib was very similarly cooked.  I didn't have any rack of lamb but it looked really good.  I liked the mashed potatoes a lot, a must have for any potato lover.  I would have liked to have seen scalloped potatoes though.

I passed on most of the seafood options and just piled a few crab leg halves on my plate.  They split all the crab legs so you don't have to fight to get at the meat.  I guess this is a nice thing to do but I kind of like taking the crab legs apart and removing the leg meat whole.  I like butter station a lot.  It really is perfectly clarified too, as you could tell by the cup of butter that I had sitting with me during my meal that did not congeal one bit at room temperature.

The desserts that I sampled were really good.  The cheesecake was tasty and came in a small portion which helps for people that don't want to overdo dessert.  There was one person in my group that fell in love with the bread pudding.  The candy apples looked dangerous to eat but I heard were tasty.  The cookies were crispy without being hard or dry.

I believe that If I get one more shot at taking on The Buffet at the Wynn and really focus my attention to just the task at hand with no other people or events to take into consideration I can at the very least match a 3 hour session.",12,8,8

We were staying here so we decided to check it out on Friday night - our last night here. 

We were both very hungry, we hadn't eaten much all day, my GF actualy hadn't eaten at all, due to being hung over from the night before when we were at Tao and had never ending Grey Goose Vodka.

It was around 930 and the line up was pretty long. We saw a second line that was empty - it was for Red Card . Staying at the hotel, we both had Red Cards - good for both casino play and room key. We waltz right up. We were told we had to go to the Red CardClub desk to get some voucher to use to skip the line.

We go to the Casino. We ask how many points we need.... 300 to skip the line. 
Whoops we didn't have 10 between the both of us ! Hehehe 

Back in the line we go ! 

We wait, we pay. 39.99 each plus tax plus they ask how much of a tip we wish to pay. WTF ?  At a buffet ??  Hmm we add to the total .

Finally we get seated. 

A waiter comes over to take drink orders. Bottomles juice or pop. Alcohol is available, but not included in the price.

The buffet itself is HUGE ! We hit the seafood. Shrimp Cocktail & Pre cracked crab - Hello ! 

I won't go into lots of details as most reviews list the food choices. However, I must mention the charcuterie station - meats, cheeses, pickles, breads, hummus, olive dip. Yum!  

We filled up on this and an assortment of other delights. 

Dessert was amazing ! An entire room devoted to this ! Gellato cases, for those wanting a frozen treat. Creme br√ªl√©e, Candy Apples ! So much more - but those were my personal indulges! 

If you get a chance - go. But go hungry !!",2,1,1

The main areas are nice and can accommodate large amounts of people.  Everything else looked nice too.

There were a good amount of dinner items to choose from and everything always looked fresh.  Most items tasted good and others not so much.

Upon entering, There is a beautiful bright atrium dining area with colorful flowers. The main dining room is very pleasant and elegant. The arched ceiling lets natural light in for a bright airy feel, makes for a relaxing atmosphere.

There is so much food to choose from. It took me 10 minutes to walk the buffet to scope out what I wanted to eat. There was fresh salad, soup, vegetables. sushi, shrimp, prime rib, beef brisket and much more. Then, there it was....beautiful Alaskan crab legs!  Already pre-sliced lengthwise so cracking isn't necessary, just use your fork and pull the meat out. Yeah, Vegas baby!

You have to make room for dessert. There's a room of luscious, scrumptious delights. Wonderful creme brulee, cakes, tiramisu, assorted tarts and more, all served in small (bite size) portions. That way you can try a few different ones. My wife is always on the hunt for real cream puffs, she found them here.There's also a crepe station and red candied apples on a stick.

He served us our drinks and barely came back after that. To keep it simple, I will provide a few bullets to sum up our 2.5 hour buffet experience:

- Seafood section was mediocre and may be smaller than the ones I have seen in Minnesota. There were crab legs, cocktail shrimps, and that was pretty much it. No oysters, clams, mussels, etc. This was a Friday night too

- The pork belly dishes were not so glamorous (besides the Chinese pork buns). It tasted bland and I had to spit out one of the dishes since the sauce did not align to the meat

- The rib-eye \/ steaks were decent and comparable to other buffets. Where are the lamb chops?

- Where is the fruit section? Like some cut apples or something? I know it is a fancy-style buffet, but I have seen it at others 

- Dessert selection is strong. I recommend the mango and lychee flavors with cone

It was the first time in Vegas for my wife and kids so we wanted to have dinner at a very nice buffet.  So, we chose the Wynn Buffet.  Wow!!!  I don't know how this place stays in business.  Of all the buffets I've been to in my life, this place is hands down the worst place as far as value for the money.  

I was really looking forward to eating some seafood at the buffet such as oysters on the half shell and Alaskan King Crab legs.  Again... Wow!!!  The oyster they set out were not oysters.  They were oyster shells.  They had no oysters on them!  How is this possible?  I have never had oysters at any restaurant that served just the shells.  As I'm writing this review... I still can't believe it.  And the King Crab legs??? They were frozen and sliced in half.  They were very small with very little meat on them.  Well... at least there was some meat on them to eat as opposed to the oysters.  

So, after that fiasco, I decided to try their prime rib.  I stood there in amazement watching the guy struggling to carve a slice of the prime rib.  He was actually struggling to cut through the meat!!!  Really???  I tried eating the prime rib but had to stop after a few bites because it was just too tough to chew.

In any case, I've tried Wynn's buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant is pretty, and tables are spaced nicely apart. Service is friendly; coffee and drinks arrive promptly. There's a wide variety of food at all meals.

What I've tried has generally been decent. For breakfast, that included: a muffin; some sort of smoked fish; two Chinese dishes that I had never heard of before (one with beef, the other I forget); a type of link sausage. The omelet station looked good, there were a lot of fruit and pastries available, as well as Mexican dishes.

For lunch, I did a better job of taking notes. I had:
*  Prime rib. This was not the traditional whole prime rib, cut into rare pieces by a carver. It was already carved slices of meat, apparently cooked after being sliced. That being said, it was a hit: slightly pink, with a little crispy fat, tender, flavorful. Rating: very good+.
*  Jerk chicken. Truly spicy, and not overcooked. Very good.
*  Kobe meatballs. Slightly spicy, good texture. Good to very good.
*  Smoked sturgeon. Good.
*  Tempura rock shrimp. Good to very good.
*  Salmon and scallop ceviche. Ok flavor and texture, but nothing special. Good.
*  Red snapper. Juicy, good flavor; not overcooked. Very good.
*  Roll. Average.
Desserts:
*  Madelaine. Fair.
*  Lemon curd tart. Good. Would have been very good, but the lemon flavor was not sour\/intense enough.
*  Creme brulee. Surprisingly, the sugar was properly caramelized and crackly. However, the cream was too soft. Good to very good.
*  Chocolate mousse with brownie pieces and walnuts. The mousse was not too sweet, with a rich, dark chocolate flavor. The brownie chunks and walnuts were a good addition. Very good.
*  Peanut butter cookie with candied peanuts. Good.

For dinner, I was too lazy to bother taking notes. There was a wide variety of foods; quality was on a par with lunch.

My conclusion? The Wynn buffet is pretty good. In fact, it's better than he other buffets I've tried. For all I know, it's the best, but it's still a buffet. The food is decent but not outstanding, so why bother?",1,0,0

However, I'm not sure why they are known for them, because most of them are awful. But... The buffet at the Wynn is actually really good. The decor is beautiful, as is everything at the Wynn. It's a really nice place, not how I normally think of a buffet. They have a little bit of everything and offer an all you can drink pass (I think it's like 16 dollars or something) [[There is also an express entry line, it costs quite a bit more, but I think it's worth it to avoid the line]]  The all you can drink pass includes champagne, mimosas, I think bloody marys and beer and wine maybe. Its a pretty good deal. Of course if you're having a non alcoholic beverage its included in the price of the buffet. They also offer additional alcoholic beverages that you can pay for separately. 

It's by far the cleanest, best kept, and best value buffet on the strip.",1,0,0

The surroundings are beautiful, prettier than the Bellagio or Ceasars buffet by far. The wait wasn't long to get in but that's where the prompt service ended. The waitress was very friendly and apologetic but they were understaffed and she couldn't keep up. They took a while to clear plates and very slow to bring drinks. We did the endless champagne brunch and it was a total waste of money since the waitress only brought 2 over.

Lots of choices, a little something for everyone. Some of the food was excellent: pancakes, country potatoes with lobster, sausage from the carving station, lox and definitely more but I can't remember all of it. But there was also huge disappointments: anything in the Asian or dessert section was inedible. The desserts all seemed like they had been previously frozen and left with terrible textures. And unfortunately I think I'm spoiled with Dim-sum at home but it was definitely a miss too.

Looking for snow crab leg and rack of lamb ? Wait til dinner time. They only have cocktail shrimp during brunch. No lamb. The dessert however was fantastic. Nice selection and all very tasty. 

The wine selection was a joke. The price charged for a glass of wine is exactly the market price for a bottle. Beer go for about $6-7.5 a bottle. Yes, you can buy a six pack  for the price of one beer. Don't want to get ripped off ? Don't drink alcoholic beverage.

In my opinion, compared to a year ago, there were a few more ""misses"" with dishes than before.  Since it's a buffet, if the salmon is dry, you just don't eat it, but it was still disappointing as I am used to loving everything on my plate.  The best things are the cold large shrimp (peeled) and crab legs (cut open lengthwise).  Note that these two items were NOT available at lunch time, only at dinner ... and there is a large price difference.  The prime rib was also only available at dinner.  I think the shrimp used to be offered at lunch and it SHOULD be available at lunch time, so felt a little gyped at that time of day.  I like that there are items that are unusual but still approachable enough that even the fainter of heart might try it ... tequila watermelon salad, venison meatloaf, kale and jicama salad with blue cheese and grapes, ham and broken egg pizza, hot salami,  and so forth.  There are enough options to go more than once and still have many new and interesting things to sample.  You MUST save room for dessert.  Trust me on this.  This is one of the few buffets where the desserts are as good as they look and the sugar on the creme brulle is still solid.  They have some interesting choices here too, like candy apples and mini cupcakes.  If you are picky about your calorie intake, then I suggest the buffet at Luxor which is second in horribleness only to the Sahara (which is now demolished).",1,0,1

First off, it is expensive. Went Friday for lunch and it was $56 for 2. This did not include liquor nor basics like espresso or cappuccino. They did have a number of juices, even though it took some prodding from the server (pineapple juice!). 

The main dishes shine brighter here than many buffets that you can ever try, but I can definitely see some general areas of improvement. My preferred selections included:
Angus Sliders w\/ Cheese
Ravioli
Fried Clams
Sweet Corn Tamale
Pepperoni Pizza
Sausages 
Sea Salt and Vanilla Gelato

NOT GOOD *nope not at all*: Macaroni and cheese (so deceptive too), tri-tip, confetti cupcake, madelines, and rice krispie pops.

pay for lunch price around 3, get seated and get your waiter to get you some coffee or something, so you can kill time for the roast beef  to come out from the grill. if you just go ahead and eat all the other stuff, you aren't getting your money's worth! forget pasta or bread! you can eat all that at home! make sure you get a nice thick slice from the nice man once its your turn, and pour over plenty of sauce! don't be shy, you won't regret it.
the crab legs at the seafood section is awesome too. they are huge with lots of meat inside, and they're already split down the middle so you don't need to struggle getting them out. the flavor is sweet, fresh, and so satisfying!!

We only came here for lunch so most of the cooking stations were not open, the ones that I noticed  but were closed were a noodle station and a crepe station.  Food quality was very good here, the only thing that didn't look fresh to me was a couple of fish dishes and fish almost never looks fresh.  Our favorite dishes were the Korean Short Ribs, Pork loin, super sweet corn on the cob and sweet corn chowder.  The lychee ice cream was also a hit for me with real pieces of lychee in the yummy ice cream.

You've seen me, that one chick with an empty plate circling the grounds over and over again like a bratty 7 year old who only wants to eat pizza but all there is to choose from is fish and chow mien. Yeah, that's me frowning at the seafood and ""asian"" selection, unsure of what type of food I'm in the mood for. 

I'm the most indecisive person and with a stomach simply not made for buffets, accepted the fact that I could never happily eat a meal at a buffet. That is, until I went to the Wynn. I was skeptic at first, but with friends and family that die for buffets and with all the great reviews I had to swallow my pride and brave the never ending feat I've had with buffets. Thank God I did because it was the best buffet experience I've had in my life.

Totally worth the wait, which can be about 30-45 minutes long depending on what time you get there. I suggest going right when it opens or eating at odder hours of the day, like 3-5 so the lunch crowd is just dissipating and you beat the dinner crowd.

Food at all times of the day are good. Their breakfast selection is pretty standard but I've never had a better french toast from a buffet. I loved their selection, with most options looking healthier than the average vegas buffet - you have to try their cold salads\/veggies. Lots of vegan options as well that barely taste vegan. The risotto is perfect and has a nice sweetness to it, probably my favorite dish here. 

If you're here for the crab, they don't serve them until dinner time. Probably the least messy you'll get when eating crab legs since they're finely cut for you, not to mention they are delicious. Their pho is also surprisingly good enough to finish an entire small bowl.

The desserts are fantastic and very artisan like, but not all taste that great. Mostly just for presentation but I do recommend the cupcakes, gelato, and bread pudding which is divine. Their candied apple is the exact recipe for a broken tooth, even if the apple inside the rock hard shell is very fresh and crisp. Avoid.

The Wynn knows EXACTLY how to win my heart over with their delicious strawberries and their own little side room of desserts and ice cream.  Not to mention, they have the one thing i MUST drink in the mornings when in Vegas- mimosas!  They are super generous with the champagne to orange juice proportion.  So you can get a super nice buzz when walking out of the buffet!

Can I start with how much of a crush I have on the Wynn dessert room?  They have ice creams in so many different flavors and various toppings.  They have little plates of cakes, mousses, brownies, cookies and my favorite- TIRAMISU!  I could eaten those all day long!

If you come here, you MUST try the following:
1.  Their strawberries are to die for!  So yummy with the cream that they have on the side.  I love eating it with the brown sugar and whipped cream.  
2.  Their Caesar salad was delicious!  I love the cheese and dressing.
3.  Visit the omelet station!  I mean it! Don't skip out on it!  It is so delicious!
4.  Get their mimosas!  It will make you feeling nice for the rest of the morning.

Food: 2\/5
I came here with really high expectations, based on the reviews of this place, but sadly, my hopes were dashed upon tasting their food.

Prime Rib: 2\/5 (First slice: Well done and dry; 2 slice medium)
Veal: 4\/5 (best dish of the entire buffet)
Sushi: 0\/5 (Spicy Salmon roll, fishy and nori wrap was wilted)
Poke Tuna: 3\/5 (OK)
Crab legs: 2\/5 (Not much taste if you eat without the butter.)
Gelato: 4\/5 (Creamy and smooth, best of the desserts)

Everything looked old, food quality is comparable to Hometown Buffet.  No oysters, and sushi selection was lacking. Quality of food was sub-par. Workers really seemed unhappy and apathetic.

Service: 3\/5
Average service. Plates could have been removed more quickly, and waiter rarely came to check up on us or refill our drinks.

Ambiance: 3\/5
Outdated compared to the other high-end buffet places.

Surprisingly it wasn't packed at all! If you were @ the Bellagio, there's a line almost all the time. We chose to go around 3 just before dinner starts because it's $7 cheaper. It's $39 for dinner btw.Their selections are pretty much the same like the Bellagio (Italian, Pizza, Salads, Shellfish, Desserts, Crepes, Prime Rib, etc etc). Unfortunately, I didn't get to try everything! There was so much to try and we got full after an hr.

We started off with salads and I love it. I don't know what kind of dressing they use but it was good. Yes, I paid $32 for some delicious salads!! Got a full plate of king crab legs because that's pretty much all you go to the buffet for? The line is always long for this so make sure to grab something on your plate and eat while waiting. I think it tastes better hot than cold so just ask them to grill it up for you. I didn't try their salmon & chicken but I heard it's not bad! 

Since I tried Wynn Buffet from many years ago, I really didn't pay attention about the sushi at that time. Unfortunately, they only have 3 rolls for the sushi selection. Booo-hoo! This is why I preferred the Bellagio better because they do have sushi even though their rice sucks! I just eat it without the rice = sashimi! 

Their desserts selection is soo cute! Everything is tiny so you get to try a lot of stuffs. I don't remember if Bellagio is the same or not. I tried a whole bunch and one of them was my favorite. Too bad I didn't check the name for it. It is in a little long cup!",0,0,0

The rest of this review is a non-exhaustive list of problems with their food.

Crab legs - These were frozen hard and flavorless. They tasted like rubber.

peking duck buns - A fist-sized bun with 2 thin slices of duck. You can't even taste the duck. Not to mention it's not even peking duck.

Prime rib - Overcooked. I know they probably do this because some people like their steak welldone but these people shouldn't be eating steak in the first place.

Lamb - Also overcooked.

Sushi - There were literally 4 types of rolls with no nigiri. The rolls weren't good.",5,1,0

For whatever reason, I love to try new buffets and try different dishes that I would never order off the menu. It's like a fun adventure for me.

The Wynn Buffet is top notch! The wait wasn't that bad, pretty standard at about half an hour. $40 per person is a little steep, but hey! You're in Vegas so expect to shell out some cash. Walking in you will see a whole bunch of colorful flowers, it's a very feminine atmosphere.

Our server was very friendly and helpful, she always checked in with us and removed any plates and refilled our drinks the moment it gets half way, excellent service!

Whenever I go to a new buffet, I always walk around and check out the food selection before I even grab a plate, and that's because I want to keep a mental note of the items I really want to eat, versus the I'm not sure but I'll try it cause it's there kind of dish.

I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the buffet line, it was almost spotless, the food looked beautiful, almost too beautiful to eat. The presentation was classy and made everything looked delicious. By the time I sat back down at the table, I had the following on my plate: prime rib, king crab legs, red snapper, chilean sea bass, shrimp cocktail, mussels, skirt steak, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, asparagus. All very good, they had a lot of seafood choices and a lot of lamb, which I didn't have any cause I wasn't feeling it that day, but I'm sure it was good.

By this time I've opened the portal to my second stomach and I'm ready to hit the dessert bar. I have 2 words for you: creme brule Oh Sweet Jesus it was good! I could have eaten at least 2 more plates of it, but I had to leave room for... I have another 2 words for you: homemade ice cream, OK that's 3 words whatever, there's nothing I love more than ice cream, unless it's HOMEMADE ice cream. So rich and creamy, the coffee ice cream will give you chest hair, but it's worth it lol

I'd like to add that they have restrooms just for the buffet guests, you don't have to walk outside to the casino and find a restroom, very convenient. Also, the stalls are very private, it's like you're in your own little world in there, you don't see that very often in public restrooms.

This is not one of those places where you pile as many peel and eat shrimps on your place, while you madly pile drive past hungry sharp elbowed grandmas who are horning in on the freshly cooked oysters, meanwhile you're blithely ignoring the nasty look the staff is giving you as you try to balance three plates at once.

No, this is a place you go and get a little bit gussied up.  You're entering some strange Miyazaki buffet wonderland styled by Gourmet Magazine.  You are still surrounded by tourists, but you are all equally awed by the presentation & effort put forth at the buffet tables.  

I spent a lot of time looking around for discounts, and figured that that any discounts came with a lot of effort, so just suck it up and pay full price for it.  I recommend coming for lunch, which will make it $25 ish per person.  Yowsa, right?  But then again, this is high end food, in a high end casino, in high end Las Vegas.  You are going to hand your wallet over to the nice cashier & smile pretty when she thanks you.

Everything I tried was at the very least quite tasty, if not amazing.  And I give kudos for the dessert area.  Most buffets I ignore everything but soft serve.  Crappy ice cream, but there is a something about it....I digress, I am a food snob when it comes to dessert.  I from the SF Bay Area, we know ALL about dessert.  A little pretty presentation will not disguise ineptitude.  But I got none of that here, all the desserts tried were tasty!

Big plus, Steve Wynn, a recently converted vegan, went on campaign to veganize all his properties.  As a result, every food place has a lot more vegan options (if not an entire separate vegan menu that you can request).  At every buffet station there were posted discrete notices reminding you that you are always free to ask the staff to accommodate any food change requests (although presumably in moderation).  I removed 1 star only because the omelet staff person convinced my vegan that egg beaters were vegan.  So, you vegans out there be sure to double check your food if you don't want to be bummed!

Favorites:
1. pea truffle oil risotto - creamy & delicious & truffly.
2. creme brulee - this was a dinner dessert.  VERY rich, but small portions so not overwhelming.
3. cold seafood: squid ceviche, cocktail shrimp, smoked salmon, creamed herring
4. pastas both in seafood & italian sections
5. slices of flank steak - not dry, quite flavorful, cooked medium rare.

The less goods:
- big chunks of fish in general I thought were kinda dry and not terribly flavorful
- cup of thai beef salad was weird and definitely not thai and just vinegary & weird.
- Indian food at dinner: not as flavorful as Indian food in an indian restaurant

The environment when you walk in is something to see. Flowers hanging from baskets, primly dressed hostesses, and a line to get in that looks like you are waiting for a roller coaster. 

The eating area is not so spectacular. Plain, is how I would describe it. Almost Denny's like. But comfortable.

it's mashed potatoes.

And The Buffet @ Wynn? THEY DO THEIR MASHED POTATOES RIGHT.

If you need some convincing whether ~$60 FOR DINNER is worth it (automatically got charged 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more, fuuu) I got THREE WORDS FOR YOU: TRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES

BEST MASHED POTATOES ON THE STRIP...MAYBE EVEN MY WHOLE LIFE? No, I'm not still ""on another level"" from my Fat Tuesday...this is serious! Flawlessly creamy...fans of potato lumps beware because there are none found in this pot of heaven. Decadent. This is the jackpot that will compensate for what you lost at the poker table. 

But as for everything else, truth isssssssss I'd say... iiiiiiit's mediocre. 

Things I can recall...
OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER - dry like the oyster never saw the ocean. Try one for yourself to see if you're luckier than I was.
SEA BASS - creamy, tender, flaky, yum
TACOS - did not taste authentic at all. 
TAMALES - no meat but surprisingly good! 
ASIAN BRAISED PORK BELLY - ooooooh baby this was good. It was mixed in a stir fry with green beans.
THE DUMPLINGS - decent
SUSHI - did not look appealing to me
CARVING STATION - miso rubbed steak was good; a smidge dry. Prime rib was forgettable. Turkey looked like it's been sitting at Encore Beach Club since last Thanksgiving (and I'm typing this 6\/30\/16...)
DESSERT - custom crepes and the wheel of life - i mean, the bountiful selection of ice creams (you'll see what I mean once you're there) - was nice. Other than that, all the desserts I tried were meh\/10.
VEGAN FRIENDLY - highlight of our meal was seeing our two vegan friends feast at this buffet with glee! Pbbbbt, when would you ever see those words in the same sentence - ""vegan"", ""glee"", ""buffet""? I KNOW! They truly do cater to vegetarians\/vegans here by giving them a personal tour of the food selection to show what's compatible with their diet (even desserts!), and the chefs made them a personal VEGAN PIZZA! WOW. totez cool.

3.5\/5 OVERALL - i'd definitely come back here if I returned with my vegan friends, but if I'm in Sin City to sin via overdosing on copious amounts of food, I'll take my money elsewhere. Like others have hinted in their reviews, there is a lack of quality and innovation at this buffet that doesn't match the prestige reputation of the hotel. You won't be leaving here thinking ""That meal was epic and worth my $$$!"" like you would after Bacchanal, but it's worth a try.

P.S. - don't be fooled by the waitress saying they have ""fresh lemonade"", unless by ""fresh"" they mean ""freshly added water to some powder mix"" - SKIIIIIIP",1,5,0

HIGH SPEED SUMMARY OF DIANE P's REVIEW:
The seafood's marginal... the sushi's abominable... the carving station's great... the pizza was sketchy and the miso soup tragic... although I found the desserts to be pretty good as they go in Vegas, even compared to Le Village @ Paris, contrary to what she states.

THE RULE OF VEGAS BUFFETS:
Now with that out of the way, here's the thing you gotta remember:
As buffet's go, this is probably one of the BEST in Vegas.  No, seriously.  And that's because most buffets in Vegas - even those from the Wynn & Bellagio... SUCK.

There's only 2 reasons I personally go to a buffet in Vegas:
1) COMPED:  The casino comped the buffet & a line pass for me. 
And in this case, Wynn's Red Card is EASY to get buffet comps with.  Chat them up, tip the dealers, and pit bosses are at liberty to offer up line passes.
2) STERLING:  The buffet is the Sterling Brunch at Bally's.
And as such is worthy of your reservation, your wallet, and your respect, dammit.

(Sidenote:  Interesting that comp-ed meals are rung up as a $28 charge each against casino marketing.  Normal customer cash rates are $43\/person.  A 54% margin?  You bastards.)

NOT BAD FOR A LOW-STRESS MEAL:
Being that this ain't the Sterling Brunch, you can bet my visits were comped with a line pass.  And if you don't have to wait in line, and you don't have to pay the $45ish per person charge, this ain't half bad for a brunch or dinner meal, especially if you've just taken it in the pants at the blackjack pits, despite the Wynn's friendly rules.  

(INSIDER'S HINT:  Wynn's Blackjack pits accept early surrender on both their double deck as well as their 6 deck.  Early Surrender?  On the strip?  WTF?)

OTHER REASONS TO VISIT:
So what does this all mean?  Well, you've seen my reasons for eating here.  I can think of a few others:
3) FAMILIES:  As much as they don't belong at the Wynn, if you've brought your kids along, I can't imagine you bringing them into 'Alex' or 'The Country Club'.  You're probably better off at the Buffet.  They can get hot dogs, pizza, and ""California Roll"" there - all-you-can-eat at a flat rate for growing kids.  Yay!
4) STARVING:  You've been grinding nonstop in the Wynn poker room and haven't eaten in 72 hours.  People are starting to look like meatsicles.  The buffet is easy to get to in order to eat & wind down before your next sit-and-go.  I've heard the Poker Room manager can line pass you if you've clocked in enough time.

Here's a hint for those of you that frequent buffets:  
If you wanna know what food is probably gonna be decent, look behind the counter and do some quick profiling:  The Wynn buffet staff is heavy on people of a latin persuasion.  Big surprise: The homemade guacamole, fresh fried tortilla chips, salsa verde, and the cheese enchiladas are delicious & my 4 favorite items there.

CONCLUSION:
Buffets are totally situational.  You either like them or you don't.  You either eat like a pig or you eat daintily.  You either like flat rate meals or you prefer $250\/person dinners at Guy Savoy. [shakes head]  

It's a buffet.  2 1\/2-stars.  But it's one of the best buffets!  3 1\/2-stars.  Split the difference:

3-stars.

----------------
ON GETTING FREE BUFFET PASSES:
Wynn's comp plan, ""Red Card"" give you a free pair of buffet passes after just 150 points.  This is the equivalent of passing $450 through the slots, which is very easy to do in under 7 minutes on a simple $100 bill given Wynn's high return slots which are probably 99.x%, meaning you're not likely going to lose that $100.  Next pair is a 500 points which may take 20 minutes or so.  Either way, if you & a significant other play, getting free buffet comps is like shooting fish in a barrel at the Wynn.",14,8,7

We figured by the time we get to the front of the line, it'll be lunch time.  The line slowly moved, but we eventually got to the front of the line.  Lunch was $24.95.  Or something like that.

The central dining area is brightly lit by a huge skylight and the faux fantasy forest provided a stepping stone for the imagination.

Typical buffet set up with various stations offering a variety of dishes and cuisines.  The prime rib was good, as was their fried rice, leg of lamb, the gyozas were decent.  The had other items such as pizzas and pastas, sushi, other Asian dishes, a salad bar, and a few other things.

I would have to say the star was the dessert station.  They had at least 12 different desserts, all in small, 2-3 bite servings but they all looked so delicious I wish I could've had them all!  Oh, they also had gelato, with as many toppings and syrups as you want.  I didn't get any gelato but I had a bite of my friend's coffee gelato and it was REALLY strong.  The only thing that irked was one of the ladies didn't know who the executive pastry chef of the hotel was when I asked her.  I later had to google it, finding out that is it none other than the awesome Frederic Robert.

Our server could've been a lot better.  She wasn't around much and we constantly had to flag her down for refills on our beverages.  One of the busboys was doing a better job than she was.

I have searched at other places with Yorkshire pudding but that search is in vain. Every other Yorkshire pudding I've had has been disgustingly dry and burnt. I look forward to going to Vegas again just to pay $35 for those little soft rolls of delight.

Yes, we had to wait 2 hours to get in...but this was the first time I have ever waited even a few minutes...to see people complain about the buffet lines during the winter vacation makes me think that they are also the same people that grumble that there are so many people at the mall the day after thanksgiving.  Certain things are a fact of life, and if you want something great exactly when you want it, there's always a price to pay.

The food here is excellent, and though I don't go around trying to eat everything, here's what i've found to be top notch each time i have been there:

1) King Crab Legs.  If you go for any other reason, you are missing the whole point.  Yes there is a short line for the crab...please refer to above for a redundant explanation.

2) Veal Short Ribs.  Not gamey at all, cooked to perfection on the bone to maximize the taste...and yes, it's okay to eat the fat with it...yum!

3) Baked\/Poached\/Grilled\/Seared Seafood selection.  This time it was seabass and salmon...last time it was halibut...small portion sizes for the fish make it a great hot compliment to the crab legs.

4) Dessert.  If you don't save room for the desserts, you have managed to miss the second most important point of the buffet.  From fruit tart-ish treats, to creme brulee, to oreo cake, to crepes, to grasshopper pie, to pretty much whatever you want.  It's there...trust me...it's there.

It was rather pricey at $38 per person plus tax and tip. We were so tired from the drive that I guess we didn't have the energy to really enjoy the food there. Here are just a few of the dishes\/desserts I did enjoy that stood out.

-Surprisingly, their veggie pizza was thin and crisp, not oily at all. I may have appealed to me more since it was fresh out of the oven

-loved the assortment of cheeses, breads and crackers they had.

-I mostly stuck with the king crab legs. I enjoyed the fact that they were already cut in half, making them easier to eat. I only wish they were kept warm as I didn't enjoy them cold as much.

-The pastas and soups were average, except the clam chowder wasn't too bad.

-I didn't enjoy the fancy plated little salads they made or any of the meats. I was too tired to even try any of the meats but hubby did and said he wasn't impressed.

-The smoked salmon bar was great as was the Chinese food station, where you got to pick your own ingredients, which were prepared fresh in front of you.

-Desserts were abundant, however, only mediocre in taste (with the exception of their little passionate fruit and coconut dessert with tapioca, that was interesting. I also enjoyed the cheese cake and strawberry shortcake. I was disappointed that there was no Tiramisu that day.

-The crepe station which got so much fuss, was not even half as good as Sophie's crepes in SF or as good as actual European style crepes. Besides the bananas the other fruit looked preserved or gelatinous. The ice cream selections didn't seem to entice me much, although the strawberry sorbet was very good.

Overall, they have a rather large selection of food  and plenty of desserts. Some dishes as others mentioned may be hit or miss, depending how long they've been out. The sauteed fishes were also good as I forgot to mention earlier. 

Unfortunately, we had just driven in 100 degree heat for over 5 hrs from LA (not counting the drive from SF) and the exhaustion made it hard for me to focus on the food or fill up as much as I had wanted to to. They do include all sodas and ice teas free. I stuck to the unsweetened one and it was brewed nice and strong.

My first time to the Wynn buffet, and it was extraordinary. We waited about thirty minutes and were seated in the atrium in the buffet, It's probably the nicest area in the entire place and I'm quite surprised we got such a prime seat. 

Sunday brunch was pretty expensive but ultimately, you get what you pay for. The desserts, quite simply, make you drool because there are so many varieties and they're quite pretty. Someone will hand scoop gelato for you if you so desire. Everything is beautiful and arranged perfectly. 

You'll find a delicious array of delicacies like smoked salmon pizza, an antipasto platter, muesli, a cranberry\/cheese ravioli, and thickly sliced cuts of meat like turkey, roast beef, bacon, and ham.

The prime rib should be the showstopper for most buffets, but The Buffet got it all wrong.

I asked the cashier what's the main difference between lunch and dinner and she said essentially the seafood.  For dinner they have crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  They also switched in some lamb, baby veel and roast beef.  Everything else remained relatively the same.

The good: smoked salon, pulled-pork on corn bread, freshly made crepes (but not very good), good selection of desserts, korean bbq glazed kobe beef are among the few that i enjoyed. 
The bad: laking in the sushi department for sure.  Nothing like unagi (eel), sashimi (raw fish), hand rolls or anything like that.  It was also a lot smaller than some other ones, so obviously the variety is a lot smaller.  There was only one main cutting station for meat, and one on the side that served a fish dish).

There are 2 stalls in the men's bathroom. During prime time, that can be quite a wait. It is also hot in there. Ventilation please?

The service isn't amazing. I had to ask multiple times for a straw for my drink and for a refill.

They could use a little more variety in their vegetables and maybe some avocado or something with the eggs. The omelet line was quite long, and if they took an omelet order that would help significantly.

Desserts, amazing. Seafood, amazing. Ambiance, beautiful and private feeling and airy. I liked the corn tostada things they had with some sour cream and side ingredients.

We showed up Monday morning at 8 am for breakfast. There was a pretty extensive line even though it had just opened but this was mainly due to the time it took for the servers to take payment and escort each group in. We weren't waiting long before we were brought to our seats.

I passed on the endless mimosas this time around since I'd actually had a bit of a delicate morning (boooo) but I made up for it with amazing food. There's standard breakfast fare, including freshly made omelets and pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, and a bunch of other things I can barely remember. Then there's a whole other level of food: pizza, Asian, Mexican, a fresh slab of meat. I can't even remember what else was there. Then there's desserts: an ice cream bar, assorted bars and cake slices, cookies. 

I ate so much, but fortunately didn't make myself sick (unlike the last buffet I attended!)  Servers were quick to clear off our dirty dishes, although on one clearing they swiped the silverware. 

Since you pay before you get in, once you're done with your food, you can just up and leave. It's actually a pretty sweet arrangement.

5* for selection & quality of ingredients used

I've been to the buffet at the Wynn three times - mostly because we were staying either at the Wynn\/Encore and it was convenient.

There's so much decent to good food to choose from... I won't lie, not everything is delicious - and they often do change things around a bit. (That delicious Baileys Panna Cotta isn't always there...) However, they deserve a fourth star since there is ALWAYS a huge selection - fresh seafood, random sushi, 1-2 dim sum, red meats, pastas, etc. (If you know what gnocchi's supposed to taste like, steer clear of theirs.) I know what I like of the seafood, but as for the rest, I usually try a tablespoon-sized portion of everything that seems appealing before deciding what to actually eat.. I recall liking the Eggs Benedict on my most recent trip.. A bit bland, really. Like most things they serve.

The best part is the dessert - although usually, by the time I'm done with half of my second plate, I'm too stuffed to try more than one without assistance. Everything is so pretty to look at and they have so many options it makes your head spin... I usually like to share them - that way, I can get a taste of each of the 10 most appealing options before committing to a single one (assuming I have space by then). My favorite is the Baileys Panna Cotta (of course).. but again, not always there.

There is always a line. Do not be discouraged.. If you're there for the weekend champagne brunch, there will be plenty of mediocre alcohol on the other side to help you forget the wait.

Make sure you tip when you pay, or you're going to be seated in the worst section of the place far away from the food and out of sight, where the servers hardly ever come around. Two out of three times, I made sure to tip well and, as a result, had seats in an ideal location and attentive servers that never allowed my glass to empty, and once.. a server that, after offering me coffee when l was first seated, remembered me saying that I like my coffee at the end of my meal, to enjoy with dessert.

The deserts were overwhelming and delicious.  I had one small scoop of two different types of gelato (dark chocolate one was my favorite, so rich and creamy)!!

First off, the waiter, some Tapitio man-looking guy, was slow beyond belief to get my first drink.  I had already finished 2 plates of food and had to ask another waiter, who promptly brought over my drink.  Upon seeing this, Mr. Tapitio NOW brings over my drink, acting miffed that I had to call upon other wait staff to do your work (Guess what? Sorry to interrupt your siesta but you're not the only one who runs this taco stand!).  
""Jewish"" station: latkes - if I weren't goyem, you would have won me over here, but it wasn't anything special.  Same goes with the matzo meal fried chicken.  
Italian food station: excellent Lamb chops (was cooked medium but was still soft and tender).  No risotto, boo.  
Portuguese station: seafood boil was bland, shrimp and mussels overcooked.  Cooked fish station: tasted like it was sitting out for too long; meat was tough.  
Peking duck station:  way too much plum sauce overpowering the duck meat.  You could have had shoe leather in there and I wouldn't have tasted it.  
Ribeye\/Prime rib station:  ribeye was cooked right (pretty hard to mess up a ribeye though).  Prime rib was too salty, oddly enough, it tasted like ham!  I couldn't even finish it.  
Chinese food section: tasted like it came from a dollar Chinese food stall. Disgraceful.  
Cold seafood section:  raw oysters were dried out and tasted like they were going bad.  Cold crab legs were still frozen with some yellow crap on it, which I can only assume was hopefully cow butter.  
Beside the lamb chops and ribeye, the only saving grace to this overpriced meal was the dessert station: caramel toffee bread pudding, key lime squares, fresh crepes, creme brulee.  Overall, a disappointing dinner buffet.  Bacchanal was tastier with better ingredients and variety (though $10-15 more).  Bellagio buffet also better quality and food for about the same price.",0,0,0

The buffet features quite a bit of live action stations such as a great pasta station that allows you to make your own past. I highly recommend doing this because it won't disappoint. There is also a large selection of gourmet cheese, fresh fruit, unique pastas, and some melt in your mouth cheeses.  Plus if you add in the always fresh crab legs and shrimp cocktail, you got yourself a great all around buffet.

The service was trying their best.  We did sit there awhile for a few refills, but you can tell they were working they're butts off.  According to a pit boss, they've been cutting way back on the service, including all the servers and cocktail waitresses.  You can tell.

We did not get seated until 9:30PM. A four hour wait. I guess it was a holiday weekend (I love how they don't advertise the price anywhere), the meal was 40 per person. 

The buffet at first glance looked to be a very large amount of stations with food. However after walking around, you soon realize there are just a lot of counter space between each food item and it isn't as large as it seems. 

The Good:
1) The king crab legs were very good, although they were colder than I would like to eat them. 
2)Creme brulee was very good.
3) Service is very good

The Mediocre:
1) The prime rib was not good. It was incredibly chewy and salty. We ate the 7.99 prime rib dinner on the way to Vegas and that was 100% better than this one. 
2) The sushi selection was terrible, there were 2 varieties of rolls(California and Spicey Tuna), no shashimi. For 40 dollars i expected better.
3) I tried 4 desert cakes, all of them tasted really bad, i could not finish them. 
4)  Veal shortribs didn't taste good. 

So to sum it um, its not worth the hype for me. If you see a line away from the normal buffet line, expect to wait for 1-2 hours. None of the items here were that desirable to warrant a 40 dollar buffet. The item selection leave little to be desired. The service was very good, my soda was filled up 4 times without needing ask for it. The plates were cleared in a timely manner.

If you're still looking for a frugal dining experience, I would suggest showing up around 10 am. You pay breakfast price ($21), and get to eat both breakfast AND lunch (which gets switched out at 10:30 or 11, can't remember).

Breakfast
- Build your own bagel station with smoked salmon
- Custom omelets
- Congee or rice porridge, with traditional toppings
- Chicken apple sausage
- Fresh fruit of ALL varieties

- Flank steak
- Lamb
- Fried rice with Chinese sausage

We grabbed our plates and went for the food that mattered - red wine braised shortribs, shrimp cocktail, the aforementioned crab legs, lamb lollipops, ahi tuna, prime rib and about 6 desserts. The variety of food was superb, but stray away from the cooked fish. It was too dry. The best items were the crab legs and the lamb lollipops.

Food: for 27.99 the selection was awesome. This has easily become my favorite buffet. Food was fresh and there was variety. I was here for lunch the Korean short ribs and the Texas smoked mac and cheese are two things I'm now obsessed with. 
Ambiance: Not to crowded. But there were many full tables at lunch. Loved the decor. It was a peaceful place to eat all in all.

We ended up waiting over an hour to finally get to the front of the line. We finally realized why the line was so long and took forever, only one cashier was available. That was annoying. 
Anyway, we pay 26.99 a person and head inside and were seated waayyyy in the back. 
That's fine, we were starving and didn't care where we sat. I did a quick walk through the entire buffet to scope out what I wanted first and realized that the buffet line is actually pretty tiny. I guess after going to bacchanal and seeing their massive buffet it's hard to see a smaller one and be satisfied. I find a few items that look good and I'm kind of upset that nothing really tasted good. The ONLY thing I actually had seconds and thirds of was their sticky toffee pudding dessert. That was amazing.

Went for dinner on a Saturday night.  Got there around 5pm hoping to beat the dinner crowd.  There were probably 10 people ahead of us yet the line moved so slow!!

After paying in the front, we were greeted by an older lady dressed in tacky 70's outfit. Upon observation, I realized all of the hostesses were dressed the same.  So she walks us over to the closest table by the cashier area which doesn't even look like a dining area, it was just an awkward place to sit down and eat.  It felt like someone put tables and chairs in a big empty hallway.  So we asked her if we can sit in the actual dining area closer in, and she blatantly said ""go back in line and wait"".  Umm.....never mind, we'll just take it.  So we just stuck to the awkward dining room and sat down.  

Since I was starving, I made a beeline to the buffets.  The area was very clean and neatly organized.  There were varieties of foods and unique dishes that I've never seen at other Vegas buffets.  

5 stars for great presentation. 
2 stars for overly salty food.

Just about everything from snow crab to meat was extremely salty.  The only decent item was the prime rib and seasoned corn.  I was so disappointed because I had high expectations.  Even the dessert was unbearable.  My favorite madeleine's were spongy and flavorless.  Macaroons were soggy and gross. 
What's worse than the salty food was the service.  Our server was very rude and when we tried to ask for refills on our water he, like all of the other waiters avoided eye contact and whizzed past us so fast we couldn't get their attention.    After 20 mins we had no choice but to ask the GM for more water and to order some coffee.  He was apologetic and brought out or coffee personally.  And we didn't complain in a bitchy way, we just brought it to his attention that we've been trying to get refills on our waters for a long time.  Apparently this didn't go well with our waiter and he gave us dirty looks every time he passed by our table.  Totally ruined our dining experience.

I went there for lunch after reading the list of food selections posted on a sign at the entrance.  Everything seemed to sound better than it tasted, and nothing really stood out as spectacular or memorable.

I started out pretty lightly taking just three items (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=5jI7M5Be86FJFVm9Aeis-g), and I only enjoyed one.  That's approximately what I experienced throughout the meal, for every one item I liked there were always two that I didn't like.  The Kobe beef slider looked great, but the patty was ice cold when I bit into it.  The potstickers had big chunks of inedible pork fat.  The roasted strip loin was very good.  The slice I had was slightly overcooked for my preference, but it was tender, juicy and had good beef flavor.

The beef flank steak was also good.  Sliced thick with a sweet marinade, most of the cuts were overcooked by sitting under the heat lamp, but it had good flavor.  I love fish, but the fish here was awful.  The sea bass was not fresh and crumbled instead of flaked.  The grilled salmon was only partially cooked as I could see and taste the frozen core within.  The red snapper tasted bland.

I did find a pasta dish to my liking.  The Pappadella had flat noodles in a creamy tomato sauce and was laden with big chunks of shrimp.  On the other hand the lump crab mac 'n' cheese was creamy and cheesy but what little crab meat was already picked off.  The pizza tasted like crap I can buy at Sbarro and the sushi simply isn't worth mentioning.  I tried more than half of what was offered, and when nothing really wowed me I moved along to the desserts.

The decadent Oreo Mousse Cake (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg) was very chocolately, very rich and very sweet even for my chocoholic taste.  I love mint and I tried the Mint Chocolate Mousse (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=xtPuLkTf4GfltHy12Mpsow).  The mint mousse was thick and gummy, but the bottom layer of chocolate cake was very moist.  It was very much like eating toothpaste on top of chocolate cake!

The Blueberry Tart (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cExiCHnu3lfOCwVZwt7EQ) was good.  It was very light and not too sweet with a citrus mousse on top of thin shortbread and a light film of blueberry jam in between.  I liked the Tapioca Pearl Mousse with Mango and Lychee (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cnd5txt44wiE2US_S8oUw) also.  Soft mini tapioca balls are folded into a light mousse and layered over a mango flavored gelatin with a strip of lychee fruit inside.  I liked the Lime Mousse with Raspberry Gelle (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=wPy6KDF48APMGm3faAecJw) also, but more so because it was tart.  There is a small piece of sponge cake sandwiched in between the tart lime mousse and the sour raspberry gelatin.

I was so excited to eat at a restaurant at one of Steve Wynn's hotels because I heard he was vegan and all his restaurants were very vegan\/vegetarian friendly.  We did not do a regular dinner there as we already had other places booked so we decided to try the buffet.

We thought we were going to breakfast.  Perhaps this was our fault for not reading the sign more carefully.  It was brunch when we got there.  So, in addition to the $16 a piece we paid to get into an express line and bypass the hour wait it ended up a lot more expensive than breakfast.

The problem with this and any buffet I have visited is that it so hard to eat the amount of money you paid for.  It was over $100 for my husband and I to eat.  There are only so many pancakes, bagels and cupcakes one can eat at once.  I would have rather had another fine dining experience for the amount of money we paid.

With that said, for a buffet this was pretty good.  For me I was glad to see an abundance of vegetarian friendly food for me to eat and some of it was labeled vegan.  I thought that was very cool.  (I just don't think it is worth the money).  For everyone else there are of course traditional brunch items like bacon and whatever else usually shows up.

-Oh yea, snow or some sort of small king crab when i was there.
-Tons of sea food  and  some sushi.
-You have the roast and hot style meats.
-great sections of Italian and i think there was a some cury and Indian food there too.
-i believe they mix it up some time , but the selection is over the top.
Atmosphere is always stellar of course because it's at the Winn.
 
 I hate this place because they never hint of you to stop eating or drinking. Also the belly bulging after you eat, I most definitely don't go to the pool or expose my torso area.

The Friday & Saturday dinner price is around $40 a person & they have a menu with a few of the items available that night. My dad & I decided to walk around before we paid to eat there.

Decor: Beautiful. By far one of the most beautiful & well laid out buffets on the strip. It's almost like walking into a fairy tale with the many colors & bright lights. 

Service: Our waitress was very kind, she could have come back a little bit more often but her personality was outstanding the times she did come back. 

& now what everyone has been waiting for, the food.

I don't know why people have been complaining that the food isn't good. I thought it was one of the better buffets on the strip. The way I see it is, if you leave a buffet wondering where you can get a quick snack at then it probably wasn't good. I left this buffet not wanting to eat another piece of food for a week. The chefs are willing to make you the food items made to order if you have special needs like no dairy or if you're a vegetarian. They don't have a huge load of items which I tend to like better because that means to me quality over quantity. 

My first plate I got the mashed potatoes, a piece of BBQ meatloaf, chicken marsala, the maple fried chicken, a bowl of chicken noodle soup, & some penne pasta. It was all delicious. Nothing was overly salty or greasy & it all tasted pretty damn good.

I had about 3 plate fulls of crab & shrimp & damn, it was delicious. You can't go to a $40 per person place & not fill up on seafood (unless you're not a seafood person).

DESSERT:
could have been better. I find that I don't really like most desserts at most of the buffets. They had candy apples which I've never seen before & was excited to try it until I tried to bite into it & almost broke my teeth on the rock hard outer coating. The oreo cake was to die for & the crepes that are made to order was splendid. 

CONCLUSION:
Would I go back to this buffet ? Absolutely.",7,2,1

I've literally been here a few dozen times; I'm pretty much a regular player in the poker room (best room by far!), so this is basically free cafeteria food -- 1st world problems :)

Well, the food quality for a buffet is great. Rarely is the food not fresh, but it does happen once in awhile. The decor is beautiful, and the food stations are kept clean and presentable. Most of the hostesses are quite friendly. 

While the food is great, the selections are limited compared to my favorite buffets: the Bellagio and Rio. 

The service is hit or miss. Most of the time it's decent to excellent, but on my latest visit, not one refill. Quite disappointing for a 5-star resort and a $40 buffet. If I had actually paid for the meal, I probably wouldn't come back for a long while. I do appreciate the good waiters\/waitresses that have treated me very well over the years (Nicole is one of the best!), however I think it's time to take a break for now.

I'd heard from a close friend that this would accomodate a vegan diet as the owner of The Wynn was vegan himself.

We arrived in plenty time knowing there would be a relatively long queue, but the wait overall wasn't too bad- roughly 30-45 minutes. The seating, as far as my first buffett goes, wasn't bad at all. Good space between tables and clean tables.

When I went up to pick my first plate, to be honest, I was a little disappointed. I went over the whole buffet to see what the vegan options were like and I wasn't really impressed. There were some potatoes and mixed vegetables (which, to be fair, are standard fair at any restaurant), also some rice dishes. However, there wasn't anything set out particularly for vegan customers. I asked a few chef's at each section if there was an available vegan option (or if a dish was vegan that wasn't labelled as such) and at each section I was told ""no"" or ""not available"". Which, again, was surprising to me, considering the owner of the hotel is known for ""accommodating"" vegan customers. 

The desert options matched this also, but to be fair the few options available to vegans- tapioca, especially made chocolate-chip muffins and sorbet- were more than adequate to finish of the buffet experience. 

However, overall, I feel that $40.00 for this experience was very expensive for a vegan customer looking to get something a little better considering the basis behind the buffet. A shame really!",3,0,0

I'm not sure if they got a good reputation and cut back, lost the chef, or just realized they didn't have to do things so nice and people would still go.  

Buffet is very hard to do well.  The food sits out, and continues to cook while people aren't taking it.  Pasta's get over cooked and mushy.  Meats dry out.  Pizza gets cold and the cheese gets dry.

If they want an all-the-steak-they-can-eat $10.99 buffet, walk down the street to Circus Circus. If they want the best ingredients in town, don't go to a buffet. There's tons of fantastic restaurants to choose from.

However, as buffets go, the Wynn is our favorite (aside from the Sterling brunch at Bally's, but that's over the top) for good food, lots of it, and no fuss. The quality and variety can vary -- I read an interesting review on here about the ethnicity of the kitchen staff versus the best food, and I think he's right that there is a connection. However, the desserts are also wonderful -- the coffee ice cream is possibly the best I've ever had. All are homemade and a cut above the usual. 

Compared to other buffets, such as the fairly good Paris, the pretty good Mandalay Bay, and the mediocre Luxor, the Wynn is a wee bit more expensive (though I admit I have not tried the Bellagio) but worth the money. Two suggestions, however: be careful what time you go, as there is almost always a line. Second, go later in the shift. For example, if brunch ends at 11:30 and lunch begins at 12:00, go at 11:15 -- you pay the less expensive breakfast price and can get lunch too.",0,0,0

It was like no buffet I have ever experienced. When we planned our trip to Vegas last week I insisted we go there and hyped it up pretty good to my husband, who got pretty excited for it. Then when we were in line, I had a ""oh crap"" moment. Did I hype it up so much that it couldn't possibly meet expectations? Do I just remember it being better than what it was? Did I put it on a pedestal it would never live up to? Well, the answers are no, no, and no. It was still awesome and we both loved it and had to restrain ourselves from eating every meal here.

An added bonus from last time - Steve Wynn added vegan\/vegetarian options to all his menus, and I was happy the buffet was included. I am a vegetarian and the amount of options for me were endless. Also, it made it very clear when there was meat in something that wasn't completely obvious, taking out a lot of the guess work I am faced with at places like this. And their vegan options? If I could cook like this, I would go vegan, no problem. The vegan alfredo sauce, which I tried elsewhere and hated, was better than the real alfredo sauce they had. Even my carnivorous husband was impressed. Don't worry meat eaters, there are still more than enough options for you. But usually when a veg goes to a buffet we don't get as much out of it as meat eaters - not the case at the Wynn.

Also, about the price. No, it's not cheap, but I have a hard time finding anything in Vegas, at least on the strip, that is cheap. Unless you are going to the dive of dives of course. But instead of stopping at a random restaurant at a hotel and getting a bill for $75 (two people) for mediocre food, which seemed standard, I would rather pay the extra $5-10 here and eat my heart out.",1,0,1

I used to think Bellagio was the best but my latest trip wasn't so great. I don't  remember the exact cost, but the Wynn price came out to a few dollars cheaper even. And the food ...

That is the best Chilean sea bass I've had at a buffet. It was so moist and tender.  The herb crusted salmon wasn't bad either. Flaky and moist as well. The rest of the food is the typical buffet fare. Their shrimp cocktail is noticeably larger than any other place I've been. They differentiate a little with their various ceviche, salads, and their coconut flavor and pineapple flavor ice cream which was a delight.

The thing that did damper my experience was the waitress. She seemed to have disappeared during her shift so I never got any refills of my drink. The waitress finally returned during our dessert to bring tea\/coffee. I pretty sure this is an isolated incident however.",0,0,0

Sushi
Cocktail Shrimp
Prime Rib
Ribs
Fried Chicken
Roast Beef
Ice Cream
Cupcakes

One station I never pass is Alaskan King crab legs and jumbo shrimp cocktails.  My other fave is the grill station.    Their rack of lambs are to die for.    I can eat 10 pcs in just one visit.   Yes,  their size is microscopic, but they are THAT GOOD.    Don't forget the mint jelly as condiment for the lamb.

Was it worth it? No. Maybe because I'm not a breakfast food person and most of the food were breakfast items. The line went pretty quickly. We were in line, paid, and seated within an hour.

They had a bagel station, shrimp cocktail, sushi area, Asian inspired food, create your own omelette station, carving station, create your own eggs benedict station, Mexican inspired food, breakfast pizzas\/pastas, cheese\/breads, oatmeal, and salads.

I got to try their smoked salmon which was nothing special. Prime rib was pretty salty, but they cooked it medium so not as pink as I would have liked. Plenty of shrimp cocktails, but how could you mess that up? Eggs benedict was a fail. You have a choice of lobster, original, and other choices, but they ran didn't have lobster or canadian bacon so you only had the choice of pork loin. Why ask me what I want if that's all you have! I ate a bite and threw it away. They had a congee (Asian porridge) station as well which I thought was pretty cool, but it wasn't hot at all, it was like room temperature...

As for the desserts, I was expecting something spectacular! However, I was pretty disappointed. They have 2 sides of desserts and they were all basically repeats. They have a small selection of cakes, ice cream, and other stuff. The only thing that stuck out to be was the passionfruit tapioca, but I just scrapped off the passionfruit and ate that.

Service:
Our server was friendly to everyone else, but us. Took awhile to take the dishes away. Took awhile to refill our glasses and wouldn't even bother if we didn't ask.

Service was just OK here. Our waitress kept forgetting what drinks we ordered; not just once, but maybe 2-3 times. Other than that, it was ok. Food selection was pretty limited in terms of what they had, or maybe I just didn't like the majority of their selections. I ended up going back for a lot of the same things. I will say that I am impressed by their dessert bar. A lot of different options and varieties.

We get there, and the price is $49.99 AND NO SEAFOOD SPECIAL.

The layout makes it manageable and not overwhelming to find what you want, and everything was very fresh and well stocked. 


The service was quick and the dining area was very bright, open and inviting. I would be interested to try other buffets in town to be able to better compare this one, but the bar has been set VERY high after this experience.

There are many different types of food here, from crab legs to prime rib. Their meats are great. They didn't have much of a sushi selection though and no sashimi. The other items I tried were good too. Dessert is great too, but I only a few samples because I was already too full.

You wait in line to pay the cashier, then wait in another line to be seated.. It took us about 45 minutes from the time of entering the first line to get seated. 

We we were finally at the front of the line, I felt like I had just won the lotto! I was so excited for food!! We were greeted by the drab hostess who didn't even ask us to follow her but just started walking off.. She plopped us in the seats just 20 ft away from where the line was..  It was basically a foyer where some additional seats were placed.. No view of any of the buffet area at all.. We asked if we could be placed closer to the dining area, and she said, ""go wait back in line"" .. EW forget it.. we will stay here.

We immediately head to the buffet line and noticed there are PLENTY of tables open.. everywhere. What was with the seating hold up? 30 minutes to be seated? oh.. and the hostesses all look SO frumpy in their hideous air line stewardess want to be uniforms. They all look like they are wearing pink potato sacks.. Not flattering for any figure. Maybe that is why they are so ill tempered there. You would think a nice buffet like this would want their employees to look half decent? I guess not.

Are you supposed to have a server at buffets? Or someone that at least comes to offer you coffee? refill on beverages? Well..I guess not here.. The worker that collected our overdue plates made SURE to avoid eye contact and didn't check on us at ALL. I had to flag down the boss man to ask about our drinks, and he actually went above beyond to personally being us our coffee, and pour it for us. Now THAT'S service... To the server\/bus man\/scary man..

If it wasn't for the pretty decorations in the hotel (which is exquisite), Sharr would've been extra crabby. We paid upfront....there were 3 of us and the bill was $125. This shit better be good.

I was really impressed by the layout of the food stations, especially the dessert station which was outrageous. I really wanted to start with dessert first but everything else looked so damned good too. They even had different stations for international flavors. 

After about 30 mins or so, I have tried pretty much a little bit of everything. The sushi station was good however I didn't want to get full on rice. But I did get seconds on stir fried tofu and pumpkin ravioli. The meats here are, once again very dry. What is going on with the meats people? Get it right! 

The big hoorah for me was the dessert. I coudn't wait to get my hands on them. Each little pastry was so pretty and beautifully decorated.  I came close to getting one of each, lol. When I got back to my table and actually bit into one of them (it was a marshmallow), I nearly spit it back out. How long have they been sitting there?!?!

Service: The attentive staff was remarkable. Much better here than other buffets in Vegas. I ordered coffee, ginger ale, iced tea and water and the staff kept them coming and cleared the table when needed.

Food: THE MOST important thing about buffets is that the food MUST NOT BE OVERCOOKED and\/or DRY(especially if you are going in late after the lunch or dinner rush)... Everything I tried was not at all those things. There were a few items that needed salt but I preferred adding my salt rather than eating an entree that was too salty. With buffets there are always certain items that are a hit or miss due to personal preferences. Highlights: Chilean Seabass- melted in my mouth!! It was an absolute a delicacy and my favorite. The red snapper was very delicate as well. The steak, salads, and breads were good. Out of all the desserts my favorite were the wonderful gelato\/ice cream selection with a homemade crepe and the moist chocolate cake. FYI- they only serve crepes for dinner, so after 3:30pm. Also, since we had a late lunch the chefs had to turnover to dinner so they put out crab legs and other seafood items. The nice thing about this buffet is that they cut the legs in half so it's much easier to just pick the meat out of the open shell rather than having to deshell it yourself.

This is a pricier buffet but definitely worth trying at least once!

4 stars was within reach too, since the buffets were actually comp'd by the casino, not having to pay always makes food taste better!

this was my first visit after their remodel, can't really tell a lot has been done other than seats are different and I think maybe the tile on floors.

round 1, on waitress recommendation, went to get a few slices of the tomahawk ribeye, was done a beautiful medium rare, nice char.  got a slice of lamb too, and for good measure another piece of lamb from the Mediterranean section (was labeled incorrectly as duck confit, but easy to see it wasn't). funny the lamb from the Mediterranean section looked overdone, but was actually a lot better than the one sliced from the meat section? oh well, still good

round 2, had to get another couple slices of ribeye, added some maple pork belly\/bacon, couple pieces of venison blueberry sausage and also the fennel sausage.  the ribeye was a bit fatty this round, should have waited for him to slice into the new piece.  maple pork belly was just so-so, and I should have passed on the sausages....overly dry

took a little break from going into a meat coma, thought I would break it up with a bowl of new England style clam chowder....this was excellent, nice, thick, rich chowder....YUM

on to round 3, grabbed a couple stone crab claws, a couple pieces of salmon and eel sushi, and a piece of sea bass. this round was a whiff too, the crab claws weren't too tasty, sushi was decent, and the sea bass probably saw its peak about an hour ago....

round 4, jumped to some of the vegetarian spring rolls they just brought out, and had to grab a bowl of the parmesan pork rinds! tried a few of the ""dim sum"" items too.  This round too was another whiff, the spring rolls lacked a lot of flavor, and I probably should leave dim sum choices to spring mountain road!......I did like the pork rinds though, can't go wrong with lowbrow munchies right?

decided that was enough, on to dessert.  not a huge selection here, so I just settle for a scoop of raspberry sorbet and one of mango\/vanilla.  These were a nice, light, refreshing way to cleanse the palate after the meal.

All in all, I think the buffet is only around 40 bucks for dinner, so compared to others, it was a good value for the money....although we were comp'd, so even better!

Service was good, wait staff pretty attentative, but I think the newer Wicked Spoon and Bachanaal buffets have stolen some of the limelight.  (FYI, think Bachanaal overrated)
The standards are pretty much what you can expect at the Wynn, not like the cattle feed at some buffets, so it was a nice dinner",4,1,1

We went for breakfast, so they had eggs, pancakes, french toast, waffles, the usual. They also had all the regular stations, like salad, asian, meat, mexican and all that.

The best thing I ate was the grilled corn on the cob. I didn't really LOVE anything else, though the Prime rib was good (cold though). They didn't have any real toppings in the salad section, but I was able to find them throughout the rest of the buffet.

So for a sixty dollar breakfast for two, I wasn't all that impressed. We weren't terribly hungry, and a little bit hungover, so it wasn't really money well spent. Watching the poor guy at the table across from us hold his head, looking like he had the roughest night of his life was hilarious though.

I tried trying as much as I could but nothing struck me as awesome, other than the huge variety (I actually liked the buffet at Foxwoods in Connecticut better).

I also got pretty much one of every dessert they offered, and some of them were so bad I needed to rinse my mouth. The only one that was really good was the little cream puff with a raspberry in it.

When you are five months pregnant, it is easy to feel excluded from all of the activities Sin City has to offer but buffets just happen to be in my limited wheelhouse of things I can do so I jumped at the chance to check out The Buffet at the Wynn.

Even at 9:30 am, the line was popping with people but fortunately it moved quickly and within ten minutes or so I was seated at a table that I knew would soon be groaning from the heaviness of all the plates I was about to set on it.

This is definitely a place where you can eat with your eyes -- the stations of food is endless. I'm pretty sure I got all my Fitbit steps in walking from one side to the other and when I started creepin' backwards to add some more hash browns to my plate again. It starts off with some light fare -- yogurt, fruit, granola, to pastries, to breakfast pizza to pancakes, to eggs and bacon, to carving station to Mexican to dim sum to Japanese, to lox and capers. Then there is an entirely different room of desserts. I ran out of room on my plate five seconds in!

That being said out of all the things that I tried there were only two things worth eating loads of:
+ Yogurt and Muesli (SO BORING, I could have made this at home)
+ Buttermilk Pancakes (Freshly made with Berry Compote and Vanilla Cream, don't waste your carbs on the corn or buckwheat)

I was super excited about their dim sum station but the congee was rather lackluster. I took one bite and was done with it -- it was extremely lacking in flavor and condiments. Give me my fish sauce man! BBQ pork buns were dry -- you are much better off paying $10 for two at Red 8 across the the hotel.

Overall, it was fun to experience but I don't see myself coming back again.",15,9,14

Two the creme brulee was a bit runny which ruin the taste because of texture.   Three the baked salmon was bland i guess the chef needs to go back to culinary school because he forgot to use salt and pepper.  Four the shrimp was mushy, i guess it was old or sitting out all day.  Five the crepe was made in front of you which was nice but the cook was sweating profusely which turn me off unless you like your crepe seasoned with her salty sweat.  I got the strawberry crepe covered with chocolate syrup.  Sounds good right, nope they used a runny strawberry jam as the filling not fresh ones.  Finally they had the smallest restrooms in the buffet area which was like 3 stalls, so there was a line.  Nothing like the smell of @$$ to enhance your eating experience.

Heres what they did right.  One i love the risotto it was creamy and flavorful.   Two they had a wide selection of deserts.

Atmosphere: 4\/5 (looked like a beautiful place to have brunch from the entrance)

This is a review of the time I spent outside of the buffet. I came here on Labor Day with my family for brunch. We arrived at 10:30 A.M. and were thankful that there wasn't a line like Cesar's Bacchanal Buffet (our go-to). We found out that it was $50 for brunch, but we were already there AND hungry, so why not?! After my bil paid for the steep $50 brunch, there was a table ready within the first few minutes, but the hostess at the podium let us know that it wasn't close to the buffet. We let her know that we preferred a table closer to the buffet, so we waited for the next available table. We spent time admiring the beautiful floral decor and framed butterflies hung on the wall. 

The table was ready within 5-10 minutes. We were told to follow another host to the table, but as we rounded up two toddlers, she was gone. The hostess at the podium asked us to step to the side, so we did. She helped get another 3-5 parties of two to six people seated. They all followed a host to the RIGHT side of the podium (where she said our table would be, but that it would not be close to the buffet). The host that we were supposed to follow came back from the LEFT side of the podium (closer to the buffet) and said that our table was no longer available because we did not follow her. HELLO?!? You didn't wait for us to follow you! And how is the table suddenly unavailable when the last couple of parties were seated to the room RIGHT of the podium (further from the buffet)? We were left speechless. Then, the hostess at the podium (pictured in the photo) proceeded to ask us, ""Did you not want to follow her?"" WHAT?!! Why would we NOT want to follow her? We are HUNGRY! You took our money; we just want to be seated to let the feasting commence! Anyway, no apology from either host... Hostess at the podium says that they will clear a table right away, but we watched parties of six or more enter and get seated, so after waiting 20 minutes off to the side without any apology, my brother-in-law asked for a refund. The manager or HBIC came out and said there was a table ready. OK, all of a sudden... there just happens to be a table available right when we were ready to leave? No, thank you. I expressed my anger to her, and did not hear one apology! Perhaps, these bad attitudes stem from the bad attitudes of upper management (the HBIC).

Anyway, I really don't know how this buffet gets four or five star reviews when their employees do not know how to treat customers. I understand that it is Labor Day and no one wants to work on holidays, but come on... If you guys are going to be bitchy and tell customers that their table was given away because they did not follow the host, and ask ridiculous questions like, ""Did you not want to follow her?"" then please do us all a favor and STAY HOME on Labor Day next year because some of us are actually trying to enjoy our holiday weekend. Hopefully, I will be able to try this buffet for brunch the next time I return to Vegas when upper management takes this review into consideration and sends their employees through 'How to be Polite' and 'How to Give Appropriate Responses' training to prevent this from ever happening again.",4,5,0

The price was 40-48 something.
First off, i was disappointed at the dessert quality. The selection was good but the taste is more suitable for people who like diet dessert or something. I guess it's healthy for you but i'd rather exercise than eating sugar-free, light cream type of dessert. I like my crepe with ""heavy"" whipped cream but the chef couldn't deliver that. Since i ordered extra whipped cream, i had to eat extra ""light"" whipped cream. How sad. Same with their creme brulee and other mousse cake. I just don't think food that are not supposed to be healthy should taste healthy...like...ok the point is unhealthy food is unhealthy food and it should not ""pretended"" to be healthy. So it was a big disappointment for me cuz i love dessert and cream stuff.It's the first thing i eat when i go to a buffet and first impression is important (hence the two stars).
Onto the real food, i like the lamb and the prime rib was good. Not bad but not memorable. A lot of people line up for the king crab legs cuz it was probably the only thing that was worth eating there. They were nice enough to cut open the crab leg to expose the meat so you don't have to do much work to eat it. 
The sushi bar only have 3 type of sushi: California, shrimp, and some plain roll. They have smoked salmon which was good and some white anchovies that is good also but that was it. 
There are more dishes like the normal dish you can find at a Chinese and Indian fast food chains. Variety of cheese, some other stuff that i tried and didn't like.
So i won't be returning unless they cook their dessert with better ingredients like real whipped cream and butter. It's sin city and i would like to indulge my gluttony sometimes.",1,0,0

We had timed it perfectly arrived around 10:30 and were there for the tail end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch for the breakfast prices. Unexpectedly awesome! So that meant we ate twice as much because there were twice as many things to try.  Ugggh we were such fattty's we didn't leave till 2 lol then we had to stroll down to the pool and nap it off. 

Highlights for me were the smoked salmon, the fruit soups for breakfast, the pea risotto, and the steak they had at lunch. My friend had eaten at the red rocks buffet earlier in the week and she said they didn't have steak on their buffet and she was there for dinner. Gasp!

First thing I went for? The meat. I love prime rib and racks of lamb and man were they GOOD. The pastas were also surprisingly tasty, especially the pumpkin ravioli. Other good things were the veal and the desserts! OMG the desserts! There were so many choices and I wanted to eat everything! I ate so many macarons that I thought I would burst. There were also ice cream, many types of cakes, meringues, puddings, and so many other types of desserts. Definitely save room for the desserts.

Unfortunately, the crab legs failed to impress me and after eating a few, I definitely lost interest. Maybe seafood isn't my thing. Also the creme brulee was runny but I didn't really mind since I love creme brulee.

I was pleasantly surprised by the diverse selection, especially the succulent dim sum. I followed that with a combo of scrambled eggs cheese enchiladas and a spicy but juicy Portuguese sausage.

Salads-Exotic selection. However, they need to work on not over-dressing their salads as they end up very soggy.

Cheese\/Salami\/Prosciutto Section-I love cheese but they should really focus on serving the types of cheese that are more edible by itself. Who the heck is going to eat a cube of manchego or romano? Those are cooking cheeses for crying out loud!

Pasta-The gnocchi with vodka-cream sauce is pretty legit! Everything else was ok.

Seafood-You can tell this is the best part in the main entree selection by the amount of people lined up. Crab legs are a must!

Asian Station-Kalbi marinated ribs and tandoori fish. 'Nuff said.

Pizza-Thin crust, NY style-gotta love it!

Sushi-don't even try. GROSS!

Dessert-With a whole room dedicated to dessert, they've got to pride themselves with this station. In fact, it is my FAVORITE! Their creme brulee is definitely close to one you could get in Paris.

I will definitely be back here often.  At 45 dollars for a dinner buffet, that is priced cheaper than most restaurants that you can find at the Wynn.",6,1,3

I am giving this place a 4 because of a 5 for service and 3 for food. Like most vegans, I am prepared to compromise at most places and won't mark them down for having a limited vegan selection but I was expecting more from a Wynn establishment. 

The small plates guacamole and hummus were very good and for dessert I asked if there was anything beyond the one vegan choice (tapioca) and the extremely nice chef went in the back and got some yummy vegan ice cream. Also I went to the pasta station and the chef whipped up a wonderful vegan Alfredo with my choice of add-ins. However, when I asked if any of the pastas were vegan he said no. WTF???  Why offer a vegan Alfredo but no vegan pasta?  No matter. I put it on some lovely vegetables and it was delicious. I highly recommend this to other vegans as the sauce was very, very good. 

Also, I want to note that the chef did offer to try and get some vegan pasta from somewhere else in the hotel. He didn't seem put off by it either - he seemed genuinely like he wanted me to really enjoy the food. So A+ service. 

So, Vegans, the key here is to ask if you don't see something that works for you they will work hard to make you happy.",6,1,3

The carby dishes were fantastic--Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, pastas, etc--and likely on purpose to fill you up! Seafood was plentiful and many meat options to match.

And the most awful item of the night goes to their gnocchi. Tasteless and hard. And for the first time, I broke my personal rule and got a few items from their Asian section. Okay, well, just the dim sum section, but to my amazement their har gow and siu mai was actually pretty decent. Not bad at all. I still refuse to eat anything from their sushi section though. The sushi still does not look appetizing. And of course I saved an extra stomach just for dessert. In the past, their flan was my favorite but they didn't have any this time. *sad face* So I just went and picked out, umm, six other desserts. Yes, way too much.

They even have an area that is mainly vegetarian. One of the things that I really liked about the buffet was the seafood and the meat selection. I had the brisket, which was delicious, and the king crab was also realllly tasty. When I first came I opted to skip out of a having some salad, but then as I made my way down the line I came across a variety of salads in little glass cups. There was probably about 6-7 different varieties. I tried the one with pears, which was absolutely delicious. The flavors came together really well, and it was overpowering in the sweetness of the pears. Another item that I really enjoyed was the pulled pork with coleslaw that was on top of something similar to cornbread. The pork was really tender and moist paired well for the coleslaw.

Some of the items were not as tasty though. When I saw the pad thai it looked like it would be full of flavor, but when I tried it I found it to be bland. There was another item that I believe was called ""sicilian pizza"" which I tried because I wanted to try something new. It consisted on a thick layer of hard bread, dried out tomato sauce, and cheese that had hardened over form being left over too long. Needless to say, it wasn't good and it just tasted like bread.

The dessert area was also filled with a variety of different items. There are about 8 different gelato flavors, but they taste more like ice cream rather than gelato. However, the gelato comes in these adorable pastel colored cups. There are also candied apples, but they are extremely hard to take a bite into, and wouldn't be something that I would try again. Another item that I wouldn't try again would be the dipped marshmallows. There are marshmallows that are dipped in chocolate or white chocolate, but the flavors are too phenomenal.

The overall service from workers was pretty good. The servers were attentive with filling up our drinks and asking if there was anything else that they would do. The ambiance was also nice, because right when you walk in you see all these bright flowery colors.

One thing I love about buffets is that you can try things and then be like, ""Meh, I'm not going to waste stomach space on the rest of that.""  I found myself saying, ""Darn it, that was good, I'm not going to have room. 

I could go on ad nauseum about the great dishes, but what impressed me the most was that there were no weak dishes.  Many buffets will have a few good dishes, but the rest came out of the freezer because people like BBQ meatballs.  Even the ""filler"" dishes like meatloaf and shrimp cocktail were spectacular.

Eek! Methinks not. 

Was there for Brunch\/Dinner.

37 per person on a weekday for brunch? Strike one.
(before anyone asks, it was a few days before christmas so the prices were inflated - Holiday weekday brunch)

So, what was the seasonal awesomeness that bumped up the price?
Pumpkin ravioli? Super sweet and cinnamon-y pumpkin pie filling wrapped in pasta. Yeah... what else was seasonal... beats me.

The buffet is quite a bit smaller than bellagio, and the selection was comparitively small. they had hand rolls with spicy tuna which = cone of nori with tons of rice and a small ball of spicy tuna. Took one bite and dropped the rice bomb back onto my plate. The rest of the sushi rolls were kinda meh..

The majority of stuff was pretty boring. Nothing really stood out, and most of the food trays were mislabeled. After the changeover to dinner (we weren't there long, we got in about 30 minutes before the changeover) many of the signs were still wrong, the food was still unimpressive, and I was still disappointed by all of the ""Wynn is the end all be all buffet""  comments. 

1) the buffet is BEAUTIFUL if you're seated in the small sky-lighted garden seating area. Otherwise you'll be seated on ostrich skin in a boring pastel shaped room. I preferred the seating at the Bellagio since we didn't get the nicely lit outdoorsy section. 

2) The food was on par with Bellagio. What stood out?
a. King crab legs (Bellagio had snow crab legs) again, waterlogged cold flavorless mush. Why people lined up and walked away with 20 legs per plate still confuse me. I had 3, and I only finished them so they didn't go to waste. 

3) Sweet Gulf Shrimp time.. How I missed you. These were larger than the ones at Bellagio, which were larger than the P-Ho ones. They were all about as tasty and snappy in texture, just slight size differences. 

Considering this was the most expensive of the 3 buffets, I also ate the least here. I just wasn't that impressed, and there wasn't much that I really wanted to eat. It saddens me. 

Service was not on par with Bellagio. Where Bellagio made all the dishes disappear, at the Wynn, the plates sat on our tiny little table. Our drinks were served in smallish cups, and were not refilled for quite some time. Empty drink glasses weren't taken away with the places until I put them on top of the plates. Wierd, considering the motto that everything is better at the Wynn. 

2 stars. I wouldn't have been impressed if I was charged 20 dollars instead of 37. I still would have chosen Bellagio. The fact that I did pay as much as I did would make this a 1 star considering the other options. No Food Poisoning and Food on par with Bellagio (but a much smaller selection) gives this place an extra star.

I'll try it again in the future I guess, maybe, but I don't have high hopes for this buffet. Bellagio FTW.


As I read through the comments, Laurissa Y. sorta summed up my feelings of this buffet. She also reminded me to mention that it was the ""Holiday weekday brunch"" that I paid for.

Variety isn't huge, but it's enough. EVERYTHING looks rather appetizing, there was nothing at the Wynn buffet that i would have rather killed myself than to try. 

A party of 4 arrived at 2.35pm and we got in after 30 minutes. 

I made my way to get some cocktail shrimps which were big and succulent. A bite of smoked salmon, trout and anchovies, some greek salad, all above average for buffet standards. 

Then some alaskan king crab legs. huge, meaty and cut for your convenience, all you gotta do is use a fork and pick the meat out. Relatively fresh and I seasoned it with a hint of warm butter.

The prime rib was more of a medium, which i prefer medium rare. It was alright, juicy and not too fatty. The lamb chop was not bad, also medium. I also got some mussels which was cooked well, not dry at all! As well as some asparagus which was very dry. 

Dessert time, I got a crepe which is my favourite from all the vegas buffets. Beautifully presented with house made whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries. The creme brulee was freshly made, and the best creme brulee i've had in a buffet. The tiramisu was also pretty good, I finished everything. The strawberry champagne mousse was a little on the sour side and I only had 2 bites of it.

We sat by the garden and it was bright and pretty. Our server was much nicer and more prompt than any other vegas buffets I've recently visited, very courteous too.

***

Tip: Come before 2.45pm to get in line, so you can eat dinner for the price of lunch. They switch over at 3.30pm. Cheap people style! $35 (lunch price incl tax) for dinner! Crab legs come out only during dinner

Favourites: King crab legs, (not snow!) Big and juicy cocktail shrimp. Higher quality ingredients and prepared with more care. Presentation is outstanding

Do not want: a little expensive. Long lines for king crab legs. medium cooked prime rib (but if you go before they cut to the middle, it's medium rare) and lamb chops

We went there on a weekday.  Dinner was $38 and if you wanted unlimited wine and champagne, it would be an additional $7.  Already buzzed, we opted against that, but  I rounded it up to $40. It's a buffet, but might as well throw in a little bit of tip right?  (If I had known sooner how great the service was, I would have definitely put in a lot more).

First off, there was about 12 of us that went, and the way that buffets work is that they don't\/can't move their seating around because it would just mess up their count.  It was super busy that night and it would have taken a long time for us to get seated and so the hostess tried to get us two tables as close to each other as possible.  You could tell she was definitely trying, which was way sweet of her.  After being seated, it took all but ONE minute for a server to come asking about our drinks.  I was the only one at the table when she arrived because everyone else had scampered off to see what was on the menu.  I ordered a round of water for all and a soda for myself and she brought it all back right when my friends came back to the table and then happily took another round of drink orders.  Fantastic!

There was a wide selection of food available, but there were three things most notable - the Asian food, the Seafood and the Prime Rib.  Now, I usually don't care too much for Asian food at a buffet, but each item had it's own twist to it that made it very tempting to eat.  I'm glad I did because delicious.  Every item was really good, and it didn't feel too greasy or filling.  The only downfall was the dumplings.  They tasted like something my ex-boyfriend would whip up from some that were frozen.  It was very meh and (along with the memories) left a very bitter taste in my mouth; however, everything else MORE than made up for it.  

Their selection of seafood was OFF THE HOOK.  I swear, the Alaskan Crab Legs were the biggest I have seen in my life AND they were HELLA GOOD! I had three plates worth, at least.  There was a wide selection of other seafood items, including Sushi, but damn, the crab was so good that I couldn't fill myself with anything else.

Lastly, the Prime Rib was to DIE FOR.  The moment the butcher was cutting me a piece, I knew I was in for something amazing.  I already felt my mouth begin to water as he placed it on my plate.  It was cooked just right, savory and so tender!  It was definitely an experience that goes beyond words, so just trust me on this.  I'm definitely a meat and potatoes kind of girl, and the prime rib was hella legit.  Better than anything I've ever had at some of the ""higher end"" places in LA. 

For Vegetarians out there, they had a wide selection of pastas, salads and vegetarian rolls! :D (enough to make your money worth it... that is, if you eat enough of it)

Overall, it was definitely worth the $40.  Don't go too drunk because you'll miss out on a great experience!  The lunch is slightly cheaper, but I don't think they have the same type of menu items that were mind blowing (i.e. the crab and prime rib), but if you're on a budget, definitely check out the lunch... it'll likely be better than any other buffet... even their dinner ones!",0,0,0

Taking over the top spot (buffet wise) from Bellagio, The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is everything that Bellagio's buffet has, only better.  The decor and layout are fantastic and you feel like you are at a restaurant instead of at an every day buffet.

The food stations consist of high quality, culture\/region specific foods that are prepared by chefs right in front of you and in some cases on demand.  The Asian selection (both Chinese and Japanese choices) are very authentic and always prepared fresh.  I highly recommend the egg rolls...in all seriousness some of the best I've ever had.  Their sushi selection is very good as well.  Other selections include soup\/salad, a pasta\/Italian station, the grill, a carving station, various Mexican dishes, fruits and finally the Asian selection discussed above.

Where The Buffet really excels is in the dessert area.  Completely separate from the food is an array of small dishes with cakes, pies and cookies, along with ice cream of many flavors, gelato and sorbet, not to mention candy apples and other goodies.  The desserts are amazing and if you have enough room to eat a few they really make the experience worth it.

The line can become a bit long during the weekend and an express line is only available to guests staying at either the Wynn or Encore Tower Suites.  Guests of the main hotel (Wynn\/Encore) are required to wait in the general public line.  While the price for dinner can attract some negative attention ($42.00 with tax per person) the Buffet at Wynn is still the one to go to.  A+",0,0,0

Received a comp when we checked in at the Wynn hotel and used it the last day of our stay. OMG! The food was absolutely terrible. If you want to feast on grease, food oozing with fat and pastries that taste a few days old this is the perfect place to go. Both my husband and I are used to very fresh fruit, breads and dishes made from wholesome ingredients. This place provided nothing that even resembled fresh. If you don't care what your food looks like or even tastes like then this is the place for you. Recommend anyone with a palate stay clear of this place.

Now to the Wynn Buffet - the service was great, and deserves a 5. 

The food had highs and lows. The cons - I was surprised that the options at the salad bar, fresh fruit, and breads were pretty limited. There was a section with a few types of cheeses and dried fruit, but the cheddar and Gouda were surprisingly flavorless. The pros - pasta station was pretty awesome, and the dessert selection (mini cakes, Rice Krispie treats, ice cream, etc) were good.

Overall, I would say those who want a large selection of meats and desserts, or who want a large quantity of food, may be pleased but it was underwhelming given the expectations for Wynn and the $40 dinner price tag.",0,0,0

The Alaskan king crabs are probably the finest items served at the buffet. They are only served during dinner, but they are so fresh. They come pre-sliced, chilled, and are mouth-watering sweet. I've never had king crabs this good, not even at Joe's Stone Crab in Miami.",0,0,0

A lovely lady named Sandra signed us up for a Red Card(wynn\/encores players card). It included $10 free play and if you get 150 points you earn two free buffets. Spent the next 4 hours or so playing video bj and slots in order to accumulate it. I lost $100 in the process while my friend came up $100. I figured these buffets are usually worth $70-80 for two people so losing $100 was no big deal.

The next day we head over for dinner with the kids. Apparently they charge half price for kids 3 and over. Really? $20 for a kid who will probably only have a slice of pizza? We were originally going to go to the M and I heard kids under 5 are free. But anyway...

As I started my first plate, I was excited since they seemed to have a pretty good selection. As the night went on, I realized they only had 3-5 plates in certain stations. I think at the carving they only had two types of meat? Seafood was mainly crabs, no lobsters as previous yelpers have mentioned. I guess it was only a limited time according to the guy behind the counter. Overall I just wasn't too impressed. The best dish they had was probably the pizza which was thin and crispy.

We waited in line for over an hour, & I felt ready to give birth by the time they let us through. It seems everyone got the same idea of eating breakfast here. Whatever. I figured the food would be amazing, so it didn't matter.

The Wynn buffet failed to impress. It was among my absolute faves in 2006; in 2015, not so much. It seems the quality is just not the same. But did they simply fail to maintain the quality of their food, or did I just not know any better back in oh six? Maybe the rumors are true: in Vegas, they have a habit of cost-cutting -- by firing well-paid chefs & replacing them with cooks that can basically follow a recipe.

We paid $30+\/person for brunch & 'unlimited' drinks. Plus taxes & tip, that's around $45 per person. There were 4 of us, & we were to tip our server around $30 total. For that, I thought we should at least have gotten mediocre service. We didn't. Our server got us our first round of drinks, & then disappeared. Like the Wynn buffet 'quality' that I remember from '06. POOF. Just gone. Just done serving guests.

The worst part was that with a seemingly vast array of food, I ran out of options. The selections were, I believe, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican & Continental. But it seems they chose to please the 'majority': there were a bunch of meat dishes, yet very few corny, mundane seafood selections, &  carbs to fill you up. I'm Pescetarian & need to eat all cooked stuff, since I'm also pregnant; my options were reaalllly limited.

Eventually, hubby asked me if I wanted a veggie omelet. This had me going into an almost trance-like state, as I contemplated why in the world he was offering me a humble omelet when we just paid around $45 per person to eat at this fancy schmancy place. Maybe inflation is to blame, & that amount was just for the ambiance, photo ops & our limited 2-hr stay at the buffet. For that much, I really did feel like we deserved better options or special ones, not ""recycled"" food like frittatas, bread pudding, & deep fried stuff that masks the real taste of ingredients that are about to go bad. The overall selection did not seem special. Not ""$45 special"".

Basically, I had some poor excuse for sushi (there were about 6 crappy selections for their rice-stuffed sushi rolls - it seems the ingredients were the same & only varied in amount & presentation), half an average omelet, 'recycled' food (lobster & something frittata, some fried shrimp thing), an A-OK congee, a bit of days old pretzel bread & some nothing-out-of-the-ordinary desserts. Nothing seemed exciting, or very fresh.

I'm surprised to realize that I enjoyed some other buffet places more here in Vegas, local spots that charge about $10 or so less. I didn't feel that the Wynn buffet was worth the $45 per person. It's highway robbery at its finest: I'm overwhelmed by the cost of the buffet, & underwhelmed by the quality of the food & the service.",10,7,2

We had dinner on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving which meant there was an uncharge for a ""holiday week"" buffet, even though hotel rates make it clear that business is down during the weekdays before the holiday. We didn't let that deter us and hoped for an even better buffet experience. We also added the unlimited drink option for $18 and both ordered the sparkling wine. It was slow to arrive and didn't taste especially good, but we ordered a second round and waited at the table to see what they were pouring. It was J Roget! No wonder it didn't taste great. Quite a disappointment for a high end buffet. 

Other than the shrimp, crab legs, and my husband's ribeye, little else was memorable. There seemed to be fewer options for a pescatarian and the desserts seem to have slipped in quality and variety.

Prime rib is excellent. I'm not a huge fan of prime rib cuts, but for some reason at buffets I *always* feel compelled to try it, and The Wynn buffet does an excellent job.

When I'm hungry, I get cranky especially when I have to wait long to eat. The perk of paying for VIP is the unlimited sangrias and mimosas, which is totally worth it given that you pay about $10-$12 for each glass outside of the buffet.

The selection of food is vast and mouth watering. It's also delicious as well as satisfying. I call the dessert buffet ""Diabetic Paradise"" because I can imagine developing diabetes in the future after eating every dessert offered at the buffet.

Our waiter was very nice and attentive. My husband loved the sangrias that he and Walter had consumed so much as if they were drinking water. This quality of food is very good but honestly to compare it with Navio's Sunday brunch at the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay, I would say Navio's quality is soooo much better.

Liked it alot and thought the food was fantastic.  Had to wait in line for awhile but good things come to those who wait right?  Well, there is a reason there is a long line.  I think buffets that are expensive are worth it if they give you a nice comfortable setting to sit in and offer some good eats.  Hell, when you are on vacation, you have to live it up right?  

As a local, you might not come here all the time but I think you should always treat yourself good once in a while.  Splurge a bit.  The higher than normal ceilings and their cool entrance in the middle are other things that make this place a TOP PICK in my book......",1,0,1

Many people do not like them for very reasons but I just love them.  It may be because I like to try so many different things and buffets allow me to do this all in one seating (well technically more since you go back and forth to the buffet.)  This buffet is a really good one and also had no line which was surprising although we did go a little over an hour before closing which was probably the reason.

The layout was nice with the many various stations from pasta, to carving, to salad, to desert there was something for almost everyone.  All of the food was delicious and was not old and dried out like many other buffets.  While everything was delicious and there were many choices, a lot of the choices seemed more like side dishes rather than entrees which was disappointing.  

In the end though all the food was delicious and while maybe not the best buffet on the strip it is one of the better ones.

They offer all sorts of cuisines here at the Wynn and every single one is done surprisingly well.  Great meat selection at the carving station, and the seafood selection is ample as well.  Crab legs cut in half, piles of cocktail shrimp ready for the taking, and even a nice sushi selection on the side, with hand rolls being my favorite although you gotta get it when it just comes out or else the seaweed will get soggy and that's no fun.

A good deal of grilled items, which to me shows that they are actually spending to effort to make their items, rather than taking the easy road and frying everything.  BBQ sliders, hen, grilled pork chops, and roasted fish are just a few the good ones.  As for the carving station, definitely go for the bacon if they have it.  It is just a beautiful piece of meat done right.

If you go there for brunch, there's an omelette station and once dinner service starts at 3:30pm, it turns into a made-to-order Italian pasta station.  I love the pasta there, especially when you can have it made with the ingredients you like and the sauces to go with it.  Nothing better than to sit here for 3+ hours and eat different meals all in one sitting :P 

As for the dessert selection, it beats all others as well.  Just the ice cream is a good enough reason.  Their coffee ice cream is bitter like real coffee and they offer good toppings for your ice cream.  Pile them almonds!  You can even order crepes which is just fun cause you can choose different toppings to overdose on sugar.  My favorite dessert though is the creme brulee just cause I'm a sucker for them hahah.

This buffet seriously stands alone at the top by itself.  I absolutely love coming here.  The quality is there and I really think everything is just done with much more effort.  At $30-40 it is a bit pricey and the wait can be long but hey, it's worth it.",2,2,3

Price - It's about $40 per person. Pricey for say a buffet, but really, I thought the food was really good. Roll the highlight wheel:

This was my favorite buffet this time around.  The crab legs, roasted cauliflower, pretzel bar and creme brule dessert, and spicy tuna hand roll were all very good.  The New England clam chowder was also tasty.  

The .75 star off is because, besides the hand roll, the sushi selection was terrible.  The worst of all the other buffets.  What a let down.

The oysters had a mushy mouth feel and not so great body and finish.. Slightly dejected bunch. Overall my dining experience was good, less selection than the ceasars buffet .. Never the less all buffets in my opinion have their strengths and weaknesses.

The support staff we're very nice and always accommodationg. The nice meal turned a lot less enjoyable when after returning from the restroom a manager questioned weather I was just joining the party and asked to see a receipt.  I produced the receipt and she brushed it off and now changed her story regarding a 2 hour time limit.  The elapsed time was 1 hour and 30 minutes.

I've been to this buffet plenty of times and I have never left unsatisfied. 

First off I want to say they have a pasta station where you are able to choose your type of pasta, protein, sauce and anything extra such as mushrooms, garlic, onions etc. and the chef cooks it up right in front of you. However, the last two times I have been here there was a taco station with the same concept where you are able to choose your protein, and any extra add ons. I do enjoy the taco station as well but hope the pasta station is not done for good. 
They have a great selection of seafood, Alaskan crab legs being at the top in my opinion. That are already split in half so all you need to do is enjoy and eat. And various gourmet dishes of halibut, red snapper, and much more. Great carving station where they offer nicely cooked prime rib, sausages, ham, and another selection of steak that I can't quite remember. Their asian section is on point as well and they also offer your basic but delicious foods such as mac and cheese, mash potatoes, various pasta dishes, meatloaf, chicken, pork loin, and different types of salads and soups.

Lastly, you cant forget the dessert station. I usually like to create a crepe, added with an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with some strawberries and a drizzle of nutella or some rich chocolate goodness. Their ice cream selection and texture has improved, and the only thing i think they may need to work on are their cookies? I've had plenty of occasions where their cookies are hard and not soft like how i prefer them. Hopefully it has improved since, however my last visit was in June of 2016.  As you all may know Las Vegas buffets are generally expensive and with lunch costing 26.99, I think is a nice plus added to their mouthwatering dishes.",1,0,0

- no king crab legs during lunch (only available at dinner)
- juices are all from concentrate

The floor manager was kind enough to help flag down servers who were horribly inattentive. I would be empathetic if it was Sunday brunch but on a Tuesday night... they need to get it together. 

All I really wanted was crab legs and champagne. 

Of the four legs I piled on my plate, one was completely frozen! Not to mention that the butter was scalding hot. I suffered a first degree burn trying to pour some into a container. (Slightly exaggerated but they did start pouring butter from a different container after a number of complaints.)

Champagne was a great deal at $10 unlimited for pretty good bublly but having to flag down a server every time I needed a refill was annoying. Not once was I asked if I wanted more. 

I moved on from crab to lamb chops and was pleasantly surprise. They were marinated and absolutely eat-until-you-puke delicious. I did get scolded by the chef when I accidently dropped two because they slipped out of the tongs. --Not sure what's up with the back sass but things would be better if they worked on that. Slippery food + smooth tongs = disaster.

As for the food, I really loved the variety of food they had. There was countless options! The teriyaki flank steak was delicious and the crab legs were very fresh. I just wish they included some oysters (that would have really made our day!) The dessert options were great! I loved that they had a crepe station, and all the mini desserts were delicious (red velvet cupcake, creme brulee, cheesecake). I will definitely come back again!",1,0,1

I went just at dinner opening time - 3:30pm (Sunday) and had to wait in line about 10 minutes. (Seemed like forever since I was so hungry) Dinner buffet was $39.99 and I added the all you can drink Champagne, Mimosa, Red and White Wine for $15.00. Total $55.00. I tipped the waiter at the table when almost finished with the meal. He kept my glass full even though busy (I'm sure the early tip didn't hurt). I am a meat eater so I mostly ate the Veal, Lamp and Prime Rib. All really good - especially for the price. Shrimp (very plump) and crab legs (big) were perfect as well. Tried the Seafood pizza - too fishy. Brussels sprouts good (recently discovered I really like them). Great variety of cheeses. I skipped the salad bar.

Desert was an experience. Lots to choose from and there is a chef making fresh crepes. I had read about the Creme Brulee so even though I was stuffed I was able to enjoy one to top off my dining experience.

Even for a woman dining alone I truly enjoyed myself. Requested a table out of the way and the hostess was more than happy & polite to accommodate. 

I told several business associates about this restaurant. While it may seem expensive, the variety and quality of the food makes it worth it to me.",4,0,1

People seemed to either hate, love or think that the buffets were just average. Wynn's buffet had a good amount of positive reviews and a Google search provided articles naming Wynn's buffet as one of the best in Vegas so my friend and I decided to have our Sunday brunch here. 

The line reminded me of a Disneyland roller coaster ride. We waited about 25-30 minutes in line at peak brunch hours. I'd recommend carving out time in your schedule for the wait. Once we paid, we were seated shortly after and to our liking, right next to the buffet food. The set up is very clean, organized and neatly displayed. The Wynn's buffet dining area itself is pretty gorgeous. Colorful flower arrangements descend from the ceiling and give the space a seemingly magical element. Combined with the serene music they play while you eat, you almost forget you're consuming ten thousand calories. 

So on to the food. I loved their carving board area where they serve slabs of different meats from maple bacon to prime rib to ham. The prime rib was full of flavor, perfectly cooked and very tender. Highly recommend it. They also have a seafood station. The lobster quiche stood out to me. It's served in a tiny tin pie tray and was a perfect serving amount as there is plenty more to indulge in at this buffet. 

They have a dim sum section too complete with siu mai, shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, pork and spinach dumplings, etc. I thought the quality of the dim sum was very decent. I enjoyed it. It was the best dim sum I've ever had but it was very good for a buffet. 

They have a build your porridge station. I didn't have any but my friend did and enjoyed it. They also have an omelette, crepe and sushi section. I didn't dabble in any of these but appreciated the variety that they provided. 

There was only one item out of the countless dishes I tried that I didn't like. The sangria gelee didn't really accomplish what it set out to do. I think it was going for a subtle wine-flavored jello but the alcohol was much too strong and tart. I set that one aside after one bite. 

For dessert they have a gelato station with about 10 different flavors to choose from. I was in a sorbet mood and got a scoop of mango and raspberry both of which I enjoyed. My friend and I also decided to split many of the small pastries that were offered. We both had our favorites among which were the carrot cake, blueberry lemon tart and a chocolate coconut mousse cake they have. 

For the price you pay, I felt that this brunch buffet was really solid. They have a beautiful venue, have quick and polite service and there are plenty of food options at very decent quality. I would definitely return and recommend it.",17,6,9

I feel the Wynn Buffet quality has changed over the years. They only had pork breakfast sausage which I take as a hint of reduced costs. Many of the exciting breakfast items they've had in the past which were very gourmet, are now gone. You have scrambled eggs (yellow), or scrambled egg whites. There's a carving station with Dijon ham which was nice, and somewhat unsightly heaping coils of two sausage types. There's a made-to-order pancake station where you choose red velvet, buttermilk or blueberry as a base with some general options to add. They had a smoked salmon scramble, pizza, Chinese food, unique ""hash brown"" blocks (pretty good), mini Belgian waffles, lemon ricotta blintzes, and tamarind baked fish. Salad bar is sparse with a premixed Caesar. Fruit was disappointing (bowl of grapes, cantaloupe, pineapple or honeydew) as I'm used to seeing better options at this price point of buffets (strawberries, blueberries, mangos etc?)

Dessert bar was not good with the exception of blueberry cheesecake. The cookies were hard and most of the options just weren't good. I expected Wynn to be better than Cosmo but it wasn't this time.",4,3,3

Although I'm the family member who is most willing to go out anywhere, my sister would follow only on the condition that she would go back to the Wynn Buffet. I wouldn't blame her, as on the last visit she devoured those legs of lamb by the handful. We're talking about the person who doesn't eat pork, prefers not to eat red meat and would rather stick to seafood. On the last family visit to Vegas, she kept on pestering me about coming back. Doesn't help that she's 1 year away from 21.

We checked in our hotel and out of curiosity, called the number to determine the wait time. ""2 hours"" as of 2pm Thanksgiving Day.
Me: Uh guys, we better start falling in line if we're gonna eat by 5.

When the family got to the buffet line, we noticed that it looped around once ending at the ""Mojitos"" sign nearby. It only got worse. Turns out there were 2 lines, a line to GET in the line and the actual line. Luckily, the pre-line only took about 30ish minutes. When we got to the end of the pre-line, we had an option to wait in line, or skip to the VIP line, which would only shorten our line by 20 minutes (but we get a free drink), but it would cost an additional $15\/person. The Thanksgiving dinner was already $45ish\/person. My sister timed the entire line wait to be about 2 hours and 30ish minutes, compared to the last visit was around 45ish minutes.

The dining area is very clean, on par with sit-down restaurant standards, which is saying a lot for buffets, as they usually are not.  Lots of use of floral imagery and pastels all around. We were promptly asked for our drinks. This can also be said where the food is being served. Presentation is superb for buffet food and the areas are also kept clean. The areas are segregated by type of foods, from seafoods to meats to salads. 

Right away the family went straight for the king crab legs and the rack of lamb. When I tasted the rack of lamb it wasn't the taste that I remembered, something was a bit off. I guess it wasn't as savory. My sister agreed, but still ate it anyway. At one point I was even enjoying my mashed potatoes more than that. I also got the prime rib, tastes like what I would get at a Black Angus as opposed to a real sit down place.

The tom yum soup was too watery and didn't have enough vegetables.
The pasta section was too rich for me to eat it all.

The dessert section is the nicest section of them all, a huge selection of desserts. Their warm brownie is excellent, hot and moist, went well with the vanilla gelato. Their creme brulee, was bland. A good creme brulee is supposed to have a deep custard base, I felt as if I was eating more of the sugar than custard. Bread pudding was pretty good, warm and stiff. 

Funniest part about the experience was that my sister and brother got those candied apples. It was too hard for them to directly bite into it, so they kept on tapping it with a fork. My sister got tired of it, so my brother kept on continually whacking at it for a good 10 minutes. Finally, the candied apple broke and ate it, said ""Meh"". and set it alongside the food to be taken away. 

And so I iterate this advice to all: For the money you could be spending on a nice buffet ($40ish\/person), spend it on a nice sit-down restaurant.",0,0,0

So to pay $35 for dinner and have unlimited food and drink....is not bad. 

The food was good, good selection...there was a good amount of seafood...the line leading up to the crab legs and shrimp was RIDIC. There was also delicious cooked fish, Italian food with a customizable pasta station, Asian food w\/ sushi, & salad bar available. I had a little of everything and was satisfied.

 I missed the crab legs, but considering all the other foods were delicious and the shrimp I got was super fresh and tasty, I'm SURE the crab legs were excellent.  I won't go into detail of what I got, but this buffet is HUGE.  two rooms for ONLY desserts which included home made gelato, and the buffet line is awesome.  Salad spread was excellent and so were the other entrees.  I know it might sound lame but the tastiest thing I had was their pizza! Super thin and perfect!  The hand cut bacon was bomb as well as the prime rib. 

I think they can work on their sushi and other seafood items, but other than that, it's still tasty.  I got here at a perfect time- just when brunch was ending and dinner stuff was coming out so I had the eggs, sausage and other breakfast items as well as the lunch\/dinner items.

So far this review kind of sounds like a 4 or a 4.5 star, but what tipped the scales to a full 5 stars was the fact that they had congee (chinese rice porridge) with all the fixin's including 1,000 year old duck egg.  (I know, sounds gross it's def. an acquired taste).

The title of ""best buffet"" in Vegas will always be hotly debated, but considering atmosphere, price, and food quality\/variety, I think The Buffet at the Wynn wins. The main seating area is airy, bright, and gorgeous with colorful oversized topiaries. The dessert area is equally fun and appealing. Apparently there was a chocolate fountain that I missed.

The line was somewhat substantial. There's a line to pay, followed by a line to be seated by the hostesses, all in all taking us about 30 minutes. You'd think it'd be perfect for large groups, and in some ways it is, but a group 8+ will cost you at least 18% automatic gratuity and you can't be seated until everyone has paid. We ended up splitting up into multiple smaller groups, and they very kindly seated us near one another. Their Monday night dinner buffet was around $42, tip not included, and the ""endless pour"" about $19. That's steep, but for a two-hour dinner and good service, you can get your money's worth. It is more expensive on Fri\/Sat.

The food itself is incredible! Every time I would go through the line, I'd promise myself I was going to walk the whole line before filling up my plate...but I couldn't resist. It took me about 3 visits just to work my way down from one end to the other. Each station was very hot and fresh; very little looked like it had been out under a warming light for too long. Some of my highlights:

Peking duck buns - made to order, don't miss these! They're the perfect mix of savory on a squishy little bun and topped with scallions and sauce...mmmm.
Dim sum, including the pork buns - WOW. Fatty deliciousness.
Mac and cheese - I had seconds, but we do it better in Texas.
Seafood orechietti - I enjoyed this dish. Creamy and came with in-shell mussels.
Mini creme brulee - excellent.
Gelato - served up on a rotating display! I think I had the salted caramel.

Hungry hungry YELPERS!!!!

The morning after.... scratch that, the mid afternoon after another gathering of prominent SBC outside the Wynn, the likes of which has not been seen outside of the 408. Walter had arrived earlier to better partake of the endless sangria and mimosas (I think it cost $8 for that add on). As we rolled up to the arches leading to the line for this roller coaster ride into gastronomy we were greeted with other hungry faces, pleather clad walls and a very peach paint palate that didn't do anything to help me forget about the long line that I was in. If you pay, like everywhere else in Vegas, you can skip ahead of the line and hit that buffet all the faster. 

As for the food and other offerings inside... the endless sangria is well worth it. Especially considering that 30 odd yelpers eat that much slower when they drink and make fun of each other over the things witnessed in the previous 72 hours. Hell, it seemed like we were there for almost just as much time eating, drinking, and laughing. It's no joke, if you have the determination, you too can sit there all day and gorge on the varied cornucopia of foods hailing from the ocean, oven, grill, asian, mexican, continental persuasion as well.

Let's see ... what'd I have ... The seafood and sushi was fresh and incredibly juicy (real wasabi!), the pork was obscenely savory, the lamb made a mockery of all other lamb dishes I've ever had. I loved the vegetables so much I would marry them, then I'd turn around and cheat on them -- the sirens' song of their soups cannot be denied. I was humbled by their ice cream, which they apparently make themselves, and shamed by their cakes. The decor made me feel as if I were the last in a long line of royalty. 

The only downside is that the long line of would-be royalty stretches for a really long ways, and they don't take reservations. If you've the time, wait until after 8 p.m., when the lines are more manageable -- go spend some time in the Wynn's outstanding poker room or go watch a show or something, because this buffet is definitely worth the wait.",3,4,3

The place is as beautifully decorated as before, with lovely light and bright buttercup walls.  It always feels super clean and posh. The tables and chairs\/boothes are very comfortable and the servers were attentive.

This time, we went to a weekday breakfast buffet ($20.99 pp) and despite lack of seafood (no crab nor shrimp on the Friday buffet) I enjoyed it immensely.  I knew that it it was a smaller buffet going in, so I felt fine about the other options. I did a walk by all the food to best prioritize, and am happy to report that 98% of all I tasted was great!  

Highlights that I'd recommend: 
+Smoked salmon 
+Corned Beef Hash 
+Small Fruit parfaits (one watermelon and whisky) other Caprese - delightful
+Blood Orange Sorbet!  It was so refreshing and full of intense citrus flavor.
+Dessert selection was amazing... pity I had no more room to indulge.

Interesting tastes that I'm happy I tried, but perhaps wouldn't go for again:
-Blue corn pancake with berry butter topping- healthy, but it got cold fast, even though it is made to order at the pancake station.  I'd probably go for good ole buttermilk next time - with the berry butter. 

-Candied Apple. It looks amazing - a glossy candy red apple.  But it was difficult to eat and I had to really put some effort into cutting it with my knife.  Chew with care as the candy shell is rock hard.  Hubby would have preferred a Caramel Apple.

Bottom line:  a beautiful buffet.  I'd be back anytime.",5,0,0

The food...well, the food is ""eh"" at best, and inedible at worst.  The buffet is extensive and covers nearly any palette, but because it's done in such a mass quantity and left to sit out, is not particularly fresh or hot.  The desserts mostly had a rubbery consistency, save for the tasty peach cobbler and pecan rolls.  The ice cream bar is also a very safe bet.

Steer clear of the shrimp...they were room-temperature and slimy on the skin, so we had to pass after a bite, for fear we'd get sick.  Most everything was heat-lamped too long and was too dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit at a table with view of the buffet chef - you can watch them put out new dishes and run over to get them fresh.  They won't taste delicious, but at least they'll be consumed straight-from-the-oven.

I have heard that the dinner buffet is better, but for the price of champagne brunch, I expected that the food quality would suffer, so I wasn't disappointed when this came to fruition.

However, for the $30 or whatever it was, the ability to sit in a garden-of-eden-meets-Mad-Hatter-tea-party room with the sun streaming in, nibbling some food and drinking champagne was well worth the price tag.  It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning at the Wynn.

So grab a glass, settle in, and, if you really want good food, stick to the fresh-made stations like the omelets, or just go somewhere else.",3,3,3

I really enjoyed the chicken noodle soup and the New England clam chowder.  For some reason I really enjoyed the pizza.  They tasted very fresh, and the dough was so soft, and a tad bit sweet.

There's a good variety of items here but not as much as I thought there would be. Some casino buffets in San Diego have more variety of items than here, but what they lack in variety, they excel in quality. 

There might be a ton of buffets out there that claim they have the most variety of items but the quality is horrendous! And when you take that into consideration, there's probably only a couple of things you can actually eat because everything else tastes like crap. 

Everything tastes AMAZING here at Wynn! Some of my favorites have to be the FLANK STEAK. OMG! BEST TASTING STEAK EVER!!! I couldn't stop eating it! They used really good quality foods for everything! The fruit they served had some of the best tasting pineapple I've ever had!! There's a really nice dessert section with a made to order crepe station!! For dinner there is also king crap legs that are sliced in half for you already!! You don't have to work for the meat, which makes it all the more enjoyable to eat!! 

I loved the presentation of all the food items. I tend to not eat salads at buffets but when Wynn arranges the salad in beautiful glass cups, I couldn't even resist eating some! 

Drinks are unlimited as well, so you can pick from coffee, tea, sodas, etc. 

I think lunch is around $24 and dinner is around $43 (tax included). 

The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because: 1) Lacking in variety of items (as compared to other casino buffets); 2) No watermelon (my favorite fruit); 3) No macaroons (which I saw on other yelper's pictures); 4) Our waiter changed shifts and our second waiter was really neglectful of us

And worst of all, they are extremely bad for people like me who run in there pushing down anyone in my way to get a look at the vastly large circle of food all smelling delicious and looking might good as it glistens in the light.  and go early to avoid the line.  we went at 4pm and stayed till 8pm.  Even reloaded.

As i walked passed the desserts to my table, I found myself at the center in front of the roast station with the seafood to my left and italian to my right.  It was like being a kid in a full on candy store, and knowing that I could eat as much as I want, was dangerous.

So what did I have?
- Seafood - large cocktail shrimps were a little bit tough as if they were frozen for some time, but i do like me some shrimp (the ocean called, they're running out of shrimp).  The alaskan crab was excellent and we each got a cup of butter to go with each of it.  (you'd think, a cup of butter?  is that necessary?  but its all to make it easier to dip)

- Chinese - The Siu Mai was good and the egg rolls were hard to look away from.  Normally I'd tell myself to only eat the stuff that are worth and not found anywhere else.  This rule doesn't always work.

- Roast - My FAVORITE DISH was the lamb.  I kept going back for 3rds and it makes me very happy that several pieces of this was in my stomach which made me full.  Somehow, they managed to make it very tender and it tasted like butter as you bite off the meat.  The prime rib was alright, I didn't even finish my entire piece.  skip the turkey

- Grill - the veal short ribs were another favorite of mine here.  even scored me some asparagus on the side which was nice.  The kalbi shank had a nice flavor, but still somewhat dry.

- Dessert - I think the creme brulee was well worth getting above everything. Or maybe get some fruits since if you're like me, you fear that you eat so much that my diet is going to not like me.  

For a buffet, it's definitely good, but some small things got me dissapointed.  Still worth $40 tho!",3,2,2

You will like this place if you love meat. They have so many carving stations with everything from sausage, turkey, venison, prime rib, leg of lamb, lamb chops and salmon. And that's in addition to the crab legs, kobe meatloaf, fried chicken, sea bass and dozen other carnivorous dishes that are already set out. Even my brussels sprouts had huge chunks of bacon! I made a beeline for the prime rib and it was delicious. I was tempted to go back for more, but  I decided I should try other things. I had a few crab legs because I felt obligated to, but I realized that I was really only eating the crab as a vehicle for consuming butter. 

The big disappointment though were the desserts. The dessert section is huge, but there really isn't a big variety. They have a crepe station (often unmanned) and ice cream, plus your usual suspects, creme brulee, cheesecake, etc. I much prefer the desserts at Studio B at the M.

Pizza (cheese) 7\/10
King crab (which everyone went apeshit for) 7\/10

The food: I had high hopes and was excited for a buffet. I have been to bellagio and caesars buffets previously. Me and my man started to fill plates... we didn't like anything we ate. The only thing that was good was the italian meats salami mortadella etc but still bland with just the bread... how about some tomatoes, olives etc to go with it?!

SO many things we tried and did not retry. Some things we even spat out. After about 20 minutes and the inability to make a plate of ANYTHING we liked... we started to give up. Even the pizza tasted like frozen. I liked the pizza I got at 3 AM on the strip way better. 

We went to the dessert room to find about 5 prepared desserts, ice cream, bread pudding, and that was it... SO PATHETIC for a las vegas buffet. Instead of putting desserts we looked at each other and thought how our local town buffet is even better... so disappointing.

At that point I spoke to a manager and got a full refund. We both left hungry and disappointed in the quality of the food. What vegas buffet serves fried turkey and fatty chewy hanger steak as their meat choices?? The steak was so fatty it couldnt even be chewed. BLAHHHH

SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!",0,0,0

We decided to try the Buffet at the Wynn on Saturday morning for brunch after reading all of the amazing reviews (and pictures) on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  The Wynn provided the best of both worlds - quality and a great selection.  

All of the usual breakfast items were available, including a made to order omelet station, waffles, french toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, and plenty of fresh fruit and pastry.  The hands down favorite of the group were the hot mini cinnamon rolls.  They looked like ordinary small danishes, but they were so warm, and flaky that we just kept eating more.    

Other hits included the dim sum station with delicious pot stickers, pork buns, and spring rolls.  They also had a jook bar, which was a bit bland but unique for a Vegas buffet.  There were kobe beef sliders, prime rib, pizza, sushi, shrimp cocktail, salads, smoked fish, civeche, and lots of pastas.  The desserts were great and included ice cream (scoops, not that crappy soft-serve stuff), and several small portions of various cakes, tarts, puddings, and mousses.  

I left brunch so full that I did not ever think I would eat again.  Of course I totally returned for breakfast on Monday.  The selection was smaller than at brunch, but we stayed long enough to see the lunch selection as well.  If you come around 10:30 you can pay the breakfast price ($19) and get to try lunch as well which rolls out around 11am.  A very reasonable price when considering the other dining options at the Wynn.",0,0,0

Cons: Priced at 50 usd all you can eat, you expect good food, I tried the meat except pork- overall good seasoning and everything was cooked well but, lamb was not tender and the cops had little meat in them, sea food was abundant but felt like they were not fresh, chicken was just chicken, the best would prob be the steak meat it was well cooked and warm, pork looked juicy and fresh. The sushi was very boring and did not look fresh, the Asian\/noodles bar was okish- again nothing top notch. The best part was the Dessert!!

It didn't knock my socks off especially considering the premium you pay to get in ($30-$50 depending on lunch or dinner time).  Also due to the plethora of other buffets around I wouldn't necessarily recommend this one.  

The Rio World Buffet has a larger selection, food as far as the eyes could see, dessert selection that was pretty supremo, and the food generally tasted better.  Also it is cheaper.  I'll admit the ambiance at the Wynn isn't bad, but not enough to justify the asking price and let's be honest here, you're there to shovel food down your gullet and get your body on track for diabetes. Am I right?  No? Okay I digress...

The crab legs and general seafood layout was a little smaller than other buffets. The fruit station was practically non-existent which offended the vegan half of me.  There were three kinds of lamb that practically tasted the same.  The carnivore half of me was doubly offended.  Also what happened to the mexican nacho bar where you could build your own nacho and pour on the cheese and guacamole? No taco shells?  No selection of black and refried beans?  Mais NON!  The Japanese half of me was triple offended.

So yeah, if you're looking to hit up one buffet to lock in your Vegas memories to brag to your farmer friends back in IOWA corn country, I wouldn't go to this one.  Hit up Cesar's or Rio.  

I'll give Wynn the very small benefit of the doubt in that I was there on a holiday week, but c'mon son, you gotta be on your A game especially during this time of year when people will probably be visiting.

I waited for about, oh, five minutes and my party returned. ""Where's our drinks?"" I don't know, I haven't seen our server yet, I'll go get my food.

When I get back, still no drinks. I grab our hostess and tell her we are very parched and would like some brawn-do with electrolytes. She grabs a busser and she takes our order...very suspiciously.

When the busser gets back, she just stares at everyone, you could tell she was counting. ""It says here on your ticket you have five people and I see six, did one of you sneak in?"" Are you serious? Is this why you didn't give us our drinks? We produce our ticket and show we paid for six people. The lady just nods and walks off, no apologies or anything.

I didn't even attempt to eat it, cos once I took it out of the bamboo box steamer, the soft white bread became rock hard.  The fried chicken was dry and tough, the fish was dry and flavorless.  The only things I managed to finish were the shrimp cocktails and the ribs, both of which I can name twenty other places where I can get the same or better.

Dude, I can't even remember what else I got. The sushi was lame, the the spicy tuna handroll was pretty good, and their freshly baked breads were all good.  Except you don't go to buffets to eat bread. . .that's like filling your stomach up with water!  Blasphemy!  The Italian and Mexican fare were all unmemorable and the desserts were whatever.  The bread pudding looked dry and the only dessert my bf and I managed to finish was the spiced apple walnut cake.

We're gonna try to Rio Seafood Buffet next time (we heard good things about it) or the Paris buffet (the bf remembers their kabobs and crepes with quite fondness)",1,1,1

let's start from the beginning.  oh how stoked i was to be eating at the wynn.  the hotel is beautiful...the buffet is beautiful...the whole dang place is just super expensive.  picture this...people are walking around in bath robes with glasses of champagne in their hands!

anyway, the line was pretty short when we arrived.  we got there at a perfect time...it was just short of the buffet transitioning from breakfast to lunch...so we got a little taste of breakfast...and a little bit of lunch.  in my opinion, they had 2 chances to wow me....instead...they got 2 strikes.  

breakfast:  there was a huge assortment of items from fruits to granola to oatmeal...smoked salmon benedict, crab souffle, waffles, pancakes, carved meats, other random breakfast meats, and so much more which i just can't think of right now.  haha.  all i remember...was that i barely touched my plate.  the food looked so beautiful...but the flavor just didn't cut it.  oh, and the ham had such a funky flavor to it...kinda like soap?

so how excited i was when i saw them pulling back the breakfast and going over to lunch items.  i was thinking yay...redemption!  ok, first of all, the lady behind the counter setting up the meats and cheeses was yelling at everyone that stopped waiting for the area to be set up.  ""don't touch!!""  ""wait til i'm done!!""  ""i'm not finished yet!!""  haha.  poor people...they've probably never felt so intimidated at a buffet...anyhoo, she set up a whole bread basket full of nice looking rolls, baguettes, etc...and the meats looked wonderful...the cheeses were even more appealing!  but when i took it back to the table...most of it was super dry...and old...like they sliced everything a week ago.  the bread was decent though...and all the smoked fishes were pretty ok.  once again...nothing was really memorable!

the assortment of desserts was a lot smaller than what i've seen at the other buffets i've been to...but this buffet had rice pudding which i absolutely love...so bonus to them for that.  typical gelato, tiramisu, creme brulee...

i really wanted to like this place.  so...i'm considering giving this place a 2nd try...but this time, i'd go for dinner.  the food looked too beautiful to pass by...but the flavor was so forgettable.",0,0,0

The selection is pretty nice. You have the basic cuisines, your soups and salads, and I really liked the cheese and sliced deli meats section. But beware the prosciutto is not di parma! Is that a little too much to ask for? =P

Honestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.

One cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods.

The food there could have been better overall.  The sushi was barely something memorable or more likely something one would like to forget entirely because of how mushy the rice was.  The smoked salmon was ok, but tasted way better elsewhere.  The chicken tandori was a pretty bad imitation of Indian food gone bad, since the flavor of the tandori yogurt never got past the skin of the chicken at all.  The roast beef was not as good as the lunch buffet Rio at this hour since the taste was as bland as the chicken tandori.  The beef brisket sliders composed mostly of fat with a overly oily piece of onion ring that hints at the awful tasted disguised in elegant preparation.  The BBQ Roast pork bun was a sorry excuse for Chinese cuisine because of how dry the inside of the bun was.  But the buffet did have its highlights.  The Raspberry Mango pudding was good and presentation was very good,  the tapioca mango lychee pudding was also great like a 5 start taste and preparation.  The Madelines were also fluffy and perfect.  The Eggs Benedict was medium to better then average, but local dinners would have fresher tasting Eggs Benedict with the yolk more fluid instead of already solid.  Overall if you can avoid the buffet for lunch time it would be a good idea.  For the price, it is not worth you money.  Bring your business somewhere else like the Mirage.  if anybody has had a dinner experience at this buffet please post the menu items and the highlights as well as what to avoid.  Thanks.",0,0,0

I liked that they had cured meats and cheeses. 

I also liked how they had their desserts in such cute little cups!

The general seating arrangements are pretty deceiving.  There is the gorgeous seating area built for  smaller parties of 2-4 people right behind the hostess.  But once you enter  the buffet area, you'll see the standard buffet boothes, chairs, and not-so elegant furniture compared to what had greeted you.  The food itself is stretched alongside what looks like a long hallway.  From cold seafood like crab legs to cooked seafooed like steam mussels...you'll find many options in-between from asian, italian, american classics like prime rib and mashed potatoes, to pizza.  There is definitely something for everyone if you also consider the pasta bar, bread, bar, and soup bar.

And the desserts, not as extensive as their food offerings, but still a good number of things to choose from including ice cream and crepes.  I definitely enjoyed every bite and also go my money's worth.

The only thing I found distasteful, was the hostess.  She was extremely unpleasant and not seeming to want to extend any form of hospitaility towards us whatsoever.  We were a party of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes just to get a table.  I understand that there just may have not been a table of that size ready, but she didn't even care to explain what was going on or offer an estimated wait time.  In one word, she was just flat out rude.  And I know it wasn't us, because at one point, another patron came to our table and said she was glad we finally got seated, because the hostess clearly didn't seem like she wanted to help.  Sigh.

I guess now I really have to try out the Bellagio buffet on the next trip out there, and hopefully the food and the service will be great.

Our actual waitstaff, they were excellent though.  Just like the food.

PS:  For a buffet, I wouldn't consider this spendy, but that's how the Yelp price categories are defining it, it was like $35 per person.",1,0,1

The greatest thing about this buffet is that every single dish tastes unique and incredible.  Fine rare spices must be being used in all of the dishes.

It has everything you'd expect from a high priced buffet in a 5 diamond hotel, so there's no reason for me to reiterate. Yet, every now and then this place surprises me and comes out with a dish or two that I find myself get seconds and thirds and fourths for. But in general, the over food here I find less appealing than Bellagio. I mean, either place you decide to eat  at would be a win-win situation, it's just that you'd win more at Bellagio. Maybe you should take this coke vs. pepsi challenge and deside for youself. I prefer coke, and Bellagio is my coke...in a tall glass with ice on a hot summer day.

Quick summary:

Too many choices? Just focus on these three items: prime rib, Alaskan crab legs, and Asian food (e.g. Shrimp bao, fried dumpling, leek cake).

My no-no list: beef slider, rib-eye (just get more prime rib), madeleines, creme brulee

---

Holiday dinner price was $47.99 and the wait felt like forever ... had to wait about 90 ~ 120 minutes. 

Plate #1 (Sushi, seafood, and Asian food) - Shrimp bao (I liked the sweet bun), fried dumpling (very impressive, one of the top fried dumplings I've had), leek cake (flavorful), spicy salmon hand roll (a bit disappointed, it didn't hit the spot), BBQ eel nigiri (above average quality for a buffet), California roll (above average quality for a buffet), and Alaskan crab legs (already sliced open, juicy and flavorful)

Plate #2 - medium rare prime rib (expect a long line, one of the best prime rib I've had - tender, juicy, and irresistible), lamb chop (tasted a bit dry), bratwurst (not bad at all), chicken sausage (not bad at all), mashed potato, ham, beef slider (terrible bun and dry meat, could not finish it), rib eye (did not like it, tasted pretty dry), asparagus (juicy and crunch, good), green bean casserole

Plate #3 - baked salmon, orecchiette pasta basil pesto & grilled Mary 's chicken. four cheese ravioli, chicken parmesan roll (all plate #3 tasted pretty decent)
 
Plate #4 - creme brulee (sugar crust didn't taste right), tiramisu (excellent), madeleines (didn't like the texture), cream puff (good), gelato (chocolate peanut butter and cappuccino) 

Plate #5 - fried rice (not bad for a non-Asian buffet), Caesar salad (gotta eat some vegetable right?), Kate & Jicama salad (candied walnuts, grapes, blue cheese & raspberry vinaigrette), green apple salad (crunch, crunch, crunch ... yummy), fried tofu

Did not try: customized pasta station, cold cut bar (cheese, salami, prosciutto, etc), pizza (there was steak & egg pizza), and artisan bread station.

I wish there are more ice cream flavors. Anyhow, I would return if I don't have to wait for more than one hour again. And this time ... I'll only focus on prime rib and crab legs.",1,0,0

I seriously think that they made the best omelet for breakfast.  Prime Steak and Tender Lambs chop are also the best. The deserts are killer.  It's everything you will be imagine when you get there.

We've been to other buffet around vegas before, like the one in rio and excalibur (i was too small back then to remember or review so next time) but yeah so this would be my first vegas buffet review.

So for dinner on a wednesday was 35 dollars per person. They had different types of food like asian, italian, indian, american, and DESSERT! The asian selection was eh...nothing special, the italian section was pretty cool cuz there's this guy there that could cook your food or you can just grab the ones that are already cooked on the side. The indian selection had hummus and some pita bread i think and curry salmon i think (soo good), Mash potato were awesome and some random meat and game. They had this pork slice which i liked but i didn't want to try other meats because some of them were really red. They had cool salad selections in a cup or you can make your own which was awesome!

Oh the crab legs or lobster legs or something were okay, they were cold though....i usually like them hot but my mom said only asian buffet serve the legs hot. DARN! 

But the ultimate winner for me was the dessert area. OMG did i get every freaken thing in the area...well not everything but i think 70% lol.

I think since the reviews were low in the past, the Wynn upped their game because one of the patrons told us that this buffet has improved a lot in recent time. This was our first time so we went in with little to no expectations (especially after our disappointing experience at Wicked Spoon the previous day). 

Raise the roof for red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, rib eye, and surprisingly dim sum. I was a little wary to try dim sum from the buffet, but it was Cantonese restaurant, pushed from a cart, quality! 

Their chocolate fountain is beautiful to just watch and their desert bar is full of goodies that didn't disappoint. I know some people said that their crepes were so-so. I tried one for the sake of trying and I thought it was delicious. Compared to a lot of specialty crepe restaurants, this was just as good. Light, buttery and with fresh ingredients inside. 

If you have room, it sounds simple, but their fresh squeezed juices are all delicious. We noticed that some of the flavors were in and out of rotation (we're assuming based on the availability of freshness?) but each one was delicious.

So yea, after having scrolled through the Yelp reviews, it's kind of low- but those are old. Try it again and see if it's gotten better!",1,0,0

We went on a weekday for lunch, so there was no line. The decor in the place is really beautiful and airy; reminded me of an upscale English cottage with the color scheme. Although it's a buffet, you still get table service (for drinks and such), so you'll have to tip extra if you do actually order something. 

The food itself was ok, but lacking something in my opinion. We scoured the pictures on here before coming and it all looked amazing. While the food all looked pretty and there was a large selection to choose from, it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. I'm more of a quality over quantity kind of person. Of course, I still ate enough to feed an army. Hey, it's a buffet. 

Lunch on a Monday ran about $50 for the two of us. Add $10 drinks each with tip for the table service, it was too much for a Monday buffet lunch. It was a nice experience and left us in satisfying food comas, but I'll probably try a different buffet next time I'm in town.",1,0,0

Don't drink too much, and avoid carbonated beverages. It just takes up too much room in your stomach. Choose carefully, chew methodically, and swallow purposefully. 

Unfortunately, sometimes no matter how slowly you eat, you still get a severe case of the tummy ache. Layer atop layer, sometimes the order in which you eat the food could have an adverse effect on your digestive system. Would it be wise to follow up that corn chowder with a cream-filled chocolate cupcake? Shrimp cocktail after ambrosia salad? Again, choose wisely.

We came for dinner, paid lunch prices, and headed straight for the crab. I was a bit disappointed in the crab meat, or lack thereof. They were no different in size than other places like the Spice Market buffet. Some other notable items were the fish dishes like the sea bass and salmon. I had one slice of dry prime rib, and I honestly don't remember eating anything else. 

The creme brulee was my favorite dessert, but the fruit was very dry and not sweet at all. The gelato that they scooped for you melted faster than the Wicked Witch of the West. And no soft serve machine? I was sad, so very very sad.",4,3,4

Now let me tell you..this place is definitely worth the wait. As for the $50 price tag? Not so much, unless you really really love crab legs. I'd come here again if I got another free dinner or if someone I knew wanted to eat at a buffet in Vegas. (I generally really don't like buffets..not at all actually.)

This is definitely one of the better buffets in Vegas. As far as how it compares to the Bellagio, I'd say that the Bellagio definitely has more to choose from, but the Wynn is very original and creative. You get more bang for your buck at the Bellagio.

Let's see if I can remember what I ate..crab legs. Well, of course they were frozen, but they did a good job at hiding the frozen taste. Some type of lobster pasta..OH MY JESUS, this was the most awesome pasta I've ever ever ever had. Their lobster bit was ok, pretty plain. I also had 3 different salads, all of which were excellent. I had a few other dishes don't remember what..but dessert was all whatever. Okay I guess, nothing really memorable. Creme brulee, not so great. They put too much sugar on top. (I tried 3 different batches of it because I was convinced that the next batch would be better..and it wasn't. They just want you to have diabetes!)

-Pancakes
-Omelets

Okay, so that's my favorite part. Comfort food - there is no rhyme or reason.

The first time we came here about 5 months ago, we stayed at Vdara and decided to earn our meal by making the walk to the Wynn. It was FAR. But it had rained the night before and the weather was cool so the walk was pleasant. By the time we got to the buffet, I was so hungry, I would've eaten a shoe. Mission accomplished!

Went again this past weekend but this time, we monorailed it (yeah, I just verbed it... or gerunded it) to Harrah's and walked the rest of the way. Still far! Stupid Wynn. 

There's a good selection of food from roasts, ribs, american, Mediterranean, sushi, ceviche, salads, soups, desserts, etc. 
If you come here looking for some standout item - there really isn't one. But I appreciated the consistency for ALL of the items.

And in terms of weekend brunch prices, right on par for what you get. Bottomless champagne for an additional $7? Aint nothing wrong with that.",0,0,0

Over all this place sucks in my humble opinion. I came here for one thing - seafood! I ended up eating more as I will write about. 

The crab is served all cold. They slice everything in half the long way. To be honest I miss the stone age feeling of ripping the limbs apart and hearing that perfect snap and having the joy of a perfect piece of crab coming out in one piece. Do you know how that perfect crab tastes? You know the natural salty sweetness I am talking about!! The same with those perfect shrimps! Well you won't find them here!!! Oh the horror of it! The crabs were so salty that I even went as far as opening up my Netflix app on my iPhone and was going to cancel taping anymore Deadliest Catch episodes! This seams to be done on purpose. I have NEVER had crab that salty before. Not even at those cheap Chinese restaurants that want you to stop eating were that salty!! What about the shrimp you ask?? Well you should have forgotten about that! It was quite the opposite! No taste at all! Why bother getting cholesterol when there is no taste?!?!?!?

So now out of desperation I decided to try other food. At first glance this place truly has nice food sex appeal. You food lovers know what I mean! When I decided to delve a little more into what there was and how it tasted - ugh! 

They have chicken soup here. If your mama made soup like that - well my advice would be to get a new mama! Next was deep fried chicken which was battered with Matzo of all things. It was not too bad. Then again even Old Country Buffet can make a half way decent piece of deep fried chicken. The seaweed salad was a little on the sweet side but ok. The vegetable rolls were sort of crunchy, oily mush - yuck!!!

Someone wrote nice things about the Black Angus Burger?? Really?? REALLY?? R E A L L Y!!??!!?? You need to come to Buffalo and I can send you to a nice pub that would rock your world if that is how you think! That poor cow died for this! I am guessing it may of had Alzheimers and Mad Cow disease and did not even know it was cattle in the first place.  In case there is a lawyer reading this I AM JOKING! Jeez! 

I just spent $43.23 (w\/tax) and am starving! So I went to the salad bar to have Caesar Salad - at least that is what they call it on the name tag. I think I wrote enough for now. Just go somewhere else and spend the money. Either that or put it all on #24 and wish for the best!!!",1,2,1

And especially at $43. per person I would have walked by in a flash.  However, I will say that this buffet is quite amazing.   The decor is a bit over the top Disneyesque kiddy land,  It feels like an Alice in Wonderland set on steroids, and probably more cafeteria than restaurant.  Overall not very sophisticated.

The variety of food was amazing, startling in fact....from sushi to ribs to pasta dishes.  I checked it out and to my utter surprise found oysters on the half shell!! Alright!!  That won me over right there and even justified the price, had I paid. Not the most wonderful oysters I ever har, but satisfying nonetheless.  
I then had some soup, and hit the salads...very good.  Most of the salad choices were varied and delicious, a meal in themselves.

I then went back for some fish, ribs, and this wonderful looking lamb in quinoa.   All, except the rib, were delicious.  The rib was just too big, bulky and more bone than meat.  At first the vegetable choices seemed broad and varied, but on second check, not so much. I had some beans and a couple other roasted things.

My downfall was going back for a third plate. Ridiculous,  yet I wanted to try things (thinking about how much waste must go on here!).  So I went for some sushi, Asian dishes and tried the potato latkes with beef.  The latkes were not so good, greasy and the meat was not easy to eat, tough.

Finally I wandered the magnificent and incredibly varied dessert area.  My goodness, you could die right there.  I was so overstuffed that I just tried a small creme brulee thing, very good.  I have to say that the dessert display is very impressive.

2 stars for the food...it looked good, but the taste just wasn't all that. It was edible, but not great by any stretch of the imagination. If they perhaps made less stuff, but made it better, I would have liked it better.
Also 2 stars for value...$21 for breakfast? $26 for lunch? $32 for brunch? Our meal there was comped because of the package deal I got, but if I had paid full price for it I think I would really have been disappointed in the quality.

3 stars for decor...the garden area is beautiful...also 3 stars for variety...even if the taste was not amazing, at least there was plenty to choose from, and again, nothing I tried was BAD, it just wasn't all that great, either.

The best thing I had was probably the pancakes and fried chicken, both of which I actually enjoyed (together!) The prime rib wasn't bad, though somehow I had the misfortune of ending up with a sort of medium-well slice, but my husband's was medium-rare and looked pretty good.

Hungry? Just go here.  It's one of the better buffets on the strip.

I will spend a little more time talking about my general take on it.

LOCATION:

The Wynn casino seems a bit further out (especially if you are walking around) from what I call the ""heart"" of the Vegas strip (Bellagio, Ceasers, Paris) so if you are closer to the Bellagio, then I really don't think there are that many differences when it comes to the food.

What is nice about the Wynn is that I think that there is generally less traffic at the Wynn compared to the Bellagio and the buffet location is tucked away further from the casino floor traffic.  This isn't to say that there isn't a line, but there are few casinos that don't.

FOOD:

Multi national cuisine (but it slants on the side of having a lot more Asian dishes). but there are enough options for even the most picky eaters (meat and potatoes kinda people).

Desserts are fancy to look at and don't be ashamed that your plate has 6 types of desserts.....EVERYBODY is loading up.

CATTLE LINE?:

Unlike the lines waiting to get into the buffet, you don't necessarily feel that way when you go to each station to get your food.  It's pretty open and I never feel like I am queuing up.

WANNA EAT CHEAP?:

Worried about how much your meal is going to be and feel like winning some money that will take less than 3 minutes of gambling time (minus the cash out at the casino cage?)

Forget the slots, forget blackjack....I'm talking QUICKER....your are frickin' hungry, man.

Here is what I usually do.

Go to the ""money wheel"" on the casino floor. 

Put $20.00 on number ""1"".  Win?  Get 20.00 bucks profit.
(it usually hits more often than not.  You get even money back.  Don't focus on what you could win, you goal is to double up your money).

Lose?  Put 40.00 down and go again.

Bam....your buffet is now half price!

Wanna get your buffet for free?  

Press you bet on 1 again.  Win?  You got your meal paid for, son.

There you go...you either saved 50% or a full 100% of your meal ticket.

If you strike out, don't worry...you were gonna blow that money anyways.  

The upside is that it will give you even more motivation to eat as much as you can to get your money's worth.",1,4,1

After trying a handful of different buffets in Vegas, the only two that I allow myself to go to these days are at the Wynn and Rio. 

Both will give you an abundance of fresh, delectable seafood -- from shrimp cocktails and oysters to king crab legs and more!

Rio will always be the original seafood buffet, but Wynn will definitely wow you with more exquisite embellishments and luxury.  The minute you walk in, your breath is taken away by their high glass ceilings and pillars of flowers, plants, and fruits.  

What wins me over at the Wynn is their dessert section.  There are very few places where you'll find ginormous chocolate covered strawberries, candy apples, gelato, and various froufrou-looking desserts all in the same room.

Plus, I went on a Friday night with my family (weekends are supposedly the best time to go for dinner), and the selection was not very impressive. 

First off, the food is not hot enough! Maybe the heat lamps need to be changed or they need to change their methods to keep the meals warmer.. Nevertheless, by the time I sat down, everything on my dish was cold. The New England chowder would probably be more enjoyable if it was steaming the way soups should be.

There's also a pitiful selection to choose from compared to most buffets on the strip. They need to add more variety of options. 

Honestly, the M Buffet is far better. I know it's quite a trek, but I'd say it's worth it.",1,0,0

I have now been here three times and each time had a great dining experience. The price per person is just under $40, but this is for all you can eat-- and with quality food, so in my book a great deal. We usually stay for a few hours around lunchtime so it ends up being the main meal for the day. Bottomless mimosas\/cocktails are for 2 hours for an additional $19 per person. If you are able to throw at least two back this can be a great deal. 

One thing my friend pointed out this last visit is that there is not much of an ethnic variety in food (no latin dishes that we noticed) but rather American or Asian cuisine. It is set up to have both breakfast items and heavier lunch\/dinner items. But save room for dessert! There is a beautiful dessert display with great gelato, so grab a small cone on the way out!

Expect to be in line and wait for a table for about an hour-- more if it is during a busy time. Minus one star, because I feel like the lines could be better organized.

Everything was fresh and the dining experience was surprisingly wonderful. You would never really know it was a buffet because the food isn't sitting in a chafer and the staff are always nearby tossing and preparing for your enjoyment. 

Now, the food is just good and the dining experience is poor. People are packed in like sardines and tables are being bussed with tubs and trays all around you. It is difficult to get service if you need something, like a refill on your iced tea. Because of tourism, you also tend to experience the families that allow their children to run amuck so they can relax for a minute or two. I see this all too often - so I believe it must be the parents belief that the children are also on vacation - ""So let them run and have fun!""

There are no lines during the week but I only have weekends due to no vacation at work. The reason for the average stars is because they got cheap, no, not the prices, the offerings. I understand they can't do all real flowers all the time in that quantity, so they got the fakies. It's still lovely don't get me wrong, but I miss the scent of fresh flowers in the air. If we must live with it we will survive. But skimping on the buffet!??! What is that all about!??! They use to offer crab legs at lunch, now they only offer them for dinner. For $26 before tax I want my crab! Dinner is $40 except for Fri and Sat nights when it was $44 and marked as ""gourmet"" versus just dinner. There are other spendier items removed from the lunch buffet, but I forgot what they were. Apparently dinner use to offer lobster but no more. Sadness! 

Now I get there are some opportunists eating 20 crab legs at once. That's wrong and selfish.  What about putting a limit on the amount of crab and lobster any one person can get whilst keeping the rest buffet style? Sure it sounds cheesy but it would be easy to keep track of if people had tickets or something? I guess I'd rather have some than none at all, and I am one of those people who eat very little at a time, believe me, I don't ever get my money's worth, even at Izzy's lol. Anyway, the rest of the food was pretty good. The desserts were so perfectly hand crafted, almost too pretty to eat, most were good. 

I think they can add a pretty waterfall or something to make the elegant brightly lit flowery atmosphere even more gorg, like they do at some nice Indian restaurants.

Everyone's got a strategy for buffets, and mine is to hit the proteins big time and not filling up on liquids and rabbit food, I mean salads and stuff. Asian food ain't their speciality either, so skip it and go to Chinatown unless you wanna occupy stomach space with supermarket sushi,  so-so dim sum and very bland ramen. Well, we must've lucked out because on our first trip to the buffet, Stone Crab Claws were staring us in the face, So I piled 'em high with some Shrimp Cocktail and got down and dirrty!

By the time we were ready for round 2, they were already switching out the Sunday Brunch items for dinner, which starts at 3;30pm. Stone Crab Claws were gone(sad face) but was replaced by King Crab instead(happy face!) so I decided to surf and turf the next round with some peppered maple bacon, a HUMANGOUS BBQ Beef Rib, a few slices of a Tomahawk Ribeye, and a mountain of King Crab Legs. :0

Another reason you need to save some stomach space is their wide variety of sweets!
Made to order crepes, cobbler, bread pudding, mini desserts and dessert cups, candies, and a carousel of ice creams and sorbet make for a perfect finish for your buffet experience. I liked the Guava Panna Cotta, Cracker Jack Cake, S'mores Tart, and the Ice creams I got.

Sushi?  Blech - avoid this stuff like the plague.  I had a hand roll that tasted like someone wiped their ass with it before giving it to me.

Crab legs and shrimp?  If you can get some before the throngs of folks rape the display and leave nothing but sad broken husks, then by all means, go for it - but only if you like chilled crab.  The drawn butter is clean though so that was a plus but it still wasn't enough to offset the crab legs.

Prime rib?  So-so.  Trying to get a thick slice from the carver requires the Rosetta Stone program and then on top of that - they have nothing below medium on most trips.  Man - I want that stuff bleeding on my plate!

Dessert?  Ok.  It's hard to screw up dessert.  Thankfully this was the one redeeming part that allowed me to walk out and think three stars when I was ready to give two.

First of all, what happened to the amazing shrimp?  Oddly, counter space at the Chilled Seafood station - as were many stations - was taken up by huge bowls of apples.  Was this a ploy to fill in the gaps while cutting back on the amount of food?  The meat station offered flank steak and ribs.  Period.  Many items were just plain bland.  And the desserts - what few were offered - were no better than supermarket or Cool Whip-based quality.  At these prices, the Wynn has sorely lost its gourmet status.

Throughout our Vegas trip we have been making our buffet rounds up and down the Strip and was able to compare each with all prior meals. The Wynn buffet can almost be described as one grand delicious edible work of art. From the neatly arranged dinning set to the colorful decor and art work throughout, the dinning area exudes opulence and good taste (intended pun). From the well prepared, albeit limited, salad section to the flavorful meats carving station, one can quickly tell that this is no ordinary dinning option, not even by Vegas standards. Highlights include the vegetarians cerviche, peking duck, tender ribs, and crab legs and dungeness crab claws (dinner time dinning). My personal recommendation is to be still your beating heart (and rumbling tummy) and pace yourself. Go for smaller plates, sampling each of the fine dishes then circling back on some unforgettable favorites second, third, fourth, or even fifth time around. However, we live in an imperfect world and even the Wynn buffet is no exception; basic wine is not included unlike Cravings at the Mirage. However, not all is lost as we quickly rebound to the dessert area where one can find exceptionally well prepared restaurant quality cr√®me br√ªl√©e, soft cheesecake, and a most interesting (in a good way) dessert cup topped with edible gold leaf.

If you don't like to eat, don't come here and save your money. When you line up to get in, there are two lines. There's the regular joe line and there's the VIP line. The VIP line is always shorter and they don't have to wait as long. When you get to the front of the line, you pay and then you have to wait for the hostess to find you a table for your group. Once you're called, you're lead in, you order your drinks and then you head to the stations. 

The atmosphere is nice here so you can sit back, relax and pig out. 

My friends and I usually roll up here around 5:30-6:30pm and we get here right before the mad dinner rush. The items that are served include seafood (aka crab legs), Asian cuisine, Mexican, American, a Dessert station, and the Italian station. There's pasta, sushi, salad, etc. There's pretty much everything you would find in a buffet at the Wynn Buffet. 

Those Kobe Beef Sliders are what gives this the edge up over other buffets. Also, the gold flakes on the desert are a top notch way of showing that you're eating at a place that is fancy. 

The only downside is their bathrooms. C'mon you have a huge buffet and the smallest bathroom! I guess they don't want you to go to the bathroom in order to clear out to eat more and this is their subtle way to funnel you out of the buffet.

It's a $36ish meal. I expect great things from a meal that expensive, and the Wynn buffet gets close, but falls short.

To set the mood here, I went with a group of 7 at about 9:15 PM during the week. The place had no line, and was fairly not busy inside. It closes around 10:00 for reference.

The service was ok. It took our waitress forever to get us drinks and refills, as well as clearing plates. And considering she only looked to be serving 3 tables, it was frankly kinda annoying. 

The tap water, like all water in Vegas, tastes god awful. 

The food, overall, is very good and very high quality. The prime rib was superb, and surprisingly even stuff like their pizza was great. The desserts were very good but extremely sweet. I don't eat the crab legs, but my fiancee found them to be mediocre, having them already broken open and served ice cold.

I can't really recommend this for the full price, nor if there's an hour wait as some reviews suggest. As this was comped to me by my company, and I didn't really have to pay for it, I can't complain, but this clearly isn't a $36 meal.

I haven't been to other buffets on the strip so I can't compare the quality of its food. I wish there was a larger variety for the salads, but I guess their specialty lies in the meats and seafood. I forgot what the dish was called, but it was basically roasted vegetables\/potatoes that were very yummy

My favorite was the Alaskan crab legs, which were very juicy and sweet. .. Although the different types of fish were kind of dry and not tender at all, I did enjoy the rotisserie chicken. I also tried a ravioli filled with pumpkin, which was like pumpkin pie in the form of an entree--pretttttyyyyyy good! I also recommend the shrimp and cocktail sauce. Don't get the sushi because it's just rice and vegetables, without any raw fish from what I saw. If you want to get your money's worth, eat all the meat\/seafood you can instead of the filling carbs and such unless it's good pasta. 

As for dessert, the crepes used canned strawberries and blueberries so they didn't taste as fresh. The creme brulee, pistachio macaroon, strawberry champagne cup (not sure what it's called) were superb. The mini red velvet cupcakes had glitter on their perfect dollop of cream cheese frosting, but it was only good aesthetically speaking--the cupcake itself was too dry for my taste :(.

           We stayed at Wynn, so decided to come here for their special Thanksgiving dinner, since my parents & my brokis family are here with me. $57.95 for the VIP package which included 2 glasses of Champagne, so we went for it.

          What a mistake, it was 4 hours wait for the regular, and even we have the VIP pass, still 2 hours wait! WTH! So I waited with my little nieces, with my iPad in hand & ordered 2 drinks, before my family came down to join.

           The turkey was dried, the rack of lamb was overcooked. The Japanese station, no sashimi, no nigiri???? WHAT? The dessert station doesn't offer no sugar-free selection as the Bellagio buffet would have a ton!

         The prime rib, the King Crab legs and the Italian were the saver of it all. For $60 & 2 hours wait, I didn't feel like a VIP at all, but cheated!

What more can I say.  The variety is lacking compared to the Bellagio Buffet.

We ate here twice.  Once for breakfast\/lunch and once for dinner.

We came in between breakfast and lunch and had a chance to sample both.  The food was generally unremarkable.  Eggs Benedict was over cooked.  The poached egg on the benedict was over hard and should be over easy to over medium.  Some of lunch items: Grilled steak was over cooked to medium well.  Pork chop was dry.  Pad Thai was bland.  Dessert tasted like it was cooked a couple of days ago.  Pizza was awful.

Went for dinner the next night in hopes that things would get better.  The prime rib was excellent.  It was cooked medium  rare like traditional roast beef.  For those who need it more cooked, you can ask the grill master to cook it some more.  The alaskan king crab was ""okay"".  Not the best.  When you have gone to Alaska (like we have), every experience is just disappointing.   Salmon was  dry and over cooked.  New England Clam Chowder was pretty good with lots of clam.  Rack of lamb was over cooked to well done.  Rule number 1 of rack of lamb:  It must be medium rare.

Then we noticed some of the same things from lunch.  Pork chop again?  Asian station looked exactly the same?  Same pizza?  Same pasta? Same chicken?

I did notice a cheese station that was a nice touch and their mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil were AMAZING (I still think about them to this day!).

Our total was about $55 because we opted to do the $16 all you can drink mimosas (and wine, bud light, and sangria)... it is totally worth it, especially since the single drinks are so expensive anyways... and our server KNEW to keep filling them up! They were never empty!

The food is great, we did a walk through first to see what all they offered, which I highly recommend...you can methodically plan how you will fill your tummy to oblivion!

  - Mini bagels with cream cheese and lox (capers, tomatoes and other fixens available)
  - Cocktail shrimp
  - Sushi (California and veggie were offered)
  - Enchiladas
  - Pancakes with strawberry butter (make your own station with tons of toppings)
  - Cheese blintz (with strawberry sauce... to die for!)
  - Bacon (they had regular homestyle bacon and a huge slab that they cut from)
  - Ice cream (Espresso all the way!)
  - Cream puffs
  - Mimosas (like I said they were never empty and we drank a ton of them!)

Only two complaints...Skip the mac n cheese... although I do love the stuff, it just tasted like Stouffer's, also the greek salad would have been good if they didn't put lettuce in it (like a traditional greek salad is just veggies and cheese) the lettuce was soggy and not appetizing.

I had a wonderful experience at the Buffet, mainly because I went off season, and the only people around were some computer\/tech guys around for a convention.  I sat right in the middle of the beautiful ""outside"" seating area, where there are HUGE colorful fruit pieces of art hanging from the ceiling and HUGE fruit centerpieces for each table.  If you sit there, you have easy access to the dessert area, so this was the prime place to be!  Note, there's limited seating in this area, so you gotta ask the hostess if you can sit there.

There's a wide selection of different types of food, but what makes the Wynn Buffet stand out is the dessert area!  Especially the make-your-own-gelato sundae!

The crab is good here because they're already split in half for easy access and they serve it with clarified butter. The braised veal short ribs are killer and are often skipped so make sure you don't pass these up. The prime rib was juicy but since they do huge batches, the juices can seep out and the meat can get cold. The lamb was good also but make sure you eat it with the mint jelly. Their asian section was surprisingly very very good. The dim sum they had was as authentic as any buffet would ever get them, they also had a rice porridge\/congee bar.

I don't know if it's just the Wynn but wth?

Really it's freaking 100 degrees outside and you expect him to wear a shirt with sleeves? This isn't fine dining, it's a freaking buffet and it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon. What happens if we waited in line for an hour and then by time we get to the front you turned us away? that wouldn't have been nice at least it was quiet. But seriously, if you can come in into the hotel like that then you can go into the buffet like that..I can understand other restaurants but a buffet???

Come here prepared:  have an enema the night before, come starving, wear loose comfortable clothing, pray that the line isn't long, fork over the $37 for dinner, (or better yet come at 3:00pm and pay the lunch price and stay for dinner)  request to be seated in the Atrium (ambiance at a buffet place? yes!) and when the hostess leads you to your table, do you even sit down and take a moment?

No. 

I'm here with two objectives: get my money's worth and to not fill my stomach with useless calories.   Here's how I do it.

#1.  Glass of water is all you need to lubricate the stomach lining and get everything going.  Soda, juice and the like are just empty calories.  

#2.  My first plate at a buffet is always, always seafood.   You came here for the plump shrimp and tender split king crab legs, remember? they also have warm butter for your dipping pleasure. 

#3.  I skip the bread basket.  And the rice.  These take up so much room in your stomach.  Although I'll take some type of carb with my cheese plate or a small baguette with my soup.

#4.  I skip the salad too.  Again, takes up too much space in your tummy.  Pop a vitamin pill instead. 

#5. When you get sushi or any of the hand rolls, eat the filling. Dump the rice. Wasteful? yeah. Again, see reasons #3 and #4. 

#6.  Get a small slice of prime rib. It was decent.  I tasted a portion from my partner's plate.  

#7.  The ceviche station is incredible.  The Charcuterie and cheese station even better. 

#8. I grab every single mini-dessert possible and take a bite of each.  The cream puffs are not the best, chocolate frosted strawberry cake ok, espresso panna cotta yummy.  There's also an ice cream and crepe making station.  What?!  I have Yelp duties to fulfill!

#9. Rest and repeat.  

What's your strategy?",40,45,31

That being said, my boyfriend was moving back to Chicago and he wanted to do something ""Vegas"" before he left. That led us to Wynn Buffet. 

They recently put 3.5 million dollars into the buffet, and just like everything else at Wynn, it's beautiful! It's like you are dining in the Conservatory - tons of flowers and bright colors.

We were there on a Tuesday night around 5:30pm and it was PACKED! The hostess stand was a bit disorganized and had issues getting people sat in a timely manner, although there were plenty of open tables. Luckily, we were in the invited guests line and didn't have to wait too long.

They must have seen us fat kids coming and sat us at a two top near the food. Haha.....There is SO much food, and much of it isn't your typical buffet fare. They had duck buns, a live ramen station and a street taco station. That is in addition to the typical seafood (king crab legs split in half for you), sushi and prime rib. They also had a small salad bar (I skipped this), a cheese\/charcuterie area and pizza, among other things. I think the desserts are where they really set themselves apart. I mean, they had EVERYTHING! Gelato, cookies, cake, etc. And the best part - crepes made to order!

They also offer alcohol, as is the Vegas way! They have a la carte drink items or a ""bottomless"" option. The bottomless option was $18 and included one of my favorite beers, so I went for it. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Our server was fast and friendly and the food was tasty. Although my BF pointed out that I probably didn't eat enough to make it worth while.... If you enjoy buffets, this is probably the best of the best and you should try it out. Just be prepared to wait in line and you might also want to wear stretchy pants!",4,2,2

Lunch for two on a Tuesday came out to be a total of $58 and some cents. We got there around 2 pm, there was no line.

First of all, the inside of this place is just absolutely beautiful. There's lots of seating and LOTS of food. 

Their salad station was boring. They didn't have any salad toppings except Parmesan, croutons, and bleu cheese. Their dressings are house made though which is a pro on my list. I tried the balsamic, yum. They don't have any fruit except cantaloupe and honeydew. They did have a small plate of a watermelon feta salad - I did eat it. It was plain and simple. They have 3 different soups. I'm sure they switch it up all the time but the best one there was Chicken Noodle Soup - again, boring. They had an assortment of cheese and meats. Yummy and fresh. 

A lot of the food could have been better if it wasn't sitting out so long. There was a lot of stuff to try but nothing that was a m a z i n g. They had some cook to order stations like tacos, Korean pancakes, dumplings etc. but the chefs were missing at all of them :\/ another customer asked for the taco chef and since she was there we tried the ribeye tacos and my boyfriend liked them. 

I was disappointed in the Tri Tip steak, it was so dry and I think they forgot to season it! Also, there was no cup for the au jus? 

The end of the buffet is a Japanese Sushi station. There is seaweed salads and such with a variety of different sushis. Tried the smoked salmon and it was good.

The fried chicken was crusted with something wonderful, I forgot what it was called but I liked it a lot. 

Their desserts were so unique, so many things I've never seen or heard of... they all sounded and looked so delightful but none of them were... I took a second bite out of the raspberry cone and that was about it. Nothing else was worth the calories. Luckily they had a (literal) wheel of ice cream with lots of yummy flavors. I chose Matcha green tea - YUM. Boyfriend chose mango sorbet which tasted exactly like the Tropicana mango juice, IMO.",1,1,1

I do not do a lot buffets because I am not great at self control, so when I want to do a buffet, I wanna DO a buffet. I wanna do it hard.

No reservations--fine. We arrive, we are a large group of I think 8, maybe 10. We are told by the greeter at the end of the line that it will be a 45 minute wait. We are kind of bummed, but whatever. I go gamble while my friends wait in line, and I made a little cashish, so that was really not horrible for us. However, when we finally get to the front of the line (over an hour later)--we all go to pay and they have us pay extra gratuity to get a table together? Like, okay, whatever, I would've tipped that amount anyway, but weird. And then we were told it would be ANOTHER HOUR. Go f*ck yourself. Why have someone out there saying how long the wait is going to be if that is all A MOTHER F-ING LIE? WHY? WHY? AREN'T YOU A NICE HOTEL? WHY AREN'T YOU NICE?

Needless to say, we flipped our collective shit. We ended up getting seated 20-30 minutes later. All in all, what we were told was 45 minutes ended up being closer to 2 hours. Unacceptable.

Only a few of us did bottomless beverages. Those were filled at an okay pace, which is why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1.

Not one single food item blew me away. I am a vegetarian, so I could not try everything, but I cannot remember (from 3 weeks ago) a single dish, I only remember disappointment.

Why'd it get knocked down to four stars? 2 reasons: #1 This isn't your everyday buffet - make sure you save up because it is mighty pricey! But use the frequent buffet-goers tip: come in toward the end of lunch time (=lunch prices) and stay until dinner is served (=more awesome dinner food). #2 The line was long! I was already starving when I got into line and more than a half an hour later, even hungrier!

Try a little bit of everything because I did and it was ALL awesome! Then go back for seconds of what you really liked. Then when you're already full, hit the deserts which put you over the top. Oh, the deserts - their presentation is absolutely amazing and makes you want to grab one of each cake, pie, mousse, cookie, sorbet, gelatin, and any other nifty little desert they had out. I wouldn't suggest grabbing one of each though, unless you want diabetes from one meal. 

It's been a few months since I went, so I can't quite remember everything, but a few things that stand out in my memory are:
- a curry station. i think that's what it was. we got to choose the vegetables, the meat, etc and they cook it for you. it turned out really really good!
- salads in a cup. they had small portioned prepared salads of different variety - all looked really good! the one i got was good good good!
- and their desert bar\/room\/area thing. oh yea, i already mentioned that one.

The ambiance is very clean and upscale. What did I say, you get what you pay for. The only thing that bothered me was the couple next to us.

Then I ask, ""why exactly is that ma'am?"" Turns out they start serving dinner for Holidays at 1 in the afternoon. You lazy lima beans! It's not even dark out and you are charging people $57.50 for dinner?? Please!!

So, we had to come back another day to get our free grub on. 

I just can't give this place 4 stars. It's really good, but I strive to provide 4 stars to establishments that are far beyond really good and with a few exceptions, the majority of the food here is under a warming lamp and that's a far cry from top of the Yelp food chain. 

I am not going to run down the list of items because I truly believe that 65% of the buffet experience is the element of surprise. I will say that their dessert options are some of the best you will enjoy at any buffet.",2,1,1

other than that it's all the same, prime rib, lamb, seafood, crab legs, etc.

one thing i will admit is the dessert bar is amazing...too bad i don't like sweets.

When we left around 10 am, a small line had formed.  I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait long if you get there before 10 am.

We loved the decor of the Wynn buffet (as well as the hotel).  The dining areas were broken down into smaller areas.  The tables were comfortably spaced.  It was very quiet.

Our server was very attentive and checked back with us at least 5-6 times.

The food presentation was beautiful.  My husband and I sampled many different breakfast items.  Everything was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the fresh vanilla pineapple with toasted coconut.  When I saw case after case of breakfast bakery items, I thought I had died and gone to heaven!  We've been to many buffets in Vegas.  In my opinion, the Wynn is tied with the Wicked Spoon for top spot.  For $20, you will get a fabulous gourmet breakfast buffet in upscale surroundings.

Conclusion:  I highly recommend the Wynn breakfast buffet!",0,0,0

My friends and I came here for lunch on Saturday, so we paid the weekend buffet price. The line was really long, so we each paid an extra $12 to get to the front of the line. This is worth it if you're hungry, and it includes a mimosa too. We were seated in no time, and we would've likely waited over an hour in the regular line. So far, so good.

The brunch options were not extensive. There was an omelet station, and your standard brunch fare: eggs, bacon, waffles, seasonal fruit, etc. There was hardly any seafood, aside from some smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail. The weren't even crab legs in sight. I would've liked more gourmet offerings, especially considering it was a weekend and I paid close to $50. There wasn't really anything memorable.

When he wins enough money he treats us here and we gorge ourselves until we can barely move. For the price they should provide scooters or gurneys to help overstuffed patrons get out. Just kidding, of course. :D

I'm not much of a food snob. I'm not too picky. I really like the food. I like the crab legs, and their mashed potatoes are really good. The pumpkin ravioli was strange, but still pretty good once you got used to it. The prime rib is perfection in how cooked it is (rare! so juicy), but I found it a little bit lacking in flavor on the inside (where it is most juicy and delicious). Even the kimchi and Asian stuff in the bamboo steamers are really good (beats some stuff I've had in  the ""good"" hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop places, believe it or not). The sushi is bleh... mostly California roll-type stuff, nothing special. I never get anything from the ready-made pasta counter because filling yourself up with carbs at a place like this doesn't seem worthwhile. Filling yourself up with crab legs, on the other hand... so worth it! They have a Thai curry station, too, which is really spiffy in my book. Finally, lobster pot pie? A delectable combination of two of my favorite foods: lobster, and pot pie. So awesome. Overall, the selection and quality of food is fantastic. Also, the desserts are really yummy.

The service is pretty good... drinks are refilled reasonably quickly, and plates are generally cleared away when you're gone (I never saw them clear the plates away but when I got back, they were gone). 

And yes, the lines are comparable to those at Disneyland... except that instead of some boring ride you get to stuff yourself until you're sick... and then some more after that. Mmm, gluttony. Viva Las Vegas!",1,1,0

Due to a combination of staying at the hotel, business dinners, and a comp, I ended up eating here for 3 times this week, all dinners, so this is the review for dinners.  Waits were consistently less than 30 minutes every night of the long MLK weekend:

Beverage options: 3.5\/5 - your standard sodas and juices.  Alcohol is extra and is just ok (and it takes away from your food space!)

Seafood station: 2.5\/5 - none of the seafood was fresh -- you can notice that from the slightly rubbery sat-in-the-ice-too-long texture and the overly salty flavor (not just because it's from the ocean; fresh ocean crab when cleaned and cooked quickly have a much mildly flavor) so what they had in quantity couldn't match for quality elsewhere.  The sauces and butter were good about masking it though and made it way more tolerable.  A bunch of tourists get suckered into this station because ""shellfish = expensive"", so they gorge on subpar eats here.

Sushi station: 3\/5 - was ok, but the ratio of rice to meat was too high for my tastes.  The poke again was tolerable - ok texture and taste but no freshness.

Peking duck station: 2.5\/5 - the buns with meat\/skin are unevenly distributed to have way too much bun, not enough skin and meat, and too much sauce.

Chinese food station: 2.5\/5 - just tolerable.  The pork buns were ok, but the whole point of dimsum is the delicateness of it and the shumai were substantial and had fine ingredients but cooked without delicacy and mushed into a big basket.  Chicken was basically Americanized Chinese fast food chicken, gets the job done but unrefined.

Korean pancake station: 4\/5 - tasty, but I wish the pancake was smaller so I could eat more things. :)

Meat station - 4.5\/5 - ribs are pretty good, korean beef is pretty good, prime rib is excellent.  All sauces are good.  Chashu and chicken are good but geez why eat the cheap stuff here. :)  Oh and those grilled peppers are HOT -- delicious!

Indian station - 2.5\/5 - was just ok.  Again, tastes passable but no art to it.

Mexican station - 3.5\/5 not bad, taco station is good, elote is yum, the other stuff was just ok.

American food station - 3.5\/5 - fried chicken is good but a bit too much (1\/2 size would be great), meatloaf is good, mac n cheese is good (would be great if they have substantial bread crumb crust), veggies are all delicious (carrots, asparagus, snap peas).  Polenta was not bad.

? station - 4\/5 quail was good but gimmicky, lamb chop with farrow is tasty and substantial.  There was some ""hangover slider"" sloppy-joe-with-cheese thing on a night as well, those were yum.

Italian food station - 3.5\/5 - chicken parm is good, seafood pasta is not bad, and meatball and pasta... well how do you even go wrong with that!  Everything is tasty but cheap and filling.

Euro seafood station: 3\/5 - mussels were tolerable at best, the seafood medley thing is ok -- both suffer from the shellfish-is-rubbery syndrom.  The fish dishes are meaty but just tolerable on the prep side of things -- disappointing, because the meat is clearly fine, just the cooking is ruining it.  OTOH, catfish\/tilapia has been consistently tasty, but is the cheapest meat of the bunch too. :(

Pizza station: 3.5\/5 - not bad, just wished the ingredients were more special\/deliberate as opposed to plain ol' veggie pizza, pepperoni, and meat n veggie combo.

Bread station: 3\/5 - fine, but why fill yourself with bread here?

Soups station -- 2\/5 - wildly varying.  The corn soup was good, but both the tomato bisque and the lobster bisque were abominable.  Uneven consistency and with this weird sat-around-for-too-long kinda stale taste.

Salad station - 4\/5 - watermelon was just ok, beet salad is good but hard to mess up, and the picked veggies were unmemorable.  The fresh salads though kinda saved the day -- esp the tricolor cabbage thing and the maple roasted apple salad were both particularly excellent.  They had a tolerable fruit mix that was exotified with fresh lychee, but people kept on raiding that and only picking the lychee fruit out ahaha.

Dessert station:  Their sweets end very strongly for them. 4.5\/5
Things that are good\/excellent: cheesecake with some fruit jam, strawberry shortcake, panna cotta with guava (fantastic!), lava cake, tapioca with fruit compote
Things that are serviceable: creme brulee, carrot cake, ice creams (good, just not remarkable), magic bar, no-sugar fruit pies, truffles (just save your money and buy a box from a boutique), fresh crepes (fantastic esp with ice cream... but IMHO not worth the stomach space)
Things that are meh: applejack cheesecake, thai creme shot thing (totally wtf), green tea cupcake, chocolate cone dessert thing, no-sugar chocolate cake (get the lava cake instead), cookies",0,0,0

First of all, I'm a big fan of buffets. I had Le Village @ Paris (breakfast, lunch, dinner), Bellagio (dinner), Mirage (dinner), Seafood buffet @ Rios (dinner), and Spice Market (lunch & Brunch). My favorite used to be Paris, but the quality of buffet was on a free fall and I swear off as of last year. 

Now let's talk about the Buffet @ The Wynn: 

Deco: The best from all the buffets I had. Very open space with natural or what feel like natural lighting. Lovely plants and great paintings all over the dinning area. 

Service: Depends on your servers. We found the previous diners gave $2 change for tips to our server. 15 mins and no drinks later, I understood why. However, the new server at dinner time was much better. 

Variety and Rating of food: Of course, it's no Spice Market, but still sufficient. I only gave ratings to the food I tried. 
The buffet is divided in areas-- 
Cold seafood: lunch: chilled soup, smoked salmon etch (N\/A) 
dinner: peeled shrimp and Alaskan King Crab 
legs (""B+"" for the huge shrimps--reminded me 
of the good old time @ Le Village)Japanese: Yes, the sushi selection is just sad (""C"") 
Fruit salad\/speciality salads: love the salads (""B+) 
Chinese: worst from all the other buffets on selection & taste (""C"") 
Mexican (lunch)\/Mediterrean(dinner): (""B"") 
Grills: (N\/A) 
Craving station (same Prime Rib for lunch\/dinner, leg of lamb for lunch and lamb chop for dinner): Prime Rib was good. leg of lamb was overdone, lamb chop was much much better (""B"") 
American: (N\/A) 
Italian: lunch (B-), dinner (C+) 
Pizza: (N\/A) looks great 
hot Seafood: (B-) 
Soups: 4 variety but too salty (""C"") 
Salad bar: moved from the first station for dinner. 
Deserts: not a true beauty! Everything looked great but nothing compares to Bellagio. The crepe was just bad--Paris had the best.

I've actually been to their dinner buffet before and I'd give their dinner buffet 4 stars!  So I was hoping brunch would live up to their dinner, but sadly, it didn't.  Brunch was $40 and I was really excited cuz I was starving, but when I got my food an started eating, I was disappointed.  Nothing really stood out as being really good.  Presentation is nice, but if the food's just ok, it makes me sad.  I got a lot of food (I eat a lot) - prime rib (which was ok and kinda tough and bloody, but I've definitely had better), ribs (which were dry), squid ceviche (meh), dungeoness crab quiche (didn't see or taste the crab), an omelet (just an omelet), eggs benedict (i've definitely had better, and the muffin was burnt), cute mini waffle with fruit (i think this was my favorite, which is kinda sad), congee (I was surprised they had preserved eggs, but the congee itself lacked flavor and needed a lot of salt), yogurt parfait (i sadly think mcdonald's is better and i'm boycotting that place!), grapefruit (sour), a macaroon (not good...so sad!), bread pudding (i've had so much better!!), this marshmellow thingy (meh) and a couple other desserts which weren't very memorable.  

As far as service goes, our waitress was...not sure how to put it...she asked if we wanted drinks and we all gave her our order but when she repeated it, she forgot a few of our drinks and we had to repeat it for her.  She didn't write anything down and when she came back with our drinks, she kinda got it wrong...

Overall, I left feeling full, but dissatisfied.  I've had my share of buffets in Vegas, and although I think this place has a pretty good dinner buffet (from the last time I was here, which was a few years ago...I'm hoping it's still the same), they need to up it a notch or two for their brunch.

Once dinner rolled around, it made the lunch price worth it, but I don't think I'd pay $30 for the dinner they had. They had shrimp, mussels, crab legs (though they weren't super fresh).
The ONE great dish they had was the sea bass, which was fucking delicious. I'd definitely go back for more of that haha.

I thought the dessert selection was alright. This is the only buffet I've seen that offers crepes made on the spot, and also gelato\/ice cream served to you.

This buffet is not too bad but the better one would be at the Caesars.  Caesars buffet has more choices and they are about the same price so overall you do get more value at Caesars.  In terms of the dining atmosphere, this might be a little better in terms of interior design and it has just a bit more fine dining experience to it.  We also tried Wicked Spoon but still prefer Caesars over it.

I'm a seafood lover and Caesars definitely offers more seafood options.  Caesars has both cold and warm crab legs where the ones at Wynn are only available cold and they are way too salty.  Also Caesars offers fresh oysters which Wynn does not offer.

We find the overall quality and the taste of choices better at Caesars.  The Chinese section at Caesars buffet offers way better choices and tastes over Wynn.  Overall, we find that Caesars tops Wynn in almost every section of the buffet.

The best part, in my opinion, is the dessert area. I could have gone to the buffet just for that! Fresh crepes, ice cream counter, cakes, pastries, cookies, etcetera, etcetera! It was amazing!

I've only been for the crossover from lunch to dinner. Dinner is a pricey penny but then again they have seafood for dinner. I love their noodle station, you make your own soup noodle with a chef that cooks it right in front of you. Yummm. 

They also have several meat carving stations, so delicious. 

And their best part is their dessert station. They have a chef making fresh crepes for you. You can get hand-scooped gelato or ice creams. And they have tons of mousse desserts along with creme brulee. Mhmmm yum.

Food that tasted like it came out of a box (because it probably did) and chicken that's been sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours (because it did)--not really my cup of tea. The Wynn buffet changed all of that.

My sister, her better half, my better half and I all went off to Vegas for a little mini vacation. As my strapping Swede has never been to Vegas and can eat his weight in meat, I was excited to take him to a buffet just to see how much he could eat. (This is the same man that ate a 33oz steak at Mastro's.)

EVERYTHING HERE IS DELICIOUS. And I mean it.

Do not eat the day you go. Do not have breakfast. Do not have a bagel. Do not have anything. Save yourself. It's worth it. It's an event. Make time for it. Take a half-time break to let your food settle so you can eat more.

The Wynn's buffet reputation is well deserved. The food is delicious, the variety is pretty amazing, and not once did I taste something that was served too cold or had sat out too long.

The desserts though. DAMN Y'ALL. The offerings are great, and everything is served in such small portions you don't feel like you are indulging. However, in reality, when you put 10 mini-desserts on your plate, you're in glutton territory. NO RAGRETS! They offer quite a few no sugar added\/sugar-free dessert options. I mean, you control how many calories you eat when you're at a buffet, but let's be honest: who the hell goes to a buffet to watch what they eat?! Answer: NO ONE.

If you are in Vegas, go. I am sure some of the newer buffets have more options, but I really liked the Wynn's. The service was pretty good, I liked the ambiance, and I didn't feel like it was too busy or crowded. My Swede put away several plates of food, and if he was on Yelp, I'm sure he'd say the same thing I do: GO GO GO GO GO.

I am moving to Sweden in less than a month and I really, really, really want to find the time to go to Vegas again before I land in lutefisk and lingonberry territory. If I do, I'm making a beeline for the Wynn.

One small thing that bothered me: the lemon cream dessert I tried had this terrible metallic taste to it. Kind of a rookie mistake for a buffet that has to be high quality. I had to deduct a star for it because it kind of put a damper on what would have otherwise been a 5-star experience. First world problem's y'all.

Price? EXCELLENT.  I came here on Friday before 3:30pm to get a weekday lunch price of $24.  The dinner food rolled in shortly afterwards.

Food?  HITS AND MISSES.  
- Duh, go for the prime rib.
- Vegetarian options are generous and pleasing!  They have curries and Indian naan.
-  The items in the bamboo steamers are delicious, but watch out because the steam will sting your hand!
- The crab legs could definitely be more fresh.  At Bellagio buffet, the seafood was sweet, a sign of freshness. Here, not so much.
- DO NOT get the made-to-order pasta unless you like to drink olive oil.  The chefs go insane with the oil, adding enough to create a thick layer beneath your pasta.  Disgusting and unappetizing.
- The dessert selections looked beautiful, but the items I tried did not live up to their visual appeal.  I preferred the GELATO (could not stop getting this.  they come in the cutest tea cups) and the denser cakes (chocolate based).  The jello\/champagne like shooters were icky tasting.

I can't really remember since it was three days ago and I'm suffering from early onset Alzheimer's.  In any case, I said ""Hell yes!""  Big mistake.  

On to the review:  my recommendation is to go early if you're serious about eating mass quantities.  We got there around 5:30 and the line was already starting to form.  Seating was near the front, away from the buffet.  Not a bad thing since I needed to burn a couple extra calories to pack some more prime rib in.   Waiter dropped by and took our drink order, then on to the food!

The Wynn is great in both variety and quality in my opinion.  The prime rib was a perfectly cooked medium rare, au jus not too salty and very beefy and the straight horseradish packed a punch.  The roast lamb with a little mint jelly was good, a little overcooked.  The line for the seafood at that time of day was not too bad.  Crab legs with a little clarified butter?  Don't mind if I do!  White anchovy salad? Please!  Smoked salmon?  Yes!   Skipped the pasta bar and the salads, although they both looked good.  Dessert was spectacular.  A dozen types of gelato, the coconut was great.  Honestly, the other sweets were a blur but more on that later.

The downside:  the cheese and charcuterie section only had three types of cheese and meat; all very good though.  The sushi section was woefully undermanned.  I saw that poor girl slicing away frantically trying to keep up with all the demand.  

My downfall was, of course, all you can drink alcohol.  Not that I got drunk and made a fool of myself.  I had the hubris to think that I could tackle BOTH the buffet and all you can drink in one sitting!  Total rookie mistake but I'm not a rookie!

They are cut open so you can just shovel the meat in. The only part is I prefer them warm but understand this would be hard to keep them warm here. Maybe I'll post a picture even though I see someone else has a better one with crab legs. I should have taken a picture of the pile of shells that were left over at the end.

The waiter did a great job getting us drinks quickly and I could tell many people were not tipping him enough for how hard he was working. We gave him a great tip.

I came here because of the other Yelp reviews that mentions Vegetarian\/Vegan options.

I mentioned that to my hostess as we were being seated- I told her I had never been here and I was a Vegetarian.  At that point she told me that she would send the Chef to my table to give me a tour of the buffet line so that I would know what was Vegetarian.

What a pleasant surprise when Chef Russell came to my table along with another Chef to tour me through the line.  Total first class treatment and completely unexpected.  I want to add that the dishes are pretty well marked as to what is Vegetarian but the personal tour was amazing. Chef Russell totally took his time with me, I never felt rushed or like he would rather be doing something else.  Thank you Chef Russell.

The information that was very important that Chef Russell told  me ws that they would custom make me Fried Rice  (as opposed to the Fried rice that contained animal products) as well as custom make Pasta.  DO NOT BE SHY about asking them to do that.  The chef I had both times was cheerful and made up my dish for me.  WOW.  So nice to have such great customer service.

This buffet is definitely worth the price.  As a Vegetarian I usually have minimal options and leave feeling they made a lot of money on me.  Not so with the Wynne.

We went to grab our food as soon as we settled. I walked around to look at the selection and it was limited. The serving space was vast, but they spread the items around so you only get 4-5 items per station.

I started with roasted quail, some cold cuts, roasted duck and lamb chops. I have not ate anything so awful at any restaurant or when I fail at my bbq. The quail was as hard as a baseball and essentially tasteless. The roasted duck was pretty much the same. The lamb chop was like a piece of rubber, it literally (not figuratively) took me 30sec to cut a bite size piece off. 

By the end of my first plate, the server still hadn't come by to take our drink order. I looked around and noticed that the server had way too many tables to take care and that was why there were so many open tables ready to be used.

On the second trip I took some flank steak, sushi roll, crispy pork belly and crab legs. The steak was again chewy, perhaps it was prepared with dogs in mind? The sushi roll was dry as the Nevada desert and was falling apart when you grab it with chopsticks. The pork belly was OK, but it was almost pure fat.

I'll admit it, the boyfriend and I are snobs and we usually steer clear of buffets. This past weekend we were staying at the Encore, it was a Sunday morning, two friends joined us for brunch and as we were walking around the resort we walked right into the buffet. We were just about to walk away from it when we got a bit curious and decided to check it out. 

The line was ridiculous! It was Sunday brunch so I think the price was $32 a person. We didn't want to wait in line, so we paid the extra $15 a person for the VIP pass. $15 includes, line cuts to the front, and a free drink, your choice of sangria, wine or a mimosa. Not a bad deal since the hosts in the front told us that the line was 45 mins to an hour long. No thanks!

The buffet was amazing! As we were being walked to our seats we were oooing and ahhing at all the desserts and the large amount of food selection. They were prompt with the alcoholic drinks and we went on our way through the food. The selections seemed endless so half of us just walked to the end just so we could see everything to mentally prep our stomachs. 

There was an omelets station, prime rib and fatty bacon cutting station, fresh sushi, fresh shrimp, tons of pasta selections, everything breakfast related, fresh fruit and baked goods, Mexican cuisine, Asian cuisine etc. Lets just say everything was there!

The highlights: Fatty bacon was delicious with their special mustard. The shrimp wasn't your typical baby cocktail shrimp, definitely huge fatty juicy shrimp with cocktail sauce, cups of marinated watermelon and pineapple (the pineapple was marinated in rum and coconut flakes)

Everything we ate was delicious, by the time we got to desserts we were stuffed. We tried a few cakes (all yummy) and their gellato! Yes you heard right, they had many flavors of gellato for you to choose from. I would definitely advise not to fill up on the bread (although delicious) definitely fills you up so you can't eat all the other amazing food there.

Aside from the food, the service was amazing as well. Empty plates and cups were always cleared promptly from our table.",5,3,1

I have no time for those people who just show up to the buffet haphazardly, fill their plate with mac and cheese, eat a bunch of bread, wash it all down with a diet soda and then complain that it wasn't worth 50$.

LISTEN....

1. Go for breakfast - Only 25$

2. Stay for lunch - Time it so you get some breakfast time and some lunch time. The last time I went I put down a plate of half a dozens eggs benny and then was able to enjoy a follow up plate of ahi tuna and sushi rolls -it was beautiful. 

3. Do a recon round first - Your first plate should be tiny portions of each and everything that catches your eye. Be sure to start at one end and go to the other. This is critical. This way you can taste a bit of everything and plan your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th assault accordingly

3. Do not get anything to drink - Only a clown wastes stomach space on liquids.

4. Be selective - Don't get overwhelmed and fill up on the first white flour based nonsense that catches your eye. The same masterminds that lay out the casinos so that you get lost 19 times on the way back from the ATM are employed to carefully lay out the buffet with your best interest not in mind. Work the edges, go slowly, and keep your head on a swivel.

5. Go for the good stuff - I feel like this goes with out being said, but the fact of the matter is, so many people go to these buffets and treat them like a continental at Super 8. PUT THE CEREAL AWAY, go for the goodies, it's a buffet in Vegas for goodness sake...let loose! Load up on bacon, go hard on the eggs, get your cheese fix, find the best creamy stuff, and ensure that the adjective ""alarming"" is the best way to describe your portion of salmon.

6. CREATE! - So many people think that because the chef put the bacon and eggs in different apparatuses that you are meant to eat them separately. Not the case! Buffets are the perfect place to flex your creative culinary muscle. So go wild! Top your eggs Benedict with pork belly then smother it in gravy, or better yet, take advantage of that smoked salmon for more then just boring cracker stacker -mix it in with eggs, or mix up various sauces\/seasonings\/flavors from around the buffet to create a unique dipping sauce. 

7. Time - Timing is critical, but also very tricky. If you gorge yourself right away you get an upset stomach and have to tap out early like a loser. However, if you eat to slow your stomach will start sending full signals based on actual nourishment, as opposed to physical capacity. The best advice is to eat slow and steady, keep a strong pace, but take frequent breathers.

8. CHEW - This is arguably the most overlooked method to proper gut stuffing. I could bore you with the science of it, but let me put it like this, sending food down into your stomach is like a game of Tetris... and chewing your food really good is like sending down straight line after straight line.",36,56,14

Then we joined the Encore's Red Club, played slots and blackjack, won $475 and got comped two free buffets. We pleaded with the player's club rep and he gave us two VIP front of the line tickets. I haven't felt this happy about skipping a line since I got a Magic Express pass at the Magic Kingdom!  

Is it worth the wait anyway? Absolutely yes! I greedily piled on the King Crab legs and peeled shrimp. Talk about being treated right: good-sized shrimp and they even split the crab legs so you don't have to wrestle with the poor creatures. One surprise--no drawn butter.

We sat both times in the nice courtyard by the entrance. More peaceful than in the main rooms, although there is the guilt factor of being able to see the hungry people waiting in line. Other advantage is that we had to walk past the desserts on the way back to the table, so we grabbed something each time we passed. Formula for success: Eat a course, eat desserts, repeat! And what yummy desserts, better than any other Vegas buffet. 

Was it perfect? No, but pretty close for a buffet. Staff was attentive and friendly. List of foods and desserts we liked would be too long to describe here. Highlights for us? Mushroom soup, grilled flank steak, bread pudding, creme brulee, tiramisu, and on and on.

What didn't I like? On the first visit for brunch, seemed like food could have been hotter. Char siu bao (steamed pork buns) had very little meat and very little flavor.  Tried the prime rib carving. Yuck! Way too much fat and no meat.

I came here on a Friday before 8PM expecting a 2 hour wait, but surprisingly the line was shorter than I thought, thus leading to a wait time of a little over 20 minutes. I have no idea if it's like that around that time on a Friday, but I'll take it. 

Yes, if you're not aware its freakin' 38.99 per head. Considering Wynn had a promo where if you earn 55 rewards points from gambling you're entitled to a free buffet at any time (new members only), my dad took full advantage of this, thus leaving me to pay for my meal because I already have a players card. Eff.

Not gonna lie, I'm still not sold on the variety of food they have, but I will say that the quality makes up for it, at least for the dinner portion. The Alaskan king crab legs were as epic as can be with a nice cup of warm butter to dip it in. I will stress this part (though it's been said a lot of people already) that you can expect to wait in a line for the crab legs due to the high demand for it. Asian folks are ruthless when it comes to this, and I'm no exception. Though this may sound selfish and makes me seem like a complete fatso, grab as many crab legs as you can, but also know your limits. I'm pretty sure I grabbed at least 15 crabs legs in one plate, while my dad grabbed a few more of his own. Keep in mind they come conveniently cracked in half down the entire leg. 

The highlight for me was the prime rib. Extra tender medium well\/medium\/well done cuts had more going back for seconds and thirds. The meat was seasoned very well, not too salty and not dry at all. Don't judge me, I paid over 40 bucks to enjoy my dinner and I made it worth my while. 

Lastly, I topped of my dessert with a delicious strawberry crepe and put caramola ice cream on top. The wait time to get a crepe varies, so if you're toward the end of your meal and you see the line is short, go for it. 

Solid 4.5 stars from me. They may not have as much variety, but their food overall is pretty delicious. You may even be one of the lucky folks to sit in the middle of the buffet amongst the Alice in Wonderland\/Mad Hatter scenery. Hopefully this review didn't make you gain a couple pounds just by reading it. Ha.",2,1,1

My friend was really into this place and since she has been to almost all of the Vegas buggets, she recommended this one and I was all for it!

I wasn't impressed with the selection of food.  

Thai Beef Salad - yuck.  Salt & Soy Sauce galore!
Lamb - pretty good!  It was my first time eating lamb, so I have nothing else to compare it to.
Lettuce Wraps - yum!  
Crab legs - could have been better
Curry - bland... but the bread was flaky like a croissant so I liked that part
Sushi - worst selection of sushi I've ever seen.  There's a bigger and better variety and more tasty sushi at a local buffet that costs only $15 a person.  Stay clear of sushi here if you like sushi elsewhere

The items I enjoyed the most were the fresh salads (lots of variety from fruit, veggie, to seafood), all the seafood dishes, but especially the tuna poke and squid salad. The meat dishes were not bad, but nothing really stood out either.  The desserts were plentiful and beautifully presented.  The way to go is to get a big plate with a bit of everything to sample.

So this is the second buffet I've been to in Vegas, the first being the Bellagio buffet.  Every time I walk into a buffet I can't help but wonder how the prime rib will compare to the rest.... ahhhhh.  As usual there's the regular & creamy horseradish and it tastes SOO good with the au jus too.  A whole plate devoted to prime rib and Alaskan King crab legs piled on top.  

I love those little cups of salad too, had a greek salad and it wasn't shy with regards to dressing and flavor.  The smoked salmon was better here than at Bellagio, it was delicious, smoky, and flappy.  

SALMON EGGS BENEDICT... the toasted muffin under it was so crispy and the poached egg melded so deliciously with all the flavors.  We were lucky to arrive before the brunch ended so my first plate consisted of brunch deliciousness.  

No macaroons here, but no need!  They have gelato \/ ice creams! Mini cupcakes with glitter sprinkles!  Legit candy apples -- not caramel apples, but candy, because the coating was definitely very hard and had a deep red translucent glimmer to it: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-buffet-las-vegas-6?select=qCMCBdm9Lf8BJBdRDKkNag#xlWILqTW6c-YmSfv_ZVE_g).

With groups of 6 or more, they charge an 18% gratuity, so I ended up paying $50. Definitely a horrible deal if you don't eat that much, but I was mostly bummed by how ordinary the food is. As far as seafood goes, both cooked fish options that day (maki and sea bass) that I tried were totally overcooked. I felt like I was back in my college's dining hall. The crab legs and shrimp were decent, but you can't really mess that up. Absolutely horrible sushi selection. There were no authentic or creative Asian dishes, either. Americanized pork buns and fried egg rolls? At least the broccoli was good! In the Italian section, I liked the homemade pasta and the risotto. Other pastas as described by my friends were unmemorable. The tortellini, which I did try, was too salty. In terms of meat, the best dish of the night was probably the lamb, which was perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed the prime rib but wasn't wowed by it.

Rarely are they consistent in the quality of food, and rarely do they warrant the hefty price tag that comes with them.  The Wynn Buffet exceeds all expectations I've ever had for a buffet.

For years the standard has always been the Bellagio Buffet.  The endless seafood selection, the hordes of crab legs and cocktail shrimp, fancy desserts, good meats,  etc.  All that for a hefty price of $40+.  however ever since the Wynn opened up, there is a new standard set on the strip for me.

The line is hellacious to get in, but it's so worth it.  With sixteen.....yes....SIXTEEN different cooking stations making fresh food for you left and right along with the 10+ cultural cuisines, there is something for everyone here.  Nothing here is what I'd consider ""filler"", but actually things you will want to try at least once.

You have your standard carving stations w\/ your standard prime rib and ham, however they throw in some lamb, some tri-tip, some tenderloin, and why not a turkey as well.  Come of the cooking stations include a fresh make your own Thai soup (i.e. Tom Yum!), pasta stations, Asian noodle, Mongolian BBQ, and so much more.  

The dessert station is just so cruel.  The layout forces you through the room w\/ the dessert station before you hit the main row of hot dishes.  It's like the buffet gods taunting you....""Yes....see what you can top your meal off with...if you have any room left.....MUWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!""  Well you know what I say to those gods?  Screw you, I'll eat dessert first!!!  HA!  Take that!  And yes, dessert would be a great starter too!  From the mini creme brulee's, fresh crepes, gellato, mini pies, and various cakes and cookies, your sweet tooths will curse you the moment you step out of the restaurant.

The service is really good here too all three times I've been.  Drinks are always full w\/o having to ask, plates removed in a timely fashion, and everything is clean and in order.

One of the misses already is that you dont have King crab, Bellagio does.
You guys have food that is mediocre at best. There was not a single thing that was great, just decent.

One plus is that the dessert hall was quite cool. Trees and such and candied apples is cool, but very hard and bad for your teeth.

The food choices may seem a bit exotic to visitors used to plainer fare at breakfast, but the omelet station is always reliable and the coffee is good. Meat selections are outstanding. Desserts are kind of a weak point - they tend to feature lighter, less sweet, pastry-like choices that may appeal more to dieters and Europeans than Americans who want their mega-blast of sugar. Service is excellent here, and you never have to wait long for drinks and refills. The dining areas are a lot nicer than in most other Strip buffets. 

Price is a negative - the food is good but probably not quite good enough to justify the premium they charge over other buffets. Certainly if you are staying at the Wynn it's better to eat here than to walk to Venetian or TI just to save a few bucks.",1,0,0

It's pretty pricey (about $48 I think) but worth it. What really makes this buffet is the crab legs. Yes, unlimited crab legs. So delicious, and the buffet practically pays for itself, considering crab legs at a restaurant at the Wynn will run you at least $55.. 
This isn't the largest buffet in Vegas but what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. The best dish I had was the deep fried turkey. Best turkey I've ever had. I also noticed that some of the offerings, like the pretzel bread, cupcakes, and gelato, are the same as those offered at other restaurants at the Wynn. This is a great way to sample what the Wynn restaurants offer at a fraction of the price.
There is a whole room full of hand-crafted desserts, including a crepes station with a variety of fillings.

The prime rib is very very good! I LOVE that they give you both spicy and creamy horseradish options!  

Must go to the pasta bar!  OMG!  The chef will make whatever your lil heart desires!  W\/ different pasta, ingredients, and sauces! You will definately be pleased! 

The crab legs are cut in halves so you to work like a slave to please your seafood fix or Asian fix to eat more of the expensive foods to feel like you got more for your $$$! (Like me!)  I LOVE that I can just pull the crab meat out w\/ my fork or fingers and butter them up and then eaten w\/in 2 seconds! My only complaint is that I LOVE hot seafood over cold and unfortunately, they only serve cold crab legs.  But, I'm Asian so I gotta devour the expensive food, whether I love it or not! LOL!

The soups and salads were amazing!

Oh OH OHHH! The dessert bar! OMG! YES, I'm a FATTY!  The gelato bar makes me so happy.  They don't offer many flavors.  Just about 4-5 different ones...but still so yummy!  Don't forget to go around the dessert bar b\/c on the other side there is a crepe bar!

The decorations are breathtaking! It was like an explosion of whimsical frenzy. Which is fantastic ! There is a wide variety of food for everyone to enjoy. Including raw seafood bar, sushi, gourmet tacos, pasta, pizza, steaks, Chinese, charcuterie, dessert with a wheel of ice cream and many more. They have any type of meat you can think of ! I was impressed with the wide variety of food selection ! I was satisfied with the types of food I was getting for the price I paid. Although there were many different types of food, a lot of the flavors were just not there. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't anything that particularly stand out for me. The oysters had very little meat which most oysters are plump but these were very small. The crabs legs were salty and they cut it in half so you didn't really get as much unless you get a lot. The desserts, some were a hit or miss. My favorite was the berry cheesecake, the rest were fairly alright nothing memorable.

Anyways, here are some of the things I remember having:
-Crab legs, what's new.
-Shrimp tempura sushi and california rolls-- that's it! wtf? For 40 bucks a person, they should at least have some nigiri.They also had smoked salmon, which I'm not fan of. The rolls were typical buffet rolls, stale and weird.
-Naan and curry- these were good.
-Sea bass
-That's all I can rmbr. It was not that significant.
-No oysters for all you oyster lovers.

For dessert, they had the typical.. gelato.. creme brulee.. cookies, etc. They didn't even have french macaroons! :(

That's how I feel at buffets. I'm not a big fan of buffets in general as I don't usually get my money's worth (done in 2 rounds). But we were comped this buffet for breakfast so I couldn't say no! 

The line was quite long when we arrived but it moved fast. With the exception of the grumpy old man in a scooter who complained that ""the staff don't care for the handicapped"" and we then saw walking around quite well, the people in line and the staff were quite nice.

I can't describe everything as there is just TOO MUCH but you really could eat healthy or unhealthy depending on what you were in the mood for. There was also a $19 unlimited alcohol package that we declined, but teas, coffees, waters and juices were complimentary.

So the food, I didn't love the matcha chia pudding (and I'm on a massive chia pudding kick right now), the biscuits were too salty, the waffles were a little chewy and dry depending on where you bit into.  The egg whites were good, but the oatmeal was gummy.  I wasn't expecting perfection as it is a buffet with high guest turnover but there are a ton of options so you should be able to find something to your liking after much trial and error.

The wait was LONG, clocking in at about 3 hours.  It went by fairly fast, and waitresses brought water bottles around for everyone.  One thing I wish someone would have remedied was the screaming kid who wouldn't stop crying for the ENTIRE hour wait in the inside line.  Cramped quarters, low ceiling, shrieking child.  Not necessary, one of the parents should have taken him out of there (and one of Wynn's staff should have told them so).  
Once we were seated, we asked our waitress if she could point out for us which dishes were vegan.  To our surprise and delight, she went and got a chef to personally take us to every single station and show us which options were vegan.  He was so friendly and went into detail about several dishes.  My favorite part was how the crowds parted ways for us.  It was definitely star treatment.  :-)
The food was absolutely incredible.  The highlight for me was the pasta bar, where you can pick your ingredients and sauce.  The alfredo (vegan!!) was ridiculously rich and perfect.  I'd live on that stuff. 
There were so many veggie dishes that I filled up way before getting to try them all.

Feel like these type of buffets are honestly worth it, even though every dish may not be amazing. You get to try so many creative dishes for $30-40 which would be almost as much as one dish at any other fine dining restaurant, and even less nicer places, since every place on the strip is pretty much overpriced.

Compared to the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo, the Buffet had fewer options and service was lacking, but the quality of the food and dishes were better and more thoughtful. Also, it's great that they are friendly to those with specific food preferences.

Our waters were rarely refilled, as we never saw our waiter, but our empty plates were almost always taken away, when we returned for more consumption. The table next to us even had to ask a hostess to get more water and be attended to.

I would like to check out their dinner, as I don't care too much for pastries, waffles, and pancakes, but it was nice to see many other offerings, that are more lunch based. Sushi rolls were fine, and were made with less rice than those at Wicked spoon. The shrimp egg roll was surprisingly good, filled with an abundance of shrimp meat. I enjoyed their seaweed salad, kimchi, and lox and bagels (with all the fixings). Their cocktail shrimp was also better than those at the Cosmo. What I was most impressed with was that they had congee! This is a staple traditional Chinese breakfast item. Not only did they have congee, but it was offered with the authentic condiments: 1000 year old egg, what they call a ""Chinese doughnut"", etc. and it was all actually quite good. 

Their mango tangerine sorbet was very refreshing and tasty. The passion fruit tapioca was very good. However, the candy apple while beautiful was inedible. The candy shell was impenetrable for me.",4,3,2

They serve turkey since today's Thanksgiving, I wait for a while and the turkey worths it. Crab legs are fresh and they taste great when you add ketchup. I didn't eat much because there's not much impressive food.

This chubby traveler however will consistently tell you the Wynn Buffet is the best. I last visited Vegas this past week and every time I go I have to go to the Wynn Buffet regardless of where I stay. Usually the Wynn Buffet always draws comparisons to the Bellagio Buffet since both offer more high end fare. I enjoy the Wynn Buffet much better than Bellagio though. Here is what a traveler needs to know about the Wynn Buffet:

First thing is first, price. The Wynn buffet will run you around $18 for breakfast, $24 for lunch, and $35-$38 for dinner. Prices may differ near holidays and on the weekends so be careful. Considering all the food prices in Las Vegas are inflated I think this is a very good deal. A sit down meal at another restaurant for a couple in Vegas is still going to run you around $50-$80 for even a casual place. I would probably go for lunch to get the most bang for your buck. The price does not include the price of alcohol so if you want this you may have to fork some more cash over.

The dining room never feels cluttered. Weekends and holidays the place is usually packed, but I have never been Mon-Thur and had to wait in line. Even on Memorial Day when I went, the line was long but moved pretty fast. There are also a good amount of large tables around to accommodate larger groups. The one good thing the Wynn buffet has going for it as compared to other buffets on the Strip is organization. Each station is spread out and lines are never an issue. The Bellagio Buffet always has places where logjams occur. Stations are divided by the type of food (i.e. seafood, Italian, salad, Chinese, seasonal). Food has always been hot, and each station extremely clean. Ask the servers behind each station if you have questions about the food since they seem quite knowledgeable.

Now the most important thing: the food. Everything here is consistently delicious. I am actually saddened by the reality that I can only put so much food in my stomach during each trip. Tip #1 before you start eating is to make sure and save room for dessert. The highlights for me here are always the seafood section. I am very picky about my seafood having lived near the Eastern coast most of my life. Their salmon and Chilean sea bass are always good. The pork buns and pot-stickers at the Chinese section are also very good. This recent trip some of the best food I had were the Kobe beef sliders, sweet potato orecchiette, smoked salmon, and hash browns (they have some breakfast items in there for lunch too). Try not to eat too much of one item because you simply need to sample a little of everything. Lastly, the desserts are also the best of all the buffets on the Strip. They have homemade ice cream here and a very nice selection of other treats. The pumpkin cinnamon cake is a must if they have it.  Make sure to ask for coffee before desserts as it is also very good.

I won't dole out many five stars but Wynn definitely deserves this. The only negative here is service sometimes. I think they need to hire more waiters\/waitresses. Usually if you are running low on drink you have to grab one of them when they pass by.  They have never been rude or inattentive however. 

So if you are still on that quest for the best buffet in Las Vegas, you can stop now and head over to the Wynn for an awesome gastronomic experience.",5,0,0

If you're wondering what there is, I ate:
-gnocchi
-vegetables with yogurt sauce
-Indian-style chickpeas
-Pasta
-Corn
-Indian-style rice
-Congee with Chinese donut, scallions and thousand-year old egg
-Smoked salmon
-Tomato gazpacho
-Smoked trout\/regular trout
-Crab legs
-Shrimp cocktail
-3 different types of cervice (ahi tuna, scallop, Mediterranean) out of the 6 or so there were
-Red snapper
-Cheese and grapes

This was my first time visiting the Wynn in Las Vegas, and wow, it quickly became my new favorite Hotel in town. Of corse I needed to try its famous ""The Buffet"".

The Buffet is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything about it was just great. 
Most importantly of corse - the food! Oh, just thinking about it makes me drool..
They offer a wide variety of quality food that definitely has something for everybody. From a picky eater to a fine dining expert, you will find something that is right for you.

Besides the regular buffet items like egg dishes, bacon, or pancakes, they offer quite a variety on healthier foods, even sugar free delicious desserts, as well as fresh pressed juices.

The second most important part for me (especially in Las Vegas) is the atmosphere and design. And this Buffet just topped some of my previous favorites. I had a Alice in Wonderland feeling throughout!

The buffet prices are not cheap, but absolutely worth it!

The key is to get here early for dinner or late for lunch to avoid the crazy lines.

After years of anticipating to try the Wynn Buffet, I can finally say that i've tried this infamous buffet.

On a monday night for dinner, prices were $38.99 (which was the cheapest amongst the wicked spoon, bacchanal, etc).

The selections were pretty standard and to be honest, a little underwhelming. They have all the basic selections of specialty salads, a pasta station, few sushi options, carving station, and of course a dessert selection.

In my opinion, the selection here was definitely more limited than wicked spoon and\/or some of the other buffets that I've been to. Their prize and glory would of course be the king crab legs, which were plentiful and sweet. I liked that they were already cut in half, making the picking a lot easier. Some commented that they had to deal with frozen crab legs, but ours were fine. 

I would say the highlight of the meal were these gigantic spanish spiced ribs that were to die for. Unfortunately, the prime rib was a disappointment. The crust was WAY too salty and almost inedible. I'm not a big pasta girl, so all those items were wasted on me. They did have a cute little peking duck bun station that was nice, although the server was never around. In regards to the desserts, they have the standard gelatos, crepe station, and many chocolate delicacies. 

All in all, for the price, I would say that The Buffet is a solid 3 stars option. Considering that we came at an off hour, i can't really complain about the wait. However, if I waited longer, I probably would've been more disappointed.

Would I come back? Probably not, like I said, everything was just okay, but nothing was memorable.",7,0,1

Knowing this-how does the famous Wynn buffet hold up?

Meh-it's okay.

Here's the problem-each dish is prepared to posh goodness.  However since each dish is so complex with foodie ingredients-many dishes normally available within my dietary restrictions were not.  Bacon or proscuitto would appear in random tartlettes or side dishes.  Basically? I felt like I spent a LOT of money to come to a buffet that did not have very many accessible dishes for vegetarians or semi-vegetarians.

My carnivore cohorts seemed pleased enough-but we all wish that we had just gone back to the Rio's buffet, which we all felt had a more robust assortment of dishes to select from.

The ceviche was nice but the seafood ratio was a little low for me... just came back from Belize.  I'm usually a big fan of king crab legs but, like the other buffets that offer them, these legs were skinny.  I guess I've been spoiled.  To me, though, this is one of the best food values on the strip when you take in account the number of good quality dishes that actually taste good as opposed to only sounding or looking good.",0,0,0

I come mainly for the endless treasure of king crab legs, already cracked at preped waiting for middle class people like me to pay the $35 entrance fee to consume this wonder.  Nothing makes a dinner more meaningful than having multiple plates of crab legs and a ongoing flow of butter lemon sauce to dip them in!  Who cares about heart problems, choesterol, etc  when you can eat this good.  Sure I take a sample of other products like the prime rib, fish and what ever else they offer there, but its not my first choice.  Then once you have consumed all the crab legs your body could handle, they have one entire room dedicated to desert.  Filled with cookies, crepes, gilato ice cream ( I hope I spelled that right) where you can put any amount of toppings they offer on them and eat it all up.  My favorite is the oreo crumbles!  Yum!

My first impression of the buffet is that it is probably the prettiest buffer on the Strip.  It's bright, colorful, whimsical, and has very pretty flowers.  There was no line when I arrived (5PM on a Friday), so that was an added plus.  It cost about $45 per person and you can add an all-you-can-drink deal for about $20 more.  The price wasn't bad - less than Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal.  

On to the food - everything was pretty good,  but nothing was particularly memorable.  I have a huge appetite and tried most of the items.  First of all, the organization of the buffet is kind of strange.  Starting from the far left, there is the seafood, sushi, assorted Chinese food, ramen station, carving station, American classics, tacos, pizza, Italian, seafood, bread, charcuterie, soup and salad, and dessert.  I guess it would make more sense, if I started on the right side, but still, the order was kind of weird to me.  

Anyway, for the seafood - the crab legs were on point (especially with the butter DUH).  I think this was the best item of the buffet.  The shrimp cocktail was decent, but nothing out of this world.  Sushi was not good - pass.  The Chinese food was decent, especially the dim sum and duck buns - of course there is better Chinese food in Chinatown, but this was pretty good to satisfy a craving.   The ramen was surprisingly very good.  There are a few broths you can choose from and you can choose whichever toppings you like.  Quite tasty and the ramen man was very friendly.  The best part of the carving station was the lamb chops.  They were tasty and perfectly cooked.  I was very disappointed by the prime rib, as it was way overdone despite me asking for medium rare.  The thick cut bacon was also very salty - very disappointing.  From the assorted American classics, I enjoyed the truffled mac and cheese, but the other dishes were not memorable.  I didn't eat the tacos, pizza, or Italian food.  I had some red snapper from the seafood station, which was pretty good.  The charcuterie selection was very good and definitely one of my favorite parts of the buffet.  Dessert was delicious as well - probably the best dessert bar at a Vegas buffet (which says a lot) - I enjoyed the rotating ice cream wheel and also the carrot cake.

$45 for dinner is pretty typical for a Vegas meal. Despite the buffet being gorgeous and all of the food being pretty good, Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal still take the cake for me.  I think prime rib is one of the essential things at a Vegas buffet, yet it was very poorly done here.  Also, the service here was not good.  The waitress hardly cleaned our table yet was very attentive to surrounding tables.

Will I be back?  Maybe if I am in Vegas for a prolonged amount of time.  If I only had one buffet meal, I definitely would be at Bacchanal instead.",3,1,1

Rustic lapin with noodles at the Italian section. The pumpkin ravioli was also nice. No chicken: substitute Cornish game hens for 'class' factor I suppose?

Despite being rare, thought the prime rib surprisingly flavourless. Excellent marinated flank stakes though - and this buffet is heavy on lamb. All of the lamb was cooked to perfection, which is impressive as I think lamb is pretty unforgiving on a buffet line. Lamb T-Bone in white bean reduction was a highlight - so good I had a second! 

Didn't think much of the crab, and the Bellagio's sushi bar has it ALL over this paltry choice. But the shrimp cocktails were great.

Dessert: again, think the Bellagio edges it out here, but ample choices. Caramel banana pie with dark chocolate - terrifically subtle. Excellent bread pudding, which while a Vegas buffet staple, you can seperate the boys from the men by the bread puddings. Did not try gelato.

Sit in the garden area. It is so pretty and nice. It is kind of like Alice in Wonderland's tea party decor-wise.

The food is quite good for buffet fare. The salads that they mix for you have a touch too much dressing on them, but are great. Other good food items - Chinese shrimp dumplings, risotto, bruschetta, shrimps.  

The desserts - this is where to spend your calories in this buffet if you have a sweet tooth like mine... The ice cream is excellent. Eat all of the flavors. Put toppings too! Candy apple is quite decent - it looks nice and eating it in the garden area makes it taste better. Lemon meringue thing in a cup = very very good. Strawberry shortcake recon in a cup was also very good. Black forest cake classed up in a neat slice - quite good. Apple crumble is sooo good and warm. Cream puff was so so - I have had better, but eat it anyway, it is not that big. The creme br√ªl√©e was not bad either, although the ones in Montreal are way better. Just eat it, since it tastes light and sugary. Crepe is good and ask for ice cream on it.

I was blissfully happy after I paid my dues and was able to walk from counter to counter filling my plate. If I could eat like this every day...

Las Vegas has a few things to offer, gambling, food, and unusual sights. Being the piggy I am, a large reason I went was for the food. And so this will be one of 3 buffets I went to, one for each day I was in Vegas. The worst of this all?? Choosing which buffets to go to!

Surprisingly I didn't have to wait that long in line on a Saturday night, about 30 minutes. I also got seated in the first room, instead of the other rooms which don't look so great. I guess it depends on what you like. The first room isn't decorated so nicely either. Big gigantic flower bouquet things surround you, but at least you have space.

First thing about the Wynn buffet that is great??? The food is almost always fresh! They only lay out so much of one dish so its constantly being refreshed! And the food is so spread out that you get some exercise from walking round and barely any wait to get food. The only lines are around the sushi, and the prime rib areas. Everywhere else you either just swoop in and get all you want, or just wait for one person only. So no fighting over the food!

So the best of the best? Ohhhh...the mussels in saffron cream sauce, udon noodles and the kalbi style flank steak! There was a decent variety of food, at good quality, and there wasn't anything I did not like.  It was either deemed good by me, or excellent. Prime rib, black bean chinese style clams, crab legs, duck salad, lamb, etc etc etc.

Not to mention all the desserts they had. A small selection of gelato that you can pair with topping and pizzelles. And cakes and tarts and cookies. Usually buffet desserts are pretty lame, but I chose a few of these and found them to be surprisingly tasty. Gelato looked and tasted homemade and not just from a container. Pizzelles were crispy and light and airy. I tried the oreo cake, orange ganache, and the pumpkin spice cake. I stuffed it all in cause it was sooo good. Yes piggy piggy.

Let me first say that i had never before had a bad experience at a Wynn resort.  This is what happened to me.  It was my sister's birthday and I suggested we go to the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.  What a special treat!  For the purpose of this review I will focus on the buffet - we walk up and there is no line for dinner.  We were a party of 9 and the cashier lets us know that if we sit together there was going to be an 18% automatic gratuity charge for a party of 8- that would be a charge of about $60-at $39.95 a pop .  (keep in mind that all the waitress was going to do for us was take our drink order??)  Great advice by the cashier - we should just get 2 tables.  My 5 y\/o niece is on a special diet and had just eaten so we explained that she would not be dining.  They sat us down at two adjacent tables but only gave us 8 chairs.  We didn't think anything of it, we just grabbed an extra chair for my niece and started to eat.  The waitress, instead of asking for clarification assumes we did not pay for my niece as part of our secret plan to cheat the buffet of $20-the charge for a 5 y\/o.  The waitress, probably feeling burned that we got two tables, flags down the hostess and the hostess comes over and yanks the chair away telling us we only paid for 8 people!!! Holy smokes, i am fuming - I guess the problem was that my niece at this point decide to eat a piece of fruit.  Fine - i was planning to pay for her buffet but the hostess went way overboard and acted crazy.  She made a whole big scene and tried to embarrass us.  Wow!  My sister gets really upset and up and leaves dinner along with her husband.  I went to the cashier and paid for my niece and finished my dinner.  My sister calls the manager on duty to explain how upset she is and what does this guy tell her (his name is Nick-hotel manager at night-and now I know why)?  ""Well I'm sorry you left dinner but it looks like your party is having a great time without you"" - apparently he was checking out the cameras?  He tells her that the Buffet manager brought over a champagne glass and desserts from the counter to apologize for the way they acted.  Yes - that is exactly what my sister needed to hear.  Alright - end of dinner - we walk out but my mom stays behind - my mom hears the hostesses laughing at us and cracking jokes about how they caught us trying to rip off the buffet and how they embarrassed us.  She calls them on it and and they all shut up.  The food is pretty good but some of this staff needs to be replace asap ( i think her name was Lila-elderly lady with a really terrible attitude).  I would also like to say that there is no need for the hotel to contact me because I have no interest in EVER stepping foot in this establishment EVER again.  Management at the Hotel was also condescending and of no help whatsoever.  Kyle, ""thanked"" me for letting him know about the problems and he said that he would be ""honest"" with me and tell me that there was no way he could refund us the buffet charges even though they ruined my sister's birthday celebration.  they took off 2 buffet charges for my sister and her husband-who left the restaurant before eating- thanks so much Kyle - you are a shinning star.  Every single word I have stated here is true or so help me!

Their selection of juices were pretty good.  They also had a good selection of comfort foods like chicken noodle soup and pastas such as rigatoni and spaghetti.  Their seafood though, is what made it.  It's all about that snow crab leg!!!! :9

Oh, and their desserts aren't too shabby either :D",2,0,0

My friend and I arrive at around 7pm to a decent sized line with about a 30 minute wait. Something tells me had we shown up 30 minutes to an hour earlier we could've walked in no problem because within 10 minutes the line had grown significantly behind us.

Price was about $80 for the two of us, including free (non-alcoholic) drink refills and coffee. The waiters were very attentive about it, usually making it over just after I emptied my glass.

As for the atmosphere, it's absolutely gorgeous. When you first walk in, the place is literally decked out in flowers, with a very springtime feel. Many restaurants I go to tend to keep the lights dim, but it was very well lit here, making the colors of the flowers stand out even more. Don't worry about being dressy. However a sign stated that all shirts had to have sleeves (for men at least).

As for the workers, some were more outgoing than others, but for the most part I was greeted by anyone who I walked past. The guys serving food (especially dessert) were all friendly and chatty, even offering suggestions.

Now for the food: It wasn't all that bad, but considering I hinge my buffet experience on the food, I was pretty disappointed. There were a couple of standouts, mostly in the seafood section. Crab legs (WERE ALREADY OPENED AND PERFECTLY CUT), clams were delicious, and sushi was fantastic but very small selection. The BBQ ribs were so tender that they literally melted in my mouth, so amazing, only wish there was more sauce on them. The veal was to die for! If you eat nothing else there, have the veal. 

The rest of selection however didn't thrill me. There was hummus but the pita bread was (ehh). There were small Asian & Mexican sections (egg roll, tamales [kinda dry in my opinion], burritos, etc). There was also a very tender, yet poorly seasoned beef brisket. Really, you NEED to have a sauce with it. Moving down there was decent meatloaf, disappointing lasagna as well as some other Italian food, pastas, etc. Nothing or that stood out. Finally there were oysters (ok) and some really dry salmon (such a disappointment). Besides that, there was tons of bread but most of it seemed as if it had been out all day, and then a huge selection of cold cuts if you wanted to make a sandwich and tons of toppings, which brings me to my next point:

WHERE WAS THE CHEESE? I don't know if it's just me, but I like to have something cheesy every once in a while. Especially if I go to the buffet, but there was a distinct lack of cheese in everything there, even the Italian food. I was really, really turned off by this.

As for the desserts, there were tons of choices served tapas style. Small portions of cakes, etc. so that you could try out a lot of different flavors. Unfortunately, most of them weren't all that good. The cakes were dry and lacked sweetness. Even the rice krispies were hardened as if they'd been left to sit for hours. The things you definitely want to try in the dessert section are the sorbet, which was scrumptious, and the warm brownie with almonds. Throw some ice cream on top and the mixture of warm brownie and cold ice cream just makes my heart smile.

Very interesting note: They had these fruit cups with alcohol in them. Pretty awesome. One of them was watermelon with tequila in it. The other was pineapples with malibu rum and coconut shavings. I hate coconut, but I loved this.

What's crazy is that it sounds like I ate a lot. I'm 5'10 165lbs, so I'm not a big person. My friend is about my size, just a bit taller. We actually finished trying just about everything and still had quite a bit of room left. I polished off a few more of those crab legs because I was still in amazement i could just pick large chunks of meat out with a fork. He tackled some more sorbet and we called it a night. We left there fairly satisfied with our fullness, but partially disappointed at the meal.

Tipped the waiters pretty handsomely though because they were awesome the whole night.",4,0,1

They have a seafood section, meat section, cheese section, and even a pasta station where they cook the pasta in front of you. King crab legs are a must, prime rib, rack of lamb, and risotto were very tasty. Had a lot of different desserts as well as a crepe station which was very good.

Cons: A little on the pricey side but its Vegas so what do you expect. Paid a little under 50 for dinner but was well worth it. Lines can be extremely long if you come during their peak hours. I also think some of the food was pretty bland and that they only focused on certain dishes which were amazing.

They have a great variety of food selections but I almost always go for the king crab legs and prime rib first. Most buffets will just give you any slice of meat but here, they'll cook the slab well done on one side and rare on the other giving you an option for some bloody-delicious meat. Lots of great tasting food but what really gets me coming here is their dessert selections. Specifically their infamous creme brulee...soooo sooo yummy!

Had the brunch without the champagne\/bloody mary option.   Very pricey (I think about $75 for two people), but when I went in, I realized why: prime rib!  Not a huge fan, but never seen prime rib at breakfast time in Sin City.  The good foodf:

*Gespacho--fresh and tart--kinda like the bloody mary I would have had if I could consume alcohol (I'm 6 months preggars).  Added cherry tomatoes, chopped cucumbers and chives. Yum!
*Chinese porridge--I stuck with the ""healthier"" ingredients, which included green onions, deep fried chives, cilantro, and thousand-year-old eggs (didn't add on the dried pork, cut up cruellers).  
*carving station bacon--cut off the fat and added the pieces to my Chinese porridge.  Tasted like high-end ham, but not syrupy sweet.
*fruit--loved the papaya and pineapple--juicy sweet!
*shrimp cocktail--succulent--similar fare to other gourmet buffets.
*ice cream--preferred the lemon yogurt (light and fresh), but the coconut and coffee (more like espresso) ice creams are good choices for the richer taste bud
*friends I went with who are BIG fans of cupcakes thought their mini-chocolate cupcakes with chocolate mousse frosting was the best they've ever had.
*didn't have this, but their candied apples added a whimiscal touch to their gorgeous array of desserts.

Comparisons to other fabulous vegas buffets (Bellagio, Paris)?
*Comparable in terms of quality.
*Not as many salad choices as Bellagio, but I only went for brunch, so not sure how dinner would compare.
*beautiful decor--much more light and bright compared to Bellagio and even more cheerful than the faux outdoors at Paris.

The price for dinner was $39.95 (which is like $4 more then last time I visited) and they no longer had king crab. For essentially a $50 dinner, I expect king crab, but they had snow crab which tasted old and not very good. The shrimp cocktail looked disgusting.

My boyfriend on the other hand has wasted his $40 with only plates of fried chicken, some string beans, and some more chicken breast. When you paid $40 for a buffet, you go for the most expensive stuff!! And then fill the cracks and any leftover space in your stomach with what ever else you want to eat.

First off, the staff here is really nice, we sat a small 2 seater table and our dishes never stacked up because they come by pretty frequent to clean out the unwanted dishes. Our waitress also constantly walks over just to check if we needed refills on our drinks.

Onto the food, on my first round, I went for the prime rib, the sea bass, the veal, some pasta, rataloulli. Everything wasn't too bad, typical standard to a buffet. I really liked their prime rib, it was cooked perfectly medium rare each bite wasn't too chewy nor soft like you're eating mush. That only concluded the first half of my adventure to the buffet tables. I continued to the other side where the ""seafood"" section was and I did not touch the sushi at all. Their sushi section was a giant disappointment, it looked worse than places like all-you-can-eat chinese buffets for $10.99. I ignored that section and went straight to the crab legs. What I liked about it was that they saw the crab legs in half already so you can easily just fork out the meat without all the hassle of cracking them open. It was decent, but I quit after 1 plates because it wasn't something I can keep on eating.

The cocktail sauce they had for their shrimp was a little heavy on the horse radish, not sure if it was just that night or if that's how they liked it. So instead, I ate their shrimp and crab as is. They had a cute little dessert room where trays of miniature desserts are placed out. I tried a piece of everything, but of course it was too sweet to finish all of them. I don't even know how to eat the candied apple, how the heck to you bite into that thing?!

The place is designed to be like a tea garden with suspended floral arrangements in the center space and some whimsical decors throughout.

This was a bit of a surprise to me. We ate on a Saturday night, and there was not enough staff to support the crowd, so I did come back to an empty plate more than once, and getting drink refills was impossible, even after asking. It gets knocked down a star just for that.

The braised duck salad was one of the highlights for me, and certainly my favorite salad selection. The ""cups"" of salads offered near the shellfish counter (I guess people go for the crab legs right off the bat, and can't be bothered to walk to the other end) were ok, but were too tough to eat out of the cup.

The four seviches offered was a nice touch, although the rock shrimp one was nothing special. The squid was nicely done, with strips of squid, cucumber, onion, and tomato all fitting the same form. I opted out of the four soups offered as somewhat standard fare (chicken noodle, clam chowder, red pepper bisque, and a fourth I can't remember), but the ""white gazpacho"", made from white grapes, parmesan, and some other stuff I could not identify, was one of the best things I ate all night.

The pumpkin gnocchi were of a very nice texture, to my pleasant surprise, and the sauce, while I felt it could use far more sage, was nice. The lamb osso bucco did not seem like it had been braised for long enough, and while the flavor was quite good, the meat was tough and very difficult to remove from the bone.

The item I was most excited about on my first walk through to look at everything was the rack of wild boar. Not so good. I got one chop from the end, which was pretty tough, and one from the middle, which was nicely cooked. The only flavors I picked up were wild boar, salt, and pepper; it would have benefited from a dry rub, marinade, or crust of some sort. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and seemed better seasoned than the boar, but I would have rather enjoyed better wild game. 

The tandoori chicken was well done, and there was nothing special about the fried chicken, but as I was trying to select sections of dark meat from the trays of each, I could not tell for the life of me what cuts I was pulling. They obviously do not butcher their chickens traditionally, and it looked like someone may have just stood at the chopping block waving a couple of cleavers and a bunch of chickens. This made eating around the bones a new and interesting affair, neither good nor bad.

The fish selections did not stand up to the quality of the rest of the buffet. I know it's hard to make fish en masse, but they could have done better. The tuna was actually not cooked totally through (a good thing), but the other three were just hammered.

For $40 a person, I would recommend finding somewhere else to sit down, unless you have your heart set on a buffet. Even for a few bucks more within the Wynn, you could do a lot better.",2,0,0

Yes, my heaven is a ginormous room with endless food and talented chefs. I'm not waiting around for my judgment day to enjoy this enormous spread, $50 on earth to eat this much seems like a fair deal to me.

Walking through the bright dining area lit with skylights, I felt like all that was missing was a harpist and a choir harmonizing. The flowers draped over the columns were really beautiful. I was so excited for natural light because this meant AWESOME PICTURES.

Entering through the corridor of desserts was such a tease. I stumbled through, not looking straight to where I was walking because I was so transfixed by the cute desserts in the displays. Naturally, being the stereotypical tourist, my first inclination was to raise the camera and snap a picture. It wasn't long before my boyfriend caught wind of this and caught me mid-snap and hissed, ""Not now!"" and nudged me towards the rest of the food. 

I stood at the end of the dessert corridor, taking in the scenery that unfolded before me. Bustling chefs and cooks replenishing trays to keep up with the hungry guests, people walking around with a plate in each hand piled mile-high with crab claws and prime rib, the steam rising from the rows and rows of hotel pans. This was it. I was never going to leave. 

I have to say, I think I ate about four plates of food. Four plates of food = 8 plates of regular-person food. My friends know I don't operate under moderation and I will use whatever plate real estate is available to me, and start stacking when I lose surface area.

Top two:

#1 I can't rave enough about the crab claws. They are sliced in half for you. Say what??!? I just literally scoop out the meat out of the shell half with a fork, or just slurp it up with my mouth if I'm too impatient even to deal with a fork. They were just the right amount of salty and sweet and I think I had about 20 legs.

#2 The prime rib was excellent. The guy cutting was really friendly and courteous. He also gave me food. Extra points for that. Anyone who gives me food is a friend. I asked for a rare piece, and rare piece is what I got. Every morsel of the bloody meat was delicious and I went back for seconds.

Honorable mentions:

Veal short rib. Juicy, tender, packed with flavors. I was a little sad some teenage kid before me took the entire tray on his plate and left me two pieces. By the time I got up for thirds, I was too full to eat more of the meats.

Pear arugula salad with blue cheese crumbles and field greens. Excellent subtle flavor with sweet slices of pear and grapes.

Crepes. Their crepes were humongous, and we shared two amongst 6 of us. The blueberry nutella cream crepe was my favorite. 

Desserts. After stuffing myself silly with all the regular food, the dessert station was a bit formidable because there were SO MANY. In any case, I still took one of each and sampled them with everyone else at the table. The mint chocolate chip mini cake was delicious. I was also highly amused by the shiny glitter on the red velvet cupcakes. So pretty! 

I leave this review with an excerpt from the Simpsons:

Waiter: And for you sir? 
Homer: All you can eat! All you can eat! 
Waiter: Now, when you're ready take this plate up and... 
Homer: [already at buffet taking out a steam tray]

I had the buffet on Friday afternoon and also during the late afternoon on Sunday.

Food - Choice of food for Sunday morning brunch is decent. I liked it better when they changed the dishes at 3:30PM. They introduced lamb, quail and multiple seafood dishes that included oysters and Alaskan crab legs. The crab legs were some of the best I've had in a buffet. The selection of food is comparatively smaller compared to some of the other buffets in Vegas, but Wynn scores in terms of quality over the others. They certainly have a wider selection of food for vegetarians. I knocked off a star since their live counters just weren't that interesting (also didn't see as many as were advertised).

Drinks - The unlimited drinks (limited selection) is great if you like Sangria's and Mimosas. I feel it's totally worth the $18 if you want to have 2 or more drinks!

Decor - The decor is very floral and colorful. The lighting is bright. I feel the ambience is perfect for the buffet because you can actually see you food and relish it. Certainly an upscale buffet feel to it.

Service - The service at Wynn (except at Wing Lei) has continued to amaze me. The Buffet is no exception to this. Our glasses were constantly refilled and our server was very attentive in clearing out plates or getting us new cutlery. She even remembered our order the second time we visited which amazed us considering the number of ppl visiting.

Overall, the buffet is certainly worth it and recommended by me if you can spare 2-3 hours!",0,0,0

The line is uber long, but the wait is all worthwhile once you see and taste the food. It's like waiting in line at disneyland, the lines wove around and around. 

The buffet is about 30 dollars but they have champagne brunch for 36 dollars as well. The champagne is good, they use Freixenet Champagne, which I like, and they also bring you orange juice for mimosas if you ask. The champagne is unlimited and we drank to our hearts content. 

The food is gourmet from Asian sushi and soups to Italian rissoto and pastas. The thing I found most interesting is that all the food is gourmet, but they had congee with pork sung!! That is the ultimate Vietnamese porridge and we ate that because it was so cheap!! I had to try a bowl and it was delicious. 

I had mostly breakfast food, but I also meandered to the Italian section to try the lamb rissoto and it is the best risotto i have ever had. I think I had 3 bowls of it. 

There is a whole dessert room that had different flavors of ice cream, eclairs, cupcakes, doughnuts, and cookies. You can get on a sugar high just being in this room. 

Even the coffee to sober up was good. I don't think I have anything bad to say about this buffet other than the lines, but it is understandable why is is so long now.

But unfortunately, this place did not live up to its name.  Every item we tried was either cold or only lukewarm.  I don't know if it was just a timing thing, but when I went through the line the first time, there were only one or two servings of certain items and I didn't see anyone taking out more hot foods to replace the leftover cold items.  I was excited to try the lamb, but was again disappointed as the lamb leg was dry and so were the slices of lamb roast that I had.  

Overall their food items were not flavorful enough.  Although they did have quite a variety of food items, none of the items were memorable.  The only items worth mentioning were their crab legs and cocktail shrimp.   IMO, they also didn't seem to have that much selection of desserts.  Chocolate covered marshmallows, rice crispy squares and small candied apples?!?!  What were they thinking?   For the price that we paid, I expected more fancy and exotic types of desserts.

Yes, there is a possibility of a long wait when you go. But stop complaining! Obviously there is a line because the food is GOOD. If you don't want to wait, go to Treasure Island and you'll go in with no wait... you whiny bitches.

The service was great. My family's waiter was friendly, and took our plates and refilled our drinks in timely fashion.

As for the food... I have to tell you, if you're on a diet, 
1) BREAK IT FOR THIS!
2) ... why are you in Vegas?
3) Then again, if you are, eat wisely. They have tastily-prepared vegetables and sweet, fresh fruits to balance your gorging. (:

Honestly, not everything will be perfect. There will be a few things that are just okay. Some are good and great. And the rest? Those foods were crafted to perfection. 

If you're a seafood person, you should definitely line up for their ginormous pile of fresh king crab legs. I've only gone to this buffet twice, but both times, there are tons of people who are willing to wait in the lines and fill up an entire plate or two with them (although, people like that, such as my parents, regret getting so much a bit after they remember there are other well-prepared foods surrounding them lol).

I'll be honest, when at buffets, I don't do the whole ""eat all I can"" thing with the appetizers and entrees. For me, it's all about the desserts. They have their homemade ice creams\/gelatos\/sorbets. Not only were there cookies and cakes... there were candied apples!

VARIETY
They have such a wide variety of cuisines from your standard prime rib to ethnic foods.  Everything from Indian, Italian, sushi, seafood, Chinese, Korean kimchee, Mexican, American and more.  What's nice about this buffet is that they use much smaller chaffing trays which forces the staff to replenish the food more frequently to keep things fresh.  Unlike most buffets, there are no duplicate stations, so be sure to make your round across the entire place.

THINGS TO TRY:
- Coconut Scallop Ceviche: This was so incredible delicious.  I have never had this, but it was so refreshing and tropical.  Delish!
- Fresh Seafood Area: Here they offer giant Alaskan King that are already sliced in half for you.  No need for crab crackers and pick.  Just pluck and eat.  This time around, it was a bit on the saltier side, but devourable.  They also featured giant prawns.  Sadly, no mussels.  They also did have a variety of poached fish throughout the area.
- Dessert: This is bar far the best.  I pigged out and had one of everything.  If you are a fan of reaching for the apple or cherry pie, jello wiggly surprise or chocolate chip cookie, then you might not enjoy this dessert bar.  Over the weekend, they featured the following: tiramisu, cr√®me brulee, triple chocolate mousse, chocolate banana parfait, key lime pie, Madeline's and so much more.  OH, they do have a build your own sundae, but figure that you can get that anytime and anywhere.

TIP #1: If you do come on a busy day, try coming before 6:00 or after 8:00 to beat the rush.

TIP #2: If you are a hotel guest of the Wynn or Encore, chances are that you will have a $75 room credit.  Apply your credit here and only pay $0.56 for a dinner for two.",1,1,1

The Buffet has an extravagant selection of food to choose from, and everything is presented very well. The selections are quite creative as well in contrast to most standard run-of-the-mill buffets.

Elvis sightings, the Bellagio fountains, flashing slot machines...and the buffet...food galore!

Of course that's a given at any buffet but only a few are particularly delicious-this is one of them.  In a garden-esque setting, it's one of the nicer buffets to sit and do some serious noshing.

Things to know before you go (for the better buffets):
*expect a long wait time (we waited an hour at lunch time)
*limit yourself with the breads & carbonated drinks-they'll fill you up!
*cost-it's probably one of the more expensive ones ($28 brunch, $37 dinner on F-S)
*wear loose clothing (for those expanding waistlines)
*go for a long walk afterwards...to help ya digest

Particularly good were the prime rib and the desserts...They even had congee. Yum.

I have only come here twice so it maybe hard to say if they still keep their five star status. Bellagio's once great buffet has be demoted down to three stars if you ask me. Here is how Wynn holds up:

Its absolutely amazing! The buffet line is extremely long and their deserts area is amazing. Decor within is beautiful, the food looks and tastes great. What more can you ask for? Of course, coming here for the seafood, the shrimps are large, the crab legs are delicious, and the prime rib. DId I mention the Prime Rib? Its absolutely delicious! Too Raw? Ask the chef to toss it on the grill to brown it up a lil, thats what my mom does at least. Service is fast, dishes are collected promptly and drinks are refilled right away. Thats service for you.

Overall, I give Wynn a 4.5 to almost 5. The food was DELICIOUS! Atmosphere was not too shabby compared to other vegas buffets, Its open and wide which I LIKE!

The Buffet is comparable to some off-Strip buffets at local casinos, except that it's high-end and the desserts are divine; however, despite a wide range of cuisines offered, choices are limited.

I don't know, maybe I'm just accustomed to Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal, and even my guilty pleasure buffet that serves the best orange chicken ever, but I was expecting a little more bang for my buck with this one. After all, it's The Wynn.

Aside from the desserts, I liked how there was a charcuterie section because sometimes you just want meat and cheese for dinner. The prime rib and cheddar brats were bomb, and so were the various veggie options available. Speaking of veggies, the salad offerings were sparse. If you're searching for a buffet with a strong seafood section, you might want to consider skipping this one all together and just head to Bacchanal for a seafood gorge-fest. 

The service here was fantastic and much more attentive and friendly than most buffets that I've visited.

For lunch, the offerings were dull and nothing was especially tasty. It was generally very average, which is not what I pay $30 for. Run of the mill pastas that looked like they had been sitting out for too long (true of a lot of the food actually), lots of bread as filler, uninspired desserts with lame ice cream flavors (and no gelato). Carving station was decent and fresh, and the cured meats were high quality. That's about it.

We were so disappointed that we went to the Wicked Spoon a few days later to get our buffet fix, which only amplified how inferior the Wynn was in comparison.

Prime Rib was good.  Their lamb was excellent with lamb ribs, lamb tbone steak, and lamb stew.  I tried a small piece of their sea bass and that was excellent as well.  King crab legs was delicious.  So was the smoke salmon.  Everything was so well made, tasteful, and fresh.  I've tried most of the buffets in Vegas and this is by far the best.

However, why was seating the guests a mess!  We pay, stand by the actual hostess stand for like another 10-15 minutes.  I don't get it.  Is it that hard to sit down customers?  They have a few hostesses go back and forth to sit down the guests.  At one point, there were three hostesses standing around.  Some how, this system has to change.

Now for the food.  As we goto our table, we pass by the buffet line.  I was looking forward to this as I was reading this was the place to be vs the one at the Bellagio.  Tons of food out, all sorts of ethnicities and flavors going on.  So we get to our table and I had right over to the sushi and seafood booth.  Sadly enough, their sushi selection was poor.  They had four types of rolls out and that's about it.  Nothing special at all.  As we turn the corner, I was pleased to see a huge tray of shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp was not over done, served cold, and done just right.  Right next to this were the king crab legs, wow.  They are already split in half and all you have to do is pull out the meat.  Great stuff here, couldn't complain, although it would have been nice if it was served warm, but whatever.

So after devouring the crab legs and shrimp, I decide to explore a little.  I walk down to the other end and find some veal short ribs, which were only OK, picked up a piece of their seabass, which was awesome, and kept browsing around for more.  When I mean ""more,"" I thought there would be a better selection of meats and other seafood, but no.  They had a rib roast sitting out, which I got and was decent.  Next to it was a turkey, which they carve for you there.  A colleague of mine got a ""slice.""  What I mean is they got a thick slice, who slices turkey, especially white meat at about 1\/2"" thick???  So again, the food selection wasn't what I had expected.  I want to mention though that the Chinese section had some sweet and sour shrimp, which was very good, not your ordinary ""joe blow"" Chinese lunch box style shrimp.

The desserts were all pretty decent.  Nothing spectacular.  They are all small bites, so I suggest you try them all.  Of the batch I got, I have to say the creme brulee was my favorite, but not at all the best I've had.  The crepes were a huge disappointment.  I got the apple one and it was nearly raw granny smith apples.  I don't like a tart tasting crepe, sorry.  Service was decent, servers came by and picked up your empty plates and our waiter came around to refill our drinks.  Nothing to complain about here.

Overall, the decor of this place is great and the Wynn did a good job keeping the buffet tables clean and you know you're going to eat some decent quality food.

So, I'll use that as the first metric: I got three slices of prime rib at the Wynn, it was soft, juicy, red rare, and cut almost 3\/4 inch thick. And the butt end was well-herbed and just a touch crispy. Damn fine stuff.

We spend over two hours here, sampling the whole array (except crab legs -- I'm allergic). Another staple, the shrimp cocktail, was jumbo and succulent and lacking that awful freezer burn that poorer buffets have. Other fish, including the sea bass and the three of four ceviche samplers, were all well above average. The clams with red sauce were a little better than average, but hey -- clams! The buffet sushi experiment was less successful. My instinct (stay away from buffet sushi) stands uncorrected.

The gorging potential was fantastic. Sticking to the proteins, there were cute cornish game hens that were only a touch dry, and sliced turkey that would have been better if slicer guy would have given me some dark meat. I had heard fine things about the lamb, but the lamb was not fine my friends. Both chops I sampled were way overcooked. Alas.

I had some asparagus that was also much better than expected, very nicely grilled. zucchinis and squashes, also grilled, assisted in padding all the meat in my gullet.

Carbs? desserts? No idea.

Bottomline: Don't come here for lunch. 

While the variety of food may seem plenty, it really isn't. Let's count:
1) Salad \/ soup 
2) Cheese and salami 
3) ""Seafood"" (blackened salmon, red snapper)
4) Pizza
5) Italian (mac and cheese, ravioli)
6) Bread
7) Meat (no prime ribs, only beef\/pork\/turkey)
8) American (fried chicken)
9) Bread (that's right, 2nd bread station that looks exactly like #6)
10) Mexican (quesadilla, tamales)
11) Chinese (fried rice, potstickers)
12) Fruit \/ yogurt
13) Sushi (california rolls)
14) Bagels 
15) Desserts

Each station has about 3-4 items and half the items look unappealing. The seemingly okay looking ones taste pretty bland. In fact, good luck chewing anything you put into your mouth. Obviously this place doesn't really care about the lunch eaters as they churn out uninspiring crap from the kitchen. Even the desserts were almost inedible -- I have never seen such poor selection of desserts and they taste horrible as well. Spend your money elsewhere or wait until dinner buffet.",4,0,0

My favorite dishes were the quinoa and brussel sprout salads, crab legs, rack of lamb, and charcuterie selection.

Note that traditional eaters who want the 'usual' buffet fare might be disappointed, as almost everything here has some kind of twist or modification to make it stand out from the pack.

Dessert selection kind of lacked the 'wow' factor I was expecting, although the tres leches and creme brulee were yummy. I didn't try the crepe station, a decision I now regret. :( 

The lines were really out of control. 45 minute wait in the regular line and 20 minute wait in the 'VIP' line. Although, it's not their fault they're popular.

My only real complaint is the service. Our waitress seemed depressed and was very inattentive, visiting only once to give us our drinks and another time to refill them, never asking if we needed anything else or how our meal was going. The bulk of our service came from the busboys, a pattern repeated at the Wynn's other restaurants during our stay.",0,0,0

This place has finally surpassed the Bellagio as the place to pig out.  Because of this fact, getting in to the Wynn buffet is the biggest hurdle.  Expect to stand in line for 60+ min at any given time.

However once granted admission, you will be rewarded with a schmorgasborg of yumminess.  Huge selection with really tasty dishes.  Biggest highlight for us was the pre-sliced Alaskan king crab legs...They are perfectly spliced in half so all you have to do is stick a fork in and you have instant access to huge chunks of crab meat.  Couple that with the drawn butter and you are in tastebud heaven....mmmmm....sorry, I lost track of myself....Let me stop salivating and continue here.  Other buffet highlights include the desserts.  We liked the cupcake bar...not the best cupcakes but pretty good and unique that they even had it.

While I enjoyed almost everything I tried, there are a few exceptions, both good and bad. I come from the land of 10,000 lakes but any fresh seafood outside of fish is pretty hard to come by. With that said, I loved their fresh shrimp! Some cocktail sauce, lemon if needed and I'm content to eat just that. I also enjoyed the roasted turkey from the carving station and the desserts were a sweet lovers dream. Pretty sure my sister went into a diabetic coma from all the sugar! 

However, all good things must come to an end. I have two minor complaints about the buffet. First, the restaurant was half empty since it was a Thursday evening, but our server was MIA for quite a bit of time. We had a table of six, and he would end up having to fill three or four of our drinks each time he came by because he had disappeared for awile. Finally, my other issue with this place was the lack of side dishes. There were mashed potatoes, and a couple dishes of vegetables, but not much else. When I'm in a meat paradise, I'd like to have a few options to pair it with, and this seemed to be lacking here.

We only came here because we had a seating at Jersey Boys at 7pm and didn't want to venture too far from the Palazzo, boy what a disappointment, especially since they marked it up to $46 because it was Labor Day weekend.  I had come here once before with my dad when the Wynn opened and we both preferred the Bellagio buffet then as well, but I at least thought the prime rib here was excellent as well as the King Crab legs.

Well, what a surprise... they didn't even have King Crab Legs, and this was after asking the cashier if they had them tonight and she said yes!  The prime rib was NOT rare and it wasn't as tender as the Bellagio's.  Also it was very bland, it felt more like we were eating roast beef than prime rib.  My fiance tried this slice of lamb leg, wow that was dry... we both tried the rack of lamb which was charred on the outside, but it was so bland as well.  This is one of my favorite dishes to make at home too, what a disappointment.  The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was much smaller and didn't seem as fresh as Bellagio's.  

The few positives over the Bellagio... less wait in line for starters.  The ambiance was a little nicer, overall the place is brighter.  The dessert section was superior to Bellagio's, but cmon we did not pay $46 a person to feast on desserts.  I like both the white espresso and chocolate mint gellato and the creme brulee was very tasty.

I am juggling whether to rate this 2 or 3 stars, seeing that it failed though with the prime rib and other meats and not having king crab either, the borderline call drops to 2 stars.  Overall, very disappointed and will probably not be back again.

The wait for this buffet can be up to an hour, but trust me it's actually worth it.

Even though it's a buffet everything remains classy.  The food options are endless.  I was so full by the time I was done and I didn't even get to try everything on the menu.  They have a gigantic dessert area too.

The place (the hotel) is newer and the interior of the restaurant is nice and clean with high ceiling and decorative flowers. Bellagio's looks old and dark, and I must say, looks like cheap buffet. 

Wynn's food tastes better and has better quality than Bellagio's.

If you're looking for sushi, don't eat Bellagio's. Their sushi is too big and too stuffy, not to mention the worse taste. 

Wynn's ice cream looks and tastes more expensive, while Bellagio's looks like cheap fast food ice cream. Wynn's use appropriate ice cream container, with the servers scooping your choice of flavor, they have 6 ot 7 flavors, while Bellagio only uses the fast food ice cream machine, where you pull down the metal thing and the ice cream will come down. Bellagio only has 3 flavors.

Don't forget to eat Wynn's bacon!!!! It tastes as good as Texas' famous BBQ!

Wynn's shrimp cocktail is fresher than Bellagio's, and Bellagio's salad is not as complete as Wynn's in terms of vegetable variety.

Wynn's price is $5-6 more expensive than Bellagio's, but you get better food, better atmosphere, and better experience!",2,0,0

Since we came here a few days before Christmas, the restaurant had a special holiday menu and the food was especially well-crafted. Here is a short list of the things they had: ahi tuna, crab legs, prime rib, ribs, lamb, pumpkin ravioli, sushi, cod in pesto sauce, charcuterie, arugula salad with manchego.

The different assortment of higher quality food (for a buffet) was excellent.  However, I was conflicted with giving it 3 stars because of the service.  It took a long time for my girlfriend and I to get a glass of water.  Then afterwards, they forgot about our refills even though we repeatedly asked.  Busy or not, this shouldn't be tolerated.  Also there was a gnat in my girlfriend's food.  This could have been from the floral arrangements located around the buffet.  They did give us a free glass of champagne for that, however, the service was still abysmal.  

If you can put the service aside though, the food was great, the desserts were average with ice creams, cakes, and other goodies you would find at a buffet.  If you want to try items such as lamb, rabbit pasta, and other entrees you wouldn't usually find at other buffets, then try this out.",3,2,2

So a lot...and I mean a LOT...of peeps have been giving really positive reviews about the buffet at Wynn, so on a recent holiday trip to Vegas, this was to be the culinary highlight of our stay.

***Ambience***
Really beautiful decor with lots of ornate flower arrangements.  However, the rest of the dining room was more functional than elegant.

***Food***
At around $46 a person, the quality of food was rather lackluster.  The prime rib and rack of lamb were quite bloody and tough.  You'd think a classy joint like the Wynn would at minimum dry-age their roast a few days (at least!  go watch that Alton Brown episode, Wynn!), but you'd be mistaken.  

Although their other entrees were varied and creative, they were either dry, extremely salty, or both.  The Cantonese -style clams in fermented black bean sauce might as well have been a big ole salt lick.  The buffet line was quite long, so by the time you get to what you want, the items already on your plate have cooled off quite a bit, so perhaps several trips to the line is in order if you prefer your warm food exactly that -- warm.

Seafood was uninspiring.  Sure...you got crab legs...and they're cooked quite well meaning they aren't overly salty like other places on the Strip.  The shrimps were quite large.  Smoked salmon was left out too long, so had to endure dry edges.  

Dessert?  What dessert?  Read on...

***Service***
We got to the Wynn at around 7:30'ish and was burning the batteries on our iPhones trying to keep entertained for the hellacious 2 hour wait.  At around 9:30PM, we finally started our buffet experience.  Now, I know the posted hours say that the buffet ends at 10:00PM, but does that mean you start pulling the food from the steam tables at 10?  Wouldn't a classy joint like the Wynn find it courteous to wait at least an hour after the last patrons start eating before closing shop?  I felt REALLY bad for the huge line of peeps behind us who basically paid $46 for a rushed soup kitchen experience.  Needless to say, the only thing for dessert we could acquire was ice cream, which the server repeatedly got wrong and literally slammed the bowls on the counter top.  Only redeeming thing about the service was that our waiter was quite nice and accommodating...for the first 15 minutes of our late dinner before he disappeared.  Oh...and I f*cking hate it when soda refills are stored in pitchers where they spend the night going flat and getting diluted from melting ice...

***Summary***
Spend your hard-earned money and priceless time elsewhere...the Wynn is really a ""Loss""...all hype...",1,0,0

I overheard this guy asking the cook who was working in the kitchen where the veal was, and the cook was like, ""I am putting some more out right now. I will be ready soon"". I guess that guy didn't hear what the cook was saying and he was like ""where is the veal? This is some good shit over here!""  Eating veal is wrong. 

Their crab legs were salty. I guess they wanted to limit people from eating a lot? I don't know, but I didn't like it. But I had my share of lamb. I think I alone had about 8 pieces. I just want back again and again for it. They are so delicious with the creamy horseradish sauce. 

I think buffet just goes so well with the overall theme of Vegas. It is wasteful and shoving down food down your throat is just plain stupid. I did eat a lot more than I usually do kinda like thanksgiving, but I enjoyed every single bite of it. oh yea. Don't eat veal.",0,0,0

You are paying most of your money into their very nice service and a great environment without a doubt.  Their food selection is great, ranging from cuisines from their choice of meat to their dessert selection. Their prime rib slice is very well done, along with their other meat that requires cutting from the chef.  The Chinese section has a small variety ranging from buns to fried rice, but they do have the think duck slice Bread ÁâáÁöÆÈ∏≠but I don't recommend it.
Their sushi selection is at best, minimal selection, and there's not one that sparks an interest once you eaten it once. Raw oyster is also available, but you cannot see the chef opening the oyster shell like ""Salty"" none the less is eatable but I would pass on that also. 
Here comes the crab leg, most of the leg are frozen and defrosted, you could still see the thin ice on top of the meat, there's not much flavor, it requires butter for taste but the frozen ice makes the butter thin, ruining the taste.
The dessert section is great and they are very helpful in terms of helping you choose a dessert that you like, actually all of the chefs are there to help you out.

i discovered the dessert section and i already knew i would no longer fit into my clubbing dress. i think i grabbed almost everything because it all looked sooo good. the chocolate ice cream had chunks of chocolate in it..yummy...and the creme brulee...well, i had two plates of that on top of all my food, and the fruit were all fresh and juicy too. i tried yellow watermelon here for the first time ever and it was GOOD.

All I kept hearing when I told people I was going to Vegas was to hit up Wynn's buffet. That it was ""amazing"" and ""delicious"" and ""[insert other awesome adjectives to describe their food]."" So of course the day of checkout, we decided to eat here. Now I know you're gonna say that we should've gone for lunch\/dinner because the food selection is better and blah blah blah. But by this time, GUAP had been lost at the slots and we were in conservation mode so that meant breakfast buffet. 

Moving on... the space is beautiful. Fresh flowers everywhere. But I didn't expect anything less from the Wynn. They have their aesthetics down pat. What I didn't like was their dress code policy. My brother had to walk all the way back to our suite at the Encore to change out of his beater\/tank. I mean I get it that you guys wanna keep it classy, but when I look over at the table next to me with a woman wearing basically a napkin over her breasts... kinda defeats the purpose ay? Might wanna fine tune that policy. 

Anyways you would think that breakfast buffet foods would be limited because that's what I thought. But not here! Pretty amazing variety of foods offered here. Friggin awesome! From different fruit salads to eggs Benedict with salmon to scrambled egg whites to plain old fruit loops for the kids. However their dessert area is by far the most impressive. I probably took something from each area: gelato, cake, cookie, cupcake, mousse, etc. Yes, I'm a foodie. Tis why I'm a Yelper. Duh! Now granted I didn't eat everything that I took. I just sampled and if I didn't like it, I'd set it aside. Some may argue that that's wasteful. Bitch, we're at a buffet. It's all wasteful.

utensils they used were nice. the knife was realllly heavy. the plates were really pretty and clean. none of the ones i used had chips on them!

the pineapple juice i ordered was SO GOOD.

i recommend the spicy tuna handroll, different types of ceviche, pesto pasta you can make at the pasta station, smoked salmon, and the prime rib.

crabs were freakishly SALTY ~__~ ahhhhh. blegh. buffalo chicken wings (why would i get this at a buffet. i laugh at myself) was toooooo sweet, pad thai (again why would i get this at a buffet -__-"") was...bland. seriously had no flavor what-so-ever. chicken panang had this really overwhelming coconut taste... this baked salmon dish was so dryyy ): pea cream sauce tortellini was way too sweet and so was the shredded bbq pork on the corn bread. i felt like overall, the food was on the sweet side o__o

on to deserts,
AHHHHH i was in love. creme brulee, tiramisu, panna cotta, strawberry shortcake, liege waffles and crepes that they make on the spot! those are all recommendable.

the only ones i was disappointed with were candied apple ( it looked so pretty and enticing but...hard much? -__-"" so HARD to bite into. no pun intended ha) and the madeleine cookie...was not good AT ALL.

He was lucky that there was no wait at all that day, we just walked in, paid and got seated within 10 minutes, otherwise, we would go to a regular restaurant in stead.

I ordered a Sierra Nevada, and a Bloody Mary before I went to get some food. This place is huge, I am very bad at directions, I couldn't remember and find my seat, our waiter had to come to get me. That's another reason I don't do buffet in Vegas, I get lost....

I liked the cold appetizers, lots of varieties, lots of vegan dishes, shellfish was good too. Seafood dishes were delicious, I tried a few, they were all good. They had sushi, Chinese stir fried noodles, yummy soups, bread, I really liked the pizza, cheese and veggie ones were so good, I couldn't stop eating them. 

The food was delicious with lots of verieties, but I don't think I needed all that, carving stations were the best, the thing is I don't eat meat, so I missed out the best part, hubby was so happy with prime rib... Yuk... I just kept eating mixed olives and pizza, sipping on my Bloody Mary... 

For lunch $35 a person, plus beer and Bloody Mary, our waiter didn't put my Bloody Mary in there, of course we had to give him a $20 tip for that, so we didn't really save any money, still around $90, it's a casual lunch or brunch value for us in Vegas. But I don't need to walk so much to get food and get lost at a regular restaurant!

Passed desert section, I didn't even try to go there to get some deserts, cause I was really tired and grumpy from the walking and getting food... Hubby got me something, chocolate mousse, cheese cake, they were yummy. 

I told hubby, no more buffet! Next time you want it, you go drive to a lunch buffet by yourself, I am just gonna stay in my comfy bed and order room service. :)

TWO dinner buffets were $85. When we walked in, the buffet looked huge, but once you actually go to the counter and look at the selection it's actually very limited. They have your usual fillers like bread before each station to break up the buffet counters to make it look like there's more selection. There were a couple of fancy sounding dishes that were less than mediocre. Overall, selection was limited for the price you pay. The best thing  there seriously is the PRIME RIB and while the dessert showcase seems impressive initially--once you taste it, it's actually pretty bad. I had a mint chocolate cupcake that tasted like it was iced with toothpaste. 

Pros: 
1) Prime rib
2) Crepe station
3) Crab legs and shrimp

Problem is that there are two on each side, so if you go to the one closest to the part of the line you are standing at, someone else goes to the one beyond yours and potentially ends up in line to enter the restaurant before you.  

It's so disorganized just to get through the cashier line and is so congested with people that by the time you are seated, it feels like you've already been through an adventure.  

The food was ok, not worth whatever it would have cost to pay full price.  As much as I try to like other buffets, Bellagio and the M Resort are my tops.  While the Wynn was a winner at slots, it was a loser at the buffet, other than desserts.",0,0,0

I started all the way on the right and made me way through the buffet. There was plenty of choices and I got pretty excited to see a small bowl of kimchee. The food that I grabbed tasted pretty good and I went back for seconds.

Then I went to the dessert area. There were lots of cute desserts that I haven't seen at other buffets before and I saw two gluten-free desserts.

I was more than happy to pay this, expecting an epic meal to satisfy my hungry tummy. There was a small line when we got there, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. 

One thing's for sure, this buffet is beautifully decorated. The ambiance is great. Eating here, I definitely felt fancy. Just wish I felt the same about the food. For the price we paid, the selection wasn't that great. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was worth the $80 we paid. The server was pleasant, but we had to ask and wait for her to bring us napkins and water refills. 

The dessert selection was amazing, though! Lots of items to choose from! My boyfriend had tapped out and was passing on dessert so I had to tackle the dessert section on my own. If I could afford to, I would definitely have gotten one of everything. But, instead I chose a few to share -- passionfruit tapioca pudding, rocky road cake, blueberry cheesecake, and my fave, creme brulee! All so delicious!

Extra cost on Saturday dinner for the duck buns, which you have to ask for (they are not placed out for the taking). The buns were good but not worth the upgrade. Seafood was good, but we tasted better and sweeter crab legs the next day at Wicked Spoon. Carving station was a bust. A lot of the meat were dry and well done (painful for those who prefer medium rare and medium). On a Saturday night, we were surprised that there was no wait at all. Perhaps a sign? Dinner was $50 per person. Despite the letdown from the food, our server as great, friendly, and attentive. Her service was worth 5 stars.

The drinks they make such as their red and white sangria to their signature cocktail berry blossom were really strong! They did not skimp or water down the drinks! It was quite worth the money to spend on if you're looking for food and drinks. What better way to do that than a buffet?! YUMMMM...

They had a variety of stations but compared to other buffets such as Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, it was quite small. Although it might be small, the quality of food is delicious!!!!

Not that much selection, but was still good! The Asian selection, pork pun, duck bun, fried rice, beef, and tofu with eggplant. Theres also a street taco section, carvings of ham, roast beef, turkey. Some southern soul food such as fried chicken, mashed potatoes, greens, Mac n cheese, and etc. They also have salad and soup, cheese and bread. One of my biggest ahhhh moment was the corn!!!

If there are no rules against eating (or sleeping) around, a man is going to keep trying new dishes (or women) until his body can't take it anymore. 

Eating at the Hometown Buffet is sort of like womanizing on the lowest level. The food is high in quantity, but low in quality. You end up eating a lot of dry fried chicken, greasy processed tacos, and melted frozen yogurt topped with high fructose corn syrup. Yuck.

So when it comes womanizing, you are essentially taking home girls with an abundance of tattoos, drug problems, and daddy issues. Hot. Kidding. Well, sort of.

Eating at the Buffet at the Wynn is womanizing at the highest level. Every food station is a high caliber, high quality meal in itself. You enjoy freshly made Caeser salad, delicious chicken soup, and the fresh fish of the day. Yum.

That is kind of like dating a very pretty girl, with a slim figure, educated, ambitious, kind, thoughtful, and with a good family background. This would satisfy just about any man. But a man is only faithful as his options. 

At the Buffet at the Wynn, you have the option(s) of continuing on to the next food station(s) and enjoying another classy culinary experience like fresh Tom Yum soup, fresh crab legs, and a dessert station you have to see to believe. So you end up pretty girlfriend with a hot mistress, a hot mistress to your hot mistress, and a hot mistress to your hot mistress' hot mistress. If that makes any sense.

So if you are in Las Vegas and want to eat a buffet, you can pay $20 and go to Hometown Buffet (aka the Excalibur Buffet) or you can drop $40 and visit the Buffet at the Wynn. You can take the Tiger Woods approach. Or you can take the Derek Jeter approach. Two athletes. Both rich. Both ugly. But one has a ""hit list"" that rivals that of James Bond.

The one reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.  They have more variety now than the first time I went (around 3 years ago), but I can see some people wanting more.  For example, they had 2 types of salad the day I went: caesar, and smoked salmon.  They had a few other dressings (bleu cheese, italian, and something else), and both salads were great, but sometimes you want to build your own salad with all sorts of additions that the Wynn lacked.

The few soups that were served were very interesting (I think one was a pumpkin soup), but I didn't see anyone get them!  I think they were a little too ""different,"" and they should stick to normal.  A few years ago they had this amazing cream of asparagus soup, I was sad they didn't have that this time.

Prime rib was amazing, spicy tuna hand roll was very, very good, and the cheese ravioli was the best pasta even though it was the simplest.  I can't remember much more, but those were the standouts.  I was really disappointed in their mashed potatoes and other sides\/veggies... strange thing to say, but I expect better, especially after Bellagio's pesto mashed potatoes!

Now, the dessert is what SHOULD get the Wynn 5 stars!  Homemade ice cream and sorbet that truly rivals Haagen Daaz, Dreyers, and any other famous ice cream maker.

PROS: They have lot of flowers here. It really is one of the most beautiful dining rooms you will ever see.

Thier jumbo shrimp was very good, very fresh and only lightly cooked - perfect.

The fried rice and noodles were Ok.

I really liked some of the desserts.

The wait staff (as opposed to the host\/seating staff) are nice.

CONS: Long lines to get seated. Over an hour of waiting at some times of day. The staff managing the seating process and line are not terribly friendly. They need to be  sent to the Disneyland school for managing long lines of cranky hungry people waiting hours for food.

No crab legs at lunch, at least not the day I was there. They brought these out for the dinner service.

Awful production line Peking Duck. Practically loaded with a full tree of cilantro, instead of a couple of leaves.

Very cold sushi, probably good from a buffet food safety perspective, but not so much for taste.

I was also impressed that they offered a number of gluten-free and vegan options among the 18 different pork products and the pastry\/pancake\/dessert mega-stations.  

Remember to show up early and ask nicely to be seated in the atrium.  It's a necessary part of the experience.",2,1,1

We started with a small cheese\/salami plate made up and tomato, mozzarella basil salad.. Both yum. The chicken noodle soup was also delicious.. Had a duck bun, prime rib, turkey leg, honey fried chicken, seaweed salad, crab legs, sweet asparagus, guacomole, sweet potato, tuna poke and by then I was pretty much full!! I had just enough room to try a couple of desserts, the vanilla ice-cream and the passionfruit tapioca cup was DELISH!

When I arrived with the other girl in our party we were told that we had to stand in the regular Non-VIP line before we could stand in the (equally long) ""VIP"" line. Huh? Whats the point of the VIP line then? We were told that our party was already seated and when we asked if we could just pay and go ahead and sit with our party... they flat out REFUSED. 

They told us that we had to wait 25-30 minutes in the line with everyone else even though we were going to sit at a table that was ALREADY TAKEN. It's not like we were waiting for a new table. 

The management was indifferent and didn't care. He simply said, flatly and in a monotone ""I apologize for your concerns"". Concerns?! Wow, could he care any less? We even offered him our credit cards and said that they could charge us right then and there, but still they refused to accept them and said that we had to wait in line. The management then said that if the other girls had paid for us outright then we wouldnt have had to wait. When we asked if our friends could pay for us now, they said NO.

When they seated us they said there is a two hour limit that we can be at the table.

The other thing that caused me to change my review is that the normally $40 Saturday night buffet was changed to $48 because it was a ""holiday week"".

Check with the front hostess and see if the Korean BBQ Ribs are being served that day.

Why?
MUCH nicer atmosphere (it really is beautiful in there)
Far better desert bar
More bread products
Service was a bit better
A bit nicer layout of the food itself (most of the food is put out on small dishes so it looks more gourmet- maybe it isn't but it worked for me)

TIP (that we did): Like other people have mentioned- Go in right before 3:30, pay for the lunch, and stay for dinner (they don't kick anyone out when they change to dinner)- we had appetizers with their lunch menu and then really went to work when the dinner food came out (PS the dinner food is far better).

If you do this, you feel way better about spending 30ish on a meal (this price might have just been for the easter weekend menu) and then you eat the biggest meal of the day earlier (better for you) and barely need much more food later...we stayed for 2.5 hours, it was awesome. 

Now, it's not like everything was unbelievably good, but I think even with the best of the best buffets, not everything will be amazing. 

What stood out (combo of lunch and dinner items)?
-T-bone lamb with ginger (AMAZING)
-sushi was pretty good\/decent (only cali and vege rolls though), though the rice was cold aka it'd been stored for a while
-ribs were great
-the dumplings were REALLY good & the egg rolls were pretty good too
-mashed potatoes
-apparently the turkey was amazing, though I didn't get to try it
-jerk chicken with mango chutney
-pizza - super thin, basic, but pretty good
-mini baguettes were so good- i stole 2 and they were also good later on in the evening, in case you were wondering
-mini olive bread rolls
-handmade ice cream bar (with assorted good toppings)
-key lime tarts
-crepes i thought were pretty good- not amazing though
-creme brule (AMAZING)

Our service was also fantastic. They refilled our drinks ridiculously quickly and accurately. 

My vegetarian friend also seemed to really enjoy it.

We went on the weekend, where they offer a champagne buffet for a few dollars more. I think the regular price was around $33\/person (on a holiday weekend) and if you wanted the champagne with your buffet, it was around $40\/person. Keep in mind that if you hit the breakfast\/lunch pricing, or go during the week, it is a bit cheaper. Going on the weekend will increase the price, and dinner is always a few dollars more. This is all pretty standard in Vegas buffet pricing, unless you are eating at a Fremont St. buffet -  then I wouldn't pay more than $8 or so per person. 

We went on a Saturday around 1 pm (the day before Easter to be exact), and we waited in line for about 15 minutes before we paid and were seated. We chose to get the buffet WITHOUT champagne, since we were still pretty hungover from the night before. When we handed our ticket to the hostess, she took several tables at a time to their seats. Very efficient. However, when they sat us, they mixed up our party with another party of 2, and our ticket was marked as if we had paid the higher price for the champagne buffet! Woo hoo! So even though we were hung over, you know we couldn't pass that up!

Food wise, this place has everything. If you can't fill up on food you like here, there is seriously no hope for you. Loved the seafood station, especially when they brought out the giant crab legs! Eventually there becomes a line for these, but it is well worth the wait. Love that they are sliced open for you - it eliminates half the work! We got our money's worth in crab legs alone I'm pretty sure.

The other food stations include sushi, Italian, freshly sliced meats, and way way more! The desserts are in a separate section and they all look so perfect that you almost don't want to eat them. Almost. There is also a full serve crepes station which looked pretty awesome! Everything is clean & delicious & well worth whatever price you pay. This place is a splurge, and there are definitely cheaper places on the strip, but this is a gem for sure :)

At $50-ish per person, it isn't cheap but it came comped with my room so that made it a no brainer.

They've got the typical variety of food but it was all largely very good quality stuff. 

Where as at a typical buffet you might have a salad bar - a Cesar salad and some other run of the mill salad with a bunch of vegetable bins -  here you have your choice of quinoa salads, beet salads, asian chicken salad, etc. Basically its a buffet but the dishes are things you might order at a higher end restaurant so it isn't just higher quality ingredients.

The crab legs line was out of control, people were loading their plates up to the top with crab legs and then holding the mountain down with the other hand to prevent the legs from flying off. Kind of hilarious..i mean...you can come back for more sooo whats the deal...? 

The dessert station is pretty sweet. Lots of little shooters and little cakes so you can try a dozen different ones without feeling like a fat turd after wards. They were mostly very good too!

The sushi\/sashimi was the only bummer. I don't even remember seeing any sashimi and the rolls were strangely tiny with a tiny bit of fish in there. I ended up skipping it and you should too. No point in filling up on a roll of rice and seaweed.

So yes, that includes you Jimmy. Typically, I envision long lines of fat people slowly herding their way through some stoffers-a-riffic cuisine. However, this buffet was different. 

It started with the 20-30 foot tall fresh fruit sculptures that were meticulously manicured. I dunno...something about a 2 foot diameter banana sphere 30 feet in the air is just awesome. This sight was then seconded by the mere $7 addition for all you could drink bubbly + bloodys for brunch. Did it make us stay there for a total of 2 hours and drink way too much at brunch? Yes. That brings me to another point though - the wait staff was perfectly content to let us sit there for 2 hours and drink their quasi-free booze. We were never once hustled out of our seats...another vegas buffet oddity. 

The food at the buffet? Not too bad...massive selection, and *slab bacon* bitches! In general, better than average buffet food. Amazing dessert bar.

Stood through the usual line and was seated in requested dining area. I was underwhelmed by the brunch buffet, and would only consider visiting for normal lunch or dinner. We paid ~$33\/person. For this, I would rather go out for a nice brunch where I can specify a dish and it be made to order for me. It felt like this brunch buffet's dazzle effect wore off.

The atmosphere was clean and service responsive. The main buffet area is dimly lit which makes me feel like I'm walking into a cave, or a recovery bubble after a long ""Vegas"" night. Overall the stations are kept clean and well stocked.

There were a number of stations dedicated to breakfast offerings such as fresh pancakes, eggs and egg whites, bacon, french toast, and smoked salmon and bagels. Consider coming here on a weekday if you would like to avoid these dishes.

Now back to lunch. There was two soup offerings. There were salad options including a glass filled with cherry tomatoes, celery and carrots. The celery had brown on it. There was a mescaline, red beet and tangerine salad in individual serve dishes. There was a charcuterie areas with two types of cheeses and two types of salamis; smoked mozzarella and a plain looking yellow cheddar. This was really disappointing because I can get these offerings at home from a supermarket.

The meat offerings were carved ham, carved prime rib and carved turkey breast. All of these meats were delicious and I would say highlights of the buffet. Seafood was limited; only bulk shrimp were available. There were a variety of ""international"" stations as well; Asian with wontons and a congee stand; Mexican inspired, and Japanese with sushi. 

The variety is great, but none of the dishes were amazing, which defeats the purpose of having such a variety. An example of this is the shrimp tempura sushi. There was very little shrimp tempura and avocado and A LOT of rice. No one eats maki rolls for the rice! I would have preferred to see a number of well executed dishes, vs. a few highlights and a bunch of mediocre food for the masses reminiscent of standards that nice Chinese buffets now even surpass.

Dessert stations was very large. My favorite was the bread pudding - hands down best of the mini desserts. All of these mini cakes look very beautfiul and appealing, but they don't taste amazing or like desserts worth eating. This go around they had a raspberry cake, strawberry shortcake, chocolate cake, etc. Another notable dessert was a tapioca pudding with a passion fruit glaze- yum!",5,1,1

On weekday nights they close at 10 and take in the food at 10:30 so service starts to get a little slow because I'm assuming everyone wants to go home and has side works they need to finish.

I would suggest getting there no later than 8:00pm so you can relax and enjoy your dinner. (I kind of felt like we were being rushed)

Homemade Caesar salad station, every fruit you could possibly want plus fruit salads and these amazing little cups of fresh grapefruit segements with mint and brown sugar....seriously sooo freakin good. The Italian station had these flatbread pizzas that looked like nothing special, but tasted delicious, breakfast items and omelette stations (not just one) were also extremely tasty, pulled pork sliders on corn bread muffins are something you rarely see at a buffet, genius. The dessert room was impressive, small gourmet little noshes made so you could indulge in more then one or three :) Homemade gelato that was too die, I had the coconut by the way.

- They offer Indian food - chana masala and a lentil dish sort of but not similar to toor dal.  It was the only thing I tried that was seasoned.

After a 45 minute wait in line, we definitely built up a big appetite. I was excited to try the Wynn buffet, especially after running into our friends who were on their way back from the Wynn. They managed to wake up at 9am on Sunday to head over there for brunch. I'm sorry, but I need at least 5 hours of sleep! One of the girls was eating a shiny red candied apple that looked so good. I couldn't believe she got it from the buffet. The Bellagio buffet didn't offer candied apples!

While waiting in line, cocktail waitresses actually came around with little bottles of water, which was greatly appreciated. It helped ease my growling stomach. This time, we decided to do the $30 regular brunch instead of the champagne or Bloody Mary brunch although it was only a few dollars more. 

The atrium was nicely lit but the only tables available for two was right by the entrance, so we decided to sit in the main dining area. The nice thing about this buffet was that each area had a sign above it, so it was easy to locate everything. Because when you're hungry and know what you want, you don't want to go around looking for it. 

I was really happy with the variety, including the Asian food selections, and the carving station had bacon as well as prime rib. My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing straight out of the oven. All other desserts were ok.

I was really impressed by our server, who was really attentive. Our friends had recommended that we have their hot chocolate, so I made sure to get a cup. It was so good, especially topped with whipped cream. 

The couple who we sat next to also raved about the Wynn buffet, telling us that they made it a point to dine there every time they were in town. They said their dinner buffet was better though, just as most buffets are.

The selection is pretty incredible. So many things to try- I wanted to taste everything... but the already prepared serving sizes were too big in my opinion which meant so much wasted food. I don't understand that- people can get more if they like something. So I didn't like that.

The deserts are also beautifully displayed. Maybe not the biggest selection, but more unique choices than other buffets.

When I was a kid, we used to go to the Circus Circus buffets for like $5 a head.  But, since we were visiting the 'rents and we wanted to treat them to a buffet, we decided to splurge.  And at that price, it definitely was splurging!

Now that we got that price thing out of the way, I must say, this was probably the best buffet I've been to (and I've been to my share of LV buffets).  We were there from a Saturday to Monday, so we were able to go on a Sunday night when it wasn't as crowded as a Friday or Saturday night.  We probably got there around 6pm and the line wasn't long at all.  We were seated promptly and the ""festivities"" would start soon thereafter.  They have all your standard fares here.  But the quality is just far superior.  They have your stations of Chinese, Italian, Seafood, etc.  I had some crab legs, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, some lamb, and believe it or not, pizza.  I usually never fill up on pizza at a buffet, but I just had to.  Boy, it was good.  Thin-crust and chewy.

For anyone that even knows me just a little bit, my favorite part of the meal is dessert.  And I definitely wasn't disappointed here.  Again, all your normal buffet desserts are here.  The one thing that stood out at the Wynn buffet was the fresh ice-cream.  I tried vanilla and this coconut ice cream.  The coconut ice cream was awesome!  It seemed like it had chunks of macaroons or something.  It was awesome!

As for service, it was too better than average.  They refilled our glasses frequently, however one or twice they didn't take our plates fast enough.  Not a big problem though.

I've been to various buffets in Vegas, but what struck me the most about the Buffet at the Wynn was the fact that it was clean and neat. Then again, it was a Thursday night.

I was there during the Wynn's 5th anniversary, and so with 55 points on your Red card, you could get a free meal at the buffet. Sign me up! After some heavy playing on the slots, I got my 55 points and my ""free"" buffet.

It was my first time at the Wynn, so I spent some time wandering and looking at all the choices while everybody else made a beeline to the stations that they liked the most.  There is a seafood station on one side, with cocktail shrimp and crab legs. Most people were loading up on them. The seafood was good, and the cocktail sauce was a lot spicier than I'm used to. It definitely had a kick to it.  As you walk along the rest of the buffet, they had some international food stations, featuring Chinese (with lo mein, and dumplings), Indian (curry, lamb, etc), Italian (pasta station, osso bucco), the requisite carving station, and then some hot seafood items (various fish in different sauces). The other end of the buffet had a charcuterie, salad bar, and soup.  Towards the center of the buffet area was the dessert station, which was probably my favorite due to the all the pretty desserts in the little plastic containers, and the crepe and waffle station.

Overall, I thought the food was better than I had expected. Because it was a buffet, I didn't expect the food to be amazing (even though it was the Wynn), so I was definitely surprised by the fresh quality of the food. Nothing really tasted as if it had been sitting out under the heating lamps for hours on end. I was disappointed by the sushi selection, however, and consisted of two different rolls.  Overall, the food selection wasn't as varied as what you would find at some of the other buffets.  However, I think that's a good thing because one problem I have with buffets is that I always feel like I didn't get to try everything I wanted because there was just too much to choose from (I'm quite indecisive at times). Therefore, having a varied, but slightly more limited selection, allowed me to enjoy my meal fully without wondering if I ""missed something at that really far away station I couldn't get to"".  I also liked the crepe station because it's made right in front of you. However, when they make the (customized) crepe for you, they add a lot of filling to the crepe, so it loses its crispy texture.  Still good, however, but slightly overwhelming in size.  

The service here is superb as well.  Our server quickly removed our empty plates and dishes, and refilled our beverages promptly.  The atmosphere is nice as well; it wasn't really loud or noisy so we were able to enjoy our meal, as well as have a good conversation while we were enjoying our after-dinner coffee as well.

We arrived, paid, and informed the hostess that we were a party of 8. She told us we might not be able to sit together (what??). Then I noticed the hostess staple our receipts, 4 in one group, 4 in the other. Then we were shown to our tableS. Two tables, 10 feet apart for a party of 4. Uhh, that doesn't add up to me. The hostess didn't even attempt to seat us together.

After we politely complained we were told if we wanted to sit together we needed to pay an automatic 18% gratuity to sit in a room that would accommodate us. Wait, but there was a table of 8 right in the middle of the two tables they tried to seat us at. How could we not be accommodated with everyone else? 

After a few words with the manager the seating was finally settled. We all were seated together at one table. There never should have been a problem with seating a party of 8 in the first place.

California rolls - terrible.

Fish cakes - fishy and not that crispy

Well, you naysayers, yes you were right!  I admit the flaw in my decision 2 years ago to pass ""go"" and go all the way to the Bellagio, thereby passing up an uber-delicious food party known as the Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas.

My friend and I decided to go for the lunch buffet which opens at 11am, and is priced at $22.95.  I was very, very impressed by the service and the selection of food at this buffet.  It seemed like every culinary region in the world was represented at this buffet, and not to worry, every station has a placard stating the cuisine of that particular area.  My favorites included the chinese dumplings, spicy tuna sushi, the salad station, paht thai noodles, and the Mexican station.  And of course, no meal would be complete without dessert!  The dessert station had a wonderful variety of individual portions of cakes, pies, muffins, cupcakes, etc.  I believe even bread pudding was available as a choice.

I tried to sample a little bit of everything, and I left a very FULL and satisfied customer.  The one station that really impressed me the most, personally, was the made to order omelet station.  I contemplated an omelet but there were so many other choices, I think I'm going to try that on my next visit.

My husband went for the roast turkey but instead of carving the whole turkey they were displaying, they cut up cooked turkey breast meat (not the same as a roast turkey).  For the price, not worth it and will not go back.  The waitress we had was wonderful and we did tip her (at least she earned it).  Tried the creme brulee and it was runny.

1. Come starving. You're here to indulge your gluttony or fuel up for a night of drinking...not to indulge in a light snack. 
2. Get on the expensive stuff.  Gotta get your moneys worth. That means the Crab legs friends. Its good here. Trust me
3.  Ignore the creamy stuff. You can only put down so much, the creamy stuff will prevent you from getting those last 3 plates. 
4. When your friend starts slurring her words after two champagne glasses, time to start drinking those glasses for her. 
4. There's no shame in going back for 5th, 6th and 7th rounds.  It costs $40. Eat what you came for. Play your cards right and you won't have to eat for the rest of the day.
5. Expecting great sushi at a buffet is just silly. This place is no exception. 
6. Same goes for pizza. This isn't a dorm cafeteria...if you want pizza, go to a place that specializes in pizza
7. There are a billion choices, why stick with just one? Try something new. Don't overindulge in one thing...
8. ...unless its the delicious lamb or prime rib. Lose yourself.
9. When your friend starts drunkenly ranting at you, time to get up and go explore the buffet some more. 
10. Its a marathon..not a sprint. Take some time and enjoy the very pretty surroundings. 
11. There's ALWAYS room for dessert....especially when its as good as it is here.
12. When your friend passes out  on the table, thats a signal to get out of there.

+1 star for having crepes for dessert

My boyfriend and I wanted to come here to check out what all the rave was about. First off, we went on a weekday. It was like a Tuesday night, and they still had a long line; therefore, we were hoping it'd be a meal to remember! Boy, were we right! It WAS a meal that we'll never forget for ALL THE WRONG REASONS! It was $40 per person, which was like the most we've paid for a buffet on the strip... and we're such FOODIES! We got it and checked out what they had. There were no oysters. They only had snow crab and it was grilled... not steamed. They had so much space and not enough food selection. For instance, there was an Indian food counter and they had naan but there was no curry, no tikka masala to eat the naan with. They had Indian rice! WTF? They had prime rib, but it was so hard and chewy and it wasn't even warm at all! Yes, granted my expectations were a bit high, but seriously, Steve Wynn and do A LOT BETTER! They didn't have oysters, or sushi, or anything good, really. The service was crappy. Our waitress barely ever checked up on us or cleared our table. We had to stack up our plates pretty high for her to finally come over and take them. We had to keep flagging her down for refills of water and coke. She kinda gave us the feeling she was avoiding us or ignoring us. I HATE THAT... especially at a place that's supposedly HIGH CLASS?!? I dunno what other people are raving about. Seriously, this place had a wide selection of breads, not a variety of foods. I guess a lot of people are drawn to the pasta station? I guess the majority of people who go here and ""LOVE IT"" are either really drunk or completely starved from gambling that they can't differentiate from the lack of quality in the food as well as the selection. Honestly, the only thing I liked about the buffet at Wynn was their dessert. They had gelatos, candy apples, cupcakes, creme brulee, flan, fruits, and customized crepes.

In general this buffet is very grandiose; there are so many options it can get overwhelming but I usually try a bunch of things and then choose my favorites to go back to. The meat section with the Prime Rib is always very tasty, and salads are quite good too. I was really happy with the gyoza (potsticker) and chinese bun station this time around, and the seaweed salad and shrimp cocktail was yummy too. I never eat the pizza or the bread because that just fills you up and you have to save room for dessert!! The creme brulee is always good and the creme puffs were light and fluffy and filled with some amazing vanilla whipped cream. The carrot cake was just okay and the raspberry cake wasn't very good so I'd skip that. They also have a great ice cream bar as well =)

If you can eat and drink your $50 worth, I say go for it. This included the buffet and bottomless mimosas\/bloody marys\/ select wines\/ a draft beer.

The food was somewhat tasty, nothing greatly stands out, though. I really only had one plate of food, and nothing was so amazingly delicious I had to go back and get seconds! 

I wish I had tried the meats, because they had a great selection. 

Buffets are just... buffets. There is no way I ate and drank my worth, but if you can, this is your joint. The desserts looked incredible, but alas, I just didn't try enough.

Maybe they need to hire more than one hostess, they can certainly afford to when it is $50 per person here.",2,1,2

It really doesn't matter much, because frankly, a buffet at the Wynn, ""entirely reimagined with over 120 new dishes"", charging $54 (holiday pricing), anything less than 4 stars is not worth going to.

There are disappointments all over.  Let's start with the food.  Variety is good, but misses the mark on everything.  The items I had: 

lobster bisque (very salty)
cocktail shrimp (tiny!)
crab claws (bland)
silken tofu (bland)
sushi (good, sushi rice is actually was great)
nasi goreng (really just a bland fried rice with chinese sausage)
Frank Sinatra meatball (so heavy and dense, and tastes like sausage)
oyster rockefeller (texture was off, there's no crust on the top)
mussels (not good)
cold cuts (good)
tuna sashimi in coconut milk (not a good combination at all)
osso buco (not very tender)
street tacos (story to follow, but terrible)
prime rib (pretty good, but see below)
veal (the end cut was good, the middle piece was overcooked)
desserts (see below)

Look, I *REALLY* wanted to like this place.  I was looking forward to eating here because I was hoping this would be a real competitor to Caesars' buffet because competition drives companies to do better.  So it is no pleasure for me to give this place such a poor review.

Issues with this place.  Let's start with the staff.  ATTENTION BUFFET STAFF: If you are unhappy with your job, LEAVE.  There were so many frowning faces and pissed off looks behind the counter it's crazy.  Of note, the guy scooping out ice cream looked like we were bothering him (yes, a few people ahead of me took their time deciding which ice cream to get, but you're working at probably one of the happiest stations in the entire buffet).  The meat carver's eyebrows was furrowed the entire time, and would great you with a loud ""HUH?""  I asked the man for a piece of prime rib (for the record, I am typically extremely nice and polite, especially to food servers).  The attitude was so terrible, I was TOO AFRAID to ask for a piece of lamb.

My friend said that's just how he is, and he's probably not pissed or anything, his eyebrows are just that way.  Doesn't matter.  Management should've taken note and trained the staff to not greet people with ""HUH"".

On to the street tacos.  Clearly the lady working the grill was not properly trained.  On the sign it says you have three choices of meat: carne asada, turkey, and pork.  I asked the lady for carne asada and pork.  After repeating myself several times ""carne asada"" and her not understanding me, I finally had to say ""beef.""  ""OH, BEEF!""

The grill didn't have any pork, so she carved out a tiny bit of pork (just enough for me, not all the people behind me), and started to dry cook the pork on the flat top grill.  One of her coworkers walked by and noticed she didn't use any oil and he taught her she needs to put oil on the meat for it cook.

Oh! I almost forgot about the shabu-shabu station.  Shabu-shabu is japanese hot pot.  You take boiling broth, dip your meat and vegetables in it, and cook it like fondue.  This is not anything like it.  It's basically noodle soup.  Which is fine, I am always down for noodle soup.  The noodles are blanched in hot water, then the ingredients (noodles, raw sliced beef, vegetables, you can also ask for fish balls and some other items) are set in the bowl, then hot soup is poured on top.  The soup is supposed to be hot enough so by the time you get back to your table, the meat will be cooked but not so much that it's chewy.  At least that's how Vietnamese Pho is.

The problem is, the soup is not hot enough to cook the meat.  After letting the meat sit in the bottom of the bowl of soup for 5 minutes, it still came out barely rare at best.

Look, I've had Vietnamese Pho takeout where the soup is packed separately, drive home (15 minutes), unpack everything, pour the soup over the raw meat at home, and the soup was still hot enough to cook the meat.  This is simply not acceptable.

Back to the desserts.  At a nice buffet, eh, even at an average buffet, I will go back to the table with 6-8 items.  I literally went back to the table this time with just 1 cake, and 1 scoop of ice cream.  Ice cream = salted caramel, my favorite.  Oh wait, did I say salted caramel?  Because I'm pretty sure it was just chocolate.  No salt.  No caramel.  Just chocolate.

The other dessert items are just uninspired or look boring.  Come on, lemon curd tarts? carrot cakes? We need to step this up here. They do have a made-to-order crepe station but I'm not a fan of crepes so I didn't try that.  

I was bored with my dessert selection (it was some sort of raspberry chocolate tart thing), I went back to try some other ice cream flavors.  Vanilla and chocolate malt (oops, I meant plain vanilla), and strawberry cheesecake (meh).

Not a fan of this place.  I'm tempted to chalk this up to they're still working the bugs out of the system.  But I am in no hurry to spend my money here again soon.",2,3,0

One reason is that, in order to get here, you need to walk through Wynn Las Vegas. This casino is truly A-class. You definitely feel like you're in a much swankier environment than, say, at the Paris' buffet (though the food quality there is also good).

Another reason is that they offer a wide selection of appetizers, entrees and dessert choices. Something for everyone, I suppose.

Lastly, a reason why I like this place is that their serving stations are generally small. That means they don't usually have food out for too long. Since the serving trays are smaller, that means (in my mind) that food is fresher, and better.

One down side here is that it's $40pp, which is pretty steep for a meal. That said, I believe that's the same price as Rio's buffet , but much more worth it in terms of taste.",1,0,0

Ok so there's also a high end shipping center but really, I think the Rolex\/Ferarri combo says it all.

Ok so wouldn't you expect a hotel at this caliber to have an exceptional buffet?  Yeah I did as well.  However, I was grossly dissappointed.

I want to talk about the best experience of my life at a buffet-- the Wynn Buffet. Once upon a brunch time, my friends and I went to the Wynn to get some buffet food. Part of the group got there earlier so they waited in line... some of us came later and cut some people (to JOIN OUR PARTY). A lady who's a couple of parties behind us started bitching at us because we were cutting, but really... REALLY our party is not that huge and we already had the majority of the group waiting in line. So I explained our situation calmly but kinda mean cuz I did it all with a smile and that pissed her off. 
Woman: ""You all are rude bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh. I'm going to report you to the authorities"" (I said something in between...) Woman:""If you're going to stay here, then do it , but I don't like it bleh bleh bleh bleh (something along those lines)"" Me: ""Yes, sorry, but we are going to stay here."" she went ape shit and stormed off. To report us, i'm assuming. First she went to the cashier ladies... I'm glad those ladies are rude because they just ignored that woman. Next thing I see is that woman running towards the casino. to report us to the security guards probably. UH. And of course, casinos love money more. More customers at Buffet= more money. Our group # (greater than) Woman. She never came back.

Every time I go to vegas I always like to try different buffets and had my share of the 24 hour buffet of  buffet pass. Well after eating at the wynn I will explore no more! Normally my friends & I hit this buffet right when we get to vegas (coming from OC, California). We usually get to vegas around 2 so we get to eat both brunch & like most reviewers, we stay til their dinner items come out (double dip yeah so what I'm asian). They definitely have quantity AND quality!

Meats (brunch):
Prime Rib - pretty good, not too salty and they even grill it for you if it's too red for your liking.
Honey Glazed Bacon - It looked like a giant slice of ham, but I guess it's bacon? Whatever it is, it is bomb dot com! This was probably one of the best meats they have at the carving station and it is DELICIOUS! Especially the crispy edge
Citrus Glazed Side of Salmon - Tasted like any other salmon, but the Terriyaki Grilled Mako fish right next to it was sooooo good! I ate like 2 servings of it.

I also love creating my own omelet here. Idk why, but the omelet they make here is really good compared to the hundreds of omelets I've eaten over the years at other buffets\/restaurants. I always make it out of egg white and add ham, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc.

They also have a really good asian section that has dim sum with the bbq pork buns, etc but I didn't wanna waste my stomach space on it although I did try the leek and it was awesome! worth trying it if you've never tried before. They also have congee which was pretty cool. I shared some with my bf and i LOVE that they have that asian shredded pork that you put in the congee and of course the asian donut bread thing. There were also noodles, asian stir fry, etc.

 They also had all the other typical brunch things: waffles, french toast, eggs benedict, etc. I didn't waste stomach space on this either cause hello I'm trynna save room for their yummy dinner foods!

Meats (dinner):
Oven Roasted Turkey - LOVE it. they have a separate bowl for dark meat and the carver cuts white meat for you. The cranberry sauce they make fresh themselves w\/ cranberry and it is sooo good!
They offer Prim Rib & The Salmon also for dinner, but no yummy honey glazed bacon
Kobe Meatloaf - Don't even try it, definitely didn't taste like kobe beef
Cajun Roasted Pork Loin - YUM I think i grabbed 2 of these. They weren't overly salty or chewy
Braised Veal Short Ribs - Worth trying, but wasn't that great for me to grab seconds


They take out the omelet section and ta da you get to create your own pasta!! But I didn't wanna load up on carbs so I skipped this, but my friends said it was good. Next to it is their bomb ass brick pizza station. LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizzas!! Make sure you try the basil one! Their crusts are thin and perfectly crispy. My bf always gets like 3 slices.

Alaskon Opilio Crab Legs - HOLY SHIZZZZ if you're a fan of crab legs and you're that person that gets plates & plates of it then you definitely needa get your butt to this buffet. Within the first like 10 mins they put out the crab legs, it was gone! The crab legs are really fresh here you can taste it in the fibers and it's really sweet not like those other flavorless crab legs at other buffets (aria I'm talkin about you). I pair these up w\/ the shrimp cocktail and damn I'm in heaven

For dinner they take out the congee section and they serve TOM YUM SOUP!!!! This buffet sure knows what asians like and it tastes pretty authentic. The tom yum soup was just as good as any other thai restaurant and the spice level was perfect

I can go on & on about their other foods, but it's pretty extensive so I'm just gonna skip onto the desserts!

They have a pretty big bakery section and they look all cute, but I just dove right in for the gelato & make your own crepe section. The gelato here is really good and not overly sweet. The texture is sort of more ice cream like too. I added these on top of the crepes and it was so yummy.

Carving station is minimal, serving two items, but the Teriyaki marinated flank steak was done perfectly.

We went here for my mom's birthday and the food was lackluster.  For the amount that you pay for a buffet, the Indian Casinos in California have better quality than the food in Vegas.
I mean this place is in the Wynn and I sure didn't feel like I won anything, It seemed more like a Loss.
The steak was dry and rubbery, the gespacho was served in small containers (which was a great idea because it was disgusting).  The handroll ...you should steer clear of because it tastes nothing like Japanese.  The seafood was far from impressive too.  Just a poor all around buffet with subpar service.
I'm pretty sure that when it comes to food service, they take a course in food microbiology.  When clearing out dishes please don't just take the dishes and plop the utensils on the table.
For one, ask the person if it's ok to take the dishes.
Secondly, when you put the utensils on the table, the table isn't 100% clean...do you expect me to put it back in my mouth?  
There is a reason I put my utensils on an unused dish...I would like to avoid food born illness.
Please just ask customers if it's ok to take away the dishes, otherwise I will ask you for more utensils and you'll be annoyed that I bothered you for extra silverware when we could have avoided this by you just simply asking.

King Crab was colossal, juicy, and easy to manage.  
The flank steak was prepared fresh with the juices still packed inside oozing out into my mouth at first bite.  
Rack of lamb was tender with vibrant color.  
Shrimp was so plump and pre-peeled for you.  It had that popping sensation in your mouth.

Couldn't complain about the line either.  I've seen worse at the Bellagio.  

My advice would be to be aware of: 
A.) how crowded Vegas is as a whole during your stay 
B.) how large your group is as it might be faster to sit separately

They had all kinds of food that you can imagine. Everything was fresh and so tasty. This is the kind of food that you would expect from an upscale restaurant.

We had some old folks with us so we couldn't wait that long. The buffet had an option where if you paid $20\/per person you could get a front of the line pass so that is what we did.

Favorites: 
Veal short ribs: I wish I ate more of these. It just..fell off the bone and melted in my mouth...Paired with their creamy mash potatoes...It was beautiful.

Prime Rib: Chewy compared to the veal, but still really yummy.
Dessert! Everything! There is a gelato bar! It was lovely.
Pizza: Although it isn't really smart to load up on carbs in a buffet with these, I really liked the pizza with melted mozzarella, basil, and tomato was REALLY good. 

I would stay away from their Asian foods...The sushi was just..abysmal. Didn't really bother with the dim sum. Their Kobe Meatloaf was a really weird in texture and the meatballs were odd.

I was really excited to come here because some people had told me that this buffet was better than the Wicked Spoon, which is my current favorite, but the Wicked Spoon is still my personal fav.  

With that being said, however, everything I had here was good.  It's a bit pricy, at $40 a plate for dinner, but I feel like I got my money's worth.  Had a couple servings of medium rare prime rib, some pasta (their papardelle pasta was really good, especially with some meatballs thrown in), and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember off of the top of my head.  

Overall, the food quality here was pretty darn good for a buffet, but I guess I was just expecting more after all of the hype.

Because of timing issues, I had to come in clubbing attire, which was SUPER awkward, and there were some creepy employees working behind the counters, so fyi - don't come here decked out in clubwear!  But that's probably common sense for most folk...",4,2,2

Quality, variety, and best of all: QUANTITY. Prime rib, Kobe steak, Alaskan crab, mushroom ravioli - its almost too much. Even the ice cream is legit; they have a counter with a worker dedicated to scooping the stuff all day.

There's hardly any meat.  There's prime rib and bacon (fancy, I guess) for the carving table.  There was some seafood laying around.  Tiny bits of chicken.  The ""Asian"" section had lotus leaf sweet rice, super dry white rice, congee and chau sau bau (sp?  pork buns).  Very lacking.  Overall, the problem is that there is a lot of fancy bits but it is prepared pretty poorly.  Lots of dry food with poor taste.  As for the sushi bar... please all you would be sushi chefs and buffet managers... IT'S THE FRICKIN' RICE!!!  IT MUST BE PREPARED PROPERLY AND NOT MUSHY AND EXCEEDINGLY VINEGARY.  Bad rice will completely counteract even the best and freshiest fish in the world.  I can't stress how important the preparation of sushi rice is!  Are you listening Clubhouse of Costa Mesa?  

The dessert station reportedly had only four desserts.  I was too busy choking after a taste of the super dry rice that got caught in my gullet to check it out.

On top of that, it was $33 for a Sunday brunch (no champagne, it is a few bucks extra) and the wait was reportedly an hour and a half (at 10:30am on a Sunday morning).  If I wasn't partially comped and given a line pass to bypass this horrific wait, I probably would have been pretty pissed off.  Even still, paying 33 for three still made me feel ripped off.  It sucked that bad.

I actually think some of the ""lesser"" buffets are much better, such as Harrahs, Bally's etc.

It is too bad since the place is looks nice and the Wynn is a pretty classy joint.  I don't know what happened, but the first year the Wynn was in operation, the buffet was through the roof.  For some reason, it has gone down hill steadily and has now fallen off a cliff.",2,0,0

I'm so happy my little group woke up early for this. We went for Sunday brunch and got to the restaurant just past 9:30. There were two people ahead of us in line. It was such a relief, because random restaurants at Treasure Island (where we were staying) had lines forming already.  

Brunch was ~$28 per person (coffee, juice, tea included), ~$35 per person if you wanted alcohol (Bloody Mary's, Champagne, Mimosas). 

This place was so pretty. Such a fun time to be had designing your own plate. Oval plates seem so much chicer than round ones, don't you think?

Food. Is. Superb. I don't think anyone would go hungry here, even you picky eaters out there. Two rows of pastries and desserts (madeleines, croissants, chocolate croissants, sorbets, bread pudding and crme anglaise, cookies, and mini servings of chocolate cake) for the sweet tooths. For the meat eaters, there's a carving station with prime rib and--wait for it!--glazed slab of bacon. Eggs and eggs benedict and lox and fried chicken are all yours. They have a cooked-to-order omelet chef. There are waffles to be eaten with various preserves and fruits. There are silver dollar pancakes with warm maple syrup.

Interesting stations: (1) Congee bar, complete with thousand year old eggs, Chinese fried long donuts (yo tiao in Mandarin); (2) Gazpacho bar, with mix-ins like cucumbers, onions, diced tomatoes; (3) Strawberry bar, with fresh hulled strawberries, julienned mint, cream.

My favorites were small servings of yogurt (sweetened with honey, topped with crunchy granola and a whole strawberry) and cups of segmented grapefruit (tossed with a coarse sugar to enhance sweetness and lend texture, topped with a small sprinkle of mint). 

Good table side service made sure that the drinks were always topped-off and plates were always whisked away when we returned with a new plate. 

Highly recommended.

So, I never go to them. However, I heard that The Wynn has vegan offerings at EVERY restaurant on their property, so I figured I should take advantage of going to a buffet for once.

Initially, I was pretty disappointed by the vegan offerings. I was there at brunch, and I found only 4 things labeled as being vegan (enchiladas, veggie sushi, a muffin, tapioca pudding). So, we asked for some guidance..... And since the Wynn gives excellent service, a chef came out and gave me a complete tour of the buffet.

So, this is what I learned, which I hope will help vegans. You can get almost ANYTHING made vegan at this buffet, but you have to ask for it! For example, he told me that they have a gluten-free pancake mix they use that is also vegan, you just tell the guy to make it with almond milk. At the omelette station, they will make you a tofu scramble. They will make you a special pizza with vegan cheese. They have vegan salad dressing on request. The breakfast potatoes, which are on display covered in filthy little fish, can also be served without the fish. They have vegan butter for the bagels, if you ask for it. Also, the Spanish rice has no chicken brith in it, the tortilla chips aren't made with lard, etc etc etc.

So...... The bottom line is, if you don't mind going around and making special requests, you can eat pretty well as a vegan here! But you wouldn't know this if you don't get the special tour from the chef like I did, so I took a star off, because they should more specifically mention that there are vegan options available. Because you wouldn't know it just by going through the buffet, and I bet there have been many sad vegans at this buffet who expected more!",15,4,5

I would much rather come here and pay the Bellagio price for the Wynn buffet as I think it accurately represents what you are receiving.,1,0,1

We were invited by the Casino host Mr. Brando as we were about to cash out our chips.   We went for their infamous Champagne Brunch.  That Sunday was crowded but we didn't mind because the host said go straight to the VIP\/Invited guest line, and tell them I sent you there and if theres a problem call my desk.  

As soon as we got to the front of the line, the rude cashier said to us go back to the end of the line bc you don't have a fast pass??  And before I could say anything she yelled out ""NEXT!!!""
I
 said to her,  ""wait... call the casino host they've invited us.  Here's our players club please look it up for our complimentary meal.""  

When we sat down, wasn't until 2 trips to the buffet line when our waitress finally came out and asked, ""what would you like to drink???"" 

We've both responded ""Champagne brunch please...""  

She replied ""You have to pay extra for that!""  

Again, I had to explain to her the Casino's host invited us if you have any problem just call the desk.  She didn't bother either instead just offer us water.  

I must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.  However, we're at the Wynn and not Circus Circus.  Obviously we didn't have problem paying $50\/person meal when we were playing $500-$1000 hand probably the only reason why we were invited for complimentary meal.  Regardless, we've been to plenty of fine establishments and we've never been treated the way we did.  You would think at a 5-star resort place like this would have a superb customer service.  I guess I was too distracted by the pretty decor.

**UPDATE:  Mr. Brando have been addressed with these issues and he's doing everything in his power to make-up for our bad experience.  He handled the issue very professional and we would definitely come back because of him.",2,0,0

loved the salad and soup (who eats salad and soup at a buffet?????? i do!), loved the tomato pasta thing... yummy chinese noodles (they make the soup noodle for you on the spot), loved the funky square garlic bread... loveeed the dessert section. can i please have a table at the dessert section? different ice cream choices and they have a person making crepes on request. i was too full at the time so i just had ice cream...

came here for a party buffet gathering. 

i walked around the place. got a prime rib with some gravy. the prime rib was horribly cut by the chef and it was hard as a rock... the steak knife couldn't even cut through the cook meat. The cutting wasn't well done either, so really don't understand why its so hard. this shows how bad the quality meat they use. i let the waitor take away that whole cut after i tried one piece. HORRIBLE 
The chicken also sucks. it taste like shredded cardboard box.

We decided to go here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, and chose this casino because it was one of the newest on the strip.  The price was somewhat steep, around $30.  The decor was quite impressive when you first enter, it reminded you as though you're about to have tea in England.  We had a very large party so we were forced to separate into two groups.  

From Italian to Asian to American, they had an okay variety of food, but only had a couple of dishes to choose from.  I just wish that they replenished more frequently, I had to make several trips back to see if they replenished a dish.  Waiting for food was bearable, compared to other buffets where you just want to scream at the person in front of you to hurry and make a selection.  The quality was pretty good, I'll say that much compared to other buffets.  I was quickly stuffed after my first plate, and I forced myself to taste a little of the plethora of dessert choices, it had it's own room!  If anything, I wish I had room for the dessert, it all looked so good.

Service was okay, maybe because our waiter was a little busy, it was hard to find him right away.

So be sure to request the atrium. The collonade of plants and veggies are stunning.  

The food is also very very good.  Not the best brunch buffet I've ever had but very good.  One of the pricier buffets on the Strip but that was expected from the Wynn.

What loses a star is the bad service.  Now when we were first seated in the main restaurant, right off the hallway, I knew enough to say ""no , this will not do"".  We had waited in line for 45 minutes and I wasn't going to sit in a standard hotel restaurant while pple walked down the hallway staring at me.  Our waitress promptly moved us to the atrium area to a lovely four top.  She was then publicly scolded by the looming restaurant manager for taking our drink order.  We tried giving her a tip but she was obviously frantic at that point and handed it to the other waiter.  Ridiculous.  She was the best server we had.

What I soon realized, the main problem with this place is is that they simply did not have enough pple clearing tables.  While the line snaked around in the waiting area, abandoned tables sat with dishes piled high up to ten minutes after the diners had left.  I couldn't believe how poorly managed that aspect of this restaurant was.

Now if you can over look all that, the food is really quite good.  And it has a large selection.  I just am a little unsure if the 45 minute wait and $40 price tag were worth it.",1,0,0

The fruit salad was better than other places, but we had a hard time finding good fruit in Vegas.

Salad offerings were OK, nothing to write home about.  Cheeses - there were 3 choices, Swiss, Cheddar, and smoked Gouda, all very tired and sweaty looking.  Some lunch meats, meh.  Hot foods - tough tri-tip, very heavily breaded fried chicken, some sausages.  Other than mashed, no potato offerings.  Desserts were definitely meh.

That said the service was extremely great. In fact the lady checking patrons in invited me to do a loop before paying just so that I could discover the type of food they were serving for myself. Such kindness could not be ignored - therefore I confidently entered and started filling up my plate.

At the same time I realized that perhaps different days at the Wynn may have won buffet aficionados, but on other days were more or less struggling to win my 5FF feat for my mom's birthday dinner.

Not conforming to a pre-buffet line that could be 10 anacondas long, my parents & I arrived at about 5pm.  Regardless of special occasion, to get my moola's worth for the $39.99 gourmet dinner (applies to Fri & Sat) for foods from 16 different stations, the 1st instinct that came to mind was to check on my Yelp app to see what my Yelp buddies loved or loathed.  However, I guess you can blame my poorly signaled smartphone during our Friday dinner.  W\/o my friends' POVs from it I had to completely alternate--rather than intertwine--with my old buffet strategy by primarily choosing the edibles that typically cost close to arm-and-leg at traditional sit downs.

As a result, out of 3 plates, 1 dessert platter, and 2 mini dessert shots, here's my breakdown ordered from ickiest to most glorious, with asterisks indicating Gourmet Dinner specialties explicitly listed right before the buffet entrance...

Zero to 1.0 star honestly going to...
-Unagi Sushi* (itsy bitsy eel & rice went down to Flavorlessville)
-Kimchi (soggy, weird-tasting that if you feed this to kimchi virgins, they'll get traumatized)
-Baba Ghanoush (the olive green eggplant dollop on the meat-ful plate; it's way over-pureed & shockingly bland)
-A mini cupcake that may be confused w\/ RVC or Chocolate (Idk, my tongue couldn't tell o_o)
-Chocolate Chip Cookie (chocolate flavor was weakly detected)

1.5 to 2.0 stars are for...
-Seared Red Snapper* (had the snapper flavor but too fishy aftertaste even for the fish devotee in me)
-The hard Cheeses for the Charcuterie* (barely any spark)
-Apple Cobbler (too syrupy)

2.5 to 3.0 stars on...
-Hummus (like the eggplant counterpart it's too mushy wushy)
-Clam Chowder (tasty, but saltier than expected, & soup had a pretty thin consistency that allowed the clam meat to sink easily towards the bottom of the bowl)
-Pork Potsticker*
-Rosemary Lamb T-Bone* (right gamey-ness, but well-done dry UNLESS you're lucky to be in front of the station guy who was about to throw in the immediately fresh & juicy morsels, hence giving it a 2nd chance on my 2nd plate)
-Moroccan Spiced Lamb T-Bone* (a 'lil bit better overall with possibly the same elapsed sit down as Rosemary)
-Alaskan Opilio Crab Legs* (I was quite a sucker for its O name, but despite my props on how they're vertically sliced for easy picking, the tasty meats unfortunately also had a 'lil too much of NaCl)
-Tortellini Carbonara* (pretty delicious, thick & saucy ring-like pasta)
-Chilled Shrimp Cocktail*
-Chocolate Mousse
-Prime Rib* (okay, again I give nutty props on how it's flawlessly cooked & utmost juicy for something RARE =D, but I also remembered the prime rib at both Bellagio & Studio B being overall more cow-on flavorful than Wynn's ^_^)

Now, 3.5 to 4.0 towards...
-Triangular slice of Pita
-Brick Oven Veggie Pizza* (I was pleasantly surprised)
-Scottish Smoked Salmon*
-White Anchovy & Roasted Pepper Salad* (interesting)
-Dark-colored Proscuitto*
-Citrus Brine Roasted Turkey* (Mmm, juicy)
-Veal Short Rib* (should have known to save room over the lambs -_-)
-Summer Salad w\/ Toasted Walnuts
-Overall service (the guy at the cutting station happily made sure I got my prime rib pink-red, & our pleasant server offered me a canister amount of decaf coffee as my included drink)

A 4.5 to...
-Butternut Squash (the astute name says it all :D)
-Beet Salad
-Passionfruit Tapioca Shot

And a Big, High 5, Up Top to...
-Must I say it...ohh fine... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?userid=jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw#HGFC_hrtzGaWov97zRhS2Q
Blueberry Lemon Parfait (consistency for parfait was perfect, offered well-balanced tartness for the tart lover, & was absolutely ambrosial, hence avariciously gobbling 2 extra shots after the dessert platter)

Though I'm neither an advocate nor an opponent for this Vegas dinner buffet, the 'rents--yes, the b-day lady included--had the similar look of Maroney's reaction to her silver medal, with an exception of my dad's 2nd helping of the prime rib.  Nonetheless, if you need to hit this up on your Sin City must-go's, hopefully you can pull up the reviews & tips via Yelp app AND memorize\/save the text messages on what your Yelp\/non-Yelp friends enjoyed most to win your passionate, buffet hunger--and to please the celebrant's meal *^_^.",57,50,53

On Saturday we chose to hit up the champagne brunch at the hotel. WOW! It was great! Awesome selection and variety! They had everything from fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, eggs benedict, fresh ""create your own"" omelets, prime rib, hand carved roasted bacon, enchiladas, seafood and ceviches, dim sum and a tantalizing dessert bar! 

From the outside it doesn't look all the big inside but it's really huge and have these fun topiary like chandeliers hanging in the center of the restaurant. I especially liked that we got to bypass the HUGE line of people because we were hotel guests! 

Here's what I tried:
Mini belgian waffles- YUM! YUM! They're about 2"" x 2"" and you have a choice of warm maple syrup, strawberry or blueberry compote. I had a couple with the blueberry compote....soooo scrumptious! 
Fresh fruit- very sweet!
Eggs benedict w\/ tazzo ham- yummy but it didn't stay warm and luke warm eggs and hollandaise is not so appetizing.
Salmon w\/ capers- Delish! 
BBQ Pork bao- not the best I've had but not too bad either. 
Breakfast pizza- a bit unusual but good nonetheless. They all were on a crispy thin crust, with eggs and cheese and either veggies, sausage or plain. Gives an all new meaning to having pizza for breakfast!

I gotta say that I'm glad I save this for the last day... the food here is amazing, and the selection is endless... if i went here on the first night, i would have been complaining \/ bitching about how other buffets suck and all that...

it might be $40, but it's totally worth the value... the king crab legs for instance, have no more shells, it's all removed for you... the same for the cocktail shrimps... but what really caught my attention is the make your own pasta section, the chef there was super nice and extremely friendly, it beats TI's bar by a mile (and that's being generous)...

i also like their salmon and their huge variety of desserts... almost wanna spend another night just to have the buffet again",0,1,1

I stuck with more of the breakfast food, so I had eggs, bacon, pancakes and waffles and some of the cheeses, which were delicious. 

My Bf has prime rib, which was amazing and some of the different vegetables. I wanted to go back for more food but I had filled my plate. The eggs were so light and fluffy they melted in my mouth. I also had a mimosa and that was delicious. I gave it 5 stars because the selection was out of this world and the food was perfect. I wish I could go back right now. :)",0,1,0

I would have giving it a 4 the first time I came to Vegas, but now coming back for the 2nd time and having this buffet again, I give it s 5!

People:
Trip 1) 20 
Trip[ 2) 2

Price: TOO MUCH well depending on the time you go, but worth it.
Breakfast for 2: ~$45
Brunch\/Lunch for 2: ~65-80 (all depends on the time, closer to 11am= cheaper, more towards 3pm= expensive)
Dinner: ~$40+ per person

Setting: Prepare for a LONG and I mean LONG wait like 30min -1hour 15min, but not less than 30 for sure. When I went the first time the line was out the door and into the hallway (considering this was New years, plan your trip wisely). There are about 3 sections where there are seatings. There are many categories of food, I am not going to lie, but of course there were plenty of food that I didn't care for, but there was enough selection to fill me up!

The quality of food here is amazing. Honestly, you may find better dessert somewhere else, but the food is the best!

Excellent service. The waiters would take your plates right away! However, if you want a refill on your drink, may take a little longer, yet its busy so you got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

All strategizing went out the window as I ran around like a fat kid in a candy store.  Seeing so many selections was sensory overload, and I became nearly dizzy with piggish happiness.

Four kinds of ceviche, gourmet salads served in elegant glasses, chicken panang prepared as you like it, a bountiful heaping of preserved meats and cheeses, a generous selection of Indian cuisine, lamb prepared three of four different ways, rare prime rib and juicy plump sausage and tender veal, steamed Chinese pork buns and crispy wontons (no thanks), mounds of crab legs and a variety of smoked fish, pasta made to order (also no thanks)...and those were just the entrees.

Not everything was good (the scallop ceviche was a bit slimy, the red snapper a bit tough), but overall I was impressed.  I must have made four or five trips and gained five pounds that night.  But that's how I like to live--without regrets.",0,0,0

$41.99 for dinner on a Saturday night. Because we had more than 6 people, 18% gratuity was automatically added which came out to about 50$. There was almost no line, and we were seated within a short time.

Pasta- beef lasagna was okay, my favorite was the three cheese ravioli with mushrooms. but then again, cheese and mushrooms are my favorite things. 

Cajun clams, corn, sausage, etc.- sauce wasn't that flavorful, it was mild and light.

Mussels- it was okay.

Dim Sum- Siu Mai was the best of the worst, dumplings sucked, etc.

Steamed Buns (the station where they make it for you)- pretty decent, not bad for a knock off peking duck bun.

Quesadillas- it was meh.

Carne Asada Taco- not bad, it tasted like exactly how it was supposed to taste. It was nice that the corn tortilla was warmed up.

Pastrami- good selection of hams and cheeses along with bread.

Lamb Chops, Prime Rib, Tomahawk Cut (Ribeye)- they were all meh. The best was the prime rib- so get that!

Crab Legs- frozen, typical. add drawn butter and lemon for best taste.

Shrimps- meh.

Guac and chips- not bad.

Poke- sucked, the flavor was too strong and you don't even taste the poke.. this was my first time having crappy poke. Now I know what that's like... they gave literally... two pieces. what.

Sushi Rolls- meh. 

Dessert- pretty decent. Ice cream comes in a small cone and with choice of topping, the creme br√ªl√©e was good (but how do you mess that up), everything else was okay.

I'm sure theres more food but its hard to review a buffet where everything tastes ok and because its a buffet you can't really expect much. I was surprised this place had so many reviews but I'm glad I got to try this place.",9,2,2

We went on the 26th after Christmas for an early dinner to avoid the crowd.  The line was about one hour (3:30pm until 4:30 when we were seated).  $200 for four adults.

By appearances it could be nice with 15 or so stations with a lot of variety.  Unfortunately no coffee station for the price!  

Salad:  not appetizing or original at all.  Skip.

Italian: the lobster ravioli was okay, polenta not good, gnocchi no good.  

The grill:  prime rib okay, lamb chops adequate (a fresh roast came out and that was good, the first one was tough and dry).

Chilled seafood:  probably the only thing that was worth it.  Oysters, crab legs and shrimp cocktail.  Difficult to mess up.  

Sushi bar:  sadly inedible.   The rice was the wrong texture and fish not fresh.  Ahi tuna poke was not sashimi grade fish -- this would not have been served in a good restaurant anywhere.  The grilled calamari with lime dressing was okay.

Desserts:  not bad but it was disappointing without a coffee bar.  Some highlights here:  a profiterole, creme br√ªl√©e, various small cakes.  Avoid the bread pudding.

All in all, this would have been good for $20 with no wait.  For $50 save your money and just go to a good sit down restaurant.

A girl's gotta draw the line somewhere if a girl wants to fit into her clothes.

The savory portion of my meal was as impressive as the sweet treats. I tried three types of fish (salmon, red snapper & seabass), which were *the best* buffet fish I've ever tried. Not dry nor were they drenched in sauce; each bite was a gift to my tastebuds from the Flavor Fairy. Green beans, mashed potatoes, cheese stuffed pasta, even the french onion soup--none of these items were run-of-the-mill buffet items. The Wynn's got something so many buffets are missing: attention to detail & quality ingredients. 

The bf & the rest of the guys loaded up on protein: lamb chops, pork chops, prime rib, jerk chicken, chicken picatta, & the above mentioned split crab legs dipped in clarified buttah. So many cuisines were represented.

There is plenty of variety but not everything is good, like the taco bar for example. The tacos were terrible. I felt kind of bad for some folks that were raving about the tacos here, but then again maybe I'm used to pretty incredible tacos living in San Diego that anything less just comes across as bad. Either way, I tried two different tacos and I just couldn't finish them. There are plenty of desserts, including a gelato bar.

The breakfast we had, was good...but to be honest, a little more expensive then what I would have expected to pay. Ate at Paris the day before and their buffet was enormous! This was not even 1\/2 the size of that!

What about the quality of the food? 
Was good. But nothing to write home about. Although, they did have an excellent tomato and mozzarella gazpacho, the smoked trout was delicious and the tomatoes were amazing...liked my husband promised...although, they were out of them quick!

The remainder of food on the breakfast menu, was normal fare, and average tasting. Waffles, omelet station, quince, bacon, sausage and a few other offerings tossed in here and there.

They were busy, so the waitstaff was a bit slow. Although, their coffee was pretty good and the juice was fresh.

Decided I was going to ask one of the workers behind the food station about what they put on the tomatoes the next time I went up, and did. The lady got super snotty with me - why?! Because they moved the tomatoes and she was talking to someone else. Luckily one of the other servers seen how she treated my question and apologized, telling me what type of tomatoes and what was on them.

The sushi was the low point and was poor even by buffet standards. It fell apart on the plate and the rice did not have a sticky quality.
The low review is a result of the lack of customer care. We were a party of seven and paid separately due to expense account issues. Asking, pleading, cajoling and finally bitching could not convince the staff to seat us at a single table. We were treated indifferently and we seated at two separate tables.

I must say this is one of the nicest looking buffets in Vegas and it has a very upscale atmosphere that you would expect at the Wynn. The huge dessert selection is amazing including favorites of mine such as Gelato and Creme Brulet. They had lots of variety in meats when I went such as Tomahawk Steak (Heck Yeah!), Crab Legs, Lamb, Quail, Smoked Salmon, etc. Also noteworthy, they had a Taco Station (I'd say pass unless your craving Tacos), and they have a Ramen station (didn't try got to full lol). They also have a lot of the usual stuff you expect to see at Buffets.

The service here was top notch and very attentive. Empty dishes were promptly removed and I never ran out of drink. Everyone was very friendly.

dont get me wrong, the food is decent. some of the it was even GOOD. but a lot of it wasnt that great. 

need an example? im a carnivore (rarr) and for me buffet is all about tucking away as many rare pieces of prime rib as i can. can you imagine my excitement as i got the rare ruby piece of prime rib? i was expecting tender, succulent, melt in your mouth beefiness. instead i just got a chewy tough piece of meat. it was like rib eye... from dennys. blech. 

so, while not everything was horrible, not everything was great. but, hey, what do you expect from a buffet? just cause it costs more doesnt mean its the best! if youve never had the wynn buffet before, id steer you elsewhere. try bellagio, or m resort.

Yes, the buffet is pretty special - there's so much to choose from.  Presentation gets high marks, but quality - which is so much more important - negates those high marks.

I recommend the Bacchanal Buffet at Ceasar's Palace. This buffet is the new undisputed king in town. The Ingredients are of high quality and everything tastes really good. Bacchanal, just like the Wynn Buffet, is also very clean.

Bellagio: souplantation-ish salad bar. 
Wynn: gourmet salad bar, including make your own and pre-maid salads in adorable, chic cups. 

Bellagio: overdone fruit station with out of season, flavorless fruits
Wynn: gourmet fruit and cheese bar, gourmet cold cut bar (salamis, proscuittos, cheeses, figs, apricots, etc)

Bellagio: rare\/bloody unseasoned prime rib
Wynn: herb crusted prime rib, cooked to perfection, with the delicious taste of fresh herbs and garlic still lingering

Bellagio: BBQ beef brisket swimming in salty A1 sauce
Wynn: Rib of Veal, so tender it's practically falling off the bone.

Bellagio: snow crab
Wynn: king crab

Bellagio: soft serve
Wynn: crepes made to order and a gelato bar. A whole separate room for dessert. 

Overall, this buffet is classy, clean, gorgeous. The foods are laid out around the permiter so you don't feel like a cow going from station to station, you can simply gracefully wander around the room (and everything is clearly labeled to catch your attention).  

Service is excellent. If you ask for coffee, you will get a carafe of it; if you ask for juice, you'll get a pitcher of fresh squeezed oj. 

Noise level is low for a buffet. Prices high, but you're getting quality food. Their ethnic selection is fabulous (the best sweet & sour shrimp and tandoori mahi mahi I've ever had).

Although it was rated as one of the best buffets in Vegas, it turned out to be worse worse than average.  Note: we went here for lunch, not for dinner.  Maybe they serve better food after 4pm?

Why such scathing review?  Let's see:

They promised sushi and ceviche.  From sushi, there were only salmon and cucumber rolls--with 5 times more rice than salmon.  I disassembled the rolls, extracted the small piece salmon inside, and realised that it tasted like it was cured to allow it to last longer.  Only one of the ceviches actually had seafood (the other was mushroom seviche).  I tried the scallops that I was able to fish out--they tasted like pure vinegar.

Pretty much all the fish they had was overcooked: baked salmon, fried tilapia; smoked salmon tasted icky.  Only the sea bass was worth coming back for.  There was also a delicious polish sausage.  Anything else?  Not really: rubbery meat; average salads; cold saut√©ed bok choy (it's only good while it's still hot).  The only redeeming factor of this buffet was the strawberry cheesecake, that was absolutely amazing.  I think I had 4 shotglasses.  (They serve dessert in shotglasses.)

You could eat 100 dollars worth of cheese off that salad bar and prociutto as well. Seafood I assume is flown in because it is always fresh. Dessert is mindblowing and the decor is like being in Willy Wonkas Chocolate factory. If you are a foodie, you will want to live there. No negatives that I can think of.

By far, one of my favorite buffets in Vegas~

Since me and my girlfriends came to Vegas on a Thursday and left on a Monday, we had the chance to eat here twice! If you come on a weekday for lunch, it's only about $25!! Highly recommended!! The food is really worth trying, especially if you get it at that price. I came here before for dinner also, and I believe that it's better than Wicked Spoon.

It didn't have a contemporary feel for a buffet anymore.  If I had come here when they first opened, I probably would have said the same about the once great buffets of nearly two decades ago like Bally's or the Rio.  This buffet along with the Bellagio buffet have been supplanted by the likes of Studio B, the Wicked Spoon, and Bacchanal.  Each of these buffets seem to be laid out better, more spacious and spread out in the design of their stations.  The offerings are more contemporary and compartmentalized;  instead of a whole chaffing dish full of food beckoning you to take as much as you like, the portions are more individualized and the emphasis is on making each serving more presentable.  The Wynn Buffet seems to be caught between something old and traditional and this new modern paradigm for Vegas buffets...

I noticed there wasn't as much variety in the selection, perhaps the emphasis is on quality.  What I've found was a more classic or traditional sensibility in the offerings:  When was the last time you've seen Oysters Rockefeller offered at a buffet?  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-buffet-las-vegas-6?select=sAiS6XgpbW_t-x46uHVAeg#sAiS6XgpbW_t-x46uHVAeg   I wouldn't expect too many millennials to know what that is. With that kind of thinking, I would suspect that they're trying to appeal to an older crowd but I would also think that the older crowd wouldn't dine too often on the strip at $40 a pop, stereotypically they would probably go downtown...

The theme when we were there was sort of whimsical, fairy tale like but elegant  judging from the decorations http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-buffet-las-vegas-6?select=Y-SG3-x0ICi64J2U2L8-Jg#_RZaiGeObU6AAfSf51A_KA.

As you enter you all you can see (what I would label) the garden area (which are usually the pictures that come up when you google image search Wynn Buffet).  I'm not sure what it takes to be seated there, but I feel as the lowly peasant I am I may never sit there.  As you walk further back you see dining areas to the side of the garden which makes it seem as if you are walking into the Tardis of buffets (bigger on the inside than the outside).There's even a bathroom and phone area.

Now to the food.  Not only was there tradition breakfast food, but other dishes that you wouldn't; expect such as veggie tamales, spring rolls, pizza, and even cheeses.  I stuck with tradition.  Mini waffles, pancakes (that they make right in front of you and you have your choice of toppings), little bricks of pepper jack hashbrowns, 2 types of french toast, eggs in many different ways (along with an omelet making station), blintz with sweet ricotta cheese inside, and your choice of dessert.

It was a feast for all the senses.  Lastly if you have any allergies or any other food problems, you can ask your server to have the chef take you around to help you with your food choices.  We saw this in action and think it's a great idea.

Food variety was decent but there were few meat options (one beef option, one chicken option). Food quality was surprisingly subpar. The pork buns were stale, the prime rib was fatty and tasteless, the sides were diner quality and below. They also lacked good pairing options.

Waiter provided iced coffee for us. (Not as good as our cold brew that we make at home but it was adequate.) 
Out of the dozens of buffets in Vegas we chose this one from the images and reviews online. A little more expensive than I had imagined but in this case a very good value. One thing I did not want to be was disappointed on one of our special evenings in Vegas.

We sampled about 1\/4 of the dishes (very small portions that we shared) I have very few critiques. The range of freshly prepared cuisines was broad.

Fresh oysters on the half shell, ahi poke, shrimp cocktail and easy to eat crab legs sliced cleanly lengthwise was something that I went back for seconds on. Not extremely exciting but very satisfying up to this point.

Next we moved to the Asian steamed buns (sharing each because they are very filling.) fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and pork belly fried string beans. The buns were fluffy and soft as they must be in order to pass inspection. Rice and chicken were adequate. Flavor of the pork belly string beans was awesome! String beans very fresh and crisp. Although they did not remove the string which is also something I do at home when I'm lazy or pressed for time. 

Meat carving.. an array of juicy and flavorful meats to choose from. Pork belly, beef ribs, rib eye, chicken, and several others. Had to contain myself here in order to get more out of the experience. I assure you all the meats are well executed and seasoned. 

The rest of my dinner was filled with grazing only the choice dishes from the many remaining stations of hot foods. I had salad for lunch so I avoided that altogether. Mac n cheese was good. Broccolini not over cooked as it so often is. Salmon nice and moist. 

Dessert! I was getting full at this point and mercifully they prepared this section in small portions. Due to the subjective nature of dessert I will merely tell you I was very satisfied. One note the cloves they added to the carrot cake was a very nice touch! I'm going to do that on my recipe.

Overall impression of the food quality.. a solid pass. I never had the impression that anything was old, stale, or over cooked. Meats, fish and veg were all perfect representations of the dignity of the ingredients. I will eat here again on my next visit.",1,0,1

Granted, the prices are expensive (dinner was $40+ per person) and the line was excruciatingly long, but the food was so good that all troubles from before were forgotten. First of all, it looks so fancy shmancy inside! And they have a huge selection of different types of food! Seafood, sushi, lamb, and a ton of other stuff! I especially loved the dessert section, where they make fresh crepes for you! That was easily my favorite part. All you can eat customized crepes? I would have ordered more, but my tummy could only handle one.

The food is of great quality, and everything I tried was delicious! My favorite ""combo"" was lamb, mashed potatoes, and asparagus (it was some pretty damn good asparagus--I've included a photo of this yummy combo).

The best buffet I've ever tried! And honestly, what justified the 5 star review for me was their desserts! The crepe I ordered was super delicious, and their creme brulee was good too (and I love creme brulee... I might have eaten a bit too much of it)!

I'M a BIG fan of Prime Rib, Crab Legs and Dessert, this is SO the buffet for ME! :D 

The PRIME RIB
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=jdfrkCcUITfPje_hj07FTg
Sure, I can go to a cheaper buffet with (sub)Prime Rib, but it wouldn't be as tender, juicy, melt in your mouth succulent like they have it here.  For the same price as this buffet (under $40 for dinner) I can get a nice prime rib somewhere swankier but that's all I'd get with no chance of a second or third helping.  

The CRAB LEGS
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=aHJgbggTOloF2UFOvyP9cg
The snow crab legs here are sweet, delicate AND delicious even BEFORE the butter and lemon.  But what fun would it be if you didn't dunk it in butter?!  I'm typically not a fan of this type and more of a dungeness crab kind of gal, but these are outstanding.  They are even split open for you and ready for easy picking!

The DESSERTS
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=cIYvAnaBHdm_ji688G7y-A
Tres Leches, Gelato, Chocolatey Brownies, Made to order Crepes, Key Lime tarts, Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Warm Bread Pudding with Creme Anglaise, really....I can keep going!  And there is distinguishable quality and they are definitely a couple notches above the mass-produced type stuff at the other places - presented in pretty little serveware and you can taste taste taste to your heart's content.

IMHO, these are the three core competencies that this buffet has.  OK, I admit - the sushi here is not great and might be better at the other buffets.  But does the other buffet have Truffled Pea Risotto?  Nope.  Does the other buffet have Roasted Fennel salad?  Nope.  Tom Yum soup where you can put in your own accoutrements?  Didn't think so.

Lucky for us we were with a buncha buffet professionals and we came for an early dinner - so there was no wait, and we split our large group into smaller tables (but still next to each other) so we would avoid the ""required"" 18% gratuity. We tipped well anyway, our servers cleared our table and topped off our drinks often and with a smile.

So if you like the cheaper buffets with a ton of food with so-so quality, this wouldn't be for you.  But if you like to surf and turf as the way I described above and a sweet tooth that won't stop, then go to the Wynn FTW!",7,6,7

Took my sister in law there and we have very different tastes in food.  Despite this, we both left very happy with the meal.  If only her flight was later as she was still pounding away on those crab legs.

I hate crab - and love red meat.  So I went initially with the prime rib (good and especially love the more well done and crispy\/fatty outer part), a veal short rib that was spectacular, and the salmon rillette on toast.  The salmon was delicious and the toast was constantly replaced so nice and crunchy on the outside\/soft on the inside.

You're not supposed to have bread at buffets but nobody tells me what to do.  And I heard the baker at Wynn was some big shot European guy they hired for huge dough.  Had their artisan bread - excellent!  

2nd go around  I basically had a 2nd serving of what I had the first time (minus prime rib).  That's the reason I give it 4 stars - the variety is somewhat lacking for me.  You go to somewhere like the M Buffet or even Bellagio and there's just more variety.  If you don't like some of the dishes (like pasta at a buffet is useless for me) then you're really stuck with only a few things.

In any case, service was great and my sister in law loved all the healthier stuff like crab and fruit.  I liked the fruit too.

The chef was great, personable, and very knowledgeable about the plant-based diet.  He walked me through every dish and nearly every ingredient, I felt like I was getting star-treatment.  At the end of my little tour I realized I could have at least half of the offerings on the buffet...and that, my friends, is exactly what I did.  I never get to eat at buffets, I exercise, and eat healthy at home, so why not?!?!  I enjoyed many things such as Alfredo pasta (custom-made at the pasta station), many different kinds of salads (quinoa salad, chickpea salad, etc.), many kinds of veggies, vegan tomato soup, sushi, ethnic dishes (aloo gobi, channa masala, etc.), candied apples, and the best vegan chocolate chip cookie baked on this planet.  Mind you, there were many vegan things I just couldn't get to...I filled up sooner than I would have liked.  Overall, this was a great experience, the Wynn is simply impressive.  I highly recommend the buffet to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike.",5,0,3

For AYCE, this is the best experience in terms of service, food quality, and selection. There is often the 45 minute wait during prime time, but when a restaurant is at capacity, you can't fault them for not having enough space. I love their deli meat and cheese selections. I like thin crust pizzas. Their customs omelets are awesome. I think the Asian food is okay but I eat plenty of that already being Korean. People seem to love the crab, but I'm not such a fan. Its a bit cold when you eat it. I like that they cut it half for you so it is the least messy experience I've ever had with crab.

Service is friendly and fast.

We like to finish with their mini tiramisu which is fantastic! It is really strong coffee flavor with all the right texture. We leave with a candied apple and full stomach.

Decent - Alaskan king crab legs, large shrimp, prime rib, pizza (altho crab legs needed more flavor -dip into butter)

Just okay - most of everything else. Lots of dessert selections including homemade ice cream but nothing blew me away.

Wimpy - they used to have a lot more sushi. This time the sushi rice was mushy and they barely had california and veggie rolls. Horrible sushi, esp given it's the Wynn. Reminded me of Costco refrigerated sushi. 

Terrible - Different types of fish were hard and overcooked. I used the thong to try to break a small piece of salmon off another larger piece, but the fish was so hard that I couldn't.

The selection was larger (esp the desserts!) than other buffets I've been to. The quality ranged from utter crap (sushi) to good (desserts). The prime rib, fish, omelets, etc were about average.

Yes, its a little pricey, but really $35 for dinner in Vegas for the amount and quality of food is not that bad.  There is a long line as well, but it doesn't seem any longer than other popular hotel buffets.  Anyway, back to the Wynn...

Holy cow, what a great buffet.  And speaking of cow, the Wynn served some of the tastiest prime rib outside of SF's House of Prime Rib.  The buffet serves a wide variety of food, all of which was delicious and fresh.  In particular, the seafood and pizza bars stand out.  Everyone waxes poetic about the split Alaskan crab legs, which are indeed meaty and huge, but why talk about the pizza?  Well, the Wynn features a large open pizza oven operated by a pizza guy who is tossing fresh pizzas every few minutes.  We get friendly with him and he offers to make us a personal pizza with whatever we want on it, given the ingredients that he has.  We get a white sauce pizza with sausage, mushrooms, bacon, and spinach- sounds mundane, but it was jaw-droppingly good.  The three of us ended up taking the entire pizza back to the table, where we then proceeded to demolish it within minutes.  The pizza, when fresh out of the oven, featured a crust that was thin and flavorful, crisp yet pliable enough to fold in half.  That pizza, along with the best tandoori chicken I've had outside of an Indian restaurant, succulent cocktail shrimp, deliciously crisp haricot verts, and fabulous dessert bar (I wouldn't be surprised if its the same gelato and sorbet that they sell at Sugar & Ice), made for an extraordinary meal.

Steve Wynn is known for being a perfectionist and it shows in the buffet and the little details.  For example, the table cloths were 100% Egyptian cotton and made in Italy.  I believe the silverware were Waterford.  The cocktail shrimp came with both tartar and cocktail sauce.  The entire place is very stylish, from the open kitchen feel of the buffet itself, to the modern, off-kilter stark white square plates and bowls.  The topiaries are made with real fruit, which included mangoes and whole jackfruit.  Service was great and attentive, though slightly slow.

Overall, a buffet that outshines all the others in Vegas.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I'm definitely making a beeline for it next time I'm in town.",7,5,7

I don't know what the hell it was but ew. Secondly was the beloved crab legs. I didn't know that they were cold!  I only like warm crab legs. I also didn't know that the mash potatoes, in the beautiful bowl, would be cold too, along with a number of other select items. No need to talk about the rest of the entrees because I gave up honestly, at the soup and potatoes. The only thing I did enjoy was the drink and the scallops (which could have been better).

Next is the the dessert. Oh that beautiful dessert. The little cute cupcakes was just that...cute...that's it. As far as taste, it tasted like a dry sponge. The key lime pie was toooo sweet. I couldn't eat it. The apple on the stick was cute too.

I have to make it 3\/5 because of the pizza (which I forgot to mention earlier) and the creme brulee. OMG, my two favorite foods in the world are what happens to be the best choices at the buffet.

First, I have to say, the Wynn Hotel, as well as the buffet, are gorgeous.  The service, provided by Melissa, was exceptional.  I went fairly early for dinner and was seated in less than 10 minutes.  Even though I dined alone, I was given a very nice table close to the buffet.  It cost $90, which included the food, endless wine pour (Melissa made sure I never had an empty glass nor a dirty plate on my table for that matter), tax and a nice tip.

Some items were rather bad though.  The chicken noodle soup tasted like it came from a can.  The turkey breast was heavily processed meat and not from a fresh turkey.  Both were overly salty.

I expected so much more from this since it is the WYNN! 

We went here for lunch today & waited over an hour to pay $29.19 (that's w\/tax) for what,nothing but the pretty ambience and somewhat ok desert


Shorts Ribs were so salty and dry with some!

One thing that was very good was the sauce for the pork\/shrimp dumpling which they have to serve you! You can't even take what u want!?? 

The Atrium\/decor was gorgeous, whimsical- food very blah! 

It's Vegas and even the cheaper hotels have crab legs and shrimp - NOT THE WYNN! 
This was VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE! 

Save your $29.91 and go to Flavors at Harrahs, even that was better than WYNN! My go to is Caesars Bacchanal! Worth every penny and freshest of food!",2,0,2

When I grabbed my first plate I was in awe at all the different types of gourmet cuisines.  I felt like Charlie when he visited Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory!   

Lemme tell you I got my grub on and with Yelp in mind I made sure to try out everything!  

Quality is key and the Wynn definitely  don't pinch pennies.  They have the plumpest shrimp cocktails, juiciest tender prime rib and a very proud salad selection (over 6 salad cups).

They have a Pasta station where you can choose type of pasta and ingredients (grilled cloves of garlic my fav).  

Meat station...was a hit!  Yummy sausage links, prime ribs, lamb and more.  The hispanic dude carving was a jerkoff tho- he kept saying ""neehou"" and I told him I wasn't Chinese and he still kept saying crap in Mandarin!  

Seafood station....was a miss.

DO NOT come for the CRAB!  Wynn serves cold crab legs and it's cut in half for you which is supposed to make it easier to eat but actually makes it harder to get out the crab meat!  For Seafood go to RIO SEAFOOD BUFFET- they have hot and cold crab legs and hot lobster tails too!

Dessert station...a miss.  It  faked me out!   The bright red candied apple was harder than a rock and I couldn't break the hard candy shell.  The creme brulee looked perfect until I took a bite and saw the custard was watery soup.  *pout*  Such a tease... I tried telling the lady worker that the Creme Brulee was bad but she didn't speak any English!

I was a bit disappointed at the Wynn Buffet after hearing such great reviews I expected more.    All in all it's a great buffet but there more misses than hits for me.  I give it a 4 star for presentation, selection and quality.  

BUT....Go to Rio for seafood crab legs and oysters,  Grand Luxe Cafe at the Venetian for yummy sandwiches and shrimp scampi and Wynn Buffet for prime rib.",6,5,6

I don't eat much to begin with, and usually buffet food just sits in food warmers forever, with people poking at it many times, and it just looks gross after awhile.  BUT... Wynn Buffet is a totally different experience!

First off the decor is wonderful and you don't feel like you're in a cheap buffet.  It wasn't very crowded either, so I assume they control the numbers so you don't feel like you're fighting for your food.  I felt the table service was very prompt and friendly as well.

Now for the food.  I went straight to the seafood section of course and got an enourmous pile of king crab legs.  Fantastic!  The crab alone was well worth the $34.  The selection here is amazing.  It's not just your ordinary buffet food, it's better quality and finer selections.  The food is always fresh since they dont have much sitting out at a time, and the flavors are much more refined.  The prime rib was just ok, but they had so many other choices!  Lamb osobuco, veal chops, mahi mahi, red snapper, ceviche bar, etc.  The options seemed endless and everything looked so appetizing.  Of course at some point I had to stop and save room for dessert (my fav part of any meal).

Dessert was quite good with a variety of cakes, creme brulee, ice cream and sorbets.  I was expecting a little bit more from the dessert selection, but overall it was good quality and everything tasted great.  I guess I can't complain about all you can eat dessert!

The transition from lunch to dinner wasn't too well coordinated, so it took some time before everything was switched over. Everyone was obviously hovering waiting for the crab legs to appear, so there was quite a line when those were finally put out. While I did gladly stock up on these, I was really waiting for the lamb chops. Sadly, these never made an appearance. And the meat counter in general was quite lacking. They had a giant ribeye, ribs, prime rib and a rack of lamb. Pretty sad compared to the array of meat Caesars had to offer. 

I haven't especially liked any dessert counter at the buffets I've been to (things always look pretty but don't taste great), and this one was no exception. After taste testing just about everything, the highlights were definitely the warm cookies, gelato, and creme brulee. The biggest disappointment was the crepe with filled with burnt, chunky nutella, with no option of banana as a filling.

Quick Tip for the people with champagne tastes on a beer budget: head down there about 3:15, you can pay the lunch price and about 3:45 they start rolling out the crab legs and nicer dinner entrees. So I think you will save about 10 bucks a person.

I liked the jumbo shrimp cocktail, dim sum, and cheese bar with grapes and dried apples.  The snow crab legs and skirt steak were on the salty side for me.  I was super disappointed with the sushi bar - only 3 kinds but no fresh fish that I remember.  I had the california roll and shrimp tempura roll which were tiny and flavorless.  Also wasn't impressed with the choice of soups, none of which sounded appealing so I didn't even try any.  No lobster tails.  There was a selection of 5 salads cutely presented in individual cups and the two I tried (thai beef salad and pear and gorgonzola) were nothing special.  Didn't touch the salad bar.

Unimpressed:
Eggs Benedict and their breakfast items (waffles, pancakes, eggs).. breakfast is not worth your calories here!
Baked mussels were not good at all, I grabbed a plate only because they brought a fresh batch out but the meat was teensy and sauce was salty.
Yellow Curry, which was their featured ""soup"" at the time. It tasted nothing like curry even though it was made to order
any of their Asian food.. it was just typical
Crepes, candy apples, and some of the dessert cups. They were meh

Selection of ceviche
Seafood pot pie
Cream puff with Raspberry filling -- this was yummy!
Gelato and flan here were tasty

The Wynn Buffet has got to be the other buffet that people kept telling me to eat....besides the Bellagio.

First of, buffet etiquette.  Do I HAVE to wait for all the slow ass crab leg grabbers?  I want some and without me having a well endowed chest, overweight, and me being male...I kept getting dirty looks as I moseyed my way to the legs in front of people.  So, like the rest of the lemmings, i get in line.  Look, I'm losing weight you bastards, just grab your damn legs and continue on...I'm in Vegas, but these buffets actually close here.

Crab legs are a must.  Which leads me to my second ""GGGRRRRRR.""

I need to contain the succulent butter sauce for my fresh crab legs....yet, me being Asian, fat, and semi blind...okay....ridiculously blind, i can't find a container that isn't for soup.  yes, i walked my fat lazy butt to the other side...

WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT CONTAINER ANT?

Side note, the slab of turkey meat will NOT, I repeat, WILL NOT contain and keep the butter sauce from encompassing the entire contents of your buffet plate....goodbye delicious Sea Bass, you are now butterfied. (I'm trying out a new non-word).  Try to make a small dish dam, if you will, with the mashed potatoes.  Or be smarter than I and actually ask for a small container..you would think they would be right by the stupid butter sauce container...it would have been the most obvious place to place such a dish.

There are only 2 stalls in the mens bathroom...choose wisely.  They are fully enclosed and have a nice frosted window for you to see shadows of other, wood-be crappers.

Okay, back to the buffet.

The meats are delicious...fish, crab legs.  You really can't go wrong.  i would admit i did enjoy the prime rib yet i think the Bellagio may have more flavor in their meats.  the thing for the Wynn is crablegs though.  The waiters are amazing and are able to help you with any type of necessity...tea works great after unnervingly consuming 2 sticks of liquid butter.  Stupid turkey, i thought your handle the butter....i think thee NOT.

There is also a crepe station in which one of my com padres was insistent upon.  The other desserts, cakes and stuff, are interesting and delightful.  A very nice compliment to the beginning 3 plates of food.

This is one of the must try for a Buffet in Vegas...stop buy...and the ashtray outside has a sign that says NO SMOKING for some stupid reason.",3,5,2

Went on labor day weekend dinner and there wasn't much of a line when we went which was nice. (Tip: ask to sit in the beautiful area with the flower trees if you can. It's closer to the food and it's nice to look at.) 

Did the typical buffet thing. Go for the crab legs and the prime rib. Crab legs were more like salt with a side of crab. The oysters next to it were pretty sad, tiny, dried little things. Prime rib was good enough and so was the brisket, but ribs and any other meat was SO DRY. My dad even said to the guy behind the counter ""if you eat it, then I will too..."" and the guy just shook his head and agreed with my dad. Also don't bother with the chicken dumplings.

Saving graces? Pineapple cup was pretty good, and any other fruit. The tuna wakame salad, cocktail shrimp, and the ice cream was also pretty good. 

One more thing that didn't help the experience. Whenever a table was cleaned up near me I could hear the waiters opening talking about the tips (good or bad) to the the other wait staff.

We went early in the afternoon and pretty much had no wait. The wait service was fast to clear plates and refill drinks and overall friendly. The place was very nicely decorated and the buffet itself was well designed and easy to move about looking for something to catch your eye.

A lot of the reviews talk about the crab legs so here is my two cents: they were good and they were huge. That us pretty much all my first plate had on it and I was not disappointed. In fact you need to be careful carrying the plate back to your table since so much of the crab legs overhang the plate.

I also enjoyed the prime rib, the rack of lamb, the sushi, and the salad bar which was very good in my opinion. I didn't really get into the desserts myself but my wife seemed to like them and she tried quite few different ones. 

I suspect that if you find yourself at the Wynn buffet you are on a vacation or away from home for another reason so I say indulge. Indulge big time. I did and it saved me money since I was literally stuffed for two days afterwards. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas (except maybe 5 pounds you gain) and that's why",1,0,1

Not the case.  When we arrived there was no line up.  Food on the buffet was decent but I cannot say it is worth the $39.99 weekend price tag ($43.33 after tax but before tip).  My favorite items on the buffet - beef brisket, pea risotto, smoked salmon, beet salad, thin crust pizza, forest mushroom spread.  Crab legs were not very tasty but I had to have them anyway since it seemed to be the only way to justify the steep price tag for the meal.

Forgettable food nominations are the 4 different sushi rolls (why bother), the tempura (too greasy), and chinese dim sum items (what was I thinking).

Watch out for the crazy rude people that jump the queue and lunge head first into the pile of crab legs and peeled shrimp because they cannot wait the 5 extra minutes to wait their turn in line to get them.  Some people seem ignorant of buffet line etiquette.

The food is consistent and good every time I have eaten here.  Having been adopted by the city, I have found myself frequenting buffets and gathering up notes on where to eat and where NOT to eat.  This was definitely a place to eat.  The highlights of this buffet were the harico vert (al dente and delicious!!), the juicy prime rib, brunch, and dessert.  Service has always been top-notch and the ambience is stunning.  It is a place worthy to stand against other buffet behemoths like Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal.

Note - I am not a huge breakfast eater in the first place so I am not sure I got my $40 worth foodwise, however, being the frugalista that I am, I certainly got my money's worth in mimosas!

The buffet spread is very large and in charge.  Lots to choose from (salads, charcuteries\/cheese, made to order omelettes, congee (woo!), pizza, sliced to order bacon, pork, prime rib, sushi, breads, cereal, fruit, oh and a whole little room devoted to desserts!  Another + about this buffet is that the serving sizes are very manageable meaning it is fresh\/replenished frequently and you (hopefully) won't gorge yourself on everything you see.  Also, they list any sketchy ingredients (gluten, shellfish, etc) for those allergic folks like myself so I really liked that.

Everything I tried was delish - standouts included the congee, cream puffs and kobe beef meatballs.  Our servers were prompt and very friendly despite our numerous requests for mimosa refills and napkins for our numerous spills (I can't take my friends anywhere! haha)

Don't get me wrong, everything smelled good, it was all presented very well, and the variety was great. But seriously. I was far from impressed.

I didn't really care for the anything. And I was there for a few hours (considering the fucking price, uh yea, I'm gonna take my sweet fucking time) and I tried probably everything. 

Umm...so I really liked the cheese selection and deli meats. And the crackers were good, too.

Everything else was pretty bland and boring. Maybe I came on an off day or something. Everyone around me seemed to really be enjoying it, but me and my party were just not pleased. They were generic flavors. No special seasonings, unique tastes, etc. It was pretty much...a really really fancy and super expensive Hometown Buffet?

AND FUCK THE DESSERTS. I love baked goods and cakes, I mean who the fuck doesn't?? I grabbed one of everything. I didn't finish any of them. I would take one bite and it just tasted like shit to me. Same with my friend. We were so displeased with them all. The mint chocolate cake was what I was most excited about. I'm almost certain the main ingredient was really strong toothpaste. It was that mint flavor. Not even mint gum flavor. Straight toothpaste.
