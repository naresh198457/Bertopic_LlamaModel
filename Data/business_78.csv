When you walk in it's super cute but small. Staff is very friendly and if it's your first time they are happy to explain their menu! They have a healthy side and a happy side on their menu. I'm sure you can guess why the happy side is called what it is. 

Food is really good, from what I've tried. I always order the ahi sirachi taco. They have 2 versions of this. The ahi sirachi is the one on the healthy side and surprisingly much better than the ahi taco on the happy side. And it's only like 3 bucks for one taco that is a pretty good size. It's a must if you go to SkinnyFATS.",0,0,0

The food was delicious I got the Hot Chix which are hot wings, meat was white and flavor was great.  
You have to try their jalape√±o ketchup it was the bomb.  Also I got one of their fresh juice drinks which left me wanting to have 3 more! :-)",1,0,0

While I was there I also tried a few things at my expense. We ordered the Greek flatbread, the Sweet Chesus, the shrimp tacos, and the salted caramel cookie. The Greek flatbread (Nice to Greek you) had grilled chicken, olives, feta, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, tzatziki, & balsamic glaze on a flat bread. It was 505 calories and I got it from the healthy side of the menu. For something that was supposed to be ""healthier"" it was pretty decent. My only complaint is that it had TOO much balsamic on it and I didn't see the point of the giant chunks of cherry tomato. Perhaps it would have tasted better and I could have finished in the restaurant, if the tomatoes had been thinly sliced and there had been less vinegar because it was SO bitter. On a scale one to ten the flatbread scored a 6. I probably wouldn't order it again to be honest. 
The next thing I ordered was the Sweet chesus which is skinnyfats take on a philly cheese steak. It's made with shaved ny steak, pepper marmalade, onions, pepper jack cheese, portobello, cheddar sauce on a hoagie. This was one of the best philly cheese steaks I've ever had. The meat was tender and the bread was soft. I'll definitely eat it the next time I return. (8\/10)
skinnyfats offers two tacos for 7.95 which I thought was pretty good deal for a sit down restaurant and You can mix and match! I chose two shrimp taco-dillas: tempura,spicy slaw, pico, chipotle aioli, pepper jack cheese, in a quesadilla shell. Let me tell you, these were the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The combination of the slaw and chipotle sauce made it sweet, salty, and spicy. So far these tacos are my favorite thing to eat on the menu and if I could eat them everyday I would. These tacos were absolutely AMAZING. (10\/10)
Lastly I had a salted caramel cookie and my mom who isn't a huge fan of sugar took one bite and fell in love. She said this was the best cookie she's ever had. The cookie could be described as how it taste to eat a really good slice of cake. All that was missing was some vanilla ice cream. Go order one of these cookies. You won't regret it! (10\/10!) 
All in all, this was an epic experience and I'm renewed as far as my thoughts about this place goes. Great customer service and great food. I cannot wait to come back and try the other food. SkinnyFats is a place you go if you're not afraid of flavor. Oh and the free wAter (so freshing) is a bonus! One of the best places in Vegas to eat. Don't miss out.",0,0,0

The space is quaint and small with limited tables and just a handful of barstools. I have been fortunate enough to always beat the lunch rush. Their walls are hand painted with  pictures of vegetables from what I could remember. 

I love their acai bowl aka SkinnyBowl and recently ventured to their Happy Side and ordered the ""happyness"". It is sliced pieces of steak with truffle fries. SO GOOD.

I could come here, be happy with the salad selection (beets and goat cheese for $5.50 is pretty good), get chix tenders for the kids and some of the raw juices (expensive at $9+), and my husband can come get a cheeseburger or cheesesteak.

The last time I was in Vegas I drove by here.... and kept driving. This place is in an office building complex. It doesn't look like much from outside, that's for sure. When you go inside, the place is clean and super hipster. The menu items are a good amount so you have options.

When you walk in to the cashier asks if you've been there before. If you haven't, like me, she explains how the menu works. It's pretty simple. They serve all the menu items literally from 9 AM to 9 PM.  This place is super super small so try to come during those non-rush hours. I went around 6 o'clock and there was already eight people there, and in about 10 minutes 10 to 12 people showed up... And I was feeling a little cramped. There are seats aligned along the window and lots of plug-ins for you to plug in your computer and or other fancy items... However that's the same wall that you have to walk past in order to get to the cashier, and there are four person settings directly behind where you're standing. So if you're the table directly in front of the cashier you are getting a clear butt shot of every single person ordering. Definitely not going to be my favorite spot to sit.

I finally figured out what I wanted to order. But also wanted to get the opinion of the cashier on what the most popular item was on the menu. She didn't know and rambled off one thing from each category. Not really helpful if you ask me. But she did recommend, if I didn't want something particular, they were happy to substitute anything for anything! That means literally unlimited mix and match combos! I do actually love that. So my order was The Caprizza for 8.95 and the off menu item fried pickles with a chipotle aoli for dipping. Oh... and A large black tea unsweetened. The total came to $17.47. Super pricey for the food items I actually received. The flatbread was about the size of my coach wallet. And was literally sitting on the cardboard! No wax paper down... No interference between literally my flatbread and the cardboard that it came in! When they drizzle the balsamic over my pizza while it was inside the box the balsamic literally was on the cardboard.  I was not a fan of that at all and will definitely not be ordering the flatbread to go again. I did however receive enough fried pickles to feed two or three people. I got this as a to go order because I wanted to eat in my hotel room and do a little work. I wasn't really a fan of the to go order because the food didn't really hold up. (I think???? I mean I haven't ever eaten at the restaurant... So I assume....) 

I would go back, and eat inside instead of togo. Maybe try some of their other items that looks pretty interesting... So definitely look for that in the next couple of days. I will update my review then. For now... I am at a firm 3 stars - disappointed :( ) 
------------------------
Ok..... update! Went back  ( Wed around 7pm ).  ZOIE BLEW MY MIND! Super high energy, Awesome job on welcoming me, knew the menu AND helped me on sifting threw what I wanted and didn't want - with out confusing me or overwhelming me on my order options! Great job ZOIE! She could even had some reservations about a condiment that came on my recommended burger, called me out on it, and excluded it for me... good job AGAIN zoie! 

I once again ordered to-go just to make it even... I ended up ordering chix on Broadway, my side was regular fries and I ordered a large black ice tea. ( see Togo order and sandwich attached ) when I opened it up it looked taken care of and nice and neat. After unwrapping and taking the first bite I was not disappointed! The sandwich was big and the chicken was hot, the coding was not too rough... As to mess up the roof of your mouth, you know what I mean people. The fries were hot and my ice tea was fresh. I was so glad to have a good experience with the food this time. I'd read all of these amazing reviews about it but didn't have the same experience as other people. This time it was much much better!

I gave them one more star because of the improvement of the food, and impressive attitude and knowledge of Zoie!! I look forward to coming back next month to see what the dining in experience is like.

Another update! I just received a message from Lana at skinny fats! She wanted to connect with me on my review to ensure that my customer experience was taken very seriously and was not taken lightly. I have to say I'm super impressed that she took the time to reach out to me and to offer me the opportunity to come back for a different experience. I had already gone back before I got the email... But it was super nice for her to extend the offer. GREAT JOB SKINNYFATS! That's the way to build a long lasting business!",5,4,8

Except the Kalefornia Love salad with chicken and portobello was decent, all other dishes were horrible. Smoke in a Bowl and STEAKation burger were totally plain, while the Caulifire was way toooooo salty and spicy. Note that I can eat pretty spicy and I specifically asked them to go light on the buffalo sauce on the cauliflower, since it was for my mom, who prefers less strong flavor.

The juices\/shakes were good. We asked for Beet It without basil or ginger, and a shake Mr. Green with banana, chocolate and whey protein.

I am generally a big fan of healthy food and have been to healthy food restaurants that are way better than this. Maybe it's not a good idea to divide the menu to a ""healthy side"" vs. a ""happy side"". You can be healthy and happy at the same time.",0,0,0

I thought I had an idea of what to expect through all the reviews, but even then I was still so surprised! This place does not seem like it belongs in Las Vegas, but maybe somewhere in California. It's almost like a restaurant inspired by Tumblr\/Pinterest with all the colors, art, and overall interior decor. I had slight difficulty finding the place since it's located in somewhat of a office plaza. Good thing they have signs on the light poles stating, ""SKINNY FATS - YOU JUST MISSED US.""

Anyways.. Me and my friend went during lunch time and all I got to say is that if you're planning on going here - TRY TO AVOID LUNCH TIME. This tiny place was packed! Luckily, they have somewhat speedy service and we were able to place our order. I opted for a healthy snack and a happy side which was the mini Gobbler and truffle fries. The mini Gobbler is basically a slider burger which upon appearance I thought I should have ordered more because there was no way this small burger and bowl of fries what going to fill me up.. Surprise! Surprise! I ended my meal with a full stomach and I didn't feel totally gross. I've never had a turkey burger and found this one to be very appetizing. I definitely did not feel guilty eating it and found my hunger satisfied.

I want to make a trip back here and indulge on a happy entree. This place matched up to my expectations and more. I left giving it a 2 thumbs up along with a 5-star rating.",2,0,1

We ordered multiple items during our visit and their flexibility with substitutions makes this establishment overly desirable. This place is a great place to visit if you're sharing so you can get a little bit of everything! They also sell items varying from breakfast to burgers so you can really come here during all hours of operation. 

The only downfall is its random location and size. It was really difficult to find since the sign is on the smaller side. Since it was also really busy, it was hard to find a a spot to sit.

My husband and I didn't need it, but it was nice to see this option for those who do. The place is located in an industrial strip mall with no other restaurants around it. You can't miss the place though due to the graphics used for their signage. Inside they offer a few counter seats and less than ten tables. We came during a busy Saturday after Black Friday and there was a line congregating all the way to the outside. You can peruse the menu while waiting in line but it moves pretty quickly. 

I ordered a Classic Burger with a side of Yummus (their play on words for hummus) served with cucumbers (you can opt for pita bread as well). I picked my side so you don't have to get that combo. I substituted their SF sauce (which looked like a thousand island based sauce and pink) for mustard. Mine also came with a fried egg (I asked for sunny side up). My husband ordered the chicken and waffles with fried eggs on top. 

My burger was good but nothing special. I really enjoyed the hummus though- thick, yet creamy and with a good lemon flavor. 

I think my husband's dish was way better. 

Unique concept and pretty creative dishes made for a cool visit. It is far from the strip but there is a billboard right above the restaurant to help you locate it. Despite its odd location, it is super busy so I think that is a testament to its popularity. 

Service quick and friendly. You order at the front and take a number, find a seat and they bring everything out to you. There is cucumber and lemon flavored spa like water for self serve in paper cups, if one desires.",1,0,0

Two of us got their daily special sandwich which was their salmon parm hoagie... OMG the bread was so light and the salmon cooked perfectly - big and juicy with lots of parm cheese and that tomato sauce!!  I was SO stuffed but it was SO GOOD!!!

My girlfriend loved her teriyahi - which is seared teriyaki ahi tuna with a citris slaw on 9 grain bread... so light and tasty - paired with their awesome sweet potato fries!!

And the last dish was the Thai Cobb which is a salad with their perfectly cooked warm teri-salmon with romaine lettuce, mango peppers, bacon and a yummy sunny side egg!!  I wish I had enough tummy room to eat that TOO!!!

Service as usual was AWESOME... they are so good to clean up the tables right away and will help get more chairs to so everyone is seated.  Wish they had a bigger space but we made do!!

First of all, the name SkinnyFATS is adorable and really represents what this restaurant is all about. This restaurant is perfect for those with conflicting friends that 1. want to eat healthy 2. want to pig out. It caters to both which is awesome!

Located at a really random and isolated area but it was easy to find. From the outside it may look like a huge place but inside is quite tiny and has limited seating. They have some tables and a bar like area by the window. It's first come first serve seating so you might want to have a friend grab a table while you order. The atmosphere and decor of this place is so chill and cute! Very woodsy but also artsy as well. The service here is amazing! The workers are friendly and they give great recommendations. 

They offer what they consider 'happy' and 'healthy' food on their menu so you have the option of going for either. They have an extensive menu with lots of options to choose from. I wanted something light for dinner so I ordered:

--Ahi Srirachi: It's seared ahi in a whole wheat soft taco with some slaw, mango, pico, and spicy yogurt aioli. The price is per taco and I ordered two tacos. I was going to order three but the girl advised that it may be too much so I listened to her. Two tacos was the perfect amount for me. This was so delicious it made my mouth water after the first bite. The ahi was fresh and the sauces and garnishes for the tacos made them the best ahi tacos I've ever tried. The mangoes were a nice touch as well.

They had tons of options and both the skinny and fat sounded delicious. I ordered the curry noodles (from the fats side) and the guy who took my order asked me if I wanted to add protein to it. Since I have been a pescatarian for about 6 months now, I decided to add shrimp. My friend ordered a burger I think, and we shared a side of the cauliflower. I liked everything, I didn't give them 5 stars just because the description of my plate said ""crispy chick peas"" and they weren't so crispy, also because the cauliflower didn't have that much flavor. But other than that, everything was good. I also had a juice that was called the Hangover Curer. It was really good, and they have these cool plastic cups that are very resistant and can go in the dishwasher so you can reuse them, I loved that.

The line was out the door when we were leaving!

Coffee is refillable so its a plus, They have spa water outside for you if you don't want to purchase a drink. The menu has really punny names which I think is super cute. Not only do they serve food, they also have some cool juices to offer ( I didn't try that). 

I got steak eyes to split with a friend since we weren't that hungry. It was pretty cool, it's essentially an egg (cooked to your choice) on top, with country fried steak and a biscuit on the bottom. Kind of placed like an eggs benedict. I really enjoyed it and I think the biscuit was AMAZING! 

The food is good and I think the price is a little on the pricier side. meals are good to split if you're not too hungry.",1,1,1

Had the HappyMess off the secret menu, truffle fries topped with blue cheese, steak, and pico de gallo.

For the second visit, arrived a little before noon and was able to snag a table for four, something we wouldn't have been able to do if we got there any later. Had the ChickHumm, grilled chicken breast with hummus, sprouts, tomato, and onion on a whole wheat bun, also added avocado (+$1). It was super tasty. Also had a Ahi Srirachi taco, good, but not as good as I remember; I may just be getting tired of them as that had been a go-to.

First - had to order the ""punch"" it was a nice blend of tropical juices. I believe it was blended, because it was pretty thick. A couple of shots of rum would have made my day! Lol

During my first trip I just ran over during my break and grabbed the Acai Bowl. I love my Acai Bowls and this one was pretty good, possibly the best I have had in Vegas although Daily Kitchens is also amazing not sure which one I like more. 

During my second trip I picked up dinner for me and my girlfriend on the way over to her house. She got the boneless chicken wings they were a little spicy for her taste but I didn't mind it. The order says it comes with 3 or 5 I can't remember but they ended up giving a couple extra which made for nice leftovers the next day. I got the cheesesteak, I replaced the blue cheese with American I think. I'm a big cheesesteak fan, this one was a little untraditional but it was good. The steak inside was very tasty! I ordered truffle fries as my side dish and those were super good. 

The only downside to Skinny Fats is that it's a really small place and every time I have been there it has been packed which results in a wait. Tried to go one morning for breakfast (I really want to try the breakfast, I've seen the dishes people are eating when I've been there and it looks amazing!) but turned around cause the line was too ridiculous.

 The cran-turkey and side of fruit - served on a yummy grain roll, the patty is speckled with cranberries and also has a cranberry yogurt spread, so fresh and delicious

Tu-nuts- Any sushi place serving a dish piled with THIS much tuna would be $25, and here its just over $6!!! they really pile on the tuna. I normally dont care much for raw seafood but this was amazing, served on a bed of crunchy asian slaw and hollowed out cucumber, personally a better way to eat fish if you're craving sushi, the rice always leaves me with a bellyache. This is perfection.

Hot-mame- sweet and spicy, great sized portion. 

Beet juice, and a tea.. My friend got the beet juice, and said it was amazing. I got the black tea with lemon and sipped on it all day.

A lot of their food ranges from sandwiches, burgers, tacos, bowls, and they even serve breakfast all day. I originally though ""man the Happy side does like delicious"" but I actually ordered two items from the Healthy side which was the Ahi Srirachi taco (Happy side has tampura ahi tuna tacos) and Naked Chix (a seared chicken bowl served over brown rice).

Naked Chix - dish was light and delicious, while the chicken was sort of bland, the brown rice was great and the whole dish worked with the mango salsa it had on it, the bowl also comes with a yogurt sauce which went interesting with the chicken. 

Ahi Srirachi taco - a rather big taco for only $3.50 and it has nice flavors to it, it is also light and has a great mixture of mangos, some slaw and a delicious srirachi aioli sauce. There was plenty of tuna in this taco as well.

I can see us going back here really soon. Everything was delicious, even their water which had oranges, strawberries and such in it. 
I hate how small this place is though. We were there for lunch and many people were leaving or taking food to go since there was nowhere to sit. I wouldn't want to take food to go from here. It is nowhere near home, nor anywhere else you can go sit and eat. All around this place is very good. Just be wary of going in at typical lunch times. It cleared out a bit by 3pm. Around 1:30 though there was nowhere to sit. 
I can't wait to go back and try some different things. I dot eat meat, so there isn't a vast amount of things I can eat, but there is a few good choices.",2,0,0

Honestly it kind of feels like the cooking is getting sloppy. I ordered the classic and of course there was a long line and the place was crowded so i was expecting to wait a good 20 minutes or so for my food. I got my food in like less than 10 minutes of ordering. That was a red flag. My fiance got the smotherload and his food came out at the same time. My fries were not hot and they were really stale and cold like they were yesterday's fries. Burger was ok luckily my meat was hot but it was probably thrown in a microwave or something. The potatoes in the smotherload were still hard and not cooked all the way. The food was done half fast. My fiance ended up getting sick right after on the drive home. Like i said i love this place but PLEASE cook the food fresh. I know the place gets super busy but when the food comes out crappy people do notice.,0,0,0

People - The people working here are so cool.

Music - The music is awesome.

Menu - Very expansive and requires some studying and many items on the menu are unique and quite creative.

Location - Odd at at best. 

Prices - Fantastic prices.

Quality of Food - Darn good and very different!

Quantity of Food - Just about right. Some humongous burgers.

Nutritional Value - This is why they get a minus 1.5 star.  No nutritional information on their food. No known idea on grams of sugar in their foods, or even the carbs, or the cholesterol.  They talk and create a menu that has many buzz words that sound health like add protein, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, yogurt and all.  Again, all great stuff, howver, we all know that the amount of sugars in any of the sauces can be absolutely off the charts.  I did ask the staff about nutritional information and their answer was a bit odd.  ""We serve healthy food and happy food. It is all on the menu."" 

I will be coming back for sure, and at the same time, I would urge everyone to be very careful as you need to be careful about the fact that there are a lot of healthy items on here and at this time, just not sure if it leads to a healthy recipe.

NO matter what, great tasting stuff for sure.

 I ordered the smotherlode. On the outside you could say it is a breakfast burrito.  once you get into it, you will see it is much more.  filet meat cooked perfect and soft.  Sausage with just the right flavor. potatoes and grilled veggies.  it was awesome.  
 My wife got the chickawaffaloplis. A perfectly cooked waffle with a smotherlode of chicken fingers on top. There was so much chicken. the crust on the chicken had a sweet tinge to it. she killed it.

You will think you are in the wrong place but the huge billboard will tell you otherwise.
It is in the front row off the plaza, to the right of the billboard.

Same delicious food as the other locations.
This trip our table had smoke in a bowl, the meatloaf sandwich special and the Benny special. Don't forget the frickles!!!!

Always get the frickles. Lightly breaded, you get a crunch and get there pickle flavor. Most places bread so heavily you don't know you're eating a pickle.

Smoke in a bowl pleased as usual.

Meatloaf sandwich had mashed taters on it. Was very tasty and quite the mouthful.

The Benny was over a fried backed potato which was my last favorite base of any of the Bennys I have had so far. The flavors worked well together.
The poached eggs was a solid yolk, this seems to be standard, out of the five Bennys I have had across the three locations I have had one runny yolk.

This place is off the Strip but worth the short drive. There is a huge billboard above the restaurant to indicate exactly where is it. It's pretty small inside and there's open seating, so expect to wait on busy days. They don't take reservations. To-go is available and when I was there, a good 1\/3rd of the people in line were there to pick up orders. 

The Food:
We ordered the Wrap Supastar (chicken, spinach, egg white burrito, Cajun cilantro yo, avo pico) from the all-day breakfast section and the Smoke in a Bowl (agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onions, pineapple, black bean salsa, cilantro yo, jasmine rice) from the Things in Bowls section. The Wrap Supastar is served as a wet burrito with the Cajun cilantro sauce drizzled on top. Loved the flavor and liked how it didn't leave you with that heavy feeling you can get after eating regular burritos. The Smoke in a Bowl was sweet and tangy. They were very generous with all the ingredients which made for a satisfying meal. 

Tips:
* Call ahead to check on the wait time. Calling the number on the Yelp profile will take you to the main number for all the locations, so make sure to choose the correct one. 
* If ordering to-go, you can order online.
* Parking is available but most of the nearby spots get taken first.",2,0,1

Maine wedge add steak!! The dressing mixture has egg, blur cheese, cucumber, red onion, balsamic demi, and ranch. I LOVE this salad it makes me, well, happy!

Ahi taco san- sooooooo yummy the puffed tortilla gives awesome texture to the tempura ahi and the mango salsa adds a freshness to the taco.  

Jazz hands float - sounds crazy right? A sprite float with mango. It's amazing!

Phatty philly- order this with extra blue cheese. This sandwich almost requires a fork and knife because there's so much meat!!!! 

Does the location suck? Hell yes! However even with my 2 kids and husband we almost always get a table.  If you're eating solo the bar stools are the way to go.

UM dear SkinnyFATS,
yes.
This place is seriously a gem.  It's a cozy artsy little restaurant, kind of randomly placed between the airport & SpyOnLasVegas, which was pretty unexpected.  Anyways, you walk in [but first you take a couple selfies outside next to the big smiley face mural on wall] order your food at the counter & they serve it to you.
I opted for the chicken & waffles, because in most food situations I'll opt to swing on the fat side [it's fine, I got a veggie juice after].  The chicken was perfectly crispy & very seasoned, and it harmonized seamlessly with the generously sized Belgium Waffle.  It was a large portion and filled me up.  Friendly service!

When I got the salad and *tried* to eat it, the steak was literally so overcooked it was like chewing gum. I could barely cut through it, let alone chew it. So I took it back in and asked if they could make it again with the steak even more rare. I got my order again within record time with what I'm pretty sure had to be the same steak I just gave back to them (only less of it, since some I had started to cut up), and probably just as overcooked, or even less rare than last time, and closer to well done (no pink or red area in the middle at all). This is by far not a 4.5-star steak salad by any stretch.

The service and courtesy of the staff were fine, and everything else about the establishment seemed pretty high quality. But I could cook a steak better in my sleep than these guys could. Waste of $12 bucks. I ended up only eating the rest of the salad as I didn't want to bother going back in again to let the cook know he had no idea how to cook a filet mignon.

Bottom line: if you're going to bother asking people how they want their steak cooked, know how to do it right. Otherwise, you're just setting the customer up for disappointment. And this was not only a disappointment, but an embarrassment when I went in to ask for it to be done right, only to get the order again just as bad or worse than it was the first time.

Edit: the manager replied to my review and apologized, and offered me a generous credit for the next time I happen to be in the area.

The stars must have aligned when we visited on a Saturday night, since we easily found parking and didn't wait for a table - and we got here at 6:30? I'm not gonna question it, but I can see how frustrating it could get since this place is pretty tiny.

I wanted 1 Healthy, 1 Happy, and it took me about a solid 10 minutes to decide on what to eat. I ended up ordering the Naked Chix (Healthy: mango chicken on rice) and the Ahi Taco San (Happy: ahi tempura on a puffed shell) - both very satisfying after a day of hiking.

I ordered the meltdown (patty melt). I ordered it medium rare. Came out cooked all the way through but I didn't mind because I was starving. Truffle fries on the side complete the meal nicely. I feel like the burger had a lot of meat. I only ate half. 

Person taking my order was amazing. She offered me bacon and avocado on my burger which after being offered I just couldn't say no. Great Up Sell!! All employee encounters were amazing. Friendly people working quickly and efficiently. Now that I think about it I am amazed that everyone worked so well together. I have had a lot of bad service lately and can really appreciate the great service I received here. 

Food came out hot and fast! Great food and great experience even though I wasn't feeling good.

The BF were at a awkward time where we needed to get something to eat, but not be too full so that we couldn't eat dinner later with friends so we decided to split some items. 

The Cherry Popper came recommended by the guy at the counter so we went with that. Now I loved the flavor components, enjoyed the banana peppers and sauce, but the burger was way too wet. The patty came piping hot and was not rested so the red juices were still oozing out and the slaw\/banana peppers were also wet ingredients that contributed to the lake the bottom bun sopped up within minutes. No one loves wet bread so they should toast the buns well, let the meat rest and strain the accompaniments to make this burger the superb star it could be. My picture shows there is a puddle between my burger and fries. You get a choice of side and we grabbed truffle fries which I thought was seasoned perfectly and had a nice crisp. I like that they offer jalapeno ketchup as well on the table! 

We also got supposedly the most popular item on the menu according to the guy at the counter - the seared ahi taco. We just picked the two popular items to try than delve off it. It was just aight. The components were fresh enough, but the flavor wasn't anything wowing. Good, not great. I also am someone who believes deeply in heating the tortilla to give it a nicer pliable texture but this was just straight out of the bag wheat tortilla. After the fact I see in pictures CRUNCHY tacos and on their website describe a ""puffed shell"" that probably would be way better and my opinion would have been different. We weren't asked if we wanted crunchy or soft so I don't know if you have to ask or they substituted.

I like the ideas of what they are doing here, the menu ideas are all very enticing. Maybe it was a slightly off day, but it's the execution that fell short for me. Details make a winner. If our bun wasn't soggy and our tortilla was nice and chewy this was a very easy 4 stars. I will be back though to give them another shot though as I suspect there's gotta be something bringing people to this inconvenient location. 

FYI There will be a 2nd location opening up on Durango and Warm Springs which while not in my hood, is very convenient as we're always at our friends home in the SW. Keep an eye out as there is just a coming soon sign in the shopping center Mac Shack is in.",2,2,2

Will eating here make me skinny? Hahah, I wish! I'm so glad I found this spot though. It's in an unassuming lot and small. It's close to the 15 and the service is quick. You pay, wait for your food, eat, and leave. I like this kind of efficiency.

Portions are big, and juicy. I had the Smotherload, and was it a mother load...of deliciousness! There's cheese, pico, and tender steak pieces smothered with a delicious cheese on top. I won't get skinny off this, but I'll definitely come back for more!

When this place started up, it got a lot of hype, mainly thru the social media sites. This joint is located by warehouses and factory offices, which seemed a little out of place. 

I decided to check this place out with a very good friend of mine. Upon entering, I noticed that it's not your typical restaurant. It's a little too congested for my liking with very little room to move about. The tables felt very cheap and light and the chairs aren't sturdy. More so, the place was jam packed when we went. 

Skinny Fats caters to a niche' which seem to belong to the health conscious, gym goers and people that are watching their weight. While they try to market all these ""healthy food""  and various substitutes, I can't help but notice that most people that eat here are either gym rat elitists or the annoying calorie counter snobs. 

The first thing that caught my eye is that the prices are crazy expensive, especially for the size portion that you're getting. I understand that you're paying more since they ""supposedly""  use ""healthy""  ingredients but $9 bucks for a smoothie? Definitely gonna be the last time I'd order something like that. My friend ordered a salad with some chicken and a blended shake which cost her $20 bucks. 

To be fair, this review is more on the atmosphere and the vibe that it gave me rather than the food itself. My friend enjoyed her lunch so ultimately, I guess that's what counts. 

I definitely won't be a regular at this place but would I come back? Sure, I'd be down to give it another go. Maybe my perception will change but until then, it's an overpriced health nut food joint in my book...",3,3,2

It's been two hours waiting for five meals, no food could possibly be good enough to make the wait worthwhile.

The location is tucked away in a warehouse center, and the closest place of interest is the Hustler House, if that's your type of thing. I was really confused why this restaurant found its way here. I think it could do even better in a hotel or maybe closer to UNLV or possibly in Town Square.

The restaurant is much too tiny. My cousin and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and even though we were able to find a seat rather quickly, everything felt so cramped. We came here with a baby car seat, and I do not recommend that. This place is best visited in pairs. You will not enjoy dealing with big groups here.

Now for the food. Surprisingly, there aren't really any desserts. But oh my goodness. I still loved my food! The portions are very generous for the prices. I had the Drunken Gypsy Toast and the Ahi Taco-San. Yum!

I wasn't expecting the toast to taste that sweet! It was delicious! I probably could have used more whipped cream, but it was still a lovely dish. Aesthetically, it looked gorgeous. All of the fruits were fresh and sweet. My bacon was good, too!

The Ahi Taco-San was excellent. The tuna was cooked to perfection and all of the stuff that topped the taco was scrumptious and paired well with the tuna. There were jalape√±os in it, which I'm not a fan of, but I totally didn't mind them in this taco. Everything about this taco was to die for, haha. And it was so decently priced!

In depth review: SkinnyFats has a solid buzz on the streets on Vegas with the locals at the current moment. Decided to try it last Tuesday and I am glad that I did. Really cool and hip casual vibe inside. Felt very comfortable and the staff was really nice and welcoming. Could tell they liked working there. 

I order the ""Cranburky"" (Turkey Burger) (($10)) off ""The Healthy Side"" w\/ a side of sweet potato fries and the lady ordered the ""More Cow Bowl"" (($11.25)) off ""The Happy Side"" of the menu. In addition we ordered an iced tea and a fresh squeezed orange juice. The total was about $30 for he both of us. Sat down and it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. They will bring it out to you. 

First impression is ""Wow!"" They give massive sized proportions. I had a giant plate of fries next to my turkey burger. My burger was amazing. Could taste every fresh ingredient and it was not greasy or messy at all. One of the better turkey burgers I have had in town. Will order this again and I highly recommend it. The sweet potato fries were stellar and very tasty!

The lady had the Teriyaki filet bowl and said the meat was delicious. She had a complaint that I can vouch for as I sampled it. The fried rice in the bowl was wet and soggy. Too much juice from the meat and veggies and it ruined the taste of the fried rice. Could do a better job straining the fluids before they add the meat \/ veggies. Actually turned bowl upside down and strained a good amount of water from it right at the table. She still ate and enjoyed it. We had enough left over for a second tasty meal. They give you a lot! 

Juice was also steep in price. $8.50 for a 24 ounce OJ is a bit much. That's my opinion.

It's tiny, though. You'll have a hard time finding a seat during dinner time, esp. on the weekends. It's open seating, fyi. The menu is split into two sides, the ""skinny"" side that has healthier options and the ""fat"" side that is more comfort food. All the items have some kind of unique, gormet flare. Like the choice between sweet potato or truffle fries (fries made with truffle oil and spices). You can definitely tell everything is hand made and fresh, and all items served look as pretty as a picture in a magazine. Seriously, it all looks good. They even have a giant water cooler with fresh fruit cut inside so you can have delicious infused water if you don't feel like buying a drink.

The things I'm not fond of: the lack of seating, the lack of diversity in the menu, and the prices. The menu has items like a burger with eggs benedict on top, but that's the only burger. It's not an enormous menu, and a lot of the items included on it are sweet breakfast foods like pancakes. I love the truffle fries but with the menu as it is, I don't feel the need to go there more than once a month. 

Also, it's very expensive. I'm kinda' surprised by the prices. But still, it's got some great twists on food and an fun atmosphere, so I'm still a fan.",2,0,1

We decided to go with the Cherry Popper (since it was our first visit) and the Smoke-In-A-Bowl. We picked the skinnyFATS punch smoothie to drink along with one of their craft sodas made with sugar cane. I decided to also try one of their salted caramel cookies for dessert. The staff was extremely friendly and engaged in conversation with us. The food itself came out quick and was well prepared. The Hawaiian bread on the Cherry Popper burger was both delicious and unique. Our smoothie was extremely refreshing and the reusable cup with a happy meter was also a cool touch!

The staff was smiling, courteous, and knowledgable.  Chicky behind the counter knew the menu and offered suggestions. The selections are varied and unique, with choices for those who are health conscious and choices for those who've already met their soul mates. 

The food arrived promptly and exactly as ordered.  I had the Chickhumm with fries and a side salad. The Chickhumm was a large portion, with √ºber-fresh toppings and a super soft bun.  The fries were stiff and seemed saturated with grease - slightly unpleasant but edible.  The salad was ultra-crisp, like freshly ironed sheets! And the fat-free ranch was tangy and thick.

A steady stream of incoming patrons reassured us that we'd made the right choice for dinner.  And at just over $30 for two people, it proved to be a tasty bargain.

Overall, a very enjoyable experience at SkinnyFats.  I'm certain we will return again.",2,2,2

 Chix on Broadway - delicious. Too much lemon aioli for me but that's just a preference and I know for next time to ask for it on the side. 
Phatty Philly - good size and taste but not really a philly. A philly has shaved or thinly sliced meat... not chunks of meat. Not that I'm complaining about taste because the meat was good.. but when you see Philly its what you expect and what we ordered it for.

Is the bun vegan?
How is this made?
Is there cheese mixed in?
Is there any animal stock\/broth in it?
Does the sauce have any dairy?

She did not bat an eye, roll them into another universe, huff, sigh, or ANYTHING! She answered EVERY SINGLE QUESTION without hesitation!

I ordered the Mean Bean Vegan Burger and it was a hearty burger. Typically vegan burgers are thinner and not as filling but this burger is where it's at. They also give you a nice serving of sweet potato fries.

Also, I split the ZUCC IT dish with my sister. There were a lot of zuchinni noodles and veggies and the arribiata (italian for angry) is a spicy sauce. It all worked!

On my first run at this place I probably would have given 4-stars, but I'll say my rating is more like a 3, but bordering on 4, if they fix a few issues.

First off the place is small, too small for the amount of traffic it gets. I realize they can't do anything about this, but still. Secondly, I waited for my food FOR-E-VER the last time I was here. Eh, I know these can be day-to-day issues, I'm not docking them for it, it's just me being a whiny patron.

Here's the real deal - I ordered a Cranburkey with a side salad. The salad came out with the ranch cup tipped all over my salad. Presentation not so great. Salad - good. Next came the Cranburkey. Presentation - terrible. I'm used to following SkinnyFats on Instagram and their pictures of their food looks SO GOOD, and so nicely plated. So, I was disappointed. I thought, the taste will make up for it!

The Cranburkey had a dry bun. The turkey was cooked well enough - but kind of bland. The cranberry-type gravy was all right, but not enough to have me desiring it again. The arugula-mix on the burger was wilted, and not terribly fresh. I picked a bunch of it out. Overall - an OK meal, therefore my rating is ""A-OK"". 

Not sure I'll be back. It's kind of out of the way from where I live and where I work. We'll see.",2,0,2

There was absolutely no problem substituting items or making changes to meet my needs. I often feel bad asking, but Cayla & Collin acted like it was no big deal at all, which was very nice. I ordered the bean burger, and I substituted the bean patty for a turkey patty, and got the lettuce wrap instead of a bun, with sweet potato fries. My guy, who does not eat healthy, had a cherry popper burger and Snicker- doodle cookies. My order was to go. When I got home, our order was exactly how I ordered, and it was delicious!!! We both enjoyed our dinner so much, that we went back the following night to try the breakfasts for dinner. Again, my order needed to have substitutions, and it was no problem at all.

The burger they have is still my favorite. I only knew about this place because of Charity Faith recommendation on her facebook page and positive people seem to lead to positive outcomes so I went. I would have given 5 stars but I have 2 gripes. They need a bigger place because they have a pretty good thing going and it seems like a lot of people are enjoying their experience there. My last gripe is I really dislike them serving things that have to be cut on pizza pans. If I have to cut a burger with a knife and it bottoms out to the pan it makes that chalk board screeching sound.

All in all a great place to eat, prices are decent.

I want to also say that the first time I was there it was busy and I see a lot of reviewers have been there when its packed. Sit with a stranger and stop being so walled off, you might meet your next best friend.

Changed my star rating to 5 from 4 since they now have nice plates and I eat here like once a week and we sometimes try new stuff they have on their menu and they don't have any food there that is anywhere near less that damn good.

The naked Chix was delicious and the fries were perfect. The green mile is tasty but too sharp. It was not for me but I would definitely drink it if I felt like crap about my body or was bloated. The green mile makes you feel that all the alcohol, fatty foods, and bad gunk in your body will be cleansed and washed away.

I was immediately drawn to the protein waffle with fresh fruit and turkey bacon (although turkey bacon made we worried). Overall it was fabulous and I ended up loving the turkey bacon!

The waiter and other people helping out were fantastic, friendly, interested, and even burned our bacon so it had the crispy flavor that my wife loves!  To be clear, the bacon was cooked fine the first time, my wife just prefers the more crispy bacon! :-)

From the funky decor to the wholesome ingredients, SkinnyFats looks as if they are attempting to make a positive impact on the Las Vegas dining scene.

That being said............. The food was not what I had expected. 

I really do like the healthy\/indulgent theme and the service is really good, it's just....Ahhh.....I don't know...... As you can see, I am struggling a little bit with this one. 

I had the Phatty Philly with the truffle fries, a soy milk blueberry shake (kids menu) and half of Vannesa N.'s sugar cookie.

Let me start out by asking, what is the big deal with truffle fries? I mean, they are good and all I guess. I just think they taste like normal french fries do. Maybe it's just me. So yeah, they were decent. The Philly looked amazing on the plate, but once I dug into it, I noticed there were like, four or five pieces of meat, and the rest were mushrooms. I like mushrooms, but when it comes to a Philly, you want MEAT, and the mushrooms are almost like a garnish. This was like a 50\/50 ratio of meat and mushroom. The city of Philadelphia would be pissed if they knew! Plus, it was very oily.

The shake I ordered was off the kids menu, because honestly, the shakes on that menu looked tastier than their grown-up counterparts. I ordered the blueberry one, and they gave me the option of having it made with 2% milk or soy, as well as having ice cream or frozen yogurt. I thought that was awesome. I like having choices, so this was a plus for SkinnyFats in my eyes.

After our meal, Vanessa, Marie and I just sat and chatted. While doing this, Vanessa decided on a sugar cookie (she was sitting like, two feet away from the glass case they are held in, so I'm not surprised). The cookie came out room temperature first, and it was not so impressive. Marie T.'s friend that works there noticed that Vanessa was not thrilled with the cookie, and brought out another one, this time warm. It was better. MUCH better. Still not thebomb.com, though.

I will admit, this was only my first trip. And I didn't really order what my gut had told me, which was the french toast. I think I will try the breakfast next time, then update my review accordingly.",8,4,6

There was only 1 other group eating in the resturant when we arrived and by the time we finished there was four other groups. Good decor on the inside which keep things interesting, however in the night there is not much lighting and it is very difficult to see everything but the lit-up menu. Staff was friendly and helpful in their recommendations. 

For food we ordered the Meltdown which was a half pend of beef with Caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, aioli and tomato between two sourdough pieces of bread, and then grilled.- So good. I also was able to share the Cherry popper burger which is a wee bi spicy with flavor nonetheless. I was not a huge fan of the coleslaw on it however, and next time might try a burger patty with other toppings. The third member of my party ordered the GOAT salad with Goat cheese, Filet Mignon, Infused pears, Walnuts and Strawberries over a bed of Spinach.

I give this place 5 starts for atmosphere\/art work, the quick service, and the originality of their food (as well as tastiness We found it just as good as when I had previously tried it in the past, no wonder it has so many good reviews on yelp. Highly recommend that you give it a try.",0,0,0

There was a line of 3-5 people the whole time we were there. Seating is very limited but from the looks of it people did not mind. It was our first time here and did not know what to get. Menu offers you a healthy option and happy option. I ordered the cherry popper and the wife just had a classic. Order was out within 4 minutes. Sweet potato and truffle fries were amazing. Burger was a different taste than normal. The unique combination of flavors blended well together. Overall a great experience. Would definitely come back and try other options. A must try for those looking to eat something they wont have anywhere else.,0,0,0

The only thing that I would change is the menue itself is a little confusing to read for the first timer. I think they should test different layouts and see if it affects sales.

A few things to note:

Current location is small, if you're coming with a group I recommend that someone in the party arrive early to steak out a table. 

Mobile App - They do have a mobile app that you can use to order ahead and miss the lines that can quickly grow.  However viewing the menu in person is a huge treat in of itself. 

Food - The food is very creative, and weekly they have new specials, they are usually posted in a glass holder on the edge of the counter.  Try these out as they may not return!

The staff is so friendly and nice. The restaurant industry should pay the management here for some training.

Love this place!! They have such a good assortment of pretty healthy, pretty quick food. Really yummy breakfast, good snacks, delish salads and much more. I'm especially obsessed with their breakfast items. I do tend to stick to the healthy side, which to be honest doesn't taste TOTALLY healthy but oh well, I'm ok with that. 

As for the service, so great!! Their staff is happy and friendly and competent. Always walk in to a smiling face. 

Tips:

Seating - you have to wait around and stalk ppl who look like they're about to finish and that is perfectly fine, in fact it's the only way you're gonna get a table.

Food - Try the bruleed french toast..yum!! Also they have reallyyy great turkey bacon so I sub that instead of turkey sausage. The slow boat to china is a good little snack too!

They offer delivery and pick up is always super fast.

Great staff, I don't know if it's a hipster thing but all their staff are younger and super positive, seems like the type of place I would love to work at.

Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian.

First, let me say that I am glad they opened a second larger location a few miles away from this one!  While I have enjoyed everything I've ever ordered here, it's just a pain coming to this location.  It's not really conveniently located near anything, the very limited parking is a bit of a nightmare, and there is a perpetual line to order, sometimes so long that it's out the door.  Unfortunately, once you actually do order, the seating is limited to about 8 tables and a bar along the window so you're usually left awkwardly holding your number and hoping someone finishes so you can snag their table before your food comes.  

This trip I ordered the Smoke in a Bowl ($10.00)- Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w\/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt.  This is the first time I have ordered this and I Loved it!  It looks more like Disaster in a bowl, than Smoke, but it tasted like Awesome in a bowl!  All the acidic flavors blended so well together with the yogurt and the large chicken tenderloins were juicy and delicious.  I would definitely order this again.

My friend ordered the Naked Chix add avocado ($7.50, plus $1 for the avocado)- Seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, w\/cilantro yogurt.  I have ordered this before and enjoyed the slightly sweet chicken, but I think my bowl was a far more satisfying option.  She was still hungry when we left.

Some other items I have tried and loved in the past were the CauliFIRE, Chix on Broadway, Cherry Popper Burger, and the Sweet Potato Fries.  All solid options in my opinion.

A note: They used to carry Coke products, and their online menu still reflects that, however, they switched to Boylan products a while back, but their unsweetened Passion Iced Tea is wonderful!",5,2,4

I tried the chix on broadway which is on the happy side... not going to post a pic since there's plenty already. It was a nicely breaded and fried chicken on a brioche bun. I liked the lemon-herb aioli but I would've liked a bit more on the sandwich. 

Sandwiches and burgers come with a side. There is also fresh cold pressed juice available and large cookies. 

I was a newbie and appreciate the friendly and helpful staff upon arrival who made suggestions.

My protein pancakes may have been packed with healthy ingredients but like another reviewer said I was hoping for more health information on the pancakes. Are the protein pancakes on the healthy side because they are high in protein and rich in nutrients? Made with whole grains or oats instead of white flour? The pancakes were tasty but I could barely finish one because they were  dense and heavy. I did not like the turkey bacon because it was too salty and I am not a huge fan of agave syrup in general because I just think it is too sweet. If the pancakes were less sweet it may have worked better but because the pancakes were sweet on their own I could not eat it with the agave syrup.

On my last visit I custom made a 24 oz shake with strawberry, frozen yogurt, kale, and banana. The shake tasted sour but not in a good way. I could not make out the kale and overall it was a sour tasteless banana strawberry smoothie. 

After looking over the menu and tasting a few of the items I am not sold on the healthy side of the menu. I think most of their healthy items lean more towards being fat free, low calorie, and sugar free. Some of their breads and tortillas are listed as wheat which can refer to anything that is wheat and usually has the nutrients removed. None of which are healthy or valuable to the body.",4,2,2

Unusual location but not out of the way.  The eating area is kinda small but comfortable.  Laughed when I hit the restroom and determined the men's room is almost equal in size to the dining area.

The menu is a little confusing but the concept is simply  you got food for health conscious people and food for a fat ass like me.  we ordered:

flat chicken and greens ( $8 ) with a side of fruit ( included in price - not sure why ) 

Chicken and waffles ( $8.50)  - secret, off menu item

Nice to greek you healthy pizza flat bread\/pizza ( 9.50 )

Maine Wedge happy salad ( $4.50 ) 

Highlights - well, basically EVERYTHING !  great value, well prepared and creative.  I can't believe i'm going to write this but I think the prices are on the low side for what you get - the wedge salad ( pic incl ) has large chunks of cheese and bacon with the egg and then you smash on one of the lettuce spears - Mmmmmm - good stuff ! and at $4.50 ??? are you kiddin' me !

The flat chicken and greens has a full chicken breast smashed done and grilled, seasoned perfectly with a bed of greens - the gf was happy.

I guess a slight ding is the chicken and waffles - the chicken need a little more seasoning ( salt ) but overall, we were very happy with the combo.

And heck, I even liked the healthy pizza.

total bill with sodas was $50.

You can either choose the ""happy"" side or the ""healthy"" side to order from and yes it is exactly what it sounds like. A cool thing they do is that they list calorie info for the healthy side but not for the happy side! I'm all for the indulgence.

I got an item off their special iPad menu - the eggs Benedict with a thanksgiving twist. It was a delightful concoction consisting of stuffing waffles, candied cranberries, gravy, turkey and poached eggs. 

My GOD it was heaven. I appreciated the perfect portioning. I was able to get my fix but also finish the whole thing.

The dessert was the best part! My friends and I got two cookies to share - the chocolate chunk and the lemon blueberry. HOT DAMN! They warmed the cookies up and it was like bliss in your mouth.

One star off only for the lack of table space - we had to wait for a bit until a party left before we could get seated.

For the first day, I had their special fried chicken eggs benedict. It was waffle, fried chicken tenders, poached egg, shoestring potato, some delicious house made hollandaise concoction, and syrup. I literally died and went to brunch heaven! I pairs this with a healthy cold press juice that made me feel better about the decadent meal!

For the second day, I tried their s'motherload burrito with a side of truffle fries. Wowsers! You gotta try their housemade ketchup...the Chillpotle and Unipeppercorn are both amazeballs! I came home and immediately ordered some for me to drench myself in the privacy of my own home! I got a fancy smoothie called Charlie Brown, and I just wanted more!

For the third day, I decided on lunch...and had the Spicy Latina (chicken tortilla soup) and the Naked Chix (mango basil chicken over jasmine rice). First and foremost, everything I've ever eaten here has been served piping hot...which is how I like my food, not lukewarm like it's been sitting there...but it tastes like it was hot off the grill! The soup definitely had a kick to it...and it was delicious with so much goodness inside. The Naked Chix was a fantastic rice bowl of healthiness! Perfect lunch!

I can't wait to come back over and over and over again! They're always busy, but the self-serve tables turn quick, and the employees are super duper friendly!

It's really small inside. You order, and then find a place to sit. If there is a place. I sat down, and my husband went up and ordered. We took a menu as we walked in and used that, but there is a board you can order from as well. 

The seating is tight. There is very interesting  music playing overhead. The waitresses were quick to clean the tables and bring our food. We got the free water that tasted like lemon, lime and I swear some jalape√±o. But I could be wrong there. But it tasted spicy. 

The Cluck Moo meat was perfectly done. The avocado was wonderful. However, the egg white was so watery that I had to sop up all of the water off of my plate. My toast was all soggy. Yuk. 
The egg white completely overpowered the meat. You couldn't even see the meat in this dish. Fresh Morning  sandwich was tasty. The spicy jalape√±o ketchup was pretty good, but it overpowered the whole sandwich.

But you can go to a Olive Garden or PF Changs in any town! We wanted local flavor!

Boy, did we find it!

You have to look carefully because this place isn't in a location you'd expect! But look carefully because you don't want to miss it! It's worth the extra effort!

So be prepared: it's small, but there are tables and a bar along the window for seating. You order at the counter then find a place to eat (or have one of your party claim a table early). So it's not a large, sit down and have someone take your order place!

Walking in the door, you are greeted by the friendly staff! They really know how to make you feel welcome! They're enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu suggesting substitutions to fit your tastes or dietary needs.

Then the food came.

Yummoh! I ordered the Vegwich and changed the dressing to the lemon basil aoli. Best sandwich I've ever had in my life! My niece got the Chix on Broadway and it was a BIG sandwich! It was also amazing! The only comment she had was that she couldn't taste the dressing -- would have asked for more! My sister got the Happymess and while it was good, it didn't blend well...more just foods that were put together in a bowl. But all those foods were good!

The fries were BEYOND divine!! Both the regular fries (which were skinny but managed to still be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) and the sweet potato fries. Not enough words in the English language to describe how incredible they are! Best I've had!

So there were a hits and a few misses, but nothing that would ding the quality of the food, the great feel or the awesome staff!!",0,0,0

We came here on a Saturday morning about 45 minutes after they opened. The restaurant was already packed but the line to order was short. The ordering style is pay and the counter, get a number, and they will deliver the food to your table. The only thing is you have to just wait until a table opens up because it's a seat yourself kind of place. We had to stand and drink our coffee for a while but found a table right before our food came.

Since the Chikawaffadopolis (chicken tenders and waffles) had some great reviews I decided to give it a try. It was definitely not what I expected based on the reviews. My waffle was slightly overcooked and I was given a pile of what seemed like leftover scrap pieces of chicken which was supposed to be ""fried chicken tenders."" The so called chicken tenders were dry, flavorless, ovecooked, with slightly burnt edges.  I saw 2 other diners that ordered the same thing get a huge pile of good sized, plump, juicy looking chicken tenders on their waffle. I only ended up eating 1\/4th of the waffle a hardly any chicken. Sooooo disappointing!!  

I usually tend to overlook some of the food quality if the service is good...BUT the service was pretty bad too. The person that took our order was friendly and polite but the server we had was pretty bad. She hardly smiled and tried to rush us out. After bringing more coffee to our table she tried to clear my grandfather's plate and he wasn't even done eating yet. 

I will not be dining here again.",7,1,1

I thought they were being fake pleasant at first, but I apologize for that assumption. They genuinely wanted to serve their customers well.
I had just flown in to Vegas from back east and was pretty hungry by 10:30am local time. As I pulled up I thought my gps sent me to the wrong place because this joint is located in an industrial neighborhood, but it's right on the street and the location worked. 
There were only a few people there and I was able to order right away. I wanted the ahi tacos and ordered a skinny one and a fat one, along with an order of truffle fries I had seen bragged about on yelp.
The skinny one was a grilled ahi and came on a small wheat tortilla served in a small bowl. You had to eat it with a fork at first because it was so loaded. Don't get me wrong, they weren't big tacos, they were about the size of street tacos, but they were stuffed with ahi and veggies and sirachi. The fat taco was fried ahi with a creamy mango salsa served on a tiny taco bowl like the kind you get with a taco salad. 
They were both very different and VERY GOOD! I'd get one of each again if I went there again. Well done! And the truffle fries? Meh.. They were good but not OMG YOU GOTTA GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES good.
I like this place because it has a little bit of everything: breakfast food, burgers, tacos, salads, sandwiches, all with a skinny and a fatty version. Beware though, by the time I left around 11, the place was full and there were about 10 people in line. Yikes! I'd hate to see noon...",0,0,0

Which summed up my sentiments exactly. I don't remember eating anything amazing and the previous experience was a blur. 

The restaurant seems too small for comfort. Definitely not enough seating for 6PM on a Friday. We were lucky enough to get a table because our other friends were holding one while they waited for us to arrive. The girl at the counter was nice, and the food came out pretty quickly. They have sodas from an indie company that's not Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is awesome. That's the only good thing I have to say. 

The truffle fries didn't taste anything like truffle and my friends were wondering where it was on the fries. My chicken sandwich looked like a portobello mushroom and quickly became the joke of the group since my friends thought there was no way a chicken sandwich could be that dark. It was practically burnt to a crisp. Either that or they don't change their frying oil with enough frequency which is gross too. The sandwich tasted really bland and dry. Hardly any aioli and it wasn't until I was more than halfway finished that the slaw\/aioli started to show. 

My friends weren't crazy about their food either, so I'm pretty sure none of us will return. If you're looking for food to hit before the airport, you should go to El Fresco's just on the other side on Paradise for what Vegas voted as the ""Best shrimp tacos",5,2,1

I love that there are two versions of the same type of meal... the healthy versus the happy. I've had the Drunken Monkey Cakes and the Rediculous (Red Velvet waffles), Ahi Srirachi, and Ahi TacoSan.. all of which were DELISH!  Obviously I prefer to be happy versus healthy, but I learned that you could kindda make your own version of both and mix up the happy and healthy. Best of both world, if you will.

It was my second time going to this location, and I prefer it over the Warm Springs location because it is more quaint and not as commercial. It's a cool place to meet friends and chit chat. It is on the smaller side, so large groups would probably not fare well. 

* Just a word of advice... Watch out for the sign. It's easy to miss if you're not paying attention. It's in a business park and unless you're looking, there aren't really any glaring signs like other restaurants.

The potatoes were literally cubed and over-fried pieces, and there were many ""crumbs"" included. Pricing was definitely above where it should be. Next, sampled the pancakes with bananas and chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Yeah, portion here, way too big, and it was diabetes in a plate. This may be opinion, but trying to make it into a meal by adding bacon on the side doesn't bode well.

Sue and I decided to go off strip for our food the first night we were in Vegas, and came across SkinnyFATS via yelp. The reviews were rave and the prices were rad, so we popped over for a few bites. 

We had the:
chicken and waffles (of course) - 3-1\/2 stars
truffle fries ('cause 100 yelpers recommended it) - 1 star
sweet potato fries - 5 stars
shrimp boat (did you say shrimp... boat) - 4-1\/2 stars
tuna tacos - 4 stars

Avoid the truffle fries. Seriously. Unless you want to be disappointed... 'cause it just tastes like regular fries with too much salt. It was so overhyped that we started to call everything we've ever been disappointed in life truffle fries: that terrible anti-climatic arch in the Valley of Fire?

When we left, the line was out the door and a couple were already eyeballing our table to sit.  Beware, this place is not for the cluster-phobic.   This place is small, in an industrial area with only maybe 10 tables and a 12 foot window counter.  They definitely need a bigger place.",0,0,0

I did decide to give it another try. This time I ordered the smoke in a bowl (healthy side) let me start off with the positive side: it was a good portion and I replaced the chicken with shrimp (got 6 jumbo shrimps) and the shrimp was so fresh super high quality which was my favorite part. Negative side: I wouldn't call this plate smoke in a bowl. This isn't what I expected when I ordered this I guess i expected more smokey \/ grilled flavors and ended up having a plate with more of a tomato saucey Italian flavor.

WOWwy wow wow wow.
This place is awesome in more ways than one...and I just had delivery.

THE FOOD - the menu is droolworthy. Whether you're into the whole ""healthy"" thing or you are in dire need of some serious grub (aka ""happy)- the menu has a bunch of options. As soon as I confirmed that this place would deliver to our office, I was super excited to give this place a try. My health-conscious coworker found multiple lunch options that sounded appealing. She settled on the TBLT (turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich) with sweet potato fries. I of course picked a more caloric option and picked the Phatty Philly (hold the blue cheese) and truffle fries. We shared the Rancho-mame snack option (edamame with drizzled with ranch powder and a side of ranch) and we each got a kids-sized shake. I got the Charlie Brown (nutella, bananas, and strawberries-- um yes please) and she got a gross green shake called Adventure Juice. :)
EVERYthing we ordered was great! For food-delivery (I'll talk more more about that later) I was expecting to have a few issues (food cold, shakes melted, blah blah blah) but no. Everything was tasty. My kids-sized shake was the best part and... for only 3 dollars it was a HUGE serving (i'm not great at math but I'm pretty sure I got 16 ounces worth). And it tastes fresh and --just well-made. 
My truffle fries were not piping hot (i mean I get why so no complaints) but they tasted great!! My philly which I had thought was super pricey--- it was HUGE!. it was packed with meat, peppers, and huge portobello pieces. It was tender and just awesome. The edamame was delish too. I may have overordered a tad because I have a lot left over. This was due to the GINORMOUS shake I got that I finished first before eating.... I mean really -- $3 for something that big?!!!! It must be a mistake. My coworker L-O-V-E-D her sandwich. They did not skimp on the turkey bacon and.... it was NOT on your mama's wonderbread... this was thick artisan-type bread. No corners were cut here (no pun intended). 

DELIVERY - Speaking of not cutting corners--- PROPS go out to their online ordering system. It was smart, simple, and easy to use. I'd give it 5 stars just for that. 
The presentation of the food was pretty impressive too. The fry carton was pretty fancy. The container for my edamame is completely reusable and so were the shake cups. I get that they're new and this may change over time but I am still impressed with the quality of their delivery swag.
PLUS, I got the food in 30 minutes.... the ETA email said 20 minutes and I thought - who are they kidding - I expected at least an hour. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived in our lobby just 30 minutes later and he profusely apologized for being ""late"".  I laughed - I told him he was right on schedule! Totally worth the extra $5 delivery fee.

I am SO stuffed! SO happy! and I need a nap. What a great & unique lunch spot (closed on weekends) Impress your co-workers & friends! Do it!",9,5,3

I LOVE THE REUSABLE CUPS!!! Great idea and forward thinking marketing. Next time I use mine it's great advertising for them. 
Since we drove 30 miles to eat here, I was very excited. I had previewed the menu online and read fellow Yelpers reviews before our journey. I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order. My husband ordered the Chix on Broadway and the Caprazy salad. I ordered the slow boat to China and the Chix Flats. 
Slow boat to China was Delicious! The sauces were delicious and the perfect sweet\/salty\/creamy compliment to the fresh cucumber flavor. The Chix Flats was tasty as well. The chicken was juicy and the salad on top was fresh and flavorful. 
My husband was highly impressed with the Chix on Broadway. It was a huge sandwich. He had to cut it in half in order to be able to hold it. I had a piece of the bacon from his sandwich, Thumbs up! The truffle fries were just ok... the balsamic ketchup was the perfect compliment to them. The Caprazy salad was good. Nothing all that different or special about it. 
The service wad excellent. Our food came out quickly and correctly. There was a very nice young man that cleared our plates and asked us about our meal. He was very friendly and we spoke about how far we had traveled. He was sincere in thanking us as we left and invited us to return.

I figured I would eventually try their shop, and it's a little surprising that it took months.

Actually, make that months and a few extra minutes. I wasn't expecting SkinnyFats to be in a commercial area, but something looking more like a strip mall, so I drove right past them. Whoops! I stopped and reconfirmed the address, went back the other way, and luckily turned into the correct parking lot. So yeah,  they're basically inside an office building, and they have this vertical banner on a pole outside that's either green or pink depending on which direction you're approaching from.

Inside, it definitely looked like a place to eat, with some bar style seating (including power and USB charging outlets) and some tables, all done in dark wood or a wood finish. There's to-go menus near the door (useful for when there's a line), and the closest area on the counter has a citrus water dispenser for those of us who don't want to break the bank on the cold pressed juices. The menu boards are visible after you round the corner, and they're bright and clear to read.

I asked Jenn P for her recommendation and followed it exactly: Chix on Broadway ($9.50), and truffle fries as the choice for the side. It was a real treat. Brioche bun was solid, and all the fresh stuff makes it seem vaguely healthy even for something from the ""happy side"" of the menu, but the star of the show was the chicken breast. It's bread and fried to a great golden brown, crunchy exterior that holds up to the juicy and flavorful interior. It helps that there's portions of the chicken that stick out from the bread since you can go back to those and get enough crunch for the entire sandwich.

The truffle fries were pretty good, and I liked the ketchup with jalapeno for a bit of a kick (they're not that spicy, trust me), but I wouldn't say either of those are anything to write home about.

However, I found something else to like in a bite of another friend's Mr. Flapjack ($8.50). It's actually from the healthy side but tastes pretty sweet. The protein pancakes and banana chunks are probably both supplemented with agave nectar so that it's sweet but not actually all that awful. I didn't get a piece of the turkey bacon, but I would consider ordering this in the future for the pancakes and banana alone.

Not everything might be as good as what I ate today, but I was very impressed. I could definitely see myself coming back as long as I don't get lost.",7,4,7

I'm excited to hear that you're adding vegan options. Hopefully gluten free as well? Many folks who want gluten free don't really need a dedicated kitchen but choose not to eat gluten for other reasons (thyroid health, or maybe just because they think it's slimming!) etc. For example, I'd have eaten 10 cookies or bars or healthy desserts if they were vegan and gluten free. I'd pay through the nose for them, too. I want to eat healthfully (not added oils and mostly raw, organic, plant based whole foods) but healthy sweets are something that I love, too.

It wasn't the easiest place to find since their sign is flat and does not stand out. Walking in, there was quite a line (which I'm told is normal), the menus were on the wall near the door for convenience while waiting, and there was cold water to help yourself to. The menu is clever and has unique items, but is a little hard to follow fluently. The prices for entr√©es varied from about $7-$13 roughly. They also had side items and other goodies for less. 

To say the building is small is an understatement. It was cramped and crowded waiting in line, and in the ""larger"" part of the restaurant. You pay for your food and find a table where they bring the order, or you can order to go. We opted to eat there since we had somewhere to be afterward. I saw a table open up (it's first come first serve for seating since it's tiny) so I didn't get to see how the service was at the register. 

I ordered a cheeseburger benedict with no onions and a strawberry lemonade. I was feeling adventurous and fat, so I had to do it. My husband got the more cow bowl with no onions and a strawberry lemonade as well. When we took a drink of the lemonade it was awful. It was almost lukewarm and was watered down. When the server came to drop the food off at the table, we let him know. He sincerely apologized and exchanged both for rootbeer.

The food came and I was impressed with the presentation of it for sure. The burger was big and had cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, avocado, and of course the egg with their sauce on it. The burger was cooked just above medium - well (which I love) and the ingredients were fresh. To my horror the burger still had pieces of red onion throughout. I wasn't sure if it was in the meat itself or just random pieces overlooked. The fries were amazing. My husband's food also had onions (we think onions came from Satan), so I was disappointed to see that. However his bowl was delicious as well (of course I had a bite! It had fried rice AND steak!). 

Regardless of the hiccups, I feel the ambience of the restaurant is pretty cool. Due to its compact size, I was happy to get out of there after eating. We were practically tackled for our table when we got up to go. The food, the menu, and service were all fab so I would recommend this place, and hope to be back soon. Maybe next time I'll order online and pickup though. Hopefully they open another location in Henderson and it will be bigger :)",2,1,1

Seriously though, this place has great food. 

The menu has two sides, healthy and happy, but there is lots of each to find in the other. The healthy dishes are very tasty, and the happy dishes are very flavorful while remaining mostly healthy.

I love tuna, so I found the ahi sirachi to be an amazing mix of flavors, while consisting of healthy ingredients like the vegetable slaw, mango, and a wheat tortilla. The ingredients seem to be of a high quality as well.

I'm mostly a carnivore, but the veggie sandwich even had me drooling. There are several other kinds of dishes I already want to try.

The one drawback is that this place may be too popular, especially given the smallness of the location. Finding seating can be a battle; at peak hours a large group might be hopeless.

The art on the walls is fun and not overdone. Oh and I actually bought one of their shirts and wear it often. Not only to rep the restaurant but mostly to rep the message on the front -- ""live happy.""

It's a little hidden (it's right before the train tracks on Dean Martin if you're facing north), definitely small, but very clean and brightly decorated. When my friend and I entered almost right away we were asked if it was our first time there, and a nice guy behind the counter went over the menu with us. Great service and cleanliness gets an automatic three stars in my book as long as the food is decent. 
The food surpasses decent. A lot of this is because they had exactly what I was craving, exactly how I wanted it. I got their Cheeseburger Benedict (lettuce, tomato, red onion, cheese, avocado, some kind of delicious sauce, and a nice runny egg) which has everything I like on a burger. If I could ""build my own burger"" this is precisely what I want on it. They give you a choice of sides and I got the salad. It's a good size salad with romaine, tomato, and onion served with ranch. Nothing to write home about, mostly because in America you don't write home about a side salad. 
Everything is served on actual plates and metal silverware, which when I wasn't expecting, but it was a nice touch. If I wasn't so adamant about eating a burger, it would have been difficult to choose what to eat. There menu is a decent size and it caters to the fattys (ME) and somewhat to people trying to eat on the healthier side, although I'm not really sure the healthy versions are THAT much better for you. It seems like this place probably gets busy (small and in an industrial part of town), but they have you covered since you can order online.

Ok we were totally lost when we walked in because all that we saw was a line.  Naturally as fine citizens of America, we just stood in line with everyone else. Lol.  Yes, not knowing what it was for.  An employee saw how confused we looked and gave us a little explanation that it was the order line.

So first, it's open seating.  So if you are trying to come with a big group, you are better off dining outside.  May I dare say that it is almost a fire hazard in there?  You can barely squeeze through to use the restroom, or maneuver your way to exit too.
When tables or chairs come free, it becomes snatched up with a quickness.

I say study the menu and know what's on special.  They call it skinny fats because you can choose your evil...healthy vs some extra flavor!  The menu was a bit different because it's bunched differently then what you are normally used to.  The division of sandwiches, salads, etc. yah it's not like that.  well as I finally came around to see the board menu above, it was easier to read.  However, I was instantly distracted when I saw the eggs Benny special they had.  It was poached eggs on steak sitting on cornbread.  I think the cornbread just seriously set it off.  The flavors were sooo good.   We ordered truffle fries as a side and that just complimented it.  Ok I lied, not complimented it, we just like variety.

The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.

So as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1\/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.

The truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon.",2,1,1

Very random location. In a very secluded industrialized commercial center off of the 15 freeway between russell and tropicana. In ny opinion, the location is the only thing keeping this business from its potential. However, the unusual location does not give me reason to subtract stars.

We chose the place based on yelp reviews since we are on vacation & didn't want buffet food.  Warning don't go off the yelp pictures...some of the items are not available like the red velvet waffles.  You walk in & place your order at the counter.  Sit wherever you like or I should say where available.  We actually had to wait for a table to get up to have a seat.  I say down for maybe 2 minutes & a lady asked if I could move to a smaller table so her party of 8 could sit.  I agreed but I must say I was a bit annoyed.  I had already waited just to have a seat in the first place.  On top of that, we finished our entire meal before the so called party of 8 even ordered food (never saw 8 people arrive) - rude.   

As for the food.  I like the option of healthy or happy...can't healthy be happy?  I got the protein waffles with berries from the healthy side.  It was good.  The juices sounded good too but they cost almost as much as a meal so I passed.  I would probably come back but order to go.",1,0,0

I really dig the fact that SkinnyFATS can cater to my inner fatty or the more health conscious side of me. This unique concept is one reason this place should be a must-go when in Vegas.

The interior is pretty cool, but I think it's way too small for the amount of people who come in here and eat. Seats and tables are super limited, so good luck finding a table if your group is a party of 4+. Luckily, it wasn't terribly crowded when we came in.

The food is pretty amazing here. The nice lady taking my order talked me in to getting something off of their secret menu (the ""secret"" menu items are displayed on the iPads in front of the register).

I got the Filet of Fire, which is a steak sandwich with avocado and fried jalape√±os between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread. I was a bit skeptical about it at first because I'm not really an avocado-in-my-sandwich type of guy, but the picture of the sandwich looked so appetizing I just had to try it out!I liked the fact that they left some pink in the steak because I hate it when steak is overcooked. The sandwich had a savory flavor and all the ingredients complemented each other. 

The fries were crispy and they taste even better if you dip it in their Sriracha aioli. The Sriracha aioli was rich & creamy, but I definitely was expecting more of the actual Sriracha flavor in it... Still pretty bomb, though!

I ordered the Ahi Tacos, which came with 3, and it was pretty good. HOWEVER....if you're not a big fan of eating raw stuff or the TEXTURE of it, considered yourself warning. 
Don't get me wrong, these tacos were DELICIOUS....but I can only handle so much raw texture in my mouth =\/ After one and a half tacos, the slimy feeling became too much for me to handle. I'm not big on sushi anyways so this was like going out of my element. I was still able to finish all three of my tacos though so that's really saying how delicious they were.

The flatbread just wasn't good and not worth it at $8, $2\/slice. The truffle fries were ok, but can you really mess up fries and adding truffle oil? The total of our bill was $24. Overall, I know I can find really great food (healthy or not) for $24 for two people somewhere else.",12,1,4

Most of their dishes are better when consumed immediately (the no soggy zones in life are slight glimpses of the promised land).  This is definitely not a place for group outings, and although high chairs are offered for the babies (looking out for those new parents), it's not the ideal setting for them.  I recommend driving out to the Warm Springs location because it offers more space.

Now let's get into the food!  The dishes have always been a hit or miss.  Some keep me coming back, while others are a one time experience.

The Yasssss:

$10 Chix on Broadway (Happy): Breaded chicken tenders cooked to a crisp thrown in some brioche and topped with cheddar (mo chedda mo betta), red onion (make it grilled), BLT and lemon herb aioli!  

$3.50 Ahi Srirachi (Healthy): seared ahi thrown into a wheat soft taco and topped with mango pico de gallo and spicy yo-aioli.  3 of these bad boys make the perfect meal!  Great mixture or sweetness and spice!  

$7 Buff Chix (Happy): breaded chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce.  The tenders are served over truffle fries.  It's hard to go wrong with tenders.  The chicken was still nice and juicy after being breaded and fried, but not enough sauce was provided.  Upon request, I was provided more sauce.  The fries are very thin and nicely seasoned!  I vote yes!

$10 Wrap Supastar (Healthy): grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, pico de gallo and egg whites wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla!  The wrapped burrito is drizzled with Cajun cilantro lime yogurt and some more pico is thrown on top.  The ingredients say breakfast, but this hits the spot any hour!  Everything harmonizes well together!  

The Pass:

$12 Chick A-Waff-A-Polis (Happy): the waffle is a nice size, but is very dry.  It's on the thicker size, so one would expect differently.  The batter leaves much to be desired.  The fried chicken was dry and therefore lacked taste.  A side of syrup was the only accompaniment.  I recommend going elsewhere for this dish.  

$11 REDiculous: the red velvet waffle lacked flavor.  This waffle was extremely similar in taste to the regular waffle sold and leaves one to assume that food coloring was the main addition to the batter.  The waffle was dry and left much to be desired.  The cream cheese frosting and chocolate syrup complimented the raspberries, strawberries and blackberries that were use as toppings!  The berries are large in size and in all honestly the stars of the dish, followed by the applewood bacon.  The waffle should be the main star of the dish for the listed price, so I vote pass!

I do have to compliment the restaurant on its customer service.  The entire staff was very friendly and attentive.  This little place can make for a very pleasant experience if the right dish is ordered so I recommend trying it if you're in the area!",2,0,1

There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the ""Cranburkey"" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the ""happy side"" of the menu.  She ordered the ""Chix on Broadway"".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large ""Mr Green"" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.",33,15,18

When it is busy (which it always seems like it is) if you were to walk in you'd kinda want to change your mind just because of the space. It's very small so if you plan coming here with a group you should come before they open. It's an open seating type restaurant where you order in the front then you sit at your table and wait.

Now let's talk about the food..

#Happymess (4\/5) basically truffle French fries with steak,Pico de gallo, gorgonzola cheese crumbles. Really good actually I would definitely order it again.I would only recommend it had like a sauce smothered on it or some sour cream. Would probably make it better

#merica (3\/5)-is what I personally ordered. I'm a big fan of chicken fried steak and eggs and their version had biscuits instead of toast and what is really missing from this dish is flavor in the gravy and the biscuits weren't that great plus when I'm eating this I love some hashbrowns or country potatoes which it didn't have.

# REDiculous (4\/5)-red velvet waffles!!I really like how this dish was put together all the flavors were there and everything but the bacon needs some work 

# Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (5\/5)I think this was my  favorite dish very simple and just finger licking good..you can't really go wrong with chicken and waffles unless your waffle is messed up or your chicken is lacking but both paired up well together.I would also order this again

Overall I would definitely be back to try other things but I would hope that they could add some more things to the menu because it seems very limited and I think it would be better if they had more of a variety for breakfast.",0,0,0

Although their space is tiny for the amount of people that love their food, the ambience is very laid back, and the staff is on their game. They handle the crowd well and with a positive attitudes.
Now, about the food, any place that has jalepeno ketchup on their tables is my kind of restaurant!!! You can't beat the freshness of their entree items. We ate the Cranburkey with truffle fries and the Tu-Nuts. Both dishes were so delicious, had fresh, very fresh produce and satisfied without needing to have someone roll me out of the restaurant.

I had no problem locating the restaurant because I know how to get to Larry Flynt's and I know it's on the same street (you can learn valuable information at bachelor parties occasionally).

There were only two tables in the restaurant at the time which allowed a very friendly staff member the opportunity to explain the menu to us and offer some recommendations. We took our seats, food was delivered to our table, and we were checked on regularly by the staff. Overall, we were happy with the service and timeliness of our meal. We were in and out right around 30 minutes. 

My wife had the Nice to Greek You and I ordered the Cherry popper. My wife enjoyed her flatbread with chicken, cucumber, tomato, red onion, olives and tzaziki. A pretty traditional combination but executed well. The human trash compactor in me usually has to finish off most of my wife's meals, but she finished the job on this one. My burger was a little messy, but expected with the egg and slaw, with a nice a little kick of heat. And I don't know too many people who don't like Hawaiian bread.

With a strong first impression, we will be back for sure anxious to try more of the menu probably more from Everything Else Happy side for me.",0,0,1

First off, if you don't know about this location's whereabouts, you'll miss it if you're not paying attention. Which almost adds to the lore of the place!! Wizardry at work here people. SkinnyFats knows exactly what they're doing. Small dining room, just big enough for the amount of people that can find, or know about, their spot. Super wavy decor. On point. 

Secondly, it's smart to opt for the secret menu for creativeness, i.e. ""Balls 2.0"". Wow. Just wow. Deep fried corn and risotto balls, in a creamy sauce of epic proportions, with micro greens and a plethora of flavor happiness!! Every time. 

Now for the rest:

Kids food is so fun here. ""Clucky Toes""= chicken fingers + side of choice. ""Nutty Banany""= peanut butter and banana on multigrain toast. Yum! 

""Cranburky""= a cranberry and turkey party, with sage and some festive seasonings on a whole wheat bun with lettuce and tomato. ""Naked Chix""= grilled chicken breast in an awesome mango salsa sauce atop brown rice with cilantro-yo!! Light yet flavorful. Truffle fries are always a must. Crisp and savory. The cream soda is the best around. 

Really nothing bad can be said about the food!! Delicioso!",3,1,2

Skinny being food that is light in calories and fat, while Fats will leave a smile on your face (and you may perhaps have to undo the to button of your pants up before leaving). 

Since this was my maiden voyage to SkinnyFats, I decided to satiate the devil and the angel. I ordered a Skinny Snack (Ahi Sirachi) and a Skinny Salad (Cobb Me Maybe) and I decided to suck it down with the Charlie Brownin' Shake on the Fat side.

Walking in, you look over the the menu, and I had a very sweet girl explain everything to me: the concept, her favorites, and told me the specials of the day (pro-tip: specials change daily, check Facebook). She also offered me a free sample of their strawberry lemonade (so good). The place has a modern rustic feel and accents of bright, natural colors. There are even fun pictures of fruits, veggies, animals, happy faces painted on the walls. You place your order, then take a seat, and the bring your food and drink to you. The dining room is rather small, so I do not recommend this place for more than groups of 4. 

I placed my order, grabbed a seat, and some water, and then my parade of delicious came along. First the Ahi Sirachi. This was amazing. It was light and bursting with flavor. I highly recommend. The Cobb Me Maybe salad was okay. The ingredients were great, but for whatever reason, the dressing was just off... some things aren't meant to be light. The ingredients were fresh and tasty.My shake was heavenly: vanilla ice cream with NUTELLA (the nectar of the Gods), banana, and strawberry blended it. (This shake was on the kids menu, but upgraded to a 16 oz. size). It satiated the devil on my shoulder nicely.

SkinnyFats is a solid place. They also have an assortment of juices, baked items, burgers, salads, soups, snacks, shakes, and breakfast that is served all day and that I am dying to try. I highly recommend giving this place a try. It wasn't 5 star awesome, but it sure does try.",2,0,1

First time I went here, I was excited to try this place out and their healthy side of the menu but ended up ordering a burger and fries because that's what my tummy was craving. 

It was onolicious and satisfied my burger cravings. The burger was huge, thick and juicy and better than most burger restaurants that specialize in $10+ burgers.

all of those statements truly explains the name of what Skinny Fat means. Left side of the menu is all the healthy stuff and right side is all of the unhealthy items. it has everything your heart can desire. the good and the bad. 

Ordered:
Filet o fire- comes w a side - truffle fries - it was the right about of spiciness. the steak was not chewy. roasted jalape√±os. right about of kick. truffle fries was on point! 
Meltdown- comes w a side - sweet potato fries. the whole thing was super soft! loved the flavors and taste. sweet potato fries were also on point!
Chicken tenders -kids menu comes with a side. - fresh fruit. my little one ate the whole thing! 

Staff are really nice. Seats are first come first served. which kinda sucked because the place is small and you're like trying to hunt people down when they are done. or you give them the evil eye like fool, you're done eating hurry up and leave! food comes out at a very reasonable time. my little family would definitely come back the next time we are in town. we really enjoyed our food and the variety that they had. definitely no complaints as everything tasted so good on the evil\/unhealthy side of things. i'm sure the healthy side tastes just as good. lol

During the visit, we ordered a few items including...

The Happy Mess - it's a bowl filled with truffle flavored fries, thin strips of steak and topped with tomato salsa and LOTS of blue cheese. The fries and steak themselves are really good with the ketchup. I don't think the cheese and salsa go well with fries but that's just me. Next time I think I will stick with the plain truffle fries instead.

More Cow Bowl - a rice bowl filled with teriyaki beef, pineapple sauce and vegetables. They used too much sauce which made the whole plate super sweet and heavy. We hated this item.

Ahi Tacos - I didn't try this item but my sister said it was okay. Not great, not horrible.

Edamame with chili garlic glaze - The edamame was drenched in a sweet glaze. I think I prefer regular edamame with sea salt better.

Over all - I'd come back here for fries but I'm not too crazy about the items we ordered.

On a side note, they have fresh squeezed juice here and they're ~$9-10 per drink. That's pretty pricey!",10,1,5

Decided on this place for dinner as I was looking for a healthy alternative to the many calorie packed menus on the Las Vegas strip. It's about a 10-14$ ride from most hotels on the strip.

The restaurant is on the smaller side; it has about 6 tables (Variety of 2\/4 seaters). It also has one long table with 9 high chairs. You order and pay first then get your food brought out to you after taking a number.

As the name suggest; the left side of the menu is Healthy and the right side isn't :). For every regular dish; there's the same dish with a healthy twist on the left side. I ordered the Ahi-Tuna taco and the ""Cherry Popper"". Might I add very good way to pop your SkinnyFATS cherry :P. Burger was cooked to perfection; love when a restaurant throws an egg in a burger to bring it all together. 

We went at 7PM on a Wednesday but it picked right up around 8 and many people didn't find seats. It's a small place but it's worth waiting around for a table to free up or taking it to go. The food is phenomenal and for the price you really can't beat it. To put the cherry on top; Kathryn A (working the register that's what the slip says :P) made my first experience great.

As far as the regular menu goes it is creative, well done, and most likely inspired by some pot smoking. 

The idea of choosing skinny or the fat side of  menu is a great edge to this spot and you can't go wrong whichever way you go. Also the employees here are great to, nothing but smiles from all of them!

All in all I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Yes it gets crowded and yes seating can be a pain and yes it's a bit off the beaten path. But it is worth putting up with these three issues, good food at goo prices are hard to come by these days.",1,2,1

Little tip: read the menu before going so that you have a small idea of what you will be interested in when you arrive. I looked the menu up before my lunch and it helped a lot.

The location is in a very odd industrial area that many people would overlook if they did not know this great restaurant existed here.  The space itself is very tiny and has seating for 40 people tops so it always feels busy inside. 

The menu has a Jekyll and Hyde feel to because you have some items that appear very healthy and some that appear gluttonous.  No worries I will pick the latter every time.  

I selected the ""Chix on Broadway"" with Truffle Fries.  This crispy fried chicken breast sandwich was a great portion.  I had to ask for some more lemon aioli to slather on but the crispy lettuce, tomato and bacon were the perfect topping trifecta.  My fires were a little under done but were still delicious.  

The ""Unbrierevable"" was another item selected that did not disappoint the taste buds.  The combination of strawberries, chocolate sauce, tender melted brie cheese and a crispy waffle were amazing.  The french inspired dish of gluttony definitely satisfied the taste buds. 

The one downfall about the location is the size.  I am sure that is why the Warm Spring's location is triple the size and has an outdoor patio.  We will be back when we are in the neighborhood.",1,0,1

The first visit had me reeling at how delicious the food is. The Smoke in a Bowl is one of my favorites. The mixture of sweetness from the agave BBQ chicken mixed with the savory components made it well balanced. The second time; I got the Slow Boat to China and the aPollo fries. It is a generous portion of both. The hollowed out half cucumber topped with chicken salad and a mixture of sauces was excellent. The sweet potato fries topped with a mixture of sweet and savory. It was odd at first to remember that there are olives, cranberries, chicken, feta, and arugula topped with a balsamic reduction. It worked well together. The breakfast fell into the same catergory. Satisfactory for the most part. I had a few bites of the Creme Brulee french toast and enjoyed it without the maple syrup. The beet salad is nothing special and was the biggest disappointment.

We've watched enough food documentaries on Netflix to scare the s- out of us making it hard to stomach sugar, salt, GMOs, and a everything else that is said to give us cancer. It just doesn't taste right anymore. What can I say? Fear does something to your taste buds.

So out of desperation we paid over $10 for a cab to take us three miles to SkinnyFats. And the cab driver questioned us. He pulled up to a nondescript strip on the side of the highway. It looked like a row of offices - maybe even call centers. He was like, ""Are you sure this is it?"" He even went in with us and took a menu to make sure it was a legit restaurant! On our second trip (because we sure went back) the cab driver gave us his cell number so that we could have a ride back. No taxis were going by that joint. SkinnyFATS was for locals with cars and not tourists like us.

Both times we went we got freshly pressed juice in reusable cups. YUM. It was like home and we loved it after the sodium-saturated, MSG ridden stuff we'd been suckered into eating with our friends.

The food was scrumptious. The menu is divided into two sections. First, the skinny. That's all about healthy food. The other part is the fat which isn't quite as healthy. So, you can have chicken and waffles with a grilled chicken breast or chicken and waffles with fried chicken. Get it? Brilliant.

Heck! We loved SkinnyFATS so much that plan to incorporate it into our next trip. We're going to the Grand Canyon and have to fly into Vegas.

I have been going to this location for well over a year. Almost every day I buy my crew lunch, and for a long time this was one of our preferred places to go. Because they are good, and we were not the only ones who thought so. Every month they would be busier, and busier. Not a bad problem to have. But unfortunately, in that process they do not seem to be able to keep up with what is happening in house. After several unpleasant to go order experiences - Orders with wrong, items missing, having to wait a REALLY long time we decided to give them some time to get a handle on this level of success.

Yesterday, for the first time in months we decided to try SkinnyFats again. At 11:10AM placed an order for 6 items and we were told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I was skeptical of that timeline, as it has not been my experience but I went in after 30 minutes hoping the food would be ready. I was wrong. at 12PM I asked one of the stressed out servers when my order would be ready. She seemed so irritated that I would even ask. How dare i???

She let out a huge annoyed sigh, then looked out into the dining room and said ""we are really busy"" and walked away with such hostility. I was actually taken aback. I FINALLY got my order at 12:15PM. Over an hour after I had placed it, and with not even an apology. 

Even after months of hoping they could figure out how to adapt to the level of business, this place is still total chaos at lunch time!

We ordered a green smoothie and breakfast burrito. Now, I know a green smoothie is a big of a gamble...but, it tasted horrible - mostly like grass clippings.

Seriously...I really do appreciate the 'healthy' side of the menu - all with their multigrain protein waffles, egg white omelette with avocado toast - blah, blah, blah...OOPS, looks like the devil took over!

For this day we stayed with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Come on, it was a weekend!  We just got done mall hoppin'!  We were hungry!  So we decided to carpe diem, go for the gusto!

Actually, this technically was a 'snack' for us LOL - we were past the lunch rush, but it was way too early for dinner.  So this kinda like, lunner?  Uh, linner?  Anyway, somewhere in between.

We ended up gettin' down & dirty with:

-Chicka Wafa Dopolis - Fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffle w\/syrup & powdered sugar

-Red Velvet Waffle w\/Applewood Bacon (special) - Red Velvet waffle with berries, cream cheese frosting w\/syrup and a side of applewood smoked bacon

Whoa!  Tasty crazy!  Yes, this is what you get with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Balls-to-the-walls calories!  It drives me kinda nuts when they post the calorie count of things now-a-days (thanks California), but thankfully SkinnyFATS only does is for the 'healthy' side of the menu.  My guess...the 'happy' side is drowning in excess!

I really liked their take on chicken & waffles.  The tenders were moist, crunchy, battered just right.  Sticky sweet with syrup poured all on top!  Their waffle was good as well - not dry, airy & light.  Such great textures!

Red Velvet isn't really my thing but the fam enjoyed this dish as well.  They really liked the waffle, it had good Red Velvet taste, was sweet, and the waffle itself lent a nice crunch.  Applewood bacon, how do you screw that up??

My only complaint about SkinnyFATS is that while the place is hip & happenin', it is SMALL.  Did I just go all caps on that?  I can only imagine on a super busy day they are totally packed, with a line going out the door.  Service was great, with our 1st time there our person was knowledgeable in any questions we had.

SkinnyFATS is not really near my part of town where I live, so as much as I would like to go back, it might be a while.  Perhaps I may try their Warm Springs location instead, that one is a bit closer to me.  Overall though, food is great!  I like the theme, devil or angel?  Good or bad?  Naughty or nice?  At SkinnyFATS the choice is yours!

To be noted, I'm often a pretty bad boy...heh heh heh.

I was really happy to think there was a Healthy Restaurant here that was hip and fun but what I thought about this place does not represent what any of you went through.  The place is Crowded and smells Funny.  I ordered the Ahi Tacos and you can use some salt, Use sea salt for God's Sake.  It's Healthy and good for you.  Those were the driest nastiest fish tacos I have eaten in my life and I am very well traveled.  If you think no flavor means healthy you would be incorrect.  

My Boyfriend got their french fries so I tried a couple DISGUSTING they are drowned in a low grade Truffle oil and taste HORRIBLE! 

The Sweet Potato fries were just ok.  They do not use any Fruits or Vegetables in Season, so they do not seem to know much about what they are doing.  The food cooked there is MEDIOCRE AT BEST!  Why this place gets crowded is BEYOND BELIEF! 

Tell the cooks to learn how to cook out of passion and not out of routine. And put some nutritional Facts up about your food.  I want to know what I ingest and how much work I need to do later.

From the restaurant space to the server ware, there is a meticulous attention to detail that achieves the perfect balance of trying (but not too hard) to please you.  The restaurant space is tiny, so be prepared to wait during rush hours, but what they did to that cookie cutter commercial place, and the menu, and little things like the salt and pepper man turns my heart into a fuzzy kaleidoscope hippie.  

Flaxseed Fans or Rebels can choose items from either their ""Skinny"" menu or their ""Happy"" menu (I'm really pleased they didn't call that Fat.  We are not fat.  We are big boned and Happy, thank you very much).  These are your typical diner menu items served with a modern twist, alongside fancy, healthy fusion grub.  There's something to please everyone.  Hubby had the Eggs Benedict burger which he was happy with.  Lil man had the Buf Chix (sauce on the side) and a fruit bowl which was pretty standard.  And I had the Cobb Salad because I was nursing a hangover.  Good stuff.  Totally can relate to the sad face on the happy meter when our root beer floats were almost empty.  

Service at the counter was pretty slow (dunno if the crew is new), but they were extremely accommodating.  Re-did my son's order when I expressed that I wish the sauce was on the side.

For starters, it's small. Even when it's not busy, it's not hard to feel claustrophobic. They're usually quick to turn over the tables, but people are also quick to snatch them up. Last time I was here I sat at the bar type seating by the window. Although the weather was nice that day, I can't imagine sitting there during a summer day when the sun is blazing. The other downside to the small space is that it's so, so noisy. I was sitting right next to my fiance and I had to shout for him to hear me. Also, sitting at the bar area when it's busy sucks, because the line forms right behind you. It's really unpleasant having people breathing behind you while you're trying to eat. 

I always seem to have trouble with my food here, too. The first time I came here I got a chicken based meal and a side of rice. The chicken was good, but the rice was cold when it came out. The second time I came here I got a burger, and my burger was cold. Then, this time when I came, I ordered pancakes and they were cold! I'm not sure if my food is easy to make and it sits around while the other food is made, but that was the final straw for me, unfortunately.

I went here with Michael P. & Jessica R. for dinner last night and ordered the Cobb me maybe & an ahi sirachi taco. 

Michael ordered the neato burrito & Jessica ordered the Chix on Broadway + truffle fries.

After picking off the black beans, I dug into my salad. If I get it again, I'm going for the happy side Cobb because I wasn't feeling the dressing. On the plus side, there were a ton of toppings and it was a good value.

I have a thing about tortillas - I don't like flour tortillas unless they're cooked until crisp like a quesadilla or chimichanga. I think flour tortillas have a gummy, floury taste that I just can't stand. Unfortunately, the tacos here are served on flour rather than corn. Personal preference, but this would have been a killer taco on corn, but the tortilla was overpowering that it really masked all the flavors of the tacos.

Jessica and Michael split their meals with each other and they said the burrito looked great but was chewy and disappointing. Apparently the meat needed chopped up some to be manageable. The Chix sandwich looked incredible and apparently it was great. I tried some of the fries and found them to be... Dry? Can a fry be dry? I wish I would have tried the ketchups.

Then the menu, with a very unique layout, can make you sit there reading it over and over again, painstakingly trying not to order everything on the menu.

It's also super apparent that they don't have enough floor space here. You have to line up to order your food at the front counter, with no guarantee of finding a seat...the chances of which aren't very good since this place is packed during most of its hours of operation. I can't imagine why they have such a small place, as they could do exponentially better by providing more seating for their patrons.

My recommendations: the sweet potato fries are to die for. Remember to get a SkinnyFats soda cup, since you can get cheaper refills when you bring it back on a future visit. Any sort of fish taco here is also amazing.",0,0,2

I've had most of their foods here, but for this review I had the cherry burger. This burger is just to die for. You can get the meat cooked to your preference and it's topped off with veggies and a  coleslaw topping. They also throw in a fried egg to bring everything togetjer. 

The only reason this review does not get 5 stars is because the location is very inconvenient and hard to find at times! Also the place is very limited in space so you might find your self vulcherjng for open tables against other people on busy hours!

I am usually a creature of habit when it comes to certain things, take an item on a menu that I fall in love with. When I try to venture out and get something different, I usually kick myself for doing so. Case in point, my experience here. I started following them on Instagram awhile back, and the food pornography they put on is off the charts! I had to try the Slow Boat to China, Asian chicken salad, slaw chee in a cucumber boat w\/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aoili. This quickly became my favorite menu item. To really confuse my taste buds, I shared the Drunken Monkey Pancakes, buttermilk pancakes, maple glazed bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate w\/applewood bacon. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this was too much, even for me. One bite was enough.  Ok, go ahead and throw in an order of your famous truffle fries. Now that's what I'm talking about. Those were really good, as well as the sweet potato fries. 

The next couple times, I'd tried to stick to the ""healthy"" side of the menu, I tried the Cranburkey SF turkey burger, arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry basil yogurt on a honey wheat bun w\/side. It was really plain and boring, even with the cranberry basil and onion, I ended up putting the slaw chee on it to give it some flavor. 

Last time I was there I ordered the special of the day which was Chicken & Waffle Chowder. Exactly as it sounds, it was really gross. 

But what has really left a sour taste in my mouth was my experience with the delivery service. I decided to order online for delivery, I order my food, check out, and it gives me a total. Well about 20 minutes later I hear my email alert go off on my phone, so I check my email, and it is a confirmation of my order, but with a $10 fee added for delivery. No where on the online ordering does this state this fee, and it was not what I agreed to when I ""checked out"" online. I called immediately to cancel my order (I live 7 miles from SkinnyFats, I wasn't about to pay that) but I'm told it's too late to cancel, so I tell him that I will pick my order up. So I write a ""tip"" on the page alerting others of the delivery fee that is not stated, and I get an email from Charity pretty much pressuring me to remove the tip, which I relunctantly did, and I wish I hadn't.",13,3,6

Food: they have. Avery unique me I, but we weren't super hungry. So, we decided to shared an order of Truffle Fries (3.5\/5) that were hot and tasty. However, sometimes, I think places try to hard adding stuff, when hot fresh fries with salt are truly the best.

Went to skinny fats for lunch today with some friends and we ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share.  I love the concept of this restaurant that separates healthy vs. happy (aka fatty) items on the menu.  They also have lots of juices and salads for the health conscious.  We ordered 3 things from the unhealthy menu and 1 item from the healthy side.  We got truffle fries, smotherload breakfast burritos, sirracha ahi tuna tacos (healthy) and the stewy Benedict.

The good:
Fries were yummy.  It goes well with the jalape√±o ketchup.  The portion size is very generous.

Breakfast burrito - it had steak, sausage, peppers, potatoes and salsa on top.  It also has a delicious sauce that goes on top of the burrito.  It was very flavorful.  Again portion size is huge.  

The ahi tacos are individual orders.  We got 3 for 3 people to share.  It comes on a whole wheat tortilla.  When i first bit into it, I can tell that the fish is not that fresh.  But all the salsa, sauce, onions and mango masked the taste.  I guess youre supposed to eat it all together and not just taste the fish itself.

The bad:
I didn't really like the stewy benedict.  It was a huge biscuit with an egg on top, hence the benedict, and its smothered in a beef stew.  It was a little salty for me and there wasn't that much meat either.

Next time I come back I defintiely want to try more of their healthy options...especially the juices and not succumb to the bad influences of friends who wants to eat everything off the ""happy\/fatty"" menu.",1,1,1

Yup, they've definitely made a fan out of me. A loyal one at that too! I love the variety that's entailed in their name. You can indulge in their ""Happy"" menu or opt for a ""Healthy"" item. There's literally something for everyone.

I try to stick to their ""Healthy"" menu, although I must say that some of their ""Healthy"" items aren't the best for clean-eating. They do, however, offer a healthier choice which is good enough for me! I love their Chickhumm, a multi-grain bun filled with grilled chicken breast, sprouts, tomato, onion & hummus. I always complete the meal by adding a side of truffle fries.

The STEAKation is super tasty as well. It reminds me of a healthy spin on a Philly cheesesteak, except it's made with shaved New York steak, arugula, tomato, onion, and horseradish yogurt on a mutli-grain bun. You can also ask for your burger on a whole wheat hoagie instead! The onions tend to be overbearing so I order it without them. The horseradish yogurt, however, is light yet flavorful.

Asides from their delicious food, their superb service always keeps me coming back. I've never met such a happy, bubbly crew of employees! They take service with a smile to a whole new level. It makes me feel so guilty not tipping when I order to-go here. And who tips on to-go orders?!

I also got the TBLT which was good, but again, it's turkey bacon and will never rise up to its porcine competition (if you can call that competition...).

I (partly) can't get behind the concept because I don't know how they break down and define the skinny portion of the menu versus the fat side.  

Is it skinny because its low calorie?... well it doesn't seem to be very healthy.  Most of the food seems loaded with sugars and fat free ingredients.  Which isn't my idea of healthy nor skinny.  However, if you compare the skinny to the fat side, you may be doing a little better but I still can't be sure without more information on the menu. 

The menu is confusing already, so it would be great if they simplified it and added some more information or details about what you're eating.  (i.e. Organic, No GMO's, Fat free, Low Calorie)

Also, I didn't feel that the flavors were well developed.  They seem either too salty or too packed with sugar.  This was my biggest issue.  I've been about 3 times and I've been disappointed each time.  

I think this place has great potential and would love for it to improve, but I can't give it my recommendation.  

Interior is cute, staff seemed nice, wait time wasn't too bad, I like the self seating, but its a very confusing menu and concept that I can't agree with.... However, I hope I'm wrong. I hope that skinny means healthy with quality ingredients (Organic, low salt, NO GMO's, etc. ) and not just low calorie with lots of salt and sugar or a fat free salad dressing versus a regular salad dressing.",8,2,4

They are in a business type complex so it's a little bit of a weird spot but their sign is easy to see and they have an a-frame out on the curb too. 

While the menu is a little confusing at first, there's two sides to it and I'm sure it's already mentioned but here's the rundown. The left side is the skinny\/healthy side and the right is the fat\/happy side. Each dish is featured on both sides of the menu but done in a different way to fit the theme. I thought that was awesome!

As far as food goes, it is killer! I had the chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (chicken & waffles) which is a ""secret menu"" item and my wife had the wedge salad, we also shared a side of Hot-Mame (edamame). All of it was great, super flavorful and they definitely aren't skimpy with their portions. The wedge salad is huge and ingredients were fresh. My one and only complaint was the chicken was slightly overcooked...but the flavor definitely made up for it. They also have a good selection of juices, smoothies and such but we opted for a passion tea which was really good.

You want to eat healthier? You want options? You juice at home, but you're not at home right now...... and you don't do McDonalds, and maybe you want a burger?  SkinnyFats may be your best bet in Las Vegas. The greater challenge however, may be ""finding their lease space!"" They're in a commercial center, on the service road (Dean Martin Dr.) just West of the 15, just North of the 215. I drove to the address, but even in front of their entrance, didn't realize I had arrived. The face of their space is flat, and can be missed if you're looking for a multi-dimensional entrance... there are graphics, but the face of their space, facing the freeway, is flat. (sorta' like the Mr. Green drink I got!?) On my way out of town from a business trip, I found myself craving a green juice. So I walk in and saddle up to the counter. The interior is very ""rustic-contemporary."" I liked it.

I didn't order any food, although their menu did look interesting. I ended up ordering the Mr. Green, cold pressed juice. It's a $9.50, 20 ounce serving. But be aware... they have two cups sitting above the counter, and I was asked if I wanted the ""large"" or ""small."" What I didn't know is that the large isn't the $9.50 serving. That's actually the smaller cup. The larger cup will be about $2.50 more... although the menu board doesn't have that info., (a glitch that bothered me), and my counter person didn't explain. I got the smaller cup for $9.50. 

BTW...... there's another ""healthy eating cafe"" in Henderson, called Protein House. I went there the night before, and had a respectable turkey burger (protein style wrapped in lettuce), and a steamed veggie bowl, (my pick of veggies.) The concept is great, but in both spaces I felt that the ""order at the counter"" process could be improved. In the specialty food retailing business, well trained, highly competent and personable staff separate the true high-volume winners over the ""wanna-be's."" And from friends who own specialty retailing businesses, they've shared that their ""face out front"", makes all the difference in their sales volume and overall success. It's the counter person that, if well trained, can coach a client from ""just a beverage"", to ""Entree or App PLUS a beverage."" Just sayin' is all......",9,7,9

However, the options for people with different diet restrictions is quite impressive. There are great GF and Veggie-friendly options, which makes group gatherings easy :)

It is oddly located in some weird industrial complex facing the freeway, so ambiance is definitely missing. But the decor inside is hip and comfy. It's kinda small and can get kinda crowded.

Their menu consist of the 'healthy side' for me who was craving one ""healthy"" meal while on vacation, and the 'happy side' for my hubby who loves all things fried, greasy and delightful. 

All cravings are welcomed. You can crave steak, scrambled eggs, meatballs, chia pudding, and whatever, and they prepare those items both ways, the 'healthy way' and the 'happy way'. 

We tried a breakfast bowl with scrambled egg whites, turkey sausage and a variety of vegetables (healthy side). It was light, fresh and hardy. They also serve the breakfast menu all day which is nice since it was noon but I wanted a breakfast item. 

We also tried the 'Chix on Broadway' and 'Pimp Shrimp' (happy side). The 'Chix on Broadway' came with a very lightly and crispy breaded chicken with cheese and aioli between two buns. The chicken was juicy and tender. The 'Pimp Shrimp' was pieces of tempura shrimp and spicy slaw and cilantro pico sauce on top of a whole skinless cucumber. The cucumber was refreshing after bites of the fried shrimp and spicy sauce. The sweet potato side was amazing that I couldn't stop eating it. It had bits of sugar that enhanced the sweetness of the potatoes and I highly recommend this side.

I've had their gluten free flat bread ""Berries the Steak"" ($9). It was absolutely delicious. Just the right about of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much, I ordered it every time.
My bf has tried the ""Nice to Greek You"" ($7) flatbread and liked it, but if you don't like olives, there's olives in there. He also has tried the ""Cherry Popper"" ($12) burger with the hawaiian roll and egg in it and he claims it to be one of the best burgers he's had in Vegas so far (We've tried Bachi already).
My friend had the infamous ""Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis"" ($12) aka chicken and waffles and it was extremely delicious. Super tender chicken and flaky crusting.
I've also tried their fresh juices and they were pretty kick-ass. I just thought they were slightly overpriced (ranges $8-9.50) which is pretty much the price of my meal. 

SkinnyFats has not disappointed and they have very friendly and attentive staff. Food is very well priced. I'm super excited they are going to open a new location in SW soon! They really needed that because seating is limited at their main location. When you get there, find your seat and you order at the register. Plenty of parking and located in a commercial building area.

Not only is the name creative, the food was spectacular. They have something for everyone, from smoothies, juices, burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, appetizers, salads and sides. You can opt for a healthy veggie side or go with some yummy truffle fries. You can have an all fruit drink to an awesome 100% cane sugar soda. As for me, well I took the fatty route and went with the fries and soda. 

I ordered the steak eyes. (2 biscuits, with 2 pieces of steak dipped in a country style badder, 2 pouched eggs, and sausage gravy) omg, it was bomb!! The meal is very filling, and could of been split. I couldn't even finish it and I left stuffed. The biscuits were soft and moist, the steak was a good and tender, the eggs were on point, and the crazy was flavorful. I highly recommend this breakfast choice, especially for the egg Benedict lover. 
My wifey ordered the filet o fire. (Filet mignon, avocado Pico, jalepeno spread, on a garlic Texas toast) She loved it and was very impressed for being a sandwich. The truffle fries were good and reminded me of Gordon Biersch garlic fries. Yummy. We also ordered the yummus (hummus with pita seasoned in a lime sea salt).

Finally came upon the opportunity to eat at SkinnyFats again, and this time around they did NOT disappoint!! We went during the week, at night and it was busy but not packed. We walked in the door, waited for the couple in front of us to finish ordering and were then greeted by a most helpful gal. I had my eye on a few things, she helped me boil it down and made recommendations. My husband ordered The Classic and I ordered the Filet o'Fire, both with truffle fries. We also ordered the 3 types of cookies they had freshly baked, to go: blueberry lemon, salted caramel, and chocolate chip. 

The Filet o'Fire was FREAKING FANTASTIC!! I can't imagine ever having a better steak sandwich ever, for as long as I may live. No exaggeration. It was spicy, the filet was cooked to perfection and very tender, the bread, oh my God the bread....toasty, griddled perfection. I begrudgingly gave my husband a taste. He also said it was the $h!t. 

My husband said The Classic was super delish, I wouldn't know since I never came up for air from my own sandwich. 

The truffle fries were damned good!! Next time I may try the sweet potato fries though, just to mix it up. 

And now, the cookies. SWEET LORD, THEY ARE MANNA FROM HEAVEN! The salted caramel cookie is the absolute best thing I've ever stuck in my gullet....I mean, besides the Filet o'Fire. Seriously.

On top of inconsistent delivery, the last order we did was pretty  bad.  It was as if the food was pretty much dumped into the boxes.

This one happens to be 1 block south of Larry Flint's Hustler Club, but don't let that in any way deter you from trying this fantastic eatery. The name SkinnyFATS translated to various items which are low cal, vegan, non GMO and other items that might not be so much. So in essence, everyone gets covered at this establishment with no compromise on either side. 

This place is small, and the time to get your food is about 30 min with line cue, ordering and food wait. But the staff is super friendly, really know the menu and very efficient.

We had the Wake N Bacon  ($9.95) which was bacon, eggs, pepper jack, avocado, & sriracha. Team cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with a side, which we chose the sweet potato fries. A nice breakfast sandwich, easy to eat, and mild in flavor despite the sriiracha and pepper jack.

We also tried the Sweet Cheese Us ($12.95) which was shaved NY strip, pepper marmalade, Carmelized onions, pepper jack, portobello, a cheddar sauce served on a hoagie. We thought the flavor really popped, and the ingredients were spilling out of the sandwich onto our hands the way a real cheesesteak sandwich does.

Pretty diverse menu, with juices and shakes, breakfasts (served all day), salads, tacos, burgers, and bowls bother meat and vegan.

To make it easy for idiots like me, ""healthy"" is served on the left side of the menu, and ""Happy"" is served on the right side of the menu. Calories are listed on the left side but void on the right side!",1,0,3

The burger was pretty big in size. Happy to have split it. It tasted pretty good.

The truffle fries were disappointing.. Very bland\/no salt really.

The orange you happy was tasty. The frozen yogurt in it was good along with the juice they put inside. Also, this was a good-sized drink. Splitting was a good choice.

It was our least favorite item, though the fried dough it comes with is soft and flaky. We're originally from NY and both a bit snobby about ""Buffalo chicken"" flavor anything, to be honest.

SkinnyFATS is my Brigadoon of dining establishments.  You have to have a heart that's true to navigate the mysterious vortex that is Dean Martin and Sunset - but stick to it, fellow diners!  For when you arrive at SkinnyFATS you're in for some great food.  

Yesterday I went and ordered The Sweet Cheese Us sammich with a side of fruit.  I wanted the truffle fries so badly, as they are Heavenly but I'm watching my figure.  The side of fruit was nice though - not just a sad cup of melon with the solitary grape that is so standard in the world of fruit sides.  This side of fruit had watermelon, honeydew, lots of grapes, pineapple and some cantaloupe.  Jackpot!  The Sweet Cheese Us was delicious.  I was trying to come up with the perfect description for it and it hit me - it's an artisan Philly cheese-steak.  Or maybe a couture cheese-steak would be more appropriate.  Pick one, it doesn't matter because it's delicious.  The shaved NY Strip used is tender and tasty, the caramelized onions a perfect, and the portabello mushrooms are a nice touch.  

The prices seem a little steep - but the portions are HUGE.  Here's a tip - go with a friend and split a sandwich.  I was alone yesterday and barely put a dent in my meal.  Another nice little tip to save dollars - don't order a beverage because they provide complimentary cucumber lemon water that is so cold and refreshing.  I had already ordered a soda and regretted that as soon as I took a swig of their special water.

I came with some friends for lunch last weekend around 11. The place wasn't packed yet but it was getting there. We found a corner table and ordered at the counter once our entire party had arrived. 

I opted for the cranburkey with a side of slaw chee. We got truffle fries as well. My friends ordered various other items and we waited for our food. It came out pretty quickly. We ordered items from both the healthy and happy sides of the menu for good measure. The fries were tasty and very truffle-y. The cranburkey was a bit on the bland side. I have to admit, I'm not typically a big fan of turkey burgers so that May have been my own fault for ordering this. My friend was a little unimpressed with her salad, saying it was a little bland and wishing there was more flavor and diversity in texture. She enjoyed her turkey slider, though. My other friend got the drunken gypsy French toast and seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. I had been  tempted by the healthy breakfast items, so I'll likely go that way if I ever come back again.

Prices weren't horrible but it got pricy when we had add one and for drinks, which we ended up skipping. The restaurant is tiny and 30 minutes into our meal there were quite a few people hovering around waiting for tables so we didn't stay long to chat knowing people were waiting. This made it a less than ideal place to go if you're hoping to have a leisurely brunch with friends to catch up. 

SkinnyFats is bordering between a 3 and 4 star for me, but I think I'll need to give them another try to see if there are any other menu items I might enjoy more.",4,2,3

-Hard to find in the middle of a business center
-Barely any room to sit
-Food from other orders gets mixed into my breakfast pancakes... I wonder how that happened?

To elaborate, I ordered the pineapple pancakes (which were delicious btw) and there were some carmelized onions cooked into part of the bottom pancake that clearly did not belong. Probably a part of some egg scramble someone else ordered that got left on the pan. Which begs the question: How often to they clean the pans they use? On the other hand, it shows that they cook all their food and don't just heat up frozen meals (like some places I know)

For the area it definitely beats out the other few options. Our office has been ordering nearly everyday since they opened. They would occasionally mess up the orders, but small things ( no tomatoes , dressing on the side and so on.. ) not that big of deal. Then it started to really go down hill once they became popular.  Our office favorite is the ""Flat Chix & Greens"" . Which at first came with a side . Now it does not. Not the end of the world. They then raised the price a long with nearly everything else 20% plus. Then when you thought it was going to stop there they decreased the portion sizes. I got 4.5 oz of chicken today compared to the avg 7.5oz+ . I guess back to divine cafe :(

Ps. On multiple occasions ""Not believing it was being caused by the juice"" I have ordered their ""Mr.Green"" every time this has completely messed up my stomach . I have done multiple day juice cleanses and drink green juice regularly. I'm not sure what is different in theirs but it messes me up.

If you're unfamiliar with their menu I call it the good and evil menu - there's healthy options and then an evil indulgent version on the other side of the menu.

Food:
Hubby decided to go with the ""Secret menu"" with Hot Mess nachos - delicious buffalo chicken tenders with fresh jalape√±os and tortilla chips with cheese sauce, pico, and sour cream.
I went with the cucumber boat meal of ""Tu-Nuts"" with Ahi tuna, eel sauce and spicy mayo with Asian relish - YUM! ... Admittedly we shared the Drunken monkey cakes... 3 hot cakes with bananas foster and whipped cream and chocolate chips and marshmallows... And applewood smoked bacon. 

... Tomorrow is a two-a-day workout, yes

Service and environment: maybe we're still excited on the ""moving-to-Vegas"" high, but we're excited to have a place like SkinnyFATS close to home. TONS of healthy options, fresh ingredients, amazing variety and fun on the menu. Also, the staff was very patient and friendly to welcome us in, tell us about the secret menu, and even help make decisions.

To be able to find various healthy menu items while my family is still able to indulge. The struggle of staying healthy is real! We came on a Monday at 2PM. I figured it would be slow but boy were we wrong. There were no tables at the time, and the line was wrapped around the bar (which seems to be common) but people ate quickly and cleared out so we were able to grab a 4 top. From the photos of the food, I had no idea it was an order at the counter sort of place, but probably wonderful for the many people who made to-go orders that work nearby. 

After reviewing their menu and it being (unfortunately) too late to eat breakfast, I opted for the slow boat to China and sriricha ahi taco. My husband got the cherry popper burger with truffle fries and ordered the veg-to-bowl and yummus for the kids. They have a children's menu which was very disappointing... I get that in America, we're used to shoving garbage down our kids throat and pray they don't get type II diabetes by the time they're 25, but come on. At a place like this, I was hoping for a healthier kids menu than chicken fingers, peanut butter and jelly, & PB & banana. 

The food arrived not too long after and we dug in. The kids LOVED the yummus with pita. I was really surprised how much they liked it since the rosemary was so potent in it that it turned off my husband. They also really enjoyed the vegetable bowl with tofu and a plethora of veggies. The portobello fried rice was dreamy. Definite thumbs up for the veg-to-bowl even though it's on the happy side. My husband really enjoyed his burger, but had the exact same complaints as Jade. He picked it up, took a bite, and told me that he is scared to put the thing down because it will definitely fall apart next time he picks it up. His plate looked like a plate of soup by the time he was done and said he would ask them to toast the bun more next time and apply less sauce. 

My sriricha ahi taco and slow boat were alright. I think they use too much sauce here with their aiolis being at the front of the menu. There was definitely too much aioli and sauce in general on my slow boat.  I could barely taste the ingredients. The tuna in my ahi taco were mediocre at best with them being rubbery along with the tortilla. The slawchee in it was delicious and the flavors in the taco were great. I just wish the tuna was less rubbery. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the results. While we are indeed sauce lovers, we will have to ask for less sauce on everything next time so we can really taste the ingredients.",4,3,3

After Yelping a couple of breakfast spots near where I was staying, I decided upon SkinnyFats and I was not disappointed.  The overall decor and ambience feels utterly San Francisco-ish:  just my kind of vibe.  

I love that there are two sides to the menu:  the Skinny side and the Fat side.  So if you happen to go with other people who have a different eating agenda\/philosophy, this place will definitely mediate that situation.  Though my inclination was to go ahead and order off of their Skinny menu, the vacation part of my mind overruled such thoughts.

I decided upon the country fried steak since I wanted to try something I don't normally eat.  I also tried the chicken and waffles, along with the sugarbetes-inducing banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  

Here's more of the breakdown:

Country Fried Steak:  Yum.  The ""Steak"" itself consists of layers upon layers of thinly sliced New York steak encased in a crunchy, well-seasoned batter, fried to perfection.  It is carefully positioned on a bed of biscuits and topped off with a smothering of country gravy.  Eggs (cooked however you like) accompany the dish.  Every component of this dish synced nicely together.  The steak tasted like a better rendition of your grandma's home cooking.  I suppose it's a cleaner-tasting, more professional reboot of the country classic.

Chicken and Waffles:  Chicken and waffles is a classic dish in its own right.  I have tried the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and I was not impressed, as I think two things make the dish:  moist, melt-in-your-mouth chicken and light and crispy waffles.  My visit to Roscoe failed at both.  So what is it like here?  The chicken is moist, but very meaty and the waffle is crispy, but not as light as I would have preferred.  I still think the best chicken and waffles can be found at Bruxies (out in SoCal).  

Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes:  It's good.  It's a sweet concoction.  I would never be able to finish a whole order by myself, but I could see myself eating one or two bites.  Then again, I do not have a sweet tooth.

The verdict:  it was all good.  I will add this to my list of places to come back and eat whenever I am in Vegas.",0,0,0

We came here for one of my birthday stops, so my friends allowed me to order everything I wanted even if it was excessive and more than I could eat. That way they were forced to eat everything with me and I got to taste a lot of dishes!

We ordered:

-Wake'N' Bacon: Applewood bacon, egg Frittata, Pepper back Jack, avocado, Sriracha scallion cream cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with country potatoes. (I substituted the turkey for bacon) The sandwich was delicious! I usually like my potatoes a little more well done but they still tasted good. 

-Cherry Popper: half pound beef patty (we substituted a turkey burger), fried egg, pepper jack, spicy slaw pepper marmalade, on a Hawaiian roll. Wish I could eat this bad everyday! 

-Hot Chix salad: buffalo chicken, romaine, fried jalape√±o, blue cheese, pico, with avocado jalape√±o ranch dressing. This tasted way too good to be considered a salad! This chix was hot, 

-Balls .2-two deep fried spinach corn risotto balls with pesto aioli and bulls blood and micro greens. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Order these! These were the clear winner of the meal! Everyone loved them! 

- Frickles (off the secret menu) which are Fried pickle chips tossed in Cajun seasoning and served with our house made chipotle aioli. Yummy! 

It's super cute inside but also small. They only have about 10 tables inside if that. This place is not off the strip and we had to take an Uber here. Even though it was inconvenient to get there it was still worth stopping by! 

They serve fresh squeezed juice, shakes, and lots of healthy choices but I was not interested in any of those when I was there! You can leave skinny or fat...you decide!",77,61,77

The staff was very helpful and seemed to be carefully understanding my requests. The chef on the other hand, not so much. The server brought out our food and announced 'gluten free' when he set it down. The only reason I noticed it wasn't right is when I requested a side of the sauce they don't use on the dish to make it gluten free (my partner does not have a gluten allergy) it was a very different color from what it has been in the past. It didn't register until after I took a bite of the food and tasted so different from how I remembered. I then decided to ask what was going on with this 'gluten free' dish and come to find out they did not use the correct sauce and I was poisoned. Our meal and our time here was ruined. As much as I love this place for trying to offer gluten free options I will not be dining here any longer.

Definitely come a little earlier to beat the lines as this place definitely fills up fast (they have limited table seatings since the place is kind of small).

We ordered:

1) Wake n' Bacon: A Hawaiian roll with applewood bacon, egg frittata, pepper jack cheese, avocado, sriracha scallion cream cheese with country potatoes. Doesn't that just sound enticing? This was one of our favorites. The sauce is really addicting (5\/5)

2) Spudghetti: You guessed it. Potato noodles!!! It comes with bacon, shredded cheddar, sour cream and green onions. We were excited to try it because it's quite creative. The potato noodles had great texture but the overall taste was a bit dull because it could have had more flavoring besides the sour cream and onions. We expected it to be more flavorful but it kind of tasted somewhat bland, but a good try though (4\/5)

3) More Cow Bowl: If you like rice bowls, then definitely get this one. There's teriyaki filet mignon, portobello mushrooms, cauliflower, sliced bell peppers, green onions over egg fried rice. It's pretty filling and definitely shareable. The meat was kind of overcooked but overall, it was decent (4\/5)

4) Chix On Broadway: A healthy take on your burger with breaded chicken breast, cheddar, onion, lemon herb aioli on a brioche bun with your choice of side. I chose truffle fries and they were pretty good. The chicken was definitely a bit burnt but it was a good one to try nonetheless. Let me just tell you that the burger is HUGE. I ate half and my bf finished the rest (5\/5)

I had the Sweet and Spicy with milk and fro yo. It was as advertised--the spicy being mostly a ginger flavor. My gluten free pizza food was wonderful. It had steak and enough greens on top to be a salad. I probably over-ordered, since this was a lot of food for me. (Maybe sharing the shake or the pizza would be better!)

It was tricky to locate their place in the first place, we thought we drove into someone's warehouse. Turned out their restaurant is inside of an office like building. The interior was cute, medium sized with a lot of tables and high bars. Food ordering has never been that easy for me as they have skinny and fatty choices where they labeled all the calories on the menu. (Oh my MFP thank you! ) 

I had their turkey burger and some skinny soup of the day, my SO ordered the classic burger and I took the big bite of his out of ""I must try your food"" curtsy.

I couldn't decide, panicked and ordered the  cinnutella. I don't think I had ever had Nutella before and I'm not a big fan of chocolate. I'm not sure why I chose a dish that listed it as a feature but it turned out well. I really liked the way it complimented the sweet cinnamon bread & berries.  The bread was a little heavy on cinnamon & sugar but that's just my taste. The crispy carmelized edges were the bomb. My daughter ordered the chickawaffadopolis.  The chicken was so tender that it fell apart with a fork. If you Iike chicken & waffles, you will dig this dish.

Half of us old timers where I was in the half of first timer. I never even heard of this place without help of  my yelp family. Its gotten lot of buzz hear people talking about SkinnyFats. I excited about checking the hype. 

Talk about interesting location. I totally wrong turned it  so had too big circle loop back along way notice that nothing around it at all. If looking for restaurant never find it. It located in more of small retail business office area rather then free standing restaurant. Make sure going down Dean Martin Drive keep your eye out for the big happy smile face. Once you do find it realize SkinnyFats is diamond in the rough. 

Never think such small office space that they could be putting out amazing Healthy or Happy side meals. They truly do!!! I was surprise by the selection too choose from since such tiny place. Really only hold less then fifty seats. We all meet up at craziest time lunch prime time. Literally if not for Mel and Terri showing up before or around 11am never got seat. Noon the place is ridiculous. The line out the door and good luck finding place too sit down. There reason why the place is packed really good food.

I went with the Phatty Philly. Amazing. I love the fact nice thick slices of meat not your typical philly style sandwich. Even the portobello mushrooms (perfectly roasted and well seasoned) nice thick slices. The goat cheese and the onions. Sure missing two more ingredients. It had lot of things going on inside but the BEST part was everything balanced each other too perfection. Every bite was awesome. The bread that the served on was great! Not sure if cause Happy side but my order came with side. I went with the truffle fries. I thought was solid. I love the condiments that each table came with especially the salt shaker. Flavor ketchup swear that was first for me. Balsamic or Jalapeno flavored ketchup. Interesting. I never tried either but next visit taste them with some fries. 

The service was great. Even when it was mad crazy they did great job of keeping up on everything. They thanked you for your patience once got your food. Sure plan on coming back but not during rush hour traffic. Bit much.",6,4,5

Their menu has a ""healthy"" side and a ""happy"" side. My hubby and I opted for something on the happy side. I had a Cheezy Peezy, a pizza heavily packed with cheese. I was excited because I'm a total cheese lover, but the goat cheese was packed on, so the taste was very strong. I could only eat one piece. Hubby ordered a Meltdown. I took a couple of bites from it and it was pretty good. We both had a side of truffle fries. We thought they were good, but not too much different than regular french fries. We also ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was amazing! The lemonade is made in-house and it tastes so fresh. 

Although the food did not wow us, the service was really good. I wish I knew the name of the girl who talked to us, but she was super helpful. She gave us a lot of suggestions and had a good attitude which I always respect.

Now, let's get to the food.

The cashier can spot first timers who aren't quite prepared to order and will ask them to sit down to look over a menu. 

On the left side of the menu are their HEALTHY SIDE selections split into BREAKFAST or EVERYTHING ELSE.  Same deal on HAPPY SIDE on the right of the page.  For an extra charge, add more proteins and or carbs.

Both of our selections are from the HAPPY SIDE:
 
Cherry Popper:  1\/2 lb beef patty (Medium Rare) cherry\/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack, and fried egg on a Hawaiian roll with the sweet potato fries as the side ...  quality ground beef that is not too lean and without any gristle that inevitably gets caught between the teeth ... with the condiments it's a burger connoisseur's dream come true.

Tu-Nuts:  Spicy ahi and sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat with almonds,  teriyaki,  avocado and Sriracha aioli. This is so tasty and healthy. If cucumber is not your thing, there's Ahi Sriracha with Slaw Chee, mango, Pico & spicy yo-aioli in a wheat soft taco.

I've been back several times and have loved it every time.   They have put together a combination of awesome food, fun atmosphere and a staff that is incredibly cool and engaging that is tough to beat in Vegas.  

One of my favorite things to do at a new restaurant is ask the server what they would get, and often I get a dumbfounded look and then just a bunch of questions about what I want.  When I ask the question at Skinny Fats, I get a passionate response full of insider tips.

The best thing I've had so far is the ""Smotherload Burrito"".  One of the best I've ever had.  And ENORMOUS!  The Chicken and Waffles chowder is also phenomenal. 

You really can't go wrong with Skinny Fats, although I can't say with confidence that the ""Skinny"" side of the menu is any good.  I haven't ordered anything off that side yet... Don't tell my wife ;-)

It can be hard to find a table, so be prepared for that.  However, not being able to find a table is usually a good sign that you're in the right place!",1,0,1

Food: I got the chicks on broadway sandwich with truffle fries. I thought the sandwich was okay. I feel like it lacked some taste. I actually liked it more as leftovers because the sauce was thicker from being out. The truffles fries were decent. If I wanted fries, I think I would have just got the regular ones.

They provide a nice big menu with a ""skinny"" side of options as well as a ""happy"" side of options. Both the happy and healthy dishes are both loaded with unique flavor which can be so hard for restaurants to accomplish. 

I have had both breakfast and lunch options, both healthy and happy. the whole wheat protein pancakes with two pieces of turkey bacon are a must anytime I go! I look at them as a dessert so I'll get them with one of the delicious sandwiches or other items they offer.

You can't be Skinny and Fat at the same time right?  Some guys are coming close!  The concept of this restaurant is very original.  Create two distinct menus that appeals to foodies of all types.  The health conscious and the zero f***ks given camp.  Guess what I am!? Exactly, my time at SkinnyFATS was spent browsing the fat portion of the menu.  I did do a quick browse of the healthy side and to be honest there was some items that I would order like the TBLT.  For the gordo's the choices are plentiful.  I ended up splitting 2 dishes  The CHIX on Broadway and the Sweet Cheese Us.  The CHIX on Broadway had to be the best chicken sandwich I ever had.  The fried breast was enormous and spilled over the sides of the bun.  It was crunchy, tasty, crispy.  It was a sensory overload for my taste buds.  The Sweet Cheese Us was very good as well, but the CHIX was the star of my meal that day.  

The location is off strip and in an industrial part of town.  It is very accessible for those that are leaving Vegas and headed back towards LA since it runs parallel to the 15 freeway.

I'm lucky to be friends with girls who love brunch just as much as I do. So we all decided to give this place a try! We took the taxi here and though it wasn't the cheapest ride (approx. $30 including tip for a one way trip from our hotel on the strip), it was the last thing on our mind after eating an amazing meal at SkinnyFATS.

Between the four of us, we ordered the WTFrench Toast - a delicious french toast with turkey patty, cranberry sauce, arugula & spicy berry marmalade ($10), the UnBRIElievable Brioche french toast - french toast served wit brie, basil, strawberries, and a rich balsamic glaze ($9.50), and their special of the day, BACON POT PIE BENEDICT ($12). Both french toasts were equally amazing. The WTFrench Toast was fluffier and lighter, yet it still managed to pack a mean punch of awesomeness. The UnBRIElievable was more sinful - french toast was perfectly fried to a golden brown color and the combination of the brie and balsamic glaze gave it a richer taste that excited the tastebuds.

But the winner has to go to... *cue angelic music* the bacon pot pie benedict. I've never had anything quite like it! It's not a dish you want to eat all by yourself... but I definitely ate 80% of it. The dish comes with a miniature pot pie stuffed with diced bacon pieces, potatoes, peas, and carrots. On the side, it came with one egg Benedict and a large fried jalape√±o stuffed with a mystery stuffing.. that was just as amazing!

So... have I convinced you to try this place out? (:",0,0,0

It took about an hour and 20 minutes to stand in line, order, wait for a table, watch the spectacle of people fighting over a table, hear people complaining to staff, get our food, eat some of it and send some of it back, and leave. Whew...it's only 12:30 and we are exhausted! 

We ordered the steak eyes: steak medallions were barely cooked rare. Almost bloody and completely red. DISGUSTING. We didn't eat the meat. We threw $11.99 down the drain with that one. Biscuits were also very try and there wasn't very much gravy at all on any of. Between dry and hard biscuits and the lack of gravy and raw meat, it was terrible. 

Chicken & waffles: it was ok. We won't ever get it again, but it was something that we wanted to try. 

Chicken finger bowl and truffle fries, minus buffalo sauce. Chicken was burnt. Fries were fresh and delicious, but chicken was BURNT. Asked for a new order. Instead of 6 pieces of chicken, a mini order with 3 pieces came out. Took it to go because it took so long to be remade. BOMB. 

I tried to be healthy so I ordered the pineapple whole wheat pancakes. They were decent. Very dry, though. Not sure if I love them. I ate one and threw the other in a box, which I will probably toss. 

Overall, food was WAY OFF. Not sure if they are training new cooks or what, but it stunk today. And for $50 for everyone to leave sort of eh, that wasn't good. I was disappointed. Fam was disappointed. 

Also, the food came out at all different times and some of us didn't get our food until others were almost done eating. Not good. 

Service wasn't good today either, and that surprises me more than the food because last time everyone was SO amazing! Today the poor staff was just trying to squeeze between people without dropping plates to deliver food. Register girl looked higher than a kite. 

Worst part of it all: people were yelling and fighting over tables. Seating system sucks and provokes people to fight for a seat. So lame. There should be a rule and system, that one must place an order and have a number before taking a table. And there should be a line on the left hand side isle way by the restroom where people should line up in order to get a table. Because when it's just that busy and wait times are that long and people are hungry, we were seeing the devil in them, and it wasn't pretty because I brought kids to breakfast, not a brawl.

First and foremost, the excitement of their new location opening soon on the Northwest side of town is beyond me! In the same shopping center as Costco.

They give you that healthy balance feel here with their all American style menu with a pinch of diversity. It's always fresh and fast for the most part.

I was not disappointed!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because of the size and limited seating. Came here around 2 in the afternoon, so what I thought would be after rush hour (it's in an industrial part of town, so I expected lunchtime to be a madhouse); it was still crazy busy and we got really lucky with a seat for two at the counter against the window. 

The employees were very friendly, and the interior itself reminds me of a restaurant you'd find in LA or NYC- definitely not typical Vegas. The menu was a great concept- healthy versus happy choices- but somewhat unorganized and difficult to understand. They were very accommodating to any dietary requests, which I know can be difficult in this day and age. 

The food was incredibly fresh and yummy!! Sweet N Spicy milkshake- apple, ginger, beets, banana- and Drunken Gypsy Toast- cr√©me br√ªl√©ed brioche, fresh berries and bananas (I certainly got a lot of bananas, didn't I), and applewood smoked bacon. So delish!!

I wasn't even half way pleased. Arrived at about 4:45 on a Sunday, well before their 6pm closing time. First walking in, I noticed the drink machine was behind the counter. Oh helllll no. If I'm going to pay $2 for a small drink, I want to fill it up MYSELF when I want. I shouldn't have to go wait in the outrageous line just to have my drink filled. I proceeded to order the chick-a-waffa-dopalis (best spelling I could manage). It's their chicken & waffles. Lemme tell you, I love chicken & waffles so my expectations were high. I also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. My chick&waff didn't take too long so when it got to the table I was optimistic. Good sized waffle topped with a good amount of boneless chicken strips. Unfortunately, I firstly noticed that there was barely any syrup AT ALL on top. I had to ask for a side of it. I first took a bite of a chicken strip... Delicious!!! The small amount of syrup was just enough to make the tender chicken have a sweet taste. This turned out to be the only part of my experience that I enjoyed. I then proceeded to try the waffle.... It was barely even warm. Borderline cold. Terrible. I had to take bites of the chicken and waffle at the same time just to make it seem like the waffle was warm. Oh and the sweet potato truffle fries?? Halfway into my meal and I still haven't received them, but my friend had gotten his. What's worse than that? I also hadn't received my drink half way into my meal. That's absolute horrible service. A lady walked by and my friend asked for a side of syrup and she quickly turned and said ok and I tried to ask for my drink but she quickly turned and hurried to the back. Very rude. So about half way into my meal, I have a completely cold waffle, no more chicken, no fries and no drink. Will not return.",0,0,0

Located in middle of nowhere on Dean Martin Road. Place is easy to find with their smily face logo on the garage door facing the road. Ambiance is hip and cozy with limited seating.

From taco section, we ordered both taco from fat side: ahi taco-san and picata pi√±ata. Although both were flavorful, I can't handle much spiciness so I personally liked ahi taco-san better.  4\/5 for ahi taco and 3\/5 for picata pi√±ata.

Opted for hot mess as an appetizer. Basically a fusion nacho that comes with pieces of fried chicken topped with spicy sauce and sour cream. Indeed, it was an hot mess to eat but it was amazing. 4\/5.

Two entrees, again from the fat side of menu. Steak eye is their version of chicken fried steak. It was chicken fried steak on a biscuit with creamy mashed potato. 4\/5.

Bomb diggity is a BLT sandwich with lots of crispy bacon. Some pieces were over cooked and rather chewy than crispy. Simple and good. 4\/5. 

All were good but nothing memorable. I don't appreciate how they clearly mark and section off the healthy and fat section because it makes you feel guilty for choosing everything off the fat side especially when you are pigging out like myself...jk  I will be back again!",8,6,7

It was perfect -- chewy, dense, toasty and not overly sweet.  The berries on top were juicy and sweet.  The french toast didn't really need syrup -- maple or agave!

My boyfriend ordered the More Cow Bowl and he loved it.  He's picky about how meat is cooked, and he said that the beef was perfectly done and not overcooked. The presentation was unique and the veggies and rice were flavorful.

Cons- it's extremely small. Seating is first come first served. So it's a

Out of all those items I think I enjoyed the God Fries the most while everything else was okay. The God fries had chicken, feta and other things that made a nice contrast of flavors and textures. If you order the Shroomin' Philly, just note that it is vegetarian because there is no beef in there at all. You might be better off ordering the Phatty Philly even if it is on the Happy Side. I was deceived by the picture and thought there was meat until I started eating the sandwich. The chicken and waffles was pretty standard, but definitely no wow factor. Make sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side because there was a little bit too much for my liking. I haven't ordered these items but tried them from another person's plate:Tu nuts, Ahi Sirachi tacos, and Naked chicks all of which are very tasty and I highly recommend! If anything look at the Yelp pictures and if it looks good then it should be good. 

People talk about a line, but I guess that's only during the lunch hour rush because I've never encounter it on my past 4 visits.

The menu has two sides: the skinny side (healthy-ish food) and the fat side (drop dead delicious horrible-for-you food).  The concept is fresh and I find it amusing for some reason; the place makes me smile.  I also love the fact that they have infused water for patrons.  It's a nice treat.

But the food is hit and miss I've found.  I love the Siracha Ahi Tacos, but there is soooo much dressing on the slaw that it drips everywhere and makes the tortillas soggy.  The chicken and waffles was excellent.  My friend got the Cranburkey sandwich from the Skinny side and said it was very dry.  The burger my husband had was amazing.

I've had SkinnyFats bookmarked ever since I read Amanda M and Nelson Q's review back in July. The gf even told me about this place and wanted to go.  She made it, I didn't.  But now I'm here. 

So if you read the other reviews, then you get the gist of what SkinnyFats is all about.  They have a ""Healthy"" side and a ""Happy"" side.  Obviously, the ""Happy"" side is your higher calorie options while the ""Healthy"" side is for those trying to clean it up.  There's a selection here for everyone, which makes this place a must try at least once.  But a place like SkinnyFats may not be for everyone.   First of all, the Healthy side isn't super clean.  It's just clean for eating out.  As for their ""Happy"" side, it's higher calorie but not crazy high.  

As a first-timer, I decided on getting something on the ""Healthy"" side. What I get? I got their Healthy Juan Wrap, which consisted of egg whites, chicken breast, black beans, turkey sausage\/bacon, brown rice, cilantro yogurt, cheese and pico all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.  When I ordered this bad boy, I was told that the Juan had 3 egg whites and 6 oz. of chicken.  My goodness, this has to be 50+ grams of protein.  Sweet..this takes care of two meals for me.  I loved my order.  I know it's a wrap, but to me this tasted like a healthier version of huge breakfast burrito.  I killed it and left SkinnyFats satisfied.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=GolhEXzqrzu1AthjhU7RFQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Now for the ambiance.  SkinnyFats is one popular and tiny restaurant.  I say popular because the lines made it outside.  This place gets crazy and loud.  And because it gets so busy around noon, our orders took some time.  So take my advice, SkinnyFats is a place to try, but not around lunch time.

Upon entering we noticed a long line, definitely a good sign. This gave us time to look at the menu, but we quickly knew what we wanted.  I decided on the Chickhumm ($10) - grilled chicken, arugula, tomato, red onions, and hummus on a wheat bun with truffle fries. It's very hard these days to find a delicious and healthy burger, but at SkinnyFats that won't be a problem. The Chickhumm was amazing, drool worthy. It originally comes with sprouts, but I personally don't like sprouts so I substituted it with arugula and it tasted great. The ginormous piece of grilled chicken was cooked nicely and not overcooked\/burnt. The housemade hummus went perfectly with all the ingredients, no ketchup was needed!  When did a restaurant ever use hummus on a burger (not in my experience at least)? Kudos to the restaurant! The truffle fries were just as great. The truffle fries didn't come salted, but they do provide you with salt if you'd like them salted. I personally prefer my fries either lightly salted or not salted at all. I had a taste of the sweet potato fries and even though the truffle fries were great, I preferred the sweet potato fries. The best part, the burger and fries did not leave a huge grease stain on the napkins\/paper mat. This definitely goes to show how much grease is actually used or the lack of. 

SkinnyFats has a wide menu ranging from salads, tacos, burgers, waffles and smoothies.  They also provide delivery to the strip, so if you're with a group of friends and want a nice affordable meal, SkinnyFats is only a call away. Unfortunately if you order at this location, you will probably have to enjoy the meal to-go since there is very limited seating. Even though the line was long, it did move. Considering how many customers they have at a given time, there was some confusion\/mix-ups on meal orders of the other customers. It was quickly straightened out though.

We do not want to have to walk a mile for food or deal with the usual Vegas strip crowds. It was worth the hunt to find this little gem. We enjoyed it so much, that even though it was one of our more expensive meals, we had planned on returning a second time to eat here in the same Vegas visit (but we went home early instead) 

The food is GREAT! I love the unusual offerings. I love that they give you both healthy and not as healthy options and tell you which is which. I LOVED the drink options and we really enjoyed the drink we bought and kept the cup too, very cute. The service was great and the people working there are very sweet. 
So, why only 4 stars? Well, I kinda hated that it was such a small area to eat and we were stuck cooking in the sun while we were there. Every time a table would open up in shade, someone else would grab it and that's understandable, but you can see how it's time to expand right? lol  and the other thing was, I kinda hate that it came to $40 but I had no leftovers or that you don't get much food for your money. The only other meal I paid more for was AYCE sushi. When you are attempting to budget your meals, you want more for your money. That being said, I would rather spend my money getting good tasting healthy food and they deliver. You just gotta make eating there more enjoyable somehow. Second location?

I've been here over three different times and I have yet to write a review for SkinnyFATS, so this is way overdue. During my visits here I have ordered the Cherry Popper, Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis, Vegwich, Flat Chix and Greens and all the fries!Seriously everything I've tried has been so amazing and full of flavor. Some of the highlights are the Vegwich & Cherry Pooper. 

The Vegwich is a skinny menu item and is filled with Portobello mushrooms, avocado, cherry\/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt all on a grain toast. Finally a healthy sandwich that will actually fill you up and not leave you looking for something to snack on in about an hour. I normally get this with side of truffle fries. A true Skinny FAT styled meal! 

The Cherry Popper is a spicy all beef burger topped with cherry\/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack and a fried egg on a Hawaiian sweet roll. Do I really have to explain why this is so tasty? Just re-read above and then try one for yourself. Great burger for a first timer to SkinnyFATS, get it? 

Chicken and waffles, amazing salads, and juices! This place really has it all including a cool vibe and look. Vegas is filled with cookie cutter eateries with mundane surroundings, which is why SkinnyFATS is so refreshing on both your eyes and your palate.

PRO TIP: Before leaving buy a bottle of their house made Jalapeno Ketchup. You'll thank me later.",20,14,15

I ordered 2 Ahi Tacos from the Healthy Side of the menu and the Slob Cobb from Happy Side. The tacos are huge. I could barley finish one! The mango and sriracha are a perfect blend of flavors! My mom ordered the Bombdiggity. It had a ton of Applewood Smoked Bacon and a tangy aoil that works so well with the toasted Sourdough Bread. Of course I could not forget my husband on this visit and ordered him a Chixs on Broadway with Truffle Fries to go. He was very excited to get Skinnyfats all the way at his office in Green Valley.

Like everyone already said, it's hard to find. Although they do have little signs on the lamp posts that let you know you missed the building, cause it's bound to happen.  The restaurant is just too small, although I did go over lunch and it was incredibly busy. But it was off-putting. We couldn't sit until someone else got up from a table, and that just felt a tad awkward.

I ordered the burger benedict. It was OK. Apart from the fried egg in the burger, nothing was ""benedict"" about the burger. I was thinking it would have hollandaise on it or something a bit more. And the burger meat was slightly underseasoned. The truffle fries are epic though and very addicting.

The bf had the neato burrito. It was a breakfast burrito. Nothing remarkable about it.

We tried them at Bite of Las Vegas and actually enjoyed it more there. I got the Chix on Broadway there, which was super yummy. Bacon makes everything better. We also tried the ahi siracha tacos. I know these are one of their best sellers, but I just thought they were OK.

Although I love the concept of a healthy and happy side, being the gluttonous couple that my boyfriend and I are, ordered only off the happy side of the menu. It was so worth it. 

Cherry popper burger: Had some of my boyfriend's and it was so good. The burger was incredibly juicy, the Hawaiian roll was soft and slightly sweet, and the banana and cherry peppers are what makes it! Nice pop of flavor. Also, the fries was crispy and had a nice, subtle truffle taste. 

Smotherload: This was huge and filling. It came with sausage and filet mignon cooked to your liking (medium rare), eggs, potatoes, and pico. It was topped with a Cajun cheese sauce, which I thought was only okay.. I didn't like how gritty and not smooth it was as a sauce. 

They also have a secret menu! We got the Happymess, which was truffle fries with strips of NY steak, pico, and got the blue cheese on the side. Way too much food, but it was all worth it. 

For juices, we got the hangover remedy and green mile. Both were good and a perfect pre-hike boost.

Went on Friday 2-5-16 around 6:30 PM.  This restaurant is located on Dean Martin between Sunset and Russell Road.  It's much smaller inside than the one on Warm Springs and the vibe is more dark and hipster-ish.  $35.28 got us a side of fruit, a warm cookie, a tu-nuts apperizer, a chickhumm sammich, and a buff chix bowl. 
.
$9.95 Tu-nuts appetizer is a cucumber half that they remove the seeds from and then put raw ahi tuna chunks, sriracha slaw, almonds, teriyaki sauce, avocado, and a sriracha aoli on top.  I do not like raw fishes for the most part but my hubs said it was very tasty.  I tried a bite and almost gagged but like I said....I don't like raw fishes!!! 
. 
$9.95 Chickhumm sandwich- had grilled chicken, sprouts, tomatoes, red onions, and hummus on a multigrain bun.  Husband chose brown rice as his side.  I heard no complaints from him and I like that they have sprouts because I don't see those a lot here in Las Vegas.  
. 
$7.95 buff chix- fried buffalo chicken tenders and I swapped out the truffle fries for sweet potato fries.  Their ranch is awesome and the tenders were hot and juicy.  The fries go perfectly with their jalapeno ketchup. 
. 
$1.95 warm cookie was tasty but I definitely would rather have McDonald's version.  The $3.95 side of fruit was so tasty and perfectly ripe.  I love that my hubs can have his healthy crap from the ""healthy side"" and I can eat like a normal person from the ""happy side"".

On a recent visit I ordered the ""cherry popper"" burger. It's a burger topped with a fried egg and banana peppers. It was just around medium rare when it came out - which is fine I suppose, but the burger itself was destroyed. My dining companions both mentioned how smashed the burger looked, as the bun - for some reason - had been compressed and the egg was broken. It's sort of the point, but having had the burger before.. I was just disappointed in the presentation as it didn't look appealing.

Inside is quite small and there were 7 of us. We were allowed to move a couple of tables to accommodate our size. You order first and then have a seat. The menu is divided into a healthy side and a happy side, and have funky unique names; we settled on Apple Bottom, Cluck Moo, Berry Strong Pancakes, Chickawaffadopolis, Waken Bacon, and the pineapple pancakes (can't remember name), coffees, and an apple juice. We all enjoyed our meals, except for the Berry Pancakes. The flavor combinations on that were too much, especially the mint yogurt, for it to be good.

I have been procrastinating this review for months.  This is definitely a hidden gem that I make a point to introduce to my tourist friends.  Great selection of deliciousness . Can't wait until the new location opens on Durango.

Space is limited but high turnover of tables.  It was probably not a good idea that I came with 8 people once but it was manageable.  Dylan was awesome at accommodating us, or was it Dillon? I get them confused.  Everyone on the staff is very welcoming though.  

Hands down, my favorite is the Chix on Broadway - chicken sandwich with great flavors and BACON!!! yum.  Chicken is perfectly moist and juicy.  Comes with a side, I usually get the truffle fries.  Even their ketchup is amazing: choice of regular, jalapeno or balsamic vinegar.

Want something more breakfasty? Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis is a great alternative to the Chix on Broadway.  Same juicy fried chicken tenders but served on a buttermilk waffle.

I usually order ""Orange you happy"" as my beverage - I order it with ice cream but for the health conscious, you have the option of adding frozen yogurt.  Cold pressed juices are available and delicious but usually ""too healthy"" for me.  I've tried the Hangover Remedy, Mr.Green and Liquid Defense.

I tend to hover on the ""happy side"" of the menu, I call it the ""fatty side"" but I've ventured to the ""healthy side."" Slow Boat to China's has a great presentation.  Asian chicken salad served on a cucumber ""boat"".  Ahi Srirachi Taco is good but I preferable it's evil twin Ahi Taco-San, served on a puffed shell.  FYI, one taco is nicely sized.

Stopped here for lunch and beyond thrilled that we tried this little hole in the wall eatery. 
The atmosphere is lively and fun. The service was quick and knowledgeable.  The restaurant was clean with great seating. 

By far the best flavors I've had in a long time. Both my appetizer and entree were layered in flavor. My taste buds were delightfully tantalized. 

First we had a signature entree called the Slow Boat to China. It was a Asian chicken salad ontop of a cute cucumber boat topped with amazing slaw, chopped almonds and a spicy sauce. 

For my entree I had the Cherry Popper burger. It was incredible. I've never tasted anything like this burger before. AHHHHHMAZZZING!!

Great rec, dude-whose-name-I-can't-remember!!

Bulletted thoughts:

-Super-duper friendly staff
-Clean, modern decor
-Filled with locals, as it sits in an industrial park just off the strip--who knew such ""hipness"" existed in a non-descript chunk of the desert?
-Huge portions of food  
-I believe we both ordered off of the Skinny side and were not anywhere near disappointed
-Husband's ""fat"" side treat was 86'd, so the wonderful staff member suggested a substitution off of the skinny side---again, no disappointment here.
-They've got your coveted hippy-dippy juices and health-food-based drinks right along side some good old Diet Coke, milkshakes and beer, hence SkinnyFats.

Hubby had the daily special which was a Thanksgiving-themed eggs Benedict. It was really creative and super tasty.

I can only imagine how busy this place must be given that I was there at 2PM on a weekday. 

Line delay combined with small space led to many people standing around awkwardly with nowhere to sit after placing their order. I ordered to go, but standing for nearly half an hour was not ideal. Unable to determine if tables of people were waiting on food or lingering after finishing their meals.

Food: maybe I didn't get the right menu items to justify the hype but they have cut a lot of popular items from the menu so a few of the things I'd had my eye on are no longer options. Both the customers in front of and behind me in line had the same issue. Change is good when warranted, but when asked, an employee couldn't explain why they were no longer selling highly-requested dishes.

Opted for one of each of the ahi tacos- the ahi sriarchi and the ahi taco-san, one healthy and one happy. 
Healthy one was lacking flavor on the actual fish: healthy doesn't mean you can't season the fish, Daily Wellness Kitchen manages a good seasoning on theirs. Additional toppings added flavor but I was underwhelmed by the blandness of the fish itself.
The ahi taco-san was served on a puffy taco, which got soggy fast with the sauces and watery slaw topping. Flavors were a bit more pronounced with this taco, and I enjoyed the fish despite not generally being a tempura fan. The kitchen was heavy-handed with the mayo-based sauce.

I may come back another (carefully-timed) time to dine-in and try more options (is the cranburkey still there?), and the atmosphere seemed cool, but I will likely just wait until they move to a better location- management has commented that a larger 215\/Rainbow location is in the works.",5,2,1

On my most recent visit I had the Cherry Popper. Popping with flavor it was. The 1\/2 pound beef patty was juicy and the perfect size for the bun.

The burger I had was good.  But the truffle fries... ICK... I don't know what was wrong with it, old truffle oil, too much, or put on hot fries.  The truffle oil just stuck to my tongue and made everything else kinda yucky.  I usually like truffle fries, but in the instance it was just gross.",1,0,0

For food, we got a superstar burrito and the naked chix-i added pineapple to it for extra dollar. The portion was pretty generous, the food tasted great. I am not big fan of american brunch, but I actually enjoyed my food here. The chicken was very tender and the mango basil sauce went really well with the brown rice and the chicken.

The small restaurant was very busy on a Sunday morning but we quickly found a small table. The menu didn't show the Sunday's Sundae that I had seen earlier that day so I wasn't sure if that was part of their secret menu or something and didn't bother to ask. We ordered the chicken and waffles (chickawaffadoppolis?) and the Smotherload steak burrito. We also ordered a cucumber shake and a Hangover Cure juice. My chicken and waffles was better than I expected; juicy, crispy chicken and a crispy warm waffle. I was served about 2 tbsp of syrup and the plate was really big so all of that crispiness started to get dry and I just needed a little more syrup but when I asked for it, the gentleman told me no problem and never came back with it after passing by several times. It seemed as though all the employees were working hard but I felt ignored. The Smotherload was pretty fantastic and flavorful and the cucumber shake was refreshing. Again, I got unlucky and didn't care much for my Hangover Cure juice. It tasted like beets alone and I couldn't finish it. I should have known  beets would overpower the juice though, so I take the blame for poor ordering choices there.

Lack of fresh ingredients

This simple change could take this small establishment and make it live up to the hype that has surrounded it. 
Here are some examples from the food I ate:

Chicken - looked like precooked and sliced packaged chicken slices
Fruit - definitely mass packaged precut fruit
French fries\/ sweet potato fries - frozen

When I 1st pulled into the parking lot I noticed that their location is a little odd and hard to find since it's located inside a business complex with no signage except for the sign above their front door. It was a Sunday just after noon and it was packed inside with no available tables and we had a group of 7 Yelpers. We looked over the menu and placed all of our orders when a couple tables freed up so we snagged them up.

Be aware that the food here comes in large portions! The wedge salad that Nelson Q got looked like it was made with an entire stalk of Romaine lettuce, it was huge! And the chicken sandwich that Amelinda L was eating had a piece of chicken that was larger than the buns\/everything else on the sandwich! I got the chicken and waffles which is on their secret menu that you have to ask for... I'm not sure if there's an acutal menu or if you just have to know what's on it. I only knew about the chicken and waffles because I saw a bunch of people eating it. The chicken was nice, tender and their breading was light and not too crunchy\/hard. I liked that there was more chicken than waffle, unlike other places that skimp on the chicken part so I was pretty happy. I didn't try any of their shakes or juices, but the strawberry lemonade was awesome! Light, refreshing and not too sweet. I also loved the reusable cups complete w\/ happy meter!

I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, especially the healthy ones. If you come here during one of the meal rushes be prepared to order take out or wait for a table since they don't have very many and it's not a big place to begin with.

I've been there many times and although they have a pretty wide variety of food, I've always stuck to their Cranburkey.  It is a Turkey & cranberry patty wtih arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry yogurt on a wheat bun, however, I get mine minus the onion.  It was literally love at first bite.  They have one of the best, if not the best Turkey Burger I've ever had.  I'm actually obsessed with it!  The patty is always cooked to perfection and it is never too dry nor too over cooked and it is always bursting with flavor, and the bun is also always on point.  I hate whenever I take a bite of a burger and the bread is so buttered up that it overpowers the taste of the patty.

I also get a side of their Truffle Fries and honestly, those are usually a hit or miss.  Sometimes they are just way too oily, and although I like them, they usually give me heartburn for some reason.  However, I'm not really trekking 100 miles for their fries.",34,33,34

The menu here is a split menu, one side is some what healthy and the other is healthy. They also have vegetarian and vegan options. The menu is also flexible enough to accommodate any diet. I went full on vegan about a year ago and was ecstatic when the girl behind the counter told me that they can modify the majority of the menu to be vegan. Whohoo!

I wanted to get juice because they look really good but I couldn't bring myself to pay $9.50 for a drink without alcohol in it! Yeah...yipes! So I settled for a ""Jazz Hands"" which was still a little spendy ($4) for what was in it: sprite, ice cream, mango chunks.",2,1,1

So he waited in line for 10 minutes. At 1pm he was finally helped but was told the order wasn't ready yet. Really? He was able to get our order finally at 1:08pm (almost 20 minutes after the scheduled pickup time).

THANK GOODNESS because of the time of day and day of the week, no line. We walk in and although we did not say it, I know we were all surprise to see how small it actually was in there. 

See, I'm torn about giving this place 4 stars vs the 3 stars i gave. I wasnt wowed after hearing of all the hype. Perhaps i have to try something else in order to up the star. But I'll give it 3 stars for now because there was no line, customer service was great, and my actual meal was not bad at all. So it isn't like a 3 star with a negative opinion towards the place.

Before I forget, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT coming here with a large load of people to eat and socialize. Why? It's a very fitting place as in it fits what it needs to. Our table was literally a-out-your-seat and a step to to the counter. You may come with your gang, but have no where to sit without being seperated. I say come here with a couple of your friends for a casual lunch or dinner. Also, DO NOT COME IN HERE WITH A STROLLER, INFANT CARSEAT, DON'T EVEN OPT FOR A HIGH-CHAIR.

It would be your luck you come on a busy day with item(s) in tow. I think there were only two or 3 tables that fit 4 people. Everything else were 2 person seating or the bar seating. You have been warned coming from a mother of 4.

Anyway, I ordered the sweet cheese us with the truffle fries. I enjoyed my meal. It was pretty good. I actually like their rendition of a philly cheesesteak than the actual philly cheesesteak itself. However, I wouldn't order this to-go. The bread would probably sog up quick and your fries would not taste that great. You must eat here to thoroughly enjoy your food while it is still fresh. Do not attempt to eat here as your first time but take it to go...I'm pretty sure you'll end up disappointed. Then you'll end up typing out an unfair review.

The meat in my sandwich was super tender and the banana and cherry peppers went together perfectly. My one friend had the parmesan sandwich, forgot the actual name, and his wife had the meat flatbread or something like that. 

Her meal look disappointing because it didn't look that big at all. I'm pretty sure she was still hungry afterwards because by the looks of it, think I'd be hungry too. Honestly, after eating my meal I felt as though I was still hungry...but as the night progressed I felt just right. Not full at all, but not starving. But I'm ""little"" so I can't speak the same for all. 

I do want to head back to explore their menu for sure. They do have a menu that leaves you wanting to do just that. I'll probably pick an odd day and time to avoid lines as seen in the reviews. To be honest, though, I don't think the food is worth such a line. If I had to wait and wait and wait just to order my food then worry about where to sit afterwards...I'd give this place 2 or 3 stars just for it not being worth the wait because of the price and perhaps portioning. I haven't explored their menu to really gripe about portioning, but my friend is a pretty bulky guy and he was still hungry. 

I did think it had a cute vibe to it. Love their menu and what they did with the place. But, it felt like it was a little extra dark than necessary. I wish they brightened it up a bit without losing the effect they want. I couldn't really read my menu too well. Which is probably why I hurried and ordered because the astigmatism was kicking in. Lol.  Lousy Night vision was in total effect. 

I would recommend this place for someone to try if they were looking to explore a different kind of menu. Just not so sure what to make of all the hype just yet. After a few visits of trying other menu items will I be able to make such judgment. But tonight as first impression, not convinced. Can't wait to get my mind changed!",0,0,0

""What the?"" I start, watching him look over the 'healthy' options.

""I gotta stay in shape"" he says.

""Ummm..."" I trail off as I look him up and down, his swimmers physique hidden behind 30lbs of good old American excess.

""Hey, round is a shape."" he continues as he orders a double cheeseburger.

Skinny Fats, home of the HAPPY (pre new year, yay!!) and healthy (post new year, boo) menu.  To their credit, the boo menu is tasty.

Straight to it, familiar food.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing over the top.  Solid but not perfect.

The turkey burger (cranburkie) is well made.  Good texture of the burger managing to stay moist with the addition of cranberry and topped with a cranberry yogurt and loads of peppery arugula, semi ripe tomato, and sharp red onion.  OK but desperately needing more salt to bring out the turkey flavor.  The naked Chix (pan roasted chicken breast topped with a mango salsa and sweetened mango basil sauce with a side of cilantro yogurt) is well made.  Well cooked chicken, the salsa and sauce could use more spice heat to balance the mango flavor.  A side of Yummus (rosemary hummus) with it's inherent creamy richness and herbal finish pairs well with the selections.

From the HAPPY menu,  props to the Sweet Cheese Us, a great take on the Philly cheese steak (thin slices of still juicy beef with cherry peppers, deeply caramelized onions, portabello chunks, and a slightly spicy pepper jack, cheddar sauce slathered generously atop).  The Cherry Popper ( 1\/2 lb, juicy, dripping burger topped with cherry peppers, a spiced up slaw, pepper jack, and a dripping fried egg to cool it all down in a sweet bread roll) not far behind.  Messy and simply good eats.

One thing, avoid anything ""truffle"" (ie truffle fries).  Synthetic truffle oil.  Ack.

All told, cool concept and vibe designed to hide one's foodie intercessions.  Hey, no one's telling on you.",15,12,13

It was one thing or another that delayed me trying this place but finally I made it! Glad I did too! Lunch hour here is crazy busy! Good thing Mel & Terri R was able to snag a table for us since they got there early.

Everything off the Skinny \/Healthy and Happy\/Fats side sounded really good! I ended up getting two entrees! Bonjour Brulee a breakfast entree and Beets by Goat a salad entree off the ""Healthy"" menu side.

I chose the Skinny side not because it was the healthier choices but because I love goat cheese and arugula incorporated in my salads and beets too!  And when the Bonjour Brulee french toast topped with fresh berries, drizzled in agave was presented to me, I was impressed! So I had no regrets with my choices! Both salad and french toast were delicious! It also came with two silver dollar turkey sausage patties which I skipped.  I took a bite and didn't like it anyways. So I can do without that. The juices and shakes sounded good but were on the pricier side. As much as some of the entrees. So I can do without that too.

It's a fast casual restaurant. Place your order at the counter and they'll bring it to you when it's ready. I don't think the dining area is small for the space it's in. There's enough tables. It's just this place is so popular! That's a good thing though right?? The turnaround for a table here can be a while during the lunch hours then again, it's busy all day!

The line to order during the time I was there was out the door long! So I highly suggest you call or use the app you can get for your phone to place your order and pickup will be quicker. Yelp app or online has a place also where you can order for delivery or pickup!

Parking wasn't really a problem, that's if you park further away from their store front and don't mind walking a little more. 

Location in an industrial setting is pretty innovative if you ask me. What a great idea for a start up business, it's probably more cost effective to lease space here. I so would find it a bonus having a restaurant nearby my workplace. It wasn't too hard to find the place for me. Your visual cue is (NB on Dean Martin) the  ""Post Commerce"" sign on the corner of the industrial lot Skinnyfats is located. If your SB on Dean Martin, it's just past the railroad track crossing. Entrance to Skinnyfats is facing I-15.

From what I noticed all the people who were on their lunch hour, no one seemed to mind waiting for their food, waiting in line, or waitng for table or waiting at all! Must be they've ate from the ""happy"" side of the menu alot. Just know there's a wait, but the food is worth it!",8,4,9

It took us a while to find the place because the sign isn't too big and it looks like a little hole in the wall. We passed by it twice until I realized that it was the place! Also felt kind of stupid because there was a HUGE billboard sign that said ""SkinnyFATS is here""! 

I was actually surprised because I didn't take the time to read previous reviews and only looked at pictures of the burgers rather than the inside\/outside decor. The place is small! Felt very cozy in there, and it was a bit packed when a got there with a few seats by the window open and two tables. As soon as you walk in the line begins, and you place your order and then sit wherever you like. 

I never understood why it was called SkinnyFATS until I looked at the menu and saw that one side was for those who wanna go a healthier route and another side for those with no limitations! There were two employees at the front and one acknowledged me and gave me an insight of the menu and what they had which was good! The girl taking my order was nice and helped me choose what to order\/what would be the better option! 

I ordered the cherry popper burger with truffle fries for my uncle and I got the classic burger with truffle fries and two drinks for us. The food was served to us shortly after.

If you're going to get a side, please get the truffle fries. They are AMAZING! The best I've ever had. Most restaurants will put too much truffle to a point where it overpowers it and you don't even taste the potatoes but these were perfect. The burger was just as amazing as the fries!! I wanted to buy a bottle of the chipotle ketchup but it slipped my mind because I was too focused on how good my food was.

Hidden little gem, surrounded by businesses so I suppose it made sense. Its relatively small... Very colorful decor with dim and comfortable lighting. This place was BUSY, way too small for the customer base... Definitely not enough seating. However, my boyfriend snagged a table as soon as we walked in... YES!! Since it was our first time here, we were a little confused about how to order. There was a server serving the food and a counter with a register. We weren't sure who to order from... After asking, we figured out how to order: first from the counter and then the server drops the food. 

The menu is a simple front to back menu. Separated: a healthy side and a happy side. We both ordered from the healthy side:) my boyfriend ordered the chicken and protein waffle with sugar free syrup, it looked pretty darn good. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower( small portion maybe four and a half whole pieces of cauliflower) for us to share. It was spicy and delicious. I ordered the portobello sandwich made vegan with no sauce and a side of rosemary hummus. It was so delicious!! Perfect amount of veggies and the bread was toasty and not soggy. The side of sweet potato fries were suppose to come out with truffle oil, they didn't but they charged us for it. My side of hummus was also forgotten and we were charged. Other than the cramped seating and a few forgotten items, this place was great.

There were a lot of people in line but we didn't know what to do or how to order. We didn't know and nowhere did they tell us that you line up to order and then they bring the food to you. I think something like a sign at the top or like some tape on the floor would give a better indication of what to do.

The service was great! The workers would ask what we wanted to drink before we got to the front of the cashier so it would speed up the process since it was a long line.

I ordered the Pigzza. Now, reading what it said made me want to get it even though it was early in the morning and I didn't want to start my day off with something too heavy. However, I wasn't too high on any of the other dishes they had so I decided to get it. The pizza itself was a little doughy; the toppings were good but it was just smaller than I thought. It's in the shareable section so I guess I shouldn't have expected too much but the cashier said it could be a meal itself (so I guess I was just really hungry?). Maybe I should've gotten a burger or something that would get me full.

My husband and I went there for The Green Mile Juice (love, order when we eat there) at 9:00 am. I waited in the car while he ordered my drink.  My husband ordered The Green MILE with NO APPLE because I'm highly allergic to fruit (hospitalized twice). He told the girl taking his order I have a apple allergy.  Since, there is no other fruit listed in the drink, he did not give her a list of all of the fruits I am allergic to. He gave me the drink, but as soon as I took a sip I knew there was fruit in it. He took it back and explained my fruit allergies to the girl taking the order again.  The girl who made my drink came out of the back and took it upon herself state, ""There's no apple in it. I'm a culinary genius, I put in oranges and syrup in it."" Then, I went into the restaurant and explained, again, that I am allergic to fruit. She just gave me a blank stair and said, ""So you want only vegetables?"" I replied, ""That's what I ordered, right?""  Ultimately, the manager refunded our purchase and the drink was made correctly.  Every other time I ordered this drink, it was made without fruit.  Thankfully, I did not have an allergic reaction from taking a sip of the drink. People with food allergies know how serious an issue this could have been.  Employees in the food industry need to pay more attention to these issues and not change menu items on a whim. We enjoy eating here and are happy that steps were made to correct this issue.

Execution is a completely different story. 
We were excited about the menu and ordered quite an array of items. We ordered a burger and truffle fries, Greek pizza, ahi sirachi taco, hot-mame, and strawberry lemonade. 
Let's start by saying I understand that this is a new place... Get it. I understand that they didn't anticipate such traffic... Get it. 
So.... The key is to make your guest who will be visibly irritated at the chaos & lack of uniformity feel important and happy. That's not happening. The employees are just as confused as the people arriving!!!
We walked in never having been here. WE see that it's crowded... Assume we have to wait, which is fine. The guy at the front wants to tell me about the menu.... I'm not dense or stupid.... Ill figure the menu out. What I would like you to do is answer how I'm to proceed with my 2 year old son and 1 year old nephew and two other members of my party. He tells me there is no list to put our names down on and it's first come first serve. The problem with that idea is that there was already a line out the door and people standing around waiting for tables...... Let's put it this way, it's just a shit fest. The Blind leading the blind. 
Yeah you can take it to go..... BUT GO WHERE?!?? The place is on a desolate road near the strip. 
They get a two because the food was good. 
The other three stars they can get if I ever decide to come back to this place after they work the kinks out and get their shit together.....oh & after I visit every other restaurant that we'd like to in Vegas..... You know... Where they have seats and a staff. Not just food and a register. 

The highlight was the strawberry lemonade... Which for the other two people with me was horrible, for me was great bc it wasn't sweet and literally tasted like strawberry, lemon, and water. 

**side note: while there they asked a couple to move to the bar bc they were taking up seats at a table for a bigger party...... And people were at the ALREADY busy register asking for boxes and trying to correct wrong orders. ...... A MESS!",0,1,0

They have many healthier options, as well as things similar to chicken and waffles. Now I've been to Roscoe's out in LA, and they have great chicken and waffles, but these guys offer a comparable dish.

Service was amazing! Decor was phenomenal. All their advertising was top notch too. Hands down, one of the better restaurants I've been to this year.

They are reasonably priced. I ordered the philly steak sandwich, $12 (it was the most expensive thing on the menu). Chix on Broadway sandwich for my wife, $9. Pizza for our daughter, $9. Our friend ordered the Cranberry Turkey burger, it was around $9. We all finished everything, but were stuffed. Everything was great.

Only downside is they are kind of out of the way. But they do cater, and they do deliver to nearby areas. Still worth a trip though, just to check out the spot.

Supposedly they're expanding to near Boca park and also near the downtown area. If you get a chance, check them out.",1,0,1

Noticing this, we got permission from a kind man to put our number token down on his table as he and his family finished up their food. I was a little bit outraged when someone who'd ordered after us tried to sit down at that table immediately after the family left.

Food is alright. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicka Wafa Dopolis, my mom and brother each got the Wake N Bacon, and I picked out the Cluck Moo. I wish I'd looked for actual photos first, since I would've picked something else. It was good but I preferred the Wake N Bacon's flavor profile. Cluck Moo is very standard breakfast fare, nothing terribly unique about it.

We also shared the Balls 2.0 - which I didn't realize were literally the number of risotto balls... They were quite tasty though! I'd get that one again for sure.

Good food? Yes. Would I brave the masses trying to fight for a table again? Don't think so.",1,1,0

I initially thought the menu would only include uber-healthy, vegan type stuff, so imagine my surprise when I saw that not only did it have healthy offerings, but things to satisfy all of our inner fat boys and girls!

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese (I forget the official name of it) along with sweet potato fries. That sandwich was like heaven! The chicken was fresh, juicy, tender and flavorful. Not overly breaded, hot and  just delicious. The bun was amazing- soft and filling. And the fries were perfect as well. I sampled a spicy chicken and rice dish (it had pineapples and peppers) and that was great too! Really flavorful and again, very fresh tasting.

After feeling like an absolute fatty from eating at a buffet last night, I decided to order from the skinny side. My friend went for the fat side. I got a fresh morning sandwich and truffle fries. My friend got a burger Benedict with truffle fries. We shared a 32oz shake with banana, strawberry, frozen yogurt and of course, Nutella. 

Fresh Morning Sandwich:
Turkey bacon, egg whites, saut√©ed spinach, tomato, agave tomato ketchup on a multigrain kaiser roll, and a side of fruit. I had no guilt eating this sandwich but it's quite filling that I had to take half of it home. Good thing it already comes sliced in half. Everything in this sandwich tasted fresh. I love egg whites and find egg yolks disgusting so I love egg white sammies. The kaiser roll was a tad bit dry though. 4\/5

Truffle Fries:
Skinny fries with chopped parsley and drizzled with truffle oil. Their version is pretty good. Some were a bit soggy. 4\/5

Create-Your-Own Shake:
We chose banana, strawberry, Nutella and frozen yogurt with soy milk. A yummy shake with less guilt. I appreciate having a choice of 2% milk or soy milk since I'm lactose intolerant. Sharing might not have been a wise choice for us. I had to give Shawn the evil eye so I could get a sip. The cup it comes in is pretty cool. There's a clear part so you can see how much smoothie you still have left. 5\/5

As for the burger, I guess you'll have to read my friend's review when he gets to it since I wanted to be good and just stick with my healthy sandwich.

They have environment-friendly cups for their citrus cucumber water. Sit at the bar so you could charge your phone or other gadgets. This was a big plus in my book. The only not-so-positive comment I have is that my fries and our shake didn't come with the rest of our food.",10,6,6

There are two doors by the entrance.  One is glass and the other has their logo on it.  Go through the glass doors.  The other one leads you into their kitchen area.  Im guessing they probably don't want me back there.  Once you've chosen the correct door, it takes you into their dining area.  It is quite small.  Smaller than many places for dining in.  The employees are very good at cleaning the table off right away as soon as someone leaves.  

Service here was great.  The two girls taking orders were very polite and friendly.  The others who were brining out the meals were also very kind in making sure you had everything you needed.  Gold stars for the employees here!

They have a great variety of options on their menu.  Breakfast, healthy menu and happy menu.  There are also many kinds of healthy juices to try.  So I went with the TBLT off of the healthy menu.  Just like a regular BLT but with turkey bacon and whole grain bread.  Of course I had to try their sweet potato fries on the side.  I was completely happy with the healthy sandwich!  They certainly did not skimp on the turkey bacon.  It was so delicious especially with their awesome fries.  The fries were brought out in a bowl.  I had enough to share with my friend!

They have a healthy side and a fatty side. My friend and I have been hearing a lot about this place and been dying to find a time to try it one day. 

Luckily, our first chance as at a Yelp charity event where SkinnyFats participated and offered a few items on their menu as samples. Those samples were enough to make us want to go try the real place even more. Everything was so good ! Samples of chix on broadway sliders on hawaiian sweet bread, ahi tacos, two juices, and other things. 

Chance finally came when two friends from Cali came into town and we were lookin for a lunch place. To my surprise, the place was actually quite small. I could almost swear i saw pictures, somewhere, where it showed a bigger place. i must be dreaming .... When we came, it was lunch time and was packed, but luckily, by the time we ordered, two tables cleared out and we got a place to sit. 

As with most foodies, each get a different thing, and try each others food, and so we did...

Phatty Philly w\/ Truffle Fries - This was what i had ordered. Steak, sauteed onions, peppers, portobello mushrooms, blue cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie bun. The ABSOLUTE FIRST THING you notice after taking a bite, ""OH MY GOD THATS A LOT OF BLUE CHEESE!!!"" wow what a punch in the face with the strong blue cheese sauce. I didnt expect it to be that strong. It actually covers a lot of the other ingredients flavors. Its great if you are a blue cheese lover, but being someone who not exactly like it nor do i hate it, it was surprising. Aside from that, the steak was super tender. great quality meat, juicy, and cooked to perfection. Next time, i would ask for some grilled onions and jalepenos too and switch out the blue cheese for something lighter like a provolone. 

The fries were nice and crispy. Finally a place that doesnt drench their fries in truffle oil. Its still noticeable but it doesnt kick you in the mouth. EAT IT WITH THE JALEPENO KETCHUP ! delicious ! 

Chix on Broadway - One of the things tried before, and fell in love with (at the yelp event). Breaded chicken breast on a brioche bun with cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion, and lemon aioli. Though bun is different, the sandwich is still as amazing as the sampler. One of the very few places who can actually cook a chicken breast and still keep it tender and juicy ! Lemon aioli sauce gives it a bright flavor melding the entire sandwich together. For some odd reason, red onions were more spicy than sweet. My friend took them out. She wasnt a fan on bacon either. MUST TRY ! 

Cheeseburger Benedict - 1\/2 pound angus buger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, and a fried egg. This was what my friend ordered. I'm not a fan of burgers but apparently the burger was so huge, it fell apart while he was eating. He pretty much went fork & knife for the rest of the burger. At least the person who ordered it was happy? XD

Drunken Gypsy Toast - Came here after dinner with my friend who thought this place had more desserts. Apparently she saw the sunday sundaes. Oops? We shared this gypsy toast as a dessert. Topped with fresh cut fruit (strawberries, bananas, and blueberries), whipped cream, a side of syrup, and a few things of bacon. Her nor i being a fan of bacon, that immediately went to another friend. Upon first glance, the toast reminded me of the McD's hotcakes. just by the sheer shape and look. The toast was nice and thick but fluffy. Good breakfast item (as what it was designed for) lol o well. still good nonetheless. 

Overall, great place in an awkward location yet still so busy, and popular. Would love to come back to try other things, like the acai bowl !",2,0,1

I like how they break it down in the setup of the menu also. It's very easy to see which route you wanna take, healthy or happy. The names of the food items are very witty and cool.
Went with the Sweet Cheese Us without onions. It was basically a glorified cheese steak sandwich, which was made to perfection. The meat was cooked well and the toppings and cheese were complimented nicely. Opted for a macadamia cookie for the side which was good.
My wife went with the Mega Club sandwich which she said was very good. It was very big and filling.
The ambience of the place was cool.  The workers were very nice and the girl that took our order was personable. I like that the location is off the strip which makes it easy to get to, and there is plenty of parking.
My only knock on the place is that it is a rather small restaurant. There was a bit of a line when we got there,  and seating is rather limited. Larger parties would definitely have trouble finding seats. We ended up getting our food to-go for this reason,  which wasn't a huge deal but it would have been nice to eat there.",1,0,0

The menu at Skinnyfats is divided into Happy Eats and Healthy Eats.  So of course I looked immediately at the happy side, skipping the healthy side, and I ordered their Bonjour Brul√©e, which the menu describes as ""9 grain bread dipped in our egg white signature cr√®me brul√©e mixture, pan fried and drizzled with agave nectar.""  It comes with three slices of applewood smoked bacon.  There was no whipped cream as Nelson had, but it really is not needed.

You order at the counter, sit anywhere, and then one of the nicest young women brings your coffee or other drink and food to your table.  The French toast was wonderful. The agave syrup was only needed a tiny bit, and the fresh berries were the perfect topping.  The coffee was good.

While waiting, I took a bunch of photos and just enjoyed the place.  Whoever came up with the theme and the decorations was very creative and imaginative.  I want to use the word cute, but I don't like using the word cute in general.

This is an out of the way place but I can see where they would do a good business from all the businesses in the area.  I wlll be back.  This is a place to try over.  Lunch next time!  This is a place to bring out of town guests for breakfast.  They'll love it.

What is SkinnyFATS? Plenty of healthy options available on the left side of the menu: vegan, non GMO, and protein based. Happy options on the right side - sandwiches, burgers, and more. 

We arrived early Saturday morning around 10am, right before the rush. My sister and I were able to snag the last open table, thank goodness!

What we ordered: 

Fresh Juice - Garden Treat : Carrot, Beet, Cucumber, Agave, Banana, and Froyo - 4 stars

Berry Strong : Protein Waffle, Berries, Strawberry Jam, Orange Agave, and Turkey Bacon - Waffle definitely filled us up, but lacking in syrup, a little too dry - 3.5 stars

Sweet Cheese Us - NY Strip, Pepper Marmalade, Carmelized Onions, Pepper Jack, Portobello, Cheddar Sauce, on a Hoagie. Nothing short of AMAZINGGGG, our Philly Cheese Steak was extremely flavorful and spicy! - 4.5 stars

At the peak of their business while we were there, people were sitting on the curb outside eating out of ""to go"" boxes, eating in their car and eating whilst stand up in the restaurant.

My order was actually forgot about because me and my friend sat outside at their bench, due to no seating inside. It roughly took them 40 minutes to figure this out too, haha. It's cool though, they comped it and ended up getting a free burger for it! 

I tried the cheeseburger benedict and truffle fries, good presentation and pretty good taste..just lacking a bit of flavor.

I walked in at noon, not expecting much of a crowd based on the location, to find the lunch rush in full swing. The interior design is very vibrant, with fun painted walls and many unique touches. After reading over the many enticing menu options, I was ready to place my order at the counter. I went with the Skinny Bowl with a side of fat in the form of truffle fries. It was a perfect combo.

Both items were delivered to my table after a few minutes. The Skinny Bowl was the best acai bowl I've ever tasted, with granola, strawberries, bananas, dried cranberries, and agave syrup. The acai was a soft sorbet texture that had a nice, light citrus flavor to it. I've had this item at other places and felt like it was blended with too much banana, or had too much of a baby food texture. My daughter loved this acai bowl, too.


The truffle fries looked pretty ordinary, but they had great flavor. I'd never seen Heinz Balsamic Ketchup before, so that was a nice touch on my table. I was too distracted by the delicious food in front of me (and keeping my 11 month old entertained) to even realize that the long-haired man pictured on the Skinnyfats menu eating a burger was seated at a table just to my right, wearing the same purple Abraham Lincoln t-shirt featured in his photo.

The verdict. A big piece of chicken on the yummiest bun with some truffle fries.

I wanted to also try a full version of Liquid Defense pressed juice.  OMG, so good. ORANGE, CARROT, APPLE, LEMON, LIME, BASIL and 231 calories. Yes, the price of $7.95 is not for the faint of heart.  But, man, oh man, it is so good.  I should have gotten the large and not the medium.  I wanted to lick the bottom of the glass.",2,3,3

Five stars because the smoke in the bowl had amazing flavor, it was similar taste to provencale sauce and nice tender chicken. The naked chix was very similar but milder and had plenty of chicken but the cauliflower rice.

Excellent!  

My eldest sister, who seems to know all the right places to eat and where to go  in her hometown, tells me that we are having lunch at SkinnyFats. I roll my eyes because I incorrectly conjure up in my mind a so-hip it hurts trendy spot where the food is terrible and the service is awful. Boy, was I wrong. 

The food is EXCELLENT. I've been here twice now, and man, the food is EXCELLENT!  Coffee is strong. The small space and d√©cor... cool. Service is Xtra friendly.  And,the food is EXCELLENT! 

Be prepared to wait.   
The place can get very busy. 

So far, my favorite is the seared teriyaki tuna sandwich. Tender  tuna, greens with citrus sauce, fresh tomato slices & spinach, perfectly held together on toasted sesame-grain toast. EXCELLENT! The fries are good too.

My coworker is also health-conscious and she came upon this place and really persuaded me to try it out. After the first visit, I knew I was going to come back multiple times (kind of a random place for it to be on Dean Martin so it looks like they're probably big on word-of-mouth advertising). The ambiance is nice and it's kind of small so if they're really busy you'll probably be without a seat. I wouldn't recommend big groups. Maybe a group of 4 or less would be perfect.

1st visit was mostly for dessert BUT then I realized they don't really have dessert because all the dessert-related pictures on Instagram are for their Sunday Sundae specials.
I ended up getting a kid's sized order of Adventure Juice (juiced spinach, orange, and lemon, blended with strawberries, bananas, and frozen yogurt or ice cream) which was actually pretty yummy. I tried it with ice cream.

The Drunken Gypsy Toast $7.75 is an SF Cr√®me brul√©ed Brioche, berries, bananas, whipped cream & syrup w\/Applewood bacon and that was also really yummy. I liked the softness of the brioche toast and all the berries and bananas was nice to go with it. I was just pleasantly surprised with both things. Sometimes you come to a place and you're like eh, maybe I'll come back, but this one is a for sure.

It's always a plus to go out to eat and have delicious healthy options. For the ones that don't want to be ""healthy,"" you can order from their ""happy"" menu. I am definitely going to try a lot of their healthy-side menu options, though. They all look promising. 

Also, check out their Instagram for new pictures of different dishes because it may not sound good on paper but it looks so damn good.

I will be back with an updated review :).",2,0,0

I went in to try Skinnyfats in person last week with a coworker. It is a small room, with crowded seating. There was a line almost out the door, and there seemed to be a lack of organization with regard to people ordering food versus people picking up to go orders. 

After ordering and taking a seat at a table, we had what seemed like an excessive wait for our food, all of which came out at different times. I always hate eating while the person that is with me is still waiting for their meal... I also hate when my food is cold because I waited for my fellow diner to get their meal. 

All of this aside, the food was good. I once again had the skinny bowl, which was less runny this time around. I also had a Little Gobbler which was excellent. On the way out, I made sure to grab a menu.

Fast forward 1 week. We were all set to place a delivery order with Skinnyfats when I noticed that many of the items we wanted were listed at higher prices than the paper menu we had picked up just one week prior. Examples:

Mr.Green cold pressed juice was $7.50 last week. It is now $9.50. (All juices went up $2)
Skinny Bowl was $8.75 last week. It is now $9.75.
Flat Chix & Greens was $8 last week. It is now $9.50.

What I noticed, and was frustrated about regarding these prices increases, is that there are some items on the menu that have notes indicating that ingredients have been added to the dish, however these are NOT the items with higher prices. For example, the Drunken Gypsy Toast is the same price it was before, however it now comes with berries and bananas on top. The wrap my co-worker had a week ago is the same price, but it now has rice added to it. 

I'd understand raising the prices on items because the ingredients changed, but that does not appear to be what is happening here. It also does not appear that all menu items containing specific ingredients were raised in price, which, again, would be understandable. Instead it appears Skinnyfats just raised the prices on items at random. 

Maybe I am being nitpicky, maybe it's harsh to dock a business a star over a few bucks... But I can not honestly say I am a big fan of Skinnyfats after 2 less-then-amazing experiences and these seemingly random price hikes. A-OK is a more accurate description of how I feel about this business.",14,3,4

After seeing a Facebook friend continually post pics from Skinny Fats, I knew I had to try it.  I knew the restaurant was small, but decided to be brave, and not only took my family of four on a Friday night, but an additional family of four as well.  We arrived at 5:30; early enough to get a table configurated for the 8 of us and the waiter couldn't have been any nicer or accommodating about it.  It is very small, but has such a cool vibe to it!  The decor is perfect and it really speaks to whole feel you get there.  Plus, it was super clean, including the bathrooms, which is always appreciated with kids!

We were ordering for four children and four adults, and as first timers had no idea what we were doing.  The staff was SO nice and helpful with everything, and super welcoming!  We all managed to order (there's a secret menu too!), and waited anxiously while ogling over the super cute salt shaker, and choices of ketchups at every table.

I got the cranberry turkey sandwich on the ""skinny"" side of the menu, and balanced it out with the truffle fries.  It was all super good... Fries were amazing!  My husband got the chicken sandwich with the Asian coleslaw.  Sandwich was great (on a brioche bun!), and the coleslaw... Oh my.  Best I have EVER had.  I seriously considered asking for an order of it to take home!  Other items ordered and loved were the sweet potato fries and BLT sandwich.  The kids all got the chicken fingers and root beer floats... They were in heaven.  

As far as drinks go, they have a great variety of floats, shakes and cold pressed juices.  Yummy fruit infused water is also an option.  And, we couldn't leave without buying some huge cookies from the pastry case!

By the time we left around 6:40, it was packed.  I can see why!  We all can't wait to go back for breakfast!  And lunch, and dinner, and breakfast again, etc. ; ). As a Vegas native, I'm SO excited to see a place like this pop up in town and wish them continued success!",2,0,1

The concept behind SkinnyFats is that they offer a menu of both things that could be considered healthy (skinny)  or happy (fat)... or both!  

This location is quite small with limited seating though and because of the popularity of this place, it's almost always packed.   However, once seated, the food is delicious, and many of my friends I've brought here all agree.

Just a few suggestions of foods, there's so much good stuff to try:

Tu-Nuts is to-die-for.   Spicy ahi tuna & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w\/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli.  So refreshing and delicious yet you don't feel like you ate too much.  

REDiculous - Red velvet waffle, cream cheese frosting, berries & chocolate w\/ applewood bacon - This is for those that just love dessert (who doesn't?)

Berry the Steak - Flatbread w\/shaved NY strip, feta, goat cheese, arugula, blackberries & balsamic.  The variety of food here is so vast.  There's something for everyone. 

There has really been nothing I've ordered that wasn't really good.  Come with a few people and try and share a few things!  I guarantee it that you'll love all their offerings.

Tip:  On Sundays, they offer their always different Sunday Sundae.   Just look at the photos here on Yelp.  They are crazy, in a good way!

Minus one for being overcrowded to the point that people are pressed against each other waiting to order, get food or find a seat in this  tiny place.
Also another minus is the food was cold when it was brought out and the famous chicken burger which was the best tasting item we ordered until we saw it was still partially raw, a HUGE no no especially since it was my son eating it and I had to tell him he could not finish it once I saw.
I did really like how friendly the service was, but waiting over half an hour for cold food was sad.
Also the portions are really small, I should have ordered more, but the prices at least to me reflected the portions would be larger than small plate bites.
The brussel sprouts were great, but very small portion, same with the fish taco.
Being that they fried the shell to order, it was soggy and cold, cold fish, also not that great.
The sauce that came on it, was fantastic, I see SO much potential!

Staff\/service is awesome, menu is diverse and very neat, overall concept is very cool, and of course the food is great!

My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick place to eat that wouldn't be out of our way as we were leaving Vegas. We happened to find this place without any idea of what to expect other than the fact that it seemed to have some breakfast\/lunch options. I am so happy we dropped by. 

I love the whole concept and theme that skinnyFATS has going on. The way the menu is spread out is really cool - you have a ""healthy"" side and a ""happy"" side. The healthy side includes calorie information with lower calorie options and the happy side includes items that you'll want to indulge in. If you look at the two items side by side, they are very similar options (i.e. a low cal breakfast burrito vs a more caloric breakfast burrito). I got the wrap supastar and it was really good. My boyfriend had the steak eyes. Let me tell you, that gravy was delicious!

Why are you only located in Vegas!!! Pleaseee open more locations. 
In the meantime, I'll have to make a stop here every time I'm in town!",0,0,0

When we decided to make a trip to Vegas from California we decided, this is the place to go! The moment we arrived into the strip area, we came to try this place. The location is kind of weird. It's away from the strip by 10 minutes or so, and it's not in a plaza. This place is located in an area filled with industrial and commercial buildings. There's plenty of parking and service is very fast!! You can look at all their food on Instagram as they like to showcase their food there. 

The line was not long, the restaurant is a bit small so when waiting for a table it can be kind of long. You take your own table so you have to fight and compete. I remember when we came here, someone argued with my friend about a table. Anyways, they're portions are HUGE!!! We ended up taking everything to go and eating it in the middle of the night after clubbing. I ordered their fried chicken sandwich because when I went up to the cashier and asked for recommendations she said this one would really fill me up. The price is a bit higher, but the portion is CRAZY. My friends order a burrito and burger and they were all HUGE!!! The truffle fries here are also AMAZINg! I would recommend ordering different things with friends and sharing to try it all!! They also have plenty of shakes and smoothies to try!

Saw this resto on Yelp and Instagram. Very appealing pictures but they don't do the food justice.  Was with a group so was able to try a few different things on the menu. Ordered from the healthy AND the happy sides :)

*Happy Mess: bf says it's like a healthier version of carne asada fries
*Chix on Broadway: chicken was juicy and the batter wasn't greasy, plus!
*Phatty Philly: tender meat and succulent portobello
*Burger Benedict: wow! the egg was the ""cherry on top""
*Ahi Srirachi: loved the freshness of these fish tacos!

For drinks, gf got the How Now Brown Cow (twist on root beer float)... and I got the Jazz Hands (Sprite and mangoes). There were cut up strawberries and mangoes, in our shakes, respectively. We both agreed we liked the weird fizz feeling when chomping into the soaked up fruits =P

Basically, you have the ""Skinny"" side which is healthy of course then the ""fat"" side which is the complete opposite of the skinny side. OH be on the eye we passed it twice, we suck, we were expecting a colorful pop out sign and that's not what it was....

Kind of like a doppelg√§nger style menu.
From the Skinny side I got the Ahi Srirachi taco, which had seared tuna, some kind of slaw, mango pico all on a soft flour tortilla. It was VERY flavorful and VERY messy!! 

Also, I ordered, Ahi Taco-San, from the Fat side. It was tempura ahi with slaw, avocado aioli, also with mango pico, served in a hard shell taco. It was equally as flavorful. 

I think I prefer the Ahi Srircahi taco most because I like soft tortilla's over hard. OH and the tacos are I think are pretty big, I think 2-3 would be fine for women to be full and men would be good with 3-6.

Chris got the Phatty Philly which had delicious saut√©ed portobello mushrooms, onions, and peppers, grilled TENDER filet mignon, and SLICES of blue cheese all served on a toasted hoagie roll. 
Now I HATE blue cheese so I just picked some meat and portobellos off and tried them and OMG were they tasty!! I would get this without the cheese! 

Our friend got the Chix on Broadway. It was a freshly pounded out chicken breast breaded to order, which I appreciated, on a brioche roll with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, and cheese. He liked it and it was HUGE, plenty to share. I tried a bite and they flavor was there however with the crispy chicken, crunchy bacon, and the toasted roll it hurt my mouth and I felt it was dry. 

Both Chris and our friend got truffle fries, they are shoestring style. I love that you can taste the truffles. The total for all 3 of us was $47, which included 3 sodas.

I drove by this place on my way home from another favorite place on the area and decided to stop for breakfast. The outside doesn't look much like a restaurant, you really need to know what your looking for, but since I had read about it on yelp, I knew it was there. The place is small about the size of your average subway shop but nicely designed, modern tables, modern chairs and newly designed classic meals. The menu features healthy and not so healthy options so there's surely something on the menu for everyone, it seems that we were there during fat hour. We ordered the phatty Philly with truffle fries (good) and the chicken & waffles from the secret menu  (good)  but the (wow) factor was missing. Still, a good meal for the price. Service was wonderful everyone here is very attentive and very friendly, if they were any more friendlier they'll be competing with the neighboring business. 
This is a good concept  and I'm glad someone noticed that there are two kinds of people.....yelpers and non yelpers.

What a concept, SkinnyFats. It's like the angel on one shoulder telling you to eat a salad or some ahi tuna but that devil on the other side is like ""NO, CHOCOLATE BANANA PANCAKES, NOW!!!"" I fairly waited to write this review til I had dined off both the skinny, and the fat side of the menu. Although the skinny side is excellent and has tons of options of just about everything the fat side does, I still prefer the fat side. Even with the salads! The Aphrodite wedgie was freaking amazing! They recommend add tuna for protein but I added avocado instead. Still great. I'd pass on the truffle fries again, but my boyfriend liked them. He got the Philly that comes with huge portobellos, mushroom heaven! My second visit I had the cheeseburger Benedict and it was a solid, home cooked burger with fresh veggies and egg. It exceeded my expectations actually. They also offer a cucumber water, love when places do that! 
There are also skinny and fat juices, shakes, and floats. Everything from a hangover helper, to a orange fanta float. Honestly, there are no way the creators of this menu weren't potheads. Creativity at its finest put into action. Well done. 
The only downside is parking your car, then parking your butt. Finding parking is rough, then getting food and dining in, even harder. Especially during lunch hour. If you do find a spot, there are people lingering over you, waiting for you to get up. I'm thinking outdoor dining in this area may be prohibited but would be a great idea if allowed. 
Other than that really nothing bad to say. I have also heard they have a secret menu and daily specials.

i got the ""healthy"" cranburkey w a ""happy"" side of slaw chee. the turkey burger on its own was decent, but adding the slaw chee to the burger made it really great. all the flavors meshed really well together. 

my friend went with chix on broadway w sweet potato fries - basically a fried chicken blt. it was good, but nothing exceptional. if you have a big appetite this would be good for you - i don't think i've ever seen such a big chicken breast before. the fries reputation on yelp was exaggerated a little imo - they were typical sweet potato fries. 

overall i liked skinnyfats, and would go back if i'm in the area. my one complaint is that since they're saying certain things are healthy, they really need to back it up with nutritional values at least on their website if not the menus. 

the cranburkey was definitely healthier than the fried chicken sandwich, but by how much? it was regular ground turkey, not turkey breast, so it wasn't exactly low in fat or calories. it was also a pretty big honey wheat bun - so i'm guessing probably a couple hundred calories for the bun alone? i'm not a calorie counter obviously, but it would be nice to have a little more info since ""healthy"" can be pretty subjective",7,4,7

Glad to say, it is a solid place to grab some grub!  Is it GREAT?  I'd say no, but it is GOOD!

I went with the Burger Benedict ($10.50): 1\/2lb Angus, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickle, Avocado, Fried Egg, Skinny Fats Sauce and Truffle Fries. Burger was juicy and messy. Good taste overall, but I couldn't really taste the SkinnyFats sauce and nothing really EXCITED me about the burger.  Still good and big portions, but being a burger LOVER myself, I don't think I would order it again.

The fries were good, some were very truffle fragrant, and others were a little tame.  But considering the price of admission, they are a GREAT choice of a side, and I would order these every time I am here!

Also tried the Fresh Morning Sandwich ($8): Egg Whites, Sauteed Spinach, Turkey Bacon, Sliced Tomato, Agave Tomato Ketchup, Multigrain Kaiser Roll, and Fresh Fruit. Tasted HEALTHY to me lol...good, but Cathy enjoyed it.  Might fit the bill if you are looking for guilt-free food.

And to drink, we tried a 32oz ""Create Your Own"" Shake ($8.50): Strawberry, Banana, Frozen Yogurt, Soy Milk, and Double Nutella. For having double nutella, I couldn't really taste it, but the strawberry\/banana was blended smooth and had a nice taste overall.  Drinks felt a little expensive here, so we shared a large one for a better deal.

I'm sure I will be back at some point :)

The hot-mame was sweet and slightly spicy. It came with a soy looking sauce on the side, but we didn't use it because they were great as is!

My hubby got the Burger Benedict, which was also really good (also obviously on the happy side). His side was truffle fries, but he wished the truffle flavor was more pronounced.

It was busy when we got there, but luckily we got the last table.

Ordered tonight was the more cow bowl (happy side) which looked good and had nice pieces of tender beef. The slob cob was good but the ranch dressing is the best part.
Truffle fries were ok. Cool mame (ranch edamame) was different and nice.
Best part was the Chicken & Waffle. Wow! All white meat perfectly breaded and seasoned atop a waffle doused in syrup. Even my wife who does not normally like fried chicken (I know, what's wrong with her right?), couldn't keep her fork off my chicken & waffles. She needs to get her own next time!

When I finally found this place nestled in the middle of a non-descript business center located down the street from the Hustler strip club, I happily jumped out of my rental car and headed inside.

I found the uniqueness of this place appealing.  You can either order unhealthy food or healthy food.  The healthy side also had juice blends to choose from so I was very excited to get a juice with a meal of boneless wings and fries.  Now that's a win win!

The place is quite small inside with barely any seating during a packed lunch hour.  From the looks of it, there were no men working the front counter which as a guy, I'm not complaining...I wish that happened way more often!  Most of them were friendly and working hard pumping out orders to hungry seated diners.

My meal was decent and I enjoyed my juice blend of ginger, orange, lemon, and some other stuff I don't remember.  It's really not that hard to be healthy in Vegas on vacation as long as you know where to go.  If this place sticks around long enough, then I'll make sure to come back here for another healthy\/unhealthy combo meal.",2,0,2

I had placed an order online to give myself time to pick up food on the way to work. It was just one item off the menu and the order said it would be ready in 25 minutes which is exactly when I arrived. They hadn't even began to make the order upon my arrival and I let them know not to even bother because I didn't have time to wait which is why I placed the order ahead of time. 

Here's where everything turned around. While processing my refund, the cook quickly threw together their ""Smoke in a Bowl"" which isn't what I ordered, but they knew I wouldn't have a chance to eat until after work so they wanted to make sure I had something to eat. On top of the free meal, I received a phone call from I'm guessing the manager, or maybe just an employee, that I have a $20 gift card waiting for me the next time I visit.

It was PACKED on a Tuesday at around noon which was a good sign. Once I got up to the counter (3 ladies had given up and walked out- they were not fans of the ""first come first serve"" way of ordering), I placed my take out order.

My biggest gripe is the obvious. The space is way too small for there crowds, and there is nowhere to wait for your food. I felt like I was either hovering over the people seated and eating or right in the only way in or out of the back of house. It was total chaos in there.

Once I got my food back to the office is was good enough, with the exception of the Truffle Fries. The same style of fry the McDonald's serves (skinny) with WAY too much truffle oil. Not a fan- if I make it back I won't order them again.

Our first night in town, we partied so hard and ate so unhealthily, that I woke up the next morning and immediately typed ""healthy brunch"" into Yelp to find some place around the hotel.  My friends were SO PISSED that I forced them to drive several miles away from the Strip just to eat at SkinnyFats but afterward everyone was so glad that we did!

It is super far from the Strip, for those of you who are in town to party like me, and it is really confusing to find, but if you're looking for somewhere in Vegas that's healthy and priced for normal folks, there is no better spot I've found.

When we walked in we were offered strawberry lemonade, which was absolutely out of this world in its own right.  Beats the hell out of the Freckle Lemonade at Red Robin which is also a favorite of mine.  As I was trying for something healthy to cleanse my body of the impurities I had done to it the night before, I got an acai bowl.  I am obsessed with acai bowls, and this is one of the best I have ever had!  The acai ""yogurt"" was really great tasting, all the fruit very fresh and the granola was delicious.  To be a *little* fat (I was in Vegas, after all), I did get the Gobbler because it looked tasty.  After my cells instantly perked up from my acai bowl, I was perfectly ready for the Gobbler (it's basically a turkey burger with cranberry stuff on it).  It was delicious as well!  I also tried my friend's truffle fries; they're VERY truffley so if you like the truffle taste you'll enjoy, but if you find truffle oil to be too pungent (I think it's an acquired taste) then this may not be up your alley.

I'm definitely coming back here on the way in or out of town whenever I have another debauched weekend in Vegas.  If you have a car, highly recommend.  It looks far but it's really only 10-15 min from the Strip, and the food is so much better than anything you could have in your hotel.",1,1,1

Their variation of the philly sub was sooooo good and it had plenty of cheese which definitely made me happy.  The fries were okay I think I would have preferred trying the sweet potatoes fries. They also had their own variation of ketchup which was neat but I just wanted plain ketchup which wasn't to be found. The caulifire had more of a kick than I expected but very good.  The smoothie was definitely healthy no added sugars which I loved.  Little different then most other smoothies but well blended and good taste.

I ate here a few months back and was not impressed with the food. I ordered one thing from the healthy side and one thing from the happy side. Both items were drenched in thick sauces that overpowered the taste of everything. I was disappointed and said I wouldn't be back. 

Fast forward a few months....
I decided to give this place a shot after seeing a bunch of new photos from various people's Yelp pages. I invited a few friends here for lunch. And since they've never been, I thought it would be fun to try it out. 

Once again, I ordered the Ahi Taco-San. Battered ahi in a crunchy shell. Once again, the sauce was really heavy. I needed 5 napkins for one taco. I also ordered the chicken and waffles since another friend of mine said it was good. The waffle was nice and fluffy and didn't get soggy with the syrup. The chicken had a good crunch outside and was juicy on the inside. However, the breading was a bit salty. I had my friend taste it and she agreed it was a bit salty. 

My friends ordered the BLT and the Phatty Philly. They also agreed that everything was so heavy and drenched in sauce. Neither of them finished their food because it was too much. My friend ordered a cookie without it being heated up. This was a big mistake because it was rock hard. One awesome employee, Rica, replaced the hard cookie with a warm one, which was so much better and softer.

First of all the place is kind of a bit hard to find. It's located in a suite amongst other industrial businesses in a pretty large sized business complex. Typically not a setting you find a popular caf√© in. Parking can get frustrating as well since you have so many other suites that equals to not a lot of parking. 

When you come in, you will see that there is only one register and I would say about 7 to 8 medium tables. If you don't see a line going out the door, then you got lucky and just avoided the lunch\/dinner rush. If you do get stuck in the rush, you better have a decent amount of time allotted not to have anywhere to go any time soon. Remember, you waiting in line, putting your order in, and waiting for your food to come put together equals a lot of patience because all those people that ordered ahead of you are in the same boat. So it takes time for you to get your food since everything is made from scratch.

With that said, I ordered the Burger Benedict, which has a half pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado, fried egg, and special SkinnyFats sauce. It was also accompanied by a side of truffle fries, which was a large enough portion to share with another. The fries were good with the two different flavored ketchups that were available on the tables which were Balsamic Vinegar and Jalapeno (refer to my pic).

All in all, what I had was very good. Its just the parking, location, and long wait that brought it down to a 3 star. I think a bigger place and more accessible location with a couple more registers would make it perfect.

I had brunch here on Sunday morning with a friend.  I arrived just after 10am, when they opened and it wasn't crowded (yet).  I was able to get a table for the 2 of us immediately and my friend arrived shortly after.  Lucky for us, because within 20 minutes or so, it was PACKED and there wasn't a seat to be found - even at the ""bar.""

This is an interesting concept.  As you likely already know - there are 2 sides of the menu - the ""Skinny"" or healthy side and the ""Fat"" or happy side.  I don't think the happy side has that bad of stuff on it, everything still seems somewhat healthy.

You order at the counter, which can cause a long line and back up.  When we tried to leave, it was hard to get out because there were so many people in line waiting to place an order.  Anyhow, there was also a guy taking beverage orders to keep those in line happy, which was very nice.

The cashier was friendly and helpful and offered recommendations.  My friend ordered a Juan Healthy Wrap from the healthy side (because she planned on ordering the Sunday Sundae as well) and I ordered the Drunken Gypsy Toast from the happy side. My food was creme bruleed french toast with berries, bananas, whipped cream and syrup served with apple smoked bacon ($7.75).  It was pretty darn delicious!  I also had a strawberry lemonade, which was only OK.  It tasted really watered down.

We then shared the Sunday Sundae, which was a Fruit Loops doughnut from Pink Box, on top of puff pastry with vanilla pudding and ice cream, fruit salad and whipped cream.  Boy was it sweet!  Way too sweet for me, but the few bites I had were tasty.

The reason I am on the fence - I really wanted to try one of their cold pressed juices, but I couldn't justify paying almost $10 for it.  That just seems crazy to me.  I can get a Bountiful Basket for $15 and that would make a heck of a lot more juice than the 24 ounce glass they serve for just less than that.  And people wonder why so many folks choose to eat at McDonald's on the Dollar Menu?!

I also dislike how tiny this place is.  It's uncomfortable to be eating with people lurking over your shoulder, waiting to take your seat.  It makes it hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you have to eat quickly.

Also, it's the strangest location.  Not hard to find, but not necessarily convenient to anything either.

Anyhow, brunch was overall pretty good.  I am not sure I would go out of my way to dine there, but it was a nice morning.",6,2,4

The menu is divided up by ""Healthy"" and ""Happy"", the former is which is ostensibly good for you while the latter is undeniably not. We shuffled around the board a bit with our orders. I got Mr. Flapjack (I think that's what it was called); basically two protein pancakes (they add in whey protein powder) with bananas and syrup, along with turkey bacon. My chick went with the popular cranburkey sandwich. And we also got an order of specialty fries, that turned out to be a mistake. 

The flapjacks were quite good, as far as flapjacks are concerned. It's not exactly the pinnacle of breakfast items. I am of the opinion that bananas make (nearly) everything better, so their inclusion here was enough to make me happy. I'm also a guy who tries to get a good amount of protein in with each meal, so having 18g (is that each? not sure) added into these pancakes satisfied my needs. Turkey bacon sucks. It always sucks. No matter how good someone tries to make it sound, it's never as good as real bacon. But if you want to eat something healthier, it's there. Personally, I would've liked some applewood smoked bacon thick as Jessica Simpson's thighs.

The fries. We ordered these special fries - which I can't seem to find on their online menu, and the name escapes me - but they were a mad doctor's concoction of sweet potato fries, balsamic vinegar, feta (might've been goat) cheese, and chicken. And I think some nuts might have been involved. It's one of those dishes someone thinks up while they're high, and you'd probably have to be in a similar mindset to eat them. Did. Not. Work.",1,1,1

I met 4 other people at noon on a Monday. It seemed pretty full at the time, but we had no issues waiting in line to order. Wait time for food to be served seemed just about right, and everyone in my party received their food roughly about the same time. 

I had the healthy breakfast option. Bonjour Br√ªl√©e: two pieces of French toast, two turkey sausage patties, berries, and agave. Although I was extremely jealous of everyone else's burgers, I was thoroughly happy with my meal choice. 

By the time my group was done, the restaurant was packed with a line almost to the door.

Thus begins my story of redemption in the form of many new and updated reviews, starting with one of my regular haunts of late:  SkinnyFATS.

Sticking with the biblical theme, as you all probably are aware by now SkinnyFATS gives you the option each visit to listen to either the devil or angel on your shoulder when deciding what to eat by choosing from either the ""Happy"" menu or the ""Healthy"" menu.   

So if you've ever met me, it will probably come as a surprise that I gravitated towards the Healthy side of the menu.   I've probably tried 75% of the items there.   Some favorites are the Cranburkey which places the increasingly popular thanksgiving meal concept in burger form.   I also like ""3 Healthy Chicks"" from their breakfast menu which is served all day.   It utilizes the same patties from the burger but places them in a breakfast plate format with egg whites and toast.   Every once in a while I've had some overcooked Cranburkey patties, but usually they're moist and delicious.

Other highlights from the healthy menu are the STEAKation (basically a healthy version of a cheesesteak hoagie), Right Stuffed (which was a pleasant surprise as I didn't expect a pepper stuffed with turkey to be so scrumptious), and the Wrap Supastar which is relatively speaking a healthy breakfast burrito option, and not the kind you get at Roberto's at 3 am.

If you end up listening to the Devil on your other shoulder, and come on, this is Vegas afterall, you can go for something on the Happy side.  Nothing says Happy like some fried animal goodness on a bun amirite?  If the Cranburkey is Abel, then Chix on Broadway is Cain, its sinister brother ready to bash its skull in with a slice of bacon.  Fried chicken, BLT, cheddar on brioche.  It's worth poor Burkey's demise.  I also really liked the Cherry Popper burger with its multiple spicy elements (banana peppers, pepperjack, a spicy slaw), but it being surrounded by Hawaiian rolls seals the deal.   Oh and they do a mean sweet potato fry here which goes well with any of the sandwich\/burger options.  Lastly I also really enjoyed the Bleu Balsamic which had shaved NY strip steak with tomato, red onion, and bleu cheese with a balsamic glaze.  I thought the combination of flavors all worked well in concert.

A couple disappointments for me were Tu-Nuts and Ahi Srirachi, as I didn't find the Tuna to be as melt in your mouth as I was hoping for, and Brussel Crowe tasted fine, but I didn't think there was enough on the plate to be worth the cost of admission.

Service is always attentive and friendly, and prices are reasonable!

One of my only issues with this location is simply how crowded it can get.  There's limited space and sometimes a very long line.   Adding to this, you'll often get overanxious patrons at the back of the line rushing to reserve themselves a table, leaving those who have already ordered without one.   I've noticed that when everyone just calmly orders and waits their turn, the general flow of those coming\/going tends to work out.   Heed that advice and your angel might forgive you for ordering the Chix on Broadway with Sweet Potato fries.",3,4,3

I loved the bread they used for the sandwiches, and they arranged the salad toppings into peace signs which was totally cute. I will say that the burgers were definitely rare, which I think is the best way to eat beef, but I think it bothered some people.

The juice was cold pressed and they were not sure how to explain that it wasnt really fresh squeezed, but still 9$.

The Off the Stick ($12) gluten-free pizza was large enough to share. It's not your typical pizza crust (thin and cracker-like), but everything topping it was so amazing that the crust was secondary. The Happymess ($9) with truffle fries and sliced filet is another hit.

Their menu is divided into healthy and not-so-healthy offerings. Although, some might argue that the agave nectar used in many of the healthy dishes isn't healthy at all. Personally, I'm not a fitness freak and I'm not strict about what I eat. I'll pretty much eat anything.

SkinnyFats is the Yin and Yang of the perpetually dieting community.  Their menu embodies the inner battle we all struggle with when deciding, ""What should I order?""  Should I get a burger or a salad?  Should I be good or bad? Should I be fat or skinny? 

Alas these are the questions only you can answer!  Well maybe not the last one, that might be up to genetics, and well the ""good or bad"" thing might be more of a moral issue.

Although we were en route to Bachi Burger, the line there was just too horrendous. Thank god for yelp, it lead us straight to skinnyfats.

SkinnyFats is the best of both worlds, you can get your super delicious, indulgence type of food that will bust your diet but make your tastebuds all so happy, or you can get a more waistline friendly selection that is equally delicious and satisfying. They have items ranging from the most delectable breakfast items to a more savory burger. 

Pros:
-good menu options and decent prices to mix and match your choices.
-good serving sizes.
-knowledgeable workers
-options to either go healthy or indulge in your inner fat kid

Cons:
-limited seating
-first come first serve bar space or tables
-not great for huge parties

I ended ordering a ahi srirachi taco and the slow boat to china. Although slow boat to china looked very small when it first arrived, to my surprise, the serving of chicken salad stuffed in the cucumber boat is actually quite substantial.

I really dug the whole idea and presence of this contemporary farm-inspired cafe, but I feel like its location does not serve it to its full potential as say maybe, downtown. This place is reminiscent of its up-and-coming counterparts located there, with its refreshing spin on food and novelty of a specific themed decor, but it felt like it was lost in a sea of industrial suite buildings by the freeway in the middle of nowhere. 

The employees were definitely friendly though, and provided us the low-down upon hearing that this was our first visit. We came at a slower time, so we didn't experience the line madness that I've read about. I chose an item from the ""healthy side"" - the Greek gluten-free pizza aptly christened ""Nice to Greek You,"" while my boyfriend ordered from the ""happy side"" - a BLT-esque sandwich entitled ""Bomb Diggity"" with a side of their truffle fries, which were sooo good. My pizza definitely tasted ""healthy,"" but because of its generous heaping of toppings, I was full after only half. I wasn't a big fan of the gluten-free bread, I guess, but that's a preferential thing. 

In addition, I liked how their cups are reusable. Take those babies home and wash 'em! All about being green. And if you're just going to have water, that's all right too, because they offer some lovely, fruit-infused water available at your dispense.

Overall: casual, modern atmosphere with friendly service and your choice to go ""healthy"" or ""happy (fatty)."" It's worth checking out! I'll be back for sure to check out their breakfast foods off the ""happy"" side.",0,0,0

On my first impression coming here, the setting is very unique ala Carson Kitchen (Downtown LV). This location is located in a small plaza area which is kinda hard to find. Their menu is divided into healthy items and ""happy"" items.  

The Berry Strong Waffle was ok tasting. The waffle was honestly a bit hard and the mint in the yogurt sauce was a little strong. The 2 cranturkey patties that came with it were not good. They were super dry. My wife liked her Chickhumm sandwich and she gave it a 9\/10. I got the classic burger which was good. When I had to remind the waiter that she forgot my shake, they upgraded me to a large size which was nice. Their shake was pretty thick; so thick that 4 or 5 sips will make you feeling quite full.

The Menu has two sections skinny and fat! 

We ordered cinnutella, steak and egg, and cookies.

Cinnutella - -Nutella french toast with some fruits, got this unique texture between a cake and cookie but then it gets soggy with the nutella sauce. I think it was a bit too sweet but still very tasty.

Steak and Egg - Steak was nicely cook medium rare but i guess i prefer poached or sunny side up egg, something that has running yolk in compare to their scramble egg which was a bit dry for me. 

Cookie - Got peanut butter and chocolate chunk cookies. Chocolate chunk cookie was on point! the chunk was so big and the cookie was not too hard not too soft, very buttery. Peanut butter cookie was very peanut buttery and good but it was a little too rich.

Sometimes you need a little bit of both especially if you're hung over on a Sunday. The place was packed but the service was friendly & quick. I ordered the Chicken Wrap Supastar and was happily surprised that something so healthy would taste so good. My boyfriend ordered the Cluck Moo and we both ate our plates clean.

First off, the location is a bit tricky as it is part of a large business complex. Luckily they have a huge billboard sign pointing down to where it is when I drove by it. The outside of the building itself is very unassuming as there are no signs and can easily be missed if you aren't looking. The place is fairly small and consists of maybe 8-10 tables with some counter seating as well. You order food at the counter, they give you a number, and find a spot to sit and they bring the food to you once ready.

Chix on Broadway with side of truffle fries - 4\/5 - BLT with a huge piece of fried chicken with a lemon aioli on a brioche bun - love this sandwich as it was full of flavor and the crunch from the bacon and especially the chicken was amazing. The truffle fries 
Ahi Taco San Taco - 4\/5 -  huge piece of fried Ahi with their special slaw, pico, and sauce - can be a bit messy but delicious!
Turnip Taco - 5\/5 - filet mignon with pico and their habanero lime cream sauce - has a pretty decent kick that lingers - my favorite taco out of the two I tried, definitely must-try
Salted Caramel Cookie - 5\/5 - amazing cookie! Loved this so much and wish I had bought more. It's not overly sweet and has the perfect chewiness with a slight crunch I think a cookie should have. Highly recommend their cookies!

They also make their own sodas using sugar cane which was really tasty. Not super carbonated and had their own unique flavor which I enjoyed very much. Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing! My go to drink every time I come here now. Overall, I enjoyed everything I tried here and didn't feel disgusting after eating so that's always a plus!",1,1,1

The location is kind of strange, but the food is amazing!  Small dining space.  I didn't know you could grab a table before ordering so we didn't, and by the time we ordered they were all full.  We had to sit at the high bar against the window, which was difficult with a 22 month old kid.

Of course, I ordered from the ""eat happy"" (aka FAT) side.  I think it was a special burger, the ""Cherry Popper.""  SOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!  Cherry and banana peppers, fried egg, cole slaw, and cheese on a burger on a Hawaiian bun.  I'm still thinking about it.  The fries were yummy too (sweet potato).

I ordered a smoothie for my daughter and I tasted it.  It was very yummy, but tasted more like a milk shake (it said strawberries, blueberries, and peanut butter, but it was white and I saw no hint of berry but did taste like a peanut butter milk shake).  Not sure it was as nutritious as I'd hoped, but delicious nonetheless.  Also, I got her some healthy tacos and tried a bite; they were great!

My dad and his wife fully enjoyed their meals as well!

I can't wait to take my husband here.  The ambiance is cute, definitely for the younger crowd.  I'm young myself, but, maybe it's because I'm a mommy, I get more sensitive to innuendos...""cherry popper"" sandwich, a banana on the men's restroom door, and a peach on the women's restroom door....there were other innuendos but I can't recall.  I'm just sensitive, as I don't think kids would really get them anyway, so I still think it's a fun place to take kids!

I tried it a year before I even moved to Las Vegas when I was out visiting here and I fell in love. They have a healthy and happy side which is perfect because you can eat here no matter what mood you're in. Since I moved out here I started going to an aerial studio right around the corner from here so most days I would come to skinny fats after my classes to eat. I used to come so frequently that one time one of the employees nominated me customer of the month (which is awesome that they show customer appreciation like that). Me and up to 15 friends got a free food party! It was awesome. To this day almost 2 years later they still recognize me and welcome me back every time I come in. It feels like home. 

I also love that they have a secret menu and every weekend they have a new Sunday and Benedict. If you follow their social media they post amazing food porn and you can see all of their specials and hidden items. I

So now onto my favorite dishes since I've almost tried them all. From the healthy side are usually go for the chickhumm, which is a grilled chicken breast sandwich with beet hummus. I also really enjoy the ahi tuna sandwich and the new vegan kale Caesar salad (not on the menu, you have to ask for it). 

From the happy side, my number one favorite dish in the entire restaurant is the big Parm. It is not on the permanent menu but it is on the computer that has a slideshow of hidden dishes on the secret menu. It's like a chicken Parmesan sandwich. I also love the buff chix, which is buffalo chicken tenders on top of truffle fries. There truffle fries are amazing I crave them all the time. 

Honestly you can't go wrong here so try something new every time and I promise you won't be disappointed!

Edit: I did forget to mention the one negative thing I have to say about this location specifically. They are always packed and they always have a very long line.

I ate here for the first time several months ago and was really impressed. A lot has changed in the time since my first visit. My wife and I decided that we needed a major lifestyle change, we needed to be more conscious about the foods we were eating, needed to eat out less, and just start living healthier. In a perfect world you make breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home, you never eat or drink bad, you are in peak physical condition, and you live to 110. That's a perfect world. Now reality. It's fun to eat out, cooking schmooking, exercising schmexercising, you know how it goes. I'm happy to say that we've changed a lot in our lives from an eating standpoint that's really helped.

So where does Skinnyfats fit into this? Well they fit perfectly because of the incredible healthy options they have. During some holiday shopping we needed to find a place to grab dinner and wanted to be health-concious about our decision. Skinnyfats was the perfect choice. I went with the Wrap Supastar and it was absolutely awesome. Fluffy egg whites, avocado, chicken, pico de gallo, and spinach in a delicious wheat wrap and topped with a lime\/cilantro yogurt dressing and some additional pico de gallo. It's honestly hard to believe that this was healthy. The portion since was huge. My wife went with the Vegwich. I'm not much of a mushroom man, but she said it was absolutely awesome. Unfortunately I didn't grab a picture of it, but that was also really big and was accompanied with a side.

**Confession** on my first trip here I had a chocolate banana milk shake. On this second trip I had a chocolate banana milk shake. It was a weak, but totally worth it moment. I don't know how they are able to perfectly incorporate the banana into the milk shake, but they absolutely do. No banana chunks, so smooth and amazing tasting. They have a wide array of shake options, definitely check it out if you' feel like ""living happy.""

It's probably my least favorite set up of ordering food that could exist. I don't know about the other locations, but you go up to the counter to order, and they give you a number. You then find a seat, and they bring your food out. This entire space is extremely small too. They can maybe fit 25 people in actual seats. It was not busy when we went, and we had to sit at bar seating which looks out the window to the airport. It was fun watching the planes while I ate, at least. It wouldn't keep me from coming back, but like I said it it's my least favorite way a food joint can be set up and I wish it were bigger. 

That all said, OMG THAT FOOD THOUGH. I liked everything I had except for the Ahi Taco.  Nothing about it was bad; it just didn't fit my particular palate. I didn't like how thick and strong the tortilla part tasted, I thought it covered up the flavor inside a bit. 

The Slow Boat to China and Blue Balsamic salad were superb, and Balls 2.0 were absolutely necessary!! I wish it were four smaller balls instead of two big ones, just for ease of eating, but it was so good. I got their diet soda, and I prefer Coke\/Pepsi to their own brand, but it wasn't bad. 

I know this review sounds mostly bad, but believe me, it isn't. It's just easy to pick out the little problems when a place is so popular. The food is worth it. If you haven't had SkinnyFATS, you have to go! Also, it is a pokestop.

They have a skinny, or healthy, side of the menu and they have a fats, or happy, side of the menu. It was like they wanted you to have a mental and psychological break down or something. You know the devil and the angel that appears on your shoulders? Well, the healthy side can be your angel while the happy side can be your devil. Now before I indulge a bit more ... let me start with my story.. 

I first read about this place when I was randomly browsing yelp and I had wanted to try it. However, the NEED to try it wasn't that great -- mainly because the menu wasn't all that interesting to me. Then came a yelp event where SkinnyFats participated.. well, needless to say that my friend and I were definitely and completely interested in them after we tried their food. So we made it our goal to try this place when we were both free. 

Alas! The time has come! I had two friends visiting from out of town last week and we took them to SkinnyFats for lunch. The place was smaller than we thought it would be. It didn't have a whole lot of tables, maybe about 8? But they did have a bar sitting area for the onesies...or for those who can't nab a table. We were lucky enough to nab a table for our party! Also on the side note, there are some seats that are directly in sunlight due to their lack of blinds so be prepared! 

Here is what we ordered\/what I've tried:

Chix on Broadway: Breaded chicken breast on brioche w\/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli. Amazing! At first when I read the menu, I was a little on edge with it being chicken breast but I gotta give them props. It was juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The sauce that it had paired so well with the chicken. I had to take the onions out though cause for some reason they were just really spicy. And then half way through, I took the bacon out cause it just ruined the texture. I would be eating this soft and juicy chicken burger only to bite down on some hard, crunchy bacon. It didn't fly with me. Oh and I pretty much finished the whole burger. It was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating even though I was stuffed up to my collar bone. As my co-worker once said, ""Finger licking good!"" 

Cheeseburger Benedict: 1\/2 lb. Angus burger w\/lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg & SF sauce. Honestly, I wasn't too into this. Maybe because when it comes to a beef burger -- a burger is a burger to me. There wasn't anything special about this and there wasn't anything that was particularly good about this. Once again, I had to take out the onions and I also noticed that you couldn't taste the avocado. Why? It wasn't ripe. In fact, it was kind of hard. 

Phatty Philly: Steak, saut√©ed onion, peppers, portobello, bleu cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie. When I tried a bite or two of this... first off, it had way too much bleu cheese for my liking. Perhaps you could say that I'm a little biased and I'm not a bleu cheese lover but it was really a LOT of bleu cheese! On top of that, even though it said it had sauteed onions, we couldn't really taste it. The steak, however, was very good -- tender and juicy. But overall, it seemed to be missing something.

Phatty Philly (Custom): My friend decided to switch out the peppers for some jalapeno and the bleu cheese for cheddar cheese. Well, when I tried this version... I liked the addition of the jalapeno into it but they didn't give it in slices, they gave it up kind of grinded. It may have been better in slices. I think that keeping the peppers would've been a better choice. It's too bad that they didn't have too many variety of cheeses to choose from. They only had bleu, cheddar, and american, I think? I would've preferred them to have the option of provolone or mozzarella at least as a substitution to the bleu cheese. 

Overall my preferred Philly version would have steak, sauteed onions, peppers, jalapenos, portobello, mozzarella\/provolone cheese, and of course the sauce. 

Ahi Taco-San Tempura: Ahi, sriracha slaw, mango pico & spicy aioli in a puffed shell. Okay, this was DELICIOUS. The puffed shell was amazingly good. The sauces, slaw, and mango went so well together. And the ahi was DELICIOUS. Nothing needs to be said about this besides TRY IT. 

Truffle Fries: Honestly, I didn't care too much about these. I may actually prefer just regular fries without the truffle oil. I'm a bit boring. I like my fries regular with some added salt and I'll be a happy camper. Cause if I don't eat the truffle fries right away, they just get soggy and I do NOT like my fries soggy. 

So, after all the things that we have tried, you can definitely tell what kind of people we are. We succumbed to our devil's desires ;)

Honestly, the Chix on Broadway and the Ahi Taco-san won it for me in the two trips I went. The food is honestly very good for the ones that I did like. I do plan to go back and try a few more things, such as their french toast!!

So give them a try!",4,0,1

Food: Chicken and waffles and the truffle fries are so good here. For drinks I also get one of those smoothies, the delightful cucumber. I love it so much and can't get myself to try the other smoothies. My boyfriend is usually more adventurous and tries the specials. It is a little on the pricier side. Probably $10+ per plate but definitely worth it. We have yet to be disappointed with the food here. 

Service: the girls here are so nice. The first time we went they walked us through the menu and explained everything.

You would have to use your phone to map this place out because it is on Dean Martin Drive in a business building plaza, not your typical location for a restaurant.

There are a lot of menu options, it is hard to pick just one to try for your first time. I ordered the Chix on Broadway, a breaded chicken sandwich with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and lemon aioli. Your side options include truffle fries, sweet potato fries, or healthier options of fruit, brown rice, and salad. I chose the truffle fries, and they are delicious. I could taste every ingredient in the sandwich, including the lemon aioli that was subtle yet added to the flavor. Chix on Broadway was made well and all the ingredients complemented each other.

For a somewhat fast food restaurant, the wait was 15 minutes for my food to cook. This is only because it's cooked to order from fresh ingredients, making it worth the wait.

I was genuinely pleased with my  first visit, I would come back to try something else new on the menu at this creative American restaurant.",2,0,0

FOOD
Whether you order from the ""skinny"" half of the menu or the ""happy"" half, the food is delicious and wholesome. 

Cranburkey: The name alone still gives me a chuckle when I think of it, but it's also one of the first items that caught my attention. Without reading the description, the title alone made me think this burger bares some similarities to a Bobby sandwich. Not the case. Sandwiched in between a 9 grain bun is a specially seasoned turkey patty, cranberry spread, arugula, and onion and tomato slices. First bite, the turkey patty's flavor reminded me of a breakfast sausage patty. Combine that with the cranberry spread, it's a perfect match. In addition, I really dug the presentation of my Cranburkey. I could get used to having my burgers presented to me with a knife jammed right in the middle, but I doubt burger joints would honor my request if I made it. 

My entree also came with the option of sides: truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a house salad. I skipped the fries this time and went with the house salad. The salad is simply chopped romaine lettuce with dices of cucumber and tomato, and it comes with ranch dressing on the side. The salad was just, well, a basic salad, but it obviously didn't come out of a bag and ""ready to eat,"" and that makes a difference in the dining experience.

RESTAURANT
Tiny. This spot seems to receive plenty of traffic even after the traditional noontime lunch hour, so seating is limited. However, you can place an order online and have your meal delivered to you. Going back to the seating aspect, if you sit at the high tables by the windows, there are electrical and USB outlets for your gadgets. Another plus side is that you get to watch the planes take off from the airport. 

SERVICE
Top-notch. Friendly and helpful, especially to first-timers.

Let me start by saying the it was perfect! In most chicken and waffles the chickens are chicken tenders and you can just tell. However, I have no idea what skinny fats did to their chicken tenders but it just hits the spot you want it to hit.

Their truffle fries we're okay. It was hard and crunchy so meh. It's still good. 

The other thing I got was the shake, I asked the cashier which one was his favorite and he said Nutella, banana and strawberry. I mean just those things together  is good but in a shake, can you say Mhmmm. After awhile the taste for me got old but my friend really liked it. Sooo all good",1,1,2

I had the fried egg on top of country fried steak & biscuits - seriously genius. I love biscuits and gravy, and I love country fried steak - it was like this dish was made for me.

This is a cafeteria-style shop where you order at the counter and then wait for your food, rather than having a waiter\/waitress take your order.

They have two menus here, a ""healthy"" menu and a ""happy"" menu. The design is pretty cute. I got the ""More Cow Bowl"" (a play on ""More Cowbell"") from the happy menu, which consisted of teriyaki filet mignon and veggies over egg fried rice. It was pretty tasty, and didn't feel as unhealthy as its presence on the ""happy"" menu implied.",2,0,0

Amanda M. is a fan so we knew we had to come.  Located on Dean Martin Dr., I must admit that getting here would be out of the way for most customers, but the place was still busy for a Friday at 1:30pm.  It's not a very big space, but there's a cool bar area with outlets for those who want to plug in and nosh, plus maybe 8 tables for others to sit.  The menu features a happy side and a healthy side, so customers have a choice of being bad or good, skinny or fat.  Suzy and I both had the acai bowls and her son had an order of Mr. Flapjack, protein pancakes with bananas and syrup atop the order--note that you could easily feed two people with that regular order.  The Skinny Bowl had acai, strawberries, granola, raisins, cranberries, bananas, and chopped almonds.  I know it's personal preference, but I found it to be okay in my book.  I like acai bowls with coconut, blueberries, and a touch of honey, items missing in this version.  I'm also not a fan of raisins in my food at all and the granola was more like granola cereal, packed not loose.  I ended up leaving all of the raisins and cranberries in the bowl, along with some of the granola.  Overall, though, I will definitely return to try some of the other items on the menu that look great.  Plus, I knew from perusing the Yelp pictures beforehand that they have a birthday freebie:  I got a Coke float with strawberries on the house and it definitely made my day.

Today, after a medical test, I found myself with a little time to kill before I had to head back to work, so I decided to stop in.

What a great concept.  A menu that is healthy, and happy!
As Nikki, my cashier, explained to me, the options on the happy side aren't necessarily ""unhealthy"", but there are slightly better versions of them on the ""healthy"" side of the menu. 

I love it.
There were tons of items to choose from, and I can tell you for sure, I will be back, and SOON to try as much as I can!

Today, in an effort to stay on my healthy living plan, I had the ""Smoke in a bowl"", which was Agave BBQ chicken, with peppers, pineapple,  and onions over brown rice, with black bean salsa,  and cilantro lime yogurt.  

Ok fine, I had the truffle fries too. 

The chicken bowl was a decent sized serving...a bit more than I could eat, but not an enormous (ridiculous) portion, either.  It was full of flavor.  I really enjoyed the pineapple bits!  

The truffle fries, I took to go, and ate when I got to work...well...most of them.  I was pretty full, but they were good.  Not too heavy on the truffle oil, and they were cooked well.

I REALLY enjoyed my visit.  
Lets talk about service, too, shall I?
Nikki was phenomenal.  
I told her it was my first visit, and she explained the menu to me, in detail, and even chatted with me a bit after I had ordered.  

It looks like this place gets pretty busy, and its not a big location, so you'll want to try to avoid standard ""lunch times.""  I got there about 11, and it was empty till about 11:15.

Walking in, we were all shocked to find that inside was filled with people for such a small location. I thought ""Wow! This place must be good!"" ... and boy was I right. The menu is split up into 2 sections, one for healthy alternatives and the other for well yaknow, the good stuff. 

On Sundays, they alternate different brunch specials. I decided to try their special that day. It was a Mushroom Benedict made with spinach, eggs, and shrimp. So flavorful! The hollandaise sauce which it was topped off with made each ingredient and bite combine perfectly. I also ordered a side of their breakfast potatoes.

A Skinny, healthy side and an indulgent, fat side.  You'll find a large, unique menu that ranges will cover just about any dietary need or want.  Fresh, healthy salads share the spotlight will fantastic burgers and fries.  It's one of the best concepts I've ever experienced. 

My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - The only negative to SkinnyFATS is that it's not a big restaurant.  But it's one built for the 21st century.  Inside you'll find wooden walls decorated with custom art.  There's also a long counter with bar stool seating with electric outlets with USB ports.  On a Thursday evening visit the light was dim, the music chill, and I felt like I was at a hip lounge.  1 Star.

Service - Upon entering you'll line up next to the main bar\/counter and wait to place your order.  The staff will set you up with a nice, cold drink with a nice selection or beers while you're waiting to place your order.  Once you do, you'll get a number, find a seat, then wait for them to bring it out.  One side note, our party of 7 called in to let them know we were coming & they setup a group of tables for us before we got there.  1 Star. 

Food - Ever been to a restaurant where you don't know what to order because everything sounds so great?   Well SkinnyFATS fits the bill.  But I'll be honest, I didn't bother with the skinny\/healthy side, instead I focused on the burgers.  Just about everyone in our party ordered one.  I went with the patty melt.  It was delicious with a buttered, griddled sourdough sandwich with perfectly melted cheese and juicy patty.  The parmesan truffle fries were a great side to pair with it.  The meal was fantastic and I think I went through a huge stack of napkins on my way to devouring it all.  They even serve breakfast dishes all day.  I didn't quite get to that part of the menu, but it's good to know for the future.  2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  Honestly I feel like I need to come back in another big party and just agree to share all our dishes.  Breakfast, burgers, healthy, happy, SkinnyFATS has a great menu and I'm sold.  Without a doubt my next visit to Vegas will include a trip back.  1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",28,19,22

It is a nice unique touch to the ""usual"" fast food restaurants. One side of the menu features healthy food entrees while the other half features not as healthy entrees. The food overall is pretty good. Its a nice place to go for 2 with anyone who is on a diet or is a health conscious individual and a food junkie in one restaurant. 

The girl taking the order at the register was really nice. She was the definition of delightful. I felt like ordering more just based off of her delightfulness. 

It is a fairly costly place as a downside but quality is something you always have to pay a bit more for right? One thing I didn't like was that the signing receipt was asking for a tip after I swiped my credit card...if this was a service place where the servers come to the table and ask me for my order, fill drinks, etc...then I would understand a tip area. 
Makes me wonder..does the owner not pay the employees enough that they ask the customer to pay for the food(customer covering cost plus profit) and the employee(covering owners cost) making the food as well??

I was lucky to be able to have lunch with fellow yelpers Jessie and Allison one weekday afternoon. This location is teeny tiny, but luckily Allison was a sweetheart and got there early to reserve us a table. So glad she did because this place has about 10 tables total, and they were all full. There was a line almost out the door, too. 

I had browsed the menu before hand, so I knew I wanted the Vegwich, which is described as portobello, avocado, cherry\/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt on 9 grain toast w\/side. I opted for sweet potato fries as my side and got the yogurt on the side as well. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to go, as part of Yelp Shares the Love promotion that is going on. 

The sandwich was so good and so were the sweet potato fries. I didn't care for the horseradish yogurt and am glad I got it on the side. The sandwich was so flavorful it didn't even need a sauce. My dining partners both got the Slow Boat to China, which looked amazing, and one of them got the hummus plate which looked good as well. I will have to try both those items next time.

I just wish this place was larger. I am sure they have heard this a million times by now, and hopefully they will expand not just to another location, but something A LOT bigger. And yes, I am aware of the location on Warm Springs and while it is bigger, it is still pretty small. If Allison hadn't been there to get us a table, we wouldn't have had anywhere to sit and eat. I shouldn't have to worry about wether or not I will have somewhere to sit to eat my lunch. Regardless of that, I will come back, especially since it is only 8 minutes from my work. :)

The red velvet waffles have real buttercream frosting yay. Ordered two breakfast to carb load and walk the strip today. Better if you don't want Vegas buffets and chains. They have another location near sunset park too a lovely park with ponds and desert plants. Thank you. -Luke,1,0,1

The Maine wedge was missing dressing and was packaged in the smallest container that it didnt have the same flavor because not everything was distributed evenly. The dressing was the most disappointing though because without it it didnt taste at all as wonderful as it normally is. I also order the phatty philly almost every time and was so upset that I couldn't eat it. They have changed it and didn't mention it and it doesn't say it on the menu either.

Want to keep it healthy? There is something for that. Do you eat gluten free stuff or are you vegan? Well, you're in luck! The young lady, Jocelyn working the register told me there is something for everyone here. She was very nice and was able to give some insight on the items. 

Since it was my first time I had to go with the Cherry Popper (you never will forget your first time, unless it wasn't done right, and I'm sure if it wasn't cooked to your liking they will make you another). Burger topped with an egg and some coleslaw, plus a little spice to give it a kick. I love the taste of a fried egg on top of burgers. Since I'm not real fan of French fries, I decided to go with the cauliflower rice. I was trying to balance out my meal and make part of it vegan. The rice was so delicious. They mix it with some garlic. You will need to try it. 

I was able to sneak a bite of the bacon and sausage from my bro's plate. He swore it was the best bacon he ever had. I thought it was good. I could not leave without trying some of their cookies. The cookies are on display next to the register. My will power was non-existent that morning. The salted caramel and snicker-doodle was recommended. I decided to go with it. The cookies are a bit pricey at $3\/each but they were well worth it. 

The restaurant is easy to find since they have a huge billboard alongside the road. You can't miss it, right off Dean Martin Dr., located in an industrial park. The place is small inside. Think of a small starbux with lots of tables. Not ideal for large groups. I did notice one group of six and they were comfortable. Most of the tables sit 4 and a few sit 2. There is also a long counter near the entrance to sit and enjoy your food if you're riding solo. Water is available next to the cookies. 

I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas, so I can eat here again. Give them a try. Happy eating!",23,15,23

We had a quick lunch here when in Vegas this summer and ordered The Classic (medium rare and juicy), a side of truffle fries (comes with The Classic), and the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (fried chicken breast strips over buttermilk waffles and syrup). 

Truffle Fries: The fries are regular shoe-string style and fresh, with lightly sprinkled truffle and cheese. It was slightly under seasoned, but the truffle scent and taste really shined. Delicious by its own merit or with a quick visit to the ketchup pond.

The Classic burger: The fresh bun is dwarfed by the amount of veggies, thick tomato slices, and enormous juicy patty; if you're a messy eater, grab a few napkins before you start. It was a perfect combination of healthy veggies and the gluttony of burger meat...

Chick-a-waff-a-dopolis: A few reviews mentioned that this was a ""secret"" menu item, but I saw it on the menu like anything else. Thick cuts of delicious chicken breast dipped and fried in an amazing batter. The chicken was well seasoned and had a kick of flavor. The waffles and syrup was great, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall, SkinnyFATS is a great escape from the binge eating habits most tourists experience on the Strip. It doesn't aim to be more than it is -- the perfect place for lunch.

I came with a big group so I apologize to everyone who didn't get to sit because of us.

It's like a not entirely too healthy health cafe.  You basically order at the counter and they give you a number to know where they bring your food.

They have a Healthy side AKA the Skinny and then a Happy side AKA Fats.

Everything is reasonably priced. Considering this is sort of close to the strip, it's geared towards health, and it has unique\/quality dishes the prices are awesome. 

They have a bunch of salads that are under $7 (without meat) and are big for the price.

Usually places like this try to sell you overpriced salads.

Also it's good for kids! We brought three kids who liked it. They have a kids menu which I believe is $5 a meal. The sweet potato fries and chicken strips is a generous size that most adults would be overly satisfied with.

I had a Cobb salad from the Happy side and an Asian Cucumber boat off of the healthy side with a smart water. The salad was fresh! The cucumber boat had chicken salad in it topped with teriyaki and spicy mayo sauce. Each food item was about $7 and they were both delicious. Getting two things kind of defeated the purpose of eating healthy but i had to since it was my first visit. 

The food is good, the staff is nice, it's clean, it's priced well, and it helps put a spin on healthy food while still appealing to foodies without diet restrictions.

I got the mean bean burger which is a vegetarian burger, which is surprising because I usually don't go vegetarian for my burgers. I also got their frickles (friend pickles).

The burger was okay as far as vegetarian burgers go. I can't really judge the quality since I dont really eat vegetarian burgers, but I enjoyed it. Frickles were really good - recommend! And fries were good too.

Portion-wise the burger was bigggg, fries were a plenty, and there were a good number of frickles. Ended up boxing up ~1\/2 the burger and some fries\/frickles. 

The place is really cramped inside, especially when it gets busy (like during lunch when my coworker and I were there). There were people standing around waiting for others to finish and leave.

It's a small quick service restaurant located on Dean Martin where you wouldn't exactly expect to find a restaurant. Inside there's a few tables and bar top seating against the the walls. You order and pay at the counter and the workers bring the food out to you as soon as it's ready.

The menu has a unique concept that matches the name perfectly; ""skinny"" (healthier) items and ""happy"" (delicious, fatty, the last thing you should consider eating on a diet) items. The menu is also very diverse, including a variety of breakfast items and lunch entrees ranging from seared ahi tacos, turkey stuffed peppers, tofu fried rice, to a classic cheeseburger. 

I asked the young lady working the counter what she recommended on the skinny side and she said her favorite was Smoke in a Bowl, a dish with BBQ chicken. She asked if I liked spicy food (which of course I said yes to) and she strongly recommended the CauliFIRE, which is cauliflower tossed in hot buffalo sauce and topped with garlic and pico de gallo. I went with the second recommendation and added grilled chicken for some protein. I also had to try one of their juices so I got the Liquid Defense (orange, lemon, lime, apple, carrot juice) which I was a big fan of. My friend went with his go-to chicken and waffles.

The food came out within 10-15 minutes and I enjoyed my dish! It was very simple yet satisfying. Cooked cauliflower and strips of grilled chicken tossed in their spicy buffalo sauce. Came with celery, carrots, and fat free ranch too. It was definitely good, but not anything that blew away my taste buds. I did order from the skinny side so I have to take that into consideration...

I ordered the buffchix for me and the wifey to have as a sampler and she ordered the protein waffle with seared chocken and it was amazing. They serve it as a healthy dish which makes you feel less guilty about your craving for chicken and waffles. The buffchix is good but i saw someone next to me order the same thing but naked, id get the naked next time although the breading on the tenders were not overpowering. The cherry popper was good, had a tiny spice to it and was really sweet. If you are into that type of thing this is for you but it was a little to wet for my liking and the bread broke apart a little at the end. But the custom made juices and shakes put it over the top. I will definitely reccomend this to anyone. On a side note its a lil ways from the strip. Call for a cab about 5-10 mins before you finish",0,0,0

I got the dabayou (sp?) double patty burger with Cajun sweet potato fries. Those were the best sweet potato fries that I have ever had! The burger was pretty tasty itself, not as big as I thought it would be but it was good enough for me and I shared it with someone. I also got the jazz hands float (vanilla frozen yogurt or you could choose to put vanilla ice cream, sprite, and chopped pieces of mango). Then me and 2 friends shared rediculous off the breakfast menu (more of a dessert....) which is a red velvet waffle with a lighter version of the cream cheese frosting, blackberries and raspberries, chocolate drizzle, bacon, and syrup on the side. The prize ranged but averaged I would say 10-15. Their smoothies were pretty expensive, about $10. Parking was decent. It's a small place, could probably fit like 30 people. 

Also, they offer free hugs so I took up that offer and the cashier was nice and she gave me a hug and everyone else at my table decided to get a hug. The art on the inside of the restaurant is pretty cool as well. Service is awesome, people asked if it was out first time and it was since we were visiting from San Diego so one of the guys explained the menu to us (so many options!).

I have tried EVERYTHING on their menu. 
So far, my favorite on the Happy side is their Filet O Fire. And the healthy side has to be their Naked Chix bowl. I'm also OBSESSED with the CauliFire shareable! 

A couple substitutions if you really want to feast on grease; I would order the secret menu fries ""Happymess"" but I would order it without the NY shaved steak as it can be a little chewy if not eaten right away. 

The Big Parm on the secret menu is only 11.95 and totally worth it. 

And their Frickles (AKA fried pickles) are 4.20 and for that price they taste like a million bucks. 

I like to sub my Naked Chix with Cauliflower rice instead of jasmine or brown rice. Always good to add in those extra veggies whenever you can! The rice doesn't change the taste at all, it's still delicious!!!

Healthy or fat? Pick your poison. Warning, both are delicious and generous portions. 

Scrambled burrito with egg whites, chicken, spinach, avocado and pico. Yum! It was a huge size. I could barely finish it. As I took each bite my taste buds never felt as if they were getting cheated. 

We decided to try the skinny ahi tuna taco and the shrimp taco. The tuna one was gross. The soft shell was just that, soft. Actually I would say it was soggy. Everything just melted together. There was no crunch. The shrimp taco was way better tasting. However like the previous taco. this one was a fat choice. It was a bummer we had to eat it with a fork as it fell apart and was unable to be eaten. Boo. Tacos are  to be eaten with hands!

My fianc√©'s entree choice was another fat option. The fried jalape√±o steak sandwich with French fries. My soon to be hubby is infatuated with spicy but boy did this bring tears to his eyes. Usually his asks for extra hot, add salsa and to kick it up a notch. Not this time ladies and gentlemen! He was peeling it open and trying to take out the jalape√±os. Guess there's a first time for everything.

I got the Phatty Philly with truffle fries and my mom ordered the Ahi tacos so we split. Both were fantastic! Saturday we decided to go back for the second time. The experience was extremely disappointing. My husband and I ordered the Phatty Philly and Ahi Tacos to split. The guy informed us that the deeper Fryer was broken so no truffle fries and no Ahi Taco. However he did suggest the sirachi tacos so we agreed to give it a shot because he said he liked it. We agreed to a side salad instead of the fries (obviously disappointed).  When our order came the Phatty philly was good but it had no blue cheese or mushrooms inside which are two main ingredients. The side salad had chopped cucumbers in it which my husband was very specific in ordering no cucumbers  in the salad. They remade us a salad no problem and the house dressing was very tasty but the tomatoes were soggy. Now when I bit into the Sirachi taco I was expecting the same goodness as the Ahi Tacos but was caught off guard with how disgusting it was. I literally wanted to spit it right out my mouth. It was as if they hadn't seared the fish at all. It was a cold fish taco. Yuk!! Even though we had a bad experience I will give this place one more shot because the first time the food was so good.

You ever eat something and the entire time you're thinking ""OhMyGodOhMyGodOhMyGod?"" That's what happened to me tonight. I had the TBLT with avocado and truffle fries. First, the sandwich. A subtle aioli spread beautifully complemented the fresh, multi-grain bread. The turkey bacon was cooked to perfection. The whole thing melted into my mouth, a cacophony of fresh, aromatic flavors. The french fries, good Lord, the fries. Best.Fries.Ever. Their scent alone made me swoon. Over and over, I'd hold the fry below my nose a few seconds, just to inhale it. Its scent was strong, nutty yet earthy. The consistency, light, a bit chewy with just enough crunch. I ate this meal like I've not known food before. Maybe I haven't. And I'm speaking as someone who at one time was well off enough to dine often in 5 star joints (things change, recession, blah blah).

The concept of a half healthy and half fun menu doesn't sound like it would work. What I tried didn't work at all. Everyone I dealt with was very friendly and helpful so no service complaints. They couldn't have been nicer. The room is small and cramped. It's a place where you order at the counter, you get a number and they bring the food to your table. As I was waiting in line to order, a waitress was having an argument with a cook thru the kitchen window. She said the order was supposed to be without peppers(?) and the cook was saying that it didn't have peppers. She said she could see the peppers and asked him to make her a new plate. My instincts said to leave. Instead, I ordered a classic burger med rare, a chicken quinoa soup and a coke. I should have left. All tables were full so I took one of the stools along the side bar at the window. The barstools are tiny little things on cylinders that bob up and down as you sit. They are uncomfortable and annoying. The place was busy and I kept getting bumped by people coming and going. That alone ruins the place for me. The soup was brought quickly and looked great in a big cup with herbs on top. The soup was luke warm and bland. It was void of any seasoning. It had lots of veggies and chicken but no flavor and was not served hot enough. The burger shows up in good time and looks nice but picking it up showed immediate problems. The lower bun was already wet from juice. Fingers poked though and it flattened as I tried to eat it. First bite and the meat and veggies slid away, tomatoes fell out. Meat was too rare and under seasoned. Second bite and the bun is totally soaked and dime thin and burger falling apart. I took the plate to the counter and showed the girl the wet broken bun. She offered to make a new one. I was over it, said it was just pathetic and walked out. The food is bad. Either the kitchen doesn't care or cant cook. Seating is miserable.

The first two times we ordered To-go from their website and it asked us to set a time we would like to pick it up. We got there on time and each time waited over 30 minutes passed our pickup time for our food. Whenever you ask the staff what's going on they say it will be right out. We ordered breakfast I didn't understand how that could take more than an hour. After about 20 minutes we saw the server that was working the cash register when I paid for my food was now done with her shift and walking to her car with 3 huge bags of food. So the staff stopped paying customers orders to cook for another staff member. So unprofessional. I was informed by the manager they would refund our money for the inconvenience after we waited another 10-15 mins for our food. So we decided to come a second time and used the website to order again and I'm not even kidding the exact same thing happened again, except this time we waited 45 minutes. So some time had passed (about 6 months or so) so we ordered again last night and went to pick up the food and my cinnaps shake tasted like vanilla ice cream so I asked if they could remake it considering it cost over $7 and the girl rolled her eyes at me and got on the radio and said ""This customer wants her shake remade"", then I see the cooks in the kitchen look out the order window with an annoyed look and she replied to them ""sorry guys"" like I'm crazy for wanting my shake made right! I got the shake and went to my car when I tasted it there was so much ginger it burned my throat. I was annoyed so I just went home. It was like they were being petty because I asked for a new one. The final straw was when I got home and my burger was well done and beyond dry when I asked for it to be cooked to medium. I will never spend another penny with this restaurant.

also had Truffle fries
I wasn't down to pay $7 for a smoothie this day but maybe another day I will. 
My sandwich was pretty good, a little dry, but I like my sammich with a little extra spread than what most people like. I guess if you want Healthy though you have to watch your serving size. As for my truffle fries, they were decent. My favorite still comes from BurGR.

First the location is a bit...out of the way. They mentioned a 2nd location opening soon at Decatur & Warm Springs. Parking was OK. We went around 1230pm on a Sunday and it was jam packed. Seating is super limited...people will hover to get your table when your are nearing completion of your meal.

It was very clean. Even though the tables turn over at lightning speed, the staff was on top of wiping them down. I, also, noticed things like a customer a few tables over dropped his silverware & without skipping a beat, a staff member brought a replacement. Also, a different staff member saw a straw wrapper on the floor and picked it up on her way to do something else. My husband works in the restaurant industry, so I've been trained to notice these things.

Service was super friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter, TRY to find a seat, and they give you a number to put on your table for someone to deliver to you. They know they menu really well so they can answer questions, offer suggestions, or make substitutions.  Also, even though we didn't notice our food took a while...the guy who brought the food or to us, apologized & gave up a free cookie!!

I had the Bleu Balsamic which for some reason I thought was a sandwich, but s actually a salad. It was AMAZING. It includes shaved beef, which many places fail at and it can be tough and rubbery. Not here!! It literally melts in your mouth!! My husband had a Sweet Cheese Us without the portobello & truffle oil. With 2 drinks, it came to about $20. The cookies are big and baked to perfection. The chocolate was high quality too...the chocolate chips just tasted chocolate-ier than what you expect. In fact, everything we had was really fresh & you could tell.

I would absolutely go back here, there are so many menu items I want to try, especially the Sunday Sundae. I cannot wait for the next location to open!!",0,0,0

We tried the Steak Eyes which is like biscuits and gravy but better with steak. The meat was so tender we could cut it with a fork. 

We also had the Cinnutella which was cinnamon sugar French toast with spiced Nutella, berries and orange agave. It was was like dessert for breakfast. 

Will definitely return next time we are in Vegas.",0,0,0

I have to say that the exterior and interior of this place is truly unique. There is art painted all over the walls and there's mirrors surrounded by a tin like design when you look up. The only thing I have to say that sucks is that the restaurant only seats around 30 people with not a lot of space between tables. 

Skinnyfats has a healthy side and a ""happy"" side on their menu. They also have a wide variety of beverages. Everything is pretty pricey for the amount you get when it comes to snacks. 

I found out that this place had a secret menu. I looked it up and decided to get the Steak and eggs. For a total of $14 this meal comes with slices of steak, potatoes, eggs, and toast. I am so glad I got this dish because the portion was huge and everything was delicious. The steak was so juicy and tender and there was plenty of it. The potatoes were also a hit. The only thing bad about this meal was the desert-dry toast. 

My friends all got something different and they paid too much to receive so little and or a mediocre plate. The Acai bowl didn't have much Acai but a ton of granola. My friend got a sandwich and rice and it was all sorts of bad. The truffle fries on the contrary were cheap and tasted great. You get a big bowl of them!

Their healthy menu contains a variety of salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, and sides with healthier ingredients, while their happy menu contains the same repertoire with ingredients not as beach body oriented, let's say.

I went to SkinnyFats and was offered a ""secret menu"" item, as several appeared on a little monitor set on top of their cash wrap. What I ordered was some sort of turkey club-sequel sandwich, but way better. It had whole grain bread, fresh tomatoes and baby arugula, creamy goat cheese, crispy bacon, and the juiciest chicken with a side of fries, yes -- the not as beach body oriented ones.

The orchestra of flavors from the sandwich was great. The tingly creamy sourness of the goat cheese acting as an enzyme for the gamut of flavor notes that the sandwich had. The fresh tomatoes and arugula gave the sandwich a crunch and freshness that held you by the hand and walked you over to the juiciness of the grilled chicken -- and just when you thought you had hit the cusp of the flavourful ride -- there was that crunch from the bacon that just cannot be underestimated in a sandwich. The saltiness but firm flavor made it a grand experience, it just culminated in a subtle mix of sour freshness that was neutralized by the bacon and then layer with the tasty, toasted but slightly soggy from the veggies, whole grain bread.
My girlfriend ordered a tuna salad, with greens, berries, nuts, and dressing,  which I was unable to get to but I assume they were as fresh as my vegetables, and seared tuna. The tuna had a crunchy bordering which was citrusy and a bit crunchy. The texture was, as most raw tuna, slimy but the flavor had a slight hint of the spices used to sear it and its own fishy flavor. It was a delicious flavor profile but I bet it must have been better with the other greens and components of the salad.

Needless to say, I am definitely going back to SkinnyFats in the near future.",0,0,0

It's located in a commercial area, so don't be fooled by the lonely buildings and empty lots. There's a trendy and yuppie vibe inside the restaurant with a cool menu that has a Healthy Side and Happy Side (aka notsohealthy). They do have a few specials featured on the flat screen that are not on the menu.

I ordered the Slow Boat to China with a side of truffle fries. Orders came out fairly quick. My Slow Boat was similar to a sushi roll without the rice. It wasn't overly spicy, which I appreciated. Wish it were less salty. Truffle fries are truffle fries-- always yummy, can't go wrong with them.

Great comfort food for a fair price. Definitely worth trying this place at least once if you haven't been here.

Compared to the first time, the line was sane and the scene was chill - not like the mob scene we encountered last time. It worked well in our favor, along with the fact that we researched and decided on what we wanted among their extensive menu beforehand - last time we felt a lot of pressure due to the long line behind us and each menu item having lots of different ingredients to understand. So do your homework first!

We managed to get a table and polite and fast service! Among the smoothie juices, we tried the hangover remedy, garden treat, and delightful cucumber. They were all good. If you expect Jamba juice amount of sweetness, no - it's a more adult version with beets and cucumbers that are not so sweet. For our entrees, the More Cowbell, Meltdown, Smoke in a bowl, and Hot Chix. Hot Chix was spicy! with the fried jalapenos...I really liked it, and a good value for $10. Smoke in a bowl was a bit weird for us and it actually tasted better as next day's leftovers. More Cowbell was a favorite with high quality beef and lots of veggies. The Meltdown was just that - a big honkin' patty melt that made for 2 meals. A little on the greasy side, but that's the point. Our toddler fell asleep on the way so she missed her meal until later that night. The children's meals were good value and for the chicken, offered grilled. Compare their 4.95 chicken meal to Chik-Fil-A and it was a good deal.

Even though you expect a bunch of muscle heads to be there because it's a health conscious restaurant, it's a super hip place.
Customer Service:
Great staff, you can tell when someone loves what they do or are really good at paying attention to detail. I love that you place your order at the register and they bring it to your table and pick up your dish after your done.
Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian.

SkinnyFats has some of the best food I have ever had here in Las Vegas. I could say that this eatery is on my top list at number one. A choice of eating healthy or happy is a cool concept. A great marketing strategy to attract people who sometimes workout and people who pig out. Guilty pleasure. I loved the turkey burger on the health side which was served with a special yogurt sauce. Nom nation. The truffle fries here are amazing too. Until next review. I need to try more of their dishes on both sides of the menu.,2,1,1

I pass by this place on the daily from the I-15, Terry, never managed to realize this place.  The sign wording is cool old school American farm style design, but too cluttered to make out from afar.

Once we finally arrived, I wasn't kidding when I added the tip about the clown car seating.  It is FCFS seating, so you can imagine, it can get pretty cut-throat, especially if you are really hungry.  I hoarded a cluster of tables and chairs from different ends of the dining area like a stingy toddler on the Amazing Race...mine mine MINE!!! (Hissing noise)

Truth be told, I was happy to learn that my supposed healthy\/unhealthy meal was more on the unhealthy side, am I wrong for that?  We ordered the truffle fries, pollo fries, chef's special streak Benedict (2x) and drunken gypsy toast.

The wait was a bit lengthy and hadn't it been for the great Kentucky and Wichita State game during the madness, I may have had a more to say.  The inside is very well kept but the thermostat needed to simmer down a notch.  Don't very new wrong, I like it breezy, but I like my food sizzling even more...cold food robs meals of their flavor profiles.  

Overall, the meal was good, the steak wasn't over cooked and the cornbread on the Benny was a good compliment.  The limited edition Heinz ketchup in jalapeno and vinegar flavor was a nice added touch as well.  Not bad and reasonably priced.  Just not sue if I would come unless it's xmas eve to avoid the crowd...3. 75 stars.",5,3,1

The restaurant is appropriately named to describe the menu exactly. On one side, you have a healthy (skinny) variety of choices, and on the other, you have a plethora of happy (fats) dishes.  Both sides have some seemingly delicious choices, but for me, happy always wins if I'm eating out since I always eat healthy at home.  

The restaurant itself is tiny, with about 8-10 tables total that seat 2-4 people.  Don't expect to be able to have too private of a conversation with your dining companions as you will be as close to the table next to you as you are to each other. In addition to the tables, there is a bar that is lined up against the wall as you walk in with maybe 8 additional seats.  You first order at the counter and pay for your food, then they give you a number that you can set on your table, if you're lucky enough to get one, so they know where to bring your food out. I've heard this place is chaos at lunch, but since it was about 7:30pm we were able to get a table as soon as we walked in. 

Onto the food!

Chix on Broadway w\/a side of sweet potato fries ($9.50): This massive chicken sandwich is not your ordinary plain dried chicken breast on a bun. Ooooh no.  This is much much more.  The chicken breast is lightly breaded and deep fried and so massive that its ends stick out of the delicious soft brioche bun by at least an inch or two on each side.  It's topped with w\/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli.  This sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The chicken is tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  This was by far my favorite of all the stuff we ordered. The sweet potato fries are thin cut and perfectly cooked.  They weren't out of this world, but still yummy.  5\/5

Cheeseburger Benedict w\/a side of truffle fries ($10.50): Everything about this burger was great, but it wasn't mind-blowing like the Chix on Broadway. It tasted like a good burger.  The egg yoke created a bit of a mess but my bf liked wiping it up with the bun. The truffle fries were good, but they just tasted like regular fries with a bit of garlic on them.  4\/5

Smoke in a Bowl ($9.50): My friend ordered this from the healthy side. The flavors  of everything in it would make it seem like it should be bursting with more flavor, but it was just ok. It had big chunks of bbq chicken mixed in with pineapple, brown rice, peppers, onions, salsa, and cilantro lime yogurt. 3\/5

The staff was really friendly and personable.  Our food came out fairly quickly and they were also quick to clean our plates off once we were done eating.  I'm really excited to go back. Hopefully I'll be able to resist ordering the Chix on Broadway again so I can try other things on the menu!",3,1,1

1. The success of the business has led to occupancy problems. The place is packed. All the time. Space restrictions force you to plan out your visit there. You'll have to know what you want and bring a friend to scout for a place to sit while you wait in line to order.

2. The staff does not seem to communicate to each other very well and there seems to be little direction. During peak times I cannot figure out what each counter staffs function is other than to do whatever it is they feel like at that particular moment.  The only constant position I can observe is the person who sits at the register and take orders while everyone else chases their own tails. I cannot comment on the kitchen direction though as there is not enough open view behind the overcrowded eating area.

3. Don't bother trying to order over the phone. When they are red lining beyond the usual total chaos they will let the caller go to voicemail. If you do get through, plan on bring pissed off when you go to pick up your order. There is no separate pickup counter or window.  You'll have to sit in the line and wait to pay. I have on 3 separate occasions paid for the pickup and waited over 20 min for someone to bring the order up without apology. This is a direct communication error between front counter and kitchen staff. Particularly because there does not appear to be anyone responsible for ensuring over the phone pickup orders are tended to.

Overall all these problems fall squarely on managements shoulders. Please remedy.",1,0,0

Let me put it this way, the single star is obligatory, with the review. 

This place, and I understand they have another location, is small; that has no real bearing on the review, it just played into the bad experience (it'll make sense by the time I'm done). We ordered our food and I got the Bleu Balsamic, also ordering the sweet potato fries. My wife ordered the Sweet Cheese Us and truffle fries. Simple enough order, if only it had been a simple, enjoyable meal. Again, this place is small and there were a total of four of us in our party, since it was crowded we chose to sit at the table outside; they assured us they would bring our order to us. 

A mere forty (yes 4-0 minutes) later our food was finally on its way, which we only found out, because we intercepted the server looking for us. We had to wait another 5 minutes for our friends food, which we soon learned had been ready, but set aside, and promptly forgotten. What's worse, we had to ask for the food, and were told it was coming out; this wasn't the case, so when we asked again, we were told we needed to present the receipt (that would be the receipt they never provided).  We pointed this out to the server and they did look and then locate our missing items. They commented when they handed it to us that it had been ready for us for a half hour but they didn't have a name; probably has something to do with not asking for a name when they took the order (small detail (you may be picking up on the sarcasm by now, sorry I'm compensating for my still growling stomach)).

As you can imagine the now thirty minute old Sweet Cheese Us (their version of a cheese steak) was served up on the most incredibly soggy bread. Hey, if you're into soggy bread that's great; not my thing and my wife bravely endured, but it wasn't good (yes, I tasted it and it was not good). In all fairness it may have been an okay sandwich, if the bread had been in better shape, but it still would have only been okay; not great. 

The truffle and sweet potato fries were, as you can guess, cold and actually not particularly well prepared. I think they were, at least for me, undercooked and sort of limp.  

Now, as for my sandwich.  First, it wasn't a sandwich. It also wasn't a salad, as there wasn't any lettuce. It was a bun less sandwich, or a protein style sandwich but in a bowl like a salad; sans the lettuce. I guess my primary issue is, it wasn't on the healthy side of the menu, it was on the happy side of the menu. Aside from that, nothing indicated it was not a sandwich; almost everything, on that half of the menu was a sandwich and nothing indicated otherwise (I've included a picture of the menu, you be the judge). It's redeeming quality was the generous inclusion of Bleu cheese, but aside from that it was a rather plain roast beef, an equally plain balsamic dressing, and a few overly ripe slices of tomato lacking in flavor. 

The only other redeeming quality was the cup they serve their beverages in, decent quality, with a nice lid, even a sturdy enough straw. I guess the worst part of the experience (if it could be worse and it was) is that we were vocal about our unhappiness and asked for the manager's name; Amanda was the name provided. Now, I mean vocal about our displeasure, not rude; despite this (if the evidence isn't already there) apparently customer service is not their strong suit. I'd have expected at least a polite apology from the manager, but alas she didn't even make an appearance. 

In summary, disappointing food, poor service, ambiguous menu, lousy experience; so bad I'm not sure I could convince myself to give them a second chance.",9,3,3

Came here on Sunday for lunch and it was packed. It took quite a while to place an order but the wait was worth it. Ordered the big parm sandwich which was delicious and juicy not dry. Also got the SkinnyFats punch which was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. Also tried the spudgetti which is basically a loaded baked potato in shredded form it was delicious and I think it's gonna be my go to dish from now on.,0,0,0

I wish that they would not only include calorie but also carbohydrate and nutritional value on their menu and website. Those of us doing Keto or paleo need a little bit more information than calorie content. I've eaten here multiple times and the food is pretty tasty. Unfortunately I found out that some of the foods I thought were good for me to eat doing keto were full of sugar even though they seemed like they would be an appropriate Keto meal. I like the food it's good and the prices aren't too over-the-top. I just need to know more about how skinny and how fat the food really is.,2,0,0

And that's why SkinnyFATS is great!

The ambiance is fun and casual with colorful art painted onto the walls. It is always crowded, at least when I've been there. This isn't really a sit down and eat and have them wait on you sort of place because of the constant flow of traffic and limited seating at this location (haven't been to their other one yet) but in spite of those things, I still give this place 5 stars and recommend checking it out.

Light, healthy meals made with fresh ingredients makes me happy... like the Mango Chicken bowl with brown rice adding some avocado and viola you have a solid lunch. This location seems a tad bit smaller than the other on Durango, but it does make up for having outlets at the bar seating area to plug in a laptop to work on the go as Durango does not have that.

While we were waiting though, we were able to have a cup of lemon water and have a copy of their menus to look at so we know what to order when we get to the cashier. 

My mom and I decided to share 2 waffles, the Waffle-Dopolis (something around these lines) and the REDiculous.

The Waffle-Dopolis was basically a pizza waffle. It was a plain waffle with mozzarella cheese, meat (I think ham), and tomatoes. The waffle was so soft, but not chewy! It really felt like I was eating a pizza. All the flavors blended really well together and I had no complaints.

The REDiculous was just as good. It was a red velvet waffle with cream cheese whipped cream, chocolate chips, blueberries, and raspberries with bacon on the side. The waffle as well was very soft and flavorful, and the fruits were sweet! My mom and I are not fans of strong cream cheese flavors, and were grateful that the cream cheese wasn't overly done and given in the right amounts. It wasn't too sweet and added the right amount of taste a red velvet anything would need.

Overall, along with our strawberry lemonade drink, we paid around $25. I have no complaints whatsoever about this place. Maybe they need more chairs, because every time I hear about this place, I always hear about how packed it is!

We figured we beat the rush and there would be no one there.  We were mistaken.  This place is the spot.   Every table was full and there was a steady flow the whole time we were there.   The place reminds me of Cali - fresh ingredients, modern, and great food with tons of selections between fresh made juices, smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items.

Thanks to Yelp, we ordered the secret off the menu Chicken and Waffles.  It wasn't your standard traditional soul food with meat on the bone.  They were more like tenders but it was delicious and we ate every bite of it.  The chicken held perfectly with the slightly crisp waffle.  There are more secret menu items - just check out the online website before you go...Shhhhh

We also ordered the Bonjour Brulee, egg white french toast with bunch of berries and turkey sausage.  It was part of the healthy breakfast section but it certainly made us feel like we ordered from the Happy section.

Last I had to get an order of the Slaw Chee.  Anything with my name in it such as Cheeburger Cheeburger, I HAVE to support.   The Slaw Chee tasted just like it should - the perfect amount of texture from the cabbage with the perfect symphony of flavors.

If you like to overpay for small amounts of food this is the place for you. I ordered a steak salad that came on spinach, which first of all if you know anything about spinach it wilts pretty fast so that's pretty weak when not mixed. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 110 lbs, if I order a salad and it doesn't fill me up I think that says something about the restaurant, especially since I hardly ever leave a place without a to-go box. On to the steak.. it was sliced very thin and could almost be considered crumbled, not good quality at all. It was a very sad excuse for a $12 salad. 

My husband's chicken sandwich came with his egg as ordered (lucky him), yet he still wasn't satisfied. He said it tasted very plain, basically no seasonings. He said RR would have been better, I didn't taste it so I don't know.

I ordered my salad the gentleman asked me if I would like to add avocado, I said yes, my husband ordered his, then we paid and sat down. After I get my food I realize they forgot my avocado, no big deal, I let him know. The runner instantly starts eyeballing our receipt on the table (which if I may add has no items listed just the total of $30), and lets me know that he can go double-check to see if I was charged for it and if I wasn't they would have to charge me. He comes back lets me know that we weren't charged and it'll be $1.08. Mind you my husband ordered a chicken sandwich that he's eating with his hands. They want him to dig into his wallet for $1.08 to put on a card.. I understand watching how much stuff you give away for free, but you also need to be aware of how you treat people.. we won't be back. 
On top of everything with the food it was cramped (not busy), loud, cold, and just generally an uncomfortable place (quite literally, the tables were terrible). The fact that the cashier had to read us each soda nozzle because there wasn't a list and they are too small to see, was very unnecessary. 

We paid $30.xx for a chicken sandwich and fries, a (pathetic) ""steak"" salad, and two sodas.

And the cinnutella also had no nutella they put chocolate with it instead. And it just tasted like eating a pile of fried sugar. Way too much sugar. I also got coffee and they were ever stingy with the sugar and creamer.

If you're a vegan... it wouldn't be the worst thing coming here but it's definitely not my first choice. They have quite a bit of options to choose from, but they all taste a bit too healthy for my liking. I love being healthy of course, but when I'm craving something sweet, savory, and delicious...healthy isn't really the word I want to use to describe my meal. I feel like their vegan options give you that classic ""oh yea that's definitely vegan"" vibe. I got the vegan BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST...oh my please do yourselves a favor and stay away from that. The bread they use is absolutely appalling imo. I don't understand why they can't just use regular vegan white bread or something, instead they went for a 100% whole wheat bran concentrated multigrain sand flavored bread. Just kidding I actually don't know what type of bread they used but it tasted like that to me. I believe they were trying to go for that healthier option for those who want to watch their weight but it kinda sucks that they automatically paired it with the only vegan french toast since not all vegans are into that type of taste. I also tried the AVOCADO TOAST. It was a little better than the french toast, probably my favorite thing ordered. But I have certainly had much better avocado toast elsewhere. Pita and hummus were average, although the pita was harder than I would have liked. The ""STEPHEN CURRY"" was a lot spicier than I thought it would be. It could be pretty good for those who like spicy foods but I'm not much of a fan.

I'm ordering that next time I go there :)
This isn't a cheap place but you pay for what you get. The portions could be for 2 people, its a lot of food so it's worth it. 
It's pretty cold in the restaurant and that would be the only downfall that I've noticed. 
The staff is really friendly and helpful.

There menu is an overload of goodness that it took me a minute to decide what to eat. The cheerful staff members were happy to bring that overload to a boiling point by mentioning secret menu items they also had. 

Finally I made the decision to go w\/ their version of nachos, the Hot Mess (Flour tortilla chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalape√±os, sour cream & jalape√±o ranch). Everything was SO tasty. I had my reservations about the chips, but I get that these is a healthier type of nachos. The size of the chips though was my main issue as they broke off while trying to gather all the ingredients on the chip. The chips were a bit bigger than the normal sized chips that come in a nacho setup. Other than that the flavors were quite tasty. 

I also got Hot Chix (Breaded buffalo chicken, bleu, pico, avocado & fried jalape√±o strips over romaine tossed in buffalo ranch) to go. Such a tasty salad. 

W\/ so many options to choose from this place is def one I will be going back to for more tasty treats. The atmosphere is so clean & full of energy. Love it!",0,0,0

More like, I've heard so many great things about this place and really wanted to check it out before I left. This night was one of the best decisions I made that day. 

Located in a pretty weird strip mall on dean Martin, next to Wendoh Media and Vegas Seven. The surrounding businesses are a bunch of auto shops and stuff. Very odd, however, it wasn't sketchy. I overheard their staff say there's another location opening up north. Sounds like they've hit some success and needed to expand! Speaking of their staff. The staff was super nice and personable. They recommended things to me, made sure to mention the specials and super accommodating . There were two tall guys and next to them, what seemed like a very short girl. Great team, nonetheless.

Overall, the place is a bit small. Grab a table for window seating fast! In this joint, there were decorated wooden paneling, tin roof panels, an electronic menu, a butcher block type counter, and dark wood floors. My impression was a very modern look with a backyard flair.  Here's what I had for dinner:

On special, the Parmesan Crusted Halibut for $10. A nice cut of halibut, pan fried with Parmesan, panko and coconut. It sat on a bed of pico infused brown rice and served with grilled yellow squash. Holy macro, this was AH-MAZE-ING! The fish was moist and flaky, The crust brought a crunchy element but wasn't heavy at all. The rice with pico brought a super clean taste and the soft squash brought the dish full circle

Tu-Nuts for $9.50.Spicy ahi & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w\/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli. We asked for the teriyaki on the side (it still tasted great without it). I LOVED THIS DISH!! Highly recommended :) The concept of using the cucumber as a boat was genius, but them you add in the spicy tuna, the crunchy and flavorful slaw and avocado, you've got a perfect start to your meal. The sriracha aioli, was definitely a great enhancement of the dish. SOOOO GOOD!

What I really loved about this place was the menu offered very healthy conscious food, the food comes with a lot of cultural diversity and the portions are huge! It's kind of located in an odd area of town, but trust me, soooo worth it! After a nice hike or dinner after the gym, SkinnyFATS will not disappoint. Check them out!",3,0,4

I can see how parking and ordering may become hectic at peak hours.  From its location and size, you'd be convinced it was a commercial office space in its past life.  Though it is 'cozy,' the lay out proves the space is used optimally, and the artistic details make for a unique setting.

Order at the counter, then grab a number and a seat.  The menu provides an interesting take and variety on [namely] American cuisine.  Me and my late lunch date tried something from the 'healthy' side and the 'happy' side.  The Slow Boat to China is essentially a chicken & cucumber salad, with a few other veggies, nuts, and a glaze that most closely resembled eel sauce.  It is presented as a boat (thus the name), and tasted like a California Roll.  I enjoyed it, though questioned how 'healthy' it really was on account of the sauce.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which were prepared to a crisp--and delicious! From the 'happy' side, we ordered the Benedict Burger with truffle fries.  It was rather well done, but still juicy, considering.  I am a sucker for eggs on a burger, so I liked it before I even tried it.  It had the usual veggie fixins plus avocado.  Not a burger I absolutely must have again, but a tasty, well made burger.  Likewise, the accompanying truffle fries were pretty good, but nothing different from any truffle fries I've tried before.  Granted, we were not so adventurous with our selections; We came more for necessity than foodie experimentation [and left very satisfied].  Next time, I will give one of their Philly Cheesesteak options a spin, as well as their loaded fries.  The photos and descriptions look amazing.

The portions are pretty large\/definitely shareable.  Bonus points for flavored ketchup options! The jalapeno one was my favorite.  Service was great.  Staff is friendly.  I would definitely take friends and family here.",2,0,0

I had heard about this place from a few friends, and as I was done eating the same old thing for dinners, so I decided to finally try SkinnyFATS.

The restaurant is small with about 8 tables and a long window bar with stools to sit at.  There is one TV to watch and the decor was hip with paintings on the walls of fruits and vegetables.

As soon as I walked in, the young lady (did not get her name) immediately knew I had never been there before...guess I stuck out like a sore thumb!  hahahaha

Anyway, she guided me through the menu explaining the differences between the Healthy (skinny) dishes and the Happy (fat) dishes.  I could even order breakfast if I wanted as it was served all day.

I settled on ""Berry the Steak.'  It is a flat bread with shaved NY steak, feta and goat cheeses, arugula, balsamic reduction, and blackberries.  I also grabbed a side salad and a soda.

The side salad, though simple, was delicious.  Lettuce, tomato, and a few other veggies with ranch dressing.

Free refills on the soda!  Can't beat Dr. Pepper!

The flat bread was delicious!!!!!!  Nice combo of sweet (berries and balsamic) and peppery (arugula).  There was also nice texture with the crunchiness of the flat bread and the soft warm creaminess of the cheeses.  My only critique is, and this is being picky, is that the flat bread was a little hard to cut with a knife so that it could be cut into more manageable pieces to eat.  I think maybe pre-cutting it into 4 pieces (it's a square shape) might be helpful.

The staff was extremely friendly and totally willing to answer questions about the menu and various dishes.  They gave me a number, I sat at a table, and then delivered it to me when the meal was ready.

I highly enjoyed the meal and the vibe and am looking forward to going back.

It was delicious, although messy. The mango relish really paired well with the ahi. The grilled chix was just ok for me. The chicken was a little tougher than I would have liked and the sauce was a tad sweet. But the battered chix (I can't remember the exact name) was better, with a nice crust. 

All the workers there were really nice. You can expect a wait (we went on what I thought was a super busy day, but they said that was actually a slower day). But as we waited, they made sure we were comfortable and sparked up conversation.

Based on some of the outstanding reviews about this place I was expecting quite a lot walking in. I was surprised at how cramped this place was; it can probably seat 20 at any given time. I was there during lunchtime, and thought the long line would at least be a marker of food worth waiting for. I was mistaken. Before I describe how underwhelming the food experience was, though, I do want to acknowledge the serving staff that was very attentive and friendly. 

The food on the other hand, was so underwhelming that I was tempted to give this place only a single star to correct it's misleadingly high Yelp rating. I tried the classic burger. I ordered it medium, and it came out completely well done. But that wasn't even the biggest issue, since there are many places that sell overdone but serviceable burgers. This place, on the other hand, insists on serving large half-pound slabs of gray beef atop boring buns with minimal toppings. The burger itself seemed to lack any seasoning, let alone a sprinkle of salt and pepper. If not for a squeeze of yellow mustard, I might not have eaten more than a few bites. The fries were not fresh and equally underwhelming. 

The chicken and waffles is okay, but when you serve something as simple as chicken and waffles, it needs to be spot on or unique in some way to stand out. Here, the waffles are like anything you'd find at a Holiday Inn breakfast buffet, and the fried chicken is hot and crispy but a tad dry. The smotherload is okay, but lacks acid and freshness, and the steak I ordered medium with the burrito also came out overdone. The multigrain protein pancakes here taste okay, but let's not kid ourselves, they don't taste any better than a hot stack of normal buttermilk pancakes at your local Denny's (or a location on the Las Vegas strip).

The price of the food itself is the last nail in the coffin, and with such a lackluster 11 dollar burger, I struggle to see what others rave about in their reviews. The food itself looks good and is certainly very photogenic, making it perfect for Yelp reviews, and the concept of the restaurant is pretty awesome, but poor execution overall really prevent me from giving this restaurant any higher than two stars.",2,0,0

They have a great variety of foods and drinks to order from. You have the choice to be ""healthy"" or ""happy"" of course I couldn't decide so I got one of each side haha. The only down side to my delicious meal was the wait time to receive our meal. While I was waiting I ordered fresh cold pressed juices. Being on a juice craze right now I was very pleased to see that they offer it. Id highly recommend this place!",1,0,0

The left side of the menu are the skinny dishes and the right side has the fat dishes. The calories are listed on the healthy side, though not on the fat side. Some of the calories for the healthy dishes are ridiculously low. They also have vegan dishes on both sides of the menu. Prices are in the $8 to $13 dollar range.

This place is about as hipster as it gets. The walls seem to be made from re-purposed wood and the small dining area is full of the hipster crowd. This is the type of place that focuses on organic, local ingredients and serves their togo food in compostable boxes. It's a pretty casual environment, and seems like a great place to grab lunch.

I got the spicy filet mignon sandwich and my wife got the steak breakfast burrito. We also got the cucumber asian chicken salad as an appetizer. The chicken salad was the only thing we ordered from the skinny side of the menu, and it was delicious. The chicken salad paired perfectly with the cucumber boat it is served in and was made even better knowing it had such a small caloric impact on us.

The breakfast burrito was very good and smothered in a gravy sauce. My sandwich was pretty good to, but it wasn't worth $13 considering the serving size. The filet was tender but I felt like the sandwich would be just as good with roast beef for a few dollars cheaper. I also got the pita bread and hummus for my side dish and I loved it.

I found this place to pretty intriguing and I want to come back and try some more of their original dishes, especially on the skinny side of the menu. My biggest criticism is that their prices seem to be a little too high considering their portion sizes seem a little small, which seems to be the trend at hipster places.

If you want to try some original and healthy dishes, this place is worth checking out. As someone whose looking to lose a few pounds myself, I want to come back. It's the perfect spot for people to go where someone is on a diet and the other person isn't.",1,1,2
