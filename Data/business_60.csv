If you do not plan to leave the casino much than this is a good choice.  The Rio and The Palms are also very good off-strip choices.

Pay attention to which tower you book.  That way you know which parking garage to use.  Otherwise you could have a mile long walk to your room at check-in.

We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  The rooms are average in size.  The decorations are modern with the obviuos rock style.  The beds are comfortable.

The casino floor is not that large, but there are some $5 tables for those on a budget.  There is a convenience store and a Starbucks inside.  There are a few decent places to dine.

The pool area is good.  There is even a small sandy beach area by the pool.  It would be nice if it was a bigger area, but it is fun none the less.  The pool area generally has a party atmosphere, especially on weekends.

As I said, if your goal is to spend any amount of time on the strip stay on the strip.  If you want to just hang out in the one place and party, then Hard Rock is for you.",2,0,0

The service is terrible. The staff is rude, especially the security. The security staff acts like you are bothering them if you ask them a question. The cashiers in the cage  are extremely rude, but not as rude as the valet attendants. The dealers are cool and so were the cocktail servers.

It does not matter how the rooms are, because the staff and the management is horrible. So, I do not need to review the rooms because I do not recommend that anyone should come here. This place used to be one of the best spots in Vegas to hang out and party. What a shame.",8,2,1

The food was great (everything we ate there was so good), the rooms were awesome, the atmosphere was spot on!  The only 2 downsides were that it's not close enough to the strip where you can just walk.  Trust me... we tried and it took us almost 40 min; granted my friend walks slow, however, the map showed it was only 2 blocks away, they failed to include the 5 blocks that are within each ""block"" and these are long blocks.  The maps are not to scale at all.  We took a cab to and from the strip which ran us $10 each way.  The second downfall was the whole Rehab thing... My friend emailed them a week or so before we got there and asked how much to go and they said around $20 for ladies and $50 for guys.  When we went to check in the lady told us that it's only that price if you are staying Sunday night and you spend a minimum of $100 (which includes the room, so that would have covered it if we stayed Sunday night too), however, we left that day.  She said that it would be $100 per person to go, sorry, but NO party is worth paying $100 just to get in.  So if you are staying there and want to go to Rehab, don't forget to stay Sunday night too.",0,0,0

The good - the hotel itself is beautiful, the room is very nice for the price that you pay. The decor was also very well done. 

The bad - the staff was not friendly at all. I don't recall a single thank you in the two nights from anyone who worked in the casino or hotel. This ranges from housekeeping, check in, casino floor or the bar. The nicest pepper worked in the sportsbook! In addition to that, we received a dirty glass with our drinks... and the worst part was... YOU CAN HEAR AIRPLANES COMING AND GOING ALL DAY LONG UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND STARTING AGAIN AT 7AM!!",2,0,0

We had issues with roaches, the AC was never fixed in our room so it was hot the entire time.  No ice machines worked.  I called the operator several times to get no answers but get transferred to the front desk.  We tried to eat at pink taco but they had a huge water leak so instead we went to 35 for happy hour.  We were denied service because we were wearing flip flops.  I have no issues with places having dress codes but the hostess was extremely rude about it.  And as she is telling us we can't enter their restaurant a woman walks out of it in flip flops and bikini top.  The managers response was if someone looks like they just finished playing golf they will overlook the dress code for them.  Not sure when women started playing golf in bikini tops and flip flops..... we also did happy hour at Ainsworth which was another horrible experience.  It was not even 1\/2 full and we sat closest to the waitress computer but sat there for 20 minutes without any service.  We had to go to the bar to order everything.  Plus the $5 drinks come in kid glasses.  After all these bad experiences the hotel moved us out of the casino tower to tower 3 to a ""fantastic room that will no doubt make us happy"".  I'm not sure what standards hard Rock has but we are definitely not on the same page as what's nice.  The room was OK and had working AC but was equivalent to a low end Hilton in a small town.  If you still plan to stay here, bring your own blankets, soap, shampoo etc because it is so low quality you won't want to use it.  The blanket is way too thick that even in the room with AC, I was sweating under the blanket and the AC was set on 62 degrees.  I will never stay in the Hard Rock Las Vegas ever again. The only positive review I can give is 35 did serve fantastic steak and if it weren't in such a terrible hotel I would probably eat there again.  But you have to look past the rude hostess.  Before you plan your trip call to see what will be open because all the clubs were closed.",1,0,0

What I love about the Hard Rock Cafe Hotels\/Casino, whether I'm a guest or just visiting, is the rock 'n' roll-themed casino resort featuring musicians' memorabilia on display. I enjoy looking at the different exhibits from different artists showcasing a piece from their own personal music collection. This particular location in Las Vegas had a lot of memorabilia from Prince. All the HRC hotels are different. The pool is named Nirvana Pool. Pretty cool name.

Our room was at the Casino Tower on the 3rd floor and the unit was nice, clean and comfortable. Our view of the back of the hotel was less desirable, though, but didn't bother me much. We had two standard queen beds. Housekeeping was thorough in getting our room in order and it was always pleasant to see a made up room each time we came back from the day's activities. The hallways are long but we were lucky that our room wasn't too far from the elevators. The other two towers were the HRH Tower and Paradise Tower.

Remember that there are two parking garages at this HRC, one at the East Harmon Avenue entrance and the other on Paradise Road. I mention this because on our first night we parked at the Harmon garage and the following morning we came looking for our car at the Paradise garage. We thought our car was stolen. The garage on East Harmon Ave is the original garage and is older. 

We were always out and about that we didn't get a chance to enjoy the hotel's amenities nor the restaurants! Not even watch Magic Mike Live! (okay, scratch Magic Mike). There is a Dunkin' Donuts in the premises just on the first floor from where our elevators were. That was about the only place we purchased anything here. I don't mind staying here again. The staff was friendly and helpful when we needed assistance.

Pros: The room was gorgeous. Very pretty, very roomy, the bed is super comfy and the view was decent.

Cons: Upon checking in, their systems were down. We didn't get to check in until 9pm, after we had a nice fancy dinner in our t-shirts and shorts. The built-in radio system in the room didn't work, the shower head was very poor quality and also broken. The bathroom was very pretty but 2 of the lights didn't even work and the toilet room didn't have a fan.

I would definitely give them another chance based on value price, room beauty and comfort, but they need to get their stuff together with the computers and the shower heads.",2,1,1

They must have stepped up their game, or the people writing them were diva's.  I've been through Vegas 40 or 50 times in the past 10 years and this is my first stay at the Hard Rock.  

I won't stay anywhere else unless they give me a damn good reason to.  We stayed in the HRH tower, had the view of the planes taking off an landing, We had a King Suite for an Unbelievable price of $290 for 5 days.  The bed was UN-FRIGGING-BELIEABLE!!!  2 TV's, GREAT room service, Super cool staff except for a waiter in the Mr. Lucky's that I wanted to bitch slap.  Everyone else - regular folk who like to smile and make it happen for you.  My wife & I were not just a number.  

It was Mrs Caruso's first time in Vegas, so we went over to the strip, up to the old part of town, and just generally had a good time, but in spite of going through all the other casino's, we'd come back to the Hard Rock and look at each other as we walked in, and said """"home"".  Because it was for us.  Christina, who was our 1am casino waitress seemed to intuitively know when to chat, when to stop by to check on us, and even refused a tip with a smile, saying she was ok.  Nicole, our Check out gal, was phenominal in making everything smooth and seemless for us.  Santo's, the Valet from Melbourne was a Great reference for my wife to help illustrate some of the differences between Vegas service, & Australian service (which is almost non-existant).  My wife, is also Australian, and we currently live in Brisbane.  

If you've made it this far in my review, you know the rest of the story.  We had a great time, it's a Great hotel, and it's made that way by the people that work there.  I highly recommend it here.  We won't be staying anywhere else.",1,1,2

I was looking forward to a nice weekend but the Hard Rock did not live up. For those of you considering, DO NOT go to the pool party! You have to go in this underground parking lot and wait in line. There are so many rules. You can bring in any bags so I had to pay $10. Then the lady emptied out every little thing in my purse, there's no gum, no cough drops, no nail polish. What made me really upset is that I take medication and they wouldn't let me bring it in. When I told them I needed to have it on me, they started to read the bottle and then asked ""What time did you last take it? Well here it says...etc etc"" Unless you're a doctor you shouldn't restrict anyone from taking their medication. It's honestly more intense than the airport. I would say this to the Hard Rock staff: It's just a pool people! You take the fun out of it with all the security and rules. Once you get to the pools, unless you paid for a cabana, there are no regular chairs or shade to sit by. So I didn't stay long and thought I'll just go up to the room and chill...but the music is blaring so loud from the pool that you can hear it in your room LOUD. This was around 12pm, and the music doesn't get turned off till 7pm. I was so looking forward to just being in the room but I could not relax. That was probably the most disappointing thing that I wasn't able to just chill. The weekend night vibe at the hotel is kind of slow not much going on there. They need a cool bar or something. The one positive thing I have to say are the beds. 5 Stars on the beds and bedding other than that, sorry Hard Rock :(",0,0,0

The rooms are pretty good.  They are decorated very sexy but there were a few little things that could have used repair, such as the wall plugs were a little loose and rattley.  Be warned, they have vibrators and lube in the mini-bar, so if you have little kids, probably not the best.

I definitely think that the pool brings in a younger crowd.  I didn't go to the pool, but there were so many guests there in their early twenties, clearly coming from the pool and highly intoxicated and loud that I think the hotel could do without. 

I do recommend eating at the Pink Taco inside the Hard Rock while you are there.  Very good Mexican Food.

I think its a great hotel, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people over thirty and definitely not to people bringing kids.  However, if you are in your twenties, this is the spot.  The guests that were there in the appropriate age range were having the time of their lives.

If you are from out of town, which I assume most people in Vegas are, please note that this is not on the actual strip.  It is really close, but you will have to take a cab ride to and from.",1,0,0

Not to mention that in theory, you never have to see any white trash either.  Brilliant.  For some reason the casino floor was 75% guys last Friday...no complaint for a group of girls there for a bachelorette weekend...just a little bit bizarre to me.
The staff was surprisingly friendly.  Even though they couldn't accommodate our request for a 2 queen bedroom.  Instead we had one king and had to ask for a roll-away bed.  But the rooms are definitely big enough for it not to matter.

WORD TO THE WISE, THIS HOTEL IS NOT ON THE STRIP! CAB IS NEEDED!

Positives:
- Really friendly staff at check-in and the cleaning staff
- Close to airport
- Free Wi-Fi; good connection most times (better than other hotels I've stayed in) and they do offer a premium connection for an additional fee
- Allowed early check-in (believe we got there around 1pm)
- Clean and comfortable room
- Great artwork and music memorabilia
- AWESOME SERVICE at Pink Taco! Great Food!
- Stop at Fuel Bar in the morning for a quick bite to eat; reasonably priced
- Great pool atmosphere!!!!!

Negatives:
- Waitresses in Casino are skimpy when taking drink orders and are very hard to flag down
- Shuttles alternate day-by-day, one day it drops you off southside on Strip and the next it drops you off northend (Fashion Show Mall)
- Shower leaked, really should be fixed but could have just been our room. Cleaning services did a good job of cleaning shower anyways
- WAS NOT IMPRESSED with Lucky 7's nachos, pretty much cheese whiz on chips
- Not a huge casino
- One pool was closed all the time we were there; long hike through casino to open pool",0,0,0

- There's some construction going on right now and you cannot enter the parking structure directly from the front entrance, but they didnt' put any signs up telling how to get to the structure. (or maybe i was just blind?)
- right when you step in the hotel from parking structure, it smells like wet kitchen towel... seems like it's cuz of the wet paint smell combining with the food smell from pink taco and AJ's steak house, it was quite unpleasant.
- Got upgraded to a large pool view room right in the center. I guess it would be nice if it's August, but not so much for November.
- Bathtub is clogged, water pressure changes depending on your neighbor's useage of water (this does not even happen in my old SD apartment!!! let alone a ""nice' hotel),  very old style heater in room (the non digital ones you have to spin the dial), very nice TV but does not work properly - they really need to fix their channeling system.
- It was a busy Saturday for Vegas and no line for Body English at midnight. (that must mean something ... )

It provides them with a captive audience who is growing more impatient by the minute, more conducive to sell limos. This also provides them more time to screen the crowd for people headed to strip clubs.

Another time, we had a suite with surround sound speakers with it's own DJ playlist and ipod dock. The suite also had a shower room the size of a big walk-in closet! Shower Party! 

Also I think along with Encore\/Wynn, they had the most comfortable beds out of all the beds in Vegas. It was literally like sleeping on a cloud.",2,1,2

This was not my first time visiting Vegas but this was the first time that I had the opportunity to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. I arrived a day after my friend so I did not get to experience the check in process. On the day I arrived I did see that there was a steady long line at the check in desk. 
The hotel itself was quite large and several casino areas along with a few restaurants. The hotel is located about two lengthy blocks from the strip which would take about  10 -15 minutes to walk depending on how fast you are. The hotel was divided up into several different towers - we stayed in the paradise towers on the 5th floor. The rocker theme was evident throughout the hotel as well as the rooms. I was able to see most of the hotel because our tower was the farthest tower to get to. To access the hotel elevator you need always need to carry your key card because without it the elevator will not get you to your floor. During my stay I arrived many times to the elevator and found people waiting for someone with a card to get them access upstairs SMH. 
The room itself was also decorated with a obvious hard rock theme but it was very cozy. The beds were so plush and comfortable that it was difficult at times to get up. I could sleep all day in that bed. The view from our room was horrible but it was always quiet. The lighting in the room was not the best I must say because none of the lighting was bright. Also the darkening drapes did very little to keep out the morning light so sleeping late was difficult. One helpful aspect was that the phone could be used as a charging station which came in very handy but there were plenty of outlets for use. The bathroom area design was very annoying to me because the toilet was enclosed with the shower. The shower itself was fine as far as pressure and temperature. I also loved the double sinks because it made things convenient for two people staying in a room.
Another thing that I did not appreciate about the room design was all of the snacks on display as well as the fridge full of drinks. The fridge would've been useful if it wasn't for the sensors that would cause your room to be automatically billed when touched. The snack display was also the same way - it took up a lot of space and you had to really avoid bumping or touching it in order to avoid automatic charges which I thought was stupid. Feel free to charge me if an item is missing but not if its just moved or touched!
I thought the housekeeping services were pretty descent until we asked for extra wash cloths one day for our room. The housekeeper made it obvious that we were interrupting her or causing her some delay. She gave us the wash cloths but she literally threw them at us and then ran - yes you read right - ran back into the room she had been working in! We laugh so hard that we couldn't be pissed - maybe she was running late completing her duties.
There is a daily resort fee that covers the wifi service, complimentary shuttle as well as other services. I was the one left to check out and it was hassle free. Your also given an option of having your final bill emailed or printed out for you. I would definitely return in the future just for those comfy beds.",3,0,2

There is a CVS and strip mall with eats across the street. They do charge a resort fee of $28 which sucks especially since only 2 of the 5 pools are open for some reason. I have no idea why but plan on asking when we check out. Parking is free which is a plus but we only had a car for 2 days. So the crazy part. The hotel room seemed pretty nice but no fridge or microwave, they forbid outside food. Seriously. They have a tray with water, candy, etc u can buy. Beware!!! It's on a sensor so if u pick it up to look at it they will charge u unless u set it down within 30 seconds. WTH? That's hardcore, I have children that could pick it up & did. Luckily we set that puppy down before being charged $9 for 4 mini size candies. Insane! Overall meh stay. Our shower door leaked water every time we used it so that sucked. To not have access to all the pools is enough for us to never stay here again. I've taken some pics hope they are useful. Just meh for us.",1,0,0

Playing card games on the machines at the circle bar is always pretty profitable and the it's the only casino I've ever won at on a slot. 

I've yet to have a bad time at wasted space and love seeing concerts at the venue. The pool is amazing (as long as its not a Rehab day. Too crowded for my taste)

No complaints about the room. Beds are comfy, showers have warm water and drain properly. What more do you really need in Vegas! 

Not a huge fan of the restaurants in the hotel, but the generous pours in the mixed drinks tend to alleviate hunger pangs.

Not my first time here and not my last! I even head to Hard Rock In San Diego! 
Came and stayed and  definitely played! We had a great time and had a good experience. From check in to check out. The service was quick and helpful. Rooms were clean, and roomy! Have to love a comfortable bed!! We went to the pool (REHAB!!!!) , night time at Body English & The Joint!  and had a few bites to eat as well (Mr. Lucky's) in the wee hours of the morning.

Other than that great experience, nothing else about the casino really excited me to come back much. There is some great memorabilia around and that's nice to see. It's just off the Strip. It has ample free parking and is pretty easy to navigate. I've been to other Hard Rock establishments in other cities such as hotels and restaurants, but somehow those felt more authentic than this facility. I even like the cafe on the Strip a little more, but I guess this is just Vegas after all . I don't mean to be harsh or discouraging, but being a musician, I expected more wow. There seemed to be a lot of people loving the place but it fortunately wasn't overcrowded like some of the other Casinos. 

It's definitely worth a visit though. I'd be interested to know what vibe other people get from this place.",4,2,3

The art in my room in the HRH tower #1 was Debra Harry, Tina Turner and some other female vocalist I didn't recognize. The in HRH mag and other propaganda is above average. 

The casino is better than some others I've seen. The memorabilia is worth checking out. They could use better identification\/mapping for the amenities. I get it, they want you lost in the casino but I found it easier to go outside and walk around the block to get back the the HRH tower. 

The uniforms are too informal. I had a hard time distinguishing the staff from the clientele. Maybe they should put everyone in Andy Frain outfits or would that harsh your buzz.

We checked in on Sunday 8\/27 and the casino was very crowded and the check-in lines were long. We checked in around noon and was told that our room was ready, but we couldn't get in it until 3 pm at check-in time, BUT, we were told that if we pay $10, we can get in our room early. So, let me get this straight, our room was ready, but if we pay, we can get in our room a few hours early for a room thats empty?? Fortunately, we just said no thanks, then the check-in hostess left for 10 seconds, then came back and told us we could go up and they would waive the fee. How about just offering us that in the first place if its ready?!?! I will say the girl that checked us in was very nice.

Next, the bad part. I guess they let us into our room early so that we could keep the huge cockroach that was in our bathroom company, yuck! This was also one of the ""newly renovated"" rooms and we were on the 9th floor!! 

Then, we had to call maintenance to have the sink repaired as it would drain extremely slow.

Most of clientele in the casino was extremely rude, drunk and obnoxious! The McGreggor\/Mayweather fight was the night before, so the jerkoffs must have still been drunk as they were very loud in the casino and constantly using profanity for every other work out of their toilet mouth. I also constantly heard the word n****r and many racial slurs from alot of these idiots as well that made us feel very uncomfortable. 

We went to the Duncan Donuts restaurant in the hotel for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. The place was filthy! The trash can was overflowing with trash. The staff finally emptied it, but it should never get to that point. The tables were dirty and food crumbs were all over the floor both in the kitchen and dining area.

My biggest advice is to get the ""Mountain View"" rooms as opposed to any room that faces the pool.  The poolside rooms located near the nightclub are far from soundproof, so you'll hear the BPM's of the thumping bass 'til 3am or 4am, then it starts back up around 9am as the staff preps the pool.  So, if you're a light sleeper and want to have a bit of serenity in your room to relax without feeling you're in a nightclub, then request the Mountain View room.",1,0,0

They tried to charge me for items in the mini bar that I didn't even touch or open. There were only two wash cloths in the bathroom, I'm not using the same cloth to wash my ass and face, and it's two of us. The television service was horrible, TV kept pixelating and skipping.

First, our RESERVED room in the HRH tower was magically ""downgraded"" to a room in the casino tower. Next, due to the casino tower selling out (EDC weekend), we were then sent to the paradise tower and told the "" upgrade"" would be free. We did not receive housekeeping services for 3 days, which is pretty gross when the trash is full and you have wet towels.
Upon check out, I recieved a ""bill"" for nearly $800. ( I was an invited guest and comped!) I was told I had to now pay for the room due to demand over the time I was there!? I was then sent to VIP services where I showed the email where I was to be comped. They said sorry and refunded $50 of my resort fees.

This is one of the only places that you can sit at a table, the dealers will talk with you and you actually get service.

CONS
-Super annoying to get to and from the strip
-Worst service EVER, don't even bother asking employees if you forget your room number, they won't give it to you.
-Tattoo parlor in the hotel, REALLY? Way to objectify tattoo culture by tattooing drunken tourists (I can say this because I have tattoos)
-Creepy lurker dudes everywhere, people passed out in the hotel

The worst thing about this place is that I arrived to my room only to find EVERY. SINGLE. LIGHT. OFF. and it took about 5 hours to get my room light fixed.  By then, I was so annoyed I opted to stay at the Wynn for a night, 5 STARS! to that place.  I really didn't spend much time at the hotel, but everytime I did I ended up irrated and annoyed.  Their numbering system for rooms is also super frustrating, especially when coming back to your room at 5 am blitzed beyond belief.  The only positive things I have to say about this place is that I really liked the photography they had on display, and their John Varvatos store was A+.  Other than that, NO THANK YOU.",0,1,0

It was also pretty affordable compared to some of the other Vegas hotels.  Another perk is that they offer free calling from their land lines to anywhere in the US!

It was a work trip, so I don't have anything too crazy to share about my stay, but I did take advantage of the workout room, room service, and a few of the hotel coffee shops and restaurants.  I also stuck my head into their stores... very cute stuff, especially lingerie, but I didn't make any purchases.

I went for a comedy show at Vinyl which was great, it was the before and after the show that had me pretty annoyed. I was early so I decided to play the slot machines and when I was ready to cash out and go meet my friends for pre drinks and the show the machine said hand pay only so I hit the service button and started my wait. You'd think on any normal Saturday night there would be many slot attendants but after 15 mins waiting a flagged down a security guard who told me that all of them are busy.. ok??? Can you not help??? Next a waitress finally walks by and I order a drink and ask what's going on she says she doesn't know. A lady walks by 5 mins later and says ""oh they are still down?"" I asked her to explain just as the waitress came back to also inform me the computer system went down for the casino and every slot machine must be hand paid. 25 mins in I call the customer service from my cell and ask them to send someone to my machine. 45 mins I call again please send someone to my machine. No announcements are being made no one is putting signs up, nothing. After waiting an HOUR!!!!! (no pre drinks or good seats at the comedy show now) They come over and hand pay and say sorry... SORRY at this point screw you. So I enjoy the show come and after I see people playing and think to myself maybe it's working the lady who hand paid me said they were back online. Guess that was my mistake cause I played again only to once again not get my money out of the machine by pressing cash pay. I feel like Hard Rock were thieves Saturday night. what's a person going to do after waiting forever not to get their money either walk away with it still in the machine or play it down as far as they can. I can say second time around they did get to keep what I left I wasn't going to continue to wait yet again for an hour. What Hard Rock should have done was let people know in advance that they were having issues and let it be the guests decision if they want to play and be hand paid for a slot machine. But it seems greed took over instead and it might have even been a ploy to make some money... are they that hard up to take it out of the guests experience???

I am going to start this review by saying that I hard to please and very opinionated. When I love something, I will say so, but when its bad, I will scream it!  I dont write reviews often, but it must be really bad or really good for me to post! I am very sincere about my experiences. just an FYI. THIS WAS WORSE THAN BAD! 
        Checked in at Noon yesterday, room was not ready. They sold me an upgrade to the new HRH suite tower. Said they would call when ready. I called at 2:23pm cause had not heard, room still not ready (an entire tower of rooms and not a single 1 was available?) Finally at 9pm I went to hotel and got in room. Went down and gambled (dealers friendly- only plus). When got back to room...EVERYTHING went bad! Ready??? There were HAIRS in the bathtub- long black hairs (I am a redhead btw), couch was covered in black spots, there was no batteries in the tv remote, half the bathroom lights did not work, phone kept beeping til unplugged it (so couldn't call down to guest services and complain about everything and since was almost 1am didnt want to go down and bitch as it was late,) and the kleenex box was dead empty.         The WORST thing.... oh my god, I shudder thinking about it.... the next am, after sleeping on the right side of the bed, woke up and pulled back the comforter.............there were BLACK pubic hairs and rocks in the bed under the comforter, all over the bed. I am a redhead, they were NOT my hairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WAS SOO SKEEVED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Each thing adds up, but all of it means they did not clean room, check the electronics nor care about customer service. I went down and spoke with someone in VIP services, and they did not CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Other stuff happened as well, was told that days food and drinks would be taken care of and a manager from hotel would be by our cabana at pool to talk to me....NEITHER of these things happened! I have pictures...... they will be sent to channel 13 to investigate..... Also- checked out 24 hours early, thats how bad it was!!!!!!!!   All I can say is....................STAY AWAY!

The first time we left L.A. at 8PM on a Friday night and booked the room on our way around 10PM.  We got in around 1AM and stood in line for 30 minutes (no idea why so many people were checking in that late).   We finally got to the front and they said we were in the wrong line and made us wait in the suite line.  We finally made it though that line and they said ""looks like we gave away your room, but we can give you the same room with a singe king size bed"".  We said that didn't work for us as there were three of us guys and specifically asked for two queens and a roll away three hour ago.  They said there was nothing they could do, so I asked for a refund and I'd stay somewhere else.  They said ""we can't do that"".  I asked for a manager and they said I'd have to wait in the 30 minute line again to speak with one.  

Bad experience #2
I went there this past week for business arrive at 11AM.  I stood in a 10 minutes line this time to find that my room was not ready.   They said it would be ready around 1PM.  We went to our conference and came back around 1:30PM.  They said they only had one room ready and not the two we asked for.  So we took that room and worked on the over priced $14\/user\/day wifi in the room.  They said our second room would be ready by 3:30PM.  4PM I tried to get my room and they said it was still not ready, so I waited until 7PM before getting a room.  We wanted to stay one more night for the conference, but they said all rooms were booked and we needed to leave by 11AM.


My other complaints:
- $14 wireless
- $15\/day resort fee (which is for the gym, newspaper, and other spa.  I said no thanks, but they said I have to pay for it)
- If you open the mini fridge or even bump the water or snacks they charge you and come by asking if you want more.  
- It's far from the strip meaning you can pay $30 round trip to the strip.

If you can't pick out a hooker in 30 seconds at the HR then you're asexual as an amoeba.  

2. Pool parties all weekend - if you don't mind wading through muddy brown water full of drunken lusty crowds of thrusting painfully beautiful spring break escapists all trying to have sex with each other.  Was this what ancient Rome was like near the end?

3. The people really are better looking here, mostly Socals, mostly fit and tan and Aryan and OC\/Hills Abercrombie.  Too bad they're also mostly deuche bags!

Once I got to my room which was on the pool side the view was great! However it sucks being on that side if you want to sleep in because they do sound checks at 9:00 in the morning! Around 12:00 noon they blast the music to the point where you can't even hear your TV . But heh your in Vegas. After coming back from the pool I ordered some room service the food was horrible. All an all I give this place 4 stars rather than my previous 5. I know there are upgrading the suites so I'm pretty sure they will start upgrading the regular rooms thankgod!

This is a place where the door hangers instead of saying ""Do Not Disturb"" say ""Tied Up"" with a picture of handcuffs.  This is a place where you can flip through the room service book and find ready to order sex kits complete with boobie tassels and tickle feathers.  This is the place where your mini bar snack area has stuff like snickers mini's, skull candy headphones and ""pleasure"" kits filled with condoms and lube samples.  The beds sit very low to the ground.  There are no Bibles in the dresser drawers.

Speaking of beds, ohmahgah amazing comfortable!!!  Our beds had goose down comforters and even though Vegas had experienced a cold front in mid-November that put the nighttime temps at 35 degrees we still burned up like an oven under the goose down.  HRH has my favorite bed so far out of every place I have ever stayed in Vegas (and that is a lot of places--including the overrated Bellagio).  

There are 2 main towers at the HRH:  The original Casino tower and the newer Paradise tower.  Even though the Casino tower is older I picked it for two reasons:  1.  It is closer to the main lobby meaning you don't have to go on an excursion to get to your elevator like you do in the Paradise tower.  2.  It has french doors that allow you to open up to your un-walkable balcony so you can smell the mountain air or peek out at any neighbors who may have their french doors open too.  Paradise doesn't have that.  Our room was on the top (11th) floor which was nice as we didn't have people stomping up and down on top of us.

Which brings up a point: this is a rock and roll hotel.  Though it has lost some of its original luster in later years the Hard Rock caters to the young, rock and roll crowd.  These people may get noisy.  Don't come here for peace and quiet.

The hotel itself is filled to the brim with lots of neat rock and roll memorabilia from The Beatles to Elvis to the Rolling Stones.  It is fun to walk around an take in the sights.  Hard Rock also has several restaurants such as Nobu, Pink Taco and the newer 35 Steaks + Martini's plus MORE.  The Joint concert venue is also located inside the Hard Rock and is host to some really great music acts so be sure to catch a show there.  It is nice to be able to just walk from your hotel room straight into the music venue without having to go outside.

I want to come back in the summer months and swim in the pools as HRH is famous for their swimming pools.  The rooms here can run from an affordable $40 a night to several hundred a night depending on what is going on.  The Friday night we stayed we were able to do early check-in.  If you need to park your vehicle the parking garage is included in the mandatory $25 a day ""convenience fee"" the hotels on the strip are now charging.  Hard Rock is not located on the strip so be prepared to walk 3 or so blocks if you want to be in on the strip action.  

The Hard Rock IS close though to my favorite dive bar in Vegas where you might be able to catch a local thrash metal or punk band:  The Double Down Saloon.  Enjoy!",3,1,4

The rooms are gorgeous with the lay out, decor, and bathroom set up.  Our room was on the pool side so waking up to music blasting at the pool can be an annoyance for people who are sensitive to noise early in the morning\/afternoon.  
There is also a Starbucks for guests who need their morning caffeine fix.  

Be careful not to touch anything in the mini bar even to pick up and examine because they are sensitive and will charge automatically.

For a Sunday night we only paid $60 for the room in the Paradise Tower. However they do charge a resort fee of $17 for the gym (which I did not use) and the pool (which is amazing but closed for the season). Lame fee.

They do have something great though - the pool and you HAVE to have a cabana.  Nothing feels more decadent than being waited on hand and foot.  The water is nice and cool too (especially nice after basking in the sun).  Definitely worth a trip back, but I like the rooms at the Cosmo better.",0,0,0

While this hotel isn't on the strip, it's location is still great, and the pool is wonderful. Especially loved the Relinquery Spa..excellent back massage, beautiful and clean facilities-very much enjoyed the dry sauna and whirlpool.  Room was spacious and very clean. Courteous and helpful staff. Parked our car here easily, as there was much parking accessible. Mr. Lucky's is a great addition to this hotel-opened 24\/7 and offering lots of classic (and delicious) comfort foods. Would definitely come back!",0,0,0

Now, the rooms are much more luxurious, including an ipod docking station allowing you to play your tunes throughout the bedroom and bathroom.  The studio suite is stylish, modern yet with that warm romantic feel making it a perfect place for a get away with your love (or lover)  The food is steadily improving as Culinary Dropout, 35 Steaks and Martinis, FU, Pink Taco and a revamped Mr. Lucky's offer excellent food.  The Ainsworth is a hip club (but don't eat there) with reverse karaoke (you pick the song, the regular singer sings it) on Fridays.  Rooms at the HRH range between 30-150 per night depending on your method of booking and the conventions in town but you can usually find a suite for 50-70 on hotwire or travelocity.  The staff is always friendly and offer upgrades at checkin depending on availabilty, for a fraction of the price to book them separately.

The casino is smallish and dark but lit up by a wide variety of slots. BIG PLUS - IT DOESN""T SMELL LIKE THEY DIPPED THE HOTEL INTO AN ASHTRAY WHEN THEY BUILT IT.  It is hard to find tables during crowded nights  so keep your money and head to the pool\/rehab bar for eye candy and tunes. 

My biggest beef with the HRH is the Joint.  Oh, I like seeing an act there, but the entrance to the joint is in the middle of the hall from the main parking to the casino.  There is a small hallway there and when there is a big event, usually heavy metal, or some kind of punk band, you have to push your way through throngs of concert goers as they rarely have organized lines.

I also wish they offered a better gaming card.  The offers I get are either a few dollars off restaurants or play $20.00 use 10$ freeplay.  

Still, for a reasonable getaway right in the middle of my hometown, you can't beat the Hard Rock.",4,0,0

There was a long line at check-in, which wasn't exactly how I wanted to spend my first thirty minutes in Las Vegas. The people ahead of me were incredibly drunk. Check-in seemed fine until I got to my room and the  key didn't work. I walked my luggage back down the hall to the elevator, then back to the registration area. I stood in the key line because it was much shorter. The guy didn't even apologize, but gave me two new key cards. I trudged back to my room and they didn't work either. I then stood in the key line again for at least ten minutes. The guy at the desk called the manager and they determined that the lick needed a new battery and I was given a different room in Casino Tower.

When I got off the elevator, I could hear bass in the hallway. It became much louder when I opened the door to my room. I had a pool view, which meant the music and shouting were so loud that I couldn't take a phone call or nap during the day. It was quiet by the time I got home most nights, although for some reason on Wednesday the music was blaring through a sound system after 11PM. I could hear the music while wearing earplugs. When I called the front desk, I was told the party would last until 1 AM.

When I arrived to the hotel on my last evening, I went to the desk to ask about check-out. Six employees were standing at computers. The person in front of me was being helped, and four employees walked away. The one that was left signaled it would be a minute, then walked away. Eventually, I was able to ask my question.

The terrible customer service was really jarring compared to the rest of my experience in Las Vegas.

If you've made it this far,  the only nice things I can say are that the double queen room was spacious and there's a large bathtub if you wanted to take a bath. The restaurants I tried were great as well, but you can visit them while staying at a hotel that takes better care of its customers.",5,1,0

The all suite tower was rad, and the room was way sexy--you can tell that this place was designed for men, and I mean that because everything in the restroom is glass (except where the toilet is), so you can see someone shower, get ready or take a bath from the bedroom.

Everything was kept clean and eight (yes, 8) of us stayed in the one room with just two queen beds, one blow up mattress and the couches that were in the living room area.  I ended up being $33\/person each night which was freakin' amazing.

Everyone was very sweet EXCEPT for the beezy at the pool; there are a few pool areas and we were at the pool with the beach where they do rehab starting in April, just minding our own business and tanning in those chairs that are half submerged when some chick came and took the towels that were covering our faces from the sun.  She told us that we were not allowed to have towels in the pool and instead of giving us the option to, oh I don't know, put the towels with the rest of our stuff, she just took them and ran off.

Uhhhhh, wtf?


Other than the crazy pool beezy, we had a good stay at this ""off the strip"" hotel.  It's a $12 cab ride--including tip--to get to Caesar's from the HRH tower, but it's worth it to stay in the badass room and tan on the beach.",2,3,0

Some of the newer restaurants were ok, but not enough to bring me back. The pool was closed due to bad weather and Sunday it cleared up, but the pool was going to close anyway.

The bed was comfy but smelled terrible like the staff never changed the sheets or pillows. Honestly the whole bed smelled like body odor and sweat. We had to contact the front desk about this problem and it took them around 1. Hr to send someone to fix it. And on top of that the shower smelled terrible like the water coming out of the shower smelled bad. Not to add to the fact that there was semen stains the glass walls of the shower.

Price is a huge factor in this rating - I was lucky to get my room for just under $70 because of the $100 off Orbitz Cyber Monday deal...  THEN, Lady Luck continued to smile upon me when I arrived to a fully-booked hotel, and was upgraded to the Celebrity Suite, which came with its own pool table.

But huge discount and upgrades aside, comparing the $150 rate to other comparable hotels on the strip during that busy weekend:

Pros:
- Divey bar at Pink Taco
- Promising swimming pool
- CVS across the street
- You don't need to deal with sh*tty Strip traffic to get to the hotel

Cons:
- Low-energy casino floor; not many people hanging around
- If you're planning to dine or drink\/club on the strip, then it's less convenient

You should have a general idea of what you're looking for in a hotel when coming to Vegas, as there are PLENTY of options.  I like this hotel, and the staff was very friendly, but it's really important for me to be walking distance to the clubs\/pool party I plan to attend (Marquee, XS).  I don't want to have to deal with sitting in a cab to get from Point A to Point B when I'm trying to maximize my time and fun, so I don't mind paying a premium to actually stay at the Cosmo or Wynn.

But, for those that are looking for lower budget, and a spot away from the hustle and bustle, this is a decent option.  And I'm a fan of the rocker vibe they have here (dark & metallic).",2,0,1

I went to LV with a couple of friends and they wanted to stay here. I'd stayed before, but it had been awhile so I agreed to it.

The room was probably the best thing about the hotel. We stayed in a suite and it was admittedly quite nice. I am a hotel snob so if I admit it was nice, it really was. I am hard to please. 

Leaving the hotel room was a totally different story. We went down to the pool (no cabana the first day) and good lord was I ever reminded of my first year of college! Simply put, the whole experience really was some never ending frat party. I hate to admit this as it just means that I have yet another review that proves I have officially reached old fart status in my ripe old 20s. The cabanas are great so if you have the means, reserve one. (Note, if you're with a group of your girlfriends and tell them that, they may comp. it!) 

Someone mentioned that security is really strict here and I agree with it... however I do think that is due to the fact that this hotel attracts your typical MTV Spring Break type crowd (aka never ending frat party) and thus, it rubs off on to all patrons. Just something to keep in mind.

Only issues I have ever had is room service getting out meal completely messed up, which they comped us for, and sometime you can hear to music from the pool area at 09:00 am. When I want to sleep in the last thing I want to hear is Snoop Dog. 

The rooms are clean. It doesn't smell like smoke like some of the other hotels do.  They have a Starbucks which is real nice. And they have an awesome players club where you can win prizes. I am only about $600.00 away of game play time until I earn that Hard Rock Hotel min backpack. HA HA.

We have stayed here nearly every summer for eight years, and have been satisfied with our experiences thus far.  It has always been very simple - no special treatment really, but not drama either -- Until now.  From the get go, we were told that we would be called once our room was available, as we preregistered at 10am.  No biggie.  We just killed time by walking around and stopping for a drink at Culinary Dropout.  By the time 1pm rolled around, I figured I should check on the room to see if it was ready.  When I asked about the room, the lady at the front desk said that it had been ready for a while.  I realized that they were busy (it was a Saturday after all), so I wasn't going to make a stink about the no call.
We got a room in the Casino Tower with a view of the pool - clean and simple - which we were completely okay with.  
The next day, four of my family members came into town.  I had recommended the Hard Rock Hotel to them, which I was kind of nervous about, because they usually stay in the higher end hotels.  We all booked rooms in the Casino Tower several months ahead of time, and ended up in three different towers.  My sister was given a room in the Paradise Tower, which she was not happy with, and my brother and his wife were upgraded to a suite in the HRH Tower, which they loved.  
By the time Monday rolled around, I had booked a pool villa suite in addition to all of our rooms just for Monday night, so that we could enjoy the pool and party in the suite for the day.  I preregistered for the suite Monday around 10am, knowing that it may take a while for the room to actually be ready.  Again, no biggie.  The suite that I wanted (Gorilla Suite) was not available for the night, so I chose the Tree Bark Suite.  I walked around to pool, only to find out that we would not have access to the pool from our patio, as the Breathe Pool was closed, and we would have to walk through the hallway to get to the main pool.  The whole reason I booked the suite was to walk right out of the patio area and have access to the pool - hence POOL VILLA - and when I booked it directly through the Hard Rock reservations, I was told multiple times that we would have an OPEN pool directly outside our patio gate!!  I went to the front desk to express my concerns, and the lady (I'm sorry I didn't get names... ugh) told me that she would have security unlock our patio gate and we would have access to the Breathe pool.  Sweet! I thought.....Right on track.  Until I spoke with the security guy, Pilot, who ended up being the most friendly and helpful person at the Hard Rock.  He told me that the Breathe Pool does not open on the weekdays, and we would not be able to use it, as they did not have a lifeguard on duty.  ((This was not communicated to me in any way shape or form by the front desk staff)).  He apologized profusely on the behalf of the whole hotel and made it a point to try to make me feel better about the situation.  What a guy!  I again, walked to the front desk where I spoke with another young woman.  I began explaining my situation and tried to do what everyone else does when they are unhappy with the hotel.... Get something comped.... in this case.... Maybe a cabana?  WRONG! As soon as I opened up my mouth the woman got stone cold and her eyes glazed over.  I knew there was nothing I could do or say at that point.  Not even hand her some cash.  She was on the dark side.  At that point, we were all pretty much over the idea of a POOL VILLA, so I asked her to cancel the reservation with no penalty, which she did.  I did not once hear an apology from the front desk staff; not even the manager.  
There is a huge communication gap that Hard Rock Hotel should address, and the customer service is hardly up to par.  I appreciate that they did not penalize me for cancelling the day of, but IMO, that should have been expected.
Here is where I wanted to pull my hair out.  My brother in law went to the front desk ten minutes later and explained our story.  He demanded for a comp cabana.....AND GOT IT!  AND also got an apology out of them.  What??? I was glad, but really... How ridiculous!  Couldn't they have saved everyone the headache when I ASKED for it?  I guess you have to act like an A-HOLE to feel like you are a ""guest"" at the Hard Rock.  Sorry, I don't work that way.  I will take my polite and friendly attitude somewhere else next time.  To sum it all up.... We ended up having a great time at the cabana, but I only have my brother in law to thank for that.  I would have given Hard Rock one star for such poor customer service and lack of respect for their guests, but the second star is only because of Pilot (I give HIM five stars).  Hard Rock.....if you hire more people like Pilot, I may consider coming back.  But not anytime soon.  Sorry!",1,1,0

Our check-in was great, no lines and pretty speedy.  Sounds good so far...the room was spacious and clean but had not coffee maker...and here is where the problems begin.  They do not allow outside food or beverages making it extremely inconvenient to get a morning cup of coffee or a late night snack.  To try and save a few bucks we decided to self park our car... while walking down to get something out of our SUV my husband walked up to a broken in car with glass everywhere.  While security and management were ""very sorry"" the only thing they took care of was an incident report.  Our day was spent finding and paying for a new window.

If that wasn't enough...the pool hours are too short, spa services are incredibly spendy, wireless is constantly dropping, casino tables are desolate and empty and the shuttle to the strip (2+ miles away) only runs until 5pm.

Upon entering the room, I was greeted by 90s dark, grunge decor. You didn't get ample light in the room or bathroom unless you opened up the curtains to let sunlight in. The entire time I was there I had to do my makeup by the window, as the light was so dim in the bathroom. I'm wondering if they keep the lights dim so that you won't notice how dirty everything is? I was definitely afraid to walk around the room without my socks or shoes on.

I did like how there was a lot of closet and drawer storage. It was great to actually unpack all of my clothes for my weeklong stay. There wasn't much ambient noise since we weren't directly on the strip, so a room on a high floor wasn't necessary.

The hotel as i guess most people know is about amile away from bustle of the strip. We didnt mind since it was only for 1 night and we like to walk.

After spending the weekend there with a bunch of friends at a bachelor party I wasn't particularly impressed but that's not why I'm writing this.  On Sunday during the rehab pool party I left my room all day and left my wallet in a drawer with $700 in cash in it. When I returned that night it had $200 in cash. 

No one except my roommate (my friend since 10th grade...I'm 30) had been in there. So basically someone on the staff stole my money expecting I was a drunk idiot who wouldn't remember. However, I don't drink at all. So, I did remember. I told hotel security and they did "" an investigation"" which took over 10 days and I only received a response because I called 10 times. The response was ""we didn't see anyone walking out of the room with money in their hands"".  Oh thanks. Glad I waited a week for that. 

I understand that they can't pay people back for every crazy claim but I was asking for $500 while my friends (who have way more money than me) spent $10,000 at the pool that day. So you'd think it's unlikely to spend 10k and make up a story about $500.  

I wanted to talk to a manager and after 10+ calls no one would call me back and I finally stopped trying.

I recently had an epiphany: the ONLY place to stay in Vegas is the Hard Rock.  I don't care what anyone else has to say about it.  All of those other big time casinos are too huge, desensitized, impersonal and just plain suck to stay at.  I like the fact that I recognize certain employees at the Hard Rock- and they recognize and are friendly to me as well.  Those huge mega casinos are fun to visit for a club or restaurant, but staying at them is like getting lost in the mall of america.  Senior citizens and screaming children running up and down the hallways- uh, yea...NO THANK YOU.  Kids shouldn't even be allowed in Vegas in the first place.

The Hard Rock is so fun, young, edgy, hip, beautiful, has great music and the best all-around party scene in Vegas.  The only other casino that can compete is the Palms, but I still think HR is better because its just so much cooler.  It has great restaurants and great entertainment.  AND, its only going to get better with the expansion.  Body English is arguably the best club in Vegas and Rehab is definitely the best summertime party for sure.  The Hard Rock Store carries quality items that I'd actually want to buy outside of Vegas- not the cheap ""Las Vegas"" crap merchandise or Celine Dion memorabilia- I'm talking cute clothes, great designers and nice jewelry.

Not to mention the rooms!  Their beds are so comfortable.  And the rooms are decorated well- not cheesy with crappy generic furniture and floral wallpaper.  They're in the process of expanding the hotel so the construction noise does suck, but you should be too drunk\/hungover to be bothered by that anyways, right?!  And, we must all pay some price for improvement....I just hope that the expansion doesn't take away the great vibe the hard rock has now.

I had a mountain view in the Casino tower. I loved the theme of this hotel!  I loved seeing all of the music memorabilia around the hotel.  This is what pushes my rating to 4 stars.  But there were some definite likes and dislikes:

Likes:
Arrived 4 hours before normal check-in time and was able to get a room since it was available for no extra charge!
Bed is super comfy!!!
Theme is awesome and consistent throughout the hotel.
Small--it is so easy to find everything in the hotel!
Pools are very nice.
Never had to wait long for the elevator at any time of the day. 
For the Rehab fans, they offered half price tickets for hotel guests!
Balcony doors opened up for some nice fresh air!
Majority of the staff were pretty friendly--minus the one d-bag who wouldn't let us walk past the cabanas area to get to the walk-way for the other pool instead making us walk alllllll the way around!

Dislikes:
I was in a smoking room, but didn't have an ashtray.
I asked for a list of restaurants or a map of the hotel but was told it was in my room and they do not have one--guess what, there was none in the room!!
The resort fee--I only used the internet, and even that kept acting up so I just used my own phone wifi.  
The remote for the TV would only work right in front of the TV.
The desk chair in the room was seriously worn out!
Could not get a drink when I was at a slot machine--I was across from a black jack table, and the waitress (who told me she only works the tables) told me another waitress would be by to get me a drink, but an hour later, no one ever showed up!
Lines at the front desk were always long.
There wasn't always someone available at the conceirge desk.
Too many Pauly D wanna-be's running around yelling ""Yeah Buddy!!"" (note--I love Pauly D!)
I was not a fan of the restaurants.  Went to Pink Taco, and it tasted like Pepe's!  Nothing special about the food for what you are paying for.

Luckily, I rented a car (which was super cheap through Pricelines name your own price!).  I was able to save a lot of money on food by going to local spots and eating at fast food places.  I have been to Vegas plenty of times so I liked staying off of the strip for once.  I went to the strip when I needed to (for a show and for a club), but other than that I toured around town at my leisure in a convertible!  Although it's not perfect, I would definitely stay here again!

Money saving tip: If you do rent a car--drive down Flamingo road away from the strip and you will find a grocery store (Food 4 Less) a few miles down where bottles of liquor are SUPER cheap (even cheaper than a liquor store) and you can load your room with cheap drinks and snacks.  Plus you will find many restraurants and fast food places along the way! Also, avoid going to any drugstores (i.e. CVS or Walgreeens) on the strip if you can make it to one off the strip--huge difference in prices!",1,0,0

The HRH draws a younger crowd - average age probably 30 something.

I will tell you why I would have given this five stars.
This place just doesn't stop partying, there is a very young crowd as well, I could tell I was not the only one here to celebrate spring break\/ my 21st birthday. The staff here are always smiling, and always pleasant. They will do just about anything to make your stay more pleasurable. When we first arrived to the hotel, a very drunken lady came up to my boyfriend (ladies do not leave your man alone here) and began to kiss his cheeks and hold him with a ninja grip, though I quickly intervened, the staff quickly called security and took care of the situation, they apologized a lot for that, so I wont take away that 5th star for that because that drunk lady (at 7 at night mind you) was not their fault.

The odds at the tables are great, and this was of course my first time gambling, every one of the people helped us out and taught us how to play, taught us the rule book, and helped us make our betting decisions. I walked away with a couple hundred bucks, and I am not complaining. And all of the bartenders are very nice and recommend their fav drinks if you ask them. When I went to the luxor, they were a little bitchy about suggesting anything. And the drink the luxor guy suggested was GROSS. 

The only down side:

-18 dollars for one cape cod cocktail!!!
-music playing non stop, I think they stop playing it only between the hours of 4am and 10am. Not enough for me thank you. And it seems to be the same playlist?

We asked to talk to a manager but no one came down. We expressed our concerns and told them we wanted our room. This was the worst experience we have had checking into a hotel. We come often to Las Vegas and we have never had this experience before. The suite was nice after we got our keys but the wait was ridiculous. We will not be staying here in the future and I recommend others to look somewhere else.",0,0,0

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES STAY AT THIS DISASTER OF A HOTEL!!!

My friends and I booked here only because other friends that we were to be meeting wanted to stay here. I was irritated because of it's location off of the strip, but I didn't want to rock the boat, so I acquiesced. Turns out I should have put up the biggest fuss of my life. 

When we arrived at our room in the casino tower, the card reader at the door was faulty and did not work for the 1st, 2nd or 3rd key. Finally, the fourth key worked. When I entered the room, I saw disheveled sheets, tissues on the bed like somebody had just had a ""session"" a wet washcloth on the alarm clock CRAWLING WITH ANTS, ANTS ON THE ROOM PHONE  and a HORRENDOUSLY foul order flowed out of the room as well. I called front desk and they moved us to the HRH tower. Definitely nicer but guess what... the SHOWER HAD SLIME ALL OVER THE BOTTOM!!! I wore shower shoes for the rest of the weekend after that. The floor was not vacuumed and so I had room flops as well. Just wholly uncomfortable and dirty. 

Honestly, there are so many annoying things to tell, so I will save you the rest of the bloody story and just tell you about the cons.

CONS:

- Rehab will charge you an additional $3 per drink because of some nonsencical LET tax that they don't tell you about ahead of time

- They gave us a $50 food credit for the inconvenience, then charged my card for it

- Did I mention the DIRT??

- OUT OF THE WAY!! You will spend $80 additional on taxis 

I don't even want to go on. Just save yourself a headache and don't do it!! You've been warned!!",6,0,0

I've been staying and playing at the Hard Rock since it was a small boutique hotel in the 90's. With each expansion and renovation they seem to provide less value and  provide more contempt- Not only for their regular hotel guests but for mid level gamblers such as myself. Im not a high roller but I do buy in for $10k at a time so not exactly $5 hands. I haven't stayed there in a bit because it seems like their rooms are really falling apart. Always something broken and always nasty stains. But I have considered myself ""lucky"" when playing there so I tend to stop by there whenever I'm in town and buy in for between $2-10k. Never again!

Last time I went there I dropped $4k on a marker. Nothing crazy. I've dropped $10k on a marker before and have ZERO history of issues paying back my markers. Their policy has always been 30 days then they deposit them. Typically, they'll send an email before they do so and have always been super cool about giving extra time if needed. 

With this last $4k, they deposit 2 markers for $2k each within 7 days of my visit. No word. No email. Just a deposit. Which isn't really that big of a deal except I set up the marker like 7 years ago and there is an old account attached to them so it required moving money from my main bank account to the old one. 1 marker clears, the other doesn't. I get a call from Robert ""Bob"" Ginter in casino credit department. A man I've spoken to on a NUMBER of occasions in the past. I asked Bob what the deal was. What's up with 7 day deposit?  Bob says their policy has changed and it went from 30 day deposit to 14. Even though they deposited after 7. Still. Not that big of a deal even though it's odd that the usual courtesy call I've gotten in the past was never made even with a significant policy change. I tell him I'm going to have my assistant mail the check. I leave town on business trips on and off for the next 2 months. I come back and Bob reaches out to me about the check for the measly $2k that my assistant forgot to send. She was fired for other but related reasons shortly after. 

I apologize and say ill send a wire. He then proceeds to threaten me that he was going to file charges with the Attorney General after decades of patronage and ZERO issues with markers in the past with Balances MUCH higher than $2k. I'm astonished. I tell him that it's interesting that he would threaten such a long time player with the law over $2k and I would never play in a place again if they pursued such petty matters. Maybe it was unwise to test them on their threat but i decided to see what would happen and how they would handle it if I were to delay payment again. I thought there is no way they would risk losing such a steady player that reliably pays his markers in an expedient manner except for this one time. I should've known better. 

Well, today... I receive a letter from the attorney general for ""writing bad checks"" dated sept 13th with 10 days to take action or be issued a warrant for my arrest. So I receive the 10 day notice dated 9\/13 to pay on the 23rd. Today. The 10th day 

In retrospect, I should've just paid it when Bobbo threatened me. It's clear that the Hard Rock has become the worst place to play and stay in Vegas. Everyone knows they are losing money and they cut corners and treat their guests horribly. I mistakenly assumed that players get more leeway but again, I should've known better. LISTEN TO ME HARD ROCK. EVERYONE I KNOW WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS. I WILL NEVER PLAY ANOTHER DIME IN YOUR CASINO AND WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE NO ONE I KNOW WILL PLAY THERE EITHER.  So it looks like I have to deal with the AG instead of Bob Ginter now. Genius work guys!

PS- I dropped another $6k on the same trip at the Golden Nugget when I was in town for Punk Rock Bowling. I had never stayed at The Nugget before and I actually had to call THEM to ask them to deposit my markers. They asked if I needed more time. I said no. So the Hard Rock has become WORSE THAN A DOWNTOWN VEGAS HOTEL NOW.   I have markers all over town and have a balance of 0 on all of them.",3,0,0

My buddy and I were coming into town a night early before my bachelor party kicked off. We wanted to stay somewhere neither of us had been to before, so we chose the Hard Rock based on that and he had found a sweet deal (expensive week with the CES trade show in town). We didn't realize it was so far off the strip, but we thought no biggie.
Checking in, the front desk was really friendly to us, and gave us a free upgrade. We ended up being in the Paradise Tower, which we thought was the newer part of the hotel (?). Our room was great...no complaints at all. The room seemed newer, and the bathroom was actually nice...overall I liked it. We had a great view, which was directly above Rehab (amazing how large that whole pool area is). Outside noise was virtually non-existent. We didn't really hang in the casino much so I don't have any good or bad info for it. All in all I was impressed with the stay, and would definitely consider going back.",1,1,1

We reserved the room on Travelocity but the problems started as soon as we rolled up at the Valet. I own a limousine business (LA LimoScene if you wanna look me up.) and we drove to Vegas in a Limo with a friend. We tried to valet the Limo and they first told me I needed to go over to the South Valet on Harmon and they could valet the Limo over there so I drove around to the South Valet and they also refused, accusing me of being some guy that tried this last week. I told them I wasn't that guy but they still gave me attitude. I asked them for oversized parking and they told me to park in self park. I drove up to the self park area and there were NO spaces big enough to accomodate the Limo so I had to park in a non-space at the end of the parking structure. I wasn't blocking anyone so I figured it would be okay. When I came out at the end of my stay, I had a parking citation on my car for parking in a non-space. I was pissed since I asked and they sent me to park there.

Then, once we got inside, the girl at the Reservation Desk couldn't find our Reservation. We were in a hurry to check in because we had tickets to a concert so the added time it took for her to figure out where our reservation was didn't help. It took about 20 minutes to check in. Once she found it and we got up to our room, it took them another half hour to get our bags up to our room from the valet.

The room was fairly nice. The bed was really comfortable and the black out curtains would have made it possible for us to sleep in had it not been for the planes flying over and landing every 20 minutes. HRH proximity to the airport is a definite downside. The bathtub was really high so when you get in and out of the bathtub, you trip over the edge and either fall in or out of the bathtub, depending on which direction you're going.

The prices were ridiculous throughout the hotel. It was like renting a room at the airport. $10.50 for a pack of cigarettes.

Checking out was equally poor. We couldn't get the Bel desk to answer the phone so we had to go down to the front desk to request someone to go up and get our bags. When we finally got them, several things were missing including my Gucci Sunglasses and that $10.50 pack of cigarettes.

When we got home and checked our statement, we found that they had charged $400 to our card even though we prepaid for the room and then credited back $166. When we called to find out what happened, they were rude and said the charges were $15 per person for a resort fee and then hung up on us.

All in all, the Hard Rock sucks. I definitely do not recommend them.",3,3,1

We had a huge group of 20 people, and everyone was well catered to and loved the rooms. We had a pool view, and it was amazing. You could look out of your window to the huge pool area.

I never realized how small this hotel and casino was! I guess I'm spoiled with always staying at places like Aria, the Venetian, Encore, etc. Anyways it's still a great hotel to stay in. Not my favorite but still good. 3.5 star rating for me

Pros:
- Stayed at the new tower and new suites which was awesome! You have a separate valet, entrance and front desk than the rest of the hotel.
- Suites are nice and spacious with a completely separate living room and large L shaped sofa which could comfortably sleep 2-3 people if you wanted to. There was only 3 of us in the room so we didn't need to do that. I had my own bed hehe =)
- Convenient location of the new tower. Right downstairs in Johnny Smalls which is an EXCELLENT restaurant as well as the entrance to Vanity Nightclub.
- Tiesto is spinning there once a month for all of 2011!!!! GAHHH! That in itself deserves 10 stars!! 

Cons:
- Off the strip
- Ventilation is horrible! The other hotels do a better job at sucking up most of the smoke. They didn't do so well here. =(
- Smaller place in general
- Bathroom lighting SUCKS! How are we supposed to put our makeup on in this horrible lighting. I didn't know when to stop adding more blush lol",4,3,3

In the past, this place has taken good care of us. We gamble a LOT so we get comp rooms on the strip and at the hard rock. During my trip to las vegas during the World Series of Poker, i had an offer of 5 comp rooms for the hard rock. 

I called and the people on the phone were very nice, so i offered money to upgrade our comp rooms to a suite.. which the person agreed.

Upon arriving, i was disappointed to find our HRH suite was no nicer than the standard rooms that we were comped. The standard rooms even had an open air balcony type thing overlooking the rehab pool party, where the HRH suite had no fridge, no opening windows, etc.

A light was burned out in our room, the ice machine on our floor was broken, and the phone didnt work.. plus no fridge no open window,  so i decided to walk down to the front desk and see if we could switch into our previously offered comp rooms. The suite simply wasn't worth it, and I had nicer comp rooms already at hotels on the strip.

The front desk person said, my rooms were completely comped and that i didnt have to switch rooms, that maintenance would take care of the issues and i could keep my suite free of charge. Great. Later that day i wanted to double check this, so i returned and asked again what i was paying for the room, and they again told me zero charge...... this was all good until checkout... Ill explain that later.

We had a decent time at the hard rock... a waiter in the culinary dropout was pretty bad and im pretty sure he was feeling me out to sell me drugs, but whatever... its vegas. The hostess at the pink taco made my wife and I upset one night because we wanted to get takeout, and she told me it would be over an hour unless i wanted to eat there i could get served immediately... I explained, why can't you just serve me the food and i can put it into a box and walk away... it didn't make sense to her... so we ended up grabbing something quick at Mr Lucky's.

The real problems happened at checkout. They offered me a 25 dollar per day food credit, which they never applied to my bill... but i was SHOCKED when i saw over 400 dollars worth of 'room upgrade and resort fees'. Not only did they charge me the full 'upgrade to suite' charge, but they also charge random fees between 30.01 and 75.01 as 'resort fees'. My checkout amount was over 1300! I was nice and smiling and asked to speak to a manager. They had me walk to the other part of the Casino and i spoke to a woman manager who offered to take 120 off. I told her my story but she didnt want to hear it, she suggested that unless i had a 'casino host' i couldnt be reimbursed for my rooms. She admitted that it was the casino's mistake for telling me that i had comp rooms, because the suite upgrade system was different than the hotel checkin system. Although she admitted fault, she told me there was no way she was dropping anything additional off of the bill, and I would have to dispute it with my credit card.

I felt cheated and scammed by their misleading offers. The money i saved from the rooms, I had already pumped into their slot machines and table games as a 'feel like I owe them one'... now i was charged anyways.",3,0,0

First of all no matter what they tell you, it is FAR from the strip. Way farther than most people would want to walk. Especially in 100 degree weather. So you have to take a shuttle, that stops running at 5 pm, or find some other way to get there. 

Basically, everything about this hotel is geared towards trapping you there, making it difficult to leave, and then charging you as much as possible for as much as possible.

Our room was a little dirty and run down. It looked like it's seen its share of wild parties, i.e. stains on the rug, chips and scratches on the furniture. The maid service was a little sloppy and careless. The room had a desk, but with no chair to sit at it with, so I had to call the front desk and ask them to bring one so I could do things on my laptop. The bathroom had 2 sinks but no bathtub, just a shower stall that leaked all over the bathroom floor.

The pool was a  real pain to deal with! It was a far walk from the room. One of the main things I like to do when I'm on vacation is hang out in the Jacuzzi. Since our room didn't have a bathtub, and I could not take a hot bath which is what I also like to do, I was looking forward to the Jacuzzi by the pool. So I went to the pool and the guy tells me there is only one jacuzzi operating today. I looked at it and it was nasty. There were about 15 trashy looking people hanging all around and it and in it. And honestly, it looked like a scene from a low budget gangster rap video. I wouldn't put my foot in that water if you paid me. I happened to find another jacuzzi that was kind of hidden in a corner, that was actually quite nice and had some cool decent people in it. But if I didn't stumble upon that on my own I would have never known it existed. The staff member didn't even mention it.

I always went to the pool in the late afternoon, and each day they suddenly announced that they are closing the pool early because they didn't have enough staff. So I got gypped out of pool\/jacuzzi time each day!

Forget ever ""chilling"" by the pool. The music by the adult pool was almost as loud as a heavy metal concert, I'm not kidding!

The family pool had loud music too but not as loud. They also had sand in both pools, to make it seem like a beach. I just found that to be annoying because sand got everywhere and in everything just like at a beach, only this sand didn't seem very clean.

They do not allow any outside food or drinks or coolers into the hotel. I am very into healthy\/ organic, high quality food. So when I drive to Vegas I always bring a cooler with some of that food in it so I don't have to eat 3 meals a day of hotel junk. Well, they don't allow that. They don't even have a fridge or microwave, or coffee maker in the room. You are forced to buy their way overpriced garbage instead.

They had some decent restaurants in the hotel, but most of what they had was way pricey. For instance, a breakfast omelette like you'd get at a Denny's was $16. And they do NOT have a buffet.

The worst part  of my trip was that I got food poisoning after eating at the Culinary Dropout restaurant in the Hardrock. I was puking all the next morning and felt a little sick the rest of the trip (and no, I was not drinking at all). My friend also felt a little sick after eating there, but not as bad as me. I think it was either the oysters or the fondue.

Another thing that annoyed me is this, it's called the ""Hard Rock"". But when I first walked into the casino I saw exhibits for Miley Cyrus, Tupac, and Niki Menage. What they have to do with ""Hard Rock"" I'll never know! Not to mention, the whole rock and roll vibe that they did have was mostly of the darker side of rock. I wish they focused more on the fun and exciting side of rock and roll.

Believe it or not, there were some good things about this hotel. They did have a lot of cool displays of rock memorabilia all over the place. And they do have some cool concerts right in the hotel. While I was there they had the Scorpions doing a 5 night residency, which was awesome!! There was also a great 80's metal cover band playing in the club in the hotel right after the Scorpions concert. 

There were also hot and sexy female acrobats swinging from the ceilings stationed all around the casino on the weekend! And it seems they went out of their way to hire lots of good looking cool and sexy staff. So, the eye candy was nice. But still not enough to make me want to stay there again.",6,4,3

As a lover of all things metal and hard rock walking into this place is like entering a musuem of my favorite things. Every wall is covered with rock band memorabilia, cases contain all types of rock star oufits and mementos, guitars hang everywhere, videos are playing, and classic to current rock and metal is blaring over the loudspeakers.

There are usually some lower limits on the table games and it's not too hard to find $5 and $10 blackjack here. GoGo girls dance on stripper poles over the table gaming area adding to the rock aura of the place. Waitresses in skimpy outfits come around to serve up drinks. There is a new tower and gaming area that adds even more slots to make a deposit of your hard earned cash. It's a fun place to play at, but I always found the slots to be tight, while having much better luck on the table games. Sometimes it's better to play some video poker at the circle bar over a few drinks while listening to good tunes.

Restaurants like Mr. Lucky's and the Pink Taco offer up decent to pretty good eats, while the ""Rehab party at the pool"" can best be described as a human petri dish of bodily fluids. Taking in a concert at The Joint is always a cool experience, along with after partying at one of the bars or on the casino floor. The Hard Rock is a place to party down, soak up the scene, and be seen.

One of these visits I will actually stay here overnight for a few days to get the full experience, so for now, three stars.",5,2,4

This is especially true of the poker room, which is in a back room with low ceilings and blue\/black painted walls.  I hated it.  Admittedly, it didn't help that I lost a huge pot with pocket Aces, but that's another story for another time....

The sports book is about the size of a studio apartment in Allston.  No legitimate casino should have something that small.

And the blackjack tables pay out blackjack at a lower rate if you're at a table in front of the dancers (6:5), which caused my friend to storm off in a fit of anger, which was pretty funny until he woke up the next day and realized he still had chips from the casino.  Since we were not staying at this godforsaken place, we had to go back in the morning before his flight and cash in the chips, which was not that much fun, because this hotel\/casino is a 30 minute walk from the Strip.",0,1,0

So close to the strip (15 minutes walking, 5 minute drive) and with affordable pricing, great accommodations and stellar service; I couldn't help but think why more people don't frequent the Hard Rock services.

The front desk\/attending service was incredible, being very helpful and kind enough to draw a map to our room. Walking through the casino portion, everything was very up-to-date and laid out in a manner of ease, including passing two separate bars and several well-known restaurants. 

The room itself was easily accessible and the decoration superb for $40 a night (gotten through a deal of course) furnishing two beds, a full bathroom, dining area, and mini fridge. The environment was very clean and went perfect!

A few colleagues arrived the day before I did and got rooms near the top floors of the Casino Tower. They could barely sleep because of the in-room parties and planes all night long (Hard Rock is right next to the airport.)

Next day I arrive, walk in the doors of the hotel and it's like douche-bag central. Loud, obnoxious, sloppy drunks all around me, bumping into me as I'm trying to make my way to registration. It's barely past breakfast-time.

So I thought I'd be safe with a room on one of the lower levels, but my room was overlooking the roof of the kitchen from one of their restaurants and the smoke from their huge vents would fill my room with smoke.

Next morning, we decided to eat at Mr. Lucky's-- Hard Rock's over-priced diner within the hotel. We sat down about 7:50am, waitress came over to take our order, and we said we were all going to order the breakfast special but were were still waiting for one person. Since the deal ended at 8, we asked if we should order now so we could still get the deal. 

""Oh, no problem"", she said. ""You were seated before 8, so you'll still get the deal.""

8:05 and our colleague arrives. The waitress comes by and we tell her we'd all like the specials. 

""Sorry, that deal ended at 8.""

""That's not what you told us 15 minutes ago.""

""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it"", then something about the computers locking them out at 8. So we paid for our $17 coffees and left to have breakfast somewhere else.

Plan on pool parties Saturdays and Sunday's with awesome DJ's. People walk around in flip flops and relaxed, which is what I love the most!

I do not recall on having to ask for the hotel service for anything so I can't tell you how their service is like. The good thing is that we didn't run into any problems with the room. So, that's always a good thing.

The Hard Rock is located about two LONG blocks OFF the main strip. I found the rooms here cheaper than some of the strip hotels. 

If you want to be in the middle of everything, the hustle and bustle, complete craziness, traffic, too many people then this isn't the place for you. I actually liked that it was LESS crazy that the strip ( especially on the weekends and holidays).

I hear there is a shuttle during the day to the strip. Other than that - there is a self park garage  that picks up UBER\/Lyft customers .. otherwise taxis can be found at front entrance. Just to take me two blocks to Planet Hollywood\/ Cosmo cost us 10 bucks. It is a mission to get between hotels for sure! 

There are three hotel towers at the Hard Rock. I stated at the Paradise tower which was the farthest to walk to from front desk but I was very comfortable. Had a great view of the pool and part of the strip. The beds and pillows are amazing, bathroom was spacious- 2 sinks, great shower head pressure. Rooms are less decorative than other hard rock hotels I've stayed with but I was comfortable none the less.

Pool... I saw 4 pools. 

WARNING- the sand will BURN your feet when it's hot!!!

The nirvana pool is free for guests and was chill and relaxing. The other side has the Rehab pool-usually open 11-6pm. Promptly.  Need to call for times and prices etc cuz it seems to change . Rehab is a party pool NOT for relaxing. You will go thru TSA security - entrance is in the paradise garage BTW- super strict on what you can bring inside or they will have you check your bag for a price. Cabanas and daybeds are Insane prices. Not gonna write too many on here and more on the yelp for rehab. Otherwise music is good and it's a fun time once you settle in.

I love the music memorabilia around the casino ... which the rooms and the floors of the rooms were more decorated like other Hard Rock Hotels I've been to. 

Food.. there is a Pink Taco here which is eh, Nobu- which I didn't try, luckys is a good breakfast\/ 24 hr spot with decent American food. The oyster bar was my favorite food spot here! Really good stuff there( will write in their own review) 

There's a cute store Day and Night with some cute clothes, bags, hats etc for ladies ... also a hard rock store. 

Magic mike live was showing here as well but I didn't go see the show. 

I usually like to try different hotels when I come to vegas but I would come back here again. I was very comfortable

Also, keep in mind that during the summertime on Sundays they have Rehab there, so be prepared for insanely loud music and noise. Besides that, I absolutely love this hotel. A very nice lady upgraded us to a room with a loft area in the casino tower, which was incredible. Very spacious and lovely decor. I've also stayed in the paradise tower before, and that room was nice too with retro band photos on the wall. I prefer the casino tower though, because you have opening doors to fresh air and an amazing view of the strip ahead and the pool below.

I've been to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino for two different conventions in the last two years and I really enjoy the venue.  The location is its only downfall as it is far from the rest of Vegas.  However, what's great is the intimate size of the hotel and its venue space.  

Most recently I attended the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, which was held in The Joint at the Hard Rock.  The layout was much different than previous years, but was something new and exciting.  The show utilized three different rooms and it all worked well, with the Awards finishing the four day event.  The rather small Hotel & Casino made it easy to sneak out and get a bite to eat at Mr. Lucky's or Pink Taco and do a bit of gambling.  The only thing I do not understand is why the hotel is so dark. The press room was especially dark and it was a bit difficult to get some work done.

Nevertheless, the hotel is awesome. It makes for a different kind of Vegas experience.  There's plenty of drinking, gambling, and partying going on, but nowhere near the amount of the Venetian, Cosmopolitan, or the Bellagio.  I didn't attend any of the clubs inside the Hard Rock, but I did try some of their dining options.  Mr. Lucky's is great and you can't go wrong with the 7-7-7 deal, which is a salad, steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes all for $7.77.  Also, Pink Taco is not a bad option for late night eating.  The Mexican food is pretty bland and nowhere near the quality of real taqueria's, but not bad for a Hard Rock interpretation.

Overall, I'd like to actually stay at the Hard Rock for a few days, but not my entire visit in Vegas, as there's much more to do on the strip.  However, I'd love to spend a few days in a more quiet and relaxed atmosphere, which the Hard Rock would be perfect for.  Lastly, I'd love to see what all the hype is surrounding Sunday's Rehab.",1,0,1

Once we walked thru the doors we got slapped with the horrible smell of cheap stripper perfume. After that everything went down hill Fast!!! The following are the Pros (not many) and Cons of our stay:

Pros
1. Music in the hotel was pretty awesome and decor was nice in the hotel (not the rooms I'll get to that with the cons)

2. Bed was very comfortable 

Cons
1. I booked a king size bed and was given a room with two queen size beds. I called the front desk immediately and was greeted with a non concerned front desk employee informing me that we arrived late and no more rooms were avaliable with a king size bed. I asked him why i wasn't  informed of the room when I checked in and he simply answered that it's all up to the employee to inform the guest WTF! Really???? (They should have trollys to take us to our rooms the first room we had was close to the strip!!)

2. We got upgraded to a Suite that night after another employee jumped in and made an effort to help us out. The suite was WORSE!! MY fiance noticed TRASH in the bar area and the remotes had brown stains all over!! The table in the living room looked like it had been put thru one to many alcohol fueled ragers! 

3. The plastic like couch in the room was STICKY!! I don't want to know why! Ugh

4. There were so many call girls congregating by the slot machines trying to blend in and find suiters to charm to take to their rooms.

5. The customer service really really really sucked!

6. When I checked out they asked me why I didn't inform them earlier of the trash and remotes I answered because we didn't notice it until 3am and we were tired. The lady made me feel like it was my fault that happened.

THE GOOD:
The staff was fantastic (with the one exception of the girl who worked in the corner shop-- not the Hard Rock shop, the little one at the corner of the HRH tower where you can buy Monster and M&Ms and stuff). I regret that I never got his name, but the guy working the morning taxi line was extra awesome-- he went out of his way to find the right vehicle at the right price.
There are a sh*t load of displays
The family pool was pretty cool (can't comment on the other pools, but they looked pretty ok)
Rooms were surprisingly quiet. We heard more from the airport than the party downstairs, 
THE EH:
The room was kind of sub-par; like, yay, there's a pic of Pete Wentz taking a leak, but there are also burned out light bulbs.
The TV on the bedroom side of the suite was seriously from like 2003 and only got local channels.
The bathroom was GREAT, but some asshole put the privacy curtain on the outside of the glass door--so you can totally be relaxing into your chin-deep bubble bath when someone whips the curtain aside for any mini-reason. Not cool.
Shuttle-- yeah, pretty much not  a thing...
Taxi to the Strip was minimum 12 bucks (without tip) each way
Resort Fee: Fine if you're hanging out. But if you're doing other things in the area, you're just paying for other drunks to hang out by the pool....

There were a number of pools, surrounded by little sand beaches. It was a different vibe then I've seen at other pools. Even though it was early afternoon on a Thursday, all the lounge chairs were taken, or supposedly reserved for future occupants, by their buddies. 'Oh, I'm saving these for someone.' The pool drinks are EXPENSIVE! A dollar an ounce for a pool drink! Between the two of us with 2 drinks and a tip, we spent 70 dollars!

The casino itself is shaped in a circle with the restaurants surrounding. I was surprised that this hotel, the Hard Rock being so popular, wasn't on the strip.

I had planned on giving HRH a two-star review because after the ridiculous number of problems we had - to be detailed shortly - they did make a good effort to redeem themselves by upgrading our room.  But, my parting experience from this dismal establishment was getting screwed one last time with transportation to the airport.  Soooo, here goes:
We checked into our room, chilled for a bit, then headed to the strip for dinner.  We decided to take an Uber.  We went to the main entrance and were told the Uber pick up was at the other side of the hotel. We went there and waited for our Uber.  Dude went to the main entrance.  Not HRH's fault.  I get it.  But the reason he went to the front is: HRH keeps moving the pick up point.  Throughout our stay, we attempted to be picked up at the designated Uber pick up, the main entrance, and another parking garage (also a ""designated pick up,"" depending on who you ask) - all places where Uber drivers were told they needed to go to pick up passengers.  And, on the last day of our stay, as we were waiting at the Uber pick up point, we were told it had been moved, yet again.  The pick up point now? A driveway where the drivers had no room to turn around.  So, with all our luggage in tow, we walked to get our Uber, and waited patiently for the large number of cars making three-point turns because HRH didn't think it was necessary to provide a proper pick up point for its guests.  Inconvenienced, yet again.
But, our biggest problem: we got locked out of our room.  And, of course, the employee said it was our fault for demagnetizing our keycards.  'Cause, you know, we're dumb.  We tried to explain that it was impossible for four keycards to have been demagnetized when they were not near any source that would do that.  Whatever.  So, we got new cards.  And, yep, they didn't work.  Trip #2 to the front desk.  We were told they'd replace the battery in the lock, because that's what's wrong.  But, that was not it.  Their tech guy said we'd need to move or wait for the locksmith.  So, we couldn't go anywhere for the rest of the night because we'd be locked out again. They scheduled a locksmith to come the next morning.  He showed up 2-1\/2 hours late.  There went our morning and plans to go to the Grand Canyon.

So, while all these various people with walkie talkies were congregated near our door, we asked them to have housekeeping come clean our room because they had never showed. Of course, they said, they'd be happy to see to that.  And, you guessed it, they never showed that night.  So, we had to ask again the evening of our second day, because we still hadn't had anyone come clean our room.

So, on our third trip to the front desk to get new key cards, we asked to talk to a manager, to describe the progressively longer list of BS we were having to deal with.  The assistant manager with whom we talked was sympathetic, and upgraded us to a suite.  Yay, HRH! That, and all the cool rock memorabilia, got them to three stars.

But, then, with every Uber ride we took, our frustration grew, because we had literally no idea where our driver would show up because each one would tell us they were being told to go pick up people at different locations.  And we saw first hand how much grief the drivers got from the HRH staff.  So, down to two stars.  But, with that final pick up issue, I decided I'd had enough, so 1 star is what HRH gets.

After check-In, reality reared its ugly face: 2nd floor room with connecting door to next room, panoramic windows overlooking an ugly and vast parking lot, A\/C seemingly out of control. Quite a bummer, especially after an 18-hr flight.

CHANGES - My girlfriend (now wife) took a chance and tried to convince the front office that this room would be no option for our next five days ... and we were promptly offered to move to a HRH Tower Suite the next day. Plus we got a bottle of champaign delivered to our 2nd floor room, with compliments from Mrs Singer (Front Office Manager). Big kudos go out to Mrs Singer - she literally saved our Vegas Honeymoon!

VIVA LAS VEGAS - Now we're talking! The HRH suite was exactly what we were looking for. Plain awesome! Super comfy bed, huge bathroom, lots of space and stunning views on both the Strip skyline and the Nirvana pool AND our very own jukebox. 5 stars for this one.

INSIDE THE ELECTRIC CIRCUS -  For me, being a rock fan since elementary school, the HRH is a dream coming true. Each and every wall is jam-packed with guitars, band outfits, drumkits and other memorabilia, the dark and tasteful interior oozes the spirit of rock'n'roll without being too clownish - just great. 5 stars.

EAT 'EM AND SMILE - We ate and smiled (and drank) quite a lot: Breakfast and the occasional burger at Mr Lucky's (nothing to write home about, but worth the dollar), some bites and booze at Culinary Dropout (see above), margaritas at Pink Taco (man, they did their job!) and a big dinner at 35 Steaks + Martinis (awesome steak, yummy salads but WAY too overpriced).

WHAT'S NEXT TO THE MOON - For a truly special Italian dinner experience, try Ferraro's Restaurant just across Paradise Road (which we did). For cheap margaritas, try the Paradise Cantina nearby during Happy Hour (which we did A LOT). For the ultimate KISS paraphernalia overkill, try the KISS Minigolf & Museum just across East Harmon (which we did every day ... after we partied all nite).

ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION - Be prepared to hear rock music everywhere, anytime. In the casino, in the elevators, on every floor, in every restroom. If you're not into rock (and\/or roll), this might not be your hotel. But then again, this is kind of imminent, I guess.

We paid for a corner suite, but ended up with a crap view because we needed a non-smoking room. There were buildings on both sides, but we could see the Hard Rock Cafe guitar between them which is pretty cool, but not the view we were expecting. 

The room was really nice, and the bed was super comfortable. We had a KISS themed room, which I loved. The room was always clean, and it was super quiet. I was expecting some noise after reading the other reviews, but it was really nice and peaceful, and we saw people in the halls often so we know the rooms by us were actually occupied.

I liked how everywhere we walked within the hotel had good music playing, and it was a lot of fun looking at the different memorabilia, a lot of it had changed since the last time I was there.

We ordered room service twice, and ate at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast once. Overall everything was good, the french onion soup from room service was delicious, so were the mini sliders. I was actually really surprised at how tasty the mini sliders were, I wasn't expecting that much but they were really good. The potato skins had a bunch of bacon and were really crispy. The breakfast at Mr. Lucky's was better than the room service breakfast. Really, the only difference was the eggs. Mr Lucky's cooked them right, but the room service eggs were way over cooked. Besides that everything was good, pancakes, fruit, coffee, etc.

We would go back, we had a good time, liked the room, and besides the view we didn't have any issues. I absolutely loved the body lotion, it had a light citrusy scent, and was gentle enough to use on my face.",1,0,0

It's advertised as 4 star east of the strip area hotel. And the reviews were overall pretty good. I book for a Wednesday - Friday stay before Memorial Day weekend and got a room for about $31\/night, plus taxes and resort fee ($28\/night) the whole stay ended up being about $132. 

Check-in was quick, however even though we had 3 people, Hotwire booked us a room with only a King size bed. Unless you want to get really comfy with your travel partners, I'd suggest booking with 4 guests if you want 2 beds. The staff was nice enough to give us two queens anyways and gave us flexibility on what floor and what view we wanted. However, in our eagerness to get these ""upgrades"" we unfortunately got a smoking room on the 8th floor. And man....never again. The room smelled and felt dirty. So we switched to a non-smoking room on the 4th floor, w\/o a great view but I was happy with the room. 

*Beds are sooooo comfy! Seriously, you could totally sink into the bed and hide there. 
*French doors in each room that open out. You can definitely keep them open for some fresh air, but beware of moths! 
*Water pressure in the shower was amazing! I felt like I could take a quicker shower.
*Shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap smelled great and we got a generous amount
*Overall the room was pretty clean! 

The only minor thing was that I wished there were more towels and toilet paper. 

I was a little hesitant at first about getting a hotel off the strip, but in the end I'm glad I did. The Hard Rock is situated at a really convenient place so that you wouldn't have to battle the traffic on the strip to get back to your hotel room. You definitely need a car to get to the strip, as the free shuttle only runs from 10am - 5pm. But what I did like about the Hardrock was that there was already a few restaurants on-site, a pool, a club and a relatively good sized casino. So if you wanted to, you would never have to leave. Which is good for some. Also, they give you free food and beverage credit when you check-in, so all in all, not a bad deal! I'd come back.",7,1,2

My partner and I had a king suite in the HRH Tower and it was just right - nice bed (too soft for us, but I think most people prefer that in their vacay mattress), nice sitting area with plenty of room for lounging, nice big bathroom with BIG soaking tub (and, yes, I did... it was lovely), plenty of space in closets and drawers, and a touchscreen-operated sound system with a bunch of songs preloaded, mostly big hit rock songs (my iphone wouldn't work with the system, sadly).

I spent very little time or money in the actual casino, so I can't really speak to that part of the experience. I only had one meal at the casino, at the 24-hour diner. It was a good breakfast for Vegas-reasonable prices, and our server was on it (pink mohawk guy).

The $22+tax\/day resort fee includes wifi, valet, and some stuff I didn't use like the fitness center and, get this, notary service. We used the hotel as a jumping off point for exploring the area: the nearby White Rock Loop hike (highly recommended), the Neon Museum (I learned something!), Red Rocks Climbing Center (fine, but I'm spoiled here in Seattle), and Joshua Tree (O. M. to the G., YES.).

This one is not on the Strip, for better and worse. Short walking distance spots like Hofbrauhaus, KISS mini golf (worth it!), StirKrazy Mongolian Grill, and CVS are some advantages for being a little ""farther out,"" but there are some down-and-out folks to share the space with. There are a cluster of bars, some straight and some gay, about 10 minutes walk away. The ones we went into (Double Down and FreeZone) were just okay.

The place isn't without it's cons, but the pros just far outweigh. When I start to get the itch to Vegas again in a couple years, I'll definitely look at returning to Hard Rock.",1,0,0

For new years 2012\/13 we enjoyed our stay in a HRH Tower King Suite with the lovely ""Tea for Two"" Tub. Since our plans for this trip included Journey at the Hard Rock and Ka at MGM Grand we went back to the HRH Tower King Suite. 

I'm 6'8"" so a big tub is a big plus in my book, in fact, it's exactly why we got this room again. Imagine my surprise when we checked in to the room and found a lousy 'standard' tub. Odd, since their web site explicitly states: Each 701 square foot king room includes .. with cast iron ""Tea for Two"" tub' .. nope. After spending far too long on hold we were promised the *right* room for our 2nd night. It was busy, I get it, you take what you can get. We followed up in person with the HRH Tower guest services people that we're not looking for an upgrade, just the 'tea for two' tub that was advertised. 

The next day we picked up the keys for our new room in the Casino Tower. A lovely room, although a bit loud since it's 'pool view' .. with a *terrible* 'shower \/ bathtub combo' deal.  Seriously ? Did you not *just* promise us the room we booked with the bath tub we *explicitly* asked for ?

After more time on hold and dealing with a front desk manager who didn't know the difference between a standard King Suite and an ADA Accessible King Suite we finally got the keys to another room in the HRH Tower, with the advertised 'Tea for Two' tub. We probably wasted over an hour in the process but that's how you want to spend your precious weekend off, right ? 

Pro-Tip and Pet Peeve: you have *two* nice 40"" Sony Bravia LCD TVs. Why can't you correctly set brightness\/contrast and get HD content on them ?  

Their 'commitment to excellence' was lacking in other areas as well I'm afraid. Exposed electronics in the mini-bar, poor service in the taxi line (there are two taxis waiting around the corner, could you maybe call them over?) and generally unacceptable wait times for simple room service orders. Coffee and some eggs shouldn't take over an hour. 

Rather than risk going through the same ordeal once more I think we'll just go with the MGM Grand Spa suite next time.",1,2,0

I've partied in the casino circle bar before and had a blast but.... Overall, hotel looks cool, new, fun and plush in pics and I loved that it was off the strip (closer to LVCC for me) but.....I didn't like it. As my friends all know now the hotel stressed me out LOL. Too much black and white, no soothing colors. I was here for 6 days for work (2 for fun) and short of the food (was amazing!) nothing about this place relaxed me or said ""home"" to me while I'm staying there. Nothing against the place but its all old and smokey now. People are loud in the hallways most nights. The party should stay on the casino floor no??? 

The beds were hard, the pillows too soft. It took 4 to feel anything lol. I have to quote my friend when she said that the hotel is called Hard Rock because the beds are hard as rocks hahaha. I did LOVE the tub though. I stayed in the Paradise tower (by starbucks) and the tubs were like jacuzzi's! A big perk for me after being on my feet all day at a show. I felt save in the rooms because the doors are so heavy I didn't feel anybody being able to push the doors down to get in haha. Feels kinda like being in a bank vault (my friends quote again :) ). 

I also liked that the overall hotel was small so it was fast and easy to get to\/from garage to my car daily. No time wasted on valet this time :) My bf also loves the gambling on the floor. He loved the tables (although the tables did not love him lol) and the machines. Drinks were expensive $10 at the bar or wait for waitress, while gambling on the tables and tip $5 each time or more if you want to see her often. I'm used to penny slots with frequent waitress visits with couple dollar tips! Economy hard for them too right??? 

I'd recommend staying here only if you are in fraternity\/sorority here on spring break, if you are having a singles\/bachelorette\/bachelor weekend, on a kinky weekend away trying to save your relationship or if you are cougar\/sugar daddy hunting lol.

We upgraded to a 2 bed room with an amazing pool\/strip view on the 18th floor for only an additional $20 a night. 

Unfortunately I did not get to experience the awesome pools they have, such as rehab, but everytime we were walking towards the lobby we would pass it and it looked and sounded poppin!

The casino isn't as big as many other casinos in other hotels but was entertaining. 

The room service was on point, they came to check if we needed anything every morning at 9am and I really appreciated that as to the fact that I love getting and using fresh, clean towels. The last hotel I stayed at when I was in vegas did not send room service at all until the absolute last day that I was there which was pretty irritating so I truly do appreciate the Hard Rock staff being consistent.

The beds are sooooo comfortable we almost didn't get up once we had laid down!
The only irritating thing I found about the rooms were how dark they were. Everything in the bathroom was black so it was kind of hard to shave my legs even with the lighting, which we kept on while we were out and while we slept all night because it takes a while for the lights to turn onto their brightest form which wasn't very bright either.

For an awesome hotel and great customer service, I am so surprised that I was not charged more than $500 for my stay here.

There are some perks that included it was in a central location, minutes from the strip. They host Rehab, which is a concert. When I came Drake and Lil Wayne was there but guests still have to wait in line to get their complimentary tickets that are for only 2 guests. And make sure you get in line early because prices double, they will stop selling tickets, and the line will be close to 2 hours and up to get a ticket.

My trip happened to overlap with this time but I was fortunate enough to be away from all the traumatic events.

Our stay at the hard rock was an overall good experience. 

The good:
-Room pricing: we got a 2-bed room for about $170
The casino and bars: immediately when you walk in its a party! tons to do, people laughing gambling, loving it.
-Proximity: this hotel is about 7-10 minutes from the main strip. you can take the actual scenic route on the strip or you can take the highway. For extremely unfortunate reasons im glad we weren't in a hotel on the strip this time
-Rehab: the pool of the Hard Rock is seriously bomb. We went to the last one of the year but Ill expand on that in another review. 
-Bell hop: Checkout was at 4 but the bellhop held our things until 10PM and even let us get our stuff to change and what not before we took it completely! that was seriously nice as I had to go to work from the airport. 
-Blackout curtains: if youre a hotel in Vegas and dont have these dont bother being a hotel.

The not-so-good:
-Resort fee: This is kind of a rip off. They should really just include this in the price of the hotel. Its basically a $30 one time fee you have to pay for using the ""free"" wifi and 24 hour gym. Most hotels have this included in the price of the room and you dont see another charge later on.
-Issue at check-in: When i first checked it everything was fine for the most part but then i get up to my room and the girl had written 775 instead of 755 which definitely caused some confusion. TIP: dont go back down, be lazy like me and call the hotel and have them verify for you :)
-Room keys: after a long night at Hakkasan and Sapphire, its 5 am and I would like to go to sleep. but ALAS the key didnt work, this I knew wasnt an issue I could call about because they'd have to re-scan my key. I told them my key didnt work and the gentleman at check in said, and I quote ""yeah our keys are ultra sensitive to cellphones and magnets"" LIKE OK.. Lemme just keep my room key in a separate clutch than my cell phone because yall are stuck in 2003...

They definitely need to import some white sand to help combat the issue, or provide some sort of water service at the poolside beds.  Currently, the staff dumps a couple scoops of ice on the ground, and it cools the sand for about 3 minutes.  It's a pretty piss-poor system.  The crowd was pretty grimy as well.  Maybe up the cover charge?  My sunglasses were stolen, as were my flipflops.  Who steals someone's used $10 flipflops?

I expected the food options and entertainment to be more on point.  This is one of the few casino's in Las Vegas that does not have a nightclub (well, they have one, but it's closed), which was a pretty big damper on our experience.  The food options are pretty basic and boring.  Not at all what I was expecting from Vegas.  Lucky's, the primary eatery at the Hard Rock, is flat out awful.  I got eggs benedict for breakfast Saturday and it was horrible.  The worst $25 eggs benedict I've ever had... It was actually the worst eggs benedict I've ever had.  The eggs were over done, yolks cooked through, and the hollandaise sauce was lumpy and weird.  Yesterday I tried the prime rib, it was worse than the eggs benedict.  I rarely send plates back, but their prime rib was inedible.  It was dry and tough, they even screwed up the mashed potatoes.... How do you screw up mashed potatoes!?!?!?!?

The room was nice, and well kept, but there is literally no hot water.  It's Las Vegas and 101 degrees outside.  Getting water past luke warm shouldn't be an issue.  On top of that, the A\/C is awful.  We've had our room set at 60 degrees since we got here, I don't think the temp has been below 74ish the whole time.  The wifi and maid service were both awful as well.  Their internet was incredibly slow, and the cleaning lady just made the beds.

Given it's poor proximity to the main strip, it's lack of amenities, and lack of quality, I'd prefer to stay somewhere other than the Hard Rock on my next trip to Vegas.",4,0,0

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because the only downside was it wasn't on the stripe which sucked. We have to take a lot of uber rides which was costly. You can definitely walk but when its 95 out and you're wearing a dress and heels it's not ideal! So, location was the only downside but wouldn't stop me from staying here again. Actually, to think of it there was another problem that kind of sucked but i quickly got over. The first day we got there our flight was really early so we didn't expect to get in our room right away so they were really nice about holding our luggage and saying they would call once it was ready. We went out for a few hours and didn't hear anything. So, we called and they were like ya its ready, like why didn't you call us!! haha it was just annoying because we wanted to change and stuff but whatever. The hotel itself was really large and great. They have a few restaurant including pink taco which was AMAZING! The room and bathroom were large and nice and beds were surprising comfy! The best think in my opinion was the pools!! The rehab beach club was great and free which was a plus and they had like 5 other pools open which were relaxing and fun!",0,0,0

I have been to the Hard Rock many times over the years for a show, or for some later night gambling and drinking, but have never stayed there until now.

I was there on business - CES in fact - and this was where we were put because there wasn't much choice during such a busy event. It started with the checkin staff being clueless. They gave my work colleague and I a suite, called it a 'complimentary upgrade' even though we were charge over $600 for the night. Turns out the suite was a single bed, so we had to get a rollaway. The next day, we had to pack up our stuff and move to a 'normal' room - at least it had 2 beds. The decor is very dated and pretty beat up. The shower barely trickled out water, and the drain couldn't have handled any more anyway. 

The toughest part was the jets that flew 10 feet over the hotel from 6AM until 11PM (or later). The windows are so crappy that it did nothing to block the noise. And the party goes nonstop all weekend, all hours, in every room around you which is all right if you are there for a bachelor party but we had to work each day.

When we went to check out, we learned that there was a $28\/day 'resort fee', despite the fact that the pool area was closed the whole time we were there and that the 'spa' was an additional charge as well. When I complained, the clueless woman at the counter said 'well you did use the internet' - and I did, but the service was worse than dialup and dropped constantly.

I found a great deal on a travel website at Hard Rock and booked the rooms. The rates were soooo reasonable that it came to just over 100 bucks for BOTH nights for each person.

I arrived at the Hard Rock first and when I checked in they informed me that my reservation was actually for the HRH Towers!! and then directed me to the private reception & concierge area for this new wing of the hotel that is gorgeous!! I was so pleasantly surprised! its beautiful and all the rooms are incredible, luxurious spacious suites! SWEET! there is a private new spa, and access to the Sky Bar it was absolutely fabulous!! and felt like a remote luxe resort more than anything else...

Without even realizing it, my reservations plus the affordable rates were actually for this brand new beautiful section of the hotel!!

From the moment we pulled up in front of the hotel until we drove away everyone was wonderful.  My friend uses a scooter to get around.  The bell staff was unfailingly friendly and willing to help pull that thing out of the car or put it back in.  Security saw her making her way slowly into the hotel (before picking up the scooter) and they immediately grabbed a wheelchair for her.  The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, no exaggeration!  We stayed in the HRH tower and it was clean and quiet.  We had an accessible room and the walk in shower with a seat was nice for her.  Both times we ate at Mr. Lucky's restaurant the food was delicious and the server very friendly.  The prime rib was delicious.  At 60+ we may have been older than a lot of the other guests, but it was fun to ""people watch.""  The rock and roll memorabilia was interesting.  The free parking is a big plus.  We always used valet parking due to the scooter, but the tip involved was a small price to pay.  I liked being away from the craziness of the strip.  I think our room was much quieter because of it.  I will definitely return.  Thanks, Hard Rock!",0,0,0

That being said, you can't help something out of your control but you can make certain adjustments to make the stay more comfortable for your guests. 

First our reservation was incorrect. They had us arriving on Monday instead of Tuesday. Since we were technically late according to their system, our reservation was completely cancelled, leaving us without a room. After speaking with a bell hop, this is completely STANDARD procedure by all hotels in Las Vegas, so if you're flight is delayed, cancelled or it's raining frogs, by all means contact your hotel so they don't cancel your reservation and you are met with frustration and having to wait to change, check in, drop off bags etc.
After telling us we could still have a room, we were given keys and proceeded to our tower (there are three). However it turns out we were booked into a room into a tower my business partner did not prefer so we asked to change our room request. At that point we discovered there were no rooms available so if we wanted to stay in that tower we would have to leave our bags at the bell desk and check in later when we were notified via text that our room was ready.

Upon coming back to the hotel 5-6 hours later, we were told that the entire system was down so whether or not our room was ready they wouldn't know. They gave us two vouchers for a free drink, ($8 value because that's how much it costs for a domestic beer) and two vouchers for the day spa which we never had a chance to use since our trip was short. After spending about an hour in the central bar, it was nearing the time we were to meet with an associate for dinner. Our room was still not ready according to the lack of text messages indicating so, so I suggested we just check anyways because if the system is down, I doubt any text notifications are going out either. Turns out our room was finally ready, but NOT in the tower we requested. At this point it didn't matter where we stayed as long as I could put our bags in our room and not worry about them. 

Observations regarding our room are as follows;

Not sure when the comforter or fixtures in the room were last dusted\/laundered as there was quite a bit of airborne particles circulating that did us no favors considering we were already suffering from the ""Vegas Allergy"" everyone tends to suffer from when visiting. 

There didn't appear to be any cups or glasses for water. The only option to hydrate within the room was to purchase one of the two bottles of water on the credenza, price is yet forthcoming.

Walls were pretty thin as we could smell our neighbor's morning cigarette distinctly.

The music in the hotel was loud, and pervasive. I suppose with a theme like The Hard Rock it would be silly not to play rock music, but at times it simply added anxiety rather than a relaxing experience.

The lobby reeked of vanilla which I learned from other reviews here is to counteract the smell of cigarette smoke. I'd honestly smell smoke than have a sweet scent layered on top. In addition to jet lag, lack of sleep and a change in elevation, the scent was very disorientating.

What DID I like? The bell hops and valets were very friendly, quick and efficient. The offering of internal restaurants to eat was vast. The room was spacious. It was just OK.",4,1,1

I'm a 51 year old guy with diabetes.   On an anniversary trip with my wife to see the Scorpions.  

First the good.  The concert was amazing.  The venue is the best I've seen with a high tech stage.  Great view screens and effects.  Five star. 

More good the staff here is friendly and kind.  Even security.  Five star.  

The qualities you expect with music and memorabilia are top notch.  The property is in good condition.  I won't go into this do read other reviews for this.  

Now the horror.  There are nannies who do bag checks at the pool.  They search your bag.  No outside booze.  One drink costs 13 dollars.  Seven for a beer.  The pools are not connected.  This is important to me.  They don't want you at the pool.  They want you in the Casino.  The walk to the open pool from our room was fifteen minutes after we went to the wrong pool.  The walk to the pool routed through the middle of the Casino.  In our bathing suits.  One star. 

Which brings me to my next point.  This really isn't a resort.  It's a Casino with hotel rooms, music venue, clubs, coffee shops, spa etc.  Imagine an airport hub with spokes for the concourses.  Your room is in concourse B and there's no shuttle to concourse C.  Bad signage probably on purpose.  You are here to have your pocket picked.  I do not gamble so this is a one star for me.  

Nice place to visit.  Visit and leave will be my assessment for you.  Stay elsewhere.  

Self park is free.  Be prepared to walk.  Music at pool is great.  Drink quality is good.  View from casino tower of the pool and strip is great.  Location is fine.  Pool closes early.  There's a sickly sweet vanilla odor eater smell everywhere like cheap perfume.  CVS across street for booze.  No room coffee or fridge.  The vibe is good.  You will make your good time at this resort.  Best on booze.  Solid three rating.",0,1,0

Referring to hard rock in general) ... And I finally got to in the HRH tower last weekend when we were in Vegas for a wedding.

Miraculously my husband found a SMOKIN' deal on a King Tower Suite with a king bed on Thursday night, and when we arrived (after a VERY long day; broke down 20 miles outside of Baker... AKA 1 hr outside of Vegas), the concierge heard my husband and I talking about our debacle and upgraded us free of charge to a corner suite of the same specs. Check the pics for some documentation of this beauty.

Well, as were talking about the debacle we were dealing with, we started throwing around extending our stay an extra night because we had to wait for my car be fixed. Concierge eaves dropping offers us a second night in the same suite at a discounted rate (not as great as the deal we got for night #1, but offering any discount without the hassle of moving hotels was greatly appreciated). Great! Lock that second night up! 

Now, I'm the queen of ""who cares?! We're only using the room to sleep in""... But I mean, I didn't want to leave this room! It was so G! The bed was like sleeping on a freaking cloud. The room had wrap around windows (get the corner suites), the bathtub was so deep you could swim laps in it, and it was bigger than my first apartment. 

So the concierge is amazing in the customer service department, the rooms are PIMP, and a major nod to Hard Rock Casino because they just have the most laid back, chill, down to earth staff and crowd there. It's my favorite place to be in Vegas. 

And it's directly across the street from Hofbräuhaus... DAS BOOT!",0,0,3

The woman at the desk immediately began helping the guy, without acknowledging us in any way. No ""actually sir these people are ahead of you"" or ""the line begins over there, etc. After another 5 minutes we finally had to step in and ask if we could be helped, seeing as we had just, you know, waited patiently in line. The guy walked off and the woman at the desk grudgingly began ""helping"" us, which roughly translated into barely looking at us and seeming totally indifferent to our presence. No ""sorry about the wait or for just letting some dude step in front you"" or anything nice like that. 

The desk lady checked us in, in the slowest, least interested way possible, occasionally making eye contact, which was awfully kind of her. On the plus side, she didn't just start randomly helping someone else while she was checking us in, which saved some time. And she didn't rigorously try to upswell us to a bigger room, as I heard the guy next to us doing to the couple he was helping. 

As I write this, there are currently 8 people in line waiting to check in, with 2 people on duty to do the checking in. That kinda tells me how much this joint cares about their customers. They'd like us to wait 40 minutes to be helped by someone who seems annoyed to see us and that's if we can make it to her without her helping someone else before we can walk the 3 feet to the desk. 

We haven't even been able to get into a room yet, so I have no idea how this place is, accommodations wise. But the check in was so unpleasant that it inspired me to write this review, to warn others to be prepared for frustration upon arriving. The many many other negative reviews tell me that we can likely expect more of the same from the rest of the hotel, but at the moment I can confirm that checking in here is an arduous and highly unsatisfying experience. When you show up someplace and they seem unhappy and annoyed to see you- it's rarely a sign of good things to come.",7,1,1

My friend booked the Hard Rock for Halloween weekend.  4 nights for a bit less than $500 for the weekend was a great!

OUR ROOM: Standard Double Queen bed Room in the Paradise Tower
*Beds & pillows were comfy, although I wish the pillows were a bit less fluffy
*iPod dock & mounted LCD tv
*Plenty of closet & drawer space
*Safe to store your valuables
*Room lighting SUCKS.  It's basically dark all the time.  Ladies, the only place you'll be able to do your makeup is in the bathroom
*My complaint is the poorly thought out shower.  The shower is not elevated nor is there a raised part to keep the water from not splattering out into the bathroom.  Oddly, there is also a bench in the shower which you can fold up.  Being that we left the bench down to keep our shower toiletries on, it took up a lot of room.

LOCATION:
Even though you're off strip, cab rides are pretty cheap.  It was less than $10 to get to the Cosmopolitan and about $13 to get to Encore

NOTE:
*$20.16\/day mandatory resort fee
*Fitness room is available for use
*Rooms are a good walking distance from the lobby\/casino area
*If you request items to be delivered (i.e. towels, toilet paper, etc.), they will not knock on your door if you have your ""Do not disturb"" sign on....dumb, I know
*Be careful of the minibar on the counter and the fridge items, they're sensor activated
*There is a 24 hour diner - Mr. Lucky's (important to get your drunk eats on)
*There is a jewelry store which I think may be 24 hour.  If we knew that it was open, we would've suggested that the guys who proposed to us on night 1 at Tryst, make it an official proposal

POOL:
Hard Rock is the home of the infamous summer pool party, Rehab.  Pool parties typically end by the end of September, but the pool was still open Halloween weekend.  My friend and I decided to visit the pool on Friday...what did we learn?  The pool water feels like ice water!!!  There was a slide that we were determined to go down, but after thinking about being dunked and having to walk back to our room freezing, we decided that probably wasn't the smartest way to go.  We were way too hungover on Saturday and Sunday to visit the pool like we intended to, but I did walk by on my way to pick up some food.  To my surprise, the pool was cracking!

Saturday late morning we decided to go relax by the pool. As we arrived we set our towels on the chaise lounges and my wife asked the waitress (Ashley) if we can get a cup of ice water. She informed us that we can only get bottled water by the pool. I said are they free cause we just want some water then we will be ordering lunch and drinks by the pool and i didn't want to pay for water when i can go to one of the restaurants by the pol and get a cup of ice water. She said no they are not free but if you're going to be upset i will see what i can do. My wife said i'm not upset just don't see a reason we can get a cup of ice water. She came back with a cup of ice water for us!. We then ordered lunch and a couple of beers. i ordered a Quesadilla and my wife ordered a cheese burger. 

The food came and my wife's burger had a toothpick all the way through it so she removed it and took the top bun off to put mustard and ketchup on it and much to our surprise on the inside of the bun was as clear as day a SWASTIKA drawn out with some sauce. WE WERE SPEECHLESS as well as the couple sitting next to us whom we didn't even know. 

The pool side manager was useless as all he wanted to do was take the burger back to his kitchen staff and discuss it with them. He asked me if i still wanted to eat the burger or if he would like them to make me another one. I was floored that he would ask me a an ignorant question. he then told me he would comp us lunch at Pink Taco which in by the pool. He then took the plate and disappeared. I asked for the Executive chef of the hotel and he arrived and i showed him the photo, he was as speechless as i was.  He took care of our lunch. 

After speaking to some family members we were told to file a Hate Crime police report, so we did with Metro LVPD and their head of security which at that time the head of security informed us that after the Exec. chef interviewed the kitchen staff preparing the food for the pool the culprit admitted to doing it and was immediately suspended (so i was told) 

We were then upgraded to a very nice suite (doesn't justify what happened) which was expected. 

That is the last we ever heard from any staff member on the incident. No apologies or nothing from any higher staff member. NOTHING!

Upon getting home i emailed the CEO of HRH and was contacted by Jody Lake, the COO. Who informed me he will be speaking to his management staff regarding the incident and he will get back to me with a resolution. i was contacted a week later being offered a nice weekend for my wife and I to come back and they would make sure we had a great experience and they will show us a nice weekend. Are almost bursted out laughing saying do you really think i want to come back to your hotel where and employee served me a burger with a swastika? I kindly declined and that was that. Why would i want to go back to a hotel where I asked if i had to pay for a bottle of water and then i'm presented a burger with a swastika on it. All that says to me is here you go you cheap jew who didn't want to pay for water. 

I am appalled at the way the hotel handled this situation. I will NEVER step foot in this hotel EVER AGAIN. To me there is no way that this guy who prepared my burger was the only one who knew. There must have been other kitchen staff who knew and they are still there.",40,10,2

So if you're the type who is bothered by this conduct, you may not want to read my review, or at the very least, take it seriously.  I'd also suggest you book a room at Circus Circus next time you're in town.

1. Rehab.  The reason we stay here.  Fabulous pool party- good looking (generally) young crowd and few or no children.  I've seen things going on in that pool that would make Ron Jeremy blush and I'm sure there is more urine in the water on Sundays than in all the urinals in India. (So if that sort of thing bothers you, I'd avoid getting wet)  Also- unless you are a stripper or in ridiculously good shape- this place will bring out body issues that you didn't even know you had. I recommend drinking through them. Oh, and always, but especially on holiday weekends, make sure you're not cramming extras (aka your cheap friends) into sleeping bags on the floor of your room because they only give you 4 wristbands per, and nobody wants to wait in the entry line.  Trust me.

2. The rooms.  A decent enough size for the 4 of us girls.  Their beds are comfy enough to cradle my weak and broken self after an evening\/early morning of way too many Patron shots and (only once) half a Xanax that I naively felt that I required at 5:30AM. (Extra points for the Rehab bathroom attendant for saying nothing the next day about my repeated visits to puke.) 

3. Circle Bar, Mr. Lucky's, Pink Taco. Ah, what can I say? I've been picked up by a large man in lederhosen (the camera never lies), sold one of my girlfriends to a bartender for $5, and had many an 8AM cervesa in these fine establishments.  All worth checking out- have the carne asada tacos at Pink Taco.  

4. The Casino Floor.  Not a gambler, so I can't really comment much here, but I will give points to the dealer that let my friend a. ash in her own drink, b. ash in my drink, c. spill her drink on the table, before asking us to leave. Got to love Vegas.

5. Convenience.  Yes, it's off the strip- but if you play it right, you may never want to leave the hotel.  

Let's be real folks, this is no place for kids. Let them grow up a bit so they can make their own bad decisions.",2,6,2

Got to hang out with them during the day before going to my humble accomodations off the Strip.  The hotel and casino itself was generally small, compared to the other Las Vegas hotels along the strip.  The ambiance smelled of night club and casino. I guess that was pretty good.

Had lunch at the Pink Taco. Had dinner at Nobu. Pretty upscale Japanese, if you asked me, but it was pretty nice. The HRH rooms were pretty damn luxurious. I'm more used to the Best Westerns and the Motel 6's for my travels, but wow. Damn.

We hung out at the RX Pool for 3 hours, where it was pretty much Spring Break out there, with the loud music and teens all over the place.  I felt out of place, but I tried to be ok with it. The temps were in the musty 102 that day.",1,2,1

The decor is so cool. We love music. However the smell in the hotel was a huge turn off. I felt sick to my stomach. The little mom and pop restaurant is really good. Huge portions. But the room was drab. It was dingy. Made it seem dirty. There was wet spots all down the hallway given the feeling that there was puke. I got on the elevator to get a coffee in the cafe downstairs and a couple who were of a difference nationality we're practically screwing while I was trapped inside the elevator with them.

The downfall to this hotel is the cleanliness, kept up furniture, loud neighbors ( I mean do I have to listen to you have sex all night? Haha), and the hallways smell like cigarettes. 

I hear that staying in the HRH Towers is better! So I guess I won't rule this hotel out yet. But whatever you do, do not stay in the casino tower. 

The pool scene was fun. Beginning of the season so not crowded at all which was nice. The drinks are definitely over priced at the pool so I recommend not ordering them. I mean do you really expect me to pay $30 for a double? That $30 better be for double grey goose bottles. :) the downfall to the pool area is there so many restrictions of what you can take inside. I mean I had to go back to my room twice to empty my purse or just not take it. Seriously Hard Rock?!! Ridiculous!  

My experience at this hotel is so so... From the time I got out of the car and being sexually harassed by all the security guards to laying pool side... I guess I can give a more final review staying in a different tower.

I saw a Groupon for this hotel and thought it would be a good idea for his birthday weekend.  The last time we've stayed at a Hard Rock was to attend a concert in Orlando and that experience was really good.

We arrive at the hotel and the line to check in was really long.  We were put in a room overlooking the pool at the Paradise tower.  You can tell this hotel has some major mileage on it.  It's in need of a make-over and a serious deep-cleaning.  I had heard the new HRH tower was really nice but I guess we didn't get that option seeing we were using a Groupon.

We tried to hit the pool for just a little bit at 4:30pm when we got in.  Most of the pools were busy except for the Nirvana pool which had a couple of places open.  There were empty beer cans and cigarettes in the sand just about everywhere.  When we got back to the room to shower and change, I called the concierge desk to ask about renting one of the daybeds or cabanas for the next day.  They told me ""Lisa"" would call me back.  Hubby and I then wanted something to drink and we tried to open the mini bar.  Again, we called downstairs and they couldn't open it remotely.  The front desk lady said she'd send up an engineer to fix it.  The engineer never showed up in the 2 hours we were there.  

And the Daybed reservation?  Well, Lisa never did call back either.  When we got back that night at 1:30am, I called downstairs and told them I couldn't understand why I never got a call back and I was already pretty ticked off.  I felt like I was at some ghetto hotel and that's not what I wanted for Hubby's birthday.  I got a call back at 8am Friday from the manager and they told us we had a daybed and they reduced the minimum for us.  Now, the only thing I will share is they have a min drink and food order of $500 for the daybeds and more for the cabanas.  I thought we would meet the min they gave us for the day so I was good with reserving it.  We got down there and the DJ was playing some great jams and we started to drink and finally relax.  The pool water was nice and cold which was great given it was 104 outside.  

There were lots of people and I can only say that by 3:30pm, the place was a veritable zoo.  Many, many of the people were so drunk that they couldn't walk, and I will tell you that one couple - right in front of us - was ""doing it"" in the pool.  They thought they were being slick about it but EVERYONE around knew.  There was a group of guys that pointed to them and were busting out laughing.  At that point, we got out of the pool because I was totally disgusted.  I told one of the waitresses and she said that happens all the time.  Yikes.  I can say I took a really long shower that night and I still felt gross.

We didn't want to spend a lot of time at this hotel after that and frankly, we even looked into moving from here to the MGM or the Bellagio.  Every morning, the DJ did his sound checks at 9am and basically woke the whole hotel up.  I go on vacation to sleep in and that - along with everything else - made this memorable in bad way.  If you're into the more rank, drunken-mess type of fun, then you'd probably have a lot of fun here.  We like to have fun but I think we're more of an MGM Grand, Bellagio or Cosmopolitan hotel crowd.",7,1,2

I hate you. No really, I do. Ok, maybe it's not so much you but your patrons. Bleh. All that attitude and silicon can suck it! And I question your choice in music...c'mon Maroon Five and Matchbox 20?? More like SOFT Rock rather than HARD Rock....you are one step away from playing John Tesh.

Let's be clear, they have Rehab, big whoop.  Its a drunken mosh pit of rejects who think that binge drinking is the epitome of class, while sadly like the hotel, they have none.  

As for the hotel, if black were a color and dark and dingy were a fashion statement, this place would rein supreme - however for those of you that know better, this is not the place to be.  While the rooms in the HRH tower were nice, the hotel, like its staff, was old and outdated.

Bars and food, sure - like hotels they have them.  like other hotels, Hard Rock's were almost never open.  Who has a sports bar that is closed during the NBA and NHL playoff games - only agreeing to turn on the tv's after talking to several managers and still refusing to open the bar?  And once they open tell you that food service is available, but tell you that they can't send you a server so you have to go to one of the restaurants, order take out, and bring it back into the sports bar.  Need a drink - bar across the casino is open, but sorry - you can't order one in the sports bar!

Checking out - it takes a team of six (6) to find your bill and print it only to realize, they charged you incorrectly...but no worries, there is nothing the front desk gal can do...you have to deal with accounting that wants you to prove they messed up.  how do you prove you didn't charge anything to your room when they can't produce a receipt showing you did and you can't produce a receipt showing you didn't! Morons rule here!

I planned my trip to Vegas about a month before the horrible, unimaginable tragedy occurred just down the street at Mandalay Bay on 10\/1\/17. My heart goes out to all those affected by this horrific event. To be honest I contemplated on cancelling my trip. But as that saying goes, ""the show must go on."" I'm glad I went and I encourage people to continue to come to Vegas. We need to continue to support the Vegas community as it continues to heal #VEGASSTRONG.

If you are a music fan you will love this hotel +casino. If you like museums and history, this is also your place. They sprinkle enough memorabilia and photos throughout the casino\/hotel that you can walk around for hours admiring it. I stayed at HRC for two nights. Location wise it is about a 1 mile away from the strip which is equivalent to a 40 minute walk or 5 minute car ride or $6 Lyft. This was no biggie to me, because I spend a lot of my time in different parts of Vegas  and not necessarily on the strip, so this worked out perfectly for me. If you are driving a car around Vegas this is particularly convenient because you have easy access to back streets and other parts of town without having to hop onto Las Vegas Boulevard.

Originally I reserved a king size bed in a non-smoking bedroom but when I got there there was only a king in smoking or two queen beds with a view. I opted for the view and I did not regret it. My room had a great view of the backside of the strip and the LINQ ferris wheel. It's especially beautiful at night. My room was also directly above the two pools. One of which was closed the entire weekend. Rehab was not open either so it was a pretty quiet weekend. I'm going to go out on a limb and say there was just less tourists in town in general due to the recent events which probably was a factor.

Here's some pro's I enjoyed:
-Separate vanity from shower\/sink
-Large closet with sensor light inside
-Ample USB outlets to charge your electronics
-Room is spacious
-Actual door that you can open facing the pool with a high rail (no actual balcony)
-Lots of different lamps making lighting convenient and easy for getting ready
-Rock theme hotel but designed tastefully
-Free parking!
-The casino floor is not huge which makes getting to the hotel rooms and parking structure very accessible. This is important to save time but not great if you're only there to gamble
-Lots of fine dining options and a Dunkin Donuts which is open 24\/7
-Front desk and house keeping staff all very friendly

Cons
-No refrigerator. Only space for booze that you will get charged an arm and a leg for
-While you pay resort fees they charge an additional $10 to go to the pool. Why??
-Most third party sites will charge you for your room but will not include the mandatory resort fee that you will be charged at the hotel so be careful when booking. 

If you're looking to save a little money and don't mind being a mile off the strip this is a good choice. I would stay here again due to the convenience and service.",2,0,1

1) I am sure all hotels do this, but the front desk agent told me that she had a ""better"" option for me and was going to move me to this room as it had a ""better view.""  Now I reserved a suite in the HRH tower so was shocked when I opened the door to a small room and upon checking in I was told that my party has been down graded to a regular room because HRH over-booked. As any american would do in this situation, I called front desk immediately and complained - I was finally transferred to Grant the manager and he gave me the same apology. Now I understand if there is absolutely no suites available - but there has to be some sort of compensation for not providing me what I paid for! The only thing Grant offered me was a $50 food credit. He proceeded to try to sell me another single room at a discounted $150\/night so that I would have two rooms instead of one. At this point, it no longer became a monetary issue but purely one of principal - I paid for something and I should receive what I paid for especially since HRH e-mailed me 24 hours prior to my arrival confirming my suite! To anger me even more, Grand proceeded to say that HRH reserves the right to downgrade and this was in the ""small print"" - yes, he used the ""small print"" argument to justify their actions. A full hour wasted on the phone - conclusion - $50 food credit and a promise that he'd try to move me to the suite I originally reserved.   

2) Location location location - remember, this hotel is totally not on the strip. Although it may be a bit cheaper than other ""nice"" hotels the amount you use on taxis to go anywhere erases any money you think you're saving.

3) This hotel has some low class guests. I exited the elevator into the common elevator waiting area by my room around midnight and walked past a horrible sight - yes, there was a couple intimately involved in adult activities in the public elevator foyer! No joke - next time I go back to Vegas, I'm sticking with the Wynn or Cosmo - not worth saving a few bucks.",4,1,2

She then explained all the things it didn't cover and that we'd have to pay a resort fee even though all the pools and additional amenities were closed for renovation. The room itself was nice, but about the same as most hotels in this range in Vegas. The two stars comes from the sub par customer service. You know the douchebag bouncer types you have to deal with at a popular club? Well that's how pretty much every employee of this hotel acts. It's a shame because seeing all the memorabilia is a lot of fun.

=== === === === 
Casino rating: 5 stars
Hotel rating: 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 stars

The casino is a lot of fun. There's a ton of rock & roll memorabilia throughout the casino floor, including outfits, signed guitars, pictures of artists you won't see anywhere else, and other fun items. Amazing music plays all day\/night long, and kept me in the mood to gamble a little. Coming from a non-smoking city, I wasn't overly joyed that smoking was allowed in the casino but I expected it (I've been to Vegas before). Aside from gambling and memorabilia, you can do some fine eating, drinking, and shopping inside the casino. There were several restaurants, bars, a cafe, a Hard Rock shop, and a small general kind of store. The atmosphere in this area was light and fun. I enjoyed it quite a lot. 

The hotel room... sadly, was a different story. We stayed in the Casino Tower, which I think is their oldest tower - although it has been renovated to my understanding. The room, at first glance, looked pretty nice: a king bed, a sitting chair, a desk area with drawer space, a flat screen TV on the wall, and a small bathroom. Pretty standard. Being on the fourth floor, the view was kind of hideous as it overlooked the rooftop, so we kept the shades shut. The TV was old and took a few seconds of lag to switch between channels - not a big deal. The bed was firmer than I'm used to, which I can adjust, but the pillows were both full feather pillows and as soon as you put your head on them they went flat. That, I cannot deal with and it was a struggle all night to get comfortable. Not to mention, I found a strange stain on the sheets that looked like it could have been blood. Luckily, the cleaning staff was awesome and I asked the ladies to change the sheets and they did. 

The bathtub was oversized and would have been great for a bath, except for the fact that once you filled it and shut the water off it constantly dripped cold water at an unsteady pace. I said no to the bath, drained the tub, and took a shower instead. Needless to say, we spent as much time outside of the room as possible but when you're tired from exploring the strip or drinking and gambling, you want to have a nice room to go back to so you can relax. Unfortunately, this was not that room. So yeah, I'll be back to the casino but I probably won't stay at the hotel again -- at least not in the Casino Tower.",6,4,5

When we booked this room, I was really excited.  Based on what the pictures told me of our room & the price we were paying, I felt we were getting a pretty good deal.  I had to phone the hotel a couple of times prior to our arrival, & each time was an awesome experience from a customer service perspective.  Everyone was super friendly & although I'm sure busy, I never felt as if they were trying to get me off the phone. They were patient, always had an answer for my question & made me feel as if my call was important, no matter how trivial it might have been.
Upon arrival to the hotel, I was instantly impressed.  When we walked in to the main lobby, the aroma of incense filled the air.  Good incense too, seemingly nag champa, but I could've been mistaken.  
We made our way over to the registration desk.  Being it was only a Thursday, there was relatively no wait.  All the clerks were busy, but we were next up in line.  When we got our turn,  I h&ed my ID to the clerk.  She welcomed us, went through the typical, ""Staying with us 2 nights?"", etc.  Then she says, ""Oh, you're actually staying in our HRH Tower, that check in counter is..."" & she pointed us in the direction of that area.  Which was on the other side of the casino.  Because it wasn't busy, it wasn't much of an issue.  But had I stood in the check-in line on Friday, & then found out after that long wait that I had to go somewhere else, I would have been a little upset.  My only suggesetion is maybe a sign at the end of the registration desk that points people to the HRH tower check-in desk.
We checked in with relative ease.  Upon completion of our check-in the clerk gave us his name, which I believe was Matthew, & told us if we needed anything to give a call.
We made our way up to the room not sure what to expect but anxiously anticipating what we saw in pictures.  As we opened the door, we entered a room that did look exactly like every picture that I saw. In fact, if I didn't know better I would think we were staying in the room where the pictures were taken.  Kudos to that HRH Vegas. As many of us have found in the past, reality often doesn't live up to the hype in which the pictures give off.
I'm the type of person, that when I first get in to a hotel room I like to scope it out.  I go through the entire room looking at things, finding things.  I don't know why, I just do.  On my first trip around, I found the in-wall mounted iPod docking staton with interactive touchscreen controls.  This control panel not only worked in conjuction with my iPod, but there were built in music playlists as well.  SCORE! Right away, I set my iPod up, & that's where it stayed for the duration.
The bathroom was a little bigger than I thought it would be.  My only complaint there, no jets in the tub.  I guess that's  not really a complaint as much as it is me being bratty. LOL!
I will say, overall, I only had one major complaint about the room.  I do realize we chose a smoking room.  However, there was a very noticeable burn hole in the middle of one of the couch cushions.  Being an eggshell colored couch, it could not be missed.  I feel as if a place like HRH should have either flipped the cushion or had it replaced.  I'm sure they could afford to have it replaced.  We had this really nice room, with this one little piece that I felt tainted the room a tad.  But I got over it & decided to just not look at that part of the couch.
On Friday, upon our return to the room in the afteroon, the maid had left quite a large stack of linens on the dresser.  It wasn't that big of a deal. I called down to housekeeping & advised them.  She said she would send someone up.  I told her there was a maid & car 4 rooms down & I could give them to her.  She said, ""No, that's okay. I'll send someone for them"".  I thought that was awesome because it would have been quite easy for me to give them to the maid, but she insisted that someone from their staff would come & get them.
Our first day there we decided to lunch at Pink Taco because they were advertising 99 cent tacos & margaritas.  I had seen an ad before we even got to Vegas & again once we arrived at the hotel.
What is not clearly indicated in ANY of the ads is that the tacos are chicken only (which does me no good), you can only get one order of 5 per person, & it's on valid for Rockstar Club members.  Sorely dissapointed in that lack of clarification.
Our last day we ate at Mr Lucky's for breakfast.  Delicious.  Even though there was a line, we didn't wait long & our server helped us right away.  We were in & out of there quickly, but never felt rushed by anyone.
My overall impression of this hotel & casino is quite favorable.  I really loved the experience.
previously mentioned.
I've already decided that upon my return to Vegas I will be staying at the hotel again.  Great environment, excellent customer service, & seemingly no pretentious attitude from any staff.",3,0,1

The customer service is ok. Rooms are not good. Feel a little dirty actually, but I really wasn't expecting much to begin with. 

Food at Mr. Lucky's is delicious & you get more than you can probably consume. Definitely the best part of this place that I witnessed. 

The demographic is young, trashy, drunk, drunk, and trashy. A big turnoff if you are a little more mature and put together. I was a fully-clothed sober woman minding my own business with a ring on my finger & the way 20 year olds hit on me was appalling. 

Airplanes were flying very close by our window, but that wasn't what woke me up. Every night (morning) there were inebriated people yelling in the hallway, including one man who apparently couldn't find his friend Dan at 2 am. ""Dan?! Dan?! Where are you?!!!"" Annoying.

We really wanted an amazing Vegas experience so we opted for an expensive suite instead of a $29 room. We even paid a little more to ensure we had a nice pool view. When we got into our room we were VERY disappointed. They put us in a room all the way down the hall way past the pool, and on a low floor, so the only thing we had a view of was a vacant parking lot. We immediately went down to the front desk with our concerns hoping they would rectify the situation. Unfortunately the opposite happened. We first spoke to a front desk agent who informed us they had a lot of VIP check ins that weekend so they would not be able to move us. I didnt understand how this was possible when we had reserved a room and paid extra for a suite with a view months ago but she seemed to care less, so I asked to speak to a manager. Things just got worse from there. Deon, the front desk manager on duty, came out to speak with us. He was very short, rude and unhelpful. I have never been treated worse by a hotel employee and I was shocked by his demeanor seeing as he was a manager of the Hardrock. We explained to him how we were here to celebrate our best friends bachelorette and this was not how we expected to start our celebratory weekend and we just wanted the room that we had reserved and paid for. He claimed the only thing he could do was move us about 4 rooms down on the same floor. We said we would we go and check it out and see if it was better. It was literally almost the same view but this time there were holes and stains on the carpet and about 10 cigarette butts right outside the door. We go back down to talk to Deon again he dosnt apologize, dosnt really seem to care he is ruining our evening, dosnt offer any solutions, nothing. At this point its been over an hour we are dealing with this, we have now missed our dinner reservations and nothing is being done to help our situation. I finally get fed up and tell Deon if he isnt willing to rectify the situation then we will switch hotels. He literally says 'ok bye'. I could not believe it!! I dont know what kind of training is given but it is never ok to treat your guests in this manner! Hardrock and Deon stressed us out and put a big damper on our big bachelorette weekend. We had to wake up nice and early the next morning and find a new hotel, once again ruining our plans for that day. On top of all this, I slept in a blood stained bed! I didnt notice before I got into bed because the bride was so upset and stressed out she went to bed early so I got into bed in the dark. I woke up horrified!! I will attach pics for you to see for yourself. I am horrified by my experience and will never be returning to any Hardrock hotel!! Also beware there is construction going on and they dont tell you before. Seeing as im very allergic to dust, this was just the icing on the cake!!",1,1,0

Some of the best restaurants in town are either in the hotel or within walking distance. We typically eat at the steakhouse in the Hard Rock and I have nothing but good things to say about it as well.

I highly recommend staying at this location whenever you get a chance.

I had the pleasure of meeting Matthew Baird, the guest relations manager during my last trip, and he completely affirmed all of my feeling about this hotel by making me feel very welcome and providing a personal touch whenever needed.

We had the do not disturb sign up the whole time, and the maid still came in our room, which really bothered me. 

Our TV also had a big gouge in the screen and a huge scratch. 

It is a ways from the strip.  We didn't think it was THAT far, so decided to walk to the strip... bad idea, take a cab. They have a shuttle that takes you to the strip during the day time, which we didn't take advantage of.

I was in aw on how modern everything was. The beds were comfy and clean. The view was alright but I can't complain! The only downfall of the room was that the shower head sucks!!!! The water pressure was so low and the shower head would turn off by itself after like 5 minutes. 

Room service was prompt and food is not bad at all. Also, room service is 24\/7! Their day time casino servers are definitely more happy then night time servers. The hard rock has a couple of pools but I only had the opportunity to sun bathe at their family pool (not sure what the pool is called). Pool staff checks your room key before entrance and they ask you how many towels you would like then you can skip your way to the pool. Valet staff is awesome in the day time but at night or early mornings, they seem to be understaffed.

The HRH tower suites are very nice. They're spacious and well designed. I could live in the bathroom. There's a huge tub and a separate shower. I've never had an issue with noise, though I've always been in floors that are pretty high up. Although, the pool is sort of loud when they play music.

First of all, this new construction has totally ruined the original look of the Hard Rock.  I liked the single white hotel tower. But, now it's obstructed by the new Joint & 2 modern hotel towers on each side.

Now onto the room in the Paradise Tower - The route you have to take to even get to your room in the Paradise Tower is really long.  But, maybe they will fix that after all the construction is done.

The lighting in the bathroom\/mini bar\/closet section is just horrible.  Good lighting in a hotel bathroom is a MUST!

The bathroom is divided into 2 sections - one section is a toilet\/shower, and the other is a double vanity section.  I like the idea of that, but the toilet\/shower section is too small.  I smashed my foot at one point with that obnoxious door.  I did like the stainless steel door handle, though.  I like the double sink vanity, but the actual sink\/faucet is terrible.  I've never seen so much water splash onto the countertops.  Plus, the countertops are black, so when the water is splashed it leaves a bad hard water looking stain.  There should be a maid in the room at all times wiping down the countertop.

The rooms do have hair dryers & irons, but they should have bought the ones that have retractable cords.  Oh, and that noisy ironing board was like nails on a chalk board.

Noise!  Usually when I go to a hotel I like to get a good night sleep.  Don't expect that in the Paradise Tower.  The conversations in the room next door could clearly be heard, as well as the ones out in the hallway.

I did like the view from the room, which was a partial view of the strip.

Next time I stay at the Hard Rock, I will just stay in the original tower.  I think the rooms are cheaper there anyway.

5 Stars for the friendly staff!  Everyone says hello, and asks how your stay is.",3,3,2

On MLK weekend Sunday night, there was ample room throughout the casino that you could grab a seat at any table game with it being no more than half full (I prefer to gamble with a smaller crowd and individuals not new to the game).

As for the hotel itself- its off the strip but not miles away. Come on walking off that drunken stupor might be a good idea. If not, there's plenty of cabs and I believe a shuttle service from the hotel- maybe- maybe not??? 

The decor is all rock memorabilia and some pretty cool stuff at that.

You'll be paying for a mid-tier kind of hotel and if you're not familiar with the Hard Rock Hotel brand, you'll be getting a lot of rock-and-roll references throughout the hotel.  However, when I was there the last two times, the music was a bit hit-or-miss and the room decor was a bit all over the place.  Something to be aware of.  Rooms were also a bit of a mess.  Try to stay in the newer Paradise rooms rather than the HRH basic ones.  Although the newer rooms were still a bit dark with low water pressure for the showers\/sinks, at least they were bigger and more spacious than the older rooms that were even darker and cramped than the newer ones.  Additionally, the food was a bit spotty as well.  Culinary Dropout is probably your go-to-place here.  

The entertainment is also a little bit all over.  Body English isn't what it used to be compared to the other hot nightclubs in Vegas and some of the bars are a bit hit-or-miss.  The pools in the summer are nice though with enough variety and dayclub space for partying.  The best part of Hard Rock is still probably the Joint and the adjoining musical venue.  Even though the acts themselves may be all over the place, the venue rocks out (no pun intended) with great acoustics and a terrific stage.

And of course, the final issue is that you're not near the Strip here.  There is a daytime shuttle that has a terrible schedule of going back-and-forth so your best bet is to drive or taxi it up.  Heads-up.

If you want to be treated like crap, this is the place to stay.  Their location is off the strip and away from anything.  It is a walkable distance but not short enough where you would want to make more than one round trip to the Strip per day.  The cost for taxi from Hard Rock to the Strip is about $10 plus tip.  

The worst part about our stay was the services.  It was not about bad service from one person; it was about their entire staff -- from the doorman (non-existence), to the front desk to the concierge to the staff in the restaurant.  When we arrived, there were no doorman and they don't have any automatic door (not even the kind with handicap buttons).  As you can imagine, getting through the doors with all the luggage was not fun.  The staff there all think they are the rock stars and hate to answer any questions.  When we checked in, I saw their signs about new tower opened so I asked what's the difference between the rooms in the different towers.  You can see the look on her face that she thinks I am wasting her time.  We stayed in the Casino tower.  The room was pretty standard -- what you would expect from any 3 star hotels.  We also asked the concierge to get us on the guest list for club.  Again, the attitude was that she can't be bothered and she never called us on whether she got us on or not.  I wasn't surprised about the not calling part because as soon as I asked her the question, by the look on her face, I knew she wasn't going to even try.  When we checked out, our rental car wasn't ready so we decided to grab a bite to eat while waiting for the car.  Since we were well aware we had luggage, we went to Pink Taco since they were only about 25% full so we won't be in the way.  The lay out of the restaurant was bar in the middle with stools, and tables along the 3 walls.  One section was raised on a platform and you have to go up couple of steps to get to the tables.  Guess which tables the hostess tried to lead us to ... the ones up the steps.  So I asked her that we want a table that doesn't require us moving luggage up steps (keep in mind that over 75% of the restaurant was empty).  And she didn't want to because the tables on the platform were smaller table and she didn't want to waste a big table on us.  I ended up asking her for the table along the back wall because 1) that whole section was empty 2) the table only seats 4 so it was not a big table.  Later my husband told me that the other hostess who saw us coming in rolled her eyes when we walked in.  I can understand how luggage is inconvenience but she shouldn't had showed it and the place was mostly empty!  The food was not great either.  I had the Pink Taco since I figured it was named after the place, it should be their specialty.  The tacos only had one flavor ... salty.  

The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because the Hertz person was super nice ... then again, he worked for Hertz and not Hard Rock.",0,0,0

This is a party type hotel so you will hear music & see loud young people running about but they seem to gave enough security people around to keep that in line. They only have two check in areas for this huge place which is sort of a pain but check in first then find your building where your room in. They don't allow coolers and the minibar is for their high priced stuff that if you touch it you have bought it so don't touch that stuff (it has sensors to tell them you moved it). You can fill one of the sinks with ice which is what we did. If you eat at one of their restaurants show your room key for the hotel guest price which is cheaper & they gave us a coupon book for those places, too. Mr. Lucky's, Pink Taco, and the Asian restaurant were pretty good I thought. You need your room key to go up and down the elevator. Our room was nice, clean, and everything was fairly new.

I will start with valet! Valet has very professional and courteous employees that take your car for you and actually they move pretty fast for having as few ppl working that they did. I recently stayed during a pretty hectic weekend aka Mayweather fight weekend along with the pool party being thrown at REHAB! I actually only ended up getting a hotel here by default because for those of you who don't know when you are a hotel guest you get special discounted tickets on REHAB events along with other things that take place during your stay! Also there is a dedicated line for hotel guest as well when you attend your event. The hotel room itself was located in the Casino Tower my room was a pool view on the 11th floor which I feel like was the best location to stay! Beware though of you are wanting a quiet and relaxing stay this tower or view would not be ideal as the music from REHAB is LOUD and you can hear everything regardless if your balcony doors are shut or not! Overall the stay was good! I would stay again and maybe check out the HRH Tower Suites!,1,1,2

Was there 3 days before Memorial day and left on Friday. READ the hotel's policies. Almost all Vegas places have ""resort fees"" that may not show up without web-digging, These ""fees"" are just a means to fool the unwashed as to the actual rate. No big deal as a $40.00 or so room in a trendy Vegas hotel is non-existent. I booked a king non-smoking room in the Casino (cheapest) Tower. Check in time is 3:00 and I show up at 2. My ""room"" was not ready and clerk offered a smoking (???) room. Got that sort of fixed, being patient and calm. Ended up with 2 queen beds and a view of roof & wall on second floor. If you do the Casino Tower, try to get a room on an upper floor. Room was okay, no problems but would have preferred king bed as room was a bit cramped with just an overstuffed chair and straight backed chair for the wall desk. Was looking for a couch. WiFi in room was workable. Interesting clock radio has a CD player (!!) built in. No iPhone inputs, but there are plugs on the desk for recharging. Again, this is this oldest tower on the property. Bed was fine an floor I was on was quiet. Pool use was odd. They list 3 pools, but  really only 1 is available. The ""Rehab"" pool is now a day club that requires extra admission. The ""Breath"" pool is\/was not available and is being ""repositioned"" as an off limits for rent area.Things change during the year, as i understand.  The ""Nirvana"" is huge and served my purpose. Other reviewers will fill you in, but I had a fine time. Security is a big deal here as I guess problems have arisen. Had a fun talk with one of these folk.The swim-up blackjack was not in operation and this feature may or may not be in use, depending on hotel vacancy rate. Had a meal at Mr Lucky's that was fine. Casino betting miniums will vary and were $15.00, mostly. Hotel IS for adults as no arrangements for kids are available. If you self park (I drove up from LA) you will walk some (!) unless you book the HRH Tower, the newest and most expensive. Would stay again if I get a good rate. You must remember, this is a rock 'n' roll-themed casino resort and is a block from the University Nevada, Las Vegas campus. Lots of inked up hipsters here, but then I am an old R&R fart.

Great big bed, great big shower, HUGE bathtub.

And the bathtub is why this lost a star...

We got in, and noticed there were a lot of ""floaties"" in the water with us. White, flakey floaties... Now as this is the HR, one could assume those were biological floaties. That's not cool.

Paid something like $100 for the room for the night. The $20 ""resort fee"" is bullshit, and that needs to be dropped, but over all a good stay. The GF was all excited as there is a Nobu downstairs, but we didn't get to go in due to being off on the hours. 

I'd stay somewhere else next time though. The $15 trips back and forth to the Strip added up quickly, especially with Las Vegas cabbies being on the grift with their meters.

What sticks out in my mind about my first visit was the check-in.  I pulled up front, and followed the signs to self-parking (I refuse to valet, it's just ludicrous).  It was quite a trek from the parking to the front desk, and after 3 1\/2 hours of driving and having been up for 28 hours at this point, I was not feeling that.  

So, we checked in and were told we were in the Paradise tower - though the other half of our team was in the HRH tower.  We had a bellhop come and help us with our considerable luggage and set off on the 9-mile hike from the front desk to our room in the Paradise tower.  Of course, it was the very last room on the floor, and since the self parking I was directed to was adjacent to the HRH tower, I was as far as humanly possible from my car while still being on the same property.  

At the room at last, we go in and are greeted by an oppressive heat, and a single King sized bed.  Being on a business trip with a fellow heterosexual male, this was simply not going to work.  We called down to the front desk to get it all sorted.  We asked at that time, since we were going to have to switch rooms anyway, could we relocate to the HRH tower to be nearer to our coworkers and were told there was nothing available in that tower, but we would get another room in this same tower, and they would send the bellhop with the keys and luggage cart.

30 minutes later (a wait yes, but remember the distance from the front desk is ridiculous), we were on our way to our new room.  When we arrived I noticed an 'All tied up' sign on the door (I later learned this is their DND sign), still we opened the door only to discover a young couple mid-coitus.  Yes, they had assigned us to an occupied room.  

By this time we were extremely frustrated and exhausted.  We went all the way BACK to the front desk, raised a little hell, and eventually got a room in the HRH tower (yes the one with no availability) right across the hall from our co-workers.  Ok cool, though why we were lied to earlier, I still don't know.

The room itself had a cool aesthetic, but it was all just a veneer.  The appointments were cheap and kind of tacky, and you could see some things were already falling apart.  

That brings us to the second trip.  This time around, the check-in was much smoother, and we got the right room on the first try, again in the Paradise tower.  A fairly average room, our one big complaint was that the beds are just waaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy too soft.  I know there are some people who like that, but I really think they should cater to the middle.  Also, the closet in which they place the toilet and shower is joke.  Additionally, on the first night, I was so dehydrated that I splunked down for a $7.50 1L bottle of Smart Water.  I still had a bout a third of it left sitting on the nightstand the next morning.  When we came back to the room, the maid had removed it!  WTF?!?!  There was still like $3 worth of water in there.  Bad form, very very bad form. 


The rating overall reflects my frustration with the service on our first stay, the overall lack of attention to detail, the inconvenient location with respect to the strip, and the 'we are trying too hard to be cool' vibe that permeates the place.

I was there this last time for just a day and ordered room service. The food is delicious and they are so accommodating. I wanted cookies, but they only sold them by the dozen. The chef offered to send me a few for a few dollars. WORTH IT. They were so good!

The overall experience was positive and I would stay here again if I wanted to see a band that was playing at the Joint. BTW, GNR rocks...3 hour shows that you have to see. Axl's voice is superb and the band is tight. You get dancers, Axl, and rock n' roll in an excellent venue. What is not to like? Security in The Joint can be a bit of pain because they are uptight jerks, but that can be overlooked. Overall the room was comfortable and a good deal at Thanksgiving. The hotel is off the strip but convenient to the airport and to many good restaurants that are in walking distance. Plus there is a liquor market across the street so you don't have to pay the inflated prices at the bars inside the hotel. 

Positives:
We stayed in the Casino Tower. Our room was large and clean. We had a mountain view. The room was actually pretty quiet. The king bed was large and super soft. Bathroom was good size and the towels were soft. Overall, a very nice room that exceeded expectations. The gift shop is good. There are ample choices for eating and drinking onsite (though not really cheap). I loved all the rock picts and memorabilia throughout. You can spend an hour or two just walking and looking at everything. There is free parking! 

Negatives:
For some odd reason, there is not a coffee machine in the room. I cannot remember the last hotel where I stayed that did not have a coffee machine or hot water heater for tea. I guess they want you to buy coffee downstairs at the Fuel Express. The bathroom does not have a fan so that after the shower the mirror is fogged...not a big deal but upper end places tend to have a fan. The gaming area is pretty lame compared to the larger hotels and casinos on the strip. 

The biggest negative is the obligatory ""resort fee"" that was $22 a day (plus tax), so basically $25 in November 2012. It included wi-fi (which had a good speed so we could watch Netflix movies on the ipad), a notary if you want to get married or divorced, access to the gym, and complimentary printing of boarding passes. I don't really think that it is a good deal.

This fee makes me mad. If I did not have an ipad or laptop, was not getting married or divorced, did not want to use the gym, and wanted to print my boarding passes at the airport, the fee would be for nothing. But I would have to pay. There is no choice. We used the wi-fi but at $25 a day it is way over-priced. Upper end hotels charge $14.95 a day for wi-fi, and the choice rests with the customer. This practice of adding obligatory resort fees is dishonest and is a main reason I would not stay here again unless I had to in order to see a concert at The Joint. I can stay at Bellagio and not pay a resort fee. 

The experience was basically positive but the resort fee is dishonest and would keep me away.",1,0,0

My friends and I thought we got a great deal here because it was 30% off for summer nights or whatever. Sadly, it does not even throw off the hidden fees that get tacked onto your bill. 

The rooms were okay, but the shower was freaking short. I'm 5 ft 2 inches and I was able to reach the top of the ceiling, how is anyone that is super tall able to shower?! 

Anyways, there was a security deposit fee that is non-refundable that is $30. On top of that we didn't notice that there is a $15.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the overall price when you check-out. It came out to like $16.80 with tax each day for this service. The resort fee ""covers 2 complimentary rock spa gym passes per registered guest per day, strip shuttle service 10am-6pm 7 days a week, free local and long distances phone calls within the contiguous 48 states valet parking is complimentary and available at all times to hotel guests."" 

The only thing that bugs me about this service is that we had to PAY for complimentary services, seriously, WHAT THE FUCK. They don't even mention this at all and leave a tiny card as a little disclaimer where your card keys all. 

Another thing that baffles me is how Hard Rock Hotel's website shows pools that are all lit up and pretty at night. Thing is.. they close off the pool the moment it hits sunset. 

The last final thing that bugged me was that we did get minibar charges and we didn't touch anything at all, my friends and I made sure we weren't even close to the censors, but somehow we still got charged. At least, reception was able to clear that up right away. 

The only good thing was the one worker that opened the door for us while we were leaving. I guess that was the only good service about it and that's probably because he saw how angry we were and how we wanted to get out fast.

However, during our stay, my friend and I realized why the rates are so low compared to the other, newer hotels in Vegas.  

First of all, I was surprised to see that the cleanliness and maitenance of the rooms have deteriorated since my prior visits, and nothing has been done to upgrade or match other nicer hotels.  The rooms and bathrooms are dirtier than I remember, and our particular room smelled like smoke.  Furthermore, none of our shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion convenience items were replaced at all on 2 of the 3 days during our stay.  

I used to come here in the past to hang at the 'Circle Bar' located in the center of the casino area....and it used to be a great 'meet' spot for women, however, women are hanging out at other hotels (esp. Cosmopolitan and Encore) now, even when not going to clubs, etc.  HRH is a ""sword-fight"" now for simply hanging out.  REHAB is pretty much the same from what I remember, definitely NOT better or improved, and I've come to realize that the actual pool iteself sucks compared to the other newer hotels and their pool-party options now.  After spending time at the pool parties outside REHAB, you will get the same thing at the Palms, Wet Republic, Encore, Cosmopolitan's Marquis, etc., with a contemporary and hip scene, as well as state-of-the-art stereo and almost concert-like experiences.  REHAB used to be THE place, but is mediocre at best now.  If you've been in the past, try another spot from what I hear, you're better off.  We only went to REHAB because we thought as a guest we would possibly receive preferential treatment compared to Non-Guests. NOT!!!  I realize being a guy I would have to wait in line, but girls staying at the hotel also had to wait in line and pay $75 cover just to use the pool on Sunday.  It's $60 before noon I think.  There is NO benefit to you at all as a guest at HRH in getting into REHAB.  No special line or rates, etc.  

Finally, during our automated ('Quick') checkout via the room tv, we discovered there was a $20\/day ""Resort Fee"" added to our weekend hotel bill.  Upon calling the front desk, it was explained to me that this is a MANDATORY extra charge given to every room for WiFi\/Internet access, etc., even if you don't use it, or didn't bring a laptop in the first place!!!    Staff on phone stated that this was explained to me in detail upon check-in, and since I was the one checking us in that weekend (sober I might add), I assure you that it was NOT explained at all.  

These are the little EXTRA 'bend over' charges that were hidden upon booking room at HRH, and I will NOT be staying here in the future.  There are better options in Vegas now elsewhere, you will see if you don't already know...",1,0,0

A few years ago, we stayed in the HRH tower in a king suite.  The king suites feature, according to the website, a ""tea for two"" soaking tub.  Since the ""we"" in this narrative involves my 6'8"" boyfriend, this was a big selling point for us.  We booked it, the tub was as advertised, and we were pretty pleased with the room overall.  Cut to this past weekend, 2 1\/2 years after that stay.  When booking this time, we made sure to reserve the same room type.  We checked it, went up to our room in the HRH Tower and were greeted with a standard sized bathtub.  Now, we of course had plans for the weekend that went beyond bathing, but a large factor of rebooking this hotel and that room type was the tub.  We called the desk and found out that at check-in, we had been assigned to an accessible room.  Almost the same.  But not.  We explained why we had reserved that room type (at a premium, no less), and were assured we would be moved to the appropriate room the next day.  We weren't seeking an upgrade, mind you, just the room we had originally asked for.  
The next day came and, as promised, they moved us... to a suite in the Casino Tower. Still not the room type we had requested.  It was a larger room overall, but featured a standard shower\/tub combo, even smaller than the tub in the accessible suite (it had jets but was about the same size as any shower\/tub combo you'd get at a 1 - 3 star hotel).  The night before when we had called, we had been completely clear about what we were looking for, and my boyfriend even stated his height and the fact he wanted a tub he could actually fit in.  From room #2, I called the front desk again.  I spoke to the desk agent who implied that the only option would be to pay the difference to upgrade to a villa.  At that point, I asked for a manager. After a lengthy hold (during which my boyfriend started to recite the hold message, down to the fake English accent of the speaker, because he had been on hold long enough the night before), I spoke to a woman who sounded at best bored and at worst annoyed to be speaking to me.  I should point out here- I worked in the hotel industry for about 10 years doing exactly this woman's job- I was the Director of Rooms at my last property and I have consistently made it a point to be as agreeable and understanding as possible as a hotel guest because OMG have I been there a million times.  So, imaging my dismay when I was told by this manager that she didn't know what the room's features were, or what the difference was from one room type to another.  The description is with the room type in the reservation system!  Finally, after speaking in a way that made it clear I was wasting her time but she would just humor me to get off the phone, we were moved to a third room.  This one, finally, was the room we had reserved way back in March.  
While we were waiting in room #2 for the keys to room #3, housekeeping came to the door.  One of the housekeeping managers\/supervisors came in and talked to us. Room #2 had shown up on her list out of the blue, and she was checking to see why.  I really regret to say I did not get her name, because she was wonderful.  She came in and talked to us at length, and unlike the front desk actually listened to what we were saying to her.  She double checked what room number we were being moved to and verified it was what we were looking for.  She was also surprised that we had been moved from the HRH Tower to the Casino Tower, but I don't know enough about the property to know why.  I can say if you are booking and wondering what the difference is, the most notable one (aside from the notorious bathtub) is the noise- Casino Tower overlooks the pool, while HRH tower overlooks the city.  The pool is much noisier, but we were not in there long enough to know how that really works out in the long run.  

I do wish Tubgate was where it ended, but it wasn't.  The hotel was insanely busy all weekend (yay for robust business) but did not seem adequately staffed in their F&B outlets.  Room service Saturday morning took almost an hour and a half (for scrambled eggs, oatmeal and coffee), and we had to abandon Mr. Lucky's Sunday morning when, after waiting 40 minutes from placing our order, our food was nowhere in sight and we had to leave for the airport.  I get that they were slammed, and our waitress was very apologetic, but we had given ourselves nearly an hour to eat before we needed to leave for the airport.  By what our waitress said at the time we told her we were leaving, it sounded like the kitchen hadn't even gotten to our order yet.  
All in all, as fun as it is to say ""we're staying at the Hard Rock,"" the fun sadly ends with the sentence.  We won't be back.",4,0,1

We were having a party.  When we checked in they said that was no longer avail., O.K., bummer but what can you do?  Next they said the room wasn't ready yet so we went and had lunch came back at 3:00 room still wasn't ready.  I guess someone threw up in the suite the night before and they were shampooing the carpets but couldn't get the smell out.  The front desk person said they would talk to the manager and try to upgrade us.  She came back and said there were no more suites avail.  I told her someone form the Hotel had contacted me the day before asking me if I wanted to upgrade, they were clearly lying.  I did get the upgrade.  The next day I was to move to a standard room and was told it wouldn't  be ready until noon.  Not a problem, my husband and I went down for breakfast only to come back to being locked out of our room.  It too a half an hour for them to let us back in.

This hotel is a glorified dormitory.  Drunk girls EVERYWHERE.  One girl was throwing up in the hotel hallway.  The rooms are disgusting.  I feel so sorry for the housekeeping who have to work at this hotel.  It is just damage control.

I was told by an employee the on Sundays (Rehab the pool party) makes more on that one day in alcohol  than the entire hotel does in one week.  By the way that was so difficult to watch as I was waiting for a taxi at valet these people STAGGERING drunk out front from their day of drinking at Rehab.  There are ambulances in the back parking lot every Sunday just dealing with the dehydration and alcohol poisoning on Sundays.

The one think I will say is the the bellmen and valet were very helpful and nice.  The food at the 24 hour restaurant was very good.

1.  Room was great.  Clean and nice, very comfortable bed and great bathroom.  
2.  Pool was unbelievably awesome.  Fun, all adults only.
3.  Quality hotel in general.  
4.  House keeping was on top of cleaning and was convenient.
5.  good restaurants.


(-)
1.  experienced multiple times of bad drink service while gambling.  Two different days at different table games, waitresses took over 30 minutes just to come to take orders (HORRIBLE).  Even when I did see them on a 'regular' basis, they are slower when compared to the many other places I have been to (caesars, flamingo, etc).

2.  Sunday REHAB pool.  The pool was just as fun on friday and saturday.  On sunday, it is like airport security where you are padded down and everything searched, and lots of lines, and just a turn off in my opinion.  The wrong GHETTO crowd was attracted as well = horrible.

3.  They are on their own rewards program, so I couldn't use points towards the stay.  And their table games didn't seem to be as good at earning points.


Overall, I would rather stay at a place on the strip where I can use HARRAHS points and have more options of places to walk to.",0,0,0

However, staying at the hard rock was an absolute nightmare. From the moment we pulled up the valet was extremely rude. It was memorial weekend so I understand that it was busy but the treatment he gave my friend and I was horrible. He acted like we were dumb females that couldn't wrap our minds around what he was saying. All he had to say was please pull ahead and park in the garage, we are at capacity.

After spending an hour looking for a spot in the garage, we checked in. The room looked nice at first but once you try to turn on the lights it's a whole different story especially since half of them didn't work. To clarify, we had upgraded to the HRH tower so we were expecting more of the room than just your standard Vegas hotel room. The bathroom was nice if you were with your lover. The shower and bathroom doors are clear. Not ideal when it's just you and a friend. Not to mention,  the toilet constantly made a hissing noise throughout the whole stay.

Now the big problem I have with this hotel is why I'm writing. We booked this room instead of another because we wanted first access to the rehab pool party... This is where the bad dream turned into a nightmare.

After waiting 4 hours in line to get the wristbands and being told the system was down (manager confirmed that was a lie), people started getting antsy. 

The area was littered with security who just stood around and did nothing. Eventually people decided it was time to riot... My friend and I got shoved to the ground and thrown through a door where we waited until everyone calmed down. People were screaming and running and I had assumed the worst before knowing what actually happened. I feared for my life as did many people I talked to.

I tried to talk to a security guard who explained he was freelance and to talk to the front desk. I spoke to the woman at the front desk who although very disinterested eventually agreed to call a manager who said head of security would be right over. A half hour later and he still hasn't shown up so I called the manager myself. Allison (the manager) agreed to have security meet us back at our room because we did not feel safe.

I have now been waiting for over an hour and called twice and security still has not shown up. I explained to Allison that having waited all morning in a line to get shoved to the ground we were starving and could not wait any longer to eat, she offered us an in-room dining credit (the first glimpse of any customer service this far) and asked us to please continue to wait for security.

Still waiting... It's absolutely disheartening the lack of concern they have for their guests.",10,2,2

As a Backstage Pass holder I called to cash in on my comps for this reservation. For some reason, I was given 3 different consecutive reservations for a 6 night stay. 

On my 3rd morning I received a call from the front desk telling me to leave my room because my reservation was cancelled. I told them they were wrong & to talk to a manager. The woman said she was a manager and continued to tell me I needed to leave & proceeded to turn my keys off. She insisted that I cancelled my reservation when I checked in, even though that made no sense & I stated I did not.  

Meanwhile, I was looking at charges & email confirmations for my reservation through Friday. I went downstairs in my pajamas to straighten this out and was obviously locked out. Ultimately, they were proven wrong but treated me like shit in the process. 

Since proving my reservation to them, I now have to stand in line for 20 minutes a day and get new keys for my room. Also, my ability to charge to my room is turned off everyday requiring 20 minutes in line or on the phone to resolve.

Horrible planning of Hard Rock Casino causes fans paying $50 for Superbowl party to wait 2-3 hours in line to buy tickets and then seats them in the back of the theater where the view of the MAIN TV SCREEN IS OBSTRUCTED by a 40 foot light bar used to light the stage for Motley Crue band. There is no clear view around the light bar that measures around 40 feet across and 4 feet in height. It literally blocks everybody on the 3rd floor from seeing 40-50% of the TV screen.  The 2 screens immediately flanking the main screen are low-resolution and meant for concerts- not for watching a TV game.  They are like watching the game on a Lite Brite toy.  There were 2 smaller HD projection screens flanking the Lite Brite screens, but they were really not watchable since they are mounted on walls that are sideways viewing to the main audience.  For those fans paying $50 there is free food and 6 beers but it's located on the 1st floor in very front...and you are seated in the 3rd floor at the back of the theater. It takes about 30 minutes to leave your seat, grab food, and hike 3 floors to the back of the room. Food was simple hot dogs, nachos, chicken sliders, philly cheese steaks.  The quality of food was cheap, but better than some other places.  The ground floor seating has folding chairs, is FREE, and has a clear and unobstructed view of the main screen. The audio sound was fine and loud enough- they used the speakers for the band.  There was a gambling area in the front of the Superbowl Party, but I never went there.  Too crowded and I wanted to try to watch the game.

In the grand scheme of making money, the Hard Rock did Superbowl fans wrong. 

It put the paying customers in the worst position for watching the game and created a lasting memory of wasting everybody's time waiting in line for coveted tickets only to short them on the viewing experience. I will never come back to the Joint at Hard Rock for a $50 Superbowl party and I highly recommend that you go elsewhere... unless you don't care about seeing a screen that only shows you 40% of the game.  

How to fix this? If anybody from Hard Rock management sees my Yelp post: Sell those $50 tickets with a more efficient system.  It is not acceptable to have a 2-3 hour line with limited seats.  You had 3 cashiers trying to take money, write down driver's license numbers, and also work the Hard Rock merchandise store.  The only saving grace was that you had a real good security guard watching the line and doing head counts to make sure there was a cutoff point- give the guy a raise.  Make a system that should be in and out for everybody.  Next put the $50 seats ON THE MAIN FLOOR.  We don't care that they are folding chairs and not the plush chairs at the back of the theater on the 3rd floor.  Give the PAYING CUSTOMER the unobstructed view of the TV screen, closer access to food, beer, and bar drinks, and gaming tables.  You, Hard Rock Management, were bass ackwards in putting paying customers in the back of the theater and giving the Free customers the best seats and location in the house.  Somebody should be reprimanded and you can use that list of driver's licenses you took down to mail us all free VIP tickets to the 2013 Superbowl Party and a discounted stay at the Hard Rock.  That's how you make things right.  I'd hope you get your act together for 2013.

I made our reservation directly with the hotel more than 2 months ahead of our stay and requested a wheelchair accessible room with a Roll in Shower. I was told that wouldn't be a problem and booked the Pool View room.

We arrived, breezed through Check-in and went to our room. Here is when the problem reared its ugly head. The room was Wheelchair Accessible, but had a Tub with Bars, not a Roll in. To a person with a disability, this is a major difference. I called the front desk and they changed our room. Guess what...Room number two wasn't even accessible. Another call...this time a Manager took charge, apologized and promised us we would like our new room.  Room Number Three was actually a Suite in the HRH Towers.

This room was perfect! A Beautiful view, great bed and huge bathroom with a well designed Roll in Shower made our stay very comfortable and relaxing. The HRH tower staff treated us like royalty and was extremely helpful when I lost my ID just before we were leaving. If I could give a separate review for the HRH Towers, it would definitely be 5 Stars.

I actually appreciate something about the Hard Rock that most Yelpers seemed to view as a negative. I like the smaller, less crowded Casino. It makes it much easier for me to actually play comfortably. If I want hustle and bustle, I can always go to The Strip!  The selection of restaurants is varied, but the quality could be better.

The hotel is located about a half mile off of the southern part of the main strip.  It's definitely in walking distance though the area in between the two can seem a little dodgy at night. A cab costs about $10. Beware of the $3 surcharge if you pay with card. There is a bus which will take you directly from the hotel to the mall at the northern part of the strip. Ask about the schedule and make sure to get there early as seats fill up quickly. 

The front desk is right off of the casino,  in the main area of the building. Everyone was very friendly and helped us get situated quickly and offered up several recommendations for food and things to do. 

There are several wings with rooms located throughout the building. The rooms were very large,  comfortable and the restrooms were  nice.  Beware of the mini bar and other items for sale.  If you pick one up and put it back down you're automatically charged. The CVS accross the street has everything you could need (including liquor) for far less. 

Housekeeping was great and kept everything very clean and tidy. 

The building has a few restaurants,  none of which are excellent,  but all of which will do if you need a quick bite.  I especially recommend that margaritas at pink tacos.  There are also a few shops including two coffee spots (with surprisingly good espresso)  and a tattoo parrot. 

The casino itself leaves something to be envied.  While it has all of the games and tables found at all casinos,  the floor is small and the dealers aren't always the friendliest.

This is a smoking location,  however they have a great ventilation system so we didn't notice it and our clothes didn't smell.  Our room was non-smoking and didn't smell either.",18,3,4

They room was nice and big, but not all the lights worked, and the ones in the bathroom are those energy-saver bulbs that take five minutes to illuminate.  Non-working bulbs aside, the room was still a bit too dark for my liking.  The decor was minimalist modern, which looks cool, but isn't all that practical or to my taste.

The hotel and casino has some good casual restaurants in Johnny Smalls, Mr. Lucky's, and Pink Taco, all of which we ate at.  We also went to parties at Vanity and Body English, which aren't my thing but they were cool to check out, even if a light beer will set you back $9.  The location is a bit of a pain as it is a real hike to\/from the strip and a $10-$15 cab if you don't want to hoof it.

TIP: Avoid the ridiculous mini-bar prices.  Go across the street to CVS and buy yourself some snacks and bottled water.  And they sell beer and liquor too!

We went to Hair Wars this past weekend and stayed at the Hard Rock.  The bed was DIVINE!  I rarely get a good night's sleep at a hotel.

And then...trumpets and drum roll, please...the bed!  Sunk right in.  Firm but not hard pillows.  The comforter...well, I almost took it home with me!
The bathtub was HUGE.  I would have invited a special guest to share the bath experience with me, but I was there with my boss and Jenni from work.  
OMG the funniest thing?  Two little cans of AXE on the sink.  What is this, Scottsdale douche?  Ha!
Everyone working there was friendly (probably because we were the only non-drunk-obnoxious people in the place.)
I would definitely stay here again.

There is a free shuttle that goes to the strip, but it comes every hour only until 5pm, and whats more, the silly Escalade they use only seats 8 people, and there are tons of people wanting to take the shuttle. Once 8 folks are seated, the shuttle takes off and everyone else has to wait another hour. Me and my bf spent a CHUNK of money on cab rides during our trip. Besides this fact, I liked the hotel.

We checked in and I requested a casino room which faced the pool and was told that they would have one for me however it wouldn't be available till later that afternoon. so when I got the text saying the room was ready I checked in (officially) and was given my room key and told I was in PARADISE TOWER. So when I reminded them I wanted a casino tower the lady helping me stated that they didn't have any rooms available in the casino tower facing the pool, so I requested my original room which was casino tower mountain view and was told they didn't have any rooms available in casino tower. at this time I was offered an UPGRADE. (I was excited because I was upgraded) I signed my papers and went to my room which was a DELUXE Casino tower room...nothing major except it had a living room, not even a mini bar or a coffee maker in the room:-(
So 3 days later I check out and I'm told I was charged $50 extra a night for the UPGRADE. I requested to speak to the manager who came up and I explained the situation and she said ""I have your signature on file so you were told you were getting an upgrade"". And I explained and agreed that yes i was told I was being UPGRADED but not told I would be paying for it. She began to patronize me by telling me that she understood but that she would not be able to change anything. So I again reminded her that it wasn't explained to me that I would have to pay for their lack of communication. 
To say I was utterly disappointed in her ability to not make it right is an understatement. I wasn't expecting her to COMP the entire room however I was expecting her to do something and don't patronize me!!!! This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

I guess they got manageable after a couple rounds of drinks. We had a voucher for a cabana, and it said to reserve it, and it actually is first come first served. Kind of dumb to give out a voucher where it clearly states to have a reservation and then when you call to make it, they say to just come down and hopefully one is open.

HRH is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. As a music\/history nut, all the history on display throughout the hotel is AMAZING to look at but it is quickly dwarfed by the clientele and room quality. 

We booked a room through Hotel Tonight. Although it saved us some bucks, I still think the price we paid was too much considering the overall quality of the hotel. We stayed in the Casino Tower which is in definite need of some upgrades. The halls are pretty dingy and the doors\/walls are scuffed. The room itself seemed to have paper thin walls and we had the pleasure of being next door to a girls weekend so we got to hear loud voices and loud music all night. At one point, it sounded like our sink was over flowing and was making some crazy weird gurgling noises. Thankfully it wasn't but at 3am it was not pleasant to wake up to and panic about. And one other minor but irritating detail was that the door that connected our room to the other did not touch the ground so a consistent glowing light was shining through the bottom from the other room.

We ate at FU which was good but VERY empty for a Saturday night. I think we had the entire wait staff taking care of us because of their lack of customers haha. But hey, we will take it! 

The casino floor itself is pretty small as it goes for Vegas hotels. The overall energy of the hotel just did not FEEL like Vegas on a Saturday which was kind of a bummer. We did enjoy some people watching but it all just seemed kind of dreary and since the strip is too far away to walk and traffic on Sat can be crazy, we opted to just go back to the room. 

I think if you are looking for a place to pre-party and or just go to the pool and then be beyond tired so you can sleep through anything, this is the joint for you, but if you are one to enjoy the luxuries that a nice hotel can offer, I'd keep looking :)",4,2,2

We stayed in the Paradise Tower - rooms were fairly average, two double beds, flat screen tv, mini bar, bathroom with his & her sinks, shower (no tub).  My main complaint with the room was that the AC was definitely not functioning at its best.  Our room overlooked the main pool, and it just so happens that the Rehab party was going on the day we checked in.  We were considering going.....until we got to watch from our room all the shenanigans that were taking place down below.  This was entertainment at it's very finest folks.  Yup, there were people doin it in the pool, and not very discretely either!  When we stopped back to our room in the late afternoon it was a complete and utter shit show down there!  The water was straight up murky, filled with beer, urine, and God only knows what else.  No thank you.  Fortunately there are a few other pools- one other large pool area, another smaller more posh pool area that basically just had cabanas and no loungers, and then a tiny roof top pool.  At first I didn't like the sand at the pool because I thought it made the water look dirty, but it grew on me, and there is an area without sand as well.  Loved that there were cheap eats offered at the pool area, didn't love the dude that searched my bag upon entering the area because he had to ""check for drugs"".  Back off buddy.  We ate at both Pink Taco and Mr. Lucky's while we stayed here and had great food at both, and it was nice that these restaurants were more reasonably priced than the restaurants at most of the other casinos.  The gaming area here is kind of small, but no big deal.  This hotel is located just off the strip- a very short, and cheap cab ride.  Not sure if I'll ever be back in Vegas, but if I were I probably wouldn't stay here again- I'd rather go for a shorter amount of time and stay at a nicer place.

The room itself was really nice. Paradise tower, two queen beds and a pretty view of Rehab and the strip. The beds were soft and comfortable.

A friend of my brother's did stay here and rented a bungalow for the afternoon. Normally the going rate is around $1000, but I think our group ended up paying half that much. Who says there aren't bright spots in a recession? The fee comes with a certain food and drink allotment. We were served sliders, fish tacos, and mini-quesadillas by a woman wearing some sort of purple harem costume. She also brought fresh juices for mixers. As I was drinking and gambling the night before and had skipped breakfast, the screwdriver and finger-food combination was remedial.

The bungalows overlook the pool area - which resembles the set of Fantasy Island if Fantasy Island was a music video from 1987 instead of a TV show from 1978. It wasn't particularly hot or sunny that afternoon, but it was Spring Break, so girls in bikinis were sunning themselves, while a few meathead types went shirtless to prove that they did, in fact, spend the winter wailing on their pecs. If this sounds a bit like a page from Maxim magazine, you're not far off. They were actually shooting photos for their ""Hometown Hotties"" feature. Predictably, this brought out quite a few women who wear bikinis at night (if you know what I mean, and I think you do). There's not much more to say about that.

So let's discuss the poker room, shall we? It's nicely appointed, with a lot of leather and dark wood, sort of like a boy's version of a medieval fortress if the boy had an interior designer for an uncle. It was also largely empty while I was there. A morning tournament was finishing on one table, while one limit and one no-limit game were the only ones available. The action was fairly friendly, though beginners would be advised to try a limit game before playing a no-limit game, even with a small buy-in. If you don't know what those words mean, you shouldn't sit down at a poker table in the first place (unless I'm already sitting at the table. In that case, why not give it a try?) Players are rated by the hour for comps. It's the same card that you can use at the tables or slots.

Speaking of tables, the Hard Rock does have craps and blackjack, plus other crummier table games for those who don't like blackjack and plenty of slots for those who don't know any better. Dealers at the table games were friendlier than the poker dealers. The poker dealers seemed to be focused on (1) speed - which equals profit for the casino, and (2) cold-decking me, with one glorious exception that took me from way down to about even.

The crowd was younger than most Strip casinos, though not as stylish as the crowd at the Palms. It might have been one of the youngest crowds in Vegas though. They also have a music venue that regularly books national touring acts.",0,0,0

The rooms are super clean (I've never had a problem), the pillows and beds are SOOOO comfy and soft and they just expanded so the casino is even bigger and has more variety now too.

One thing I will say is that don't open the wrong shampoo bottle! I wasn't feeling too well the next morning one time and went to shower and opened a slightly larger shampoo bottle. They charged me $50 for it! Yuck! But I guess its my fault since I didn't see the paper on it marked ""You will be charged $50 if you use this shampoo"".

I could be a little biased seeing as though I know 2 VIP hosts there and they ALWAYS hook me up when I stay here. No long lines at Rehab, table hopping at the clubs and no cover, free steak dinners at Rare 120, I could go on and on.

This was the worst stay of my life, I literally cried in front of the manager from all the crap that was happening to us there. 

First, we wanted to extend our stay so we asked the front desk lady named LaLa if we can add on the second day on my boyfriends credit card without any extra charges and she said it was fine. And she was doing her thing and then she got quiet and said ""uh oh...mmm let me fix this"" and she continued to do what she was doing and at the end she said ""you know what I should of just charged everything at the end. You guys are fine. So we left and kept getting phone calls to our room that our cards got declined. They called 3 times and every time I went down they said it was fine but kept calling. Finally, someone figured it out and said that upon using a second credit card, it released all the funds from the original card and put it on the second. It got declined because the second credit card didn't have a high credit limit and then they tried to put everything back on the second credit card and it didn't work because it looked like they tried to double charge and my card has protection against that and declined it as well. In the end they made me use a third credit card and apologized and it was stupid because I took that credit card out specifically for that vacation since it had 0 apr for 18 months. So now we had to pay $1000 within the billing cycle which was super inconvenient.

Second, our toilet was making weird noises so we called maintenance he took literally 30 minutes to come and He simply flushed twice and said it was fine so we left to get some Popeyes and came back to a freaking lake. Literally, people came and stepped on the carpet next to the bed and water would splash up. It was disgusting. And they offered a room change and no one helped us move our stuff. We were so pissed we went back down and they upgraded us to a suit. 

Third, they said they were going to give us discounts but we never got them so I had to call corporate because every time I called the front desk they were rude and told me that the charges are fine. This all happened January 2, 2017 and as of today January 30, 2017 my issues haven't been resolved and all I keep getting back are emails saying sorry for the delay they don't know what's taking so long.


Update: It is March 1st 2017, they have resolved all our problems except a refund that was supposed to be given as compensation for the damaged items. The guy I talk to named David was a dick and made it sound like we did something to the toilet to make it flow, he said ""you know toilets just don't do that so I'm having a hard time understanding what happens"". I called him like 4 times and he never answers and I leave voicemails. He told me to call him February 15 if he hadn't called me to tell me that the check was being sent to me and of course he didn't call so I called him on the 17th and no answer and as of today still no call from him.",6,1,1

Hard Rock came through in that respect but this is no Bellagio or Venetian so make sure you understand your true needs before deciding on Hard Rock.  Unfortunately, we were early (it was March) and Rehab was still over a month away but there's always a next time.

As for Hard Rock Hotel, I'll lay down my pros and cons in point form:

Pros:
- Checked in and spoke to a ""Heather"". Her smile & attitude were a great way to begin the Vegas getaway.  She was courteous and offered her assistance if I had any questions regarding the Hard Rock scene or Vegas nightlife.
- I had no issues with the room itself.  Comfy beds for those long, extremely drunk nights\/mornings.  If I can recall, there were 4-5 pillows per bed.  Having an ORGY with 4-5 pillows at 8am in the morning is SOOO worth it! Especially after a night of drinking or an after hours joint like Drai's.
- Had a poolside view and just like I was told, there was construction going on to extend the pool.  By the looks of it, REHAB is going to be even bigger!  To be honest, I wasn't annoyed by the noise when I was sleeping (didn't hear much) but I'll have to blame that on the long nights we had. 
- The vibe? Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings were ""poppin"" at the Center Bar and gambling tables.  Not to mention,  music and pussycat doll themed dancers on stripper poles.  As for other Hard Rock patrons staying at the hotel, there are some or many great looking people to meet and talked to.
- Body English on Sundays!
- Starbucks...if you're a fan.
- I had no issues with the food quality from certain restaurants (ie. Mr. Lucky's & Pink Taco).  Nice to have a 24\/7 restaurant like Mr. Lucky's right in your hotel. That way you don't have to venture out looking for one. Pricey but let's be realistic, this is Vegas people.

Cons:
- At this point in time, ongoing construction.
- It would be nice if the Hard Rock staff would check all hallways at closer intervals and take away food trays by doors, etc. 

No matter what age, if you're in your 20s, 30s or 40s, if your ""mindset"" is to party and be around a young party type crowd, HRH should do just fine.",1,1,1

I've stayed here twice so far, and sure to keep coming back. 

The first time was when my boyfriend and I ditched work during the week and drove up for a few days. You can always find cheap rooms on a Wednesday-Friday, but we had never stayed here so we gave it a shot. $40 a night for a king bed and a view? Hell yes! The room was gorgeous! Not sure if it's because its exactly my taste, but the dark furniture and custom walls with rockstar photos was just awesome. 
We are not club people, so being off the strip was not a big deal. I actually like that its off the strip because we like to go visit locals only places and avoid all the traffic of LV blvd.

Our second visit was when we went to see the Queens of the Stoneage. Two VIP tickets and a room for only $110 total?? That was insane! (tickets alone would have been $100 on ticketmaster). When we checked in the guy accidently charged my boyfriend for an extra ticket. He credited the card right away.

We checked in at 11pm and were told there were no king beds available. My husband is 6'11, a king bed is not just a preference but a necessity. He is over a foot taller than a queen bed. The woman helping us was rude\/ cold and said try again tomorrow. When we called the next day (3 times before anyone answered), they said try after 3. We did get a king bed that day but I was unimpressed with the customer service. 

The room was nice, some people complained about how dark it was but that didn't bother me much. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the shower was huge, easily accommodating two ; ). 

The food was not so good- Pink Taco was incredibly overrated, room service was outrageously expensive and included a delivery fee plus 21% gratuity regardless of what you ordered. 

Personally I liked that the hotel was off the strip. The strip was nuts and I liked the bit of separation. We had a rental car and to park there is easy and free. 

Gaming- the casino is small and unimpressive. I am a big gambler so was looking for more than this. It helped me control myself a bit though because if I wanted to gamble I had to leave so I didn't spend as much. 

The pool area is amazing. I couldn't get enough of this pool area, it is stunning. 

The resort fees are annoying. $24\/day and all we used was the wifi, when it worked. Everywhere has stupid resort fees these days so there isn't much to do, but worth noting.

Food SUCKED! They burnt my pancakes and the eggs were NOT over medium as I ordered. The juice was gross, left a bad taste in my mouth. The waitress barely came by to see if i needed anything, like maybe some water to wash out the juice.
Anyway... We ate and went back to the pool and the guy said we needed our wristbands which I lost the day before but was told to just ask the concierge and they would replace them.
NOPE! They wanted to charge me $25 for wristbands to get into their stupid pool!!! Yes i drove all the way from LA to pay $25 for your stupid pool after I already paid for the room. COME ON!

This is a really nice hotel, but be mindful of what type of person stays here.  If you want to relax and have some peace and quiet DON'T go here.  Hard Rock is Trendy and Hipster, basically a very nicely decorated hotel for the young.

Ive been here a few times and stayed here once.  The Hotel is great, especially if you are a hardcore Rock fan.  The decor and artifacts will keep you distracted, which has led into many-a-collision on the floor (Sorry Lady).

The rooms are great.  Maybe its what went on in that room that had me mesmerized... Whatever it is, I loved it.  The bed was comfortable and we had a little balcony.  Granted the view was of the air conditioning vent below but that's anywhere in Vegas.  Also, there was just enough furniture to not overcrowd the room.

We checked into the ""suite"" only to find dirty and stained duvets, which leads me to believe cleanliness is not important. We have no coffee maker, no refrigerator, and half stalked, probably over priced, junk items in the ""kitchen"". Our beautiful room that we paid good money for over looks the parking garage and airport.

We stayed there because it was headquarters for an international rugby tournament we attended (which was great!!).  With that said I expected better service and amenities from a 4 star hotel..

I knew it was a bad omen when we arrived Thursday afternoon at 4pm and the 2 doormen (dressed in rock star black of course) carried on a personal conversation and completely ignored us..  A hotel guest saw me hauling my suitcase and opened the door for me, I should have tipped him!

We asked for a quiet room, they put us on the 18th floor of Paradise Tower (supposedly an upgrade).  At  1am we woke up to music coming up from the nightclub adjacent to the pool area (which was some distance from our room).   We were told the music would end at 4:30am, so we changed rooms at 1:30am.   Poolside rooms are great if you plan to stay up until 5am partying, otherwise ask for mountain side (a euphemism for parking lot side).  Call us old farts but we like our sleep.  

The aura of the place is rock star sleazy;  pole dancers, a tattoo parlor (with  customers on display while being tattooed!) , rock music blaring 24\/7, shops with names like 'Love Jones' and 'Affliction'.   Everything is black and grey including the bedroom furniture, the bathroom vanity, the carpets and the employees' attire.     

HRH requires a damage deposit upon check in, that says something about the clientele.  This is not a hotel for grownups.   Case in point, on two different occasions, we saw 'guests' pushing SHOPPING CARTS full of liquor  (presumably from the CVS across the street)   through the front  lobby....VERY CLASSY.  party on!!   The doormen really have things under control.     You won't see that at the Four Seasons, hell I did not even see that at the Quality Inn in Albany NY!  

Also  there is a $7+  daily 'resort'' fee, not sure what that covers as there is a fee to use the health club and workout room (which was free at the Quality Inn in Albany NY!),  The HRH is surrounded by asphalt and vacant lots waiting for the recession to end.   So it is a mystery what the 'resort' fee covered just another example of how the HRH squeezes every penny out of their guests.

The room was OK,  no coffee maker,  dim lighting (but who goes to the HRH to read?) , nighstand on only one side of the bed.   The  linens were nice, bed was comfy, housekeeping very good (God bless, them those women must work very hard with that crowd)..    Upon check out I wanted  a copy of my bill, the front desk was staffed by 2 people with 12 guests waiting, it was worse later on Sunday afternoon.   On Thursday, with no guests waiting, there were four staff members at the  front desk.  

PROS:  
- The  rock star memorabilia on display in the public areas is very cool.
- Surprisingly there were no parties or loud guests near our room.
- Gary the bellman who moved us at 1:30am was great, also another bellman who went out of his way to assist us was very good.
- There is a new casino area with no rock music  if you like to hear yourself think while losing your money.

BOTTOM LINE
- I would rather be in a hotel on the strip that caters to grownups, or if I had to stay in that area I would stay at the Hyatt Place across the street from HRH for half the price (AAA  weekend rate is  $90 with breakfast)..
- However if you are 20 something,  love late nights, loud music. hotties, and don't  mind paying $20+ round trip taxi  to the strip then the HRH is for you.",1,0,1

It was nice when we arrived. The front desk was very nice and the room was better than expected. But that's when it got bad. We stayed two nights for my friends bachelor party. So as you would expect, we would sleep in until about noon. Housekeeping entered our room both days without knocking and began servicing our room without even asking. After our room was serviced, we went to the strip during the day. We come back and our keys don't work. Security let us in. When we finally got into our room, I noticed my bag was open and items were not where I had left them. $250 cash and my Oakley sunglasses case were missing. I called security to report it and they were very friendly and apologetic. I filled out a report with them and was told I would be contacted within 48 hours.

By the time the report was filed and I got back to the room, my new key that front desk had just made for me, did not work. Called the front desk who sent an engineer to look at the door. The engineer was friendly and said it was an issue with the keys, not the door. We went back downstairs to the front desk to get another set of keys. These keys finally worked. By this time, it was 10:30pm and the line to the club we were going to was very long. The staff for the club said it would take at least two hours to get in from where we were in line. We had planned on being in line at 9pm, but because of the circumstances above, we were not able to do so.

Our plan to go to the club was ruined and we ended up walking the strip back to the hotel as all the other clubs were just as busy. So the bachelor missed out on the club he wanted to go to.

At checkout the next day, I mentioned the stolen money to the concierge agent. There was no apology. She just said risk management would get back to me in 48 hours.

We checked out Sunday and the money was reported missing on Saturday. I had not received any call by Tuesday, so I left a message with risk management Tuesday night. I did not receive a call by 3:30pm Wednesday so I called and left another message. They called me back at 4:30pm Wednesday to tell me it was a busy weekend and they hadn't started the investigation of my stolen money yet and would call me back when the investigation was completed. And she wanted to make it clear that the hotel is not responsible for any stolen belongings unless they are in the room safe.

So five days after my money and sunglasses case were stolen from my closed bag, I have no answers. It seems the hotel allows their employees to go into guest's bags and take anything they want.",5,0,1

We were given three options: wait until our King non smoking room was ready (which the lady at the front said would be at least a half hour, and that was being generous), pay to upgrade to a King suite (which I read on reviews aren't much different here-disappointing), or take a double ""queen"" room that was available. I thought checkin was at 3? If you can't guarantee rooms by the time you ask people to check in- put a later check in time. For this alone I would suggest another hotel that's closer to the strip and would upgrade you for free because it was THEIR mistake your room wasn't ready!!!

After scoring their twitter deal for $20 a night, YES $20 A NIGHT for Thursday-Sunday I couldnt be a happier man. I mean, where in the world can you stay for $20 a night that's not infested w\/ bed bugs and other things that you do not want to see in a room.

I arrived Thursday afternoon and the check in line was pretty long. I was pretty annoyed cause I had a group already at Liquid ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/liquid-pool-lounge-las-vegas#hrid:IWnxB2V_2xWqhTArydmhJw\/src:self ) waiting for me!
Overall it took 20min to get checked in. I booked the twitter deal like mentioned before and told myself, what the heck, lets try the $20 trick and see what I can do.  Next thing you know, upgraded to high floor w\/ pool view! Always do the $20 trick, 95% of the time you'll get an upgrade if available. 

The room was spacious, clean and had a nice decor w\/ the white sheets and dark walls. The patio door opened up to a nice view of the HRH Pool which hosts Rehabx on the weekends. The only gripe about the room was there was only two shower towels which would be a problem with more people in the room but it didnt affect me since I was solo.

The hotel itself is a smaller hotel but at the same time, you get the Vegas feel.  Only gripe is the lack of food on the property with the exception of Mr. Luckys 24\/7 and Pink Taco.

This hotel attracts the party people. If your looking for a quiet time , dont come here. The clientele that comes here is looking for a good time. Dont be surprised with drunken shenanigans in the hallways at 5am.

Currently there are management issues at HRH with the nightlife scene being taken over by AMG. Expect changes to the nightlife and Rehab now that they are in control. Who knows what the future brings.

Wonderful customer service. When we got to the hotel at 4am they allowed us to check in early and even gave us a free room upgrade. We went from a regular room to a king suite. OMG! THANK YOU! 

The suite is huge! Has a mini bar area full with its own sink, a living room area with l-shape couch, king sized bed, and HUGE HUGE bathroom. There was a 2 person shower and a 2 person bathtub. Wow! The room was equipped with 2 LCD 42"" tvs, ipod wall dock which plays music in the whole suite, and an ipod dock clock. 

Usually I have a little trouble sleeping the first night in a hotel because I'm not used to the bed, but the bed here was so fluffy that I fell right to sleep. 

You should get the players card to their casino so you can get deals on the food. You also get a free $15 to play when you first sign up.

I'll have to use the flashlight on my iPhone somehow.  Everything is black and red and gray, but the towels are typical hotel white.  The clash is actually comical.
On a brighter note, the bed is so very comfortable with wonderful fluffy pillows.

I'm back to edit this review because I need to tell you about the Pool.  The pool situation increases the creepiness factor of this hotel by about a hundred percent. 
Here we go, I'll try to keep this short.
First attempt: my husband and I tried to get to the pool through a row of glass doors near our elevator bank.  Security stopped us and told us we couldn't enter this way.  He gave us directions for finding the entrance, turns out you have to go through the parking garage (ugly).  We finally find it and are told by more security guards that we can't bring our backpack which has our books and sunscreen and water and other harmless stuff.  Back to Dracula's lair (our room) unpack the backpack, take what we need, head back down. This time we find out we need our ID's to prove we are 21.  We're both in our 40's.  So, back up to the depressing cave of a room, get our ID's and back down through the ugly garage.  Here comes the fun part, after make it through the door after showing ID, we both get pat downs like we've never had in our lives, not at airports or concerts, not ever.  I basically was given a breast exam.  You would have thought we were going to visit someone in prison.
Here's what we found when we cleared security, pool #1 was overcrowded loud and obnoxious.  Pool #2 was less loud but just as overcrowded, not a lounge chair to be had. Pools #3 and #4 were CLOSED!
We took a quick unsatisfying swim, towelled off and went back to our evil, depressing room.  Then we made it up to ourselves by visiting other awesome hotels and spending time and money there instead.",14,9,3

As the bride I was very excited to see the show! Starting out we bought 10 total tickets to the show for bridesmaids. As the date approached some girls had to drop out for various reasons. So when we arrived in Vegas we only had 7 girls with us. My maid of honor called Ticketmaster about resealing tickets  we were told that we were allowed to resale so we posted the three tickets on Vivid seats. Two tickets were purchased the day before the show. 

Fast forward to the night before the show and we go to the box office and get our tickets printed. We were told that we weren't allowed to resale tickets and the two girls that purchased are tickets would not get it in! We were very upset and felt bad. We begged the lady at the box office to please let them in when they got there. She wasn't very nice to us and said it's not her problem and she's not responsible for the other girls getting in. She took us to a manager. He offered to take the two tickets and promised to let the girls in. 


Fast forward to today: my maid of honor gets a call from vivid seats stating that the girls who bought the tickets were not allowed in and that we would be charged a fee for trying to sale fraudulent tickets! We are shocked that we were told the girls would be allowed in. We feel lied to and just feel disgusted by the Magic Mike\/Hard rock Hotel box office workers and management. They really put a bad taste in my mouth and ruined my bachelorette party. This needs to be made right with us as we have many connections to Vegas and will not be sending business their way.

First, the check-in area is so much easier (no lines) and nicer than the other check-in area. Second, it's a whole suite - separate wet bar, living room with wrap around couch, sleeping area, and a bathroom big enough to play baseball in... cuz I just wanna be a big rock star. Okay, cheesy reference... but, you know that no matter how much you hate on Nickelback, ya'll have sung along to SOME part of this song. Anyway, our suite wasn't in the Nickelback theme... we had the Johnny Rotten room. The partial wall that divides the living from bedroom has a flat screen on either side, so you don't have to fight over what to watch. And there's a sound system on the wall where you can choose mood music by genre or just hook up your own ipod and play your own show tunes... nice touch.

Even though we reserved a King bed, we got two Queen beds... but, we made use of both. One can really put on a show in the bathroom, as it's only divided by the bedroom with a wall of glass. But, there is a large curtain that can be pulled closed- but what's the fun in that? I love that the shower and bathtub are separate, and both are big enough to fit 10 plus me (sorry). Seriously the bathroom, bedroom, and living room are all about the same size.

 It seemed as though what actually happened is that when I went to check out they revoked the discount they gave to all pole expo attendees and took it out of my deposit.

Very nice place, I'm happy I can now say I've been there. But I have experienced better.

Bar:
Fresh off a flight from Detroit I arrive at the HRH around midnight. I'm greeted with a drink (Vodka & Monster) and plenty of handshakes from  a large group of fellow co-workers and friends. The drink was horrible, thinking maybe somebody was being cute and tainted my drink with a complimentary Vegas party favor I ordered another. Tasted equally as shitty. that was last drink I paid for there. 

HOTEL:
The room was awesome, great view from the Casino Tower facing North. You could see the pools below, and the northern end of the strip. Beverages that came in the fridge were a little over priced... but thats Vegas for ya.

CASINO:
Every dollar I won on the strip I lost here at Hard Rock. I've never seen dealers pull the hands they were pulling. Nice big spread out floor, managed well. During the week it was down to only a few open tables. The weekend is when the place was rocking though! every table filled, mass groups of people checking in, checking out, coming and going from the concerts, and the line outside the club in there was crazy. 

POOL: We all went to the Paradise Beach North pool. Took a while for us to get organized in finding what we wanted. Place was busy and all of the good cabanas were taken (before 11am). Cabanas were expensive and the only ones available were away from the pool (away from the action). We finally found what was an oversized ottoman we rented for $500+ for the day. Drinks (Vodka & Monster) were around $36 a piece. The pool was frigid, but entertaining. Some of the most beautiful women in the world sun bathing. But there were some of the world's ""people that shouldn't be in a bikini"" there as well. All together we blew thousands there in drinks and from renting the ottoman\/ couch.

Pros: Cool costumes worn by famous people, pools are awesome and bed are very comfortable. Make sure you stop and buy drinks, I bought a bottle of water in the room for $9.00. No bratty kids running around, well, actually you had drunk, loud, and rowdy young people running around. There was always some kind of drama in the elevator or in the hallways. 

Cons: Room was kind of dirty, even after housekeeping came in, they didn't do a very good job with cleaning. They might have had a toiletry shortage because we only got them the first night. Restaurants were very pricey. I hated the lighting in the room, the only normal light was in the washroom minus toilet room. I didn't like how the doors to the washroom were clear. The only privacy you have is in the tiny toilet room and it was moldy and dark. The  last day of our stay, housekeeping came in at 9:00 a.m., she knocked lightly and I was in the shower, keep in mind that those doors are clear.

The furniture was kind of like ikea quality, which is not a big deal for me, but the bathroom was looking rough, just kind of like maintenance was not a priority. The walls were painted white but had foot prints on them, like someone had been kicking the wall.

The room was a good size and the beds were super comfortable, but unless you are in your early 20's I wouldn't recommend this hotel. You could hear drunk people running down the hall and acting crazy at all times.

The actual casino was nice and not as crowded and trashy as other casinos, in fact since there are not as many people there, is much easier to gamble and get drinks from the waitresses. 

Parking was never a problem and I never had any issues with anyone from the staff.

On the night of 3 May 2013 C.E., the Hard Rock Hotel and its criminally poor planning lead to a near perfect storm of mayhem in their parking garages, specifically the Harmon structure. 

Too many events, not enough parking. 

--But, Edwin P. Why are you such a whiny complainer? Did you now know this beforehand? Don't you follow HRH on Twitter and did they not announce publicly that there will be very limited parking like the Cosmo does?-- 

No, no, no, and don't call me a complainer. 

No over*flow parking, no employee(s) or basic signage informing individuals attempting to park that there was no parking and to enter the garage, on Harmon, would lead to well over an hour of wasting your petro and brain cells as you inhaled all of the exhaust of other vehicles with patrons, or potential patrons, who are just trying to park their vehicles so they can use their concert tickets to listen to some damn live music.

We live in a fairly complex world. Source: http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/david_christian_big_history.html. But it is one thing to replicate DNA and another thing to arrange enough parking for your patrons on any given night.

Do they know beforehand how many tickets they have sold? Yes. 
Do they know beforehand how many parking stalls they possess? Yes. 
Do they know beforehand how to mitigate for what occurred on 3 May? Apparently not -- they don't know, don't care or both. I say both. 

A property that does not know how to plan for the safe arrival, stay, and exit of patrons or potential patrons should not be licensed to host and promote events. Moreover, whoever was in charge on this night should be summarily terminated for cause.

-- But Edwin P. As a local you should not even be going to the strip. You should expect this type of blatant buffoonery. I avoid the strip because of experiences like this.--

Don't talk to me.

Epilogue: I ended up parking at UNLV. It is actually closer than it sounds. My girlfriend got to hear Paramore's set (The Joint), I was able to walk off my frustrations a bit, and we both got to hear Newsted (Vinyl). I did not have tickets to Chevelle.  - E

For starters, this hotel is NOT accommodating to medical issues. I expressed to the reservations desk that I have a food allergy which necessitated me to bring all of my food for our week-long vacation. When asked, they explained to me that there are no refrigerators in the room, but one could be provided for $20 a day. Absurd. I even offered to provide a note from my doctor confirming my very serious food allergy (so they didn't think I was making this up just to have a fridge), and she was very rude and would not help me.
The room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. But taking into consideration that there is no refrigerator, microwave, or coffee pot in the room, it was way too pricey.
Our room keys failed three times, and we kept having to get them remade over and over.
The pools are very nice. But the music from the DJ is so loud that I could barely talk to my husband. It would be nice to have at least one day a week, or a portion of the day where there isn't relentless party music. I thought the pools would be relaxing, but it was annoying, and the music was the same.... it was the same songs on the same loop every day.
Also, considering that I am staying at the hotel, I should not have to pay $50 a day to use the pool on the weekends because of the Rehab pool party.

Folks, this is not a place for families or for the family reunion with your grandma, unless she wants drunken frat boys running down the halls hollering 
at her.

Resort design - 4.5 stars.  The decor is very modern and subdued, and the common areas surprisingly did not completely reek of cigarette smoke.  I spent a good amount of time just wandering down the halls checking out all of their music memorabilia.

I love the casino layout.  There's a mini pit in the middle of the circular room that you enter through, and the rest of the casino off to the side on the opposite side of the hotel towers.  This is the first Vegas resort I've been to where I didn't have to walk through a casino to get to my hotel room.  Noice.  Minus have a star because they blast music from the pool area from 11-6, making it difficult to nap in your room if it faces the pool area (ours did, and it was loud even on the 16th floor).

Restaurants and bars - 3 stars.  I patronized Mr. Lucky's 24\/7, Espumoso, and the Hard Rock Café adjacent to the resort, and was satisfied with all of them.  But I was kind of surprised there weren't more bars (just the casino bar) and there's no buffet!  What the heck is a Vegas resort without a buffet to gorge myself with?

Pool - 3.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong, the pools are the best I've seen in Vegas- - they have about 5 different pools in their resort area, complete with waterfalls, sandy beaches, a dance area, infinity pools, and lounge chairs in the water.  But actually going to the pool is a complete pain in the ass.  The security is crazy - - they did a complete bag search and you can't even bring in water.  In fact, you can't walk in any of the outside areas with any food or drink on your person.  I have not yet experienced this, even at Mandalay Bay.  And 90% of the chairs available have a $100 food and drink minimum.  So annoying.  But I was able to figure out the system by Sunday and nabbed some seats in the non-Rehab pool.",3,1,0

Our first visit we stayed in the HRH Tower.  It was beautifully decorated, the view was great over the pool.  A little loud during the day with the pool music, so a little hard to take a nap.  But overall a very great location.  The second visit we stayed in The Paradise Tower.  We had a corner room with views that could not be beat.  Amazing.   The walk was a bit longer to the casino floor and the crowd on this side seemed a tad rougher.  We will book The HRH Tower for our next visit.
The bartenders were incredible.  Phillip and Nick our all time favs.  Most everyone we came in contact with were very nice.  The center bar has a very trippy echo that stumped us the first couple days, but then figured out how to enjoy someone's conversation from the other side of the bar.  Pretty funny.
Security in this hotel always seems to be comforting.  Nice work HR.
You can definitely see some wear and tear in the hotel, but over all a very nice stay.  
The pole dancers over the gaming tables are rad.  A show while you are gambling.  Those dancers were so strong and fun to watch.
The dealers are really nice as well.  Most all wanted you to win and are more than happy to help and chat.  We played BJ and craps most everyday.  The pit bosses were very friendly.
Check-in and out is super easy and welcoming.
We have rented a cabana at the nirvana pool twice.  A great way to spend a day if the weather is nice.
I will rate the restaurants separately, but just need to mention that we have eaten at all establishments.  Culinary Drop out we visited multiple times.  It was that good and fun.
And finally, one observation we made is how nice looking most people are in the casino.  There seemed to be a steady stream of 25-60 year old.  This hotel is not filled with old people or families with kids.  A perfect spot of the 40-something.  We will most definitely be back.  Thanks for the fun.",0,0,0

She then tossed the credit card and ID on the counter and said in a very rude tone that check out was not later than 11, no exceptions.

The view from our room of the strip and the pools was quite wonderful. The service was great - very accommodating. They were helpful and quick to provide us with anything we need. Now the bad parts...the room fluctuated between being very warm and very cold. It was never really comfortable, temperature wise. There was temperature control but it didn't seem to be doing any good. There was no microwave, fridge, or coffee maker. I'm okay with no microwaves but the fridge and the coffee makers are always a must.

After spending the morning in the pool before check in I went to the room for a quick nap. After I got in bed I noticed a funny smell, pulled back the sheets and there was FECAL MATTER in the bed. Needless to say I was in shock, crying and shaking. We called management (we took pics of the rest of the filth in the room - a green mucus loogie on the wall, somebody's necklace under the desk & PILLS on the floor in the closet). They took almost an hour to show up.

 The first ""manager"" we dealt with said ""well, how do you know it's fecal matter, it cold be something else?"" (AS IF that's OKAY?!) I told him to smell it and check if he'd like. He then offered to send 'maid service' up as a solution. This was around 3pm. 

By 5pm we were dealing with (another ""manager"") who was not only rude but condescending. They gave us a new room because nowhere was available on the strip, it was Memorial Day. The NEW room key didn't work and he had the nerve to say ""you know what would have been smart for you? Going to the front desk and asking for a new key, would that have been hard?"" My bf said ""we did not want to stand in line another 45 minutes, there was sh*t in our last room and she needs a shower."" He then threatened to have us escorted off the premises for swearing at him.

Maintenance came up and low and behold the door was broken. So all of Anthony's rude, condescending comments (at one point he said ""well look at you, how do we know you didn't make the mess in the first place"" and I started crying) were his. 

By then it was 6pm (we had tickets to the 7pm Zumanity - we ended up missing the show dealing with all this) He put us in a suite. The first thing we did was check the bed - hair on the pillow cases!! They changed the sheets, we missed our show, they comped the suite and gave us $50 towards room service. THAT WAS THEIR ""RESOLUTION."" We still had to pay resort fees etc and we still haven't been able to get in touch with RICHIE the ""direct supervisor."" 

""manager 2""  told me there is ""no corporate office to complain to it's privately owned"" and refused to give us his last name. So ""private owner"" I hope you see this review and re-evaluate who you employ at your facility. (yelp removed the original post because I used employee names- this re-post is without them.)

I TRAVEL regularly for my job and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had. 

The only saving grace was Andrew, the security guard with a goatee, he was kind and helpful through the whole process and was the only person with any sympathy towards the disgusting situation.

When babes & I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas, the last thing on our minds was having an issue with our room reservation. So when we arrived to Hard Rock  hotel to check in at 3:30 in the morning, our headache began.

As he's checking in, I'm walking around looking at the display for items worn by Brittany Spears, Michael Jackson, Aerosmith and No Doubt. Before I could take a step further, I overhear guest services giving him a hard time with checking in. I'm not having any of that so I go find out what the issue is. Guest services than tells me of the error with our room reservation. We had booked the room through a third party company and Hard rock mistakenly input our check in date for the following day. One would assume that Hard Rock would take responsibility for their mistake and fix the problem, but supposdly they were sold out of all the rooms.  It's not the Venetian or the Palazzo, I found it hard to believe this off the strip not even worthy empty casino would be sold out of 670 rooms. 

Going in circles and having to repeat ourselves  with this guest service representative was a waste of time and breathe. Though I'm not an angry person, I want to Kung Fu Panda the rep just for being unprofessional, unwilling to help and for disrespectful torwards my guy. Having had enough, we called for the manager who was too "" busy""  to talk to us in person but instead chooses to relay the message over the phone of their mistake. No apologies or attempt to rectify the situation.

BUYER BE WARNED!!!!! 

The customer service at this hotel is a nightmare!! I booked two pool view queen bed (2) suites in the HRH tower (aka the ultra premium VIP tower) for my friends bachelorette party, 6 months prior to my arrival date. I called the hotel three times before we arrived to ensure that we would have beds for 4 people per room and adjoining rooms, one of the phone calls I made was literally the day before I arrived. When we arrived to the hotel I was informed that we would not be in queen bed suites and instead given a king room with 1 roll away bed. In addition our suites would not be adjoining let alone on the same floor. After some tactful negotiation I was ""upgraded"" to a 2 deluxe pool view suites and would be given extra linens for a guest to sleep on the couch in each room and our suites would at least be on the same floor. At this point I got on the hotel's website from my phone to see that the hotel was not even fully booked for the weekend and they were showing queen suites in this tower still available!!! 

When I arrived to my room I found that a ""deluxe"" pool view room meant that there was 50 extra square feet to the room with an extra chair. Big deal! My room did not even have a view of the pool!!! I immediately called down to the manager on duty and explained our situation. Ashley was her name. She explained to me that it is not in the Hard Rock Hotels policy to guarantee queen suites even when a guest has booked AND payed in full for the rooms 6 MONTHS in advance. I understood as it was a busy weekend but was concerned for the guests in my party who had paid to sleep in a BED (like this was so much to ask for). She offered to ""upgrade us"" (down grade in fact) to normal rooms in the Casino Tower with NO CHARGE TO US, but Ashley added ""The rooms in that tower are NOT AS NICE."" 

By this point I was frustrated so I asked her if I could talk this over with my guests and get back to her. Three conversations later, one of which was with another manager named Grant who HUNG UP on me (even though I was composed and polite the whole time), Ashley negotiated to refund us 60 per room as a COURTESY because the hotel had done NOTHING WRONG (which I never received at checkout) and adding an additional roll away bed to each suite so my guests would have somewhere to sleep! I settled with this. 

An hour later we received our luggage, not at the fault of the poor bell desk person who was the sole person on duty (he was actually very nice and apologetic). Thus I called Ashley again to tell her about, once again, the poor customer service we were receiving. She at this point told me she was UNDERSTAFFED for the hotels opening season weekend and that she could offer me no other help. She added I was more than welcome to leave the hotel at no cost to me if I would be ""OFF THE PREMISES"" in 30 minutes. 

Due to the fact we could find no other place for a group of 8 to stay this weekend we did bunker down and stay. 

IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE HOTEL HAS RECENTLY FILED BANKRUPTCY! The customer service alone will bar me from ever considering them as a place to stay while on vacation in Vegas. 

The only highlight to the hotel was the pool, but BUYER BE WARNED this section is owned and operated by a separate management group. Thus you can enjoy the pool facilities at the Hard Rock without being a guest there!

Overall i give it two stars--
the plus+ is that it has cool rock n roll memorabilia everywhere and the food in the hotel was very pleasant
+hotel bedding was comfy, nice flat screen tv
--the negatives--
-the pool was a big disappointment especially when its 110 and all you want to do during the day is hang at the pool, why because they only have 40 plus lawn chairs to layout on when thousands of people stay here--what was annoying is they had other areas for people to sit but (little square couch seats), but my hubby and I were kicked off because to sit on those seats you had to atleast spend $150 on drinks. Might I add no one was sitting up there, they were all empty, we were stuck sitting on hot concrete which did not make sense, so we tried to get there early the following morning and they kick us out because they had pipe problems, and then that afternoon around 4pm they shut it down, for a concert that was occuring inside, might I add this is occuring on a friday afternoon.
Also their pool drinks  $22 dollar mixed drinks which was watered down and yes you had two choices for beverage sizes small plastic cup $13 bucks and for a large souvenir plastic cup-$22 bucks.

The hotel brags alot about the whole pool scene,rehab was a joke.. i was disappointed and they closed the pool alot for different reasons, -

-Also nothing is included with this hotel, a lot of nickel and diming for everything, beware, you may find it on priceline for a decent price, but there are alot of hidden fees...added fees once you check in.
And plus to add to that this hotel is not near the strip and not in walking distance during the hot season, beware...1.5 mile walk

overall--If you are not interested in their pool and have the extra cash to spill out than sure stay there,
if you want a nice pool environment look elsewhere and just visit the hotel to look at their rock n roll memorablia..",1,0,0

1) Off the strip -  this is fine as long as there is shuttle.
2) You are forced to pay a $16.80 ""Resort"" fee. This is fine if it included more amenities and a shuttle service that doesn't end at 5pm. Essentially, you are forced to drive to the strip or take taxis back, because 5pm is practically mid-day in Vegas.
3) At checkin, we didn't get the room we reserved. We were lied to and switched to another room. That room was a smoking room with a nasty smell and scratches on the walls and doors -must have been a room Charlie Sheen used to frequent. Switched a third time and discovered the previous lobby clerk lied and there was a room available for us.
4) Sportsbook (barely) - Discovered that sports betting only gives you a drink ticket for every $50 bet.
5) 1 drink ticket only gets you a domestic beer or well drink, if you get a Stella or Amstel, they require 2 tickets! Yes, that's 1 Amstel light for 100$ in sports betting.
6) Went to the Player's club to get a player's card. Was in line at 11:45pm, waited there 15 minutes before getting to the clerk. Once I got to her, I asked for a player's card. She then told me they were closed. I asked her what time they closed, she said 12AM. Then I asked what time was it, she said 12:01. She saw me there standing in line the whole time and only turned off the lights right before I approached. What the f$%k kind of customer service is this?
7) They don't provide you with any lotion. It's a desert and the AC\/Heaters always dry you out even more.
8) Got stuck in the cheek with a feather sticking out of the pillow...not a great way to wake up.
9) All other things being equal, the rating depends on the value. If this was a cheap hotel, than such things are more acceptable. It is rated as a 4 star, more like a 3 star IMO. We paid around $120 per night over the Thanksgiving weekend.

Things I liked.
1) Decent music playing the entire time, didn't hear any Gaga, Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Bieber, Kanye, etc.
2) Hot pole dancing girls in the casino.",3,5,0

When I checked in after waiting through the long but realtively speedy line, I asked if we could waive the resort fee as none of the amenities were needed. I was told no. 

 The room was very nice as was the cleaning staff. The television system is a bit antiquated. While overall very clean, the hotel is showing it's age as the carpeting is fraying in the tower that I stayed in on this trip. I came in from a walk near the suite tower entrance and wanting a beer, I stopped in the gift shop there. They wanted $5.13 for a Corona. Really?

 In my opinion, they should stop the price gouging and try and serve the customer rather than gouging their customers. Had the daily resort fee not nearly doubled my room rate I would have been more satisfied.

However, my friend was a Vegas newbie with a narrow-minded plan of spending most of her time lounging by the pool.  Her sister advised us that we just had to book our stay with the Hard Rock Hotel.  Since I had yet to try this destination and because of its party atmosphere, I conceded to the suggestion.  We planned our trip to span a Thursday through Monday to ensure that we would be poolside for the Sunday Rehab party, which was still advertised as a prominent event on their website, though we had already entered the Fall season.

We arrived on the scheduled Thursday afternoon and were confronted with a lengthy check-in line.  We were dying to get settled and start our trip, but we were not allowed to check in prior to their 3 pm time.  We were told that our room was ready but awaiting approval from the housekeeping manager, which should only take one hour.  We dragged our luggage into the Pink Taco restaurant to grab some tasty Mexican salads (see separate review) and to enjoy the sun on the patio.  We returned to the check in desk over an hour later and were told that our room was still awaiting approval, but that we could immediately settle into a room on a lower floor.  At this point, we were just eager to get to the pool, so we agreed to the lesser room, which wound up providing a hideous view of the parking garage!  The room itself had funky wallpaper, a spacious bathroom, an iPod dock with speakers, and a large flat-screen television.  

We had mixed feelings regarding our stay.  First, their website did not mention that the Sunday Rehab party was over for the season or that their pool was not heated.  So, basically, everyone was relaxing poolside in the 80-degree weather, but had nowhere to properly cool off.  In regards to the crowd, I love Jon M's review comparing this to New Jersey; my friend and I thought we were back home among Jersey shore guidos.  Fist pumping was definitely not our scene...A final note on the pool is that the waitresses were extremely friendly on Thursday afternoon, but became snooty and pretentious on the weekend.  It was as if they were trying to exude a ""cool"" vibe for the rowdy Saturday-Sunday crowd.  All of the pretentiousness was more discouraging than impressive.  

Additionally, the hotel's free shuttle to the Strip only arrived once every hour and did not even stop anywhere close to Las Vegas Boulevard.  We wound up opting for taxi service instead, which saved time but cost $10 each way.  

I was also annoyed by the $20 a day fee to use the fitness center, which was attached to the spa rather than being a part of the hotel.  The large room was packed with equipment and would have been the perfect way to counteract my extravagant dinners and evening cocktails, but I refused to pay for this ""amenity"".

The main reasons to stay at the Hard Rock are for the crazy atmosphere, terrific nightlife options, and large pool grotto.   However, many of these things are negligible and can be found at other properties.  I would recommend staying on the Strip instead.",1,0,1

When I arrived, the check-in process was pretty fast except for the fact that I had to make sure I check-in every day of my stay because I bought 3 different vouchers (not that there was another option available anyhow). We were 3 people. We entered the suite and it was just as we saw on the virtual tour we took before reserving. Satisfactory. There was a large bed, a two-piece sofa, 2 flat screen TV's (which were never turned-on), 2 stereo system for iOS devices (I had an Android device :\/ ) and a huge glass-covered bathroom with a stand-up shower and a bathtub.
The reason for giving the hotel 3 stars is not necessarily because of bad experiences, it's because of the timing of the reservation.
I saw a lot of potential for the pool parties, which we were not in good timing for. The casino was not very young and the restaurant down at the lobby is not worth eating at.
A positive is although the hotel is off the strip, there is a free shuttle leaving the hotel every hour towards the strip. The club in the hotel is supposedly good, but we never had a chance to party there.",0,0,0

My husband and I stayed in the HRH tower which has the nicest rooms you can get at the Hard Rock but the furniture is pretty beat up. You can tell they have had some crazy parties in there. 
Also they have snacks in your room you could purchase. They had an intimacy kit and head phones that were $40-$50 each. I was picking up everything trying the find the headphones I couldn't see.

Pros:  the beds are awesome!  I don't know what it's like to sleep on a cloud, but if I had to imagine, these beds are it!

That being said, that's the best selling point.  :(

Cons:  so let's start at the beginning..
Signage in the driveway and the parking garage suck!   There are some one way streets around the hotel, so you have to make loops if you miss your turn.  No driveway signage, so we ended up in the taxi line by accident (no traffic control at all, employees\/valets kept jumping out and crossing the street).  If you were to follow arrows in the garage, you would drive into a chained off area!  

Check in took forever!  20+ minutes!  One girl checking people in on Memorial Day weekend who was kind of ditzy and kept commenting on how surprised she was that it was busy.   There were two groups in front of us, and that is counting the group she was helping.  Finally when we got to the counter, another guy came up to help her and checked in the one guy behind us.  Boo to your customer service HRH.

The room itself was fairly nice cosmetically.  Glad we had gotten a promotional deal because I don't think I would pay the $500 they were charging for a Saturday night stay on Memorial weekend.

Musically, I was upset.  One ""amenity"" they offer is a touch screen music player. It updated ALL night.  It kept saying that it was updating and service would return shortly.  Well in the 12 hours that we were in the room it never worked!  I tried my iPod then my iPhone in the dock and neither worked either!   I also tried the iHome dock on the nightstand but that was broken too!   Ugh!  So I called guest service on the cheap feeling cordless phone.  It took 9 rings for someone to answer!!! The I was placed on a ""brief"" hold of 4 minutes?!?!  I asked how long the update was going to take.  ""I don't know."" What?!? Make something up, I don't care!  That's more bad service in my book.  ""Well the system automatically updates all our movies and music once a month."". Uh someone screwed up!  Maybe someone should have rescheduled this particular update seeing how the hotel is sold out!!  Lame!

There are two TVs in the room, but both remotes sucked.  No guide except for the hotel and their channels.  The station would change and you could hear the next channel, but the picture would take another 5 seconds or so to change.

Oh and good luck to you if you have to use the restroom at 5am.  So there is a master light switch somewhere in the room.  I'm still not sure which one it is, but when it's on none of the other switches work!  Why you would disable the lights in the toilet with a master switch is beyond me.

Great potential,  POOR execution!!!!!!",1,2,0

Review #35:
well, the best part of the Hard Rock Casino has to be the tons of cool photos, guitars, & displays from various rock bands over the years; the walls are really like a rock & roll museum; even the modest conference hall has cool art work & photos of musicians; the main check-in area has huge photos of David Bowie, Robert Smith, and even Pelle Almqvist staring at you!; it seems like I've been here a lot already, due to concerts at The Joint, and especially Vinyl (Courtney Love, The Hold Steady, Art Alexakis, Jenny McCarthy, DiceMan, oh my!); Culinary Dropout and Pink Taco are 2 hip & fun restaurants\/bars that are quite affordable; Nobu seems incongruous at the Hard Rock, and the interior is not that impressive; great outdoor lagoon-ish pool area with lots of palm trees; the central bar & gaming area has N-R-G, with pumping music and scantily clad pole dancers; bets craft beer bet = quite disappointing; Culinary Dropout is by far the best, but they had zero dark craft beers on tap in mid-winter",3,0,0

I had a great time overall, but it's clear to me now that we were just paying for the brand Hard Rock instead of any added luxury compared to other resorts. For what Hard Rock charges for a room, you'd think that the hotel would be maintained and have kept their appearance up. Other than the rooms, the Casino and resort were nice overall.

Pluses: 
-Our king room was a nice size and I loved the fact that we could open the french doors to the balcony. We were above the Hard Rock Guitar and could open the balcony and had total privacy. That was pretty awesome (except for the loud heat and air conditioning units on the roof below us).
-Our bed was SUPER comfy!! The mattress and bedding were luxurious and made me feel like I re-entered the womb. 
-I enjoyed the decor. It was cool. It was nice not having the generic tropical bedding and ugly carpet like at other vegas hotels. It was comfortable and cool.
-The staff we encountered was nice. The bellperson and maids we spoke to were welcoming and cool. 
-The Casino itself was awesome. Great vibe, great staff, great crowd, and unpretentious. I kind of felt cooler for staying there.
-We had a great brunch at Culinary Dropout.

The Meh Factor:
-Too far from the strip. The shuttle they provide only runs every hour until 5 pm, so we never ended up taking it. The distance from the strip made it a destination for cool people and prevented everyone on the street from walking in like resorts on the strip. Can't decide if the distance was worth it, though. It would be PERFECT if it were closer to the strip. 
-We reserved 2 king rooms that we wanted close to each other, but naturally they didnt have it and gave us 1 king and 1 with 2 queens, no biggie, it ended up working out fine. 

The not-so-great-parts:
-As you walk down the hall you notice the light fixtures are covered with cool Zyldjian cymbals... except every other one is missing. It's clear that once they get stolen they never get replaced. I cant decide if that was supposed to be hard rock, punk rock, or just plain ghetto.
-one of the lamps next to the bed was broken and if touched would just spin downwards. 
-gum on the ceiling covering a blinking green light. Luckily the gum covered it for us, but you can totally tell that someone was pissed off enough to put gum on it. I wonder how long its been up there for.
-I didnt like the bathroom at all. Yes, there is a metal sink. How trendy and rock. But the shower curtain looked like it was borrowed from a hospital. White with blue dots- Im not kidding when I say it looked like a hospital gown.

I was going to give my stay 3 stars, but after experiencing massive douche-baggery and unnecessary rudeness and pretentiousness at other resorts on this trip, im giving the Hard Rock 4 stars for being so cool.",4,2,3

This review is based on the Casino Tower.

The hotel and casino is pretty cool based on all of the neat music items they have such as pictures of musicians, clothes that musicians wore, records, musical instruments.  All of this was very neat and fun to look at.

The room was eh. Granted I was located in the older tower. This tower LOOKED old. There was a lot of nicks on the walls. The room was not cleaned very well....there was a lid to a Pringles can found. I know people have stayed in the room before me, but I do not want to see the evidence of it.

The bed was nice and the sheets were soft. There as an iPOD doc, mini bar and some other munchies. The room included a flat screen TV and a bathroom was an unusually deep bathtub. Meaning, you almost had to dismount to get in and out of the 
place, especially if you are on the short side of the vertical spectrum.

The casino was just fine, on the smaller side. There was food options, but not a lot. I liked that this place did not get as busy as the places actually on the strip. This meant 
that there was a good chance you could get on a machine when you wanted to.

The fitness center is not huge, but adequate. Make sure that you ask for a towel at the front desk of the fitness center if they do not offer you one. The machines are okay...but all the elipticals are the ones that are on ""rollers""...which is okay, but not the best. Still by far a deal breaker.

All and all, I would probably stay here again. The walk to the strip s a bit much but do able.",3,1,2

The first time I came here was back in 2001 and I have come back every year since and in recent years, I've been staying here 2 to 3 times a year when I'm in Vegas.  I really like the atmosphere here with all the young people and the loud music after 9pm.  It's definitely changed over the years with the addition of the two new towers and the added casino floor under the HRH tower.  The expansion took away from the coziness of the place where 1000s of people used to just be packed into the center bar and casino area.  I was just there this past weekend and it seemed slower than usual but there was still a good mix of people in the casino and the pool.  Speaking of the pool, it's the main reason I like staying at the Hard Rock - it's like being at the beach but when you're done, you can go inside, get food, and gamble...

As far as the hotel itself goes, it seems like the Hard Rock focuses on their two new towers (Paradise and HRH) and not really up-keeping the casino tower rooms.  I got a pool view room in the casino tower on the 10th floor this past weekend and the air conditioner didn't function properly.  At times, it would pump out hot air even though the thermostat said 65F and when we turned it off, the air kept going.  I've stayed in the Paradise tower in the past and it was nice but I still go back to the casino tower because of the French doors.  Not too many hotels allow you to open up your windows, let alone doors, to take in what Vegas has to offer.  Our friend stayed in the HRH tower in a corner suite with a city and pool view on the 10th floor and it was definitely nice.  The bathroom was huge and the L-couch was a nice touch to lounge around and drink before hitting the casino for the night.

Overall, I still enjoy the Hard Rock and keep on coming back, especially since I have a player's card with them and they send me great deals every three months to get me back to Sin City...",0,1,0

I've been the duke here for quite some time. I've been a customer for awhile. Many ups and downs here. I've always liked the style because it's things I like...rock n roll, leather and lace, etc. I've been to several events here from AVN to miss Asian where I was a supporter in 2014. I've been personally involved with some adult stars so that's why I went to AVN. I've seen this place go through a lot of changes in the last 4 years. They have all generally been good. They are currently going through a lot of changes that started earlier this year and they are almost done. I kind of feel like that's why the play is less than par. This time last year, I had a lot of free play. When I casino gives out a lot of free play, that tells me they are making money and can offer that. If a casino is making money than, it seems the machines pay out better. 

This is not the case lately. The promotions are very minimal. They try to offer this play 20 and get 10 deal. It is a very cheap offer. I'm not talking about the amount, I'm talking about the way it works which tells me they are not making much money at all, currently. Like I said, I go by a casinos promotions.

Their beds are fabulous and terribly comfortable, while being extremely stylish. The shower is also the best shower I've ever experienced. That deserves repeating...

The shower is the BEST I have ever experienced.

Pink Taco downstairs is tasty & pretty affordable. I also got a great cheap pair of sunglasses in the gift shop since I broke mine right as I arrived in Las Vegas.

I was talking with one of the bell-hops and he said they got complaints about the rock music constantly playing.

I have been to Hard Rock Hotel on many occasions to eat at Culinary Dropout but for the first time ever I decided to book a room and stay the night as I was attending a big party there.  I booked a room the same day as my stay.  After booking my Deluxe Suite online directly through their website, I called reservations three times throughout the day to make sure the suite I booked was in fact available and to check on larger suites.  Upon arrival, I was informed that they were sold out of the Deluxe Suite and were going to move me to a newer tower with a much smaller room.  I was not okay with that.  I had paid $400 for the night and didn't want a smaller room.  Eventually the manager upgraded me and I was appreciative.

I have never come across such a rule and I found that to be quite an inconvenience.  The Celebrity Suite was nice but honestly I don't think I would spend $1000 a night to stay in it.  All in all our stay was okay but I would definitely stay somewhere else before returning here.",6,3,3

I ignored my friends that recommended different hotels.  Not being a regular at Vegas, I trusted Hotel Tonight's categorization that said it was on the Strip (It's well off the Strip I found)

Check in was convoluted, had to walk through the casino from parking lot to check in,

Atmosphere was like a frat house.

Room- no coffee maker, everything cost $, the safe wasn't cleared, so I couldn't use it, the ironing board was missing, so I ironed my shirt on the floor, the TV was an OLD LCD that had jacked up aspect ratios that didn't auto sync, so the picture was horrible...

Usually when I come to Vegas I try to stay at the Palazzo, but recently my boyfriend and I planned a super last minute Vegas trip. Last minute as in we didn't even book our hotel until we were seated on the plane... Because of this we decided to just book through hotels tonight and since Hard Rock was a great deal, we decided to stay there. We had stayed at the Hard Rock about a year before in the HRH Tower and enjoyed it. The room was spacious, updated, and surprisingly really nice so we thought what do we have to lose! 
Welllll the answer is a lot. Probably partially our fault for booking so late, but when we got there the only room they had available was a King room in the Casino Tower, and it was a smoking room. We specifically asked for a non smoking room but the front desk assured us it was the ONLY king room they had available. I was shocked when we walked in. It looked like they took a Motel 6 room and (unsuccessfully) tried to spruce it up with some paint and artwork. It reeked of smoke. The shower, TV and phone were all broken. We contacted the front desk to see if we could upgrade to a suite or something just to get out of the room but they said they were booked and nothing was available, but to try again in the morning. 
I called back first thing in the morning and thankfully they were able to upgrade us to a top floor pool view room in the Paradise Tower. SO MUCH BETTER. I couldn't even believe that these rooms were a part of the same hotel. The new room was beautiful, clean, updated, had an amazing view. The only downside was that because Rehab was right outside the window, it was pretty loud from like 11am-6\/7pm every day, but that wasn't a big deal to us. 

A couple other notes about the hotel:
-Rehab is actually pretty fun, and you get a discount if you are a hotel guest (plus it's super convenient and you save $$ on a taxi ride to\/from Wet Republic or any of the other pool parties)
-The hotel actually has some good restaurants inside: Culinary Dropout, Nobu etc 
-Although it's off the strip, it's really quick and easy uber\/taxi ride to get to the main part of the strip. Wasn't a problem for us at all. 
-Body English sucks. Don't even waste your time. Waaay better off going to one of the big clubs on the main strip if you want to go out. 
-Everythinggg is expensive here. Drinks at rehab were upwards of $30\/each. But duh, it's Vegas and it's to be expected.
-We were able to pay an extra $30 on Sunday for a 4pm checkout. Soooo so so worth it when you have a 6pm flight. Being able to sleep in after a late night Saturday is priceless. 

In short- not a bad option if you want to save some money on your Vegas trip. Definitely not as luxurious as the Palazzo or the Wynn but it is possible to get a nice room here! Don't waste your time with the Casino Tower and request a room in the HRH or Paradise Tower instead!",2,0,0

Go across the street to CVS. The bathroom has no countertop to put any toiletries, just a sink. You will hear quite a bit of jet noise since you're close to the airport, plus noisy guests in the hall. Lower floors with ""mountain view"" rooms will not be able to see over the new Joint in front of the hotel. The beds are comfortable though. 

The casino is small and easy to navigate. The clientele seems to be 20 somethings. The casino has a few restaurants but there are better priced options elsewhere, though the wait staff were friendly. 

The best part of the casino is the pool area. Be warned there is construction going on around the pool but it wasn't obtrusive. Drink prices are pricy. $7 for a can of Heineken. The bartenders and staff are very nice though. 

There is a shuttle that runs every half hour to the Showcase Mall (next to MGM) from 11am to 9pm. You can catch it from in front of the Hard Rock Cafe. If you don't have a car taxi rides to and from the strip will run you about $10 plus. It is not close enough to walk. 

Be warned this place charges you a $7.63 a day ""resort fee"". Whatever that is. They don't tell you about this, but you'll see it when you check out. I don't know what you get for this undisclosed fee but won't get a coffee maker, or even a pen and notepad.",0,0,2

Not a chance that we were staying in the room, we got into our bikinis and pranced downstairs to Rehab, where we discovered that the party was all hype. The pool waters were a murky tan, the dancing drunken hussies were unattractive at best, and to top it all off, we were all being filmed. We laid out for a moment and decided it'd be best to roam the boulevard. We actually spent a lot of time in the beautiful suite, ordering room service, and just enjoying quality time. We discovered that the huge plasma in the center of our suite broadcasted Rehab and we got quite a kick out of that show. All in all, the hotel services and amenities were kick ass.

I booked through Groupon which was fine, but when I got there, they gave me a room with 2 double beds when I booked a King.  The beds were comfy and the view was nice.

Pros: 
Comfortable Beds
Cool rock memorabilia
Easy access free parking based on the tower you are staying in

Cons:
Huge Hotel, lots of long hallways
Cleaning staff doesn't replenish all of the complimentary soaps and shower stuff or empty the trash everyday.
Room and bathroom is very dark
No fridge
No complimentary water
Not many towels

The worst part: When checking in, they will tell you they gave you a complimentary upgrade to a pool view.  DON'T TAKE IT!  During the day the pool area has the loudest club music playing and it will reverb in your room making it impossible to relax for a long night ahead.  The music starts at 11am, so don't plan on sleeping in after getting back to the hotel at 3am. It's ridiculous and maddening to not have a quiet room during the day to get away from the noise of Vegas.  Your room should be your quiet sanctuary and not polluted by loud music all day.

We couldn't take the noise another day, so we checked out a day early and drove home.  The hotel couldn't refund our last night as I booked through a third party, but they were nice enough to not charge a couple of nights resort fee.",5,1,0

Un poco lejos del centro de Las Vegas, más próximo al aeropuerto, te ofrece spa, piletas, lugar donde hacerte tatuajes, tienda de ropa, cafés, conciertos, pizzerías, restaurantes, joyería, boliches, gimnasio y (obviamente) un ENORME casino. También tienen un micro que cada una hora pasa para llevarte al centro. 

Las habitaciones están separadas en torres, nombradas según la calle en la que se encuentren. Todas tienen un estacionamiento propio, y están intercomunicadas por el casino. En realidad, vayas adonde vayas vas a tener que atravesarlo. Si a la mañana querés ir a la pileta (""muy"" temprano), por ejemplo, la única abierta es la familiar y van a tener que caminar bastante por ahí (obvio que dependiendo de la torre en la que estén hospedados).

Lo que más choca, después de acostumbrarte a las luces y espectáculos,  es que los negocios cierran muy temprano. No sólo adentro del hotel, obvio, pero publicitan la pizzería con carteles que dicen ""abre hasta muy tarde"" y a la medianoche están cerrando. 

En cuanto a las habitaciones, todo depende de cuál reserven. La nuestra era enorme, y el baño muy cómodo. Las piletas estaban afuera, y eran dos ubicadas adelante de una pared  completamente espejada. Había dos almohadas extra en el placard, y varias toallas. 

El servicio es buenísimo, y si necesitan algo siempre atienden el teléfono. Si llamás a la línea equivocada te mandan al interno. ¿Lo único malo? Tocan una sola vez la puerta antes de abrirla, no te dan mucho tiempo a acercarte o (porque puede pasar) cambiarte o evitar algo incómodo.",0,0,0

However, this was the worst hotel as far as service that I have ever stayed in! None of the employees are willing to provide assistance. It seemed like they just wanted to do the very minimum to get by and complete their shift. Also, the pool was freezing (even in the 90 degree weather) and closes too early. 

We were going to take the shuttle to the strip on the first day but noticed a sign that read ""7 passenger maximum""; there were already more than 7 people in line, so we walked over to the Taxi line. A member of the bell staff told us the shuttle actually could hold 20 people, so we left our spot in the taxi line only to find out from the shuttle driver that the car indeed only holds 7 passengers. 

Later on that day, we were at the pool trying to rent a day bed. We asked a guy that was in the pool staff uniform and he told us we had to ask another guy. When we asked that employee about it he said he would help us in a few min. We waited 15 min for him while he was chatting with some other guests and eventually just took a vacant day bed where we hung out for 20 min for a waiter to come by to get our drink order..... no one ever came by. 

The next evening, I called ""In Room Dining"". The person that answered the phone, put me on hold for 5 min upon answering without asking permission first. When she got back on the phone, she abruptly told me that the food would take over an hour to arrive to my room. She came across as irritated when I was asking her about cheese options for the burger. The food arrived in 15 min while I was in the shower. 

When I checked in a few days prior, I asked the employee at the front desk how I would go about printing, scanning, and emailing some documents for work. He said the only way to do this was to use the ""Business Center"". In the morning, just before checkout, we paid $20 to use the center for just enough time to print, scan and email 4 pieces of paper. The cost was $22. Upon checking out, the lady told my boyfriend that the front desk could have taken care of any computer services for free. We walk out to get the bell staff to hold our luggage while we eat brunch and gamble before our flight. A member of the bell staff asks us "" how are you doing today"". We answer ""Not good at all"" his reply is ""Oh"". We end up taking our bags and spending the rest of our time in Vegas at another hotel. I was not about to give this establishment one more dollar.

Don't worry, $10 I spent for the margarita at the Pink Taco restaurant downstairs was plenty. Got to the room, only to find dried pee all over the toilet seat.  Nice touch.

Also left a message for accounting, they completely blew me off.  Called again the next day, finally got someone who knew how to pull up the account and tell me what's going on.  ""Late checkout fee, we'll need to have an investigation and call you back"".  So now, I've spent 4 days messing with this, enough already, I'm calling the bank.  The bank reversed the charge, and I finally heard back from the Hard Rock that they'd back it out.   Maybe the bank called them?

It's The Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas!  I stayed here in late October 2015 for a business conference held by a company that clearly wanted it's guests to get to business, and also enjoy some Las Vegas fun!  The Hard Rock is located about 5 or 10 minutes off of the Las Vegas Strip, but it is a destination in itself, given its shops, restaurants, casino, huge swimming pools, bars, night club, beach club, and more...The decor is Rock N Roll, but tasteful.  The rooms are Rock N Roll, but well appointed and tasteful.

Strolling around this huge hotel to enjoy the abundant Rock N Roll memorabilia is reason alone to have a stay at this lively resort, which feels like a combination of Las Vegas Casino meets the Rock and Roll Hall of fame!  Music plays throughout, beach parties invite, food, shopping, and healthy vice beckons, and the staff were very accommodating!  

I needed particular help from the staff when one in my party needed medical attention at a local hospital, and the staff afforded us an extra night at a steep discount, and seemed happy to help.  I was there for a business conference as I mentioned, and it worked well, but it should be said that this hotel was very well priced given all it has to offer, and if you like a lively, rock and roll scene, this is particularly set to deliver, and for a bachelor or bachelorette party, well, let the debauchery begin, because you're likely to have a legendary stay!

But it should also be said that if you'd like a quiet, subdued, uneventful stay with grandma and the kids... um, try another hotel.  In fact, not for nothin', but, you may want to consider a whole different city.

That's where all the young kids stay these days--it has a pool, a bar, and a casino!""

And, turns out, not just ""young kids"" stay here.

So, I settled on a 2.
Keep in mind, I think anyone that spends time in their hotel room in Vegas other than the Triple S (shave, shit, shower) combo is beyond words.

The Pros - 
Decor is top of the line.  Everything in the place is interesting to look at.  Even the elevators have interesting song lyrics on the railing type thing - ""Take me down to the paradise city..."", etc.
The beds are like sleeping on a cloud.  They have so much fluff, you almost hate going back to your bed - I said ALMOST...
There are tons of snacks and drinks in the room that, if you don't mind whoring yourself out to pay the extreme costs for, you can enjoy....yeesh!
The view is really cool.  We scoped out the pool scene before heading down so that we could find a spot.

The Cons - 
This is the biggest one - Pay Attention....
You are a mile from the strip.  Forget about walking anywhere.  You're going to have to have\/rent a car, or pay a cab, etc.  This is a huge....I said HUGE pain in the rear.  You pay a lot for the hotel, the flight out there, the food, etc.  Instead of putting the money into a rental or cabs, just pay a few bucks more and stay on the strip.  You'll thank me later.
Honestly, the rest of the cons don't matter.  In my opinion, being so far away from everything was it., but if you're really interested in things that don't matter...here they are:
There is literally a sign in the mini fridge that reads if you put your personal belongings in there, they won't stay cold.  WHAAAA?  How the hell does that shit work?  So the crap that's in there is cold, but if you put something in, it doesn't get cold?  How does that work?  WTF?  Is there like a heat seeking laser in the back  that seeks foreign warmth and destroys?  
The shower, while interesting to look at, has cracks in the door.  READ - After your shower there is water Effin everywhere!  Think it's fun to drop anchor while you're feet are in water?  Me neither.  Disgusting.

All in all, that stuff doesn't mean a thing.  The main thing is to find a hotel to crash at so that you can go everywhere else.  Hard Rock is great for the stuff there, but if you want to leave, it's like a major project.  That's not even taking into account if you're a dumb ass like me who forgets shit like it's a bodily function.  

My tip is to find a place on the strip and go nuts.",0,1,0

The halls to the restaurants and stores give off an old, need-a-makeover vibe.  Where is their money going? The casino and area immediately surrounding the casino look nice and kept up, and the ""beautiful people"" add to the dressed-up appearance. But elsewhere I felt the place looked run-down. 

We went to the pool for the recent reggae event.  My friend told me that when celebs perform at the pool and you see the area on TV, it looks very nice.  In person, I was underwhelmed. The pool itself looked fine, but the water isn't heated so the swimmers were freeeeezing, which was pretty amusing.  

The extra-sized ""chaises"" looked cheap and worn, though they were comfortable enough to relax on for the couple of hours we were there.  The cabanas were pretty simple with very cheap-looking seating. They are wired and contained a flatscreen TV on some wooden furniture. Some people turned on their TV and had it playing loudly during part of the concert, and they weren't even in the cabana. RUDE.

Outside the cabanas were overhead misters- at least in front of some of them.  I would not have spent the extra money for a cabana- they were absolutely nothing special.   Sprucing up the seating areas and updating the colors and fabrics would do a lot for this area because design-wise, it's not a horrible space. The view is better after dark, when floodlights of changing colors highlight the hotel, and a roving spotlight livens up the place. After dark you can't see the worn out, uninspired furnishings.  

The people there for the concert leaned towards young, so there was some roughhousing and, shall we say, ""poor etiquette"" amongst some of the crowd, but nothing ever got out of hand or particularly unpleasant, outside the strange TV incident. The sound system was great and the stage was easily viewable past the standing crowed, even from the cabana area across the pool.

Security could stand to learn how to treat customers. Some of them looked sloppy, and did not come across as professional.  We were allowed to enter the pool area after showing our tickets, but then another security guard rudely (with a condescending smile) told us that if we didn't have wristbands, we  needed to ""go right back out those doors"".  We didn't need wristbands. I don't mind mistakes, but don't be a jerk.

This hotel belongs in Reno.  Not in Las Vegas.  Wait... I might be insulting Reno here....?  Naaah... Reno sucks.  So does Hard Rock Hotel.

When I arrive in Vegas, I get into my ""vegas mode"".  Heck, I get off the plane in ""vegas mode""!  I think ""vegas style"".  I want to see ""vegas everything"" - - not Reno.  I want to look up and see murals bigger than life on the ceiling, look down and see marble more expensive than anything I normally see, look around and see people and things more beautiful than my eyes would believe.  
If you're like that - don't do the Hard Rock Hotel.
It's a little piece of Reno... in LAS VEGAS!

Upon arriving at the hotel, through the registration desk, up the elevators and to your door - Hard Rock is just a second tier hotel, at best.  Casino is miniscule, halls and elevators are ""blaah"", employees are not trained anywhere near to the standards of the other high-end hotels, and the general clientele is - in one word, trashy.  Not just the girls either - - the men, too.
And where's the LOBBY?
I mean, in my mind, when I enter the hotel, I practically need walking shoes to make it to the registration, and then bandaids to make it to the elevators, At Hard Rock - you trip and you're at the registration desk.  You stumble and you just bumped into the elevator.  What is this - the COMFORT INN?

OK, so admittedly, the pool is said to be cool, and it's a regular ""Girls Gone Wild"" out there.  Alright, I can see the appeal this might hold for the men.... but the pool is not what I go to Vegas for, I have a pool in my backyard.  I want to see a true LAS VEGAS HOTEL.  I want gambling that will make my eyes bulge out.  I WANT BLING BLING!

*****************
SIDENOTE:  Now, if I were 17 and was going to  go to Vegas -  I, too, might have chosen Hard Rock and joined in on the filming of ""Girls Gone Wild"" by the pool, and then maybe I would give this hotel 5 stars.  (Ha.... HIGHLY UNLIKELY!)

*****************

What does earn them at least the two stars is for being a big enough name to have ""Nobu"" inside this hotel.  Cool.  At least people will then drop by the hotel.  Nobu, and the fact that it's a mere $8 cabride to the hotel.... plus having OK rooms.  2 stars for that.

But to stay here?!!?
WHY?  I don't understand.  Yo no comprendo!

Having said all that -  the room is quite nice.  Roomier than the many of the hotels on the strip, and all in all - good enough.  Bathrooms are small and rather dinky but they do have the rainshower.  Good.  

Now, with all that, if the price were more economical, (I'm told they were charging $600\/ night for a corporate booking) they might be onto something.  With all that, if at least the service was classier, they might have earned another star.

Alas -  they have nothing to offer me.

I purchased a Groupon getaway that was billed as a 2 night stay, Sun-Thur, for 2 adults and up to 2 kids in a King room. 

When I called to make my reservation for a Sunday and Monday in June I was first told that to stay on Sunday night I would have to pay extra, after I pointed out the offer included Sunday night and read it verbatim the clerk said, ""Oh, we have six groupon offers right now""...Okay, that got straightened out so let's get on with it.  As we went through the reservation process I happened to ask where the kids slept, a sofa pulllout? I was only then told the room only has 1 King bed.....so either me, my wife, my 12 year old daughter, and 10 year old son shared one bed, or I could pay an extra $30 per night to upgrade to 2 queens.

I pointed out that either the whole 1 bed for 4 people thing should have been made clear in the offer, or the extra bed charge should have, but to advertise as a room suitable for a family of 4 was just wrong.   I repeated this to a manager.  My options remained to either spend the extra $60 for the upgrade not spelled out in the original offer or to sleep four to a bed, also not made clear in the original offer.  Well, I won't be staying at the Hard Rock-ever.  If you purchased a Groupon beware the Hard Rock bait and switch if you actually plan on taking your kids!

The room wasn't half bad but very tiny for an upgraded room. Most of the weekend I didn't spend much time in the room. However, on Sunday morning I left the hotel at about 11AM and went to the buffet at the Cosmo. I grabbed some cash out of my backpack that was within a bank envelope buried within the pack. This envelope had $1000 left in it. I ate at the Cosmo and then returned to my room at 1:45PM. Upon return the envelope in the bag was nowhere to be found and the maid service had come through in that time period serviced the room. Seems that this kind of theft is prevalent at the Hard Rock and I would not advise anyone to stay here without keeping a very watchful eye on their belongings. A complaint was lodged but, in the end there really isn't anything the hotel has done for me. I still ended up having to pay for my stay and the theft.

The room was very dark with the only lighting coming from dim lamps.  No refrigerator, no microwave.  They even have signs in the elevator lobby stating no outside food and drink.  The minibar was very well stocked and expensive.  

The bathroom was very dark and to make it worse, the tile was black, so it seemed much darker.  Also, with the dark tile, it was hard to see the wet floor.  The shower was large enough for a couple of people.

Good collection of memorabilia.  And they do play loud music.

Yes I know it's not centrally located, it is not the biggest, flashiest nicest hotel out there but all I cared about after experiencing Planet Hollywood is good costumer service.

We had a horrible experience with costumer service in the planet Hollywood so we switched for Wynn (which was full) so stayed 1 night at Hard Rock Hotel. 

Yes, it was all about customer service! 

For my surprise customer service was sweet, gentle & nice.
They really cared, room service was fast & efficient as well. 

That aside, room was way more upscale than room in Planet Hollywood (comparing apples to apples).  
Furniture were all contemporary & it had a flat HD TV.
It also had a jacuzzi bath, new carpets & paint.
And it was still close enough to our clubs.

The Casino was not super fancy shmancy, theme is a lil dull, people are defiantly something else yet down to earth. 
We did not care about all of that coause this place made us feel at home!

The bathroom had a beautiful dark red rock-damask design (weird combination right? but it works!) My only complaint about the bathroom was that the modern design of the showerhead made it have a lot less pressure than one would want -- it barely took the shampoo out! Looks nice, doesn't function as it should.

+1 for room service & the cleanliness of the overall hotel

+1 for the sun-blocking curtains that let us sleep well into the day!

+1 for carrying out the Hard Rock concept so well 

+1 for the two really good clubs in the lobby. Packed & poppin. Strong drinks. Best DJ I've ever heard - played a whole chain of the best West Coast songs! Find a recruiter walking around though that will hook you (girls) up with free entrance as opposed to $20.
 
-1 for charging us $45 for moving the mini-bar dollar shots. If you trigger the sliding sensor for more than 45 seconds, it does an auto-charge to your room bill!

So, they were happy to take our money but couldn't be bothered to save our room. The options presented to us were: A. For the first night, stay in a disgusting smoking room with 2 queen beds instead of the 1 King non-smoking we booked. B. We pay another $56 per night to upgrade to a suite for the duration of our stay (3 nights)... If that isn't extortion, I'm not sure what is. Talk about putting a sour taste in your mouth right away - ridiculous. We opted for the ""upgrade"" because we didn't want a stinky room for ANY nights.

The suite we were put in was nice on a superficial level, but on closer inspection the curtains were ripped and had some gross stains, the living room entertainment center and TV was broken, but by far worst of all, the bed was hard as a rock, springs completely worn out, and honestly wasn't that much better than the ground. The $68 Quality Inn bed we stayed in on our return home was vastly superior. We didn't mind the loud dance music pumping out of the pool area all day, but the room came complete with a weird, annoying droning sound at night when all was quiet, like an electric can opener being operated in the room above us intermittently, on for 20 seconds, off for 5 seconds all night long. Overall, the room and facilities just looked and felt a bit tired. There is a very apparent lack of care and attention to detail here. Also, we ended up not caring for the off-strip location at all: we spent a lot of transportation money on Uber because public transportation wasn't viable from the hotel, and the hotel shuttle to the strip operates very limited hours. 

Through all the negativity, there were a few redeeming qualities to this place. Walking around to discover all the cool band memorabilia was great. Also, the restaurants seemed pretty good - we had some good meals at Culinary Dropout and Pink Taco. More importantly, when we approached the front desk about the issues we'd found, the agent actually seemed to care about the issues we'd been having and offered to refund the resort fees and the initial room upgrade charge. The refunds haven't hit my account yet, so that promise remains to be seen. Still, it would have been far superior service to just comp us the upgrade in the first place instead of extorting us right when we stepped through the door. 

The million dollar question: would we come back? The answer: absolutely not. Between the room extortion insanity, rock hard bed, off the strip location, lack of attention to detail, erasure of first-time mystique, and tired atmosphere, there is simply no reason to. I'd vastly rather stay at just about any major chain hotel out there and save money instead of the Hard Rock.

We got in line and didn't move for 5 minutes, got cut off a few times, and ultimately decided to go into the parking structure instead. The first few floors were crazy, but the 6th floor was nice and empty, so parking ultimately wasn't too bad.

Time for check-in. We received an e-mail earlier in the morning that said we could do early check-in for an additional fee, but declined and took our chances and tried checking in at 1 instead of 3. We got in line, waited for about 20 minutes, and were told that our suite was not ready quite yet. No biggie, since we were a bit early, there were a ton of people, and it was a holiday weekend. We were told to check back in 30-45 minutes.

Went back at around 1:45-2, and were told that the room was still not ready and to give them about another hour. Okay, so maybe were were a little ambitious, so we decided to go back at 3, which was the standard check-in time. 

We decided to have some drinks at the bar near check-in and do some exploring while we waited. The bar was nice, drinks were good, and enjoyed looking at the memorabilia displayed throughout the hotel.

3:00 rolls in and we try again, for the third time. Wait in line again, and are told that the room is still not ready and to come back between 4 and 5!. My friends and I are now getting impatient, and wish the front desk would have just told us a realistic return time instead of having to go back so many times...and check in was supposed to be at 3!! ""Ok, FINE"", we're all thinking, ""let's go to the pool"". 

We finally decide to check our things in and go to the pool. So nice! there are a few different pools to choose from, beach pool that has sand in it, DJ, and tables for beer pong. We grabbed a bucket of shock tops, and my boyfriend paid $15 for a bottle of water (ridiculous). It's now 4:30 and we all just want to go to the room and get settled in. We find our other friend at a cool bar inside the hotel (with a sweet chandelier made of chains) and the bar tender there made us some drinks while we decided what to do next. He was so nice and we regretted not getting his name!

Finally, at 4:30, 2 of my friends decide to go back and try checking us in (for the 4th time), where they are told, AGAIN, that the room is still not ready. This time, the concierge was being really rude to them and to another party who was going through the same problem. I understand that it was a crazy weekend and he had probably been hounded on by other customers, but we were being nice and understanding (i mean, come on, after waiting for almost 4 hours) and to be disrespected by an employee representing Hard Rock was now the icing on the cake, the deciding factor that we would probably never be back. We then asked to speak to the manager, and the rude concierge said something like ""so you want me to pull him away from another customer just so he can talk to you?"" Shocked and feeling like this must be some kind of joke, we said yes. One of the managers finally came to talk to us and was able to help us out. We told him the situation and said that while we understood it was a busy weekend, we felt like we were being understanding and that the concierge really just sent us over the edge. He apologized and thanked us for our patience (since some other customers were yelling and cussing in the lobby out of frustration) and agreed to get us into the Body English nightclub with 5 free drinks and a $50 comp to our room. Finally, we get to go to our suite!

Sunday comes along and it's a disaster to get into the pool area. We go to the 2nd floor to get in, and the security guards say ""you either have to go back to your room or downstairs"" rudely and without explanation. We get sent around to 4 different areas, and each time, the security guards would tell us something different. We just wanted to go swimming in the regular pool :( Our friends got in but couldn't take their bags because it was ""too big"" (didn't see a sign and were not told about bag regulations) AND we saw 2 other girls get in with their own alcohol. There was a HUGE line to get to the pools, and heard there was some sort of stampede of people at one point because of a fight or something. Someone in the elevator told us that some girls had waited 4 hours to get in and got kicked out shortly after. After about an hour or two of being given the run around, we finally get in. The pool was nice but we are all just so over it and regretting not having stayed at our regular hotel.

Overall, staying at Hard Rock was a mistake. I know it was a holiday weekend, but things were so unorganized and chaotic, it was incredible. The staff just seemed unprepared and rude, and our party felt ripped off for having paid almost a grand for our suite (which may not be a lot, but it is to us!). It was nice of the manager to get us into the club with free drinks, but we were never given that $50 comp to our room. We will not be back.",4,2,1

The decor is kind of goth meets Vegas. The bathroom had double sinks and a huge shower with a rain shower head. Our room had a great view and overlooked the pool. The best part of the room was the bed. It was a big puffy white marshmallow of luscious sleepy dreaminess. I had the best night's sleep I have ever had in a Vegas hotel in that amazing bed.

Checking in was a breeze and the desk clerk was friendly, efficient, and customer focused. The gift shop has a great selection of micro brews for $2.50 a bottle including Dogfish 60 minute IPA and Full Sail IPA...which made me a very happy camper!

Our only disappointment came when trying to eat in the hotel. Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 supposedly has a $9.99 AYCE prime rib dinner, but the two days in a row we tried to order it we were told they were out of prime rib. We asked for the manager who made excuses (none of which seemed valid or even plausible) and on top of everything was a serious unaccommodating jerk.

Since they have remodeled the casino, it's also freshened up the entire place.  The food here at HRH is also amazing.  

For you sushi fans, you can't go wrong with NOBU.  Pink Taco will take care of any of your mexican cravings, and Lucky's will solve any 24 hour craving you may have.  

As far as gambling goes, I have always done well here.  Multiple hand pays, and the video poker machines have always paid well.

Where this hotel falls short is the way they treat their players.  Their players club is an absolute joke, and the hosts are very rude and inconsiderate.  They treat their players like total shit.  Their comps are a joke and getting anything comped is always a chore unless you've lost 5 figures.  For this reason, I will not stay here anymore.

Lots of other options closer to the strip and in the middle of everything.",7,0,0

We stayed in the Stones Penthouse Suite and a friend of ours stayed in one of the pool villas - both were unique in their own ways - and very, VERY cool.  

You can't find other suites like these in Las Vegas.  In my opinion, the luxury standard has gotten some of the strip resorts caught up in buying ikea-quality furniture made to look fancy - I don't like it.  However, Hard Rock, keeps it real.  The Stones Penthouse Suite (look at the photos I posted) is fit for a rocker, or just anyone who wants to feel like they're on a serious FUN Vegas vacation.  High ceilings, crystal lights, on-queue music upon entering, massive 60inch+ televisions, oh yah.... the list goes on.  Probably one of the best suites to host a party in. 

Our friend got a pool villa located on the second floor.  This suite featured a private outdoor courtyard, kinky artwork, and a path leading to a private pool (with cabanas) for all villa guests.  I felt like it was his own tropical hideout.  

Both suites were amazing in appearance.  The Stones Penthouse is FLAWLESS;  the furniture looked brand new, and the room was spotless.  I had to call the operator to ask for help with the massive television's remote control - this thing is no joke.  She was kind and helpful which I appreciated.  

I really hope to be back someday!!!

Note:  If you're debating staying here because it isn't on the strip - don't let that turn you away.  They have free shuttles that run all day.",4,1,4

Great music selection blasting out all day, gorgeous pool equipped with fake sand, so what if it's fake I still liked it. Nice clean rooms ( a bit on the dark side due to the red & black colour scheme) with a lovely big walk in shower. This place was a bit like the place to 'be seen' in with ample show off's etc but if you dismiss this it's actually quite a fun hotel with a young gorgeous tattood crowd prancing about everywhere.
The hotel is not near the strip and is a taxi ride away or the hotel provides a free shuttle service hourly to drop you on the strip.
The hotel itself swings either way as some of the party we were with hated everything about it so not everyone's cup of tea.

I have to say this is the first time I can't wait to check OUT. First we arrived and at check in, 2 people on front desk, clearly understaffed for the over 15 guests waiting in line. 
The atmosphere is pretty cool so we let the over 45 mins to check in slide.
We got our room, and some nights I like to stay in, order a movie, or in this case watch Game of Thrones. To my surprise neither was possible. Movie we ordered didnt work, they send a guy to fix it, ended up not working either. Other guy comes in, we could finish the movie a night later, only to find tv didnt work either on some channels. 
I have long hair, asked for an extra towel, they bring them just to have them taken away hours later by the cleaning service along with a couple of bags of snacks we left over the vanity. I still cant get over the fact they took my chocolates 
The the danger of all dangers, shower was broken, almost fell on my foot. Again, someone came and ""fixed"" it.  I take a shower, only to find water goes all our of the door through a gap that is supposed to be covered by some sort of plastic. Almost fell down on the freaking slippery floor. I tell the cleaning lady who was outside and she plainly tells me that they take the plastic out of the showers because it is so hard to clean and they better take it out. Who cares, right?
We leave the toom and ask them to come clean it, specially cause the floor is soaking wet, and when we come back the same soaked towel mat and slippery floor are waiting for us with a freshly made bed  
We still had a couple of nights left on our reservation so we went to try and talk to the manager to see what we could do about it, but he was too busy to come out and address our concerns. 
Too bad such a cool hotel has been the worst experience I have had in Vegas ever. 
Just as an FYI, we try to stay at different hotels here to try them all out, we have been to Venetian, Palazzo, NYNY, Polo Towers,Luxor, even Hooters and the Plaza amongst others and I have never ever had this bad service. We are changing hotels for the remaining of our trip here, but I don't want this to happen to anyone else specially on their vacations, cause it is not a cheap hotel and being so far from the strip, it MUST have a better service to charge what they charge. Many many better options by far less prices many on the strip. Very dissapointing. Hope they pay attention before someone injures themselves badly to the shower issues.",2,0,0

Hard Rock is about a 5 minute cab ride from the strip. Not too bad. The casino area is so yuck. Dim lights create that concert type feel which I don't have a problem with. However, the AIR... OMG. The cigarette smoke is the equivalent to LA smog during rush hour cramped into this itty bitty space. If I were ever to die from second hand I would blame it on my visit here. If everyone was smoking weed I'd have a contact high in like 3 seconds.

That was a huge turn off. They have a Pink Taco here, pretty cool, along with a starbucks and some cool little shops. Nothing really stands out if you're just planning to stop by and see what's going on.",3,2,2

1. Loud construction going on right now. Half the casino floor is gutted down so very few tables + slots available to play.

2. Limited access to pool. Okay so I was really excited to check out this hotel for their oh so popular paradise pool. checked in on a Sunday and they tell me there is no discounted price for hotel guests on cover charge for the beach party. What?? Ok... So I let that go. Decided to skip Rehab that day and decided to go next day.Came back the next day and half the paradise pool was closed and the breathe pool was also closed! So much for a pool experience 

3. Sports book staff were VERY disrespectful! Went to place a bet, and because ""their computer system is down"" they wouldn't verify and cash out my winnings. Their staff was very smug about the situation and gave no other explanation about how we could claim my money. That is just SAD for a casino.

4. 80% of the staff I dealt with were very rude. They were smug, defensive and have a ""Go figure it out yourself"" attitude. They look miserable and just a sad representation of the facility. A few of the security, the housekeeping staff, and bartenders at the pool were the only few who knew how to deal with customers. Everyone else was completely rude. Oh and they messed up one billing at the front desk! hah they got me on a good run around about what they were charging on my card after checkout and the best answer of one of the front desk staff was ""oh i don't know, maybe something went wrong?"" And shrugged. I had to go back an hour later at my frustration to deal with someone else who took care of the situation.

Overall besides the pool (which really Isn't all that great, I've seen better) and the restaurant ""culinary drop out"" this place should just close down because that's what they're heading for at this rate. 

I've never had such an  unpleasant hotel experience here in vegas! I've tried every hotel from Wynn, Palazzo, Ceasars (love) Bellagio, and even luxor, New York New York and the works...and this is my far the worst. 

I got upgraded to top floor of the ""newer"" paradise tower. It's a joke. My phone was broken for one, and not enough toiletries and towels were provided for TWO guests.

I feel like I've wasted my money on this place. NEVER AGAIN.

1.  The rooms in the HRH Tower were AMAZING..AMAZING. Be sure to ask for a higher floor though because we were on the 7th floor and we could hear and feel the thumping of Vanity Nightclub, nothing crazy but if you were on a lower floor it would be a problem.
2.  Out of all of the casinos we went to the cocktail waitresses at the Hardrock were the best and most efficient.  We were never without a drink.

Problems:
1.  On New Years Eve we went to the Bell Desk to arrange for a limo to take us to dinner that night.  We really weren't sure if it would be possible due to the time we made the request and the fact that it was NYE.  However, we were assured it wouldn't be a problem and to come down at 5:30 and our limo would be waiting.  We come down at 5:30...no limo.  The bell staff present had no clue about our limo.  Lucky enough (or so we thought) a limo pulled up to the HRH entrance to let guests off.  The Bell Staff was kind enough to arrange for us to take that limo.  We should have know we were in for an interesting ride when the limo driver started driving off when our party was still getting into the limo.  Nevertheless, we all got in and on our way we went.  About 5 minutes after we left the Hard Rock our limo driver informed us that he would need to drop us off at the Flamingo Hotel instead of Ceasars because he had an emergency.  Trying to be understanding, we agreed.  However, as we approached the limo driver got nervous because they started shutting down the Strip and he pulled off into a side street\/alley and made us get out..  So we walked in our party dresses and heals (it was freezing cold that night).

While I understand that the what the Limo Company does is not the problem of the Hard Rock, the whole problem started because the Bell Person didn't make the arrangements.

When I complained the next day the desk clerk looked at me with sheer horror on her face.  She was very kind and helpful and directed me to the right people for my complaint.  I got a call from the Head of the Bell Desk telling me that the person I spoke with wasn't actually a Bellman, but rather a limo concierge service (from my understanding not really employed by the Hard Rock) and thus I should call those people.  At this point I would like to point out that the person I spoke to was standing behind the Bell Desk, doing Bellman type things, was dressed EXACTLY LIKE A BELLMAN...but apparently, I should have known that he wasn't a Bellman.  Frankly, if you dress like a bellman, act like a bellman, and stand where a bellman stands (and the hotel knows this and condones this) your a freaking bellman and thus, the Hard Rock is responsible for your actions.  However, the Manager of the Bellmen simply passed the buck.  Thankfully, the manager of the front desk got back to me and gave us a $50 credit to our room, didn't offer one to the rest of our party even though they got stranded too.

2.  When we arrived at the Hard Rock it was still very early in terms of checking in, which we fully understood.  So they told us they would text us when our room was ready. Great, that is awesome...or so I thought.  We made ourselves busy, gambling and exploring.  Several hours later around 2pm we decided to check on the status of our room, no not ready yet and assured us we would get a text.  Finally 3:15 came around (check-in starts at 3pm) we decided to just double check on our room as we were really tired from traveling.  Sure enough our room was ready.  Thank god we asked about our room because we got a text at about 8:30 p.m. telling us our room was ready...oiee...thank god we didn't wait for that text to come (5 hours after check-in was supposed to start).

3.  When we originally booked the rooms, we put both room deposits on my card to make things a little easier.  We were assured that we could move one of the deposits to another card when everyone arrived at the hotel.  And so we did just that.  The front desk clerk assured us that the deposit I had made would be credited back to my credit card within 2 weeks, and the other person would be charged for the room deposit.  GREAT, easy enough.  Well, we got out final bill and everything seemed fine.  The other party got a bill for $550 with no explanation as to why it was so high...it was just that way.  2 weeks came and went...no credit.  Finally, I called and was told they had no record of our request and that the other party was charged only $354 instead of $550.  So after arguing with the person, they finally agreed to put the charges in the right card and credit me.  We shall see if this actually happens.  We are still confused why the Hard Rock's invoice said the other party would be charged $550...considering even now with the $133 charge put on their card they will now pay $484 (the correct amount for the rooms).

The couches were badly stained, some light switches do nothing, the iPod dock took a full day to load the information from my iPod, the TVs were so bad that we could not see anything when the back ground was dark (we had a movie refunded because of this), they charge $20 a day for a refrigerator, in a suite.  In the poker room you were lucky to find one table running, yet for some reason they think they should run 1\/3 games as if they are a popular destination.

We had a blast so just recently my fiancé and I decided to go back there to revisit some good memories. Well, after a pleasant LA to LV road trip, we were greeted to HRH telling us that they could check us in early and they would call us when our room was ready. They never called! We went back in that time frame and they said they couldn't check us in until 5 unless we wanted a smoking room. That is ridiculous to me, we had already paid and were promised an early check in. In addition to the fact that they make you pay a resort fee that includes basically nothing. Free internet which barely works. You have to pay extra to go to their pool; Rehab. $30 for girls and $50 for guys and that does not include anything except for admission.

For being located off the strip, no shopping, having to pay extra for everything and baring the chance to have your room not ready is not worth it.

The rooms here are good. If you come prior to check in even 30 minutes, you will wait in line only to find out your room is not ready. You then will have to wait in another line if you want your bags kept. They have not found a way to fix this. 75 people in lines with maybe 5 clerks and 2 bag drop guys. 

We booked a King Pool View Room which might be $25\/$30 more than a normal mountain view. When we finally did get a call that our room was ready we were already out. So we came back late 6pm or so. Waited in line again to get our key and off to the room we went, dog tired. I immediately wanted to see the Pool View only to see the roof and a mountain. 

I called the front desk and had to hang up and call back because I was on hold for literally 18 min. I explained that we were given the wrong room and the manager on the other end said ""you did not specify a room type"". I was furious because I am looking down at my iPad with my confirmation on it. ""King Pool View"" and I even booked the room directly from their website. Now, knowing that there is a difference in price for these two rooms, how could a manager flat out lie about the room type booked?  Would he\/she not know from simply looking at the price paid. I already pre-paid the first night to guarantee my room type. Then he tells me he has nothing available in the pool side. Awesome!

This review is for the hotel and the hotel only. Standing water in the shower, noisy hallways, uncomfortable bed and a regular that was just not take care. Levels me disappointed and cannot rate any higher than a 2.

Changed to a 1 - Upon checkout I had to speak to a manager (Evan) because what the manager told me about crediting us the difference in the rooms booked was NOT reflected on the bill.

They do have a shuttle that goes to the strip but it stops running at 5pm. My biggest complaint is about the rooms. Although the bed is very comfortable, the walls are SO THIN you can hear people talking in the hall. You could probably hear them whispering in the hall. Still, that's nothing compared to the airplane noise! You would think when a hotel locates themselves underneath the flight path of take off and landing, they would go the extra mile to sound proof the rooms, this is NOT the case. The TI on the other hand is VERY sound proof. There was also a septic smell that came from our bathroom periodically, which was sickening. Also, unlike the TI, they don't equip the room with a mini fridge, they give you a mini bar full of insanely expensive selections. The curtains attempt to block out the light but they still let some through. The TI has AMAZING black out curtains! Overall, I will never stay at the Hard Rock Hotel again.

Going back 4-5 years I used to frequent this hotel\/casino\/resort with some frequency.  I think it must be under new management or ownership or both, because while I used to enjoy and frequent this locale, it no longer will be someplace I come back to.  I go to vegas 5x a year.

1) New tower.  The rooms don't really seem any larger than the old rooms, and there are no closets (just wardrobes), and there is way too much dead space because of the size of the bathroom.  Nice look and feel but poor on the functionality.  Also the room sound system only worked 1 of the 5x I tried to use it.  The other 4x it said ""system temporarily unavailable while updating the system.""

2) There were massive design flaws in this upgraded ""tower"".  They didn't design in enough sound proofing for the walls and windows.  You can hear the pulsating music and base of the nightclub as you are trying to go to sleep at 230am, as well as the nocturnal activities of your next door neighbor.  The curtains don't ""black out"" the windows, so you are fighting the sun at 7am.  Come 830am the massive pool music system is up for sound check and running so you can't sleep because the room is shaking from the pool sound system.  I know what the HRH is known for, and I expect loud music but I expect to not have it destroy my ability to sleep.  At any hour.  Isn't that part of the vegas ""deal""?  Party hard and sleep in?

3) The whole pool set up has become ridiculous.  You have to wait 45-120 minutes in line to get your wrist band depending if it's a Sat\/Sun to go to the pool.  I don't pay 300+ a night to wait 2 hours to go to the pool.  And to pay 75 dollars as a hotel guest to go to the pool.  It used to be free for hotel guests to attend Rehab or some nominal charge, and the wrist bands were issued at the front desk at check in.  No crazy lines, no crazy expenses.  This is insane the way it's set up now.

4) Are you ready for this?  A pool chair now has a 100 dollar food and bev min.  For REHAB sunday that jumps to 500 dollars.  As a result, 85+ percent of the beach chairs were unoccupied and everyone was sitting on towels draped over concrete.  Somehow I don't feel I should be forced into choosing between being extorted or sitting on concrete given the Rack Rates at the HRH.  I would obviously have skipped waiting in line 90 minutes plus paying 75 dollars as a hotel guest if anywhere it was mentioned on the web site or marketing materials that a chair was 500 min food and bev.  I would have saved my time and money and done something else.  Wasting time is one thing, wasting money is another, and wasting both is inexcusable

5). Really cheap on the comps.  Look, I don't play 5-10 dollar hands, and I don't play for 15 minutes.  I play hours a day at a respectable average bet.  Most casinos vie for my business and it's reflected in the sizable comps.   The comp rate here is as bad as the Venetian \/Wynn.  And with much fewer rollers or high rollers.  And not a whale in sight.  How does this make any sense?

HRH, I like your scene, and I like your brand, but you really must fix these items to get another dollar of my money...  As usual Lucky's Diner was great, but that wasn't enough to save the experience!",15,7,7

The bathroom is nice and it has a jacuzzi. Room service is incredibly fast. I have never ordered room service in Vegas and gotten it in less than an hour (an hour is actually pretty good). The meal I ordered at HR got to my room in 20 minutes.

The pool, Rehab, is set up to look like a beach with sand and free lounge chairs. Other casinos (Planet Hollywood) make you rent a daybed or cabana. Hard Rock does it for free. The pool also has a lazy river, a water slide and swim up blackjack. The cocktail waitresses are all really hot and they come by as frequently as you need them.

The casino has all the same stuff you will find everywhere else - blackjack, craps, roulette, slots, baccarat, war, all of those Asian games like Pai Gow and three card poker. The minimum bets here are lower than the casinos on the strip.

Be sure to check out Pink Taco. The food is outstanding. They also have a tattoo shop, so don't get too drunk or not everything that happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas.",3,0,0

The Good- stayed mid week (wed-fri w living social deal) and upgraded to the new HRH Tower which is a must if you want a nicer experience. Check in was easy. 
Room was fantastic! 10th floor view of pool and strip and totally sound proof! 
Cool audio system in the room for playing music. GIANT bathroom and shower. Beds were super comfortable. 
The HRH Tower is nicer and more chill than the others and even the pool is more mellow which we liked. Crazy town pool just on the other side for easy access. 
Easy to grab a taxi to the strip for $10. 
Pink Taco was solid for lunch and we sat pool side. 
Fitness center and wifi included in the resort charge of $18\/day. Both were good.  

Not-so-good- Need taxi to get to strip so factor that in. Housekeeping wasn't very thorough, ice machine didn't work on first day, etc. Minor irritations and the only thing that kept us from giving 5 stars. 
Take Home- Great stay at a great price but highly recommend the new HRH Tower if you want quality, other Towers if you want to just party. And of course, epic people watching at no extra charge!",1,1,1

- Decor is excellent, like the rest of the Hard Rock.
- Comfortable chairs
- In my experience during two tournaments, the dealers were friendly and knowledgeable (accurate), and also there were lots of inexperienced players (one didn't know you could check!)

Cons:

- Cheap playing cards (papery)
- Uncomfortable felt (hard, no ""give"")
- Tournament structure suffers from too many levels early, too few levels late

Personally, overall I would much rather play poker elsewhere until they get some reasonable quality cards and felts.  This is a peeve of mine in poker rooms.",0,1,0

Once I seen the dirty toilet, I called front desk to ask for a new room. Unfortunately, at the time I arrived, HRH could not accommodate my needs. They offered to have my room serviced.  I was fine with that, and decided after my trip I would contact the Hard Rock to follow up on the cleanliness and my poor view that I paid extra for. I ended up staying an extra night and booked a room in the  Casino Towers. I found trash in the bathroom around the toilet.

I got home and contacted customer service. A rep Janice contact me and apologized for the trouble.She offered me to come back with a discounted rate. I was disappointed to find out I would have to pay the same amount of money to stay there again. I advise her the figures she provided were no discount as it was what I paid last time.

Got a Groupon for a 2-night weekday stay $41\/n. Seems cheap but of course, the friggin place charges $22 resort fees per night so it ends up being regular price that you could get at another hotel on the strip on weeknights. Booo. 

Pros:
- Standard Tower King room is spacious. 
- Can open windows for fresh air into room
- Soft bed and pillows


Cons: 
- Resort fee $22\/n (boooo!)
- No bathroom fan anywhere in any room in the entire hotel! You better just suck it up with the smells! 
- Either lights by the TV didn't work or they didn't have any switch to turn them on. We kept searching and did not find any way to turn them on. We called front desk and they said they were going to send someone to take a look. No one came. Great customer service!
- The TV remote didn't work! I keep pressing the Power button and pointing it from all directions towards the TV and...NOTHING. You'd think there's an alternative way on the TV itself to turn it on manually...NOTHING. The hell?
- Room looks a bit worn out.
- We requested for mountain view, but we got this crappy view with the mountains far far away and instead we were looking straight down to walls and pipes. So romantic.

I will NOT stay here again. It never crosses my mind to stay here - only because of the Groupon. It's off the strip (about a mile or so) so there's no convenience whatsoever. For this they should step up their game in making the stay as comfortable as possible for guests.",1,0,0

We ordered 2 beers.   $24.  Short pours, too. They were craft beers,  good,  but no reason for them to be that expensive.    Lesson learned,   be sure to ask for drink pricing before accepting your drink.   The HR is totally taking advantage of customers by leveraging the American custom of ordering a drink without confirming the price when the custom is based upon the premise that drinks and cocktails are a reasonable price in an establishment.  I didn't see anything else special about this place except the rock and roll themed video slots.  This place is off the strip and a long way to get there do you will have to drive or take a cab or bus. .   But they may have good room rates and you could have a good time there.

I was in las Vegas on business for a total of 5 nights.   I stayed in the casino tower.   My view was great.  My bed was comfortable & I was very happy to have a door that opened to a ledge so that I could let fresh air in.  

Everything was fine up until Friday night.  There was a special event being held at their club, Vanity.  I was in bed by 11 since I had to work at 8:30 the next morning.  Around midnight I wake up to the sound of music blasting & a DJ's voice yelling on a microphone.  Had I had earplugs with me, I don't think it would have helped because it was so unbelievably loud.  By 2:00 am I was on the verge of tears because I was so tired.  I called the front desk to find out when it would end.  The person who answered my call had a very, ""you're S.O.L. attitude"".  He told me. There was an event & I basically had to deal with it until 3:00am when it would stop.  I just can't wrap my head around the fact that this hotel expects its guests to put up with this.

by Myke R.

Why I like the Hard Rock Hotel is because girls here are pretty. When I come here I feel pretty because boys are emo and emo boys are supposed to be cool. But I can beat up emo kids because they like to cry. I like to pull emo kids hairs. Hard Rock has a small casino. It is round shaped. I never win here. But I like to play. Bam Margera had a bachelor party here and he got messed up. That night I won 300 dollars. I was not messed up but Bam was. I like the pool here. There are lots of pretty girls who are easy and wear thongs. You can see them on hardrockhotel.com at the pool cam. Some of them are sluts. That's ok because sluts are people too. The pool is very very nice. It has sand. We have rehab in summers. But I work. So I never get to go. But the pool is big and you can see it online. It smells good. I like Mr Lucky's 7.77 special with steak and shrimp. It tastes good. 
I also like Simon's Kitchen. It's good too. Love Jones gets me feeling special in my ""down there"". Pink Taco is good too. But it's boring. I like looking at pink taco. There's lots to look at. You guys are dirty.

I have a few complaints about the bathroom: 1. no fan (at least no working fan - the ones you can hear), 2. the drain was not working in the shower, and 3. no hairdryer (had to call to have one brought up). 

It's a fun casino and there are a lot of things to see and do, but after staying at a few other places in Vegas, I definitely need something ON the strip. It just got to be too expensive to bounce back and forth from HR and the rest of the other casinos.",2,1,2

Don't get me wrong, I dig this hotel. But there's something about seeing young women throw up on the casino floor, or, get carried out of shows like a sack of potatoes, that is not very appealing to me.  C'mon ladies keep it together!

You know why people are so sloppy at night though?  Because the pool is crazy.  And, it's crazy in a good way.  They play good music and the crowd is young and fun and everyone is just there to have a good time.  And, when you spend 6 hours in 100 degree heat drinking one alcoholic beverage after another, your gonna be pretty sloppy come nighttime.

The BEDS!  Omg, probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have EVER slept in.  White fluffy soft goodness. Heaven in a bed. If you get lucky enough to have a pool view the patio (not that you can really walk out on one at all) is cute entertaining.

A few things I noticed about the hotel that didn't match to my last time:
-No music in the elevators?
-No music under the water in the pool?
-A\/C in room had a cover that kept falling off - annoying
-Drain in room also made mystery burping noise

I checked out Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 (in hotel cafe open 24 hours!), the joint (inside concert venue) for the chelsea handler show, rare 120 (the new in hotel steakhouse) and body english (the hotel club).  All were VERY good and deserve their own reviews - but overall ALL the perks to this hotel rock... no pun intended.

We stayed in the HRH all suite tower. We arrived around 9 p.m. at the HRH entrance and were immediately greeted by the always helpful and eager staff. At check-in they even assisted in getting the wife's electric scooter, which is kept at the main entrance.

We were given a room on the 11th floor. The room smelt clean, the a\/c was on and all the lights and tv's (2) worked . I called  for our bags and a little fridge for our meds. The bags arrived in a few minutes and the fridge within 15 mins. 

We stayed for 3 nights and four days. The food was great. The room service is always top notch. There is nothing better than sitting at the bar at Pink Taco snacking  on guacamole and chips playing video poker on a hot summer day. Or getting up early and relaxing poolside before the crowd arrives. This is a rock'n roll hotel, there will always be a little noise and loud music. During the summer the Rehab beach party plays loud pulsating music. But it ends early so you can get a good nights rest. 

With the addition of MB steakhouse, Dunkin Doughnuts, the Oyster Bar and the new and improved Fuel Café, you never have to leave the casino. It's nice to just rest in the clean room and rest. You can watch either the TV facing the bed or the one facing the couches. After a long day the extra deep and oversized tub is always welcome. The Wi-Fi is easy to connect to. 

It was a perfect vacation. No complaints at all. The service is great and the place has only gotten bigger and better over the years. The saddest part is always leaving. But we are planning to come back soon. I already booked a few days in September to see a show I have been wanting to see.  The Hard Rock is the best.

Naturally, since there are no signs posted anywhere, I ask him why. He says this is the VIP section in an obvious degrading tone. He then stood to the side and watched us while we dried off and left the area, as if we would go on strike or vandalize things. Nonetheless, I mentioned to him that there might be something wrong with the tub as the temperature is off. He looked at me with pursed lips and shook his head. What the hell??

We jammed, being able to change in the restrooms without a security escort, and won't be back.",5,0,0

Since I was staying just one night, I got bumped up to a suite! Sweet! The room was a lot more than I needed, but I wasn't complaining. Just cursing myself for being single. The room would have been just freakin' awesome for, well, you know. It was built to have some ""fun."" They even have some items at the honor bar to assist you. 

The bed was really comfy.

The bathroom was huge. Especially the shower. Enough room for two... or three people. 

There were two flat screen TVs. 

The living room (?) had a huge 20x24 photo of Little Richard that I found very disturbing. I didn't want him looking over me. 

I had a great view of the pool area, which would have been like glimpsing into Heaven if it wasn't 50 degrees and windy.

Internet is extra. 

Checking in was easy and the staff was half the age of Circus Circus'.

Next time I stay in Vegas, I will definitely spend more on a hotel room. Hard Rock's didn't have the stench that Circus Circus did and didn't have what sounded like an animal running around in the room above.",2,4,1

couple of notes:

- I wanted to take the bedding home, it was amazing! I seriously was about to leave all my clothes there and stuff the duvet in my luggage.
- We stayed in the Paradise Tower. It was nice and modern, but the decor was kinda dark, it was hard to do makeup with the full length mirrors (something important when 4 girls are staying in one room!) One thing though was that our room overlooked the pool and the music was really loud during the day so that was kinda meh. We were playing our own music, so it was like whatever, but just might be something to know.
- The pool is awesome. We went to the pool the day before Rehab officially opened and it was fun to hear all the music and their watermelon mojito was so yummy! Water was coldddd though, but I was able to get my dark tan on.
- It is a bit off the strip, but I didn't mind. I've been to Vegas enough times to not need to explore the strip so much.
- They were really accommodating and was able to find 2 rooms that was adjoining for my group of girls.
- I gambled $20 at roulette and lost. I wish the big baller that came to the table with $1k sharsies with me. lol Pay to play people. Pay to play.
- Also enjoyed the Spa Services there: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/reliquary-spa-at-the-hard-rock-hotel-tower-las-vegas#hrid:QKgCT_MLzJBvW63K-H54NA

at check in (we arrived at 11 am)..they let us check in immediately for $20.  That kinda sucks since i figure if they have rooms ready they should just let us check in instead of nickle and diming us...oh well..we got into our room and got ready for our pool party at the MGM. 

room was fine...view of the pool...beds were comfy...badroom was nice.. rooms could have been cleaner (particles on the ground, major dust around the vents and I would not have touched that phone.

they have free wifi and free calls...which i didn't use either...it was really just a place to sleep.

we went to the lobby bar twice...first time had a fabulous drink..second time the same drink was quite bleh...and i noticed that the girl used some other vodka instead of the grey goose i had requested...she insisted she used grey goose but that's not what i saw with my own eyes.  we left our drinks at the counter and walked away.  

so at 6 am when we walked into the room...the vent from the AC unit had fallen all over our suitcases! omg! we were incabable of doing anything at the time and went to sleep.

talked to management after we woke up and they offered to upgrade us to a suite..but we booked and earlier flight and decided to go home...
they couldn't refund since we booked through a 3rd party...so they said they would email us a voucher for a future stay...haven't received it yet...we will see.

The hotel is clean, small, but not too small, and draws in the fun, young crowd. Good.  I like it.  The rockers stay here, and the dealers are usually very friendly.

Then there's this:

On Monday, I checked in to the Hard Rock for a business trip.  I was working until dinner time, then doing some follow up computer work in my room that night.  In preparation for this, I bought a 12 back of bud light for my co-worker and I while we worked.  As I'm walking past the security guard who stands by the elevators, I am stopped.  He tells me that outside alcohol can not be brought into the rooms.  

WHAT.  THE.  FUCK.  Where am I, Salt Lake City?

Here are my issues with this:

1.  This obviously isn't meant to keep alcohol out of the rooms.  There's a freaking mini-bar in the room.  It's clearly meant to force guests to pay inflated prices for alcohol.

2.  It wasn't like I was bringing a massive amount of booze up.  It was 12 beers for 2 guys over two days.  If anything, they should have suggested I buy more.

3.  Whose business is it what I take to and from my room?  Last time I checked, I paid so that I could have a private room, to do anything that I want, within the scope of the laws of Nevada (so basically anything).  Why is a hotel checking to see what I am doing in my room?  Bullshit if you ask me.

4.  Its embarrassing to be stopped by security, especially when they are acting like a strict grandparent.

5.  What's next?  No outside cigarettes?  No outside food?  No outside hookers?  Its a slippery slope, and I'm not letting it happen.  Remember how we gave Hitler Poland?

Bye bye Hard Rock hotel.  Until you concern yourselves with something other than where I purchased my beer, I'm going to stay elsewhere.

 Some of the staff is just obnoxiously rude.I get it,you work around drunken reprobates and it get's under your skin. So,since you didn't achieve beyond 800 combined on your SAT scores , you probably don't have many other options,especially with your ugly tatts and makeup.

Here starts my Bitch rant....

Well, this is the LAST time we stay at a hotel based on theme!!!! My friends and I always wanted to stay here because it always looked so hip and being music fans, all the memorabilia intrigued us. We got a great deal so we jumped on it. Little did I know the great deal was because this place and the service sucks BALLS!
Check in was fairly easy. Deposit was 50 per night which I haven't had at other places but whatever. We came into a hot room. A\/C barely worked. No trash can in the bathroom. Who ever cleaned this room was in a rush or just didn't give a rats because she\/he over looked the bobby pins and hair clips and boogers on the wall. Boogers you say? Yes we had a Fucking BOOGER collection started off on our wall that some half drunk broski in his two sizes two small affliction shirt must have started on his stay previous to ours. Gross. Toilet paper was almost gone, barely any toiletries. Who fixed our room up? Did anyone at all? Sheesh! 

It took 3 calls for them to fix our AC and it didn't get fixed I called at midnight on our second night asking when someone was going to come up and fix our damn ac. Which after the fix, didn't really do much. We still were super hot. Time to sleep in our chonies I guess!

Check out was a nightmare. We were supposed to be comped out rollaway bed for our troubles and I ended up gettin charged for it plus our deposit and I'm still trying to get that resolved. You would think I would get a free night considering we slept in a sauna but whatever. Of course my extra charges like room service was billed But the credits weren't given back. The front desk can't take care of it, because they are all derp derps... you have to call a different number of course which I'm sure being hundreds of miles away is going to be a pain in the ass. When I finally got a hold of Accounting, the lady was a total CU next tuesday when I explained the situation. Im still waiting on the credits to be refunded. Its been a week. I will call again until I get my money back. 

They realllllly don't want me to get nasty on the phone. 

Other than that, the drinks are redic expensive, the beer wenches who fetch you your drinks while you gamble take forever to bring you your drinks if you can even find them.

My friends often ask me: ""How do you do it?""
This generally takes me by surprise and I reply: ""Do what???""
Their responses go something like this:
A. ""How do you go to Vegas 6-8 times a year and you're still alive?""
B. ""How did you party with all of us until 4am and now it's 9am and you're driving to wine country for the day? WTF?!?!""
C. ""I want tacos\/In-n-Out\/Jack in the Box... How are you still drinking?""
D. ""How do you do YOU??? I want your stamina!""

I really only have an answer to A: The HRH Tower Suites! The newest addition tower in the building that houses suites exclusively. They range from small, standard hotel-style bedroom suites with a regular shower & sink bathroom to bigger suites that have a large living room\/bedroom divided by a dual-sided flat screen TV enclosure and a bathroom with a giant walk-in shower (wall shower heads and over-head waterfall shower head options) and an enormous bath tub that can fit two very tall human beings easily. The top floor also holds the ""baller suites"" that have their own outdoor roof top pools and God knows what else. One day, Anna, one day... 

The HRH suites make me survive Vegas. I can regain energy in the amazing shower, in the large, insanely comfortable King-sized bed, on the big couch, or via a soak in the tub. The suite decor is sleek, sexy, and modern. Large frames housing concert posters or legendary portrait shots of famous singers add the traditional Hard Rock touch. 

If you are rated at the Hard Rock (i.e. gamble a lot and spend tons of money in the establishment's restaurants), you get free rides to anywhere on the strip or to the airport in their exclusive black SUV limos. The drivers are all super nice, as is the rest of the staff at the Hard Rock Hotel.

The Nirvana and Rehab pool areas offer the best of both worlds - chillaxing or going wild. Night club Vanity and concert venue The Joint assure that there's not a boring night in the Hard Rock Hotel. Restaurants like Mr. Lucky's 24-7, 35 Steaks & Martinis, Nobu, and Pink Taco assure that you can fuel up at any time. 

Recently the Sports Book was renovated and is now a lot bigger than it used to be. The Poker Room here still kind of lacks compared to other casino hotels as it gets little traction and not too many tournaments are scheduled. 

The HRH Tower Suites are the reason why I can go hard for a while and then I can go home. I'll be back soon!",16,14,14

This might not be the top of the line for most people, but I had an amazing experience from booking my room until we picked our bags up on our last day. This was certainly the best place I could have stayed for my first time in Vegas! 

Some of these pros and cons will be subjective depending on what kind of experience you're looking for.

Pros: 
-Exceptional customer service. We had previously booked a room through Travelocity and were placed in a king room despite us needing two queens. After some back and forth with Travelocity and having them unable to guarantee we'd receive the correct number of beds, I called the hotel directly and they were able to get us a MUCH better rate. We had originally booked for $350 for a Monday-Thursday stay, the hotel gave us a rate of $274. When we arrived to check in (around 8pm on Monday) we were in and out quickly and upgraded to a suite! Everyone was so helpful during our stay and so nice about it. 
-The suite was by far the nicest room I've ever stayed in. We had a wet bar by the door with two closets and a huge bathroom. My friend and I could get ready right next to each other without feeling on top of one another. There's even an adjustable magnifying mirror for makeup. The shower was huge with a rain water head and a separate, removable shower head. The bathtub though was the crown jewel. I'm 5'10, so I've never been able to completely submerge myself in a tub before. I ended up taking a bath every night we were there! 
-The resort is smaller and off the strip which is what I prefer. I liked that it didn't have a whole mall section to it and that there weren't a ton of people wandering in from other resorts so you're not overwhelmed by too many people.
-There are four pools but only two were open when we lounged one day. Of the four, only one is kid friendly, the rest are 21 and up so you don't have to deal with rowdy children when you want to catch some sun and relax.
-If you sign up for a player's rewards card, you can get a steak dinner at Mr. Lucky's, the 24\/7 diner, for $7.77. 
-You can check your bags with the bellmen if you have a late flight on the day you leave.
-The hotel and casino smell AMAZING! If the smokers aren't out in droves, the casino has one of those signature scents that I just couldn't get enough of. I would have bought a candle with that smell in bulk.
-They have free wi-fi which was good because Vegas doesn't have the best cell service. 

Cons:
-The carpet in the suite was pretty stained in the living area, but I didn't really care that much about it.
-The poolside drinks are ridiculously overpriced. We got two 12oz mixed drinks and it ended up being $37.
-The pools can get pretty crowded, so you're at the mercy of dealing with other people who think that because they have a cabana, they can rule the small pool area with their music and obnoxiousness. That's not a flaw of the hotel, but as always in Vegas, be prepared to deal with douchebags.
-Mr. Lucky's doesn't have a great breakfast cocktail special. They do a bogo so two mimosas sets you back $15. We'd previously gone to a buffet with a Groupon for bottomless mimosas for $18, so there are definitely better deals unless you're at the mercy of your friend who gets annoyingly hangry in the morning and thinks that taking a Lyft to another casino will take too long to get food into her. What can you do?
-The Lyft\/Uber pickup is near the Paradise Tower which is pretty far from the main part of the hotel.

Rock-n-Roll + Las Vegas Casino  = happy Annie P. 

My girlfriend and I came all the way out to vegas just to see the Pixies who played the Joint at the Hard Rock Las Vegas. Upon entering we were greeted with loads of really impressive memorabilia surrounding the casino. We grabbed a couple of reasonably priced drinks from a very friendly bartender and walked around the casino and ended up hanging out near the moonlit pool outside where we had a few quiet moments alone before heading back in for the concert. 

The JOINT was so easy to get into, the show was pretty packed but not once did we stand in line for tickets, for drinks or even to buy merchandise at the end of the show. The stage is HUGE and if you have floor tickets its not a problem to get as close to the stage as you like if you have the persistence. The bathrooms were clean, the sound quality of the show was excellent and I had a complete blast at this concert. 

Cool things to mention about the Hard Rock Las Vegas: 
- Elvis memorabilia!! 
- Snake skin seats at all of the slot machines!

I'm giving 4 stars because the rooms are just too dang expensive. We got a suite at the Golden Nugget for the same price of their standard room here on a Saturday night. It's about a $20 cab ride each way from Fremont Street to this hotel that is about a mile in from the strip.",0,0,1

A lot really seems to depend on your luck of the draw here.  As it happens, we got really lucky with our stay, and it turned out to be a great experience.  

We showed up after midnight on a Sunday night.  All of the rooms with a king bed were booked, so we got bumped up to a suite in the HRH Tower.  This was a GIANT upgrade considering we only paid $37 a night for the room.  I probably wouldn't think as much of the place if we didn't get that upgrade.  Sure, you still have to pay a $22 resort fee, which is silly, but every place in Vegas charges this now, so it is hard to knock Hard Rock for this.  So, we still only paid $59 a night for a very nice suite.  

With the HRH Tower, you get your own check-in and concierge area, which is much quieter and faster than the main one.  You also get your own garage, which was very fast in and out, free parking.  The suite had two big wardrobes and a wetbar when you walk in.  Then a living room area with a big sectional, its own TV and desk area. Then you walk into the bedroom, spacious with EXTREMELY comfy beds.  I think I need one of these at home!  The view looked out to the parking garage, but if you looked to the side there was a pretty good view of the south end of the Strip from MGM down to Mandalay.  Finally, the bathroom was excellent - separate toilet nook, huge shower with overhead shower available, and a large soaking tub.  We never heard any noise from anyone else while we were in the room, even though we definitely heard people playing music in their rooms as we walked through the hallway, so we got great sleep here. Speaking of which, we did enjoy having a selection of rock music to play in the room on their sound system.

We got lucky and had some nice hits at the slots in the casino, and also played the roulette and craps tables.  The casino was very popular at night here.  We also went to Nobu and Pink Taco.  Nobu just to try appetizers at the bar - main meals were very expensive, but I enjoyed the sushi.  Pink Taco was actually very reasonably priced.  I had lobster tacos and my wife had the chicken fajitas.  Both came with good sized portions and were tasty.  Try the queso for an appetizer, as long as you like chorizo mixed in, it was very good.  I would recommend anyone to try Pink Taco here.  Wait, what?

We checked out the party pool, it was pretty popular for being still in March.  A young crowd there, they have DJs on stage, bars set up, the whole thing.  So we got to have a ""club"" experience without going through all the nightclub BS.  Keep in mind you have to pay to rent a daybed or cabana like you would a table at a nightclub.  So we just sat on the beach area and on the side of the pool like most of the people.  To get away for a bit, we went up to the little ""Breathe"" pool.  This is a SMALL pool though, so it got crowded, you can't really swim around in it too much.  There is also a bar up there, good drinks but expensive at $16.  

The location is off the Strip, next to the UNLV campus.  So yes, I would definitely recommend having a car.  It was very easy to get in and out through the HRH garage.  They supposedly have a ""no outside food\/drink"" rule but no one hassled us or searched us for snacks, water, beers, etc.  Of course, we weren't hauling around cases or anything.  No fridge or microwave in the room, though.

Overall, the employees were very helpful and friendly here, got very good service.  At $59\/night for a suite, we got amazing value.",1,0,0

2) My internet did not work and I was on the phone to connect to front desk twice for 20 mins- i gave up. The phone finally did not work for some reason. 
3) the room does not have a refrigerator and outlets are not near bed. Only on one side far from bed. 
4) The employees in the pool are extremely rude. They might be good looking. Bartender looked very unhappy and had a bad vibe and charged me $16 for the worst margarita I had ever without a single drop of alcohol.

First off, this hotel and casino is located off the strip. I wouldn't suggest walking to the strip bc of the ridiculous heat but the Strip is a cheap Lyft drive away. We stayed for 5 nights and received great rates through Hotels.Com. Checking in wasn't until 4pm and the line was long but thankfully it moved quickly. We were upgraded to a poolside view but got 2 queen beds instead of a king.   Our room was in the Paradise tower and elevators do not function without a room card for security reasons.

The room we got was clean and spacious. No fridge and a walk in shower which I personally despise but not the end of the world. They have a little area that has some items you might need for your stay . Don't touch as there is a sensor and if moved, your credit card will be charged!  
AC worked like a charm bc the room was freezing! 

There are plenty of restaurants and shops downstairs for your convenience. And of course the casino. I didn't care much for the smoking but anything goes in Vegas! Also the Magic Mike Live show is held here too.   They also have a huge club at the pool called ""Rehab"". That was apparently the place to be as there was 3 days of scheduled concerts . So lots of Young guys and gals milling about the casino in their scantily clad beach wear . 
If you want a quiet , peaceful stay I don't know if this is the resort for you. We heard the concert at the pool from outside so if that stuff bothers you, you definitely wouldn't be happy. I would suggest checking upcoming events before booking maybe?

I do recommend walking around the casino and looking at all the rock and roll memorabilia displayed for your enjoyment from music greats from the past and present . Fascinating stuff!  

Overall, decent place to stay for us. No issues for the most part. Also parking here is free and self park . But there is an Uber\/ Lyft pickup area near the Paradise tower for your convenience. Also the hotel will hold your luggage at the bell hop stand if you check out and have a late flight.",7,2,4

I was on the Strip, just walking past Harley Café towards checking out Twin Peaks and I made a detour. On my first trip to Vegas there was a square frame of a structure being built at the intersection. By the end of my first 9 day trip, they were erecting a huge mockup of a motorcycle on the front corner of that I-beam frame.

Ages ago, it was common to make the Harmon pilgrimage to Hard Rock. Blocks into it, the big go to used to be The Drink. I remember once I got hammered there so much I woke up in a room at Town Hall ""with no idea how I got there."" I have a lot of Vegas drinking stories that end with that phrase, or pause for the morning after (\/of) part.

It was odd there weren't that many people making the walk. I remember it was crawling with people during summer at least, too cheap for a cab or needed to walk off booze. 

One of  the first times I went to Hard Rock, Morton still owned it. In their nightclub Baby's I met Vince Vaughn, hot off the success of Swingers. This was when we took pictures with film and we couldn't see if\/ how the picture turned out til after the trip, from the photo developers. And people only give you one real shot at a pic before people rotate or move on. And the one pic came out shitty.

From those first trips, there's always that one server I see at Mr. Lucky's 24\/7. The first time I asked her out was when the steak and shrimp special was less than $7 bucks, I think she told me about it when it was actually a secret. 

Finished many a drunken night\/ morning there. 

I was there for the Millennium. I saw Australia ring in the new century, the casino had a light show\/ celebration every hour that day & I think 'I ran in the first 3 time zones before meeting up with friends. 

On Halloween, a group of us guys used to go to Hard Rock to see the parade of ineffective bras not holding their cargo as women paraded around the circle of the casino dressed as Slutty [Vocation\/ animal].

I've seen many changes of the casino over the years. The new sections of the casino were almost empty and I didn't know if it was a surprise or not. 

Unfortunately, I didn't carry enough cash to get a pad of bills. I only know of one other casino that does it: Caesars. It's a cool Vegas-y gift for x-mas, I'm sure other casinos do it. 

Out front in the lot, I saw a couple of x-game competitions, some volleyball contests one summer and for x-mas they had a skating rink that I looked forward to. They even had brooms and I joined a pick up team and we broom balled until most of us were quite bruised and battered from playing. At least we beat one of the nightclub teams. 

I got to discover Rehab in it's second year, before the pool became the worst biological impact to the water table since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Go if you ever want to study the cross breeding of palm trees with bronzer and axe douche spray. 

Some of the biggest Vegas stories I experienced happened at Hard Rock. When Stern was on terrestrial radio, I hung out with a lot of the girls and pack when they broadcast for a couple of years. I think I finally saw old footage of those shows on the tube of you. I was also on the Carson Daly show taping the same week. That was the first time I ever, uh... Hey-ooo! I was a resident by the time Artie had the not dead incident and the other one at the Rhino, ooh another review! 

Probably the biggest story I have was the new years I shot craps and someone joined us at the table, Dennis Rodman. It was while he was still married to Carmen (who I'll meet in another review), and before he was blacklisted from some casinos from gambling debts. I don't think he made the Black Book, though? 

And that was why I went this time. I had to see the table again, even though they moved it. I could tell, the table has an identifiable mark I memorized. 

Would you ever think of bringing a camera when you go out drinking at home? Or expect to have a profit more than you made at work that week? Or the excitement of seeing any number of celebrities, not just one? 

It's why I moved to Vegas. It's why I draw inspiration from it. If you've ever done acid, it makes your skin feel the same, radiating heat and a frequency of color and electricity like a Tesla coil. It always ups your game to play with Champions.

Hard Rock is a very different animal, now. I am glad they added on and left the original parts us veterans can still hang out at. Too many casinos overhaul and force us into a whole new scheme that says adapt to new management or F you. But I got to party with HR in her earlier, wilder ""college"" days. And it was a good thing I stopped off, too. If I had gone to Twin Peaks any earlier, I would have missed out on another opportunity, the reason I hit the Strip...",4,5,4

A disgrace!
The rooms are dusty and dirty.  The housekeepers left the same dirty tissues on the floor each day.

I was here for my daughter's birthday with our whole family, and they wouldn't let me bring my camera to the pool because it looked too ""professional"", (yet you could bring pocket cameras in) so I couldn't get any photos of my family at the pool for 3 days.  I spoke to the manager about it and she said there was nothing she could do about it...it is clearly something they should tell you when you book your reservation.
 
They asked in we wanted a pool view or ""no view"", so we picked the pool view.  They failed to tell us we would hear blasting music from 9am through the wee hours of the night from the pool.

The sign when you enter the pool area lets you know immediately the kind of guests the hotel attracts! It says:
No weapons
No pills of any kind
No professional cameras or videos.

We have never stayed, but been in the Casino and all and really loved the vibe. I do like the small Casino, the Joint, Vinyl and many of the restaurants, but the rooms are only so-so.  

First, let me note that I did use miles to get a free room (Casino Tower - King Size Bed).  Nothing too fancy, just your basic room.  We were offered a $25\/night upgrade for Queen size bed with a pool view (which didn't seem like much of an upgrade) or a suite in the tower for $50\/night (that was a better room, but since we were in for long nights a suite didn't seem worth the money). So we declined the upgrades and got our booked room.  We did arrive early, but the room was not ready and was not available until 3p.  No biggie. We pre-registered (so we could just pick up keys) and they texted us when the room was ready (which was right on time). 

When we got to the room, it was nicely decorated, if not basic.  Big King bed,  good size TV, chair and a simple bathroom (shower\/tub combo, single sink and toilet).  We had a view of the roof with all the A\/C units (had to be the worst view in the place).  

The good: 
- Spacious room
- Very comfortable bed
- Was actually very quiet
- Decent size TV with lots of channels

The bad: 
- The cable on the TV went out several times and many channels just didn't come in at all.
- The bathroom smelled like rotten eggs or a sewer (GROSS), looked cleaned smelled terrible. 
- The shower had a nice rain shower head, but the drain backed up and couldn't keep up, so you ended up standing in ankle deep water during the shower.  
- Housekeeping was in the room next to us when we left at 11a, but knocked at our door at 5p to clean (after we had come back and were in for a nap), really annoying. We just got towels and they never came back, no maid service while there.  

So in short, the bad outweighed the good.  We weren't there long so it wasn't a terrible stay, we were out so much it didn't matter.  Still one would think they could get their sewer system and housekeeping in order, that isn't asking much.  I am not sure I would stay again. I certainly wouldn't stay in the Casino Tower.

We stayed in the HRH tower, which is a lovely newer tower with well appointed rooms. Check in was a breeze, though I did get there around 7:30 so it was not particularly busy anyway, but the first staff member I had an encounter with was excellent (I REALLY wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out, he was there at that time on 4\/20 and also at our checkout on that Sunday around 10PM). When I arrived the douchenozzles were in full force, and the young fella at the checkin counter was totally unphazed and very calm and funny. A good start. 

The room was a great size, and with some fun little extras (built in touchscreen jukebox, double sided tv, super comfy beds) but you could see where they began to cut corners on the details - I dont know what makes hotels think guests will not notice these things, they do stand out when surrounded by the nicer features. 

Food wise, we had some pretty good experiences. Pink Taco was low key and delicious and we splurged on a killer meal at the Steak and Martini place on Sunday, and had a meal we honestly thought was better than CUT (and every bit as expensive). Again, in both places, the service was excellent from host to waiter to bussers - friendly and knowledgeable. 

We spent a good deal of time at the pool - avoiding REHAB like the plague. We were very pleased to see there is a large section of the pool area (very large) that is seperate of the crazy pool party, and while there were plenty of kooks out, it was WAY more mellow, and service (once again) was fantastic. Really nice bartenders and cute servers with minimal attitude if any. In a place like that, if you are friendly and articulate and tip decently, you really get treated well. These guys and girls take SO much abuse every day, just being a decent human gets you fantastic service. 

The day we planned to leave we tried to get a late checkout, but it was not available - HOWEVER - for $99 they offered a whole extra day\/night - best Hundred ever spent. We slept in, got sun, had a nice meal, and left around 10pm when traffic was non existant, checkout was mellow (though there was some drunk idiotic girl in a ill-fitted bikini yelling at that same great staff member at the front desk while he calmly stood by and let her vent). 

The negatives were pretty mild - most of them revolving around the clientele and their need to become so wasted that they felt there would be no repercussions and no responsiblity for their actions - but the amusement we got from watching them was also a plus at times.... watching a fellow come out of his hotel room, make it about three feet, and then slide down the wall and pass out in the hallway was better than Cirque.

It is a little bit off the Strip, and the hotel is a little smaller then most of the Strip ones but that usually means cheaper room rates as well. I stayed in the casino tower, and although the hallways and decor was nothing to rave about, the actual room itself wasn't half bad. The bathroom was very basic, but the bed was huge and comfortable and I had a big LCD TV so no complaints!

They also offered me a voucher for a free 750ml of liquor at one of the stores, so that was nice as well!

Typical casino cliente is where it gets interesting! It's a little bit of an older crowd (think 30s, not many 20 year olds) but expect to see alot of Affliction and Ed Hardy type graphic tees around here. I wouldn't call it douchey, but like older dudes trying to act young. So that was hilarious.

Friendly dealers with usually an assortment of low and high minimum tables. Cab ride to Mcarran airport is only about $7 so it's dirt cheap! 

Personally, I can't see myself staying here for the whole duration of my Vegas vacation just because it's so far away from the Strip action, but if I was only going for Saturday\/Sunday, I'd give it a go.

Not sure where to post about the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Pool Complex when you're not actually talking specifically about Rehab, which is what you hear about the most so I'll post this here and on the page for the hotel.  But, the coolest thing about the Hard Rock Hotel Pool Complex is that during the week, you can use the pools for FREE!  Yup, I said free!

When we walked in there wasn't anyone around to direct us or check us or anything, so we just grabbed some towels and started wandering to see where we wanted to hang out.  The first thing we saw was the Rehab pool area and there was a DJ booth set up, the big pool and then a bar and swim up gaming that was not being used while we were there.  The pool continued on the other side and around the bar and on that side, there was a water slide.  I was happy about that as I love waterslides!  We wandered until we found a spot that had a little sun, but plenty of shade, too as the husband likes to stay in the shade.  We got settled in and after a little while decided it was time to take a dip. OH HELL NO!  The pool was so freaking cold I could not stay in it... we headed to the Jacuzzi to warm up and I knew there was no way I was hitting THAT waterslide.  The water was like ice water.  That would explain why so few people were in it.  I was pretty bummed, but we went back toour lounge chairs and did some reading.  Oh, by the way, near the DJ side of the pool there are VERY few chairs... if you want to sit, you need to rent the daybeds, etc. that are available, but as you head to the other side, you will find some chairs, but not many!

After we'd been there a couple of hours, we decided to go try the little pool near the top of the waterslide to see if it was warmer (it wasn't) and then we saw a sign for another pool, so started exploring.  What we found were more cabanas that are above the DJ area and another pool, Breathe.  Unfortunately, Breathe was closed so we couldn't even see it, but then we noticed just around another corner was the Nirvana pool and thank you, this one was warm enough to swim in and there was a pool near the bar that was seriously warm.  We picked up our gear and headed over to Nirvana, aptly named at this point.

Nirvana has a sandy beach on one side and the other side is your standard tile pool.  It is also surrounded by cabanas and there is a bar with some bar games and it looks like they do swim up gaming when they are busier.

It's unfortunate that the other pools are so freezing, but its nice to know that there was still a pool that is swimmable.  I just wish we'd discovered it earlier in the day!

I loved the layout and the landscaping of the Hard Rock pools.  The option for non-guests to visit for free during the week is AWESOME, but I think they make up for it with the outrageous drink prices, so we stuck to the free ice water they set out.  I just can't drop $20 on a 12oz drink.  YIKES!

I definitely recommend you check this out when you're pool hopping Vegas like we do in the summer and we will totally be back if they do this next summer!",0,0,0

I'm over 40, was in town for business, and I'm a woman who wears my skirts much, much longer than the Hard Rock's ever-present roving packs of high-heeled, glittery party girls. Also, the word ""woo!"" never occurs to me as something to scream out at random moments, but in this place I guess it's something of a mating call. If that scene appeals to you, you'll have a great stay at the Hard Rock. Me, I was definitely out of my element.

I love rock music, and there's not a clunker on the playlist. All the hits and classics. It streams constantly. At first it's awesome, but after a few days it can become a bit much. Don't they torture prisoners this way? Rock music in the chaotic lobby after a long day offsite at work events. Rock music in the elevator at 6am. Rock music in the ladies room. The parking garage. The pool. For a day or so, good, let's rock. I was there for fourteen days. Big mistake.

Another problem was that I happened to be there in April, when the Hard Rock throws a multi-day pool party -- Rehab. It's popular for the perky bikini crowd and the tanned young hardbodies that follow them around. It's essentially a wild rave, in the pool, thousands of beautiful young things crotch-deep in the water, saying a lot of loud ""woo"" and taking selfies. The Hard Rock is known for its pool. It's huge, it wraps around like a waterway and it's designed to mimic a sandy beach. And once a year they throw a party in it.

I saw a piece of promotional giveaway that read, and I kid you not, ""I rubbed one out at Rehab."" 

I, um, did not go into the water.

The rooms are nice. One stand-out is that there are big wide windows you can open for a gorgeous desert breeze any time of day or night. It's very unusual to find a Vegas hotel where the windows open.

You can pretty much get the full Hard Rock experience by walking around the casino, having a drink, maybe have dinner at the Pink Taco, a pretty good Mexican place inside the Hard Rock.",5,5,2

Not only is it off strip with two parking structures located on each end, it is one of the places I spot celebrities (in their natural habitat) hanging out with their friends. My last trip yielded the likes of Ron Jeremy, DJ Ashba (of Guns and Roses), and Courtney Love headed to Vinyl where she was performing (which was the whole reason for my visit).

Like all Hard Rock cafes, the place is littered with memorabilia and because there is so much more space than the traditional cafe set up there are proper displays. I've seen the iconic Britney Spears ""Baby One More Time"" outfit, Madonna's cone bra, so much Beatles merchandise my head will spin in a Exorcist fashion. 

The rooms in the place are nice and offer some great views of the strip (be sure to ask for a room that faces West (this will also make you hate the sun a whole lot less. If that isn't available ask for a room over looking the pool. The rooms are lush and have large bathrooms and beds that feel like you're sleeping on a cloud. All guest have access to the hotel gym which is HUGE. As a local, it rivals a lot of the nicer gyms in town.

The restaurants in this place are amazing. Mr. Lucky's is open 24\/7 and has a secret menu, Culinary Dropout, and Pink Taco also serve mighty awesome offerings and are not overly priced. There is also a really nice steak house, too. 

The Hard Rock is awesome with nightlife as well. Body English nightclub and afterhours is amazing! Plays a lot of house music, has a hip hop room. Vanity is well, vanity. I am not sure if it is actually open anymore or not. It is a nice, small, intimate venue. The pool on Sundays turns into Rehab, the party that single-handedly created Daylife in Vegas (daytime adult (21+) pool parties). The is a bar located in the middle of the main casino called Circle Bar. For Vegas, the drinks are reasonably prices and the ogling of celebrities can easily be done.

I didn't want a big wedding, I just wanted to marry my soulmate and father of my child. We decided that Vegas was gonna be our best solution. We made a reservation for a basic room, and when we arrived, we asked if there was any early check ins. Surely enough, they did. Unfortunately none of them were non smoking rooms. As my son and I sat in the car contemplating how we would keep cool (Middle of summer) my husband informed the person at the front desk that if we couldn't get a non smoking room we would just find a place to keep cool until our room was ready. Without hesitation, they upgraded us to a non smoking suite with no charge. It was an amazingly gorgeous suite! Along with the hotel staff, the valet was above and beyond (efficient and informative) as well as the bell staff. Despite having anything and EVERYTHING you need to care for an infant (I filled up his entire bell cart) and yet he was still offering any more assistance if needed for the duration of my stay. He gave me his name, but it was 4 years ago, so I am having a hard time remembering. I think this is one place in Vegas I will stay at any time I make a visit.

Within 5 minutes of entering the hardest rockin hotel in Vegas, I was mocked and called gay by a roving pack of meatheads.  Not sure if it was the pink shirt or my slim fit jeans that set them off, but I have to say it was a rough start to my stay here.  Other than that, things were awesome though!  I got checked into my room quickly, slammed a cold beer from the minifridge and ironed my shirt, eager for the night ahead.  My friends were playing a concert at the music venue inside the hotel, it's called the Joint.   The show went off without a hitch, everyone was in high spirits afterwards and we ended up taking a ton of shroom dust from some girls we met and hittin' the casino floor to try our chances with Lady Luck!  It was fun to see everyone's different gambling strategies.  Ryan fared the best with his ""max bet"" method, Psymun played slow and strategically, Jeremy had a a hunch about the Lil' Red Riding hood machine, while Justin donned his sunglasses and kept betting hard on his ""lucky number"" 22.   I think we all lost a ton of money except for Ryan that lucky bastard.  In any case, we eventually grew tired of losing, took some more shroom dust and went across the street to the stripclub Centerfolds , which at 5:30 am was blasting White Zombie and contained a sad and desperate lot of busted dancers. We didn't stay too long.   Sometimes you gotta know when to fold 'em lol.  As the sun came up and we shuffled back to our rooms at the Hard Rock I projectile vomited into the bushes in the front.

Culinary Dropout was 2 stars, plus another 1\/2 star for the pretzel bites. The ""free shuttle"" to the strip stops at 5, so if you want to spend the day at the pool and evening on the strip, your time is limited. The pool is divided into numerous parts, with the outside bathroom next to the stage. If you don't pay for the wristband to enter that area, then you have to take your wet, sandy self inside the hotel. They do bag checks on their guests like they're criminals. I bought a couple items at Fuel Coffee just inside the doors, but they made me throw it all away before going out to the pool. I could go on an on an on....

My friend and I had an early morning flight from Seattle and we arrived at the hotel around 8:30 am.

And the BEDS, OMG they are by far the best beds to sleep in after getting in at 4:00 in the morning! 

For a three night stay plus round trip, nonstop flights it came to about $380 per person, which IMO was a complete steal.... The location is a little inconvenient, but nothing that a $6.00 cab ride can't fix.

For me, the Hard Rock has lost its mojo. It used to have a sort of hip, independent feel to it but now it's just an average corporate Las Vegas hotel with a gimmick. It's not very rock n roll, it's pretty ordinary. Despite the event that was taking place, check in was a breeze although I was 2 hours early for check in they were going to charge me a $10 ""early check in"" fee. Really ?! This is the sort crap that gets on my nerves but I doubt this practice is unique to the Hard Rock.

The room was clean, the bed was nice and the bathroom was excellent. No complaints there, I'll give the room a 5. The check in clerk was really, really good 5 stars for him. When I made my booking I neglected to check what event was being hosted at the hotel. To my horror, I found out the Hard Rock Hotel was hosting the annual AVN Awards and Expo, basically a four day porn festival. I was with my wife, celebrating our wedding anniversary and we find ourselves in the middle of a porn fest. Ugh. But that's not the Hard Rock's fault and that did not count against them in my review.

I checked in Sunday afternoon. And even though I missed the Avn awards, the scenery this casino offered was still very delightful. 
Check in process was nice and easy, with a full cast of employees covering all stations to speed the process. The Rock memorabilia displayed isn't my thing but for those into Music and History of, I would imagine this to be a nice bonus for your stay. I didn't eat at the casino this time but I have been to their NOBU restaurant on multiple occasions and each time left satisfied. I am a particular fan of the Omakase, the chefs choice. It's a nice way to learn a new cultures food. 
The center bar and sports book were both easily accessible and hot beds of activity for any gamers or drinkers. 
My first and only real complaint was the cleanliness of the hallways and poorly lit, under manicured bathroom. 
The room though average size felt very open and the ability to open a door to the outside air was a particular treat. 
Although now that I think about it, the wifi was something I didn't care for. They do offer connection but for high speed you have to pay a premium and go through a whole process. Why not just 'point and click add to the bill'? 
Mini bar was stocked well, however getting into the refrigerator required magic, so...
I didn't attend but I know they still do The Sunday Pool party which last I checked was still one of the best parties in town. 
But the highlight of the stay was the Bed. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever laid in and outfitted with some of the softest and most inviting sheets and pillows on the planet. In retrospect, I would have spent more time in bed that working out or walking around. 

My recommendation, if you want to have a good time and a reasonable price stay that offers accessible location to all things on the strip (ps-strip club across the street and the fruit loop just south for all you gay party goers)

My friends and I would head here every spring break and we always seemed to win money, have a great facial at the spa, and have some adventures at the pool.

Nowadays I find the Hard Rock a little depressing.  The gambling is not as good and neither are the restaurants.  The rooms could use a face lift.  And while the scene is not quite yet starting to resemble Circus Circus, despite some noble efforts at the club and pool, the hot fun crowd has definitely moved elsewhere.  However, I still give it props for the pool and the concert Joint.  The pool has sand that feels almost like a real beach and the swim up blackjack tables are awesome.  The Joint is a fun venue for shows.

ll in all, the Hard Rock needs to either remodel or lower its price point.  I'd stay here just for the pool and the clubs if the prices were more on par with what they should be in Vegas hotels showing this kind of age.  But at these prices (hard to get for less than $99) I'd much rather stay at the Wynn or Palms Place for just a few bucks more.  At these prices, the HRH needs to step up its game, especially since its off the strip.",0,0,0

Location: you will need a car or an uber to go anywhere. this place is about a 10 min drive from anywhere on the strip, and a 25 min walk during the day (do not recommend it at night bc sketchy). My friends and I uber'ed everywhere, which gets annoying after a while due to Strip traffic and cost (we sat in traffic for 50 minutes once to go two blocks). There's a shuttle, but it runs infrequently from 10-5 and drops you off near the Wynn, which is still a good walk from everywhere else. At least it's close to the airport, about a 10-15 min drive. 

Room: I came with two female friends and we shared a queen room in the casino tower. It was clean, spacious and pretty nice, but our view on the second floor was of a bare rooftop. Beds and pillows were a little on the softer side, and I woke up with dry eyes every morning since the room didn't have a humidifier of any sort. Great water pressure in the shower, but the house shampoo and conditioner is watery - bring your own. 

Hotel: you have to walk through the casino to get to any of the rooms and the hotel is a mess of hallways and different corridors. Confusing layout. When we were there, the gym had also been relocated to a tiny room next to the Reliquary spa, and every cardio machine (all ten of them, anyway) was being used at 10AM on a Thursday morning. The center is stuffy and has terrible ventilation. There's a minuscule open floor area for mat workouts for maybe 3 people to workout and about 5 weight machines. I guess they don't expect visitors to Vegas to be anything but hungover during the daytime.

Food: I strongly suggest going down the street for dinner, since there are plenty of good restaurant options nearby and the ones in house are not spectacular. My friends thought Pink Taco was terrible and Fu was similar to cheap takeout at a 300% markup.",3,1,0

If you have watched Girls Gone Wild and thought to yourself, ""I want to go to there"" then, this is your jam. If you're an older dude that is looking to get the band back together, hey, party on. 

We came here because someone else was paying\/picking. Had we been paying, I would have been super cranky. Everything here is somewhat over-priced but the real kicker is the fine print add-ons with everything. We weren't planning on buying anything and we certainly didn't once we got there but we couldn't help but notice that there were added fees on almost everything this place offered. If bottle service to your room is something you think is great enough to pay $80 for, just know that it's another $3 delivery fee, a 21% gratuity and an additional 8.1% sales tax. I mean, they could just say, Jack Daniels, $105 but you know, they want you to think it's more reasonable? Also, when we tried to ask for a late check out the night before we were told that we would have to call back in the morning to see what availability was like and we might be able to extend checkout until noon for free. When we asked what the charge to stay a little later might be we were told that too must wait until tomorrow. Now, the hotel seemed less than half full to us so maybe they thought 400 people were going to magically show up demanding rooms. I don't know, I do not work in the middle aged rock n roll vampire hotel bikini business, so I won't speak out of place. 

The bed was incredibly comfortable, but seeing as how it looks like something out an episode of True Blood, be aware that the lights are super dim. Our room was a little dimmer than most on account a few of the bulbs being burnt out. The shower looks cool but isn't the most functional thing I've ever seen, I mean, in the way that the water should stay in the shower? Also, while the hallway didn't seem noisy, there was an adjoining room door that was pretty thin. I think the people next to us were having some sort of domestic issue that might have involved some sort of infidelity between friends. We're not sure because we couldn't completely make out what was being said because the door wasn't that thin. 

The waitstaff in the restaurant was super great, no complaints about house keeping but staff walking around seemed kind of, I dunno, cranky?

Hard Rock combines retro style with a modern playfulness that really embodies the Vegas spirit. Hard Rock is home to two concert facilities, where more than a few music legends have graced the stage, and Vegas' premier pool complex, complete with a floating bar, private cabanas and plush daybeds. 

The rooms are pretty spacious with the standard rooms clocking in at over 460 square feet. The amenities include comfortable down bedding, granite counters, sunken tubs, Bose stereos, tufted headboards and a large flat screen. The pools are beautiful. Since it was off-season, we only got to use the upper deck pool in the HRH Tower. We had the pool all to ourselves. 

There's a nice selection of restaurants, clubs and lounges on the casino level, including Pink Taco, a nice upscale sports bar (The Ainsworth), a 24-hour cafe (Mr. Lucky's) and a contemporary steakhouse (35 Steaks + Martinis). Enjoy tasty gastropub favorites and drinks at the hip Culinary Dropout. Try the pretzel bites and provolone fondue! 

There are a few downsides that I experienced while at the Hard Rock. Chief among them is the distance from the Strip. The Hard Rock is about a 15 minute walk or a short cab ride to and from the Strip ($10-12 each way). The complimentary shuttle they offer from 10am - 5pm wasn't available the 2 times we tried to use it...shuttle was full both times. We were also charged for several items from the minibar that were not used or even touched...overcharges to the tune of $65.

I live in Miami & the Ft Lauderdale charges nearly the same year round. but It was a decent decorated room. the bathroom is beautiful. the view outside the room was over looking the pool area which was also very beautiful. especially in the morning. they did a very good job cleaning extremely messy rooms. we were in Vegas & throwing our clothes almost everywhere but would return and they would be organized in one area for us which I highly admired the cleaners for. it came with a coupon book I highly suggest you read as soon as you get to your room. I didn't read that book until I got back to Miami and was pissed because it was some nice free offers inside especially paying what I paid for the stay there. they have a van that drive you to the Vegas strip. we rented a car which I would recommend unless your just in Vegas for shopping & partying and even still it's much more useful to just have a rental car and leave and go where ever you feel like. I was able to check my bill & checked out the HRH via TV which was awesome because we were late waking up. I would give it 5 stars but I'm bitter. it wasn't a wonderful experience for the wonderful money they were paid. it was October and getting cold & Vegas tourism was slowing down. no need to pay summer prices for fall. overall I don't think you'll have a bad stay here you just might not feel like the prices add up to the quality of hotel the HRH is,0,0,0

He gave us a friendly nod and seemed to be having fun playing roulette (though he was no high roller, let me tell you).  And he was totally nice about taking a picture with us (check it out).

1) Room was very spacious and clean
2) Bed was comfortable
3) Center bar was never too crowded, and it was very easy to get a bartender
4) Taxi line was very efficient

Now the bad:
1) $13.99 per day for Internet
2) Hotel constantly reeked of smoke and whatever air spritzer they put in to try to cover up the smoke.  Even my non-smoking room smelled of smoke
3) Restaurants were awful
4) If there was a ""younger crowd,"" I didn't see it, unless that's what they call the ""trashy 40-50-year-old set.""  Although I was entertained for a good two hours watching some guys with mullets hit on some 55-year-old blondes in miniskirts.

One thing about this hotel\/casino establishment is that it's geared a lot more so towards partying than gambling.   The casino floor is actually not all that big, and you can probably walk the entire slot area in about five minutes along the main thoroughfares.

I had heard good things, but unfortunately our experience was very different. We booked our room at the end of August. I called the Hard Rock the week that I had booked the room just to make sure they had reserved the correct room and everything was in order. I also called the week before we left for our weekend in Vegas. They confirmed my single non-smoking king room. I also told them that we would be arriving later than check-in (but well before midnight). The woman on the phone assured me that was totally fine and that she would make a note. When we arrived Friday night around 9:30pm, they were having trouble with our reservation. They had NO non-smoking rooms for us. The girl at the front desk told us they had a smoking room, but reassured me it had been newly renovated so it wouldn't smell like smoke. (unfortunate, but we went with it). Upon entering our room they had given us a room with 2 queens. I called down to the front desk to explain the mistake. The girl at the front desk was not understanding or apologetic at all. I asked to speak to her manager. The manager (David Gallego) then got on the phone. He immediately had an attitude and was very very rude and sarcastic about the situation saying ""Well what do you expect? It's a Friday night in Vegas?!?"" Well...I expect to have the room I reserved and paid for 3 months ago....VERY very poor customer service.We were very disappointed. On top of this, we got back to our room Saturday around 6:00pm to get ready for dinner reservations we had and no maid had come to clean our room or give us new sheets\/towels the entire day we were gone!! Overall, I would not say our experience at the Hard Rock Las Vegas is one that I would like to repeat.

Inconveniently located a mile OFF The Strip, I grabbed a room at the HRH&C merely because it was offered for $45.  I had gambled and been to shows at The Joint before but never stayed there so . . . what the hell.  Why not?

I thought the rooms were fairly decent despite the fact I paid an additional $35 to 'upgrade' to a corner room in the Paradise Tower which gave me a gorgeous view of a dirt lot.  The beds were over-the-top soft (which I viewed as a negative -- but, to each their own when it comes to mattresses).  I did love the enormous shower so . . . there's that.

I stayed here last weekend for 2 nights w\/ a bunch of girlfriends for a bachelorette party and our experience @ the Hard Rock kept getting worse and worse from beginning to end of our stay. I swear whenever we said ""It can't get any worse than this""... we were wrong! 

So here are all the things that went wrong last weekend: 

1. We booked 2 adjacent rooms w\/ 2 double beds each, BUT Hard Rock accidentally booked us 2 adjacent rooms w\/ 1 king bed each. In result...no adjacent rooms, but we were able to get 2 rooms w\/ 2 double beds. 

2. Hard Rock changed their policy on comp'd wristbands for rehab, & did not bother to inform their guests. Apparently they only give 1 wristband per room (used to be based on how many people per room... 4 max) & everyone else to pay $100 a pop regardless if you are a guest. We were really upset about this because rehab was the main reason why we chose to stay @ the Hard Rock to get 4 comp'd wristbands. My friends spoke with the manager via phone & the manager was rude & even hung up on my friend then blamed my friend for hanging up. In the end, they wouldn't budge & stuck with their so called ""policy"" w\/ 1 wristband per room & $100 a pop per additional person. 

3. We found nails\/screws on the floor in one of the rooms... since this was a HUGE no no on their end Hard Rock FINALLY agreed on giving 2 wristbands for rehab per room instead of 1 per room (AND P.S. the 7 additional people got hooked up & only paid $20 each to get into Rehab instead of $100 & we didn't have to wait in line!! SO IN YOUR FACE MF-in HARD ROCK HOTEL YOU LOST $560 HAHAHA!!!) 

4. One of the rooms did not have a remote control for the TV, so one of the employees came by and brought a remote that didn't work.. then she came back again with another one that STILL didn't work & she said she would have an engineer come by, but he never did... Therefore, we didn't have a TV all freakin weekend!!! 

5. We were being harassed by our next door neighbors (a bunch of loud obnoxious douche bags). So we get to our hotel room (3 of us girls) and one of the guys is standing outside his room asking us where we were partying @ that night. We were polite and whatever then his Sasquatch friend came out (not even kidding this guy is like 6'5, while all us girls are like 5'4 & under)... THEN once we opened our door to go in Sasquatch pried himself into our room & refused to get out, so 3 of my tiny friends had to push that fool out of our room. Mind you, these boys were super wasted\/scary looking. We ended up calling security because we were so freaked out. Derrick from Security came up and spoke with us. He was very professional\/accommodating & understood where we were coming from & he went over to talk to the guys to warn them that they are not to enter another guest's hotel room uninvited & if they cause trouble again then they will be removed from the hotel. Anyway, after doing this we were still scared to see these boys in the hallway. They ended up playing a practical joke and running down the hallway with a mask on screaming and scaring us. One of the guys also said ""If you call security again, you're really gonna get it"" .... I mean talk about feeling unsafe! I swear this hotel was filled with annoying douche bag guys! 

6. We got charged $300+ for items from the mini bar which we never opened!! so we had to sort it out & the charges eventually got removed. 

7. The icing to the cake: as we were all ready to check out of our room I opened the door and what did I see? A freakin thick vacum cord across the doorway as high as where my knee hits! I was like WTF?! Someone could really trip on this! So I unplugged it... The maid was across the hall and too lazy to plug it in in a closer outlet! and after I unplugged it dude gave me attitude! 

So there it is! I am never going to stay here again and I really dont recommend it to anyone else! If you wanna go to rehab, just stay somewhere else and then go to rehab separately. It's not worth the wristbands cuz you gotta wait in line anyway.",8,3,2

I lived in vegas for 6 months and have never been to Hard Rock till this past weekend... crazy right? this hotel is made for young party people... for real. there are beautiful girls everywhere (patrons) cool rock memorabilia all over the place and girls dancing on poles right above the slot machines. what else could you want? our room was sweet. flat screen tv comfy bed, good view, condoms and lube in the drawer, and the shower head was at least 6'9 (im 6'4 and i didnt have to slouch down to get under the shower head which was a relief) i saw tony gonzalez from the KC Chiefs at the Pink Taco restaurant inside Hard Rock with like 10 girls all over 9's.... life aint fair i tell ya!! lol but i'll definitely be back here. hopefully next time for longer. only reason why i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because its a little small, it's not on the strip, and you can hear planes flying over the hotel all day... but other than that, is A ok


p.s. i STRONGLY advise NOT touching anything inside the fridge when your in your room... all the items inside there is are placed on top of an electronic sensor so once you pick it up (you dont even have to consume it) you automatically get charged... and it aint cheap... so be careful!",3,1,1

The first thing I'd like to express my displeasure over, is the fact that Thursday night hotel guests were allowed early VIP admittance into the concert, before Friday (the night of) guests. Where is the logic in that? Had I known it even existed, I would have booked for the previous evening! Not fair at all. 
Other things I disliked about the hotel and\/or areas relative to it, were the elevator situation, our broken, bathroom door handle, the poor toilet flushing feature, the terrible wifi, no in-room coffee maker, 2 towels for an occupancy\/booking of 3-4 people, and the disorganization surrounding the security and people responsible for The Joint\/concert crowd. 
As far as my bathroom door handle falling off, it's not a complaint, in that I didn't call down, but will rather mention it at check out. The toilets always needed to be flushed 2 or 3 times, to get ""back to normal"". Annoying. The elevator situation sucks! This was discussed often, by other guests as well!!! You enter the elevator and insert your room key card, before selecting your floor. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. If I enter by myself, no problem. However, usually several people get on and need to go to their rooms. When I'd enter and slip my key in for the 10th floor, the other guests had to scramble and also insert their keys for let's say floors 4 and 7. Once the elevator passed floor 4, from my initial entry, that guest had to then stop at 7 (if that guest made it on time), stop at 10 for me, and any other floor where a guest was going down. Soooo, that guest that missed their floor 4, had to start back at the lobby again, to now become the first to input their card! INSANITY. I get the ""security and safety"" behind all that, but it's much easier and mentally sane, to have a guard at the elevators, checking room keys. Grrrr. 
Wifi included in your stay is nice, when it works. It would work on our beds, but not near the vanity area, or bathroom. It worked in the main hotel areas, but not the meeting room near the Music\/Artist Hall, so we wasted lots of data. I can't stand when a hotel room doesn't include a coffee maker. It's so inexpensive, super convenient for guests, and FREE. The hotel greed of making me stumble down to the casino floor, half presentable, and to pay $3 for a drip coffee, is just absurd. Thanks Super 8, at $53\/night, for letting me wake up and caffeinate my way! 
I won't end on the bad, so here's what I liked. The rooms are gorgeous. The beds were soft, decor upscale, and it felt large and roomy. Many storage areas and outlets, plus extra options. 
The pool area looked INCREDIBLE!! I didn't get to utilize it, but I will on a return visit, no doubt! 
Karen, who works for Room Service, was a doll! I came back to the room late (post concert) with 2 hungry teens. We had a lengthy hold time, but Karen answered and was soooo polite and friendly! We ordered 3 chicken tender\/fries plates and she stated it could take up to an hour. She explained they'd try and hurry and asked about our concert and made me feel special. The food came in half the time, it was delicious, and I went to bed thinking how her customer service alone, made my night. 
I'll be back to stay, for sure. I love the music piping throughout the hotel, the shops\/restaurants, music memorabilia, and more.",5,3,3

Security seemed like they would help me recover by reviewing video footage. However, I had to keep calling them, and after a day, they told me I found the one place in their casino where the camera didn't work. Yea, ok. So, I'm guessing an employee stole it. I tried to lodge a complaint with the hotel  manager. She promised to have the manager of security (they contract out, so not their problem) call me. That never happened. Overall, that was our general experience with HRH staff. They were unhelpful and rude: the dealers, the employees helping you get cabs, the employee check before you got into rehab. We have stayed here many times so we were surprised to be treated this way. Somewhat embarrassing too, as we brought 10 of our friends with us. We won't be staying here again.",1,0,0

I've stayed here at least 4 times and I return for it's many positives: Stylish rooms, enjoyable restaurants, festive environment, killer pools and lastly, a fantastic gym. 

I became a ""backstage pass"" member at the outset of this last visit. My concierge at check-in was exceptional. I imagine I'll be back but..some things...starting with...the gym now sucks. I don't understand why. I get they moved the spa. I swear they have changed their spa at least three times in 8 years. Why? No idea. Still overpriced. 

But the gym feels like a 1\/4 the size of the last one and one in which you'd find at a run of the mill Sheraton. 

That said, it has a Pink Taco which is a great destination after you've first arrived from check-in or after day drinking.

Which leads me to Rehab, the grand mommy of day clubs. This used to be included with your room. Now no more and if I'm going to have to listen to Keisha blare her soundcheck through my room when I am in hour 2 of my sleep, the least Hard Rock can offer me is the opportunity to lay at the pool while heterosexual hedonists revel about. 

If you are going to keep me up, at least provide me with Starbucks! I swear every major city in the world has a Starbucks at every three paces. Not Vegas! 

Hard Rock has Fuel....and their coffee is gross! Their yogurt parfaits are yummy to be fair. 

And lastly, Terrible room cleaning! It's been more than one visit where I've gotten a discount because of returning multiple times in a weekend to an untouched room.

Parking was full already- both garages. At least they were sincere enough to stick a security guard in front of one garage telling guests the lot was full; we spent an hour and a half in the other garage (HRH) trying to find parking in a sea of traffic going up and coming down the ramps.

While we were looking for parking, we decided to try to get in touch with a manager to possibly get a refund for the tickets we purchased should we miss the concert. After being transferred several times (reservations, ticketing, security, security manager, front desk, front desk manager) we finally spoke to Sarah, front desk manager- who told us that if we gave the valet attendant her name and presented our concert tickets, that we could valet the car. The valet manager refused and was very snippy and rude when given Sarah's name; even though there were 3 floors dedicated to valet parking in that garage alone, he wouldn't help. When we called Sarah back, she told us that if we weren't so rude to the employees they would have taken care of us but she would insure we were taken care of anyway. When the valet manager once again refused to accept the vehicle, we called Sarah a third time and were told that the valet manager had the final say and she could no longer resolve the situation.

I felt as though were were just brushed off at every avenue. I understand the situation with concert guests trying to valet their cars; there is no way they could park every car. At the same time, the guest service was the worst I've ever experienced- especially in Vegas. I'd never been called rude by an employee, ever.

I don't feel like I have unreasonable expectations; had we been informed when we were purchasing tickets to expect HEAVY delays we would have better prepared for the parking nightmare and parked somewhere else and taken a cab, had there been security in front of the HRH garage telling guests the lot was full we could have still made the concert had we parked somewhere else and taken a cab, had Sarah stood by her assurance that she would have us taken care of, had Hard Rock prepared overflow parking or not scheduled 3 events an hour apart on one night the situation could have been resolved or never arisen in the first place. 

I'll be sure to update with the amount of effort it takes to get a refund for the purchase price of the tickets for the event, and the result of my endeavor.

EDIT: We were refunded the purchase price of the tickets with the help of LeAnne, but she mentioned that she was only helping us because of how her staff treated us. I definitely won't be patronizing the LV Hard Rock, and doubt we'll be going to others or collecting the HR shot glasses anymore.

The hotel is located off the strip but it's a quick and easy $8 cab ride to the strip. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle, but during non-peak times of course, so we never took it. I'd love if they extended their shuttle times to at least 8 or 9pm so we could take it to dinner! It would also be great if the shuttle had multiple drop-off, pick-up locations rather than just Fashion Show.

Our room was very nice - large, clean, and comfortable! If the windows opened though, we could touch the parking garage. So, while the view was non-existent, self-parking was a breeze!

At the hotel, Pink Taco has great happy hour specials and Mr. Lucky's is a pretty decent go-to spot for late night dining and breakfasts. We didn't eat at Culinary Dropout, but I was excited to see them located here because I love their Scottsdale location.

I was super excited to come in here and have fun. The Hard Rock is one of those iconic Vegas places, and I wanted to see it. 

It's definitely not the Venetian or anything, but it's more modern and clean than Binion's or the Rio. The decorations are nice. I loved the collection of guitars they had on the walls and the history of musicians that used them, and other music memorabilia. I had a ton of fun just walking through and looking at everything on the walls and taking pictures. 

We went to the casino while we were there, and I really enjoyed that. My brother and I sat and played the Brittney Spears game together. That makes me sound like such a nerd. Lol. But we found many games, and they were quite entertaining. I have to appreciate the selection of games they had. There were a couple casinos I walked through, played ten minutes and was bored. That wasn't the case here. 

My only big complaint was the fact people have to walk through from the hotel through the casino to get to other areas of the building. There was some sort of pool party going on that evening when we were there. So as I'm walking through, I'm having to dodge and make my way through a thousand pretty much naked people, who aren't even there for the casino. I found that annoying. Which was honestly my only complaint. 

Would I return? Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this casino and would love to come back the next time I visit Las Vegas.

Located about 1.5 miles off the strip, it is a bit inconvenient - proximity is key in Vegas.

The hallway leading in from self-park is lined with original rock memorabilia, including all the rock greats; Elvis, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and really almost covers the progression of the rock movement. There are numerous signed paintings and it is just a sight to behold. As you enter the casino floor and registration, there is a great John Varvatos boutique and exotic watch boutique. At the elevators is a full drum set used during a world-famous rock tour.

The crowd is usually hip and trendy, and there is a new phenomenon of sick rock bands like Guns N' Roses setting shop for weeks at a time. Too bad I missed that:(

The pool is the ultimate pool experience in Vegas. During the summer months, it's Rehab Sundays, where all hell is unleashed. With an expansive pool area, there is gaming and a bar in the water, and cabanas equipped with fridges and TVs for those wanting to catch their breath. Rehab is really indescribable and really must be experienced. No holes are barred and complete partying ensues. All other pool parties are playgrounds in comparison.

The Hotel staff is super accommodating; we just requested a room change and were given a larger room with a great view of the pool and the strip.

My husband and I booked a room for a stay-cation almost two months ago, after a whirlwind of travel and work (another reason why this rating is so extremely low) we ended up staying that same weekend. Upon arrival in the valets we asked for a bell man for all of our luggage, due to my be a extreme over packer. The bell man wouldn't get the bags out of the back seat, because he seemed in to big of hurry so I had to do it while my husband was trying to get him to stop long enough for him to take the other items. 
We then proceed to check in, which seemed to go very well. The front desk lady was helpful and nice and informed us that she would notify the bell desk and send up the luggage cart. Great, a much better feeling then we just had, right?....

So off we go to our room and everything changes! We enter and right away I noticed the dust hanging from the fire sprinkler. Sign number one this wasn't going to be good. We walk in further and there are footprints still on the tile in the bathroom floor, mold in the shower, the sink is dirty, the room is so filthy the maids bosses should be fired for not holding their staff accountable and allowing this to be acceptable. We had traveled all day and were starving so we went eat before the restaurant closed and I debated what to do about our room. The following day, I called and was told nobody was available at this time so I could leave a message, which I did not, my mistake, maybe. I decided to email instead thing it would be more effective and even had pictures of all the defects of the room, that's how bad it was, something I have never had to do to an establishment. I waited until now when I just cleaned out those pictures from my phone after waiting two months for a response and nothing to post this scathing review. 
I also want to note they had my room number, contact numbers, husbands number, address, not to mention my email and I did receive the automatic response that said someone will be contacting you in in a couple of days or something to that effect, then nothing!! It shows to me as a consumer a few things; that they don't care about the issues going on within their establishment; there is no one overseeing what is going on within each department. Example: Housekeeping-Manager should be following up to check the rooms to make sure each floor meets all standards. It's a checks and balances system. In order to maintain high standards in a hotel as large as this you have to have to have these systems in place. This hotel doesn't seem to care nor have this in any area and it shows in each department.",2,2,1

The only things that are an area of concern are how loud it is. The rehab pool has a bass that makes the furniture in the rooms shake, and it's non stop all day until about 7pm. The WORST part is the pools have ""sand"" aka small rocks and they become so hot in the heat you will absolutely get a burn on the bottom of your feet.

I booked a room in the Casino Tower for $69 for a Saturday night with a rate that was supposed to get me a drink credit, but when checking in, the front desk clerk just played dumb and basically told me that if I didn't see a voucher on my reservation I wasn't going to get it.  Okay, that's fine that they're not honoring their special but dial down the attitude----with Vegas in a nosedive, maybe you should be a bit more customer-focused or you might not have a job in a few months.

Okay, enough with the snarkiness.  My basic reason for downgrading the hotel is 2 fold:  the Casino Tower rooms are in DESPERATE need of a renovation and there's always crazy noisiness in the hotel hallways at all hours of the night.  I understand that this is a party hotel and I'm no longer in my 20's, but please all you drunken idiots that like to bang on the light fixtures in the hallways at 4am, give it a break!  Some of us do like to get some sleep while it's still dark outside.  As for the rooms, while big they are pretty much a dump with broken door handles, holes in the wall and mold in the shower.  Thankfully the beds are the only saving grace still being quite comfy despite the fact that they haven't been replaced in a decade.  I realize that the 2 new towers are the place to be but it's still no excuse for renting out ratty rooms for the prices they're charging.  Based on what others have said here, I should have used Priceline to get one of the newer rooms for about the same price.

One other thing----the new Casino addition seems to lack any soul to it.  We went in there and it was virtually empty with none of the hipness of the original Casino area (with it's circular bar in the center).  Only good thing was that we won $400 from the machines there which more than offset the ""lost"" drink credit!

My stay at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino was definitely a mixed bag... On one hand, the room we stayed in was beautiful; we shelled out a few extra dollars to stay in the HRH King Suite, and the physical room was amazingly designed which was worth it on one hand. However the smell in the room was pungent, quite stale, and unsettling. Little common things were missing from the room, shampoo, conditioner, soap, cups,... etc... This was actually a big deal as I was in Vegas for a one day conference, and wanted to travel as light as possible so I did not pack any liquids, and certainly did not pack any cups... Also, Wi-Fi was supposed to be included for free, except the signal was so low, none of our devices could actually connect to it... Major let down.  
Second, I did park my car at the hotel, which is complimentary for hotel guests (fantastic policy!). I also decided to Valet and assumed my car would be better taken care of as the hotel is quite far away from anything else in Vegas. When I reached my room I realized I had left a bag in my car and needed to retrieve it. I asked the HRH desk staff the best way to attain my belongings, and was told to ""go ask the front desk on the other side of the casino""... Not so polite, but whatever. After speaking to a few more people and being sent back to where I started my questioning in the HRH tower, I find myself at a different valet station, I inform the gentleman of my problem, and tell him if someone can either grab my car or my bag, I'm happy to tip whomever, I just need my belongings. He responds by giving me my keys, and telling me ""Go back across the casino, outside to the left, and then down the ramp under the hotel, and to the right. Your car is somewhere to the right."" Why did I bother to valet if Im forced on a 15 minute journey under the hotel to a desolate parking lot at midnight? If I self parked, sure, but unfortunately that is not the case. 
Third, I understand it's Vegas but you get nickel and dimed for everything, I purchased a yogurt and coffee in the hotel coffee shop, however I did not  get a spoon, normally this is not a big deal... However, when I called downstairs and asked for one, they informed me I would ""be charged me for the spoon..."" Seriously, I bought the food from the hotel, and then get charged to eat it?These things add up. 
Lastly, upon check in I confirmed check out time of 11am, the desk clerk even offered to extend it an hour for me as I was attending a tech conference at another hotel for the morning. I thought that was insightful, great service, until the morning. When I ventured out the following for morning on coffee and the above mentioned yogurt debacle, I was locked out of the elevator, both my room keys had been disabled at 7:30am. I went to the desk where they reactivated my room keys, went back to the room and my meeting. I returned at 1030am to find my room keys had been deactivated again for early check out. 
All in all, I was let down a bit. The room was beautiful, I need to state that again. However the staff at best was rude, and didn't seem to really care about the customer. I get that this was the off season in Vegas, I was there for business and I was nearly late for my meetings because of all this nonsense.  I expect more from a brand like the Hard Rock.",2,0,0

Horrible experience and will never stay here again. Definitely avoid on holidays. You might end up with a room nothing like you booked and they will just say sorry, nothing we can do.

Annoying at times, but not unexpected. However, the jagged broken glass aftermath in the hallway that remained for a FULL day and night was completely unacceptable. They charge a resort fee, presumably for amenities, yet any and all amenities are banned to anyone below 21.

We refused because we figured we wouldn't be spending much time in the room. They upgraded us for free.. Nice but if your going to upgrade just do it... We wanted to check out the pool but the club was going on so we waited. Took a $10 taxi to the strip, hung out there all night it was great. 
The room is dark and only half of the lights worked. There was no coffee maker... What????!!! Found a hairdryer hanging in the closet.. Whew. 
There was construction going on but that didn't bother us much. The biggest complaint and the reason I wouldn't go back is the security. It was RIDICULOUS. I was with my husband, we just wanted to relax, have some drinks and gamble. Our room was in paradise tower so we would look at the windows to the pool when we walked by and EVERY time a security guy would run over and ask us what we were doing. It seemed everywhere we went they wanted to know what we were doing. If we walked one way they would tell us to go another. The pool was the same way. Half of it was closed, and we couldn't even walk around and look. The worst part was they have tons of daybeds instead of lounge chairs that you have to pay for. We thought about a cabana but only wanted to chill for a little bit so decided not to. The cabanas and daybeds were empty. Everyone had to put there stuff on the edge of the pool. One guy told me they had lounge chairs at the family pool so we walked over there. I'm not sure what kind of sand it was but I burnt my feet on it and then fell. You absolutely could not walk on it. We finally got in the pool and relaxed, but even ordering a drink was a hassle. The first guy let my husband charge it to the room no questions, the second time he went they needed me there with my ID. They also do not let you bring water in.. Whaaaaat????!  So we left and went back to the room but not with one more time of a security guard yelling ""HEY YOU NEED TO LEAVE THAT TOWEL HERE!"" Kind of embarrassing... 
Besides that the casino sucked we played roulette and the dealer and pit guy were having a personal conversation the whole time. When we sat down at the bar one bartender said you can't drink here unless you put $20 in the machine... Like before we even sat down!!  Another bartender told me a muscow mule couldn't be comped after I had been drinking them all night... 
All in all it seems like they must deal with young drunk people and that is how they have learned to treat people. I will definitely stay in a nicer hotel next time that treats the guests respectfully. It was irritating that every time someone came to talk to us we were like, ""what did we do now?",1,0,0

Yet the room I received couldn't be called a suite by any stretch of the imagination.  It was an average hotel room, and no, having a sofa in a the room does not make it even a Jr. Suite. Plenty of hotel rooms have those.  So I have to say their advertising is pretty misleading.  But with that said, I paid about $40 for the room (during a huge convention none the less) so I cant complain too much.  It was a nice room -- very clean, all white and grey modern decor which I liked a lot.  Except I didnt enjoy the photo of Pete Wentz urinating on the wall next to the bed. Im pretty sure no one wants to look at that.

The hotel itself is pretty cool -- much smaller than most but I enjoyed the decor. It definitely screamed rock but not in a pretentious way.  The bar drinks were good but they need a drink menu with good, sweet drinks, and a bartender who is a bit more friendly.  The dining choices at the hotel are just okay -- I ended up walking across the street to get food most of the time.  And thats what I liked the most about staying there.  There's a strip mall across the street with Korean BBQ, Sushi, Indian Food, a Mexican Cantina, all of my favorites, not to mention a convenient CVS.

I didnt have any problems with the staff. I did have issues with some of the douchebag, bro types who stay at places like this and think it's okay to harass women for just walking into the hotel. Of course the hotel cant control their actions, but this type of place tends to attract a certain clientele.

Overall, the value was good for what I paid for it.",1,0,0

Since this wasn't a planned Vegas trip, we decided to stray from the strip and got an awesome deal on a room at the Hard Rock. Such a great deal that we decided to extend this unplanned Vegas stop 2 days.

The first night we were in a corner room in the Paradise Tower. We were assured this was one of the best rooms, since it has windows on two walls and is extra spacious. The windows were awesome. They even had black out curtains that were controlled by a device on the wall, so that was fun. On a first look, the room looked really awesome, chic, and stylish.

Upon further inspection, however, the room appeared to be old and decrepit, just hiding all that ugliness under a splash of paint and some new furniture. But seriously, the room was falling apart. The awesome iPod player? Didn't work. The sweet, electronic black out curtains? Falling off their hooks. The furniture? Showing signs of age, wear, and tear.

My biggest peeve about the room was the poor design of the bathroom. I understand that the corner rooms are wheelchair accessible. Great. But if you are going to have a shower that makes space for a wheelchair, please have a door that shuts, or something, because otherwise the shower floods the whole bathroom. 

The second night, due to consistent problems with our room, a very gracious person at the front desk upgraded us to the HRH Tower. I was expecting more of the same. WOW. Totally wrong.

Every room in the HRH Tower is a suite! And the epitome of chic! Wet bar area, gorgeous couch and flat screen, a touch screen panel that controls music for the whole suite, lush California king with another flat screen, and a HUGE bathroom with jacuzzi tub, OH MY! Seriously. I was in love.

I would DEFINITELY stay in the HRH Tower again. It was so awesome I didn't mind being off the strip and it is actually reasonable as far as suites in Vegas go. So if you feel like being spoiled on a budget, it's definitely an option. If you aren't springing for the suite, however, look elsewhere, because there really is no other good reason to stay here.",1,0,1

My wife and I don't get a lot of opportunity to vacation.  So we decided to make it a bit more special by upgrading to a jr suite.  I booked and paid for the room in advance.  When we showed up to check in there was an added $20 a day hidden resort fee.  I wasn't too thrilled about paying it but I was tired and just wanted to head up to our room.  After getting to our room I wasn't really impressed.  The lights in the room are overly complicated to use.  Very poor design in my oppinion.  After figuring out how to shut down all of the lights I realized I couldn't shut off the light directly over my bed.  So I called the front desk and they sent a person up to repair the light.  Then I woke up early in the morning and realized the toilet doesn't flush.  So I called the front desk again.  They said an engineer would be up to fix it soon.  I left to go check out the strip and returned several hours later to find the toilet still did not work.  So I called the front desk again.  They sent somone up to bring us a key for another room.  After my 2 night stay at the Hardrock I was now ready to check out.  The front desk asked me how my stay was?  I told them it wasn't that great and explained my frustrations.  He apalogized and waived one night of the hidden $20 added resort charges.  I can understand rooms are not always perfect but they really didn't live up to my expectations.  The biggest bummer is seeing how little they care when there is a problem.  Hardrock will not have another opportunity for my business.,1,0,0

I'm getting a little long in the tooth (well into my late 20s...call me grandma), but I still prefer Hard Rock and it's cool guys and hoochies to the retirement homes I find elsewhere in Vegas. 

Pool? Best pool in Vegas. Intimidated by all of the hard bodies at the pool? Get over yourself. Everyone is too worried about themselves to worry about you and your muffin top. Just have a drink and enjoy yourself. 

Gambling? Great. Even when I lose I have a good time. I've had more fun and interesting dealers at HR than anywhere else. Other places have dealer robots who throw out cards and never utter a word. I hate that. HR dealers are all generally friendly and like chatting with you. A friendly dealer eases the pain of losing money. (My only complaint is that I went on a Monday and Tuesday afternoon\/night\/early morning and there were very few tables open. Like 4 blackjack tables, and half had weird rules.)

Plus, since it is off the strip there are a lot fewer tourists wandering in with no idea how to play blackjack. Any losers are generally voted off the table. 

Rooms? Clean rooms with comfy beds. Works for me.

He room was fine but a lot of little things that disappoint. Shower leaked all over the floor. Door frames and doors beat up and not repaired and the room was tough to get cool.

Cons:
-It took over half an hour to check in due to the extremely long line, and only 3 people working the counter. For the love of mike, PLEASE plan your staffing to accommodate a Friday check-in. This long line meant we had to forego having dinner before our concert
- Room Service Sunday morning took an hour and a half despite being told 45 minutes. 
- Their room service food is like mediocre cafeteria food, and they add a 20% tip but seem to have forgotten to tell the room service server who stands waiting for more.
- Pat downs to get into a concert, and no chains allowed on wallets. I do NOT trust a Vegas concert crowd, and having a small chain on my wallet means I still HAVE a wallet at the end of the night.
- After getting a late checkout, we still had an employee banging on our door at 11am on the nose telling us we were being charged for another day. Communicate with your people!

This place is more for a party crowd and not an old fogey or family crowd. You will hear noise and in a way the music from the pool area became an informal alarm clock. Music usually starts around 10 and gets cranked up around 11. Our room has a view to the pool area where we can people watch from the 6th floor. 

We loved the room. It was stylish and the beds were comfy too. Staff was always cool to us and never had a problem. We enjoyed their slots too and I won bucks from the quarter slots. I prefer to play the cheap ones as I don't feel guilty losing money I can't afford to lose.

Prices vary depending on day and time of year. We would have stayed longer but the EDC party jacked up the hotels all over Vegas and Henderson. Our room we paid 99-199 a night went to $499 Saturday night due to EDC. Nonetheless we would recommend this place to stay.

A couple of pointers in this area... one is if you need home comforts, booze or otherwise, head over to the CVS which is practically across the street to sort that out for you. Do note that the booze doesn't go on sale there like other CVS locations yet is way cheaper than the hotel rate for booze.

Hard Rock followed suit with Mandalay, Ph, MGM and built up suite towers to help set themselves apart. They started naming themselves ""cool"" names like Ph, HRH, Skylofts, Signature etc. =D HRH is about 1.5miles from the main strip. 

I nearly SWOONED when I walked into our suite. It could not get any more freakin' fantastic (well, I guess it could but for $90\/night...)

... Built in music console on the wall 
   A touch screen console next to the table that has super great rock, oldies, and pop music play lists built in. Hubby & I rocked out to Blink 182 songs and some other ""oldies"" once we got in!

...Super comfortable king bed w\/ down pillows 
    WOW. WOW... and WOW. It's so comparable to the bed we have at home. I slept SO well.. super comfy... it was even topped with a down mattress topper (haha... yeah, we opened it up and checked the listed materials). 

...HUGE bathroom
   separate toilet, shower, and soaking tub. I LOVED the grooves.. loved the lighting. loved everything. This could be its own room in it of itself! Shower could definitely fit 3-4 people in it!!! lol Loved the toiletries! 

...Furniture 
  SQUEAL! ... Large leather sectional. I jumped up and down on them hehe. =P 2 flat screen tvs... you know in case you want to watch something the other person doesn't! 

...POOL AREA 
   WOW . I was impressed. Huge adult lounge pools (4-5). Music was playing from above too ...loved it! It felt like being at a beach club w\/o cover. 

BUT... I did not like people drinking in the pool (ugh) and that there were SO MANY PEOPLE there (could barely move around)...on Sundays it's used for their beach club Rehab. This pool is not kid friendly (bouncer wouldn't let me in unless I showed him my ID!)


PARKING -- FREE SELF PARK. HRH has its own parking lot on the south side (don't park in the Hard Rock casino\/hotel area as it's quite a distance to traverse). 

RESORT FEE is $15\/day which includes internet access. 
Use of the gym is extra though (first time I heard of that)... only time I haven't used a gym at a hotel!!! 


I love just love the vibe of this place ... from its off the wall rocked out decor, to the interesting people, to seeing cool memorabilia, to the awesome views.... a definite must stay! Will definitely return!",6,5,6

We stayed just couple days before Thanks Giving. As soon as we arrived at this location we realised our goof-up!! Half of the main entrance was closed down for repairs\/renovations. First impression - Uh-oh!! Not good! 
The check-in staff was very friendly and we were served and in our room in under 20mins! We let the check-in staff know of our intentions of checking out 4 days earlier as the hotel isn't on the strip and thats what we wish - they upgraded us to the newer Paradise tower! That was very thoughtful indeed! The room itself was well appointed with modern furnishings and a pool view but no bath-tub!
Turns out, coz of Thanks Giving holidays, there weren't many decently priced rooms available on the strip in our choice of Hotels. 
So we decided to stay put. We did receive varying degree of customer service with little attention to detail from the house-keeping staff. 
1. On day one, we had requested extra sets of towels for our family of 4! We had to repeat these instructions every morning. 
2. House-keeping would replenish the toiletries without putting any mind to put it. One day we would get three bottles of shampoos but no body soaps :(
3. The weighted snack bar was a nightmare!!! Our toddler could have knocked half the things over!! Even after repeated requests from day 1 no one showed up\/wished to take away that wretched snack tray!! 
4 Though the staff was kind enough to provide us a complimentary mini-fridge (not minibar) to store my kiddos' milk. Appreciate it!

However, our biggest disappointment came after we checked out on 5th day and headed towards Grand Canyon. We realised around 7pm that we had forgotten my husbands' snow jacket and my shoes back at the room - in one of the closets. We called the hotel and the lost n found dept\/team told us that the room hasn't been cleaned yet so they don't know if anything was left behind!! Knowing that we were heading into the snow storm we were very desperate to recover the 4XL jacket!! (No, we don't get THAT size of snow jacket easily in any shop) The lost n (never) found team requested us to call back the next day. We had to follow up on three different days to see if they found the jacket and shoes!! We were told there wasn't anything left behind in our room! I am dead sure that those shoes n jacket was never picked up by us from the closet when we checked out!! (LV wasn't snowing for the past 5 days that we could have left it behind somewhere) :(
Well, thanks to the dodgy house-keeping staff we never saw our winter wear back and were left to freeze in the snow!!

We were so so disappointed with lost jacket experience of our stay at Hard Rock Hotel that we won't be returning here!!

May be the management want to have a ""Hard"" look at their house-keeping staff!",1,1,1

The shower does not drain quickly. No one likes to stand around in dirty shower water.

Roommate taking a shower and you need to use the restroom? No problem, there was a restroom right across the hall to use along with a drinking fountain. Never have seen that before!

If you are a light sleeper and sleep during the day, I do not recommend any rooms that face the pool as you will hear the pounding beats from the pool dj. I'm a heavy sleeper and I fell asleep quickly after being awake 27 hours in a 24 hour period and I tend to go to sleep with my radio on, so this wasn't a problem to me. My roommate on the other hand, couldn't sleep and complained about the music.

Sadly, Hard Rock Hotel is no longer the place to see and be seen other than Rehab on Sundays at the pool. The gaming floor is pretty empty and no longer the packed with people, fun place it once used to be when I played there in the 90's

The casino did a great job with the expansion and I enjoy the music played in the background throughout the casino, but it's no longer a place I would want to play for any length of time.

I wasn't too happy with the service I received at their 24 hour cafe, Lucky's 24\/7, but I'll write about that in a separate review.

I read some news a while ago that Hard Rock had a new President and was going to change things around at the Vegas location. So I decided to drop by and check them out. 

The decor is bright and welcoming. And the atmosphere is much nicer than before. 

When I first visited this casino, (a few years back) it was small. Like you could walk around the whole place in about 10 minutes.  Now, they've expanded to where the casino has another room which includes tons of slot machines, more tables, and a baccarat salon. :) Their sportsbook is pretty awesome as well. (see my review on Hard Rock Hotel Sportsbook)

Gambling is fun there as well. The casino dealers and pit bosses are nice as well. 

If you can, check out the Artist Hall. It's pretty cool too. They have tons of pics of many famous artists. And some pretty cool guitars too. 

At night, this place becomes one big social scene. Some say it's where all the cool kids hang out.. But everyone should come at least once for the experience. 

Maybe sometime I'll actually stay here. I've heard good things.

Arrived on a Wednesday, foot traffic in the hotel was light and registration line went fairly quickly. As I said I upgraded to a suite in the HRH tower. When I arrived in the room it had a strong odor of marijuana even though I was told it had just been cleaned and was ready for me. I found a marijuana pipe sitting right next to the ice bucket (how could housekeeping miss that and the smell?). I was put in a different suite, this time a corner suite and was not impressed for the money. The light switches only partially worked and obviously at the wayyy end of the hallway.

Hard Rock had ""Warped Tour"" on Friday which meant loads of kids everywhere (sitting on the floor all over the place near restaurants eating food and generally being unsupervised by anyone). It also closed down one of the pools I wanted to and paid to use that day.

Last but not least is the distance from the strip and other hotels. It was a $9.00 uber each way each time we wanted to go to the strip.

We arrived at 10pm on Thanksgiving night and were swiftly and courteously checked in by the staff.  We were assigned our room in the Paradise Tower (newer but farther from the casino).  The room was more spacious than I expected, the linens and beds were nice, and there was a big screen TV.  Off to a good start.

We headed down to the casino floor and began gambling. Charming dealers and box men\/women had us in stitches all night and one of my friends even won a good deal of money. The drinks and cards kept coming at a solid pace, and despite minor financial woes and liver damage, we were no worse for the wear. We had a blast that first night and stayed out until the sun was high in the morning sky.

The next night was a similar experience, though this time with a trip to the hotel's steakhouse, Rare 120.  While the meat was undercooked (leaving me to think that the place was aptly named), the service was good, the apps were delicious, and they were happy to oblige us by bringing over another table when two ladies joined us mid-dinner.  Also, thanks to our gaming on the previous night, the dinner was comped.  

Later that evening, a friend of one of the gentlemen I was traveling with came to visit us at the hotel.  We met him outside, he came in and sat down for some blackjack.  Next, the three of us got up from the table to head to the bathroom.

Once in the bathroom, we were approached by a uniformed police officer with a dog.  Cornered and without means of exit, he asked for our IDs and had them photocopied.  When asked the meaning of this shakedown, he replied ""It's private property, we don't need a reason.""  But it became painfully obvious what the reason was.  Our friend who came to visit us, who is an Emmy award winning actor, by the way, was black. Myself and my other friend who was present were white. Plain as day, abject racism that was the only conceivable reason for such a ridiculous use of intimidation.

As a hotel guest and someone who had spent thousands of dollars in their establishment, I was mortified.  They let us go on our way, and we headed back up to the room to bid our friend a good evening.  Ten minutes later, he called to tell us that when he went back downstairs he was asked to leave. ""Private property,"" they told him.

The next morning we spoke with the floor manager, who assured us that everything was done according to their ""code"".  I suppose their code includes singling out black people for humiliation and ejection from the premises.

Despite everything else in the weekend being near perfect, I will never ever return to the Hard Rock because of the racism and humiliation I experienced as a guest there.  I suggest you stay away as well.",7,2,0

To that point - if you want to be close to the strip, then stay on the strip. HRH is not on the strip (about a 15-20 min walk) and the shuttles don't run that often. For a R&R solo trip, I chose the HRH because I got a good midweek deal and didn't have much need to hang out every moment on the strip. All up, I had a pretty enjoyable experience here. I had a pretty much hassle free check-in and check-out experience and every single staff member was friendly and helpful. The room was huge especially for just myself and major pluses for the plush and comfy bed. I slept so well every night. My room had zero view but the hotel probably doesn't have a view of much anyway unless you're staying in the new HRH Towers. The pools are adequate but definitely show their age plus they fill up by Noon so get there early. Decent dining selection but perhaps not the most exciting and diverse by Vegas standards. The casino has a decent selection of slots and never felt too crowded or smokey.

Aside from that I probably have been visiting a few times a year whether to eat and\/or gamble for the past decade. Overall those visits were ok. So I can't vouch anything recently to do with the hotel side. This review would fall under the 'casino' side of Hard Rock. Specifically regarding the poker room.
Before the new poker room opened recently, they intially had one opened near the old parking garage side by Pink Taco. I had gotten a security box there on 9\/15\/09, which required a $100 deposit. It was fairly busy at first, but it wasn't long before the number of players started dwindling. Upon one visit(I think late 2010\/early 2011) found it empty. I walked around to find an employee who could tell me if the room was closed. I got to the main casino floor and managed to catch the pit boss on duty and asked. He said that the poker room closed and couldn't really tell me what happened to the boxes. Most of my inquiring was whenever I visited Hard Rock I would inquire. Next visit I believe I asked the front desk and gotten same answer, they didn't know. I do realize I am also at fault since I didn't aggressively push the issue at first. I kinda figured at the time it wasn't that big a deal that was like an emergency long as I got it taken care of sometime. Dumb move on my part. Only last month did I finally figure I should try to email them since obviously nobody there seemed to be able to tell me anything. So I went onto their website and sent a formal email inquiry on May 15th. I basically outline what I mentioned above and do also state that I do still have my deposit receipt and key. I get the immediate auto-response email saying I will be contacted soon by a HR rep. I wait 3 weeks and nothing. So I sent a 2nd email inquiry on 6\/6 rehashing what I wrote in the first email and asking why it would take 3 weeks to even get some kind of response. I actually get a response the next day on 6\/7 from Sarah(thankfully someone there is helpful), a Poker room supervisor. She tells me she is told my box has already been drilled open and my deposit was used to cover the cost of materials and labor. And if I required further assistance to contact Mike Decker, director of the casino cage. I did tell her I appreciated her response and will do. I do email Mr. Decker right after just to ask when this occured, out of curiosity. I am still waiting on a response to that email.

Erm.

What turns me off the most about the Hard Rock are the type of clientele it attracts.  It's the kind of place where you feel compelled to check your drink for roofies every few minutes, or at least it's the type of place where I feel compelled to do that.

If you're into clubs, this might be more your scene.  If you're looking for something more, this'll probably just be a place to sleep.

There is interesting Rock & Roll memorabilia all over the place, they are almost always playing good music, and the crowd likes to have a good time.  Oh, yeah, and the pool is the BOMB.  

I'm a fan of the gaming floor in that it's not overwhelming.  It's large enough for a good party, but not too large that you get lost in it.  Places like the MGM, Bellagio, Paris, etc, gimme a break.  It's like a clusterfukc in those places sometimes.  The Hard Rock's gaming floor is a circle, and easy to navigate.  And in the center of the circle?  A bar. 

I do like to venture out and check the Vegas sights now and again, but when I come back at 5am, it's so nice to walk into the always friendly Hard Rock.

The Hard Rock boasts some sweet restaurants.  The 24 hour diner is nice for the 3am munchies, or the 10am breakfast.  No better sushi in Vegas than NOBU.  Italian eats at AGO.  Happy Hour Mexican at the Pink Taco.

I've been to the Hard Rock a couple of times to see concerts (Franz Ferdinand, Kings of Leon) at the Joint, and it's so nice to be able to just jaunt up to your room and mix a drink or whatever before or after the show and be right back in the thick of it when you come down.

The Paradise Tower is worth the extra money so that you get the pool view - it's better than the ""Mountain View"" which is actually a view of the parking lot.  Also, check hotels.com for some good deals on bookings...

I'm just gonna say it:  If you like to party, this is the spot to be.",2,1,2

I will never ever stay in one of their rooms ever again, even if it was free. 
We liked what the whole Hard Rock theme and history of the place was. But sadly in today's Las Vegas they give low quality service at a low budget resort. Now it's just a place of things that used to be. And I gave this place 1 star too many. They should change the name to Hardly Rock.",4,1,1

I've had awesome experiences at all the 4 star hotels I normally stay at on the strip, but this hotel or at least the ""casino tower"" rooms are NOT 4 star rooms. First of all when we checked in we asked for a non-smoking room. When we got up to our room in the casino tower I immediately smelled smoked. We called down saying our room smells like smoke when our room was non-smoking. The person told us we were in a smoking room and they would change us into a non-smoking room, but at the moment there weren't any non-smoking king rooms available so we were given a room with two full size beds. They told us we could switch into a non-smoking king the next day. *sigh* There shouldn't be this much hassle for a 4 star hotel!! Now about the rooms, the room itself was decent, but the heater\/AC was so loud (boom, boom, boom) at first i thought our room was above a nightclub!! Thank god i brought ear plugs with me or i would've been mad! The bathrooms are very dated! The white light fixture plates were filthy with dirt in between the switch. You could tell the bath tub had been recaulked several times, and the doors have been painted (sloppy) multiple times. Yes I'm a bit OCD so these things bother me lol.

We were charged the resort fee, which seems a bit ridiculous, but I guess someone's gotta pay for that pool maintenance. 

The rooms were really nice and spacious.  I liked the double tv and the touch screen music on the wall- pretty cool.  The bed was also really comfortable!  However on the negative I would say the rooms were pretty dirty.  I found someone's blonde hair extension on the couch and there was piece of cardboard under the chair in the bedroom the entire time we were there (clearly no one vacuumed!).  Additionally, the bathroom wasn't that clean (had someones left over hair everywhere) and the showers suck!!!  The bathroom looks really nice, but the shower barely spits out any water and I don't think the overhead and shower head are suppose to be on at the same time- if they are- it's the worst fancy shower I've ever used!  

Also don't go to the bar because it is way over priced!  Additionally, the crowd here reminds me of kids on spring break (not that I'm a super old fart, but I felt pretty close to being one).  Oh and for those who do stay here, there is a shuttle that takes you to parts of the stip.  We never were able to take the shuttle.  The first time we tried it never came, the second time we probably just missed it.  The cab fare to the strip is about $10 for two people.

Sometimes it's nice just to go on vacation and have a fridge\/microwave so you can buy groceries and just eat a bit healthier and that's nearly impossible since there are no microwaves or fridges. Mr. Luck y'all has delicious food, though, if you're looking for a bite to eat. DJ at the restaurant has excellent customer service skills and Chef Felton was very accommodating, as well. 

Okay let's talk about the good: beautiful pool, tons of restaurants, shops, and everything\/anything you might need inside the hotel. 

What kinda sucks: OVERLY PRICED ALCOHOL at the Vanity Pool--I paid $30 for a blended drink and it was not very strong at all. The worst part is they don't allow any outside drinks--people are already paying hundreds of dollars to stay at your damn hotel, let them drink what they want to bring. My advice if you want to ""sneak"" your drink in, is use a ""hard rock"" cup because they can't say it's an ""outside drink"". It also gets pretty crowded so you have to go early and get a spot. 

The actual atmosphere of the hotel is pretty cool, aside from the fact that you'll see females going to the pool like they're going to the Grammy's with dresses and heels on but hey it's Vegas and you gotta look good!

1. A\/C doesn't work. Even though thermostat is set at 70, room won't go below 77.  The tech came right away and replaced the clogged filter.
2. There is no luggage stand. They came about 20 minutes later with a stand.
3. While there is an ice bucket, there are no glasses (the coasters are there though).  Got them 20 minutes later.
4. Not enough hangers for our clothes. When we call for more hangers, the guy shows up about 20 minutes later with towels. We told him we needed hangers, so 20 minutes later he shows up with three (we had initially asked for 7-8).  After waiting another 20 minutes (do you see a pattern here?), we finally left to go get some dinner. They were waiting for us when we returned.
5. The shower doesn't drain.  Same tech as for #1 showed up right away and cleared it for us.
6. Every time we call guest service, it takes forever for someone to answer (literally, several minutes waiting for someone to pick up).
7. The cable service is flaky. We can't even watch a movie without the picture and sound going out sporadically. Didn't bother to call for this one as I know how that will turn out.
8. To the hotel's credit, they did credit us the upgrade fee and offer to move us to another room in the newest part of the hotel, but who wants to pack up and move at 10:30 at night.

And to top it off, we left our room in the morning and returned at almost 5 pm, and the room still hadn't been made up, so in addition to beefing up their phone answering personnel, they need additional housekeeping staff too.

Other things to note:
- $7ish cab to the Strip - not bad
- $9ish cab to\/from the airport
- Beds in the HRH Tower Suites, as other reviewers have mentioned, are FREAKING AMAZING
- Bathroom is also amazing. HUGE shower, HUGE tub. You know, if you're dirty.

The room is extremely dark. Good thing I don't wear makeup because you couldn't see anything in the bathroom. Could barely see the soap I showered with. The lights at the night stand were both out and the alarm was left on (check these things, people!) so I had a friendly 5:37 a.m. wakeup buzz.

The mandatory resort fee was $22 per night or so, and didn't include a seat by the pool, which requires that you spend wads of cash on food and drink for the privilege of sitting on a chair. I was shooed away at 10:30 a.m. when no one else was there because I wouldn't plunk down the cash.

The ""free"" pool closes at 6 p.m. Stupid, like the hours for the gym, which is only open from like 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.

The big deal-breaker is that they don't have coffee makers in the room, like most casino hotels. I always thought that a hotel in Vegas with a coffee maker and bright lights in the rooms could make a fortune.

P.S. Not impressed by the rock-and-roll memorabilia.",9,1,3

I read on-line that the slot\/video poker payouts were better at the HardRock than the places on the strip. So, after asking one of the cops standing and watching folks walking up and down the strip, we decided to try it. 
The cop said ""it's just two lights east of Las Vegas Blvd"".
Well, it was more like four lights, and it is one HELL of a trek between the 3rd and 4th light. Like almost a mile. Wouldn't walk again.
We were met by the surly waitstaff described above. Seriously, we were nearly praying for a waitress to stop by our slot machine to ask if we wanted something to drink after that hike. No one ever came by after like an hour, so I went to the bar and asked for water. Turns out that, although alcohol drinks are free, water costs $3 at the bar. Although the water would be free if delivered by one of their non-existent cocktail waitresses. 
And the female bartender ignored me after we bought 3 waters at $3 each.  Like I had pissed her off. She wouldn't even look my way or ask if I wanted something else even though I sat at the bar playing $1 video poker for a couple of hours.

The exterior of the hotel is deceiving. Don't let the huge neon guitar influence your thinking that this place is some cheesy tourist venue.

Well, there is some cheese but not enough to make you queasy.

The interior is chock full of gambling machines\/tables and rock memorabilia. It's pretty amazing some of the clothing and photos they have posted on the walls.

Decent music is playing throughout the casino at all times.

There are many restaurants and shops scattered throughout the hotel, though I didn't get a chance to visit any except for Starbucks -- my company arranged for the meals. (The Starbucks did make a surprisingly good cup of coffee though.)

Our conference rooms were well arranged and served with great buffet food. All attendants were attentive and polite.

My room was in the Paradise Tower and very hip. It was clean and tastefully arranged. The colors were dark and very rock-star like. I loved the huge shower.

The only negative here was my restricted view of the Strip and mountains by the parking deck.

I would also caution more conservative folks to avoid Sunday afternoon and the Rehab party at the pool. It felt like Spring Break in Panama City Beech.

Also, the Strip is a moderate walk (15 minutes) away from the hotel. I made the trip twice and found the trip safe in both the day and night.

Really cheap compared to other Vegas Hotels, and if you book early enough.

Location:
Really depends who you are. If you want the hustle and bustle of the Strip, do not come here. But if you're more chill, and want something more relaxed, then HRH is definitely for you. It's located a couple blocks from the Strip, so you would definitely have to take a taxi every time you go out of the hotel, which could be a pain in the back!

Room:
We stayed in a 2 Queen Bed Suite. I really liked the design and layout, room was really spacious and could easily accomodate 6 people comfortable (4 people on the 2 queen beds, and 2 people on the long and large sofa in the living space). Bathroom was extremely large, with a glass wall, but there are curtains for privacy during showers. I also liked how the toilet has its own separate space from the bathroom, that way people can use the bathroom without being exposed to the toilet. 

FREE WIFI! YES!

Casino:
Because HRH is so far from the strip, the crowd here is definitely older, and more looking to relax. I liked playing the tables here more than the strip because you don't have your serious gamblers, just people looking to have a fun quiet time at the tables. Also the waitresses are more attentive since it's not that crowded.  

Overall:
I'd stay at the HRH again, but it's not my first choice. It's not the best place for young people looking to go out to the clubs, because I hated taking the taxi so much or not having the ability to walk the strip and explore other casinos.",1,0,0

Pros:
1. The staff - Whether you're at the casinos, restaurants, or checking in the staff always had a great attitude and were very helpful.
2. Restaurants - The restaurants in the hotel served great food. Most were pricey but food was tasty. 
3. Pool - The pool area was beautiful and I loved how there was sand on the bottom of the pool. Also, there is always a great DJ playing when you want to just hang by the pool side.

Cons:
1. The SMELL! Ugh. As soon as you walk in you get hit with the most trashiest perfume smell. It's so nauseating and makes the hotel smell dirty.
2. HOUSEKEEPING (Big problem) - We stood for 6 nights and out of those 6 nights, housekeeping cleaned our room 4 times and when I say cleaned I mean just made the bed. The garbage was overflowing by the time we were leaving but got taken out only once in the beginning of the week.
3. Non-relaxing: Don't get me wrong I love to party, however, after the party I like to walk to my room with more of a relaxing feel. This hotel is no place to relax what so ever. It's obnoxiously loud and trashy. So, if you're looking for a nice relaxing hotel atmosphere this is definitely not it.",0,0,0

My wife and I stayed for the restaurant and bar show March 7-10, 2016 and booked our room back in December, 2015.  This is the letter sent to them close to 30 days ago with no call back or apology to this date:
Bad customer service to say the least, our bill has been messed up ever since too!

Upon our close to 5 hour drive from Temecula, Ca. we arrived at your WONDERFUL oasis, HRH Las Vegas for the Restaurant and Bar show at the LV convention center. We arrived at approx 3:45 and valet our car and promptly went to the front to check in, upon check in we were lucky enough to have Jewel check us in, a true pleasure and a great salesperson. She offered us an upgrade to a suite for only $50 more a night, what a great deal....we never get away from our 60+ hour work weeks at our restaurant! We proceeded to go up to the upgraded room in the Casino tower and upon entering we realized the room was too big, kind of cold and not to our liking. We promptly called down stairs & explained we didn't really like the room and to come back down, they said no problem. Upon going back down we now had Larry (if we remember correctly) and he explained that no Casino tower non-smoking queen beds were now available. I said we just want our regular room back, and he again apologized that indeed there were none available with the exact needs we wanted (we booked this in Dec). This was literally 10 minutes later....So, upon saying the best he could do was a casino 2 queen non smoking room, we would get the King bed the next few nights I said ok without checking with my wife. He also said they would text us when it was ready. It was after 4pm already....I then left informed my wife told her what was going on and we both came back and talked to yet another agent, and said we were a little upset, we never get away and just want our room now. It was after Deion the manager was called over that we now offered a room in the HRH suites area. Not knowing what this was we saw a quick IPAD picture presentation and said, yes this was ok for the trip. We thanked Deion and Larry again and we shook hands, he informed us the 1st day Resort Fee would be covered too, we said thank you very much!

We got to the room, room 11122. The room was spacious, clean and to our liking for sure. Karen and I were happy, so we thought. Anyhow, each night (all 3) we stayed we called on room 11120 because they were loud with there music in the room. This was between 9pm and 11pm ish. The safe didn't work and called security, the music system didn't work at all and the speaker below the TV was broken the engineer told us. We also called engineering because the shower was leaking and the shower head was loose and we had to actually shower one handed as well. 

We own our own business and realize customer service is paramount to success in the hospitality industry. I've been in this industry for 28 years! If you don't know of this you can't fix it, plain and simple. Our trip always seemed to be at the front desk, on the phone, waiting for a security officer, waiting for engineering and calling on very loud neighbors every single night of our trip. Honestly a pain in the rear and very time consuming and irritated to say the least. We simply wanted to let you know, so it can be fixed.

Compared to the behomoths on the Strip there is a lot less to offer gambling wise. There was a lot of blackjack and slot machines and a huge area for sports betting.  For the average poker player (aka NOT high limit tables), there is not much here for you.

There are like 4 levels of security to get in, and the people at every stage treat you like guards inprocessing you into prison. I guess they're doing me a favor by being there, it's not their job and I'm not paying to stay there and use the pool. Really shitty experience. They don't have signs saying what to do or show at each level so as you think you're done and walk further a couple people sitting on their ass will yell at you like inconvenienced parents yelling at a child to show ID or room key or some combination of the two that you've already shown at the stage before them.  Then there are no seats anywhere because every one is ""reserved"" but no one ever comes to claim them (I don't blame them). The blackjack dealers are super unprofessional and talk amongst themselves during deals and between hands. It's crazy. Don't stay here, you'll be pissed at yourself. Oh and they tack a $35 ""resort fee"" onto your bill so the great deal you think you're getting, isn't a deal at all. Seems like it should be illegal, but what do I know.",3,0,0

I went in June and they sent me a 30% discount for my next stay which is cool. 

Room: 
Both times I've gone we booked the mountain view room w\/ 2 queen beds and were upgraded to pool view when we checked in, so we had a nice view of the strip as well. Comfy beds, but I wish they kept the purple comforters. Now they're just boring white. 
(p.s. We overheard the booking girl trying to charge a group for pool view when we were leaving which was shady b\/c it was a Wed...were they so close to full capacity they had to start charging? I won't knock a star for it, but didn't seem right.) 

Price:
In June, we booked M-W for $60\/night--the price of Motel6! Last spring I believe it was also very reasonable, maybe $80-90\/night for Sun-T. It's most expensive summer weekends b\/c of Rehab pool party.  

Fun: 
- Awesome pool with swim-up blackjack, plenty of lounge space and a nice little waterslide no one ever uses; you can rent cabanas w\/ mist 
- Body English is a fun club--girls dressed in Schoolgirl outfits drink free champagne on Sundays...we considered dressing up but felt way too awkward
- Rock music they play is a nice change if you're listening to Akon and Lil Wayne at the clubs every night 
- ""Relax Mondays"" at the pool was cool--DJ Que was spinning tracks from Kaskade and Tiesto which I loved 

Food: 
- Mr. Lucky's is open 24\/7; it has delicious breakfasts like french toast & the veggie omelette 
- Pink Taco is good for happy hour
- Nobu if you win big and want to celebrate with fine sushi",3,1,3

I""ve stayed there several times throughout the years, never had very good customer service, but this last trip was by far the worst.  The employees are complete morons, and did not care to make our stay pleasant.   It seemed every time I had a question I always got a different answer from your employees.  It was absurd!!  How can they not all be on the same page and provide accurate information?

List of complaints:
1. Checking in was a complete pain.  They had our rooms all mixed up between the two parties we were with.  The guy finally had our rooms somewhat situated, but three out of four were still  not ready to check into at 3pm.  No big deal, but we went back to see if they were ready later, and two different girls looked at our reservation and told us we had one room less than we did, and the rooms we were waiting for still weren't ready. We went to the pool and decided to deal with the missing room later or just cram more people in the rooms we already had.  Finally by 6pm, the rooms were all ready, and the extra room we were told we had then didn't have, magically appeared again. 

2. Once our rooms were finally situated, my friend went to take a shower and the shower head was loose and fell on her face.  Maintenance had to come up and fix it since the screw was completely loose.  How would housekeeping not notice this before we checked in?!  This totally put my friend in a bad mood and wasted a good hour of our time the first night since the hotel  made her file a report, etc.  They had no problem wasting her time to file a report, but they never once asked if she was okay or if she needed anything.  Luckily she didn't end up with a black eye

3. Saturday at the pool: Hard Rock now swipes your ID for you to enter so if your name isn't listed on the room, you can't go in.  Funny that I called in advance on this and asked again when we checked in, and their uneducated staff told me that all you need is your room key to get in the pool on Sat.  So not the case!  We got up there with our group and couldn't get in half our group because they weren't listed on the room.  We explained we had 5 rooms total under one person and we hadn't added all the names.  They said we couldn't add them at the pool but would have to go all the way to the lobby and come back.  My friend's were pissed and gave up and went back to the family pool where we had a cabana.  Yes, on top of that, we actually had a cabana but it didn't matter.  I complained to another employee near the pool and he went ahead, called the front desk, and added one of my other friend's to the room so she could go in.  So the girl working at the pool was rude and wouldn't do it for us and caused half our group to leave, but the guy at the pool next to her helped one of my friend's out, but it was too late for the other's since they were already turned away. 

4.  Sunday (Rehab) at the pool:  I also called ahead of time before we arrived to make sure that we get two wristbands per room.  We had a couple staying in one room, and they were told that even though they get two wristbands per room and there were two of them, the husband had to still pay to get in since he's a guy.  I have never heard of something so ridiculous in my life!!!!! What is wrong with this hotel?!  It's absolutely unbelievable! So we decided to skip Rehab.  Why waste our money at HRH anyway.  We had a friend staying at Palazzo and the pool was gorgeous, they were welcoming with a friendly staff, and it wasn't a complete fire drill to get into the pool.

5. To top the cake, we called on Monday morning to get a late checkout, and we were able to get a noon checkout free of charge, but 3pm checkout would cost us an additional $60.  My friend politely told them that we had 5 rooms from Friday-Monday, and we only wanted a 3pm checkout for one of the rooms on Monday. The girl wasn't helpful.  I called back to speak to a manager, and Monica, an assistant manager, was rude and unhelpful.  I explained all the issues we had throughout the weekend, and she asked me why I hadn't addressed those issue at the time they happened.  I told her we did address some of them, but didn't get very far.  She asked who I had spoken to.  I told her I didn't make a note of every person I spoke to, nor did I really have the time and energy to devote to taking care of issues that I shouldn't be dealing with to begin with when you are paying to stay somewhere.  I was at a bachelorette party in Vegas for crying out loud.  I'm not a 80 year old woman who has nothing better to do than complain every second the hotel doesn't accomodate me.  I asked to speak with someone above Monica, and she said that she could give me his email.  I told her to go ahead and give us the 3pm checkout and to charge us, and that would be the last fee I pay that hotel as I will never go there again!!!  She did  not care that our group was completely unhappy with our stay.",6,1,1

I was the best man, so I was in charge of booking everything. The hotel itself was great, but the customer service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. I use work in the hotel industry and I know that the lackluster service I received is something that a customer should never have to endure, especially with a group of my size(12 guys) who booked 6 rooms and spent well over 8k on accommodations, food and drink,and on the Rehab pool party. The issue from the start was from a check in error at the front desk. I booked the rooms through booking.com, but since I had multiple bookings, the hotel claimed that there was an error and charged me for extra rooms that I did not book. This issue was supposedly resolved at the hotel, after I spent well over an hour at the front desk during my stay working with a manger, who was the only employee that I have spoken with that was helpful, to take of it. The issue was taken care of, supposedly and the rest of the stay went well, minus the horrible check out experience I received from a rude and inconsiderate front desk employee. Two weeks after I checked, I was charged yet again on my card for rooms that I did not book. When I called the hotel they informed me that it would be refunded to my card immediately. Nothing happened. At this point, I have spent over 3 hours in person, on the phone, and via email working to resolve this matter, and I keeping getting the run around from hotel employees in multiple departments. This makes absolute zero sense because all them have agreed and confirmed that this charge was not suppose to happen. I am appalled at the horrendous service that I have received and at the complete lack of consideration that the Hard employees have for my time. I have requested to speak with a GM and have been denied every time. I have stayed at the Hard Rock locations around the world and have always had a great experience. I am in the midst of planning another bachelor party and was planning on staying yet again at their location in Vegas, prior to this experience. I will never again give any of the Hard rock locations my business again. Hopefully the hotel will work on fixing and resolving such situations quicker and with better service in the future with other guests.",0,0,0

We were in the casino tower which wasn't as nice as the previous, it seemed like an older part of the hotel. The room wasn't as modern or nice. I will say we had a great view of the pools though. 
My biggest complaint is with the customer service upon checking out we had some big problems.  Our car was parked pretty far away from out room so we decided to take two trips to the car when packing our luggage. Trying to get back into our room at 10am we can't get in. Our key stopped working no lights on the lock even showed up, we asked a housekeeper to try her key and nothing happened no lights or anything. So we went down to the front desk there were only 2 front desk attendants and a really long line of people waiting to check in. 20min later we are helped by someone and they give us a new key thinking that will fix everything. NOPE we can't even get on the elevator with our new key which you need in order to get off the main floor. 
So back to the front desk waiting 30min and the front desk attendant was really rude and not listening to what I was saying and gives me a new new key. All I'm trying to do is check out of my hotel room but I still have things in my room. 
This time the key works on the elevator but not our room. So I use a house phone on our floor to call security they say the batteries on the door must be dead and they will send someone up. 45minutes later and a second phone call maintenance man comes up and no security and the guy helps us break into our room. 
This delay added nearly 2 hours to our departure Let me also say that this was a Tuesday morning it wasn't even a weekend. The way we were treated and the lack of help was unreal I was really disappointed to say the least! Also I had no clue the door key locks ran on batteries that is also crazy.",1,0,0

If there was one thing I was put off about, it was the sandy pool. It was like sand from Lowe's, it hurt my feet to walk on. Would've rather not had the sand at all. The sand's purpose was to make it SEEM like a beach, but knowing the difference, it only made it silly to have sand in the first place. I didn't like how the sand made the water look murky, not crystal clear. Meaning, the sand disguised a lot of dirt being brought into the pool. I can only imagine the problems Hard Rock has with the filtering system for that pool. I did swim to the center island, and noticed that the water was much clearer & cleaner beyond the island, on the other side. There were other pools, but they were either closed or filled to the brim with people, so we had no choice but the sandy pool the first day. The following day, we tried another pool, and it was a tad better but not a great atmosphere. There is just something missing .

Tip: Get up super-early (even before the pool opens) to stand in line with all the others, to snag your spot when they open the pools. Run...don't walk...to the area you want to sit and claim your chairs by placing your (inexpensive) belongings on the chairs. THEN go get breakfast and bring it out to the pool. It's the only way to get that perfect spot if you plan to spend most of the day.

Pools open early and close early. I never can understand why these hotels can't invest in lights for those who desire to swim in the evening (me). It's not just the Hard Rock that does this; they all do. Most close at 6pm; some at 7pm.

I did enjoy the Pink Taco restaurant, accessible just off the pool area, but it was pricey, even for Vegas. We had 2 beers each and an appetizer. 

Hart & Huntington has been around for a long time in Vegas, and if you are so inclined to get a tattoo while in Vegas, I highly recommend this world-acclaimed tattoo parlor.

While sitting & sunning poolside, we ordered  a bucket of 6 beers. Lying there with your bucket of beers, filled with ice, a couple of chairs located nearest the water, soaking up the sun, with not a care in the world, is a very good day in Vegas. We started a game, rubbing ice on each other to cool off. Once we reached the bottom of the bucket and finished the beers, we took turns dumping the ice cold water on one another ;) *Squeeee*

I must mention that the Hard Rock Cafe attached to the hotel has one of the best burgers I've ever had. There is another Hard Rock Cafe located on the strip, and that location is newer. They have a rock climbing wall at the strip location as well.

Enter the evening and the scene generally gets a little more lively. I didn't find the Hard Rock as lively as I would've liked. This is most likely cause this hotel is located off the strip. We found ourselves getting in the car and driving to the strip, where all the major activity is.",5,3,2

My name was not on the room so I could not extend the stay without having my boyfriend go down to the front desk. So then I made a separate reservation and they put it under the wrong name so I couldn't even check in to my reservation. We decided to go elsewhere for our last night.",1,1,0

I talk to the AFRICAN AMERICAN security or whatever he is he thinks he owns this place and felt an anxiety from him. I felt harassed and discriminated by this place and I don't recommend the Hard Rock to anyone bad customer service and the staff needs to be retrained.,2,2,2

As I always start these reviews, allow me this one caveat: I am a business traveler and as such, I'm not in Vegas to gamble or party--- so, my reviews are going to be from that framework. Don't get me wrong, I go to all the restaurants, I like to go to shows, but obviously what I'm looking for is a little different than the crash pad I know a lot of Vegas tourists are looking for. 

Overall, I really do like the Hardrock. Why? 
#1: It's convenient. My office is right down the street from the Hardrock, so it's fantastic to stay on the same side of the Strip as my office and not have to worry about traffic on the 15 of LV Blvd. 
#2: It's clean. Seriously, that counts for a lot. A lot of the less than 5 star resorts reek of stale smoke and sadness. While people are smoking around the Hardrock, it's barely noticeable. 
#3: The wifi is consistent. You'd be surprised how many places in Vegas charge you $16 a day for internet that loads slower than molassas on a cold day. Now, I'm not saying the Hard Rock wifi is going to be ideal for streaming HD movies or anything, but it's great for surfing and checking email without any hiccups. 
#4: Easy in and out. The Hardrock has several parking structures and points of entrance, which is fantastic for someone like me. There's nothing I hate more than being in one of the old casinos in town where you have to park, then wind a mile through the casino to get to your room. The Hardrock is great for ease of access.

I think I've stayed in every room type at the Hardrock except the fancy pants suites (which, if you're reading this Hardrock, I'd be more than happy to try them out to review for you ;) ). So, here's my breakdown comparing:

*Basic casino room: I don't mind this room at all. It's a bit basic, but also funky and fun. Flat screen TV, comfy bed, clean bathroom. What I really like about this room, though? It has doors that open to the outside! This is *huge* for Vegas, because you're usually trapped inside without fresh air. I LOVE opening those doors after a long day in my office building. You can upgrade to a pool side view for more money, but I actually prefer the mountain side-- it's quieter (no thump thump thump bass from Rehab) and I enjoy looking out on the desert.

*Paradise Tower basic room: Nice enough, but I'm not sure I'd ever pay more for it. I usually only get this room when it's the same price as the casino tower. The room has a red theme, so it's a little  . . . heavy? I don't know if that's the right word. Anyway, the bathroom is black, which looks lovely but the lighting can make it a bit hard to do your makeup in the morning. You can also upgrade this room to a pool view, though I'm not sure I would.

*Paradise Tower corner suite: I got upgraded to this room the last time I was there. The room was much bigger, but basically the same as the basic paradise tower room. Lots of windows though, which was lovely. 

*HRH king suite: I really like staying at the HRH tower-- the dedicated valet and check in, private elevators, it's just great. The rooms are starting to get a little threadbare (couch padding is wearing down and getting less comfortable, for instance), but over all, I love the sitting area and bedroom. The bathroom is also phenomenal with a walk in steam shower with rain shower head and a separate soaking tub. Just great. You can upgrade this one to a pool view as well,  but by now you know my feelings on that.

*HRH corner suite: basically the same as the king suite, just at on of windows. Really awesome.

In order of the rooms I'd like, I'd say it goes: any of the HRH rooms, the casino tower, then the Paradise tower. I know the Paradise tower is supposed to be nicer than casino, but I just love the balcony set up. 

Hardrock's spa is also awesome and always running fantastic promotions, so be sure to check their website for deals.",3,1,0

The whole casino was pretty empty given that it was 4th of July weekend. Rooms were very nice and pretty big. Ours had a great partial view of the strip. No fridge, just a mini bar stocked with overpriced alcohol. Shower door leaked a ton of water on to the floor no matter which way we aimed the shower head. We also called housekeeping for extra towels and none ever got delivered. The cleaning ladies were only able to give us 2 hand towels, they swore they didn't have any bath towels on their cart. This place is farther from the strip then it looks, and it seems like kind of a seedy area. Really the only great things were the room & bed. 2 days after checkout my credit card was charged $94. When I called to find out why, they said it was the resort fee. I was told by the front desk there were no additional fees when I checked in (they took my cc # for a deposit). I won't ever stay here again. Now I know why it's so empty.",3,1,1

Additionally it would have been nice to know the room we will be staying in will look nothing like the picture online. The room looked directly into the parking garage. Barley any sun light in the room during the day. This room should have been pro rated, and we should have been made aware of the construction before arrival. I am very disappointed in the hotel and casino.

I would have given 5 stars except for a few things. We weren't directed to the HRH check in area and instead were greeted by a tired and cranky reception girl that didn't really care too much when I told her it was our honeymoon. I feel it would have been a nicer experience for both of us had she just directed us to the HRH tower check in area which we saw on the way to our room.  Room was plush and comfortable . We had a pool view which was nice.  Sucks that the pools were all closed except for two small ones.  Either way I recommend this for a off strip, luxury feel on a budget. :-)",0,0,0

We booked the trip through book it so I wasn't sure what to expect with the room. I initially thought we were going to get a room in the paradise tower. But when we got there they didn't have anymore rooms left in that tower, we had already expressed not wanting to stay in the casino tower whatsoever. So they upgraded us FREE of charge to a suite! 

The suite was beautiful. When it comes to bathrooms especially hotel bathrooms I'm like the pickiest person on earth! Our bathroom had a walk in shower with TWO shower heads, an overhead shower head and a removable shower head. The bathroom also had a really big + deep tub. The tub didn't have any jets which was a bummer but whatever. Also it had two sinks, the toilet had its own little room with a door you can close. 

They didn't have any complimentary air freshener though. 

There were two TVs in the room, one on the side where the bed was and the other on the living room side.

There was a really loud speaker system that I put to use every time I was in the room. You can connect your own music or listen to their library.

The room was clean, room service was really nice. 

However! I did notice that a lot of the cleaners and such didn't really speak too much English. Some of the room service people couldn't answer a lot of my questions because of the language barrier and that kind of sucked!

The pool is AMAZING! It seems like when there is an event going on you don't get to really enjoy the pool because it is too crowded. But if you're like me you should book your stay on a weekday and avoid the weekend crowd.

The memorabilia was by far my favorite! I love museums, so to be able to walk around the casino floor and see small informational pieces was really cool to me. 

There's a cvs right across the street that sells full bottle sized alcohol so don't waste your money drinking the nips they offer you in room. 

Staff was amazing they were more than willing to accommodate me.

They have a 24hr restaurant in there, I didn't eat there but everyone says it's pretty good. Their Asian restaurant is REALLY good. 

I definitely cannot wait to book my second Vegas trip with the Hard Rock.",0,0,0

I don't remember seeing any families or kids.

The pool over the hill past the cabana's and down the stairs was the perfect place for my 3 year old to play. The pool is about 1.5 feet deep and there is also a beach entry. The other pools also have beach entry, but I found that this pool was less crowded for him to play in. 

Not a fan of Mr Lucky's restaurant (or whatever the name is). Food was ok, service sucked. I don't expect them to cater to children, but I do expect them to notice that there is another person with me and maybe give him a napkin or silverware or something! 

The rooms are nice. Ours did not have a tub, just shower. There is a mini\/ snack bar on the counter in the room. If you MOVE anything on there, you will be charged. So best thing to do if you have no self control or if you have kids, just throw a jacket, sweatshirt or whatever over it! You will forget that is is even there!

She was so rash and insensitive. I asked for the manager and she says very rudely that she was and there was no one else so deal with it. I again requested her supervisor and she refused again. It's such a huge turn off. There was no apology for the construction when I arrived and the room I checked into had wet spots all over the floor.

I felt like an old lady looking for her glasses as I was constantly fumbling around for things in the room. ""Where are my shoes????!?"" ""I can't find my tank!!!!!!"" Everything went missing. We kept on trying to turn on lights and then realizing that all the lights were already on. Each one emitted like a 1% beam which did nothing to pierce the gloomy abyss. It doesn't help that all the furnishings, carpets, and paint are grey or black. My friend actually liked the decor (though she couldn't see either), but it made me feel like I was 80 years old.

Even the front desk is in the dark. Pair that with the super bright video screen behind it, and I'm assuming every person that works here is getting eye strain and headaches. 

We got a room in the Paradise Tower, which is towards the back of the hotel and in the conference section. It was really convenient to the parking structure, but it was a long walk to the front. I also found the card key slots in both the elevators and doors hard to use. I saw others struggling with them, too. There should be some staff walking the main floors as well, since on one late evening\/early morning, I was accosted by this drunk guy who was hell bent on walking me up to my room. 

The variety of pools is a plus, but understand that the main pool is a dayclub 24\/7, so you'll need your ID each time you enter. I made the mistake of not bringing mine the first day, so I had to walk all the way back to my room for my driver's license. Maybe it's obvious (obviously not to me, however), but the hotel should state this in the hotel booklet in the room. I browsed through that before heading down, and it didn't say anything about needing identification.",10,6,3

the husband decided this would be the place to stay for my first trip to vegas. (yes, i'm 30 and this was my first trip to vegas. what does that say about me? first, if you're judging me ask yourself how many times you've been and what that might say about you. ok smartie let's move on.) 

our room was spacious and clean and i loved the framed photos of icons. i wasn't a huge fan of their casino area. it's not as well ventilated or as pumped full of oxygen as the bellagio or venetian so if you're sensitive to smoke, it's gonna annoy you. i'm not a gambler tho so i just avoided it. 

the staff is nice and respectful and the pool is pretty cool with a fake beach and everything. you will definitely see girls with fake boobs and in g-strings here and they're always fun to watch as they angle for the attention of the nearest meatheads. we ate breakfast both mornings at mr lucky's which was solid if not impressive. the ""rehab"" breakfast was pretty good actually. 

also hit up their club--body english--which is free before midnite if you're a guest. thank God, cause being an SF girl i was not about to wait in a line to be judged on the size of my breasts or how pretty i am just to give some asshole $30 to let me into a club full of other assholes. give yourself pletny of time tho. there's a mob scene a at midnite all of them pleading with some ponytailed david beckham lookalike to let them in. body english played pretty fun music and there was great people watching here too.

day 1- we land in vegas, it's hot as fuck and we are not sober. we payed a ridiculous fee to be limo'd over to the hotel. inside the hotel, we check in and dump our bags in the room. we wait around for the rest of the bitches to arrive and we head out for the night. we go to tryst in the wynn and meet up with these weirdo douche bags that had a table there. one guy had an amex black card and spoke of his many trips to the south of france... he was greasy and short. we get charged $15 a shot. time to go!!! we go back to the hard rock and party at body english for free.. much better! then we head over to mr. lucky's for a late night meal. mr. lucky's is the cafe in the hard rock. it's the bomb.

day 2- we wake up and head down to the hard rock pool. rehab is going on this weekend (the biggest pool party of the year) so it's crowded!!! the pool is so dirty you can't see your feet in one foot deep water, people are sloppy drunk and fucktrotting in the pool. it's only 11 am saturday morning. i meet a guy names big b. big b has a cabana and says me and my 5 girlfriends can drink in his cabana. SCORE! free drinks all day saturday!!! we eat at the pink taco. pink taco is hella good! we are hammered by 5 and go to mr. lucky's for dinner. we meet a promoter who promises us VIP in Body English that night. Wo0t to more free shit! We go up to the room to get ready and end up falling asleep. we wake up at 12:30 and decide to go out. we make it to Mr. Lucky's and a quick spin around the casino. we are hit on by forigners and ghetto people. back to the room.

day 3- REHAB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAAAAA!!!! we go out to the pool. it's more insane than the day before. we meet ""married guy"" who is from new york and spend the day hanging out with him and drinking out of his cabana. he's cool and will fill his drink and then pour half of it one of our drinks so we don't have to leave to pool area. we pose for the billions of cameras there and we spot ernie.... ernie was just floating in the pool all by himself. nikki boobie and i rescue him and carry him around for the rest of the day. that giant inflatable penis got us a lot of free drinks, so we decide to take him home with us. after a long day at the pool we make our way to the japanese restaurant that i can't think of the name of at the moment. 

day 4- we hit up mr. lucky's one last time and get packed to head back to cali. mr. lucky's has the best omlets ever. omg, best ever after a weekend of hardcore drinking. 

moral of the story... 6 bitches go to vegas for 4 days for a bachelorette party and only wander out of the hard rock for about a 6 hour period. we drink for free for 3 days straight inside the hotel. this hotel is the shit!!!! between the room, the pool, mr. lucky's, pink taco, body english the casino, the bar and the japanese place... we were more than entertained. all these great places located in one hotel... that's why i give the hard rock 5 stars.",4,7,1

Computer systems were down and registration was a nightmare with no upgrades or apologies.  We sat around for 6 hours.  No one bothered to text us when they were ready to assign a room.
TV did not work and the lighting is very dim.  
Disney-world Florida style tacky crowd of nearly underage people.  Mostly young, drunk, and dumb. Not anyone I would care to associate with in real life.  Overweight girls squished into tacky tight dresses or ripped up shorts and tank tops.  Tatooed guys and low-wage workers.
This is not the wealthy crowd for sure, but you get what you pay for.
Rehab on the weekends takes over the hotel with thumping loud music and disgusting people.  These girls need to look in the mirror before they pull on that teenie bathing suit.  I rode on the elevator with 6 barely legal girls discussing why women have a higher sex drive than men. Huh?

Check In: I stayed in the ""HRH Tower"" which is an all suite tower and has their OWN check in desk which is immediately inside from the parking garage (Harmon side). You get to avoid lugging your stuff all the way through the casino If you are in this tower. Score! Front Desk staff seemed rather robotic and disinterested.

Room: The room (HRH Suite) had a very different layout from most, but it was sparkling CLEAN 
and had panoramic views and ALOT of window real estate. The bathroom was behind a glass door in the middle of the suite. The shower was absolutely huge which i loved. I cannot mention enough the goose down bedding......i slept like a rock (ironic eh?).

Mr Lucky Restaurant: 24\/7 cafe, the prices were a tad steep, but not as bad as alot of OTHER cafes i have been to and the food and decor were decent.

Center Bar: They recently revamped and reinvented their center bar, it was lively to say the least and the bartenders were very personable and attentive.

Reliquary Spa: Well it $27 to use the facilities, even 1 hr before closing. It was a little on the smallish side but still had every amenity like the big guys on the strip. There is also a unisex common area with a HUGE pool size hot tub so both men and women can relax as well.

We arrived at the hotel about 1pm and tried to Check in. The hotel looks amazing...you walk in there BOOM there is the Casino,  all the famous articles on display, and a bar right away! So we check in and firstly there was a hidden resort fee that we didn't knowabout because we paid in full online. Didn't like that... one bit. Well then we couldn't get in our rooms because they weren't ready...and check in is usually between 3pm-5pm. So we walked around and ate and looked and shopped for almost 3 hours and they told us they would call or text when a room is available. After seeing multiple people walk away with room keys We had to go back and ask two different people was a room ready before the second said ""Oh yeah, we have a couple ready!"" Still no text to let us know...

When we finally got to the room...it was soooooo nice! The bathroom and living room area we were perfect. The room had sufficient space for 3 adults to move around and not be on top of each other. We did have to request our room to be cleaned at 4:30pm the next day...wow! No wonder the rooms are never ready..lol. We wanted to go to the strip...and they offer free shuttle service ""to the strip"" BUT it takes you to the mall! JUST the mall  

Lastly but not least...they have expired candies in a high priced gift shop. I don't think I want an expired $3 Milky Way no thanks! When we checked in we told them we would have a package coming to the hotel the next day...they said cool and it would be at ""Keys and Mail""  went to keys and Mail and it was at the business center. Go figure! Why would mail not be in a place that said ""Mail"" that was too much like right. But I got to the business center and there was another SURPRISE hidden fee of $5 to receive my package! What?! So if I didn't have $5 you were gonna keep my stuff? Smh Also there was a music screen in our hotel room where you could turn up and hook your phone up and what not.....there was an aux port to hook up your phone but NO aux cord!! Whyyyyyy would you have one without the other?! Smh I wont be back Hard rock!",1,0,0

1.  The pool.  By the end of the day, it is DISGUSTING.  Our room overlooked it and when we came stumbling in during the AM hours, we got to see the difference between how it looks pre-cleaning and how it looks post-cleaning.  Cloudy, green and with an oily film on top, it is just unacceptable.  The worst part is, I don't see how it can be avoided considering how many people the pool hosts everyday.. C'est la vie.

2.  The casino area pales in comparison to other hotels.  It's just not very big.

3.  Rooms overlooking the pool.  GREAT view, especially for the gentlemen, but that fucking club music starts WAY too early and vibrates the walls and floors.  I swear to God I must've gained 5lbs of muscle in my arms just from fist-pumping in my sleep.

OK, fuck that negative nonsense, on to the positives:

1.  The rooms.  Spacious, clean, well laid out.

2.  The WOMEN.  Holy balls, spectacular.  

3.  Mr. Luckies 24\/7 Restaraunt.  Good, cheap food.  Ask for the 777 deal which is not on the menu,  Decent sized steak, grilled shrimp, potatos, and a salad for $7.77.  

4. Pole dancers from 8PM-2AM in the casino.  Hot chicks wearing barely nothing, dancing on a pole.  A win in any mans book.

5.  Employees.  Very friendly and helpful.  Kelsey, one of the managers, and Amanda, one of the girls behind the desk, specifically.  Great job, ladies.  Oh and, Amanda? GORGEOUS. 

6.  Location. Easy enough to get anywhere you need to go.

Over the years, I've stayed at most of the major properties in Las Vegas and over the past 5 or 6 stays have settled here. 

I can't give them 5 stars, cause it's not a Wynn\/Encore type joint... but a solid 4 they deserve.  I've stayed in each of the towers.  HRH is perfectly upscale and quiet enough get a good night's sleep before a meeting.  The Paradise Tower is also nice, but a bit far away from the action.  The main tower has been redone and now has many of the same features as the newer towers, plus the famous french-doors that open for fresh air.

The hotel staff has always been friendly and helpful to me... you get  back what you put out you know.  Mr. Lucky's food is exactly what I like... standard diner type fare that's always hot and fresh. Pink Taco is great too.  

Just watched the NBA title game last week at one of the bars in the new section.  It was a great time.  All in all, I think you'll be hard pressed to beat the value the Hard Rock offers.",0,0,0

Overall, our experience was VERY nice. There on business but stayed a little extra, we enjoyed most amenities at the HR. We arrived on a Sunday, a family with young children, I was not sure if I made the correct choice of staying here. The place was VERY loud and young. People were out of it, drunk and possibly more as we did see someone getting kicked out for selling drugs (one of about seven we saw on our stay). The staff was very nice and place overall was clean. Though the family pool was littered with cigarettes floating and beer bottles. The room was very nice, we did upgrade. The view was amazing. Gambling I was told they are not known for and rarely saw more then a few people around actually spending. I did gamble but didn't win anything. All in fun. The restaurants, especially lucky's was great. Fuel for Americano a must! The art and music memorabilia is to die for. Some really amazing pieces. Had I been younger and single, this would be heaven. With a family, not so much. With kids, even less. 

The main reason for my possible issue, the last night we were there, 2am, sleeping in our room. My daughter wakes me saying she is scared. We all woke up from the very loud hallway party happening. The kids outside the room were very obviously drunk and hanging out. There were many and after an hour of saying to my family let them party, we were once young, it became this is unreal and has to stop. I called the front desk, no answer. Called the bell, no answer. I waited another hour and called the emergency line as I was willing to do anything to sleep. No answer..... I then heard someone yelling in the hallway to break it up and everyone left. Not sure if it was security or not. But that was really bad and had this been a real situation, that emergency line not picking up showed us a lot. Because of that, I would NOT stay here again and it did put a little damper on our stay.",2,0,0

I booked my flight and hotel well in advance - in November, 2013. I booked through Expedia and paid in full for both my flights and my hotel room. I received a confirmation from the Hard Rock within minutes, saying that my booking had been accepted and my credit card payment had been processed. There was nothing left to do except continue to plan our event and get excited! 

However, things took a turn on May 3, 2014, when I received an e-mail from Expedia informing me that there 'may be' an 'urgent problem' with my room at the Hard Rock due to 'sudden, unforeseen circumstances.' Expedia asked me to contact a 1-800 number to deal with the problem. 

 I contacted this number immediately and was told that the hotel had 'overbooked' and that my room was no longer available. I tried to explain that I had already paid in full, over six months ago, for my room, and received a confirmation from the hotel, so I did not understand how this was happening at this time - not even two weeks before my scheduled departure date. I also tried to explain that I was going down with a group of people, who were all staying at the Hard Rock, for a special occasion. I did not want to move hotels. 

The woman at Expedia's Lodging Support Services was very cold. She simply told me that it was ""...too bad..."" and there was nothing she could do. She told me that I would have to ""...come to terms with the fact that I must relocate..."" and that I could not stay with my group at the Hard Rock. She told me that I should be happy that she was offering (what she deemed to be) comparable lodging at the 'South Point Inn', which is a small hotel WAY off the strip and in the desert. It goes for about $50.00 a night. Keep in mind that I had already paid more than double that - per night - for my room at the Hard Rock. I was obviously extremely upset. I ended up speaking to three different people at Expedia, who all told me the same thing. But I refused to give up.

At that point, I decided to contact the Hard Rock directly. I was able to speak to the manager of reservations. He told me that there had been some kind of a mistake at the hotel and that it had accidently overbooked itself only a few days ago. I told him that I had already paid for my room, more than six months ago - in full!!!!!!! - and that I did not want to move hotels. Again, I got no answers and no apologies. The hotel seemed to be treating this like ""...no big deal."" I was told that a ""....hotel is a hotel..."" and I should just take whatever I had been given. No one seemed to care that I was travelling for a special occasion and that I had planned to stay in that hotel for that purpose and did not care to be separated from my group. I was just told ""...to deal with it..."" and I was brushed off. 

I am leaving for Vegas on May 16, 2014 - four days from now. I have still not received any further confirmation from the hotel. No one has contacted me and no one seems to care about me or my group or my event. I have never been treated so poorly by a hotel - or any business for that matter - before. I am absolutely shocked by what has happened and it has ruined the entire trip already - not just for me but also for my group. We feel like complete garbage. I just want what I rightfully paid for. But that seems like too much to ask for when it comes to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.

The biggest draw back to this hotel is it is not directly on the strip and the shuttle stops at five.  This was certainly a disappointment. And you want to have a nap in the afternoon when they are having one of the pool parties, it was very difficult to do so.

That being said, I actually really loved that hotel.  It was right up our alley, very cool and rock and roll. The photography was stunning and the music taste was top shelf, as one would expect.  It was full but never so crowded that we couldn't move about the casino.  Our room was beautiful. The bed was absolutely heaven, it is a wonder I'm not still there rolling around in it.  We didn't have much of a view, but we prepaid on a discount website, so that is to be expected.

When I booked the room, it came with coupons.  Such as a free daybed, free drinks at Vinyl, some coupon deal for Mr. Lucky's during a certain time period, etc.
The daybed had a catch to it.  You get a free daybed but you have to spend $100 on food and drinks.  I ended up not going down to the pool because I was enjoying the bed and A\/C so much!  I didn't realize Rehab was at this hotel until I saw posters.  I did enjoy the music that was played nonstop throughout the day.

The room was really nice, and the beds were fancy looking.  But the walls are kind of thin.  We could always hear our neighbors walking into their room and they were sometime singing\/karaoke'ing too.  One night we had a neighbor smoking weed in his\/her room, and the smell was seeping through the crack of the door into our room;  I guess that would be a good thing for some people who like to second-hand smoke it for free!

Every time my friend and I went out at night and came back to the hotel, she ordered room service.  Such a waste of money.  She ordered a full pizza and chicken wings.  The order came out to around 40 something dollars.  They make you pay a $3 service\/delivery fee and 18% gratuity etc.  And if you touch any of the drinks\/food in the room\/fridge on the sensors, you will be charged a lot.

The women who clean the rooms were very nice and friendly.  Every time we asked for more towels, tp, toiletries, we were given ample.  And if you book a room here, you get free wi-fi with good connection.

So our trip was supposed to go from Tuesday til Friday, and so we extended our checkout to buy us time.  In the end, we just booked another night because we got so hammered the night prior.  We slept all day and night.  The beds were so soft and comfortable.",2,1,0

I'm sure that when the place first opened, it was the ""happening"" place to go.  Now, it seems more like the place where wanna-be's dress up for their Vegas experience.  Throughout my stay the word ""skanky"" seemed to come to mind quite a bit.  

Most of the decor is dated.  The coolest part of the place is certainly the music memorabilia, but I think the hotel hopes that if you see all of the showcases, you'll miss how cheap and dated the rest of the interior looks.

Then there's the suite.  For a suite in the HRH tower, you would think that it would be pretty cool.  Instead I was treated to ottomans with suspicious stains on them.  Once I saw those, I avoided sitting on any other furniture then the bed.  There was a large bathtub in the suite, with small curly hairs on the interior.  I had to sweep the bathroom floor with a towel, as I could see where small shards of glass were.

At 5:45 am I got a call from the front desk, telling me that there was a problem with my credit card.  Who wakes up a guest at 5:45 am.  The guy knew my name and room number.  I suspected a scam so called the front desk myself.  They said there was no problem.  Since I hadn't bought anything, even drinks, at the hotel, I suspect that someone inside the hotel must have given my information to someone to try and scam me out of my credit card info.

Upon check-in, we were upgraded to one of the rooms in the casino tower without knowing!  I remember we got there and we were in awe...was this really what we booked?! I absolutely was in LOVE with it!  I loved how we had a view of the pool, which, was disturbing during the weekends when all you want to do is sleep.  The music carries up into the rooms and sometimes, in the early AM, they do sound checks for their speakers...which sucks.  But, on the flip side, it was the most awesome way to wake up on the weekends, especially if Rehab is happening downstairs!  While I am sad I did not have the time to attend Rehab, I loved being able to rock out in the comfort of my own room to the DJs that were playing (and for the weekend I was there, I was excited that it was two DJs that knew how to get the party started!)

Anyway back to the rooms.  The beds were super comfy!  They were better than the bed I have back home here lol...and even right now, as I type this and remember the awesomeness of my room, I get a little ""homesick"".  The room was decently sized, it was large enough that when we had a few guests over everyone did not seem like they were cramped.  

I am sad that during the course of my stay, that I did not have the time to visit all of the Hard Rock's many restaurants.  The next time I come back, I will defiantly make reservations to try out Ago or Nobu.  Happy hour at the Pink Taco was awesome and I recommend checking it out!

My friends and I walked through all of the hotels and they are all beautiful. All other hotels smell of regret but the hard rock smells of regret, desperation, and smoke! They haven't put a proper ventilation system in yet. I've stayed at 4 different hotels in Vegas and this is the first one to hide it's resort fees until you checkout. Wouldn't it be nice to know what your paying?? Don't even touch the mini bar items. They will charge you $9.25 for triggering the sensor of the snickers bar.

When we first arrived there was absolutely nobody waiting in line to check in. It was dead. A desk clerk and her colleague were busy making ""jazz hands"" and ""spirit fingers"" that they did not even acknowledge us. I had to ask her if she was available. Already a bad start. 
I didn't realize that my account with the third party had my maiden name and credit card with maiden name linked to it. Maritza, the jazz-handing desk clerk rolled her eyes and asked if I had any other ID to prove that was me. I showed her every single card in my wallet but she wanted my passport...like I mentioned earlier we are local so I don't carry my passport around with me while I'm in my hometown. I asked her if she could ask a supervisor and she walked away to do so. When she came back, rather than empathize with us she told us we would have to make a cash deposit, which we didn't mind doing but she made it seem like it was such a hassle to her. She went on to make some random phone call talking quietly but I heard her say my last name. She handed us our keys and we went to our room.
When we arrived at our room it had 2 double beds instead of the 1 king that was booked. In the booking options we were given multiple different choices and I specifically picked King, non smoking. I called front desk from the phone multiple times with no answer. Finally I called a different department and asked to be transferred. That worked, wonder why? (Sarcasm).
The supervisor David or Davis (can't remember) took my call, I explained how our experience had been horrific from the beginning and now to add insult to injury we got the wrong room. He apologized for me ""not reading the fine print"" where it states HRH does not guarantee any room type or smoking option! How's that for customer service? He said there were no other rooms with a king bed available for the night. Which I found hard to believe considering the hotel was barren. 
I went on several different booking websites which all showed king bed option still available that night. Which means either I was lied to or there would\/could be a lot of angry guests expecting a king bed and not getting it.

I guess we were in the main section of the hotel, on the 11th floor facing the pool. We headed out pretty much immediately. Came back to the hotel around 9 and our room was extremely hot. We thought we just had the air on the wrong setting, so we fixed it and headed out again. Got back at 4 am and our hotel room was around 80 degrees, so we called maintenance. They responded right away, checked out our unit, and said the air was working properly. At 6 am, all four of us woke up, miserable. We went to the front desk to change rooms but were told every room was full. Our only option was to switch to an upgraded room the next day in the HRH tower, but we would have to pay for the upgrade. They refunded the day fee ($24) and we switched rooms the next day at 11. The new room was improved but I still find it unacceptable that we had to pay a $80\/day upgrade when their room was the one with the issues. If they didn't have an equal room with a working air conditioner, we should have been upgraded free of charge. While we were able to salvage the trip, I will never stay here again!",0,0,0

We got a voucher for the cabana bed at the pool which is awesome since the pool there is pretty famous with rehab and all. I had a good time watching the most ridiculously drunk people try to hit on each other. One guy literally fell flat on his face then got up and tried to talk to me. I wanted to tell him he was a liability at that stage but I thought that word might have to many syllables in it so I just moved slightly to the side.

The drinks were pricey poolside but the huge margaritas were delicious, although I felt like I wasn't getting drunk.

Our room was nice albeit there was no view but for what we paid, it was to be expected. The diner there had some tasty deep fried business although they got the order wrong but c'est la vie.

It's always complicated to get my rooms reserved and prepaid for, but this year...  well this year was just a nightmare.
  
So instead of telling you about who dropped the ball, I'd first like to tell you who helped pick it back up and that would be Norma in reservations and Todd the front desk manager.  These two individuals were absolutely stellar in helping me.  The issues seemed to stem from somewhere beyond Norma and Todd, though that part is still a mystery.  

Ok, now back to the story - way back in August of 2016, I was advised to deal with Michael Rowland, Executive Director of Group Sales.  This was the first year (out of 9 that I've handled this show) that a Hard Rock director was involved which I thought was weird, but I did as I was told.  Michael simply doesn't respond.  Send him emails or leave him voicemails, doesn't matter because he's not going to respond.  I kept getting pressure on my end to get the talent room rates so we could make our contract negotiations and Michael simply would not answer any of my communications.  Days later he finally emailed me this 8 page long contract that was so confusing that I couldn't make heads or tails of it, and then of course he refused to respond to my questions. The only thing he would talk about was some sort of credit card compliance issues that they were having...  He left me a voicemail about it.  I'm sorry, but how is that in any way my issue?  Beyond it not being my issue, I wasn't even trying to prepay for any rooms at that point, I was simply trying to obtain pricing.  I never was able to get anything useful out of Michael, so I ultimately had to give up on him all together.  When the time came for reserving the rooms I didn't even bother trying to deal with Michael again, I just reserved the rooms myself.  I guess this is a shady way of not having to discount any rooms at all for any reason?  That's certainly what it seemed like from my perspective.  For him to hold an ""Executive"" title of anything is staggering to me.

After the third night in a row of being called by my employees having problems at the hotel I was ready to cry.  I mean, who needs this level of stress?  Las Vegas is supposed to be a fun place to do business in, but none of my employees had any fun.  It seemed that none of my payments were actually applied (despite me calling and verifying every single room and writing down who I spoke to, the date and the time) it just did not matter.  Nothing was enough; it seemed that all of the hotel accounting had simply ground to a halt on the back end. 
 
This entire event was maddening to me because it erodes the faith my employees have in me being able to make their travel flow smoothly.  One of my senior level people had a hotel staff person knock on his door and ask him to leave because of the payment issues... His room was fully prepaid before he ever even got to Las Vegas!!  This makes me look like I can't do my job!  So thanks Hard Rock Hotel, thanks for causing me to have to apologize to a room full of annoyed people, thanks for multiple late night phone calls from my employees, thanks for making huge accounting messes for me to try to figure out and thanks for dropping the ball in every possible way.

My husband and I just had a long weekend getaway to Las Vegas and we decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel because it looked pretty updated and trendy online and the price seemed decent. While I did really enjoy the room decor and super-comfy bed, my experience over all wasn't so great. 

The hotel lobby and casino was one of the smokiest of all the hotels we visited while in Las Vegas. Once you walked far enough past the casino for the cigarette smoke to dissipate, we were hit with the constant smell of what reminded me of someone scorching leftovers in a toaster oven. The smell was present our entire stay and even visited us on all the way on the 7th floor.

Although I enjoyed melting into the down-filled bed, the room was far too dark to even dig through my suitcase. The walk-in shower was big enough for a party, but they were stingy with the towels.

We ordered room service for breakfast one morning. It was mediocre at best, but it set us back $70 for some chewy pancakes and coffee.

Another issue--although a completely personal one that I will nonetheless share with you--is that I didn't feel cool enough to stay at this hotel. Everyone walking around, young and old alike, was wearing head-to-toe black or at least a black band shirt with ripped up jeans. I'm all for however you wanna dress, I just felt like a total ""never-been-in-a-band"" outsider.

The hotel staff was nice enough, but they definitely weren't going to bend over backwards to help anyone--that may have broken their bad*** character (all decked out in their matching Mötley Crüe shirts I might add). **This is in comparison to being turned around in one of the bigger hotels on the strip where a nice gentleman took the initiative to ask us what we were looking for and gave us directions to our lunch destination.

I think that since the Hard Rock Hotel isn't directly on the strip, it needs to work even harder to take care of its' guests. (Also, seriously--drop the $20 per day fee to use the fitness facilities).",2,1,2

Our room looked out over the ""rehab"" pool and onto the strip. The room was also ""oversize"" with a huge flat screen, modern furnishings, and french-doors.

We get there, door is screwed up, call help desk ""we'll send someone up""  I know that tone, it's a ""we're not going to send anyone up, Im feeling lazy and I hate my job"".

Then for my job, I need to have a direct cat5 connection can't use wifi for security reasons, cat5 doesn't work, they don't have an IT department, instead they use a cable provider who knows nothing about the equipment, finally after a 2nd call to desk about the stuck door, this time we get someone to come up.

Plusses, the slots are loose.

The museum that is spread around the hotel is great, and the pool is perfect, it looks dirty because of the reflection, I took a brief swim...don't, it smells like armpits, just keep your head above water.  

Ok correction, pool AREA is perfect, you can lay back in their very comfortable chairs and snooze and take an occasional dip or hang in the over 21 place and scream stupid things like ""I am soooo drunk, omg omg, I'm an animal yes, hear me scream arrrrgh arrrrrgh!""  Meanwhile those of us who can handle a drink, with a more mature mind that comes with age will be elsewhere.  

Last sting and final fu to me was the last day where before we checked out, went down to the store by the elevators and picked up 1 package of little donuts (they're sold everywhere), and one package of coffee cake, and a soda.  It came out to $9.50  She charged $3.50 for the drink of which I can get upstairs for $2.50.

I was then supposed to sit in the lobby with my wife and wait.  Not the way to start a trip.  There should be no reason why all the reservations can't be ready by the 4pm check in time.

Our room was very nice with one feature that was really cool.  Music piped into the room with a pretty cool selection.  Dimmers were not available on any of the lights.  They are either on full blast or off.  Not a good design.  Also no free Internet which I think in a suite this should be standard.

It was so disturbingly loud in the room we thought, ""this can not be happening.""  I called the front desk and was told the music would stop by 4am.  WHAT!!!.  I was also told they could not move me as they were at capacity.  By 3am I was so over the noise I would have paid a premium to be anywhere else.

I called the desk again at 3am.  The woman told me they would move us first thing in the morning and she was sorry,  and to come down early to get it handled.  Now its Sunday morning and Rehab pool is about to  begin its music soon (we had a pool view room), so I got up early and tried to have the situation fixed.  I asked for a manager at 9am.  The woman told me she could help (not wanting to get a manager) and would see what she might be able to do.  She apologized and said she could move us but not until 11 or 12!!  I was not happy.  She then offers $50 dollars off for ""breakfast"".  This is insulting but I take the $50 and say Ill be back by 12 noon.  

We go to lunch.  Hang out wait half the day and come back to the HRH Tower at 3pm.  I ask for the keys for our new room.  A new front desk employee (with a horrible attitude) tells me the room is still not ""inspected"" and it will be another 30 to 40 minutes, I've heard that before.  Now I am ballistic.  I ask for a manager right away.  The GM will not come out right away.  He's busy and she says ""he will be out in about 20 minutes.""

In the mean time the original girl comes walking back from her break (the one I spoke to at 9am). I explain to her what is happening and she goes behind the counter, looks in the computer and says ""your room is ready.""  We move and a GM never comes out to talk to me face to face.  I'm""m told he or she will call me.  I get to he new room and the GM has left a message on my new room phone.  A great way not to have to talk to me.  I call her back and am told she is busy but will call in a few minutes.  She never calls.  

The next morning I ask about talking to someone, like the GM who called me last night and left a message.  I'm told she is now on military leave and is not available.

Long story short we fly home and at 11pm Monday night I get someone on the line and tell them my story.  He gives me $150 off and sends the confirmation in an email that say's ""do not respond to this email.""  I promise I wont respond ever.

Morgan's Hotel group you now have the two worst hotel experiences I have ever had HRH Tower in Vegas and the Hudson Hotel in NYC.

At least with the resort fee you are provided ample parking and WiFi access for your wireless devices. The front desk and room service employees were very friendly. I paid $45 for a tower suite with a strip view on a Friday night! The suite was very modern looking and offered more cable channel selections (including HBO) than most Vegas hotels I have stayed in.

Always wanted to visit this casino because of its appearances on these shows. I came to Vegas for four days, and stayed at Mandalay Bay, but almost stayed at the Hard Rock due to the lower prices. 

Upon visiting the Hard Rock to gamble (blackjack), I noticed that the casino was not as busy as other Casinos (I know, it's not on the strip). But I thought it had a pretty sweet design. As far as blackjack tables, they did not have any under $15.00 per hand. However, I was able to sit at a table with one other person for approximately two hours, and was able to walk away with an extra few hundred dollars. Also, the blackjack is played from a shoe, and not from a continuous shuffler. Great bar service, and enjoyed man free drinks (don't forget to tip!)

One thing my family said, is that there was a lack of stores for them to shop at, and varity of areas to walk around while I gambled. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this casino and am glad I went. Would not mind staying here in a future vegas vacation.",0,0,0

Hard Rock is not the nicest, or the best, or even one of the best, hotels in Vegas.  But if you are looking for a good hotel with a great price that does the job - Hard Rock is it.   We booked through Expedia and our trip included our flight.  It was a good deal.  My friends booked through a Groupon and stayed in the HRC tower, which is nicer, but I think we got the better deal.  In the Casino tower, which is older, our room was awesome, the bathroom was nice, the bed was super comfy and the view totally sucked.  It was a full view of a roof area with a wall.  We only saw a sliver of sky.  But....because our view sucked, we were able to take a nap on the Saturday we were there and our room was nice and quiet!   (Naps are necessary in Vegas.)  And who spends tons of time staring out their window in Vegas anyway?  Our friends, with their fancy suites in the HRC tower, with views overlooking the great ""Rehab"" pool party...their rooms were super loud.  Like, major bass and really obnoxious.

We went to Vegas to celebrate our friend's 40th birthday.  We had a great time, we were there for less than 48 hours.  Hard Rock totally suited our needs.  We ate at Pink Taco for Sunday brunch and were very happy, and the other restaurant there was great as well.  The bars and drinks were ok, and the gambling was pretty average.  I'm taking off a star because checking in (on a Friday afternoon) was kind of a mess.  Long lines, not enough desk agents, and our room wasn't ready by 5pm, which was really crappy!  Check in is between 3-5.  Give people their rooms on time!  When we complained about it, we got a 'I'm really sorry' and that was it.  So...we just got screwed out of some time and no one really cared.  But other than that, pretty awesome trip!  (I wish I could give a 3.5 score, but I'll round up)

(If you really like gambling - stay somewhere else.  Other casinos we visited were way more happening and fun, with more options.  HR is old and off the strip, so the casino wasn't a draw for us.  And if you like a major club-scene pool party - Rehab is it.  It's both weekend days and from the looks of it, people were ready to PARTY at the pool.  We are not into that scene, so we stayed at the quieter, free pool, and had a lovely time.  Although, unless you pay for a cabana, lounge chairs are hard to come by.  If I could do it again, I would just splurge on that.)",1,1,1

Jump in the 90 degree water of these pools and get out into 110 degrees,,,,you're going to be irritable. With all the money they make, they can't have one pool that is cooled down?

We stayed in the HRH Tower and had a corner suite, which had spectacular views of the strip. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room itself was huge with the bathroom being the focal point. There was no mini-fridge in the room which was a bummer as we wanted to have a drink or two in the room. Missed revenue for them. The shampoo and conditioner left a lot to be desired.

Service:
Loved being able to check out from our room and avoid lines at the registration desk. All the staff there are really nice and want to go the extra mile in my experience. We were very pleased with their level of service.

Food:
We ate at NOBU the sushi restaurant and it was really fresh sushi. A little pricey but not bad for what you get. Pink Taco was just OK and left a lot to be desired. We did like the sangria and champagne drink they have on the menu. Every morning we ate at Mr. Lucky's which had a great breakfast menu and would recommend eating there.

This is a great spot to stay for the younger crowd or the young at heart. It does get pretty wild but we expected this during our stay and it was a lot of fun to people watch.

I did really appreciate all of the music themes and memorabilia. There are tons of outfits, guitars and other items from many different celebrities that have made a mark on Hard Rock and it was cool. 

When we checked in, they did not have the room we requested available, so we were forced to choose between a smoking room or a suite with an upgrade fee. We picked the upgrade, and the front desk lady said she would take off a day's convenience fee, how nice! But it was not taken off at the final billing. I called later and they said they would refund me, but they still haven't. 

The pool is cool, but only one of them is accessible for free as a guest, which is weird.

Easily can walk by your destination because the circle is so small and if you get busy talking, you'll have to back track, or just keep walking the circle! I like the Casino and lobby, didn't really like the joint, and body english is decent. 

The bar is fun, cute intimate bar, a circle of course, plenty of flirty guys. Not this weekend but at another time I sat at an empty table and it  filled up fast once i sat down, so don't be afraid of an empty table! 

The food places are a grill, (forgot the name) nobu, and AGO. I skipped nobu, but ate food at both other places. And both are good. One of the chefs at the grill sent over some sundaes, with a wink. very sweet! I lost my phone at AGO, and the cutey bartender got a flashlight, and on his hands and knees found it for me!

Hard Rock has the friendliest, funniest and most accomodating employees. Everyone from the bodyguards to the taxi fetchers are funny and flirty.

Truly...everything I have listed about the cleanliness of the room, etc. I was fine ignoring because EDC had just passed and I figured everyone was slammed with crazy guests and a lot of mess.

But what I like most is that the few times I have stayed here now, I have booked last minute through HotelTonight app on my iPhone for just over 100 dollars. And both times I had an awesome room - 1 in the south tower that was a suite and one that was in the Casino tower overlooking the very cold and uninhabited rehab pool (it IS winter you know). 

The bar down in the middle of all the poker tables has this special architectural feature to it that when you are sitting there.... you hear everyone else's conversations as if they were participating in your own... so mind you, watch what you say if you are actually gossiping about someone across the bar; or don't if you actually want the hot chic across the way to know that you think shes slammin :-)

I have had some good times at Vanity and Body English; I have seen Tiesto from the tables at the Joint and I heave enjoyed every evening I have ever experienced in the whole that is Hard Rock Hotel. Budget friendly if you are on your P's and Q's (HotelTonight & Hotels.com)",2,1,0

We arrived early, and was greeted by Mariah, at pre check in - super friendly and sweet I really liked her. She offered a room upgrade for $30\/night extra, and so we said why not. Unfortunately bc we were early we were not able to be given a room until later on that day around 2-3pm, we were contacted that our room was ready.
We were given a room in the corner of the Paradise Tower which gave us a beautiful view of the strip (especially at night). I really love the style of the room, dark and very rockish like, which is my bf and our style anyways so we enjoyed it - seemed like a lot of guests didn't. Loved the king size bed, and the walk in shower, and big bathroom counters. Make up mirror was broken - didn't stay up on its own. Also just know that there are planes that fly directly over the hotel (didn't bother us, but see how it could bother other people). A lot of the furniture was run down, and broken. 
A lot of people had said they had issues bringing their own food\/drinks into the room however, we didn't have any issues like that. Quite the opposite, we handed the bell hop our bags and a large paper bag filled with food and drinks and they could have cared less. 
Another note is that it's off the strip. This wasn't an issue for us bc we don't drink & have a car but it seems it would be a pain if u were drinking and didn't want to pay for a taxi.

I was there for a great friend's birthday sojourn extravaganza (his choice, not ours) and, surprisingly, had a blast.

My room was amazing - 9th floor, view of the pools and mountains, super clean, quiet, not a cigarette scent about. I love this hotel because they have really cool tour posters, random outfits (Stevie Nicks' black lace bodysuit from the 70's...whhhaaatt?!!!), great guitars (ZZ Top = yeah!)...yes, it's just how you remember the Hard Rock Cafes from the 90's (the ones that you may have ventured into as a kid) but in addition to the burger and fries you get the big fluffy pillows and a super comfy bed to rest your Vegas weary bones upon after an evening of Vegas overload (mortifying buffets, weird cab drivers, pricey drinks, the Fremont Street Experience, white Reeboks). 

If you don't like Vegas and you must visit, you should definitely stay here. It's a quiet from the storm that will make your stay less depressing and traumatic (plus you'll see great rock photos and memorabilia along the way). I also recommend you head out to Red Rock Canyon for hiking, Cold Creek to learn how to truly live off the grid and Lake Mead for a little lake tube floating. Good times.",1,1,2

The reservation process easy-peasy and I thought I got a steal with only paying $240 for two nights (Thursday\/Friday; Feb 7-9). When I arrived to check in the front desk staff was rude and the attendant reprimanded me for not having my Groupon printed out. I showed her the purchased Groupon on my phone and it CLEARLY stated 'No Voucher Necessary'.

Once we were finally checked in, we went to our room on the 11th floor in the Casino Tower. Although we requested a non-smoking room, we opened the door and our senses were bombarded with the fumes of paint with hints of smoke. Apparently they had been working on repairs in the rooms, because the smell of paint was evident throughout the entire floor. Upon further appraisal of the room the décor was fitting for the room, but the cleanliness was appalling and down right disgusting!! The bathroom was filthy, there was still remnants in the shower from the last guest and the sink and countertops still had heavy soap residue all over it. The toilet looked dirty, especially the back of the toilet (gross) and there were some questionable stains on the walls. I walked into the room and the beds looked clean, but there was stains on the night tables and vanity (clearly not wiped down at all). The floors looked like they hadn't seen a vacuum in a while! I called down to the ""friendly"" front desk staff asked for another room and I was told the hotel was booked due to an event and nothing else was available...that`s it! No apology, no offering to call housekeeping, nothing! I walked out of the room and tracked down a housekeeping attendant and asked her to freshen up the room. She was very annoyed, but got down to business.

Pros:
Décor is fitting for the hotel concept
Decent variety of eateries

Cons:
Resort fee..REALLY!?!?! Why isn't this included in the room costs??? This fee is unnecessary and the ""perks"" for paying it is NOT worth it!
Rude\/lackluster customer service from the point of contact personnel (front desk staff)
Run down..at least in the Casino Towers, and a bit unsanitary (based on the room they were going to allow me to stay in)

1- We booked through hoteltonight and the reception guy spent 30 minutes relentlessly trying to up sell us to another room, add strange fees to inflate the room cost - including the ""extra bed"" fee.  The clerk kept saying ""Third Party"" with a tone of ""you are scum"" - like he could barely utter the words.  My tip to the hotel, when hotels are EMPTY, is if they are going to enroll in hoteltonight, don't crap on people when they actually use it.  

2- The resort fee is total nonsense year round - but especially so in the winter when you can't actually use any of the resort features.  Most hotels have free wifi, gyms and a pool - so don't act like its a big deal - ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER.  The pool was closed.

Anyway, I would call the hotel and ask about these things before heading over.  It was nonsense to go $50 a night OVER the quoted price.

When you have a tattoo parlor and an Affliction store on site, there is no question who the HRH is marketing to. As a result, the staffs of the hotel and businesses there treats their customers like douchebags, providing curt service hoping that a pained smile would make you go away.

The hotel rooms are beautiful although the cleaners are not very thorough in cleaning the bathrooms. I spent time in all three towers. The casino tower is the oldest and smallest, the paradise tower is further away but has nicer decor, and the HRH Tower being full of suites. The penthouse suite there was incredible having a bar in the middle of the suite plus and indoor and outdoor hot spa, a library, and three bedrooms with their own bathrooms.

The prices of the rooms are reasonable since the hotel is off-strip, and the multiple businesses nearby make up for the overpriced dining options inside.

While the hotel room was wonderful, the guests next door to us were extremely rowdy and loud. We understand it is EDC and people are going to rage and party, but they were noisy as early as 4AM! We called the front desk multiple times and complained about it, only for them to tell us they would take care of it and never did. We were very upset and I contacted the manager to complain about our stay. He was apologetic and offered us 2 free nights as a condolence, as well as a dining credit. Heck yes!

So we came back June 2015 for 2 free nights and 2 paid nights. It was MUCH better. We stayed in a different Hard Rock Tower this time, and had an amazing view of the pool area and strip. The room was nice too but the only complaint being that the bathroom in the previous room was much nicer, with a walk in shower and rain fall shower head. The second room had a tub with grip bars for the elderly. Doesn't exactly scream Hard Rock vibe.

Other than that one small thing, our stay was great. HR is off the strip and about a 15 minute walk. They do offer a daily shuttle that drops you off on the far end of the strip by the shopping center. We enjoyed gambling (with free drinks when you play!), the food at Pink Taco which has amazing diablo nachos, and the pool, which is especially nice because it has sand where the lounge chairs are, just like the beach which goes into the water too.

That may be policy to not clean unless requested,not sure, but I felt that was a bit lame.  I also took advantage of their Backstage Pass, but was disappointed with the failure to provide the Dining Credit as claimed.  It was my fault for not reading the instructions clearly, but I think it is poor to have the customer go to a cashier cage and provide a pass that you then give to the restaurant of your choice.  I charged my meals to my room, why not just apply the credit at checkout time.  That would be better customer service.  The restaurants I went to, Nobu, Mr Lucky's, Pink Tacos and Pizza Forte, were all very good.  Though I think Nobu is a bit overrated, Sushi Takashi, off the Strip, is far better.

We called right away to make sure that we wouldnt get charged for it, two hours later someone finally came into our room to check on the door and didnt say much and left. We stayed three nights here, so far fridge door broke, our bathroom light didnt work 80 percent of the time (no one ever came to fix it the amount of times we asked were insane), and the light on the right side of the bed was basically falling off wall and wasnt attached.
Good thing--Check out was simple easy and fast. Valet was also friendly and eager to help always.

Its been awhile.  Look no further, the Hard Rock will fill that void! Came down to Vegas for my annual CES trip and had a Hang Over style time as always.  ;-)

You will never ever hear hip-hop or edc here.  The suite I got hooked up with was sweet! I walked up to Registration to check-in and the gal that helped me was top notch.  Knew my name before I even said anything.  Probably because I was wearing my CES badge, but hey, that's why they are getting a 5-star from me.

Everything was a pretty smooth sailing.  The suite we had was pretty stellar for this Vegas caliber hotel.  The only things that was lacking were a fridge and a coffee maker.  While those things were pretty trivial, they would have came in handy.  The suite was decked out in modern rock-n-roll fashion-edgy tiling and art throughout the spacious bathroom and living room.  This room was equipped with LCD TVs, drawers, and plenty of closet space.  The bathroom was super spacious like a fancy master bath.  Walk-in shower stall with rainfall shower head and hand shower head.  Toilet had its own door.  Dual sinks.  

Separating the bedroom and the bathroom was a glass wall with curtains, luckily, since I was sharing with another friend.  Pretty cool for the most part.  Beds were super comfortable.  Housekeeping was very friendly and courteous.  

For my entire 3 night stay, I truly felt like a ROCK STAR.  Since I did not get to gamble here, I can only speak for my sleeping experience.  The distance to the strip was a short distance, so its not bad if you want to take a quick ride via Taxi.  If I ever get a deal here again through Kayak and such, I definitely would not hesitate to book another stay.",8,6,7

While I was waiting in line to check in, my friends were waiting with our stuff and we very clearly had 2 cases of beer with us, which one of the valets helped us get inside the hotel.  Like I said, check-in took a while, so they sat there for another 20 min with this beer.  We carry it all way into our room in Casino tower, then down and over to their room in Paradise tower, only to be stopped by staff saying ""You can't bring that in here"".  At that point I said screw it, we brought it in anyway.

The room was awesome and the best was even better.  We were in the Casino Tower over looking the pool and it was beautiful.  There wasn't a fridge so we (mistakenly) pulled some items from the mini bar and put our beer in there to get cold.  Replaced everything before we left, didn't actually consume anything from the mini bar, but upon check out had been charged for everything we moved.  Probably my fault for being naive, but they could have put a sign explaining that.  The guy said anything that's moved and not put back within 15 seconds will be charged.

Everything else went pretty great until 2 days after we left.  My credit card was charged for $25 and I called asking them why, they said that I rented two movies during my stay.  First, being frustrated, I said ""Oh, because that's why I go to Vegas. To watch movies and get a lot of sleep"", but when I actually contested they took them right off.

Really expired when the promo said you had to travel by June.  We even gave them the promo code and said my boss said the best we can do is off a $25 food and beverage credit.  Hard Rock is just not the same as it was 4 years ago.  After just staying at Aria 2 months ago, then was a complete let down.  In addition apparently there is a shortage on shampoo as housekeeping failed to get us more for the first two days and had to call down to have them bring more and to top it all off housekeeping took 4 of our Rehab cups.

If you book a king bed, odds are they'll upgrade you if you complain (although they didn't offer last night).  All rooms are great.  Four of the five nights were perfect.  Last night, some idiot in the room next door started blasting music at 8 AM.  Called security who was very friendly, but they also didn't fix the problem.  Oh well, by then it was nearly nine.  Not really the hotel's fault, but like any casino hotel, sometimes the other guests are inconsiderate.

For the most part, it's just your typical Vegas hotel and casino (mixed with the Hard Rock Cafe type decor, of course). The problem is that the ""amenities"" are $28 per night extra at check in, and you definitely don't get what you pay for. Pool hours are too short, spa services are incredibly spendy, wireless is constantly dropping and so you have to repeatedly sign in, housekeeping is horrid, and room service doesn't take away their trays (my neighboring rooms' leftovers are still sitting out in the hallway after 13 plus hours). There is a shuttle to the strip (the Hard Rock is two plus miles away), but that only runs until 5pm.

Housekeeping especially needs to be touched on as my room was gross before I even checked in. The shower curtain had obvious microbead shower soap goo all over the inside, but it took speaking to three different people to get a clean one. The hair dryer and that bag that it hangs in are both spattered in crud, the carpet had clothing stickers on it from the previous tenants (center of the room, so pretty obvious), and there's a cleaning rag left in the corner. It really makes me think about what other less obvious gunk has been left behind.

Plus, I have a room with one of those adjoining doors between me and my neighbor to one side, which has no sound proofing (let's just say that I know to much about a stranger's intimacy preferences now).

There are several other things that could be improved upon, but I'm sure someone else's review has touched on them. The issues I listed here are plenty enough to leave me an unhappy customer without having to list them all.",3,2,0

The night club is your typical dull, get drunk and try to hook up with someone in Vegas nightclub. The atmosphere there though makes it more of a prime hang out area and being off the strip gives it some uniqueness to it.

We stayed in a new tower - Paradise Tower. Which, let me warn you, is about a mile long hike to get to. You go from the front desk, back towards the elevators, but go alllllll the way down the hall, past Pink Taco, around the hall, down the ramp, past the (not so) ironic Affliction store, past the steroid meat market (gym), past the Starbucks that is always ass packed... Continue walking past the doors to the pools, which includes REHAB - a huge pool party for those of you living under a rock. Mind you, there are about 12-18 doors for the damn pools, and most of them you cant use to get into the pools anyway. Useless much? And on the days that Rehab cracks, the halls are wall to wall with people trying to get in. Anyway, keep walking... walking... Walk past the deli on your right that seems to be good for sammiches, drinks, and small breakfast things. Walk around another corner and you're FINALLY there. 

As much as I like this place, as a casino and for Rehab, the rooms are smallllllllllll and DARK! The bathroom is honestly ridiculous. There is no room to stand in the separated toilet and shower area with the door open. Its almost impossible to CLOSE the door to that area when you're inside of it.

The rooms are darker (in this tower) than any hotel I've ever been in. Dark wallpaper and carpet calls for better lighting. Even with the drapes open there wasn't sufficient lighting. Maybe that was because it was gloomy out? But I really don't think so.
The only mirror you could actually SEE yourself in, was in the bathroom. The other two mirrored doors were covered in a ""smoke effect"". Weird..

Sure, the beds were hella comfy, the room service was prompt and polite, and the housekeepers didnt come knocking at 9am. But the room itself sucked. I may go back, sure if its comped again. But Id rather pay for Venetian, Caesars, or something ON the strip for a little more

I thought it was an overall really nice looking and clean hotel and casino. Not too smokey or anything like that.

*There are multiple options for cheap food and drinks inside the hotel.

*The little sports-bar restaurant there was awesome.
Good food and nice place to watch a game; there is even a mini sports book in side! We watched all the games and got really good service (even though we sat there for like 2 hours after we were done eating). Don't trip, we tipped her fatty ;)



*4 stars and not 5 only because:

1. It's kinda too dark in some places (like in the bathroom and shower)

2. It's not very close to anything.

3. Some of the dealers were really just straight up dicks.

*GO DOWN AND CHECK OUT OF YOUR ROOM IN PERSON!
I didn't like how they tried to charge me for a bottle of wine I didn't drink from my room's minibar, but they removed the charge as soon as I mentioned it, no questions asked.

*We paid $40 a night plus the $24 ""resort fee"" (in January) so overall I was extremely pleased with the value. Definitely worth looking into if you are on a budget but you still want to stay somewhere nice.

Staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas felt like one long example!  This trip was my second to Vegas, but my first (and last) stay at the Hard Rock.
A Christmas gift to my boyfriend who'd never been to Vegas, it was important to me that he get the real Vegas experience.  Since both of us are into the classic rock music thing, I figured the Hard Rock would be perfect.  I knew it wasn't on the strip, but the travel agent assured me that there was a shuttle available to guests and, since the price was right, I booked it.

Tired after a five and a half hour flight, we were eager to check in and catch some hot tub or pool time before hitting the town.  After spending the first fifteen minutes after we'd checked in  attempting to decipher the desk clerk's barely audible and rudely presented directions to get to our room, we finally flagged down a maintenance person who showed us to the elevators.  

Upon first inspection, the room seemed fine.  We called the Bell Desk and asked for our luggage to be delivered.  Here is where the tipping at the Hard Rock really began!  In most hotels in which I've stayed, the same bell man who brings your luggage into the hotel stays with you through checkin and delivers your belongings to the room.  At the Hard Rock, you are met by one person who calls the Bell Desk to ask another person to load your luggage.  When you call for the luggage from your room, a third person shows up at the door.  So, now you have been a guest in the hotel for less than thirty minutes and have already tipped three people, not counting the cab driver who brought you in from the airport because the hotel's shuttle service does not extend to airport pickup.

Now that we'd been in the room for a bit, we began to notice a few thinngs that were of concern.  The tub didn't look as if it had been cleaned since the last guest.  The light switch in the bathroom sparked when it was turned off or on.  There were no drinking glasses and only two towels.  When we fllagged down a housekeeper, she brought us two glasses, unwrapped!  The fridge we'd requested (for cooling medication) prior to our arrival and at checkin time as well still hadn't arrived.  The door had to be slammed in order for it to close complletely. 

Still, all of these things were pretty insignificant when we stopped to consider that here we were in Vegas.  We decided that a soak in the hot tub would do wonders so I called the desk to ask if there were facilities in which to change clothes and what the procedure was for ordering drinks.  Imagine my shock to have been told that the beach was closed.  It was only open until 5:00 and it was now 6:30.  So, no hot tub.

We decided that maybe dinner would be a good idea and started getting ready to go out.  I wanted to check my email before we left, so unpacked the laptop and connected to the port on the desk.  Hmmm....it seems you need to pay for Internet...not even WiFi...at a charge of $14.95 per 24 hour period...ON TOP of the resort fee!  Oh, yeah...the resort fee.  My travel agent quoted it to me as $7.00 per day, which was less than some of the other hotels, so I figured no biggie.  When we registered at the front desk, the resort fee was $16.95.  I told the clerk there must have been some mistake.  She assured me there was not.  

Ready for dinner, we decided it would be fun to catch something on the strip and called down to ask when the next shuttle would be available ( during my previous trip, the place we stayed had a shuttle that picked up every half hour and ran from 10:00 am until 1:00 am).  Imagine my surprise...again...to be told very matter-of-factly that the last shuttle had gone at 5:00 and there wouldn't be another until the next morning!

So, in addition to the resort fee, the Intenet charges, add on the cost of taking cabs to and from every place you want to go.  And...every time you take a cab, you'll be tipping the attendant as well as the driver, round trip.

The next day, I called my travel agent to inquire as to what could be done to rectify the situation.  She spoke with the manager who told her that the registration clerk had been mistaken and that the resort fee was the $7.00 I'd originally been quoted and that the higher price would be instituted in April.  That was the best she could do and we decided to stick it out and make the best of things.

The next day we got ready to spend some time at the hotel beach.  It was nice and the water felt great!  After a few hours of relaxation in the pool and hot tub, we went back to our room to change and grab something to eat.  My boyfriend inserted the key card into the lock and...nothing!   We tried a couple more times...nothing!  A housekeeper was in the hall and we asked her if she could let us into the room since our key wasn't working.  She aplologized and said it was against rules for her to do so.  She told us to use the house",1,2,1

There are three adjectives that I use to describe this facility are rude, inefficient, and arrogant (plus tacky and unclean!)

On July 3rd, our Auto Club travel agent made a reservation for us for August 17 through the 19th.  We put the lodging fees on our credit card--had a receipt showing both the payment and the reservation.

On August 17th, after driving over 600 miles through rain and lightning storms from Northern California, I went to the front desk to check in for our family.  The clerk looked at his computer and said our reservation had been cancelled on July 17th (and our credit had still be charged).  I was shocked and showed him my receipt and reservation document.  He went to talk to his manager (Matthew) who basically told me that he would do what he could but if his superior said no we would be out of luck (that meant that my wife, daughter, and myself, after paying and making reservations, would have no place to stay.) 

I became furious because we had paid, the hotel staff had listed the wrong date on the reservation, and rather showing compassion and concern, Matthew showed as much warmth as an iceberg in the Arctic.  When I reacted in anger, he said he wasn't going to do anything that would guarantee us a stay. We then were forced to go find another hotel to stay at for the evening (this at 11:15 pm on a Friday night).

I wrote a letter to their CEO almost a month ago detailing what had happened and heard nothing back from him.

When it comes to reliability, courtesy, and concern, THIS HOTEL IS NOT A HARD ROCK IT IS A SOFT PEBBLE.",12,3,2

For sure I was going to give five stars no doubt, but and its very important to any resort which is 
- valet service 
-bell desk 
I can't say anything bad about the valet guys or the bell desk they are very well trained polite and very helpful if they are there , for some reason they are short hand, so if you find them they are very helpful.
Which in my check in and check out took about 30 minutes to find a bell desk person to assist us with the bags.
Moving on the review , I am staying here to attend an event with harmen company which was very organized from the casino , they had enough staff to take care of people .
Talking food in this casino it's awesome which I got to have breakfast at Mr lucky' and lunch at pink tacos and dinner at 35 steakhouse which I am gonna post reviews for each of them , but over all food wise they deserve five stars .
Rooms clean enough, organized and bed is comfortable.
Check in counter all the employees are super nice and they give the welcome smile .
About gambling I can't say so much because I don't gable due to my super busy schedule working but I had my friend with me and end winning some money at least left the casino with some extra cash.
At the end of the day I do recommend this hotel , it's not so pricey like the casinos on the strip and you still get the same service if not better , I hope next time we will see more staff for the valet service and the bell desk.",8,4,7

The location of the hotel is off the strip, by like 2 blocks...seriously, no big deal. They offer free shuttle service to the mall so it's perfect! 
The casino is smaller than those on the strip but it doesn't get over crowded and smokey. 
We were able to play the tables for hours without masses of people coming and going. We went to the Showtime Boxing matches they were having at The Joint, ticket prices were cheap and there was not a bad seat in the house! 
The room it self was a King City View, Out view consisted mostly of the HRH tower parking structure but no biggie. Bed was amazingly comfy, the couch easily sat 8 people the bathroom was out of this world, sunken tub for two a shower that could fit 3-4 with a ""rain"" shower head.
Everything about the room was great. It was clean and very spacious. We ordered room service that night and although pricey, service was quick and delish! Check in\/out was fine. 
The HRH tower has a separate parking structure and Check in Desk that is super PLUSH and really makes you feel like a VIP. Service was a tad slow, with one person at the desk for check in (although we checked in at 9 am) upon check out the next morning at 11, there were 3. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

The idea of having to go to the parking garage to get a wristband only to have to go through security (bagcheck and a patdown) was the most ridiculous thing I have experienced. I can understand the security part, but to have to do both was a hassle. In the parking garage, we had to see if our bags would fit which they did. Then going to the pool, miraculously it did not fit so we had to go back to our room to switch bags. Even security said the dimensions were different. Oh and God forbid you bring gum, medicine or your compact! This was on a Saturday and really no different than any other pool so I was really confused as a guest.

On a lighter note, the staff was great and funny. Very accommodating for the most part. My friend got upgraded so we did stay in a different tower (not one we signed up for) so that was interesting.

My sister and I really loved our stay, we got upgraded to a room in the Casino tower with a great view of the strip and the pool just because it was my sister's first time to Vegas! Shoutout to Kieta, the sweet front desk man. It pays to be chatty as you're checking in. 

We were disappointed by the lack of jacuzzi access. There was one pool open during the day but no jacuzzi, so our bathing suits went unused. We thought about buying a day pass to their spa facility, but after touring it, we passed. $27 for a tiny jacuzzi tucked in a corner didn't seem worth it. 

One of our two beds had a huge dip in it. My sister practically fell off the bed but managed to roll uphill and sleep on the other side. 

Great TV for watching the Bachelor - the important things in life. 

All about that free parking. I'd advise bringing some walking shoes and walking the 20 minutes to the strip. It's kinda a mirage, it looks really close but takes awhile. Totally worth it though, because we took a taxi after missing the shuttle and it cost almost $8. 

It's entertaining to walk around and explore. The best restaurants are Pink Taco (I reviewed it over on their page) and Culinary Dropout. Mr. Lucky's is great for breakfast (reviewed this one as well). You also have a great view of sad people playing slots all day every day. Super fun. 

I'd totally stay here again. You get some peace and quiet from the strip but you can still have plenty to do right in the hotel. We actually considered not leaving at all.....

Unfortunately months before my stay, Hard Rock implemented a policy which forces hotel guests who pay less then $150 a night on Sunday to pay the full cover charge of $100 at Rehab. That pretty much takes a portion of the HRH attraction away. Until they change this policy, I can never give this place a 5 star rating. 

Now on to the review! My first stay was in the casino tower mountain view room. This side I must say is quieter, and if you are looking for a better place to sleep, choose this side. My second stay was on the pool view, which featured two queen beds. I actually like this setup, especially on the weekends. Be prepared for your TV and all you room furniture to shake when you open your balcony door. It is never going to be noise proof cause you are right above the HRH pool.  Rooms itself are definitely 4  1\/2 star quality after the most recent renovations. The cleaning people do a great job of refilling soaps, and dirty towels. I have not had a problem with it all 4 nights per the two vacations I have stayed here.  Room size is absolutely excellent and perfect for a couple or maybe even 3-4 people in a double queen size setup. 

The demographics HRH attracts are the party people. So don't be bitching if you hear hell of a lot of noise in a room across from you at 5am in the morning. You are probably making a Vegas mistake if you are already in bed and listening to that noise during those times. My favorite factor about HRH is the size. It is small enough so it does not feel like you are walking through a mini-mall. Even with the new expansions, I was able to park in the new parking structure and get to my room within 10 minutes. That's absolutely amazing with today's mega hotels. Even if you get front door parking, it's usually an average of 20 minutes to go through all the hoopla. 

The features and amenities that catered the best to me was definitely the HRH pool. Unfortunately I was not able to check out Rehab Sundays on the last trip, and it was too cold to get in the water the previous trip, however I must say S.K.A.M. Saturdays is off the hook. They feature some top 40 with house music, and the crowd is alive and happening. Lots of top notch beautiful ladies as one would expect at any high class Vegas pool parties. Vanity, the best club in this joint is also one of my favorites. Please check my Vanity reviews if you want details (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/vanity-las-vegas-2#hrid:7Sw13T_sT6LTY2m-vGuILQ), but it is as classy as Vegas clubs goes. I would compare it to a smaller version of Tryst. A very sexy medium sized boutique club.

Lastly, who can forget those drunken adventures at Mr. Luckys 24\/7. It is absolutely hang over food at its best. Don't expect to get great service, or your meal to be prepared quickly especially when you come in at 6AM. However they do have a full menu available to you all day around the clock. It was perfect for me since I was never able to eat on a regular schedule on my Jack Colton forums debauchery invasions. Also for those of you that want to save a dime, you can walk across to either CVS or a couple of sandwich shops to grab a snack as well. 

Overall, I would say HRH is the perfect hotel for me. It delivers the party that I need, and at the same time gives me a class that I would expect at a Vegas resort. I am hoping that they can get that Rehab policy turned around, then I will definitely be looking into making this my permanent summer time getaway destination for years to come.",11,3,5

My family and I decided to stay here for a wedding party this past weekend. We've never stayed here before so we decided that it'd be an interesting experience. 

My first MAJOR killer was that the decor was extremely dated and so were the machines. The smell of cigar smoke along with other very nasty smells filled the air all the way to our room. It seems that this is one of the hotels that was a complete smoking section. It was honestly hard to find a section of this place that didn't reek of it. I guess that should be normal considering it is Vegas after all. I definitely recommend NOT bringing children or anyone who has troubles breathing here.

My second killer was the room itself. The room was pretty small and cramped comparing to other rooms for the price. I feel that a room for two queen beds would be more than sufficient room for two couples. The TV that was on the wall was a super dated 42 inch plasma screen that, more often than not, had a problem warming up and adjusting for the correct screen size to fit the picture.

The bathroom, it seemed very unclean. The tub itself has hard water stains which basically shows that it doesn't get cleaned correctly. All chrome or metal finishes have hard water spots as well. The nastiest part is the lime scale on the shower head (unsanitary). I didn't really feel safe at all showering with all that gunk all over everything. The toilet paper holder is bent and I'm actually amazed that it didn't just break off when I pulled tissue from it. 

A few side notes to finish this review off...
-No free wi-fi
-They only give you two towels so make sure to pack your own (Do it anyways, their towels smell like a bbq pit.)
-Don't touch the mini bar, there isn't anything interesting. ANYTHING THAT IS TOUCHED OR MOVED GETS CHARGED TO YOUR ROOM ***INSTANTLY*** SO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE GIANT BLOCK OF BS GOODIES.
-The only good restaurant in the place that I've found was the Culinary Dropout which I'll write a review about in a bit
-The machines are old and some are broken so you're better off playing the tables here
-Our room keys wouldn't work half of the time and they didn't want to give us new ones. They just kept scanning it to refresh the code
-There is no view of anything so don't expect one. Given, it is off of the strip but you need to dish out some money if you want the rooms facing the pool at least

To sum up my review. This place sucks. There was only old people and drunk foreigners so if you're into that, go for it. As for me, I might try out Planet Hollywood or something closer to the strip for the same price. I'm sure they'll take care of me way better than this place.",1,1,2

You can scoop up an HRH room for around the $100 mark most weeknights and they hold up against any room on the strip.

I was in town for the first weekend of March Madness.  The Hard Rock offered me a couple of comped nights and discounted rate for the third night, which was too good to resist for my Tues-Fri stay.  I had requested a non-smoking room with a king bed.  Unfortunately, by the time I got to the Hard Rock, the only non-smoking rooms available had two Queen beds, which really wasn't a problem.

I was put in a standard Casino Tower room on the 4th floor overlooking the pool.  Obvious to me, the Casino Tower rooms had been renovated since my last stay.  My room was clean, modern, and comfortable.  I liked the new look.  Fortunately unchanged over the years, my bed and pillows provided excellent support and a great night's sleep.  The Hard Rock's beds have always been a strength.  The shower had good water pressure.  Of note, though, hot water was never a problem in the morning hours, but it seemed to be somewhat in shorter supply (never cold but merely warm) in the early evening hours.  Outside noise wasn't a problem this trip since I was there midweek and the pool didn't appear to be open, but Casino Tower rooms facing the pool are definitely in the blast zone of noise from the weekend's Rehab pool parties.

Gambling at the Hard Rock was a huge disappointment.  All blackjack tables except for those in the high-limit room ($100 minimum) were 6:5, no surrender games, which was a surprise given its off-Strip location and it was in effect even during the daytime hours and midweek.  The Hard Rock did have multiple tables with lower limits (i.e. $10 and $15), but even $25 tables were at 6:5 BJ payouts.  The Hard Rock's sports book, while not a great place to watch the games, was not nearly as busy as sports books on the Strip, especially during March Madness.  I didn't compare betting lines between the various sports books, but it was surprisingly quick and easy placing bets at the Hard Rock sports book.

The Hard Rock will always hold a special place in my heart.  It remains a good place to for a midweek stay.  I will continue to avoid it like the Plague on the weekends.  Its dining options have only gotten stronger over the years.  However, I simply can't recommend it as a place to gamble.   4 stars for my room and dining options.  2 stars for gambling.",1,0,1

First off - Our room. D I S G U S T I N G!!! We had a moth infestation, which you can see from other reviews we were not the only ones. They blamed it on US, stating that it was because we opened the balcony doors.. we wouldn't we? It was a beautiful day out. Maybe if they would have warned us we wouldn't have dealt with that..

Their solution? 

Send up a man to spray the entire room with harsh chemicals while we were in there.. also squishing the moths INTO THE CARPET and leaving them!! We called again to complain and they said someone would be up later to vacuum the room for us.. WTF?
They sent someone to come up when we had left the room - also to find that our bags had been opened.

We went out .. came back around 2am, more moths.. obviously the door hadn't been opened again since then. After numerous phone calls to the front desk we got our rooms upgraded and was told ""if we had paid an extra $100 to begin with we would've been in the other towers and wouldn't have had that issue"" 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! 

So many other things went wrong with this hotel within a 24 hour time period, won't get into those details.. however I would never in a million years go back to this establishment.

The staff could not have been more helpful and we so accommodating. Even with some of the rowdy clients and guest, the staff always remained as cool as can be.  We were only there during the week.  I understand the weekends get a bit wild.  Lots of choices for food.  Ate at the pink taco, staff was great food was good.  Every morning we ate at FUEL our favorite.  Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches.  Fresh quick and healthy.  We hung out in the Cabanas for 2 days.  Highly recommend it.  Great way to get out of the sun, get some privacy and watch a little TV.  Hard Rock is off the strip which ends up being in your favor.  We were able to get away from some of the the busier hotels.  

The rooms in the tower are amazing. Clean, large, and stylish..  We had a light bulb out and they came and repaired it immediately.  Really friendly staff.  I think because they deal with so many tipsy people they are glad to help anyone clear headed and friendly.

Pros- 
check in was not too painful, maybe a ten minute wait
Room was very nice, obviously updated old tower since expansion
The beds were beyond comfy, I wanted to take their pillows with me!
Got a great deal on rates
Drinks in casino didn't break the bank unlike casinos like wynn (where I paid 20 bucks for a single shot!)
There are two pools so if you don't want to party at rehab and just want to relax there are options

Cons-
Don't think ill ever stay in paradise tower again
Room had no hot water and horrible water pressure. Washing my hair was a nightmare and it takes about 15 minutes to fill the bathtub halfway. 
We moved rooms because they said it was probably just an issue with that one, WRONG. slightly better but barely hot enough (I know its summer out there but I still like a hot shower) and the water pressure was worse in the new room
Outlets sucked, nothing stayed plugged in. 
We were next to the elevator, insanely loud 
And we opened our window to see our mountain view, to see a wall, and a low roof covered in trash, lost shoes, clothing, beer bottles, etc

First off for anyone considering Hard Rock be aware that it is NOT directly on the strip. For me this is a plus,  but this may be disappointing for some.  Also, there are 3 towers. If you want a more calm and luxurious setting then book HRH Tower.  This hotel attracts many young partiers and the majority stay in the Casino and Paradise towers.  Again if you want to avoid this then book HRH. Now people can't claim they didn't know. 

My first interaction with Hard Rock was purely the casino. I was there for a convention and most of its attendees used Hard Rock as their hub for meetups. I did extremely well in black jack and from there my experience just got better.  I had a great dealer that recommend I get a casino host,  so I asked for one. After talking with him we were given 2 nights comped in the HRH tower, this was surely due to the gambling.  I get it, keep them here so they give it all back.  But we had a lot of fun and went home after two extra relaxing days.  

Tip: if you gamble, GET A PLAYERS CARD.  Hard Rock offers so many comps and deals for people who acrew points.  I have received offers for free chips and shows.  In May we returned,  not for a convention,  but pure relaxation.  My same host got us free tickets to see guns n roses and Jim Jeffries.  We also received 4 days free in a corner suite in HRH. I have gambled in many hotels and I have never received this level of service. My host kept in touch with me the entire time to make sure everything was working out. All in all this is a great hotel which provides spectacular service.",7,0,1

The living room has a sectional couch with a television with surround sound. The bedroom had two queen-size beds with two sliding doors the beds were super plush and cloud like heaven. But the best part is definitely the bathroom. I'm not only do they have and amazing tub that can fit someone 6 foot. The shower has a rainfall setting with an additional attachment that really allows you to get relaxed. The soap bar as one of the best soap bars of ever had and a hotel not only doesn't have the massage side but and had some extracting things in it that really scrub my body and I felt super clean.

We arrived around 4:00pm on New Years Eve. Self-parking is pretty easy, and so is lugging your entire luggage (yes, I tend to over pack) and yourself into in the casino (hate wondering around a casino with your luggage looking for the check in desk). 
Entering into the hotel\/casino, the first thing I noticed outside of the all the awesome rock memorabilia was how clean the air smelled. No stinky smoky cigarette smells just good clean air that was moving around the casino.

Our check in was a breeze, and we actually were upgraded to a (wait for it, wait for it) a suite in the Paradise Tower!!!!!!!  I was so excited that I was jumping up and down on the inside. So what do you get while staying in the Paradise Tower? Well glad that you asked my swanky friends... You get:

-Exclusive check in
-Over 460 square feet of naught fun
-VIP lounge and spa
-Daily newspaper at your door
-40"" LCD flat screen TV
-IPod clock radio
-A fully stocked mini bar
-Free in room WIFI
-Premium bed with feather pillows 
-Luxurious bedding (our comforter was urber fluffy)
-A rain shower that could hold at least 10 people
-Prickly Pear & Verbena bath amenities (smelled like some sexy fun)
-Mood lighting all around

I especially loved the ""Do not disturb"" door sign. Our suite was pretty sound proof which was nice, except we did have a conjoining door to the next room at one point we just got back to our room from a night of drinking, I'm guessing our neighbors must have had gotten back as well. This one girl was so loud and annoying that not even the TV could drown out her voice. To make things even worst we were woken up around 8:30am to our neighbor who was awake along with her friends laughing and yelling like it was the middle of the afternoon.. Ugh, I just wanted to yell shut up, but then again I did not want to leave the comfortable bed. We just laughed it off and went back to sleep.

The machine had two very large dice in a plastic bubble that were mechanically activated by whomever was the shooter. Each player has a virtual keypad so they could place their bets. Four of my colleagues sat down at the machine and started to insert their cash into the machine to play. They felt this machine was the closest to an actual crap table.

The rooms look beat up and cheap. The older tower is actually much nicer. The smell of the hotel is overwhelming and cheap smelling. One thing that made me really uncomfortable about this hotel was their pool staff. Only one pool area was open when I was there. The pool closed at 4p ... At 3:50 two people from the pool staff came by the pool side literally tapping their feet and looking constantly at their watches saying ""I will not be staying here past 4 o'clock""... They then made me get out of the pool at 4 while staring at me as I dried off and put my clothes on... I felt so uncomfortable and violated. Cannot express how aggressive and rude they were.",1,0,0

I am a very frequent traveler - both business as well as for leisure - and thus spend much of my time in various hotels around the globe. 
Experiences always vary - and are of course linked to price (i.e.: you should get what you pay for). 
This hotel however is an icon of under performance and tops my list of bad experience! 

Here's what went wrong: 

(1) Check-in queue - waiting for roughly 30 minutes to check-in as the staff is too slow - and too little in number 

(2) Noisy lobby - that's fine, it's the Hard Rock - we want it like this - but this does not go well with grumpy staff that does not speak up loud enough - and international visitors might have trouble understanding a slurry English; never forget: they seem to forget that the first impression is the most important one - so don't let fools greet your clients 

(3) Booked a room with two beds and a decent view - got a room with 1 bed looking at the park garage 

(4) Immediately complained - was informed that a reservation only gives the right for a room, not what type... Now I am slowly getting pissy. ARE YOU KIDDING!!! I booked 2 months in advance - and the reservation system can't handle a request like 2 beds instead of 1??? Man - I like my buddy who was traveling with me - but not in my bed! 

(5) Person on phone said they might have something the next day (on Saturday? Really? How many people check-out on Saturday, not Sunday??) - but I need to call in the morning.... Hey - what about YOU CALLING ME? Pro-activeness?? 

(6) Next day, no other room available - no extra bed, no better view - but still paying the same price as booked. What I hear is ""Sir, this is not possible - you have the right to the room you are in - nothing else available. Good bye""... Not even: sorry, apologies - or maybe a free drink? Maybe even just the 8 dollar water bottle as a little gift? 

(7) So next day, 7am (still up - ok, a bit drunk) - I ask if I could at least extend check-out from 11am (11????) to maybe 2pm, as my flight is at 5pm. ""No sir, we have strict rules, check-out is 11"". Explained what all went wrong - but no: 11 - good bye. 

(8) Grumpy - packed our stuff - checked out at eleven - or better: stood in line at 10:45 - and finally checked out at 11:20.... 

(9) As we only had 2 people on the reservation we only got 2 wrist bands for the Rehab Pool Party - so asked if we could get two more (room states up to 4 people) for our friends. Guess what: ""No, these additional people were not stated"". No exceptions, nothing. 

(10) So head to Rehab entrance to see what can be done to get our friends in, too - so we can have fun and spend some more money. Nope - and what's worse, not event the two of us get in, as we're not staying the night from Sunday to Monday... REALLY???? We would need to spend 100 dollars each???? By now we're getting in to 4-letter-word terrain - we drop 700 dollars in pure room charges - and another 2'000 at restaurant, bar, club (not even mentioning the casino)??? And we can't go to REHAB without paying another 100 bucks? 

(11) OK - we leave - earlier flight to get the hell out of here - stand in taxi line for another 25 minutes - and finally escape. 


I hardly ever give bad feedback like this - but even today (hangover gone, head's all clear) the money spent at this place was completely wasted, and I have had better treatment in 8 dollar pousadas in Brazil. 
Admittedly, they're getting away with it - but it'll catch-up: great places like the Mandarin Oriental offer a really cool bar, immaculate service - and comparable rates. 
Brands never ensured the survival of a company - service however does.",9,3,2

I have to tell you that we're not old (we're in our 20s), we're not prudes and we enjoy rock and roll, but... we didn't enjoy the Hard Rock.
Right off the bat we were caught off guard by the $100 a night hold on your credit card. We hadn't budgeted that in. Goodbye to that money while we were in Vegas! 
We weren't impressed with the apathetic ""rock-star"" attitudes of many of the staff. We were there during Rehab and thought maybe the increased security and lack of professionalism stemmed from that.  We were hassled by security going up to our room even though I showed them my key. Apparently you aren't ""allowed""  outside alcohol in your room, I saw them stopping a few different people. Nice tactic to get you to pay for their alcohol! 
We were impressed with security at The Joint. They were kind, funny and good at their jobs. A+ to them! We were also impressed with our awesome bellhop at the end of our stay. He earned his tip! He kept us entertained from our room to our car. He was from Brooklyn, New York and the nicest employee we encountered all weekend. :)
The room was nice and clean (except for the glass of cigarette butts on our balcony the whole time) and we liked the decor. 
We did like the smaller casino and the food at Pink Taco was pretty good.

Sadly those no longer happen but I'll always fondly think of it as where I stayed for my 21st birthday... and some random weekend in April 2010... and my 23rd birthday....

Wow. Time flies.

Unless you have a pool facing view, avoid the Casino rooms and go for the Paradise Towers instead. It's worth the price increase. Paradise rooms are all new with awesome amenities and plushy beds to lay your weary head down for for 45 minutes. They just feel so much cleaner. Think of it this way, less coke has been blown in the Paradise rooms compared to the much older Casino rooms.

As you might have guessed, the crowd that stays here is more of the ""young-and-forever-a-rocker-at-heart"" variety. I would never consider this a family friendly place unless you like the idea of explaining alcohol and (especially) drugs to your children at a very young age. Save the kiddos for the Bellagio or something more PC.

This hotel has lots of fun restaurants inside to recover from at all hours of the day. I think every time I stayed here I ended up at Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 at some ungodly hour noshing on something deep fried covered in fat. It was heaven. There's also Pink Taco for your normal eating pleasure as well as Nobu to indulge in fancy sushi.

It's also home to my favorite pool on the strip, Rehab and Vanity Nightclub. Rehab. Really, the pool is the best. Softly sloping sandy beaches, palm trees, islands and cabanas all around. Rehab, the HOTTEST pool party in Vegas takes place at their pool every Sunday from April through October. Vanity is their new club that basically replaced Body English which opened in 2009.

Bottom line: the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is located off the strip which can be a pain but it is definitely worth the trip if you are coming or staying for the pool and Rehab!

I think there may have been more specific complaints we had, but that's all I remember right now since that last stay was last March and I haven't been back. The Paradise Tower room was much nicer in terms of decor, cleanliness, and overall comfort. It was much more rock n' roll than the regular room, which was basically all white without much standing out. I don't plan on staying at this place again, though I would consider it if I knew I was getting something as nice as Paradise Tower.",0,0,0

GOOD :  

* Room was clean and spacious.
* Comfortable bed and pillows.
* We did not eat at the Hard Rock Café, so no comment on that, but it's right in the same parking lot.

NOT SO GOOD: 

* Only one set of towels per person, on the thin and skimpy side.
* Not car-traveler friendly - elevators are extremely far from parking lot\/parking garage, with no luggage carts. You have to haul all your stuff through the casino - suitcases, tote bags, ice chests, kids toys, etc. Not a good experience.
* Toilet paper thin, rough and ineffective. We found a store and bought our own toilet paper.
* Not enough wall outlets for charging phones, cameras, laptops, etc. near the bedside tables, desk, TV cabinet, etc. There are some random outlets around the room, but not near anything to set your phone or camera on, unless you want to set your phone down on the floor. We ended up putting our luggage, etc. in random places around the room to be able to plug in our electronics.
* Hard Rock is not close to The Strip - just be aware. On the map it looks like a few blocks, but really it's about a mile. You can walk it if you want, but if the weather is threatening, or if you're going to be coming back at night, plan on taking a cab ($10 - $12). 
* If you are walking around, be alert for panhandlers, homeless, drunk, and just plain crazy people.  Stay aware of your surroundings, and don't trust anyone, even if they look perfectly normal they may still well be asking you for money. We did not encounter any violent people on the back streets, but I felt like we well might have. I did not feel particularly safe.
* Lack of attention to detail from the maid staff - floor lamp was crooked, another lampshade was crooked, the TV was crooked on the wall, there was a writing pad but no pen, there was no ""do not disturb"" sign. We asked a maid in the hallway for a DND sign so we could lay down and rest, and she was very friendly and helpful.
* Restaurants in the hotel are expensive and not that great.",0,0,0

It ranges from cheap to moderate depending if you get it as a deal online or if you have the players card and can get deals for as low as $19 a night. The tables in the club are less then others. Yes it is off the strip. 

But to me as a music lover of all kinds, there is nothing like walking in and seeing all the costumes and covers of the records. In the summer the pools are full of life and excitement. 

If you do have a players card, when you go back and stay with the players card you do not pay the resort fee. 

The rooms are big, if you get a handicap room they are beyond huge. I personally found the beds beyond comfortable. The service is great! I have never been disappointed. And the view from some of the rooms are great. If you have a chance you really should try the spa. In addition, the choice of restaurants downstairs is amazing from PINK TACO to Mr. Lucky's 24\/7, Nobu and more. 

The only down is it is off the strip, and while you could walk it is not the safest walk. But if you stay there you will certainly have a good time without paying some of the crazy expenses that that you might not want to pay all the time. 

Even if you do not get a chance to stay there or choose not to you should certainly stop by and check out the music memorabilia!",0,0,1

We stayed here over Columbus Day weekend for a friend's 30th Bday celebration. We got a king suite with an adjoining two queen room in the Paradise Tower. 

Strike 1: They advertised a pullout couch and there was NO pullout couch. We called for a rollaway which they wanted to charge $20 a night. Excuse me? False advertising and I have to pay for it?! Called three times until finally got the rollaway in the room delivered. 

Strike 2: Asked for Nonsmoking room but the room reeked of smoke which did numbers on my allergies. I know I'm in Vegas, but I don't have to breath that crap while I sleep.

Strike 3: the shower did not drain and water pooled up to my ankles. Called maintenance to repair and yet again they didn't show. Left for Pool\/Brunch 4 hrs later returned with it still clogged. Called second time and finally they fixed it after waiting around 30 min before we could get ready for dinner. 

Strike 4: There is no room in the fridge for your own refreshments and a fridge is again $20 a day.  Seriously for a suite what good is an in room bar without a fridge? For the price of the room it should be available. Guess they don't want you not buying THEIR drinks.

Strike 5: As a hotel guest we should get free admission to the day pool parties at least on a guest list. Nope still have to pay- seriously? Marquee Day Club offers this to their hotel guests why can't Hard Rock?

Strike 6: the TV cable was so horrible and kept cutting out couldn't play any music stations from that and there was no Auxillary input to plug in our own music thru the TV speakers. 

When we complained to the reception they only comped us one resort fee wow a whopping $22.50.  

I have stayed multiple times at the Hard Rock San Diego which is newer and has better rooms.  They have the aux cable, working showers and correctly advertised rooms.

I've stayed here a number of times through the years and somehow always hope it would be better next time. Though this time was no exception. Meh

The room was clean as you'd desire, the shower in the paridise tower is great if you choose your hotel based on your ability to have sex in a giant shower with dark slate interior as I certainly do... but

There are no coffee pots, you must get dressed to go down and stand in que with the rest of the Vegas morning zombies. Seems to be a profitable decision on the part of the corporate hotel owners which will probably never return then. 

The ""beach party"" that runs from 11am to 7pm will completed destroy any attempt you may have on sleeping during that time. So wake up early, and no naps. The JBL sub-woofers rattle the windows without mercy for the hungover or the late night Vegas guest. 

We tried the beach party, and sexism is alive and well where the cost of admittance for a penis is double for that of a bikini. In this day and age I find sexist pricing structures..well..sexist. Further, the DJ sucked, the hot tubs were luke warm, and there is no where to secure your things or stash your flipflops. There is literally no where to even sit down less you pay 1000 for a couch.

I have stayed there twice and both times I have enjoyed the experience. 

When walking through the hotel hallways, everything is decorated with rock infused concepts. They are also always playing rock music which totally sets the tone. 

The actual hotel rooms, are very spacious. The TV's are nice, the beds are very comfortable, the sheets are nice, and the pillows are fluffy.

I am conscious of the negative aspect of internet culture that allows people to make unduly harsh comments at a high rate.  With that in mind, these are my honest feelings about my stay.  

As soon we arrived, we were hit with 80's hair metal cranked to 11 with no place to escape, except our room. On every inch of the hotel prepare to enjoy Dokken's greatest hits, and that deep cut from Warrant.  Our sleep this weekend was interrupted by the person who thought it was wise to decorate the hallways with actual drum cymbals.  I'm wondering if anyone during the design process considered the possibility that some guests might try to show off their drumming skills on the way back to their rooms after a night of drinking.  Needless to say, there were a lot of John Bonham wannabee's staying on the 9th floor.
 
Keeping with the theme of sleep deprivation, we were couldn't sleep due to the blinking smoke detector installed right above our bed.  When all the lights were shut off, and the black curtains were closed, the blinking smoke detector lit up the room like the lamest rave imaginable. This could go on for pages, so I'll continue with a shorthand checklist of problems:
- Guest Services was terrible.  I had to call 5 times to get an engineer to the room to fix the air conditioning.
- There were no responsible adults to be seen on staff.  All the employees are either in Motley Crue shirts, or working valet.  I really felt like if I complained about anything, they would shrug their shoulders and say ""sucks bro."" 
- There is no place to relax in the hotel unless you want to pay 25 dollars for the spa.  The pool is a giant party filled with cellulite and Bro culture. 
- The food tasted cheap,  like it was cooked by the gallon and over-sauced.

I had reserved the room on Expedia, and when I got there to check in they told me they were needing to upgrade me to a suite because the room they had originally planned to give me was unavailable - thought I had hit it lucky!  Unfortunately, the suite left something to be desired.  Lights were dim or unavailable, furniture had cigarette burns in it (they had some sort of loveseat thing that looked like it was straight out of a low-rent porn video - did not sit on that one).  No plugs for charging your cell phone near the bed!  Also found a broken charm bracelet type thing sitting next to the bed, and the sinks were leaky.  Bed was OK and seemed clean, but I had some doubts... Really disappointed and wouldn't stay here again.

We came to the Hard Rock for a show at Vinyl. My impression of the casino itself was pretty good; you are immersed in the rock atmosphere. This place had a bunch of venues like the Joint, Friday Night live at the pool, etc. 

There's  shopping, restaurant. There is a tattoo place just in case you feel impulsive and or drunk after a concert- feel free to get tatted up- YOLO!

Back in the day, it was chill and cool. Used to see celebrities left and right. We even rolled dice with Bruce Willis..

I recently was in Vegas for a few days, but didn't get a chance to drop by Hard Rock to reminisce.  I did see a billboard with Pauly D on it. Damn! What's this world coming to. Guess Hard Rock is on the decline if it has to stoop to Jersey Shore.

It was the WORST hotel ever!! The hotel is modern, and cool with the rock n roll stuff yes, but the customer service was terrible and the non smoking room was dirty.  There was black mold in several places in the room (Casino Tower) and the power went out several times on the 1st night.  So the hotel was running on generators so very little AC was on.  The electronic casino games would turn off and under NV law, you are SOL if you are playing on one when that happens.  You then have $zero!! Our room's temperature was in the mid-hi 80's.

We had dinner on night #1 in Nobu which is a very classy and expensive japanese restaurant and after our appetizers we waited 40 minutes for the waiter to finally come back and tell us that from the power problems, the gas lines were also not working...so no dinner, no discount. Just pay and leave now please.

Day #2, still no AC.  The front desk said ""if you don't like it, you can check out"".  There was a message on our room's phone and they said there was a problem with the authorization on the credit card.  My boyfriend went down to the front desk again and it was a mistake.  There was NO problem and the manager did apologize for the the mistake.  I went back to our room to take a shower and security was pounding on our door and order us to vacate immeadiatly and they were locking down our room for the lack of credit card authorization!! My bf told them we were just at the front desk and it was a mistake.  They didn't call to confirm this, and made us pack up right then and get out...my hair dripping wet but they didn't care.  My bf rushed again to the front desk and demanded the manager again....she apologized and placed us in another room.  No comps for the mistake and no upgrade either.  This new room had even more mold in the bathroom too.  

Day #3 As hotel guests we were told the charge for Rehab would be $100 for men, $75 for ladies.  The lounge chairs on the DJ side were an additional $200 per chair or $100 on the side without the DJ + a $100 minimum per chair for food\/drinks.  Insane!!! We later found out from others that they were only charged $25 per person to get in!!! Oh yes, we finally got AC!!

Also, security wants to see not only your hotel key but also your ID to get on the elevators to your room which makes no sense as your name is not on your hotel key.  

We were treated so poorly by the hotel personal and not comped in any way for the terrible service and lack of AC.  They could've cared less.  

They get actually a minus stars here, but that wasn't an option.  I will NEVER stay at this hotel ever again.",0,0,0

For the price, the rooms are great and very clean. i've stayed in both Casino Tower and Paradise Tower, and the rooms are essentially the same. Our stay in Paradise Tower was great, but in Casino Tower, we had a bit of trouble with the shower - the water was lukewarm and didn't start getting hot until the end of the shower. Wah I need my hot showers (minus 1 star). The tubs are also small. You also can't come home with leftovers; there's no fridge space and you can't move things! But the beds are SOOO COMFORTABLE!!! Huge down pillows and comforter and nice soft sheets. 

Being off the strip, the area is quieter, yet the casino is still bustling. The drive to the strip is very short too! I love the location, and it's great for avoiding traffic on the strip. 

The casino is my favorite part. Hard Rock is the best place to play. The music is always good. Nowhere else can you play BJ to such great rock music! In my opinion, the dealers here generally have better personalities, and the company is definitely more fun!

Like the cougars downstairs, this hotel has been ridden hard and left out wet. It needs to be remodeled. The staff is generally aloof, prefering to be cool rather than hospitable.

My boyfriend and I have been working a lot and we decided we needed a vacation to get away and have some fun so we came to vegas. We reserved a standard room and was put in the newly ""renovated"" Casino tower. Not sure what they renovated because our bathroom door had peeled paint, the bed was old and could really feel the springs, and there was dust all over the bedside tables. But whatever, we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room anyways, I was wrong. Went down to the pool the next morning, there were no workers at the towel stand and not towels put out, we asked multiple employees where we could get towels and were sent on an egg hunt. Finally found two towels and went to get a chair by the pool. As soon as my boyfriend stepped in the sand he stepped right into gum. GROSS! We stayed by the pool for maybe an hour before going into Pink Taco for some lunch, this is where things went bad. I ordered the al pastor tacos and shouldn't have because I ended up getting food poisoning. We were stuck in the room for the last part of the day and almost the entire night in extreme pain. At around 10pm I could finally get myself downstairs to try to eat some food. We went to Lucky's diner and ordered some chicken fingers and pasta. The servers were confused as to who was responsible for us, but finally we got Clay. He barely came around but spent a lot of time chatting with the table next to us, at the end of our meal he came over with our check, we put down our cards only for him to come back for signatures after charging our cards the other tables bill. They had order shots after shots of Jameson so very quickly we noticed how high the bill was all of a sudden.

The lady who checked us in was absolutely wonderful, her name was Alexis I believe. She switched our room from facing a parking garage to the poolside which was awesome since it was my boyfriends first time in vegas. After she explained how to get to our room we headed off.

We ended up with two queens instead of a kind but that's okay because the view was totally worth it. The room was pretty clean and fully stocked with toiletries(shampoo ,conditioner , body wash , lotion). It was also stocked with plenty of towels. The beds were very comfy and clean it felt like sleeping on a cloud. Free tv channels was a nice touch as we got to see some of our favorite shows on our down time. I highly recommend signing up for their backstage pass rewards as you earn points towards things at the hotel. Plus anything you purchase here you earn points for.

Let's start with the good.  The lady who checked me in at the front desk was nice and the lady who later gave me my room key was funny.

*That pool.  If you took a look at Rehab from up high, you wouldn't step in that dirty cesspool.  You can see a ring of filth around the edge.
*Dark dingy hallways wreaking of cigarettes
*Run down rooms
*People smoking in the casino
*People smoking in the casino sitting on the ground in the hallway in front of The Joint. Classy clientele.
*Rude housekeeping - not just to me, but to 2 other people in my unofficial group
*Got charged for a mini bar item that probably got knocked over but not consumed so their sensors just charged me for something and I didn't feel like contesting the charge
*This wasn't the hotel staff but when you have retail tenants who are calling your guests ""stupid fucking strippers"", that potentially hurts your business, too. 
*I was there for a convention with workshops in different rooms of the Muse and Artist halls.  Some of the rooms were not fully partitioned and you could hear loud distracting talking and music coming from the adjacent room.  I asked the convention organizers never to hold it there again.  It was at a different and better casino 3 years in a row prior.
*I checked out of there yesterday and I have not received an itemized receipt for my stay.

Now, I've stayed here before a couple times when it was actually nice.  It just has not been well kept and there seems to be no service standards.

I will say that The Joint is a nice venue for shows but that's not enough to warrant another star.

The lovely young poolside waitstaff are quick to offer you a drink, very VERY slow to actually bring it, in a big damn hurry to clear it away if you leave it for even a few moments and 100% unwilling to reveal drink prices. My Dad would never have ordered a $55 pitcher of Sangria, never. My stepmom's vodka rocks? $17, billed as ""Grey Goose shot"". They didn't have the Arnold Palmer I requested, probably because the 20something server didn't know what it was, and then was told it didn't contain alcohol so they must try to upsell me on something else. I ordered a lemonade& vodka, which was $19, in a tiny cup and 90% ice. When the bill came for our food and bev, it came to $300. There were 5 of us. There was a gratuity already included, but then there were ""additional recommended gratuity"" calculations, and my Dad, frazzled with the death of his brother (yes, we were in Vegas for the first time for a funeral) and the care of his 95 year old mother, ended up accidentally tipping $100 for service that was, frankly, worse than lousy.  

In our rooms, there were mini-bar items, but no immediately visible warnings that touching any of them led to an immediate charge for them. This rendered the fridge useless, as an attempt to put anything in it moves the items the hotel has stocked, so you are charged $$$ for sodas you didn't drink if you try to store that half-sandwich from Mr. Lucky's you didn't finish. There were no in-room microwaves, nor coffeemakers, and I ended up feeling as if HRH is out to squeeze every customer for each and every dollar they've brought.

5 stars for the conference staff - the event planner, caterers, catering manager, etc. were all exceptional to work with and really worked with us to make sure that our meeting went exceptionally well

5 stars for the business center woman being AWESOME and friendly. She was super helpful when I was trying to print things last minute for the meeting.

3 stars for the conference room (Monterey) - the acoustics made it difficult to hear at times but microphones made up for it. 

5 stars for the hotel rooms. Super modern, trendy, and reasonably priced at $69 a night for our group rate.

2 stars for my check-in experience. Had to go to 3 different check-in desks before I found the right one. Some of the staff had no idea what they were talking about and kept sending me in circles.

And find one you must so that you can get a Hard Rock shot glass from whichever city you happen to be in. Well, for me, anyway.

In all honesty, most of the casinos in Vegas look the same after a while. Sure there are bells and whistles that they add in order to try to outdo each other. But at the end of the day, they have the same things: a building with lots of lights and a potentially weird shape for its gimick, casino, mostly naked women, clubs with obnoxious cover charges, and expensive restaurants. 

But Hard Rock stood out just a little bit to me. Maybe it was because they had the only bartenders who carded me the whole weekend. Maybe it was because the craps dealers were a lot of fun and kept calling me ""Lady Luck."" Maybe it was the hot, but not impossibly hot pole dancers who didn't make me feel bad about my own body. But it was most likely their hard rock soundtack, something you would expect from the name sake. It was very refreshing to walk into a casino that sounded more like a spiffed up and updated dive bar juke box rather than like a bad day at Movin' 99.7* like the other casinos.

This place has definitely gone down hill. The front desk staff were rude and unwelcoming. The rooms have always been a good size but have aged quite a bit. The rain feature in our shower didn't work, the iPod dock didn't work, and they never bothered to come and clean our room (even though we called for housekeeping before we left the room). At the end of our stay they messed up our bill and then accused us of making the mistake! The rooms were suppose to be comp'd but they said that I requested a double upgrade so that's why they were charging me $300. I had to sit there and argue with the front desk lady until FINALLY she said she'd call someone. So when she called someone regarding my reservation, she figured out that I was right and the rooms and resort fee were suppose to be comp'd! So WHY couldn't she do that in the first place instead of accusing of us of making the mistake automatically?!? No apology was given, hence the 2 star rating. 

Room size: 5 stars
Room quality: 3 stars (broken shower and iPod dock)

We arrived at the hotel a bit after 2:00pm.  Sad Trombone...check in time is 3:00.  And, YOUR room probably won't be ready until 5:00pm.  The guy at the desk starts to suggest ""upgrading"" to a room with a view of the Strip (more on that later).  He has a tablet with lots of great pics to aid in the upsell.

My wife agrees to the upgraded room, and suddenly the desk guy springs the mandatory $30 per day ""Resort Fee"".  This allows us to actually use the amenities at the hotel.  What is the point of staying at a place like this, if you can't use the pool?

When we get to the room in the Paradise tower, we quickly realize that the only view of the Strip, is if you put your face against the window and look toward the window frame.  The room faces south and the strip is due west. 

The next day, we head off to the pool.  There are several pools, so we just to walked to the nearest.  As I walked through them door, a hulking, pierced ""security"" guy blocked my path.  He suggested that I go to the ""family pool"".  I later realized that this was the Rehab High Energy Party pool.  No old folks allowed!

Keep in mind, I only stayed one night, but I'm very picky. Very anal-retentive about cleanliness. and VERY intolerant of loud, drunken people carrying on and demanding attention from anyone that will give it to them. That being said, I didn't experience any problems with said possible grievances. 
We booked the room for a night for only $70, which I think is great because I'm used to $150-$200 a night at shabby hotels in no name places Virginia. They placed a mandatory $50 security hold on my card but as soon as I checked out, the hold was immediately dropped so don't worry about that.
We got a free room up-grade and were facing the pool. Yeah, I didn't really care either. 
The room itself was very clean and sleek. It had a sort of loungey vibe to it, everything was grey, black, and red. I was expecting your typical beige and green floral bull that every hotel seems to go with. The bathroom was a little small, but the shower was gargantuan.
The bed was by far the most comfortable bed I've ever sleeped on. I can't sleep in hotels. I'm always in pain, laying awake for 90% of the night and I get headaches from the slightest discomfort in any pillows. The second I laid down on this bed descended from the heavens themselves, I fell asleep within minutes and woke up in the morning pain-free. 
The only cons is that there was no hair dryer. It's okay. I brought my own. But what if I hadn't? Just saying. You never know. Also, there's a LOT of walking if you're staying in the Paradise Towers. The casino and concierge seems like it takes forever to get to.
The hotel is a little far from the strip but still walkable. Maybe 3 blocks or so. It's a good deal if you don't care too much about being right where the action is but still not missing out on too much.

I came here for a concert, and the Joint venue here is a good one- but after visiting not one, not two, but THREE different restaurants (happy hour, dinner, and coffee), I was underwhelmed by the both the service and product at all of them, I can't really recommend this place, even for a staycation.

We didn't arrive in Las Vegas until 11 p.m., so we had a late check in. When we walked up to the front desk, we were told we were ""upgraded"" to the HRH, the newer hotel. I wouldn't call it an ""upgrade"", just a newer hotel, which I'm assuming was cleaner and nicer than the other hotel tower. The beds were great and comfortable. The room or the floor did not smell of smoke at all which is a major plus. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the bathroom door didn't lock. Good thing I was comfortable with everyone I traveled with. 

The only down fall was the 4.99 steak 'n' eggs breakfast at the restaurant off the casino. One friend and I ordered our steak medium rare and did not feel so great later on. There was a more expensive steak 'n' egg option (leading me to believe the steak was not too sketch), but hey, you live you learn. It's also far from the Strip, but we were really only there to crash.

Would definitely stay here again.",0,0,0

My boys and I were here for the Fetish and Fantasy Ball, which was an incredible experience in and of itself, but here's everything else:

+5 for the room itself.  Comfortable, useful, lots of space, although not nearly enough mirrors (when you're one girl staying with three guys though, I guess there's no room for complaining).  Pillows were a bit too soft for my taste, but the boys sleeping on the floor loved the comforters :)

-1 for the shower curtain.  What the hell?  Water all over the bathroom floor = not a good time.

-1 for the pool music being blasted at 9am even though nobody was there.  This happened two days in a row.  I never want to hear Katy Perry hung over ever again.

+1 for the security at the elevators.  I'm sure things get crazy and whenever he wasn't around, some drunk lost insane person always managed to sneak in to the elevator with us.

+1 for the bitch dealers in the middle of the night\/early morning.  I'm in love with you (even though you took all of Craiggers' money).

-1 for the cymbal lights in the hallway.  Sorry Jared, but I'm pretty sure my drunky friends were some of those people banging on them in the middle of the night\/morning.  Cool looking, but dumb idea, especially when your head is pounding.

-1 for the in-room toiletries and towels.  Seriously, for how much you charge for your rooms, the least you could do is provide higher quality towels and soaps\/shampoos\/etc.  Big disappointment.

Hence, three stars:  A-OK.",1,1,1

Not sure when this changed, but now you have to pay for your drinks even if you play video poker at the bar. They will throw in a couple freebies, but I always thought if you were playing, they were buying...Huh. Doesn't matter because I am not a big drinker or gambler.

I stayed here after Christmas in 2003. What a blast I had. I love the big expansive, modern spacious rooms. The amenities were luxurious. I had a room facing the pool area. Since it was December it was closed.  I ate at Pink Taco, the 24 hour cafe. I love the circular way this hotel is designed.  

What better way to party than to get drunk at one of the Hard Rock discos and then stumble to your room for an after-party. Gambling is a little pricey....  $10.00 min to play Black Jack. I forget what drinks cost. We had a bar in our room. Gin and Tonic.  I kept drinking Mudslides also.  

I like staying off the strip sometimes. The traffic and parking is less stressful.  Here is some info on the Hard Rocks...  We stayed here prior to the sale.

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is a hotel-casino located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The property has a 646 room hotel and 30,000ft (3,000m) casino. The hotel will undergo a major expansion to be completed in 2009.

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is an expansion of the Hard Rock Cafe franchise.

It is known for its youthful appeal, elaborate swimming pool area (home of Rehab), and exclusive nightclub Body English. Along with The Palms (another off-strip resort) the Hard Rock both appeals to the 21 to 30 crowd and those who enjoy the Neo-retro feel of Las Vegas.

The hotel was opened in 1995 by Peter Morton, a co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe franchise.

On June 27, 2002, John Entwistle, the bassist of The Who, died at the hotel from a heart attack.

On April 6, 2006, professional skateboarder Danny Way acid-dropped off the guitar on the cafe into a quarter pipe setting a world record.

On May 11, 2006, Morton agreed to sell the property to Morgans Hotel Group for $770 million. The sale and transfer of ownership was completed in February 2007.

what gives the hard rock a 1 star review from me is the experience we had when trying to leave. we were trying to make it back to the palazzo for jersey boys. we figured we had left ourselves plenty of time to make it back (about 45 mins). we get outside and the line for cabs was enormous. the guys outside are yelling 'no taxis tonight. take a towncar. $45! $55 for this lexus! $85 for this limo.' 

they run a scam with the hard rock to make money. because we were in a rush and had already waited about 20 mins, we took the  $45 town car. it was a $10 cab ride over. absolutely ridiculous. on the ride to the palazzo, we kept hearing over the radio 'hard rock to base. we need two suvs ect...' the guy who drove us told us they paid the hard rock $5 for every ride they picked up there.

My experience was the worst experience I have ever had on vacation. I expected a lot more from a Hard Rock Hotel.  The room was very dull and smelled of old, musty cigarettes. The bathroom was dark and very small (like something you would find in a cheap motel).   
   On our first morning there we decided to go to the pool that we had heard so much about. We went downstairs, were searched, and wristbanded before we were allowed outside in the pool area. It turns out we had accidentally entered the VIP pool section (there were no signs indicating this was the wrong entrance) when we tried to put our towels on a beach chair we were told that it would be a $250 MINIMUM to reserve these chair!!! Are you kidding me!!!! They informed us that anything you spent in food or drink at the pool would come off this fee, but there is no way I am going to drink $250 worth while I am at the pool for a couple hours!!!!! We were then told that we needed to go to the ""commoners"" pool on the other side of the pool area to find free chairs. As we were walking past the cabanas to find our way to this other pool we stopped a gentleman to ask for directions. When we told him what had happened and that we were trying to find our way to the other pool he replied ""We usually don't let GA's walk through here but since it is early I guess I can let you through"". Was he serious??? I couldn't believe he had just said that to us (and yes, he was serious). It was like 10:30 in the morning and there was no one in the cabana's yet anyways. That made me feel like I was cheap and worthless. These people were being rude and outcasting my husband and I because we were not going to pay $250 to have a pool chair to loung in?!?!?!?!?
   HRH is also know for their ""rehab"" pool party on Sundays. This is a bunch of rowdy people (mainly college students) that get drunk at the pool all day. I am 26, so I'm not too far from the average at at the party, but even this was too much for me! While my husband and I were in the taxi line to go to a show and a nice dinner for our last night in town, we had to wait in line with all of the drunk, rowdy kids. I got bumped into more than once by drunk girls that could not stand up straight. This, ontop of the yelling and cussing was extremely frustrating and not how I wanted to spend an elegant date night with my husband. 
     Finally, the worst part... Our last morning there, my husband decided to use the TV check out from our room to save us the time of waiting in line downstairs. We still had a little packing to do after he checked out so we were going to be about another 45 minutes to an hour. Before we were finished, a girl from housekeeping knocks on the door and asks why we are in there because the room was marked as ""vacant"". We explained to her that we checked out on the TV and would be finished packing in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she knocks on the door again and starts getting a nasty attitude with us. THEN SHE CUSSES AT MY HUSBAND!!! She tells us how her manager is on her to get the ""f''ing"" room clean. Pretty much yelling at us as she says this!!! I could not believe that housekeeping just yelled and cussed at us because we were still packing our belongings. Under NO circumstances should this EVER happen. 
   My husband called from the airport that afternoon to complain and all we got was, ""I'm sorry, let me credit you a day of resort fees"" which was a whopping $18!!!! Are you serious??? That's all the corrective action that you can afford to do after all that???? I don't think we ever saw that credit either. HRH can keep their money and they can also make sure that I will warn everybody about how horrible we were treated while we were there.",2,1,0

My room was a little tired with a view of the hotel rooftop. It was older and needed a refresh but who can complain with the $46 a night deal I found on the Internet. I was in Vegas to watch my daughters B-ball tournament over the weekend so I really didn't care about the accommodations.

They have the coolest rock & roll memorabilia hanging on every wall. From Slash in my elevator lobby to an old Black Sabbath T-shirt in a hallway. I was overwhelmed looking at all the cool rock paraphernalia everywhere.

Had a few hours gambling and didn't feel like playing at the tables but I found this cool game from the movie The Hangover (classic Vegas) Movie, I played it and laughed my ass off. Recommended! 5*****sar game.

-all restaurants served overpriced poor quality food with even worse service. 
-was given a room with dysfunctional shower and sink
-room service would not come until I had to call and complain and ask for an accommodation, in which they gave me some mini shampoos off of their housekeeping cart. Wonderful.
-asked concierge recommendations of some restaurants and she was very condescending. As if I asked her to do something that wasn't within her job description. 
-guests were vomiting on the carpet of the casino 
-was charged a $22\/day service fee for a free shuttle that was not worth the use. 

Only positive: the beds. It sure was nice to sleep off all of the blood boiling this hotel had done.",5,2,1

-W Hotel like rooms.  Green & Purple dominated.
-Pool side was still the day time attraction.  Baking in 100 degree weather while being served by a lovely bevy of beautiful cocktail waitresses.
-Casino Bar which was the ""it"" place to hang all night.  Grab a drink, mix & mingle.
-""THE JOINT"" concert theater, where every seat was great, yet, comming and going was a nightmare.
-Babys was thee CLUB.  Dark, crowded, hot female bartenders w\/ sterling silver bottle cap openers lodge behind their backless outfits.
-Thee place to hook up, hang out, and party like a rock star.  It was hip, cool, and fun.  Booze, women and drugs..... It was oh so good, yet oh so wrong, cuz you paid dearly with a hangover the size of mount rushmore.

We stayed between two places.     Compared to the Palazzo - this place was younger and cooler in my opinion.  

If you are looking to be close to the strip - this place is not for you. 



The Pool:
HRH - has a huge pool and music throughout the complex.    I highly recommend renting a cabana if you are with a group.    We had 6 guys in our group and had the cabana all day.    The pool provides a sand bottom in some areas as well as the traditional pool floor in other areas.    

The Gambling:
Preferred the Palazzo.   Not as cool or good.   You can lose your money at both places easily.

The Food:
The Palazzo has more options but I really enjoyed Mr. Lucky's Diner.    Pink Taco was okay \/ nothing to rave about.

Who didn't want to be a rock star for just a little bit? 

Party like a Rock star at the Hard Rock!!   Here for a bachelor party, we had one of the most amazing suites I've been in.   ( I shant give away the secret location.. so don't ask) 

I won't go into the pool, or views, or anything like that because if you can't imagine a vegas pool (ie Rehab)... you should either book your flight today or join a convent.   

The VIP staff and hosts were simply amazing.   Mike F.  and Trehy really hooked us up when going to the club.  Six bottles and an entire corner to ourselves later - we had an amazing night.   I truly have to give it to our waitress, Rachel, for what became one of the most memorable nights ever.   I would never go here again if I wasn't able to have her to hang out with.  (She was genuine, funny and beautiful)   

The actually ""casino"" is a bit small, but what do I care - I only play craps.   

Although there was no Buffett at the hotel, they did have an ""all you can eat"" tapas restaurant which wasn't bad.   

Pink taco - the mexican place - was really really good!!!   Although the computer went down, the waitress forced us to go to the ATM - PAY THE FEE - so that we had to pay her in cash.....  Which was complete BS. 

But you're in vegas, and several ... (several)....  thousand dollars later - this was by far the best vegas trip I have ever had.   - and i have been there more than a dozen times.",1,0,0

We booked and paid via Booking.com and on arrival we found surprised to pay extra for ""service use"" and of course tax, which increased the price by half of what we had already canceled. Furthermore on arrival there were no available rooms with king size bed and got a room with two beds. Yes, on our honeymoon ... Not good. Against this, the desk person was not kind to us to tell our displeasure.

Upon reaching our room I found a dirty bathroom and very bad toiletries. The truth is that being a Hard Rock thought the experience would be quite different.

After going down to the bar, the bartender was not all cocktails available as we had said. And he was angry with us because we commented that!!

Finally, the location is quite far to walk around, so you should always add outputs by taxi between $ 25 to $ 60USD.

I stopped at the Hard Rock today to have breakfast at the Pink Taco.  I parked in the new garage and I saw how the casino was expanded when the new tower and garage were added.  It's not the small, circular casino it once was.

It was also a weird experience as the employee's are in a pit below you and you have to bend over to a 3 foot table to sign forms and whatever.

Rooms in the Paradise tower are very cool looking and appear clean, but upon inspection there is dust EVERYWHERE.. I ran my finger across a picture frame for 12 inches and pulled off a 1\/2 inch thick wad of dust.

The biggest gripe I have is that the largely consists of local turds, jersey shore posers and rocker wanna-be's.. Luckily most of them hang out at Pink taco, but a much lower end experience than what you would get on the strip.

Back to the rooms, the cleaning \/ catering staff (in room) is severely challenged. When I got to the room, i noticed the mini bar was only half provisioned and the tray that electrically holds cookies and nuts was missing over half the entries.... I thought they may have just run out.... Nope, next morning, on TV bill, I not only had an entry for a movie (3 total, i watched 2) I didn't watch but a bill for 3 food items...

WTF.. I called to the desk below and complained, and they were emphatic this gets restocked every day... I called bullshit but they didn't care..

And lastly, unless I saw this with my own eyes I would have called bullshit. My buddy was checking into his room.. The door opens, and what does he see, a woman on her knees (on the floor) getting banged by a dude... These are electric keys so it couldn't have been the wrong room but obviously the top of the house isn't talking to the bottom....

I would have liked to return here for a concert but honestly, Mandalay is much better.

As far as the other yelpers complaining about the distance from the casino to the tower, all I can say is you need to get out and walk more in your everyday life! Sheesh, you must not get any exercise, because it only takes a couple of minutes! 

As others have noted, the room was a bit dark, but not a problem. Don't lift any of the provided food items or you will be charged whether you eat them or not!

The customer service was great and the younger, rocker crowd was a nice change from the other places I've stayed which are on the strip. Restaurant were all good, but of course, over priced. They have a shuttle that takes you to the strip, but we just used a taxi since we didn't want to wait. Only $10 (including tip) to get to the middle of the strip or airport.

Part of it being a good deal, however, was the fact that we were arriving at 11 PM on Sunday night. Since it was pretty late, I guess, when we were checking in we received the disappointing news that there were some big groups staying, and there were no King rooms available. We had originally booked a Mountain View King room in the Casino Tower, so it was kind of a bummer that there weren't ANY king rooms available. However, I guess it was kind of understandable since we checked in late. I attempted to use the $20 trick when checking in and asked for an upgrade. The woman helping us slipped the tip back to me, but did ""upgrade"" us to a Pool View Queen room in the newer Paradise Tower. She was really apologetic about there not being any king rooms available, and advised us to check in the next morning to see if any would be available.

Our first room was nice, however, it was on the 3rd floor so even though it was a Pool View, there wasn't too much of a great view. It wasn't anything terrible like a view of the parking lot, but was just too low to get the real experience. The next morning, after breakfast, we checked at the front desk if any king rooms were open, and were moved to a great Pool View King room on the 17th floor of the Paradise Tower for the rest of our stay. The view of the pool was great and allowed us to scout out the crowd before we ventured down there and we were really happy with the room.

As far as the casino itself, we didn't do TOO much gambling there. It's pretty small compared to other casinos. I lost money on the slots, and my boyfriend lost money playing blackjack. However, I ended up making some money playing roulette and betting on sports, and since I'm new to gambling, I really appreciated that the dealers were patient and helpful. 

The only on site restaurant we ate at was Mr. Lucky's, and it was out of convenience. The first night I got the mac and cheese which was a little too intense (covered in crushed Cheez-Its) and my boyfriend got the reuben sandwich, which he liked just fine. We went back to breakfast another morning (after seeing Ke$ha at PURE,) totally riding the struggle bus, and had a decent hangover meal of pepperoni flatbread and some kind of egg dish for my bf that I can't recall.

In-N-Out Burger is about a 15-20 minute walk away, through the UNLV campus. Starbucks was a 15 minute walk down the road. Even closer, there are two plazas across the street from the Hard Rock which we frequently visited. Just making the 2 minute walk across the street for alcohol ($1 24oz beers at the liquor store across the street) and food (Paradise Cantina, Subway, Johnny Rockets) saved us a TON of money and allowed us to splurge on other things. To save on the crazy ATM fees in Vegas, we got cash back at CVS across the street whenever we stopped there for water, Red Bull, and other little things.

Vegas is expensive, and since the Hard Rock is off the strip, be prepared to spend on cabs. We paid $10-15 each way to the strip. Beware of the $3 fee that gets tacked on if you pay for your fare with a card. The Hard Rock does has a shuttle that goes to the strip, but it only runs from 10AM - 5PM so the way our plans worked out, we only ended up using it once. A trip to Fremont Street was $25 each way, which was shocking, but I made a good amount of money gambling there so thankfully the fare ended up getting covered.

We spent a fair amount of time at the pool this past week, since the weather was in the 80s. They were preparing most of the pools for the official open, but the Nirvana and Breathe pools were open while we were there. Getting there by noon got us chairs, or even better one day, a day bed. I don't know if they will start charging for the cabanas \/ day beds \/ chairs since pool season has officially started, but everything was first come first serve and free when we got there. We had no problem bringing our own drinks. The water in the Nirvana pool was cold, so there wasn't a whole bunch of swimming going on, but it was perfect for taking a dip in when we wanted to cool off from the heat.

All in all, I really enjoyed the Hard Rock! We found the staff to be really helpful, and I would love to come back again to check out Rehab this summer.",2,0,0

I purchased 13 rooms & The Real World Suite for 3 nights.  There is no excuse for how I was treated.  Security followed me around on the premises for over an hour until I was finally able to check out completely & remove over 30 guests from all of their rooms.  This is no way to treat any guest staying at your hotel, especially one spending over 15k on rooms alone. I feel extremely disrespected and I do not like the way I was treated. I wasn't able to speak to management whatsoever to resolve the matter at hand.  I will never recommend or bring anyone in to this establishment ever again.  We also had items stolen out of our suite, 1 laptop, 1 iPad, music Equpment, 2 microphones, a couple backpacks.  But what  bothers me the most is their primary concern was not retrieving the items or catching the people who did this.  Their primary concern was getting me off the property which included over 30 of my guests.  We came to Vegas this weekend to work, not to party.  The way I was treated is completely uncalled for.",1,1,0

Out of 8 rooms, none of the AC units were working. Every time we were in the room, there was a mechanic right there with us working on our AC. It got so bad some of us changed rooms...and ran into the same problem. Awesome for July in Vegas.

Saturday we rented a cabana and that was the worst mistake we made all weekend. Kimberly, our waitress, acted like she had never worked as a waitress before and I wouldn't be surprised if she hadn't. Every drink order took at least 45 min to an hour. Whenever we needed something we had to chase her or some other server down. Several of us finally set up tabs at the bar and got it ourselves. Having Kimberly was completely pointless. I finally complained about her a few times and she still didn't get any better. It was without a doubt the WORST SERVICE I've ever gotten. 

****The highlight of this terrible experience was when we were closing our tab. It was well over $1200 so we paid $500 in cash and put the rest on our room. Well...hours later the whole tab shows up on the room bill. When we called the pool, they said ""Kimberly said you never gave her cash"". Exsqueeze me? Hard Rock was adamant that we never gave her cash and called us liars. When we informed them that 15 people were standing around and witnessed us giving little Kimberly the $500...they mysteriously changed their story. ""Oh Kimberly said the computers were down so she couldn't put it in the system and she just forgot about it"". Right. What a corrupt scheme! Needless to say we canceled the cabana for Sunday.

My iphone also went missing. When I called the Lost & Found, they asked where I lost it. What? That's how they categorize their system- by area. Well if I knew, I wouldn't be calling the Lost & Found now would I? I told Brayane that it was a black iphone 4. He told me there were no iphones in the entire system. So you're telling me out of all the 1000s of people that go in and out of the casinos, hotel, pools, restaurants, lobby, venue, gift shops, etc...that you don't even have 1 iphone? I'm not criticizing them for my phone. It was my fault for losing it. But the whole thing was shady and everyone acted like it wasn't their problem. 

Not only will I NEVER stay here again...I f%$@#&! hate this place.

I came for a short chill break with my two little boys and am meeting up with a gal pal and her two boys. Just wanted to enjoy the sun and lay by the pool.  We drove in from LA early this morning to miss traffic and got here at 10am so I knew we'd be sitting by the pool waiting for our room. They said they'd text me when our room is ready.  At 2:30pm I walked back to registration and asked about my room. ""Oh, check in is from 3-5pm."" So, I reluctantly walked back to the pool to wait for our text. 4:45pm still no text. 
So I take my very tired sun kissed little boys back to check in and you guessed it, room still not reacts AT 4:45pm!!!?!?? Wth!? 
I tell the registration chick (& I say that nicely because she was obviously irritated that I was asking about my room, that she said would be ready between 3-5pm. So I asked her if I waited another 15 minutes of my room would be ready and she said that she couldn't guarantee it.

HR is smaller then the monsters on the strip but that is not to say that it has an intimate feel to it.  It was very crowded on a weekend night.  Apparently the crazies who decided to avoid the strip decided to show up here.

There's the Hard Rock restaurant just across the parking lots from the front doors of the hotel.  The Monster mini golf, CVS, and other restaurants are close across the streets.

For shopping, there's John Varvatos and Affliction stores.  The pool area is nice with a slide and deep water.  The airplanes often flying near this hotel and our friends told us it can be heard in the room but not in the night.

Our room was slightly updated but felt like a run of the mill motel room with a few aesthetic changes. Our ""view"" was a rooftop and ventilation ducts.

The next morning I call Orbit to complaint that the actual room does not look like the pictures posted on the website which I felt i was being mislead as a customer. Orbit was kind enough to call the hotel and Hard Rock was kind enough to upgrade us  to a suite with a view on the 15 floor in their new tower (HRH tower) with an additional $50\/night.

We enjoy our next three nights stay in the suite. It was spacious, well appoint, with comfortable sofa and bed. Great soaking bathtub. So if you are booking your vaca here I would not go for the standard room, upgrade yourself to the suite, it is worth every penny. 

water and snack is expansive like every hotels on the strip. If you choose to stay here, right behind Hard Rock is a CVS where you can save some money to buy water and snack. There also a lot other good food with great prices around the hotel. 

The only downside is that the hotel is a bit far from the strip. they do provide free shuttle to the strip from 10am to 5pm. Our main transportation from the hotel to the strip daily was Uber, which is about $5-$7 \/ ride depending on where in the strip you are going. 

There are three pool area. one of them only opens on the weekend. The other two are available all week long but one of them is a bit noisy if you are looking for a quiet afternoon by the pool since it will have loud rock\/soft rock music playing all day and it is a bit more crowded than the quiet pool. The quiet pool area is nice and relaxing but if you dont get yourself there early then dont even bother because you will never get a chair or day bed.

Upon check in they say none are available only two queens and smoking room. They did not even try to accommodate us. I come to Vegas maybe around 5 times a year and this is the first time a hotel has not met my needs. At other hotels they will do their best to give you what u want. I guess hard rock wants you unsatisfied unless you pay more for an upgrade that at other hotels they will just do for free to make sure their customers are happy. Then we had an incident in the pool I came on vacation with my sister and her girlfriend and they discriminated against them for kissing in the pool. The security guard got aggressive and told them twice to stop kissing but he did not tell that to the straight couples who were also doing the same thing.

So other than that we would rate it 5 stars. 

We loved the Rock History memorabilia displays throughout the hotel, my personal favorite was Paul McCartney's Bass and it was right by the elevators. 

Pink Taco was good, not the best Mexican Restaurant ever but still good, I tried the pink tacos and they were really delish, my wife's enchiladas however were not the greatest. 

Fuel Coffee shop... If there's a Starbucks around go there first, make this place your last resort. How do you screw up a caramel macchiato? And a medium black coffee was $3.75! Starbucks is only 2 bucks for regular black coffee. Oh well but  the donuts were Bomb!

I ate at Pink Taco the first night. Friendly service. However extremely slow. I sat at the table for 10 minuted before anybody came to take my drink order. Once they did, I place my food order as well. My food came extremely fast. In fact, I didn't get my drink, an Arnold Palmer, until I was halfway through eating my meal. I was never offered a refill nor did I get any chips and salsa. And, again, it took a very long time to get my check and pay. I had dinner around 8 pm.",0,0,0

It's not on the strip but still offers uninterrupted views of scantily clad waitresses, bouncers to keep you from ""exclusive"" pool parties, loud sex noises well into 6 am, sticky carpets, and the fresh smokey scent all pregnant women have come to enjoy.

The Hard Rock is definitely newly updated and rockin'. I can't speak to the other toweres this being my first stay but I was impressed. We stayed in the Paradise Tower which is the farthest from the lobby, BUT the closest to the Rideshare pickup (inside the Paradise parking garage). The room was REALLY nice, iHome with bluetooth, beautiful floor to ceiling windows overlooking east Las Vegas, nice decor. 

There is a free shuttle that drops off Fashion Show, we did not utilize but would have if we were staying longer. 

We also go super lucky because we arrived at 11:30 am praying to be able to check in early, unfortunately nothing available that early but the bellman held our bags and we went to eat. The front desk staff took my cell # down and I received a text when we were done with lunch (perfect timing!) that our room was ready! At 12:30 :)",6,4,7

Since it was paid for by my company, I didn't have a choice. I probably would not have choose to stay at this hotel on my own as it is far from the strip and pricey for what you get.

We had a corner room in the Paradise Tower facing the strip. It was a far walk from the elevator but the view at night was spectacular. The room was nice...decor was posh and gothic at the same time, reminded me of a Hot Topic store. Walked through the pool area but didn't go in. The pool looked shallow, purposed more for spring break rendezvous\/drinking\/partying\/to see and be seen --The pool area even had a bar and swim up black jack tables (If you're into that kind of scene, just seems kinda douchey to me but that's just my opinion). We ate breakfast at the 24 hour diner Mr. Lucky's 24-7 and it was excellent relative to other hotel diners.

I stayed at the Hard Rock over the weekend for my sister's bachelorette party shenanigans and I walked away feeling disappointed and angry. Not only is the hotel\/casino depressing, the employees are so rude! Below are a few examples of the employees having bad attitudes:

1. The hotel has a new policy that bell hops are not allowed to bring food or beverages up to the room for you. That's lame but whatever. The bell hop we had was very matter of fact about it and unapologetic. He acted annoyed and he was a total jerk when we pressed him for more information about it.

2. We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and requested the rooms be near each other if not right next to each other. When we checked in we asked to make sure they were near each other and they were not. They were on complete opposite sides of the tower. When we asked if we could have them next to each other the gentleman at the check-in desk said it was really busy and they were still trying to get rooms together. We said that was ok and we could wait until 2 rooms next to each other were ready and he said ""Well it could be 1 hour or it could be 5 hours. I have no idea so I don't know what to tell you."" SO UNHELPFUL and not very accommodating at all.

3.. Our friend called down to the bell desk to ask for her luggage and they said they weren't very busy so it would only be about 15 minutes.. It was clearly taking longer to she called down to check on it. My friend: ""Hi I'd like to follow up on my luggage. It's been about 30 minutes since I called down and you said it would be up in 15 minutes."" Bell desk: ""Actually it's only been 27 minutes! We're very busy so you're going to have to wait!"" uuhhh.....what?

4. We were getting ready to go out for the night and the bride-to-be wanted to grab a quick appetizer before we started to drink a lot so we went into Pink Taco. There were about 9 of us girl and we decided that rather than get a table we would just sit at the bar. The bar only had about 3 other people at it so there was plenty of room for us. Only a few of us were going to be eating and the rest of the girls wanted to get a drink while we waited for them. When the 4 girls who were going to eat asked for a menu at the bar the bar tender looked at the other bartender, rolled his eyes and said ""what the hell is this!"" and walked away...leaving the other bartender to help us. We were all ordering drinks...we were all paying customers...I'm so confused as to why the bar tender was annoyed that a few of the girls wanted to eat.  Then one of the girls needed a paper napkin so she asked the bartender if she could get a few napkins.  He looked at her with eyes of disgust, picked up the linen napkin that was in front of her, and proceeded to dangle it in front of her face like she was an idiot and didn't know it was there. When she actually just needed a paper napkin so that's why she asked for one.

5. We went into The Ainsworth, which is a little lounge type bar inside the casino. One of my friends ordered a drink from the bar and the total was $7.00. She gave the bartender a $20 bill and the bartender only gave her $8.00 back. The money was sitting on the bar and before she even reached to put it away she told the bartender ""Oh, I think you forgot to the other $5.00"" since the change was supposed to be $13.00.  The bartender said ""Oh really?!?!"" in a very condescending tone and then said ""Let's check the cameras then!"" My friend was absolutely dumbfounded. The guy standing next to her backed up her claim, that she was given the wrong change. But the bartender denied it. When my friend asked for a manager and tried to explain what happened and let him know the bartender was treating her unfairly, he refused to help her at all. He did end up giving her the $5.00 she was owed, but only after 15 minutes of arguing about it.

I do have to mention, though, that the maid we had was the nicest person on the planet and we loved her. We also had a positive experience in the center bar...the cocktail waitress there was really sweet.",5,3,3

We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. 

Check-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. 

There are signs all over the casino and hotel that says ""no outside food or beverage allowed"" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. 

The rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. 

Also, the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to stay here. It is not on the strip and it's a further walk from it than you would expect. If you stay here but want to go to other casinos, you better take a cab or have a car. 

The only positives about this hotel is the decor and the Joint. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from Hard Rock - modern with a punk influence and the Joint was awesome! A great intimate venue (but the drinks are extremely overpriced - $7 for a very small cheap beer like shocktop - you could buy a whole 6-pack at the CVS across the street for that much!)

Basically, just don't stay here unless you're looking to party hard in your hotel and piss everyone on your floor off. The staff doesn't do anything about parties and loud music in the suites. I've had a few friends get suites just to throw parties and you can hear the music all the way down the hall, but staff never said a word to them. They obviously don't care about the customers in suites that are actually trying to get some rest at 3 in the morning.",5,0,0

2.When we checked out we were charged $15 a night for spa entry and shuttle to the strip. Oh really? I dont remember receiving any of those services.

The people at the front desk were extremely rude and aloof, the types that act like they're better than you. Then they couldn't figure out how much we were supposed to be charged. And it was the BIGGEST deal that we wanted to put the room charge on a different credit card from the one we booked with, but they couldn't do it. Well they sort of could, because they charged both credit cards. Then when I called to complain they told me that I WAS WRONG and had to have my credit card company dispute this. Furthermore, in the whole of the hotel they claimed they didn't have a room with a king bed. So my husband and I had a romantic weekend in separate beds. THANKS HARD ROCK! 

The only thing that wasn't a total disgusting vile nightmare was room service. They were respectful, gave me what I ordered, polite and efficient. If I could stay at a hotel just based on room service then I'd still stay at the HRH. 

To top it all off, I went to one bar for a drink, was the only person at the bar, was completely ignored for 10 minutes. Went to another bar, got a check that my drink was $5, paid with a $10 and then got $1 change and a new bill in with it. Disgraceful.",1,0,0

I planned my buddy's bachelor party here, but regretted it. We booked two x two queen suites for a party of 7 guys for Friday and Saturday night. The reason why I chose this place was because of the trendy location, the nightclub, and ReHab pool party. I was thoroughly disappointed for a couple reasons.

1. Nightclub - I made reservations here back in January. I called to ask about getting in the nightclub and if there were special promotions for hotel guests. I was told that the nightclub was free before 11:00 pm. I called again in June with a new promotion code for the rooms and checked again to see if there were any changes to the nightclub policies. Again, I was told it's free before 11:00 pm. On the day of check in, I asked front desk whether I needed to be on a guest list or do I just show up. Once more, I was told to show up at 11:00 pm. We pre-partied in our room and headed downstairs at 10:30 pm. It turns out, the nightclub was closed and had been closed for a while. 

2. Service - I brought this up to the manager and asked how this could have happened? Why would reservation not tell me that the nightclub was closed and why did front desk tell me to show up by 11:00 pm and act like the nightclub was open for the evening. The manager apologized and offered to waive the resort fee and give us a $50 dollar food credit. That's barely enough for taxi ride to another club, let alone, having to pay 50\/person for cover at another club. It really messed up our plans. Unfortunately, we didn't even get to use the food credit. I was planning on using it at the restaurants the following morning, but when I was credited, it was supposed to be used by end of the night. 

3. Rehab - Very dead. They closed off the waterslide for liability reasons and the pool party was not very crowded. Everything about this place was overpriced and expensive, but that's Vegas right?

4. Casino Renovations - Not sure why Hard Rock would want to renovate during the busiest travel season, but more than 70% of the casino floor was under construction. There was a handful of tables and barely anyone one gambling. 

5. Cleanliness of room - For the most part the rooms were clean, but the couch was absolutely fifthly. I sat on and pulled out used silverware between the cushions. 

Here's what did go right: 

1. Room - The room was spacious. We liked how there are audio inputs and speakers provided in the room. 

2. Front desk really worked hard on keeping the two rooms together. Since we checked in early, they were able to give us one room and clean another one 2 doors down. 

I used to gamble and hang out here a lot, but this place has gone down hill. Overall, the reservations and nightclub situation left a bad taste in my mouth. It really messed up my groups plans and to just waive the resort fees was a slap in the face. Not that I didn't appreciate it, but the attitude from the staff was ""well, that's too bad. we'll waive the resort fee and that's all we will do. take it or leave it."".

Had a room on the 12th floor with a pool view. Room was clean, had semi balcony doors opening to the pool view, and a super comfy bed. Bathroom was smallish compared to HRH tower. Ate at Pink Taco and Mr luckys..
Both were good and I would go back. The casino experience was completely underwhelming though.
I had taken several casino markers and after knowing I was back to even, colored up and wanted to buy the markers back. The dealer colored me up incorrectly on two different occasions, saying I was a few hundred short. Since I knew what I had, I asked for a surveillance review and after 40 mins of waiting, was colored up correctly and bought the markers back. It's not professional when a dealer cannot properly count chips, and you have to waste nearly 2 hours collectively waiting. Very poor service in the casino..",2,0,2

It's so sad that they cannot have cameras in the hallway and put any effort in to try and catch these people.

Just going for a overall score at the end.

Food ****

We tried the lucky, pizza place and the HRC next door. All really good places, great service and plenty to choose from. Bit expensive at HRC so not 5*
But inside the hotell the prices are good.

Check inn *

We used booking.com and wanted 2 things only. 2 beds and an earlie check inn.
Both failed.
We had to wait 2 hours for a room with one bed. Or 3 hours for a room with 2 beds. Of course we waited 3 hours. 

The room*****

Really cool room. And maby the best beds in the world. Loud music at the morning, but that we cant blame the hotell for. It is Vegas :-D
The view was also the best in vegas so far.

Cleaning *****

Clean room, and new towels each day. The maids even speaks english.

Other **

Internett sucks. You can upgrade for 8 dollars a day, but this is 2016, and a minimum of 10mp should always be included.
Tv Chanels was good, but the tv was old. To dark and the sound was terrible.
Only way to keep your beer cold, is a bucket and some ice. There is no minibar. Only pay and open.

Overall.

Great hotell, i will defently stay here again. But i wil bring my own travel router ;-)",0,0,0

I felt so bad for the rest of the band who tried to hold the concert together. I said that Wes Scantlin is pathetic and he singled me out and told us to leave.

We scored a room for what I thought was a bargain until check in when I learned that an $25.00 per day would be added for a ""resort fee"". At the desk, I specifically asked if that would include our use of the spa and was assured that it would. Upon using the spa, which is decadent, I learned that there was an additional $25.00 fee for day-use of the spa. 

Gaming area is small and SMOKY. Of course one expects cigarette smoke when in Vegas but the small space made it ridiculous. To their credit, the pit crew was helpful most of the time. 

Please stay here if these things don't matter to you and you do not intend to stay in your room other than to sleep. 

Upon arrival we ate at the PINK TACO restaurant; my chicken tostada salad was flavorless; almost like eating cyber-food if such a thing existed. Perhaps soylent green; I don't know.  Refreshingly, their signature $7.77 steak dinner was VERY good. 

Valet is free, with the exception of the standard tip, and well organized. We never had to wait long to retrieve our car. 

Wi-Fi is free!!!! (if you can get a connection, which I could not...)

Overall, I found the attitude of the staff in-conducive to my return. Will find a better deal elsewhere.

This was my first (and last) stay at HRH.  I have never stayed at a hotel with such poor customer service before this trip - even Imperial Palace was better!!  That's saying a lot...  This review is regarding a stay the weekend of October 6, 2012.

FRONT DESK:
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E!!  The main reason we stayed at HRH was because guests get into Rehab pool party for free and it was one of the last parties of the season.  We called reservations and the front desk before booking the room to confirm that this is true.  So, once we arrived it's only natural to follow up at check-in to see if we would receive some type of pass to indicate that we get free entry... Sally Stick-up-her-A** said ""you don't get in for free, you have to pay"".  I promptly replied that I spoke with several representatives of the hotel before arriving and they stated otherwise.  She told us that because we were checking out on Sunday we weren't considered to be guests on that date and therefore aren't eligible to get in to Rehab for free.. And she specifically said ""sorry doll, I don't know what to tell you"".  

Ummm, no honey boo boo.. Rehab opens at 10am and check out isn't until 11am.  Our luggage can be held at bell desk without any problems and we're given a claim ticket for it.  I'm technically a ""guest"" until I check out of my room, which means I have time to go downstairs at 10am, get my free wristband& check out.  If someone would have told us over the phone what this sister-wife did I would have booked a hotel somewhere else and saved the resort fee.  Anywhoo... When I got to the room I called the organizers of Rehab pool party and they graciously put myself and my friends on a free guestlist so we avoided having to pay $30 each.

ROOMS:
Casino Tower Pool View - not a good value for the price.   We only stayed for one night but as soon as we arrived there were problems.  The room felt smaller than expected and the bathroom definitely couldn't accommodate four girls.   We called the front desk and asked if it was possible to pay for an upgrade to a larger room and we were told that there were no upgrades available.  BLAHH.  And then, after looking around the room we noticed that it wasn't clean.. 

**There were moths squished\/killed on the room walls, live moths flying around, holes in the pillow cases, visible hand prints on the velvet headboards in suggestive positions (EWW), hair in the bathtub and on the sink and floor of the bathroom, rust stains on the floor where water was dripping from the bathroom sink, and after turning on a hot shower the mirror fogged up to show markings indicating that it was not clean as well. We again called the front desk to see if we could possibly switch rooms (same type of room - not an upgrade) so that we can be in a clean environment since we just got to Vegas and wanted to relax. Yet another representative said they could not move us to a different room - even though the room we were in should have been cleaned before we arrived.  Nastiness.. AGAIN, the customer service here is bullshit. 

REHAB:
I've been to Rehab 3 times and this last time was a more relaxed experience.  DJ Pauly D was there and the vibe was fun, even though there was barely anyone at the party all day.  The massive crowds of people filling the pools and cabanas weren't there (the group was about 1\/5 of that size).  I liked the fact that there was plenty of available shaded space to sit and relax if we wanted when we weren't in the pool.  If it were the middle of the summer, this wouldn't be the case.  Normally, you are at the mercy of the burning hot sun and need to claim some space in the murky water (this means holding your money in your bikini top and if you have a debit\/credit card you NEED to carry ID with you as well - good luck holding onto that for 6 hours after a few drinks).  Food is reasonably priced but the branded Rehab cups are a rip off for $27-$29.  The bartenders fill the 24oz cup with ice and pour 3oz of liquor at the bottom then fill it to the top with a mixer... come on son... My advice is pre-game before you go.

CABANAS @ REHAB:
*Guys - These are a great idea if you have a large group and plan on staying all day.  Just don't book it directly on the website.  Find a promoter who has a hook up at Rehab and it will save you 1\/2 price.  The total can be used towards alcohol, food, water, etc.  Comfy seating with fans, a TV, and safe - TWO THUMBS UP!
*Girls - Same deal, if you actually plan on paying for it.  However 9 times out of 10 you'll end up walking around the pool and will get invited to a cabana and drink for free in the shade.  The only other shade is in the bathroom area and by the covered bar which is SUPER crowded with nowhere to sit.  Day beds are a waste of $ unless you're super pale and want skin cancer",5,0,0

Very little actually remains from my first trip: Mr. Lucky's, the Joint, maybe Pink Taco and the famous center bar.  Otherwise, HRH, as they like to be called now, is constantly being shaped and molded into what is hip and trendy at the moment.  This year they're adding 2 new towers and a new casino.  This trip I stayed in the new Paradise Tower.  The other new tower and casino open in just days.  That's just another reason to book another trip soon.

We stayed in a beautiful corner room in the new Paradise Tower.  Compared to the older rooms, you gain floor to ceiling windows but lose the French balcony.  Don't touch the mini-bar items.  Bring your own.  For a tip, they'll bring a fridge which was great.  (Las Vegas survives on tips.  It's no different here.  We saved a ton on covers and room upgrades simply by tipping well.)

People either love or hate the HRH.  If you don't want a rock 'n' roll crowd, go stay at the Tropicana and see Wayne Newton.  It also makes a difference when you visit.  HRH can either be a great bargain or horribly expensive.  Do some research.  Rehab Sundays make this one of the more expensive places to stay during the blazing (and usually less expensive) summer.  There is a new convention center on site so mid-week visits can be dominated by huge groups of conventioneers.  

Another suggestion if staying at the HRH, there is a small strip mall of only restaurants across Paradise from HRH.  I've eaten at all of them.  They are all good and cheaper than the HRH restaurants.  Joe's New York Pizza is a must have every time I visit.  We also enjoyed the lunch specials at Origin India on this trip.

A great many casinos around Vegas are changing their odds on blackjack.  Read the rules before sitting down at a table.  Boycott any table that doesn't pay 3-2 on blackjack.  There are still 3-2 tables at HRH.  Many of the strip casinos don't.  The tables that pay 6-5 or even 1-1 on blackjack are simply stealing your money.  Don't be dumb with your $$$.  That's it for my soapbox.  Rock out!!!",1,0,2

The rooms are clean, and there's plenty of overpriced impulse items available to use in compromising situations (everything from a $20 Marvin Gay CD to $9 spray water). 

Our hall reeked like marijuana, which is always a good sign, because it means that supervision is low. One guy at the party passed out face down in the middle of the hallway for about a half hour unnoticed before we noticed him and dragged him in a room ... a testament to my point.

The best part about the gambling room is the center bar. Not only does it serve $2 beers during happy hour, but it generally attracts the floor's best looking women. 

Although I won my largest wager at the Hard Rock sportsbook, I think it's way too small to able to comfortably watch a game. I would recommend watching it in a cabana if it's an early game or going to Palms, which I probably think is sweet because that's where I saw the Lakers cover the spread which clinched the parley with 0:46 left in the 4th.

By far, the best feature of the hotel is the pool. Despite the fact that it's $20 just to get in, and that's even when you are paying for a room there, it has a great tropical layout with all that you would want in a Vegas pool. All the waitresses are soon to be or ex strippers, which only adds to the scenery (see what I did there with that play on words). Plus, the DJ in the back end of the pool can spin like he has a gun to his head. DJ remixed South Park with Kanye (mike dropped).

Personally I must shower after any road trip. This time I also needed to take a short power nap before stepping out on the town. The girl that checked us in was very pleasant and even upgraded our room for us. 

We had to get by a guard named Rodney at the hotel entrance. We showed him our keys and he ushered us in. He started offering suggestions about where to go and even offered to call ahead to put us on the guest list (add a star for that!).  We declined and told him that we would stop by later after we changed.

Got into the room and were surprised with some of the amenities. The bed was plush and very comfortable. Next to the bed was an adapter to plug our i-phone into so we could listen to music. The shower was huge with glass doors. We had a beautiful view and bathrobes were hung neatly in the wardrobe closet. I loved the colour scheme that was used, more of the dark black and greys. 

Granted we didn't spend much time in the room but it was clean, and the staff was great. My friend surprised me by ordering breakfast to be delivered in the morning and it arrived right on time. He said that they had a pretty good menu but for me it's all about coffee first thing in the morning. 

I read some of the other reviews about the hotel being off the strip but it was a nice place. Most of the people that were downstairs gambling were guests at the hotel. The atmosphere isn't as crazy as some of the other places located on the strip so it was a good change.",1,0,1

As a BIG fan of music, I was excited to hit this place up. I walked in and my eyes widened at the sight of Sex Pistols memorabilia and I spent a great deal of time walking the entire floor to look at all of the goodies. Unfortunately my excitement was short lived... 

My friend and I sat down at some slot machines. We were carded immediately which is ok. It happens. However, this happened every single 5 minutes. I am not exaggerating. I was carded by the same woman 3 times! I moved to a different area and was again carded by two other guys working the floor. I made a comment to the guy carding me and said wow man every 5 minutes I'm going to be carded, really? And he laughed at me and said I highly doubt that. Had a very poor attitude. Please let me add in that I was here on a weekday and the casino floor was EMPTY. The bars were empty and there were a few scattered people throughout. I wasn't lost in a crowd where they had to continuously card me. There was nobody there! Their poor attitudes and eventual HARASSMENT, drove me out of the place. Yes I use the word harassment because that's exactly what it was! I left very unhappy and I will NEVER return to this place again. What a disappointment.",3,0,1

::::: [ THE ROOMS AT THE HRH TOWER - 4.5\/5 ] :::::

Aside from the very first time I visited the Hard Rock, I've been staying at the HRH Tower - twice at the KING SUITE, and once at the SUPREME CORNER KING SUITE. 

Both are beautiful rooms, complete with a separate living and sleeping area, split up by a divider that has a 40"" LCD TV mounted on each side. The interior is contemporary with light colors and shades of beige, ivory, gray, and natural tones. In the bedroom, there's also a touch screen jukebox with an iPod dock. Too bad it's not compatible with Spotify. :-\/ Another bonus is the blackout drapes.. which for me means better sleep. The bathroom is spacious, with a deep tub and a separate shower.

This hotel is off the strip, so it really wouldn't make sense to stay there unless you have a car. They do have a shuttle service, but it's really not the most reliable thing.


::::: [ THE POOL - 4\/5 ] :::::

The pool here is pretty epic. If you're staying here, you really should take a moment to check it out at least once. Of course, it's more of a place to generally relax and\/or socialize than to ""swim.""

The Hard Rock Hotel in Bali also has a pool with sand in it, but it's minuscule in comparison.


::::: [ THE CASINO - 3\/5 ] :::::

The casino is just okay. The payouts at the tables aren't great, and the machines are pretty standard. 

Still, staying at the hotel does mean I usually end up playing at least 15mins or so per day at the casino... especially since the hubby sleeps a whole lot more than I do.


::::: [ THE RESTAURANTS - 3.5\/5 ] :::::

               * NOBU: I haven't been to this specific NOBU, but I've found that all of the Nobu branches tend to be pretty reliable and consistently high in terms of quality. I do recommend making reservations ahead of time if you plan to dine here.
               * PINK TACO: Haven't tried it, so I can't tell you if all the attention this place gets is based on hype, price, convenience, or if they really do serve great food.
               * MR LUCKY'S: The food is pretty mediocre. It's open 24\/7 so it may prove to be a convenient stop sometimes. For those of you who love a bargain, they offer a ""Gambler's Special"" for $7.77 that includes a salad, an 8oz sirloin, 3 jumbo shrimp, and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Do keep your expectations realistically low with regards to quality and flavor, though.

NOTE: If you're one of those people who like to check out the HARD ROCK CAFE at every city you visit (like my Dad), then keep in mind that the Hard Rock Cafe Las Vegas isn't actually located inside the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. It's on the strip.

The staff at the juice bar just outside the spa is snotty and expects people not to understand Spanish, criticizing customers. Parking is a bit of a mess if you are staying here. But there are excellent restaurants nearby, Gangnam and Firefly across the street. There's not much here besides music venues, conference rooms, pool parties, spa to nurse a hangover, 6-5 blackjack tables (boo), small poker room, and the 777 special at Mr. Lucky's diner.

My cousin is a veteran Vegas traveler so he strongly encouraged a stay at the Hard Rock, and I had absolutely no regrets. The hotel was built for one purpose: to party. If you're a 20- or 30-something looking to party, then get the hell off the strip and stay at the goddamn Hard Rock. Accommodations were simple, yet very comfortable. Great-smelling bath soap, shampoo. The decor is what you'd expect from the Hard Rock: dark, decadent, devilish.  Forget the MGM, NYNY, and all of those other kiddy hotels.

They said their systems were down. The wifi was also down and when I asked when it may be up, I was told they didn't know. 
The room is small, the literature in  the  room  about  events  and restaurant etc is out of date. Dissappointing. 
We went downstairs and spoke to HRH tower front desk this time. Explained our dissatisfaction. We got a credit back for the resort fee. I said that's the least they could do since we didn't have any wifi service for a good chunk of our stay and resort fees are for internet, pool towels, gym etc. Didn't use the pool or gym but did plan on keeping my kid entertained with her iPad. My husband then asked if they would be willing to give a discount to stay another night in the room type we reserved but night manager said no but that she could check to see if that room was available to switch to now. It was almost midnight. It was too late to switch. So we just accepted the resort fee credit and went back up to room 10415. The 2 stars were given because everyone working at HRH was friendly and polite, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to out of town friends or family.

What you don't know, up front, is that The Hard Rock charges a $100 dollar PER NIGHT deposit upon check in. I knew there was a service charge ($7.59 per night in addition to what I paid for the room) but I did not know they'd charge my credit card for $100 per night in addition to that. Why, you ask - because every other room on my floor was hosting a party!. 

Add to that the fact that they charge for use of the hotel gym - an additional $20 per day and the fact that there was construction going on behind the pool area, and the construction workers thought it was a good idea to drag trollys across the pool area and wake us up at 5 am. YES - 5 AM!!!! We had to open the balcony door and yell down after 20 minutes of continual noise.

Also, take caution when dining at Mr. Lucky's. The guy across from us vomited all over the floor just before our food arrived. Be prepared to deal with the over-zealous party people who can't hold their liquor. 

What we did like about the hotel (though we'll never stay there again) was - the bed was comfortable, the rooms were nice and the casino was well appointed. Eat at the Pink Taco if you get the chance, it's really good food.

Fortunately for me, I never grew up. [grin]

Here's why the Hard Rock is the hotel for 20-somethings:

1) THE POOL
""Jeezus Christ"":  Practice that phrase, boys, because once you hit the pool at opening @ 9AM, you're gonna be saying it a LOT as the ladies come out.  Welcome to the 8th wonder of the world, gentlemen.
... CHAIRS:  You'll need to get a beach chair - preferrably one on the sand if you get there early enough.  Break out the suntan lotion & the shades and get ready for the show. (Thr\/Fri is the best)  And bring slippers - the ground is hot.
(HINT:  $20 to a pool boy will reserve a beach chair for you the NEXT DAY between 10-11AM.)
... BLACKJACK:  At around 11:30PM, my favorite feature of the pool opens.  Swim-up Blackjack!  This is $25\/$500 3-2 6-deck, H17, DDany, Split 4.  It's an okay game and a place to have some fun.  Get a line of credit beforehand so you don't need to bring bills.
(HINT:  Women gravitate to this area like a moth to a flame.  I've seen some of the absolutely hottest ladies on the planet revolving around the 3 tables here, so keep your eyes peeled.  If you're winning, trust me - they'll notice.)
... REHAB:  On Sundays, a massively successful party is thrown called Rehab which provides the ladies from across the street at Club Paradise (a high end strip club) with free admission... so the eye candy is immediate from sun up.  If you're a hotel guest, you get free pass.  If not, you're screwed.

2) THE CASINO
The HRH Casino is one of the only major properties in Vegas that gets the majority of its casino revenues from table games and NOT slots.  This equates to HRH having bad table games with bad odds.  But they'll do it with a lot of eye candy wandering the floor and really great music playing in the background.  Somehow it doesn't hurt as much to lose a hand when ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" is playing.
... BLACKJACK:  They have a LOT of really awful $15\/$1000 single deck & double deck games because they all pay 6-5 on natural 21's. (For the uneducated, that's really BAD)  Stick to the $25\/$2000 3-2 6-deck shoes that they have out on the floor.  They have marginal rules but it's the best game in the casino.

3) THE RESTAURANTS
There are two restaurants worth worrying about:  
... PINK TACO:  It serves some of the most delicious chips & salsa, while providing a menu loaded in carbs to keep that youthful energy goin'... alongside a 'Patron' Margarita.  Incidentally, for those of you inexperienced with tequila, this is a good opportunity to broaden your horizons with various types of tequila like Tres Generacions, 3 Amigos Blanco, Herradura, Jimador, etc.
... NOBU:  Be sure to have reservations here if you intend on going.  No amount of grease will get you to the front of the reservation book.  Even a host may have trouble finding you a table on the fly so don't chance it.  See my review of Nobu for a better idea of what it's like.

4) THE JOINT
The Joint is a concert venue at HRH that plays host to some great concerts.  Everything from Breaking Benjamin & Linkin Park to David Spade & Jimmy Fallon.   Having the concert be in the hotel is awesomely convenient when good shows come up. 
... MR LUCKY'S:  And after the show you can drop into Mr. Lucky's for coffee or dessert!
(HINT:  There's 24\/7 off the menu special that isn't really a secret any more called the $7.77 special that's a real deal.  Instead of telling you, I'll let you order it to find out what is in it.)

5) THE ROCK SPA GYM
The HRH gym is the BIGGEST gym for guys in Vegas. 3 racks of free weights, over 6 benches, 3 shoulder presses, 3 crossovers, etc.  Really great set up - especially on the weekdays when no one's there.

FYI:  The rooms are old & Internet access is crap - get used to it.  You'll want a room that overlooks the pool... and it'll cost you close to $100\/day extra.  If you tip the front desk $20, they may bump you from a ""mountain view"" to a ""pool view"" at no charge.  Check http:\/\/www.frontdesktip.com\/fhotel.php?id=35 for success rates.  (And watch for the cross-promo products in your bathroom!  Hilarious!)

CONCLUSION:
This is the place to stay if you're under 30.  You'll need to bring your fittest body, your funniest pick up lines, and your tiniest bikini.  And don't forget that with the exception of Nobu, virtually anything is possible... with the right tip.

4-Stars.

REGARDING THE HARD ROCK ""HATERS"" ON YELP:
I don't understand the haters of HRH - especially the ""aging"" ones.  Are they so narcissistic that they can't see that this was once a helluva lot of fun for them and is still fun for a lot of young folk?  I would have thought that a little age & experience would have broadened their perspective a little.",10,7,7

First of all, the service here is great. Valet takes care of you and they really hussle and move to get you your vehicle. The check in process was actually very simple. During my visit, they made it easy to combine some vouchers from Living Social I had without making us move rooms or anything like that.

Our room was clean, it smelled great, and it came stocked with things we didn't even know, like the touch screen pads that control music and curtains. Overall, it was exciting to stay in a comfortable spot with an extremely comfortable bed!

The food downstairs is great. Nobu - wow. It was delicious although quite pricey. It doesn't hurt to have a good meal once in a while ;]

Mr. Lucky cafe is great too! Love their breakfast food.

During the day, the pool music can be loud, but honestly we loved it haha we opened our doors to hear it!!

We rented out a cabana for Friday. It was $500 for the day, and split between 15 or so people, that was pretty easy to accomplish. I loved it, but only splurged b\/c it was our wedding weekend. It was worth it to have drink\/food service and a safe place for our things.

There are times when room rates are available for under $50 a night due to lack of activity at their venues on those dates.

Slot machines are old and make it difficult to use your players card which they advertise extensively without giving you a chance to actually use it as the machines are so old you have manipulate them like an old Nintendo just to get it to work
Your resort fee and taxes equal nearly $29 per night; laughable as you all you get is wifi and their old fitness center access; for my two nights I essentially paid $40 plus tax just for wifi (i went to the fitness center at the spa instead of their old one).

Although they upgraded our room we just felt very uncomfortable for the rest of our stay and they didn't do much to accommodate our feelings. My best friends birthday trip was pretty much tarnished. So please be aware of this situation and the other bad reviews on this hotel before you decide to stay here.",1,0,0

The Hard Rock Hotel is small and boring. The casino is so little it's impossible to lose someone if you tried. There's no poker room, and only a handful of restaurants, one bar. Maybe some people like that, but considering that the pool is closed during the winter months, what else is there to do? It's also far enough off the strip that you can't simply walk outside to get to somewhere better. 
These things aren't really what guarantees that I'd never voluntarily stay here again. The morning after we arrive, I get woken up by a jackhammer cracking cement directly under our window. We were on the 9th floor, and it was still insanely loud. My boyfriend had to call and get a different room because it was going on all day. When I spoke to them, they didn't seem to register how annoying it would be to be on vacation and unable to sleep in. After a few hours they get us a new room, no offer to help us move our things, and they put us in another room on the opposite side of the building, also with construction under the window. Same story the very next morning. We also noticed that several of the guest rooms were having work done on them. I know that HRH isn't anywhere close to the same scale as Bellagio, but when they are doing construction on a certain floor, they don't put you within 2 floors, either direction, of the offensive sound. I guess that would be kind of hard since they were re-doing the exterior. In my opinion, though, you should advise people that construction is going on. I guess that would require them to compensate people in some way, but isn't that better than having pissed off guests that will never return? 
Better yet, we got home and the boyfriend sees a $55 charge on his AmEx from the minibar. Neither of us had anything from the mini bar in either rooms. Lovely.",4,2,2

They said they would replace it and we don't have to be there.   We lrft and got dinner came back and the room still smelled like weed and the comforter was never replaced.   We had to call back several times and it was finally replaced at 1am.  The next day i had the work a trade show at the hotel (which was the main reason i stayed at the hotel and ignored the bad yelp reviews.. i was thinking it cant be that bad ... how wrong i was ... the bad yelp reviews were on point). Anyway getting ready for the event I was about to take a shower and found the supposedly new towel was dirty or stained with some type of brown colored something ... grosss!!  I returned a few times and the room still reaked of weed.  I immediatly went to the front desk to complain and they said i can move rooms but i would have to do it now.  I informed the manager that i was busy with the trade show and if we can do it later.  He said ok but if the rooms are gone that there is nothing he can do and he couldnt hold one for me.  Uncaring and didnt seem like he cared.  We finally moved rooms it didnt smell like weed but there was a white stain on the seat cushion that seemed like semen.  We complained and they still didnt do anything.  

I checked in my employees into a non-smoking room and was informed by them that they couldn't sleep because of the strong smell of smoke.  Thier daughter had a hard time breathing.


So after my last review ... on the way down to the casino there was blood on the elevator buttons and inside the elevator... we told the cleaners and several of the employees of hard rock hotel and they never cleaned it up... its been more than 24 hours already... the service here is really bad ... we have stayed at several hotels around the area and this is the worst by far... 

Pictures will be posted of the towel and seat cushion. ...

UPDATE
----------------------

upon check out the comped us a night and resort fees but all the trouble we went through was not worth it.  something should have been done before the check out.  And keep in mind that we had to make a whole lot of whoop whoop to get something done.  We told them that they really have bad ratings on yelp and it seems like they didnt care.  that explains why nothing was done right away.  All in all they comped us for certain things but it was like pulling teeth to get something done.  I will definitely not stay here in the future.  i think it would have been better to stay at a cheap hotel.  Oh they did call me to offer me a couple free nights in the suites.  I told them i would think about it and they said they would send me an email.  Never got the email.  Like i said just goes to show of how mush BS they are and that they dont care about the guests.  anyways I have already posted the pictures... I hope this helps and keeps people from staying at this disgusting place.",4,0,0

I was extremely nervous about staying here since almost all the reviews I read were terrible. I mean people were talking about finding poop in their beds! I was pretty terrified! 

As soon as we arrived the front desk people were extremely helpful. We arrived three hours before check in and they had our rooms ready within the hour. Both of our rooms were the double queen poolside suites. They were gorgeous! Very clean and spacious. We have a living room area and a huge bathroom. Although other people have had horrible experiences I really found that our stay was great. The beds were comfortable and everyone in our group was satisfied by the service and the quality of the room especially since they were comped. 

The only downside was that the hotel was so far from the strip but anywhere you stay you still have to take a taxi everywhere so that didn't really bother me. It was a great weekend and I would def come back again!",3,0,0

On June 22nd 2016 upon valet receiving of my car at Bellagio. I did a 360 check of my suv. Not damage. Drove to HRH tower and valet my suv once again. This is now a.m. early hours of the 23rd of June 2016. Got interrogated by the big husky valet guy once again about ""are you a member here, what room are you in, which tower, let me see your hotel key card"" keep in mind this is the 3rd time this big husky guy has asked me this. It got annoying and it started to make me question my existence here! 
-- went upstairs to the HRH tower and called it a night. Checked out of hotel at 1pm. Walked over to valet and the same big husky dude said "" your car is here (and points on the left side of where I was standing (front bronze door of valet) he said "" your car is here did you need me to pull it up?"" At this point I'm just tired of him. Keep in mind I tip $5 for short valet and $10 for longer than 1 hour , to every valet guy everywhere I valet at and I always do a walk around of the car\/suv. 
-- well guess what? This time I didn't bc I just wanted to roll my own luggage over and carry it in the trunk myself. Hopped in the suv and drove to the rental place. Get to the rental place and the guy walks around the suv... "" mam has this dent and scratch always been here?"" My response "" what dent and scratch?!"" Walked around to his side and saw a big fender dent and long paint gone missing scratch to the fender. So now I'm pissed and for damn sure I checked my car prior to arriving at the HRH. To think it was a kind gesture to have parked in the front for me. Guess that's where they park all the dent and scuff cars and put you in that awkward predicament ""car is here, did you need me to pull it up"" 
--- this is my second time in 6 months staying at the HRH tower at the hard rock for 5\/6 nights minimum. I love it. I love the comfort, the relaxing rooms, the clean environment, the great front desk, concierge and room service. This place gets a 5 star for stay, peacefulness not having to go elbow to elbow with someone just trying to walk by. The smell of the hotel is like a vanilla, fruit light non nose irritating smell. I definitely don't smell smoke in the air not unless I'm sitting directly next to someone who was smoking. Perfect place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle , don't get me wrong theirs better stays out there but it's always over packed and I'd witness the valet service line stretch around the block so I'd pass on busy popular hotels. 
-- but valet service and the dent and scratch does not sit well with me! Own up to your accident I would of even said its ok its just an accident but to try to play me like a fool, some bodies going to pay for it! I've gone 12 years with no accidents, dents, dings of any kind and I'd be a fool if I took this as something I did when indeed I DID NOT. 
--will this change my opinion on staying here anymore? It will affect my decision by 60% 
Why valet at a hotel you don't trust with your car? Until hard rock contacts me back with a link to post reviews about their Valet service , this post is affiliated with the hard rock being its valet service and therefore it will remain here until I remove it.",6,1,1

The room we stayed in had a nice modern look to it. The cleanliness of the room looked good except on the back of the bathroom door there were what looked like dry buggers.

Pros: check in counter is really cool looking, very modern. When we checked in we asked for a complimentary upgrade which she gave us (ended up being a standard room but in one of the newer towers and high floor), modern\/nice decor in room, facility and room clean. Ate at Pink Taco and Mr. lucky's both were good. Pool staff were very nice (one guy even gave us an extra towel to use as a pillow while we were laying out!), pool is very nice, very tropical feel with the beach. Lots of really cool memorabilia. Comfy beds LOVED the down filled comforter. Lots of elevators so wait time is pretty minimal. Nice TV in room.

Cons: no coffee pot. I've stayed at 2 star hotels that have coffee pots. I stayed at 17 different hotels in 2014 and this hotel was the first not to offer a coffee pot!! I really felt like Hard Rock is just super money hungry. They don't want to give you a coffee pot because they want you to buy a coffee from their coffee shops and charge $4+. Also no refrigerator and no complimentary water. So you end up paying $4 for a bottle of water there. Just ridiculous. Not even sure what the resort fee covers other than wifi. 
-House keeping. Really only had 2 problems. One drink we got on the second day just sat there for the 5 days we stayed in the room. They never disposed of it nor any water bottles unless we put it in the trash. Second; on the first day the little lotion had clearly exploded it had dried lotion all over it and could tell that the top was not sealed...didn't stop them from putting it out for us. They also only replaced the soaps and what not once in our 5 days. Every hotel I stay at gives you new items EVERY day. Those little shampoo containers are good for one wash between my husband and I so that means we will go through one\/day. I had to find a maid and restock myself.
-Everything there was VERY expensive. Margaritas at Pink Taco were $10\/ea and at Rehab it was $13!!!! (But they were good). Once again, money hungry. My husband had breakfast alone at Mr Lucky's and it was $35!! (2 bloody Mary's) 
-Rehab on the weekend is VERY loud in your room. Happy that it stopped by 6pm but really was hard to take a nap. 
-Lighting in the room is very dim. I understand mood lighting but let that be a choice for guests with a dimmer option. The bathroom was particularly dim. When I'm taking a shower I need to see everything, shaving is incredibly hard if you can't see well. The dim lighting is what really convinced me this hotel was not for us. 
-and lastly, the kicker. Fire alarm went off twice. The first one we walked down 14 floors of stairs (elevators automatically shut off). When we got down stairs staff didn't know what had happened.
The second alarm went off at 6:45 IN THE MORNING!!!!!!!! And it didn't shut off for at least 10 minutes. When I called down stairs the lady gave me attitude which annoyed me more. I'm sure a bunch of grumpy people were calling pretty upset but that's because it's 6:45 IN THE MORNING. Come on Hard Rock can't you hire technicians that understand electrical wiring so they know NOT to activate the fire alarm especially at 6:45am....I mean I understand this is probably an ""isolated"" experience (although it happened twice for us) but it's enough for me NEVER to come back. It was obvious that they don't hire technicians advanced enough to not hit the alarm and that know how to get it off immediately as well as hiring staff that could actually be patient and kind at 6:45am.

So in a nutshell: if you're young and have money to blow then you will enjoy this hotel. Otherwise don't waste you're money. Even if you get a fantastic deal it's not worth it.",5,0,0

The pool area has two sides - one for the public debauterous party called Rehab for younger 20-30 year olds getting severely drunk and messy and the other private side called Nirvana for guests, families and kids. Both pool areas were nice, but hotel guests couldn't use the better Rehab side with lazy river and water slides because Rehab is Sat, Sun and Wed every week and in between they are closed for maintenance. The drinks were not good and way overpriced (I live in NYC so I'm used to overpaying, but they were a bit out of control). The food was not very good at the places I ventured into. There is a shuttle to the strip from 10am-5pm (the hotel is a bit off the beaten path, but close enough to walk to the strip or monorail in less than 10 mins).

We stayed in the Paradise Tower which had a view of the pool and the Strip. The room was dim lit, but was otherwise comfy.  We ate at Pink Taco, Mr Luckys and Johnny Smalls. I recommend the latter and suggest you best get the eat all you can tapas coz the a la carte is expensive for a tapas place. Pink Taco had a $5 for 5 tacos and $1 frozen margaritas but the hubby said the drink was too sweet.

I'd like to take a minute and express my frustration over the obligatory ""resort fee"" charged by the Had Rock. 

The services provided by the fee are ridiculous. 

Free local calls = silly I have a mobile phone

Free long distance = silly I have a mobile phone

Free Internet = silly I have a mobile phone 

Access to the workout facility = yeah, it was busy every time I passed by it. The notion of charging extra for something that is included as part of the room price is dumb. 

I don't recall being charged a pillow fee, a blanket fee, or a a charge for soap I didn't use. That's a good idea though. You should charge me for soap I don't use and call it a sanitation fee. 

Moreover, the design of the showers in our room doesn't appear to be well thought out in that the water must be turned on while one is standing directly in the path if the water. 



Beyond this ridiculousness of the fee, we had a good time. The gaming tables are well served and dealers are friendly. DrInks were a bit over priced. 

We did appreciate the bedding and pillows. The A\/C took a while to make it palatable for sleep - and I am glad we stayed in the winter time frame as it doesn't appear reasonable the A\/C could keep up with this in the summer time. 

All in all, please know that this fee will ultimately precent me from staying or playing with you again. I know you'll say that my choices are limited for your services in Las Vegas - but I'll take my chances that I can find a place to stay and play somewhere else.",4,3,0

We used to stay here for the pool but probably won't be back.  They want $500 to use a cabana, even when only about 20 people are at the pool.

I came on a business trip and each time we go to Vegas we try to experience a new hotel. When we arrived in our room there were disgusting greasy handprints on the headboard of each of our beds! GROOOOSSS right?????  Overall our room just felt dirty. There was what looked like dried up vomit in the bathroom next to the toilet paper. One word...disgusting. When we called to tell them about or room they just said they would send up housekeeping to assess it. When she got there even she was disgusted and sanitized both headboards completely. The shower constantly flooded so we would have a pool in the bathroom, who need rehab if you have your own personal pool in your room I guess. I would not recommend this to anyone. 
The only positive was that our room did have a nice view of the strip and the pools were pretty.",3,2,0

The hotel is pretty nice. Pretty clean for a casino. They have some shops and a nice bar by the Pink Tacos restaurant. Saw kiss in concert this weekend there. Nice place. Have lots of music memorabilia.  I actually prefer to see concerts here. Hotel is not on the strip but it not super far. I suggest you take a cab though. About $9 for the ride depending on where you get dropped off. Beware of taxi lines after the shows. You could be waiting and hour!  Would like to stay here one time.

When I turned on the 50"" plasma for the first time the in-house music channel was playing Social Distortion, which I took as a good sign.

However, it's funny that they have complimentary pencils in the rooms instead of pens; I suppose you have to minimize The Hard Rock debauchery somewhere and at some level.

The only downside of my stay was the room next door to mine was occupied by Rap type dudes who blasted their ""music"" insanely loud for 2 of the 3 nights I was there.. but when you stay at The Hard Rock that's what you have to expect.  I'm not a rookie:  I had earplugs.

Perhaps it is due to the fact that I was finally able to see on of my all-time favorite bands (Wolfmother) live in concert, but this place was a perfect concert venue. I sold my girlfriend on coming out to Vegas for a weekend just to see this band. 

First off: the security guys here are super-strict!! Everyone entering the the venue was thoroughly frisked and all ladies' purses were searched. So be careful what you bring with you, you may lose it. I'd like to thank the security guys for giving us a weed-free show. I don't judge people who smoke weed, I just hate the smell of that crap. 

After making it through security, everything was chill. Good pre-show music played over the sound system, FREE tequila sunrises until 9pm, and there was room to wander around. All for $25!! The entire venue is general admission standing room only unless you rent a cabana. 

We chose to sit across the pool from the band, giving us an opportunity to hang out with out feet in the water all night. Another thing I really liked was that there is enough room for everyone to spread out a bit and enjoy the show. We never felt like it was crowded, even though there were a lot of people there. 

I guess the only thing that seemed lacking was the stage lighting on the stage. It was pretty basic. I don't know who arranges lighting, whether the band brings their own lighting guys or the venue provides it, but it could have been better. It was still cool, though. 

We didn't play in the casino at all, but it looked decent enough and was packed with people having a good time. 

So, an epic rock band, cool staff, free drinks, and great atmosphere made for the one hell of a show and a great time at the Hard Rock. 5, face-melting, hard rock, stars!",2,1,1

After a 2000 mile motorcycle road trip staying in motels in random towns, I was ready for my splurgy hotel.  I expected all the glitz and glamour Vegas has to offer with our HRH room.  Like most things in life, I should've lowered my expectations, because I was sorely disappointed.  

Atmosphere:  More or less my thing.  Definitely not my bf's thing.  Too loud, too wild, and too crazy for his liking.  I liked the decor, it was sleek and modern.  I thought the sexy catalog on the bed was cheap and tacky.

Room:  Clean modern lines.  White, black and red motif with a big comfy bed.

Service:  Good and bad.  Either way, our problems were dealt with quickly...but not throughly.  Let me explain.

After hauling up a motorcycle trunk all the way from self parking (how do you valet a motorcycle?) I was happy to be in our room.  Until we realized how dirty it was.  There was still dried red puke surrounding the toilet.  EWW.  A call down got us an upgrade to a room in the new tower.  I wish they would have sent someone to help us with our luggage, I mean, it WAS their fault.  We lugged our three trunks back down and across the hotel to the new tower.  The lady had promised that we would love our new upgraded room.  We loved the room.  We didn't love that it was a smoking room and there was ash everywhere, even in the shower!  I didn't call again, we just dealt with it.  

Toiletries:  Great items.  I can't quite remember what kind they were, but they were great.

Overall:  I can't respect or recommend a hotel that doesn't clean their rooms well.  Seriously, it's gross.  Stay for the party party atmosphere, then go somewhere else and sleep.",3,0,1

I have always liked Hard Rock, when I worked at the cafe in the Inner Harbor in Baltimore or got hammered drunk many a weekend at 207 in downtown San Diego.

I drove here on an impromptu trip to Vegas with my boyfriend to see Queens of the Stone Age at 'The Joint', one of the venues at the HRH in Vegas.

Our room was decent, cheap (mid week\/overnight on a Thursday) and clean.  The bath products were simple, nothing to write home about, and I wondered if the duvet had been washed (you know what they say about hotel duvet covers and comforters).  The tv had seen better days and would often get stuck on one channel.  That was irritating.  The bed was comfy though not much sleeping was had ha ha.

I think the room was $ 75 which is a great price all things considered.

We did receive the wrong key from our friendly and flamboyantly gay concierge, so after trying to decipher the chicken scratch written on the key card envelope and if in fact we were attempting to access the correct room we were assisted by housekeeping.

The parking garage is also weird.  You cannot access level 2 unless you valet park.  We lost the car and turns out it was on another level but this was a fun game to play hungover.

The casino is well laid out, I love the center circular bars, and in general has a very friendly staff.

Be aware that they charge you a ""resort fee"", even if you have a Groupon or some other rate. This covers all the facilities and internet.

I like Hard Rock because it's vibe is different. Cooler, hipper but still accessible, full of pretty people... And they have AWESOME go-go dancers! Normally, the sight of young girls gyrating on a pole for money makes me feel sorry for them. I think to myself ""how much would this poor girl rather be doing something else for a living?"" And I typically watch in muted horror as they shake their wiggly hips and bend in ways that must've served them well when they had aspirations of being a ballerina instead. The girls at the Hard Rock, however, made me feel otherwise. I watched as they danced the night away -- captivated by one girl in particular with short, pixie-styled dark hair, who knew how to WORK a ROOM. I swear, based on my attentiveness to her performance, every guy there must've thought I was a lesbian (I'm not), but it was just so refreshing to see a dancer who (a) actually knew how to DANCE, (b) obviously liked to perform and didn't look pitiful, and (c) was beautiful and alluring without being skanky. Good for her -- I give snaps!

Other than the show, Body English was stupid... We were supposed to be on a VIP list for entry, but because we came at 12:15 (and not 12am) we were told lists were no longer being honored and we'd have to wait in line and pay the cover like everyone else. Not to be a traitor to my gender and all, but it was a bespectacled snooty girl who apprised me of this snafu -- I have a feeling if I'd been dealing with a guy, it wouldn't have been a problem. For whatever reason this girl had decided she didn't like me and was going put her flat iron of a foot down. So we said 'thanks, but no thanks.' 

What happened next wasn't Hard Rock's fault, so I can't really take off stars (though it would've been nice if their response would've been quick and with concern), but the high point of the evening had to be when I got thrown up on whilst at the ATM near the cashier. There I was, innocently standing by in my pinstripe skirt and T-strap ""CFM"" heels while my boyfriend used the ATM, when a lurching Drunky McDrunk-Drunk stumbled over to us (holding on to the wall for dear life), and proceeded to vomit all over himself, the wall, ATM, floor, and me.

3 stars for our room. I've read some reviews about the rooms being dirty... blood stains on the sheets. When we walked in, I was expecting it to be dirty... I swear I checked the sheets right away :) Our room was pretty clean, no blood on the sheets. The mini bar was missing an item, which I let them know right away. Could not take that chance, so much shady reviews about the mini bar and the whole place. Housekeeping did not knock on door with the ""do not disturb"" sign ;) 
Our stay was not bad, but I wish I read the reviews before we booked. They need to quit trying to get more money during check in.",0,0,0

We booked a room that we had prepaid for in the main tower. After a delayed flight, we go to check in and the guy states oh we booked up that tower already, we are putting you in the Paradise tower that is clear across the the property! We were pretty upset, seeing as we had already paid prior to showing up and then find out it was a different room than what we had paid for! But wait it gets better...

We go to the room, spend the night and go about our work meetings all day for the first day. We get back around 6 or 7pm exhausted from the day, only to find out our keys didn't work? The front desk said oh if you put it by your cell phone or any other card it deactivates them. Wow, great to know after the fact and after we walked all the way back to the room and finally after security came by and let us in we find out the room was never cleaned and we had zero towels. We went down to the lobby and told them the room needed to be cleaned and we then we were going to go for a swim. Oh, the pool was closed prior to 7!? We asked the front desk guy and he claimed all the hotels close the pools around this time.. hmm.. so I called the hotel across the street and guess what?! No, this was a lie because they were open till 9pm there!

Disappointed even more, we then head to dinner, go to get their 'backstage pass' card that gives you a small discount here and there at the hotel restaurants from the 'money cage' because that is the only place you can get it. There is only one person helping people and after 30 minutes of waiting we gave up.

We head over to Nobu for sushi and it's closed for 2 days! Ok, next try.. we go to Pink Taco and the only highlight of this place was the bartender was awesome and probably the only guy that gave us good service at the hotel.

Next we go to ask the front desk, has the room been cleaned and the girl without even checking says oh yes it has... hmm.. we go up and of course it was not cleaned! We called and now spoke to a manager - Hector, who said he's send someone up to clean the room and bring towels etc. someone showed up only with towels! The poor guy had no idea our ordeal and we asked he have housekeeping sent up. Finally, now almost midnight, we get our room cleaned.

The manager offered no discount or comp to our room, even after his incompetence. I'll never go back here again and will recommend everyone stay far away from this place! I was hoping to relax a bit in between my work trip, but they completely killed it!",3,4,0

Start on the pennies, work up to the quarters, then try your luck on some dollar and five-dollar machines.

Also, the Hard Rock has an all-you-can-eat tapas place that is simply amazing. So.. good casino, good food... It's all good and I think I'd probably stay here next time for those two reasons. Sure it's not on the strip, but who walks around in Vegas anyway? A cab ride is a cab ride.",0,0,3

Aesthetically, there is a very nice feel throughout the entire property, and the rooms were top notch for the price.  I felt comfortable and the bed was among the most comfortable I've slept in.  Granted, sleeping is about the only thing that I did within the walls of the resort.

The things that make me hesitant to stay again are that... while I don't mind paying a resort fee for things that I use, I don't like paying a resort fee for things that I don't or get denied use. I'll elaborate.

1)  We paid the $17.00 fee for valet, shuttle and fitness center, but were denied use of the valet service because they were ""too backed up"".. twice.

2) We didn't need the shuttle due to driving our own car.

3) We didn't use the fitness center because.... we just didn't.


Aside from that.. the only other tidbit of annoyance stemmed from being interrupted by the IT service man because there is a router in every three rooms, and mine happened to be the one in which the router was malfunctioning. 

Take from this what you will.   The service was good.  The attitude was professional and courteous and it is it's own bubbled paradise.

We paid some extra money to upgrade to a different tower with a room available.  Trying to get to our room however was a disaster.  The paradise tower is the same location where people line up and get to their rooms.  I was manhandled through security to get through with our luggage.

On our third day at the hotel, we were told wristbands to enter the pool would be $20 each, which I thought was ridiculous - there was no special guest or live show, so it made no sense.  But, $40 wasn't enough money to argue over, so...whatever.  Then at the desk, she said it would be $100 each.  To enter the pool at a hotel we were guests at?!!  ok, that was enough to argue over.  She said she was sorry and that they are supposed to inform guests of this at check-in - - but, they hadn't, to which she replied again, ""sorry"".  Oh well!  sorry we didn't do our job.  You'll still owe us $200, though, if you want to use the pool.  EXTORTION - plain and simple.  The only option was to check out on a Sunday afternoon, pack up our stuff and move to another hotel - so I paid the money and we went in...and the pool area was basically dead.  Nobody there....pathetic really.

Come to find out, the new policy is to charge you extra for the pool if you book through a travel site (i booked through expedia).  Not to mention, the pool fee changes at their whim.  One minute it was $20 - in 5 minutes, it was $100.  It says nothing on the expedia site or on the hard rock site - I guess they're going to inform people of this new rule one disgruntled guest at a time.

I've seen some of hard rock's responses to these scathing reviews of their new way of doing business - and I'm sure they'll respond with another ""We're sorry...there are many options in hotels when visiting Las Vegas""  And you know what?  They're exactly right.",7,3,1

The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated (total rock 'n roll theme) with contemporary bathrooms, but not as noise-blocking as some other Vegas hotels. We don't gamble, so the small casino isn't a big deal to us. The prices are super reasonable and more than make up for the distance from the strip. They do have a shuttle that goes there but it ends at 5, I believe, making it more or less pointless.

Recommend: Have 2 credit cards with triple balance of what your rate, resort fee and deposits will be TRUST ME, however you get what you pay for :) Book a daybed or cabana at Rehab, it is well worth it!  Pay the fee to have a Refrigerator brought to your room $21 a day and load it with bottle water, also if you are driving make your own bar in your room from Costco & Bevmo, snacks are wise too for more than a 24 hour stay.  Pay for early check in at 9am its also another $25 fee, Pay for late Check out as well $25 fee.  Culinary Dropout is a Fox concept and is really fun!  I love the fondue.  I like the Vegas location better than Scottsdale. 

GO TO THE SPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pay the $25 entry fee for hotel guests or book a treatment, it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  If you are an early riser like me, fighting a hangover can be rough, I recommend taking your phone, ipad, paper, book, go in PJ's and slip into a warm robe, claim a private Turkish daybed built into the wall, close the curtain and relax...take a warm dip, a steam dip with an ice towel, hot sauna to cold shower and then do it all over again until you feel human finish off with nap then go to the juice bar just outside.  Enjoy the standard spa fare; citrus water everywhere, bottled water literally everywhere, fruit and snacks and light snacks like nuts and cereal.    

I have stayed in Vegas 24 times but this was my first stay at Hard Rock and I love it because it feels like a real resort like you would find in Cabo or the Bahamas.  Head across the street over to Rumor when you got bored and hang out in the GIANT purple chair by the pool.

Charged by these positive memories I booked a deal on Travelzoo for 2 nights. I booked a Sunday-Tuesday trip and made the mistake of requesting a room with a pool view. The reason why this was giant misstep on my part is because it was August and when we arrived around 5pm on Sunday Rehab was still going strong. We dodged drunk zombies while making our way through the casino and over towards the Paradise Tower elevators. Upon walking into our room all we could hear was the loud thumping bass and music from the pool even though our room was on the 16th floor. We didn't think much of it since we figured the pool would close at sundown that would be the end of the loud factor. WRONG! At night, the nightclub's music was blaring....and at 9am in the morning on Monday and Tuesday I was awoken by the music again. When I can sing along to what's playing at the pool while I'm in bed on the 16th floor that's beyond lame. 

Apart from all the obnoxious drunk people stumbling around because of Rehab and the fact that napping or sleeping in was out of the question. The rest of the hotel was acceptable.

There are numerous pools (but enter at your own risk because you might catch a disease, I watched some of the debauchery going on in those pools from my room), there's a nice gym, they offer a free shuttle to the Fashion Show mall on the strip every hour, self parking was easy, pink taco had 99 cent margaritas and tacos and HH specials, Mr. Luckys was open 24 hours and had food specials too, I liked the music the casino played, the staff and security were pleasant (there's definitely a lot of security here compared to any other hotel), we spotted Ronnie from MTV's Jersey Shore, I liked the decor of the room, and people feel the Paradise tower is too far from the casino and restaurants, but that never bothered me.

Sweet suite! The room was nice and roomy and the bathroom was sleek and modern; large tub, large glass shower with double shower heads and a double sink. It seems like they recently remodeled the HRH Towers and they did a great job with the rooms. The views were nice and the feel of the room was subdued rocker.. The room did smell like fresh ganga, but hey it's Vegas; at least there wasn't a dead hooker under my bed or something. 

Aside from the room, the casino was a little lackluster and it seemed that most people were staying in their rooms and slugging back the 12 packs they brought along with them.. There were some booty shaking girls hanging on poles in the casino, so that was nice if you are a guy...Im not, so I opted to go elsewhere to drink and dine...and roll dice.

Overall, not a bad stay and I liked the room and for the price it was a great value.. The downer for me was the small casino and lack of night life or any life at all.. the food was very mediocre.. but the spa services were great.",4,2,1

My husband and I used to adore this hotel, restaurants, the people that work here and the ambience that this hotel used to have.

I have noticed a huge decline in the customer service. The quality of the employees that work here is simply horrendous. When you go to eat in the restaurant at the hard rock hotel the staff that works in the restaurants, don't make you feel welcomed. They seemed to be burden by the guests that come there,  they seem unhappy that they have to serve you. The bartenders and the hostess have nothing but attitudes and they have no problem expressing it right to your face because they will give you strange looks and roll their eyes are you right in your face lol ) . 

 my husband are extremely friendly and out going we like to carry friendly conversations with bartenders or waitresses or servers and the fact that it was very rare to even come across an employee that made you feel welcome to be at the hard rock was extremely disappointing. 

The hard rock hotel really needs to look into hiring a better quality staff, or look into people that are huge in hospitality. 

I'm not trying to be funny, sadly I think the cleaning lady that cleaned our room during our stay was the most friendliest person we have come across in this establishment.

The hard rock hotel used to be one of my favorite places to stay while visiting Vegas I'm honestly heartbroken to even admit that now I will be definitely looking into a different hotel to stay the next time I come to Vegas.",4,1,1

The reason they're receiving only one star is that upon checkout they added a $24.64 charge PER DAY resort fee. I know this may be a common (shady) practice on and near the strip in Vegas, but I've since found out that the Hard Rock in particular is known for burying this fee: www.travelandleisure.com\/travel-blog\/carry-on\/topic\/news\/trip-doctor-what-is-a-resort-fee-and-do-i-really-have-to-pay-it

When checking out, it was the first time I was told I had to pay this fee. They said that I had signed for it at check in (it's at the bottom of the fine print you have to scroll down and it's near the end beneath where where you sign your name on the credit card machine,) it's in the fine print on their website, and it's in the sleeve that holds the key cards. They also said its part of the script upon checking in, but all they mentioned was that there'd be a $50 per day hold against room incidentals. 

The resort fee is a way for hotels to publish low room rates, but then tack on an extra 20-30% or more. 

It's sad that we ended an otherwise enjoyable trip to have the last few coins wrung out of us. Very short sighted, as those will be the last few coins you'll see from us, Hard Rock.",3,4,0

The Hard Rock was originally a joint venture between Peter Morton (founder of the Hard Rock Cafes) and Harvey's Casino in Lake Tahoe (itself later bought out by Harrah's Entertainment), opening in 1995.  I started staying at the Hard Rock right after it opened, and have stayed there dozens of times.  Just two years later, in 1997, Harvey's sold its stake to Morton, who became the sole owner.

The original Hard Rock featured only 340 rooms, and maintains a still small by Vegas standards (30,000 square feet) casino.  For all its high energy rock music and lively crowd (it has gone back and forth, trading places with casinos on the Strip and also with the Palms, for being ""the"" hot spot for the young, hip crowd), the Hard Rock's casino is not the greatest.  The rules on their blackjack give the house an undue advantage, and they limit most players to a $5000. max on most games (I was allowed to bet $10,000. due to my high credit line).  As well, especially during the Peter Morton years (he sold his stake in 2006 to Morgans Hotel Group), the casino really sweated any high end players (or any players at all), who they thought might be counting cards or were winning too much for any reason.  At the Hard Rock, look for constant shuffling by dealers if they think someone is being too lucky at any card game.  After a certain celebrity at the casino was tipping out too much at the table games (dealer tipped money goes out of reach of the casino for good), Morton implemented a paltry ""$25. maximum tip per hand rule"" to keep money on the table and within the casino's greedy grasp.  That sort of hard line rule to keep the money with the casino is representative of how things are at the Hard Rock -
they absolutely don't want you to take much money, if any, home.  There really aren't too many tables of anything running at the same time (and only one Baccarat table), so your choices are limited to switching tables if one starts running badly for you, which is detrimental to serious gamblers.  All that said - when the Hard Rock is packed, it provides a fabulous casino atmosphere of scantily clad hipster or wannabee hipster females, and cocktail waitresses, that presents a high energy, trendy crowd.  But on a Sunday when few are in the casino and everyone is losing, the circular casino resembles, in many ways, a dark bus depot.

As far as comps, you will get more for your gambling money here than at the highest end Strip casinos, but less than at the downtown casinos.

Until Morton remodeled the suites, and later owners added the Paradise and HRH Towers, the suites were only so so, as far as luxury.  While all suites included a great sound system, the bathroom floors were linoleum and the showers not even marble until about 1999, when everything started getting more like in the Vegas strip suites.  Nowadays the all suite HRH Tower, and Paradise Tower, are nice.

If you do stay at the Hard Rock, whatever room you get, especially in the original Casino Tower, get a room POOL SIDE because these both include balconies and are slightly larger than the rooms not facing the pool. 

The Hard Rock does have a nice spa \/ weight room, that includes some free weights, and a great steam room.  The pool is great too, with cabanas, and a weekend (Fri, Sat, Sun, during all but winter months) event called ""Rehab"" for people to relax, swim, gamble pool side, take in the bikini clad girls and in general recover (""Rehab"") from the night before.  You can get into all of these, the spa, and Rehab, free if you gamble enough, but otherwise everything costs extra at the Hard Rock.

The Joint features some top bands, and is a close up intimate venue. Again, all free if you're a gambler, tickets available for most events for anyone else. I've seen bands like the Rolling Stones, Offspring, Lenny Kravitz, and many others there.  I was at the casino in 2002 for The Who, but the show was cancelled when John Entwhistle died, in Room 658, a suite in which I have stayed several times.

The Hard Rock does not utilize the usual stretch limos to drive around their VIPs, but rather purple Cadillac Escalades.

Some of the great restaurants at the Hard Rock, such as AJ's Steakhouse (very old school, Rat Pack era style), and Ago, are closed, but the Pink Taco (started by Peter Morton's son, Harry), and Nobu are there, and are good.  The late night Mr. Lucky's is not bad at all for an all night place.

You may buy Hard Rock memorabilia at their Hard Rock Store.

Basically, you go to the Hard Rock to have fun and relax.  It is not a serious gambling casino, so don't try to break the house there because more likely - it will break YOUR bank.  Nor is it ultra luxury, but if the rock and roll vibe appeals to you, it's definitely worth a try, and after staying once or twice you will know whether this place is for you, or not.",3,1,2

Price- We got comped rooms here so I'm not sure how pricey it is generally. 

Service-  Excellent.   Even the pit boss and dealers were very friendly.  We had ordered food at the Circle Bar.  They lagged a bit getting us our food and ending up comping our food and a round of drinks.  

Mr. Lucky's-  Not the greatest, but always open. 

Location-  Off the strip but a cab ride was a mere $9 with tip.  Most of the time, we spent gambling\/drinking here anyways.

Casino\/Crowd-  $5 tables for black jack and craps during the day.  $10 is the cheapest I saw at night.  Music gets very loud at night where you have to yell to be heard.  However, the music selection is pretty good. Varies in age, but very hip and energized.

Rooms-  Guest room with a view of... Not sure what it was because of the construction.  Construction starts Mon-Sat early in the morning.  I heard they are building more towers and another pool.   At night, someone checks your room key at entrance.  Rooms are very spacious, flat screen tv, Bose system (no ipod player though), modern furniture, plush towels and sheets, fluffy pillows and comfy beds, fully stocked mini bar, and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries.

Sports Bar-  Horrible.  Incredibly small and little seating.  Go to Mandalay instead.

Pool- Closed when we were there.",1,0,0

I've stayed here multiple times, in every type of room and for me it's pretty comfortable.   I usually prefer to stay here rather than Vdara or one of the on-strip hotels, but only because I always have a car.  I've had mixed experiences with the staff & service.  I've never had anyone give me a comped upgrade even on a Monday when it's dead.  

THE GOOD:

~ Comfy beds in every room, no matter which room you choose
~ Contemporary, large, nice looking rooms & hotel
~ Gorgeous pool area with multiple pools and a huge ""beach""
~ Fun crowd, not many kids or elderly people

THE BAD:

~ Off strip location
~ Daily Service Fee really adds up ($25ish per night + taxes)
~ Not a big fan of the restaurants, but the pink taco was good enough
~ Weird pool rules and restricted areas that I never really understood
~ Check in and check out can take some time 

Overall, if I get a good deal on the room, I will stay here.  Otherwise, probably not.

More Details....

----ROOMS----
All of the rooms are nice, but the HRH tower rooms are the nicest except for the luxury\/specialty suites.  I've stayed in every tower and there is something to appreciate about each one.  The casino tower has doors you can open, if you like fresh air.  The bathrooms are older but the room size is very nice and contemporary in style.  The paradise tower has gorgeous pool views and a very fresh feel with a more modern bathroom.  The elevators are great and super fast.

-----POOL-------
The pool area is massive with lots of places to go.  I've never really understood the rules or how it works with all the different closed sections so I just make my way around and pick a spot I like.  Last time I got a cabana and it was really lovely, but BEWARE, the prices on the menu are very high!  I had 3 glasses of wine and 3 buckets (5 each) of beer and the bill was $200.  Also, the gratuity is included so be careful not to tip twice when you're to wasted to notice.  

------FOOD------
There are several restaurants with different styles and price points.  
35 Steaks- Very disappointed.  I ate here several times and never loved it.
Mr. Lucky's- Had breakfast here.  Wasn't impressed, but it did the job.
Pink Taco- Much better than expected.  I was not impressed with the 99 cent tacos or margarita's (pure sugar) but the regular menu was great.
Nobu- Japanese Cuisine, never ate there

-----CASINO---------
The casino is filled with everything you could want for.  I like it!  All tables and games are offered.

~~~NOTE~~~

One thing I would like to make a note on is that room cleanliness is VERY IMPORTANT!  I have read several reviews on here about the lack of cleanliness in these rooms.

My latest stay was less than two weeks ago.  I was attending an event, and a friend ended up crashing in my room.  She was not added to the room as an authorized guest.  The second key stopped working while I was off the property and the hotel just issued her a new key with only verification of my cell number (if they had my cell number, one would think they would just call and ask if it was okay).  Emails to management about this have gone unreturned.  I didn't bother to mention it to front desk staff, as they had little interest in addressing other issues I've had there in the past.  It is most unfortunate for the annual event I attend, as I will not be returning next year, because this hotel is the absolute worst.

The atmosphere was amazing, the drinks were flowing a plenty and didn't skimp on the alcohol at all like some bars like to do (although i think that had to do partly with the fact that the poor bartenders were overwhelmed as the night drew closer to the grand finale of midnight) . 

We gambled, we drank, we people watched.  Time seemed to go by pretty fast here.  Lots to look at in the casino area alone from all the memorabilia they have even when you aren't gambling. Very friendly staff as well, no one made us feel as though we had to tone anything down, obviously as long as we weren't ruining the vibe for every one else.

When the time for midnight drew near we made our way to the top level of the parking garage as did a lot of other people.  This in my opinion is the BEST spot to view all the fireworks that the strip has to offer!  You could see every single strip casino's fireworks from the top floor of that parking garage. Much better than the previous year of spending N.Y.E. on the strip where you are packed like sardines and basically rubbing your whole body against complete strangers........with no bathrooms in sight (since the casinos on the strip close their doors for about a half hour before and a half hour after midnight if i remember right)

Myself, never having heard of  paying additional for a suite and being downgraded I expressed my disappointment. With an attitude the attendant asked me ""what do you want me to do?"" Luckily a manager was available, and he offered to ""move around some reservations."" Although the rooms weren't readily available to us, we were told to come back at 3:30. We were told this was the check in time, despite 3:00 listed on their website and in the reservation. Also, if you need to check in your bags, know the bell desk will not check in any coolers. I brought a soft case cooler with me with some drinks and snacks and had to lug it around until our room was ready.

Overall once we checked in we had a average experience. The year round pool was open, and heated. Restaurants Pink Taco, and Culinary Dropout were really enjoyable, affordable by Vegas standards, and it was nice to have good food options and not have to leave the hotel. The memorabilia throughout the grounds are with the stay. I recommend grabbing a cocktail, and taking a lap. If you do hit the strip, its a short cab ride, under $8.00.

Check out was easy, staff (with the exception of the front desk) were friendly. Avoid getting an wakeup call, ours never called us. Good thing we didn't have a flight to catch!

That and the usual rock star paraphanalia (the Johnny Cash display was really cool) makes this place a nice place to crash if you are in Vegas, and the rates are really really reasonable considering the size of the room. The Pink Taco is their signature Mexican restaurant, and folks come over form other resorts to eat there. Maybe its the name, right?

The 24 hour room service menu will satisfy anyone, and they have a great menu called ""The Morning After"", loaded full of hangover fixes.
There is loads of nightlife here, Body English nightclub and more. I might add that I hate Vegas (was here for family reasons) and hate the casinos, so my review is based on the Hotel, and the room and the food.

Since there's no real wall though, you can see someone in the bedroom area through the glass ceiling. Sometimes that can be.. An awkward thing. I love the inside of this hotel as well. It's just beautiful and really cool for musicians! They have multiple different pools so it was cool to have the different options.",5,2,4

They blast music by the pool all day long, planes fly by starting from 6am in the morning, the toilet didn't flush, the tv in my room couldn't turn off (had to call maintenance), nobody ever answers the phone at the front desk, I get a call at 3:30am (some dumb ass prostitute prolly dialed the wrong room number)... I've had a better experience staying at motel 6. For the crappy location, they don't make up for it in any way. All the conference attendees told me the casino here is a black hole. Nobody wins.

Thinking about the wristbands to Rehab that come with staying at their hotel, we all figured this place would be more than accommodating to our group of girls.   

Unfortunately they were the extreme opposite of that. We reserved 2 joining suites, however one wasn't ready and cleaned until the following morning after we checked in!!! (WTF?!)  Can you imagine 10 girls in one suite overnight????!!!

As if that wasn't bad enough, they freakin' still charged us for that suite stating that they had offered us an available suite on a different floor. ""Ok.. great, but that's NOT what we reserved a**holes!""  

And then management tried to redeem themselves by offering us one more wristband to Rehab.. but what good is that when we already had enough for our group..? (Of course we took that wristband anyway and sold it.. = P )

Anyhow, to sum it all up the customer service was extremely poor at this property.  Their front desk people didn't seem to know what they were doing!  Management handled our room dilemma with zero consideration of our bachelorette party plans.  The female manager insinuated that we were just trying to get out of paying for a one night stay.  She was full of it... not realizing we were ready and willing to drop some serious loot at their property.  Big mistake... 

It was evident that they devalue their guests simply because their business flourishes for being ""Hard Rock"", a world renowned name.  I plead with you all... NEVER stay at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.  There are plenty of beautiful properties in Vegas with way higher and exceptional customer service.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel to people who aren't looking to party; the crowd is younger and generally more of a drunken spectacle. The reason we stayed here was for the pool scene, which is the best in Vegas in my opinion. We went to rehab on one of the visits,  and while it was fun, it was overrated.

There are a lot of negative comments about cleanliness, location, service, wifi..I didn't have these problems really. Not everything can be on the strip, and there is a shuttle. Most casino hotels here have a tired feeling, some more than others. I didn't think HRH was that bad. I had two rooms, and both were clean. Beds are amazing! No problems with wifi. The speed was great. Service is a bit weird. Some front desk people definitely need to learn to smile. HR makes a point to have peppy, easy going people and some staff definitely lacked that but not all. I stayed in the HRH tower (Harmon) and the service desk down below (not registration) had no long lines. Love the toiletries too. I'd stay here again, though I might not make a point about it. I was here on business and I like to try a new one if possible. HRH is definitely better than NYNY. Only downside - I had my 9 month old so I needed a place for a bottle. I took two items out of the fridge for it and learned later that under no circumstance can I be refunded, and a fridge was $20 a day. Really? For babies I can't get refunded? Oh well. Lesson learned.

It's not a bad location, there's a bit to do and eat and see in the area. The pool is a destination in and of itself, and you never know what sort of improbable heels and barely covered bodies you'll see in the casino areas. Usually they're worth looking at, and won't require mental health assistance to recover from. 

The front desk staff are effective and friendly, although it can be hard to hear them over the loud music and casino noise. My last visit brought a free upgrade to a 2Q suite, which made it a much more enjoyable stay. The line can move slowly when it's crowded, especially when you're in line behind  people who have never checked into a hotel or used a credit card before. 

Speaking of which, the difference between the Casino Tower and the HRH Tower is night and day. Loved the huge bathroom with separate two-person tub and huge shower. Plenty of room to spread out, an iPod dock with touchscreen in the wall, two TVs, and pretty good wired and wireless Internet access. 

The room I had in the Casino Tower last year was okay, but felt a bit dark by comparison. 

On the downside, there's no in-room coffee (although you can get a small pot brought to your room for about $6 + $3 fee + 21% gratuity + 8% tax). The minibar and snack tray have sensors in them so if you pick up an item (i.e. to see what's in it, or what it costs), you get charged for it. I was warned in advance so I didn't have this problem, and I'm told the front desk can clear up accidental charges for the $25 two-condom pack. 

I only got refreshments at the coffee shop (Fuel, I guess) last time, but my most recent visit involved two breakfasts at Lucky's 24\/7, the (obviously) always-open diner. If you're alone, they suggest you sit at the counter, and service is intermittent. You'll eventually get served but it felt like I was in the way, although politely so. The coffee was mediocre at best, although the chocolate chip pancakes were very good. 

If you drive, the parking is copious and pretty easy to get around in. Note that parking in your tower's garage is going to be more convenient than just getting the first spot you can find. I parked one day in the Paradise structure and had to cross the whole hotel to get to my room in HRH. On the other hand, first day I parked in HRH and had to cross the whole hotel to get to registration. 

My work hotel choice is usually based on what's available at corporate rate when I book, so while I prefer our other hotel for non-upgraded rooms, I won't feel too bad about staying here, and I'll just try to get there early in the week and hope for a free upgrade.",0,0,0

Every time someone took a shower or washed their hands, the tub and sink got clogged and water took a long time to drown. Not to mention,we first came in to our room and the bathtub was already dirty. The hotel didn't even clean it. The soap was unused and unwrapped. Cleanliness was not a priority. We called twice to have it fixed and no one came to fix it. Also, we tried to call for help several times and no one answered the phone. As a hotel, they should ALWAYS have someone handling the phones. The customer service was horrible. When we finally got lucky and someone picked up, the ladies on the phone were rude with attitude. Exceptional customer service should be mandatory! If customers are extremely polite, there is NO reason to have attitude when answering a request. For a positive note, the pizza place in the casino was tasty and like mentioned earlier, the remodeled rooms looked great.

The hotel is not on the strip and getting a cab will set you back 10 bucks each way. The shuttle only drops you off at the north end of the strip, a bit of a walk away from all the action. And the shuttle only runs during the day until 5pm on top of every hour.

The walk to your room from the lobby to the Paradise tower is quite long.

Facing the pool area, the room does get a lot of exposure to the music that plays during the day until the evening. Not good for people who want to get some sleep during the day after a long night out.

No fridge in the room, you are explicitly told not to remove any items from the mini bar to store your own stuff.

Our room smelled of weed when we checked in. People smoke inside the hotel a lot, this may be offputting to some.

Booked the room two months in advance and when we showed up they told me it would be at least an extra hour to get a room unless we wanted to take a smoking room. Since I'm not that picky about the smoking room I begrudgingly took the room.  We booked a Poolview Paradise Tower room which is what they gave us... Sort of... More like a parking lot view room and you could sort of see the pools off to the left. This alone was not a dealbreaker but all the other little things added up.  Here's a great idea...if you tell me a room is ready, make sure it is.  We got to the room and there were no toiletries to be found...had to go find a maid and ask for them.  Mirror lighting was broken and toilet had no pressure...had to request they fix these things while we dined out...btw I had to go downstairs to make this request because the phone was also broken.  Then there's the shower... They need to put some sort of sweep or gasket on the shower because it leaked all over the floor including onto my luggage in the sink area.  The tv didn't work too well either...sometimes the picture would get pixelated, and other times the sound would remain from the previous channel or the thing would just plain freeze up.  Now we get to the pool situation... One of the main reasons we stayed here was to take advantage of the rehab pool party, which they told us would be open during the days we were there... Wrong answer! It was open for the remainder of the Sunday we arrived, but not the other four days we were there after that. We ended up going to the pool which was all ages but not the other four days we were there after that. We ended up going to the pool which was all ages.  If I wanted to hang out with a bunch of children I would go stay at Circus Circus. Anyway we were a bit disappointed with HRH and I don't think we will be back.  You guys need to quit letting the place fall apart and quit over booking rooms so that people can get in on time... I'm sure if I just decided to stay an extra hour you would not like it, so don't waste my hour when I show up on time to check in.

What irritated me:
-we didn't receive maid service two days in a row. So we came back after a long day and no towels were to be found. Both days we left early in the morning. I called and complained and was offered no compensation or explanation. 

-one of our sinks busted all over the counter and got all over my makeup and products since there's no drawer. A nice maintenance guy fixed it while we were still in bed. I've never had something like this happen at a hotel and once again no apology or offer to make it up to us. 

-the cost of taxis is not worth it to stay here

-booked for the pool. Be aware rehab is only open a few days a week. There was no hot tub and we felt bombarded by children at the one pool that was open. It also closes very early in the afternoon. 

-cocktail service is an absolute joke. We got our drinks about 20% of the time even though it's not busy at all down there. We can blow our money elsewhere at that rate. 

The good
-love the memorabilia around here. If it wasn't so far from the strip I would say come to see it because it's like a free museum.

Customer Service was excellent. Check in way easy. Good options for munchies and gambling, and great music playing at all times (always a plus).",1,0,0

Aside from that the rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  The main entryway is pretty busy and tight. I recommend parking in the Paradise   Lot which is close to the casino tower.  

I would stay here again, if I get a free room...

Instead of just hiring a lifeguard at that time, there's some thug outside who shoos you away from swimming because ""there's no lifeguard on duty.""

Came here for a friend's birthday.  Stayed on a Friday night in January and the rates weren't terrible.  I believe we paid $115 a night.

As has been mentioned, the rooms were very modern in design.  Note, not modernist.  ;)  Lots of black and silver, shiny surfaces...  (for the cocaine?)  Not really my taste, but I'm not holding that against them.  It was very slick looking and consistent.  Everything in the room seemed to be in good shape except for two of the outlets.  They didn't work at all.

We chose one of the rooms with a view of the pool.  By ""view of the pool"" they really meant - view of the pool if we hadn't planted about 20 trees in between.

Overall it's an ok place to stay if you are a rockstar or would like to be.  For me, it was a little too far from the strip (a mile) if you are a walker.  We took a lot of taxis so we wouldn't be drunk driving.  Also, from walking through the front doors to the elevators to the room is easily a 20 minute walk.  What the...!?  While it was cool walking past the cute tattoo guys, it KIND of sucks after you've been drinking for 6 hours and just want to pass out.

You would think that because it's off the strip that it would have to really focus on that to be successful.  The crowd is no longer hipsters or celebs but has turned into a more urban spot.  Especially friday and sat nights.  And the pool forget about it.  Don't go to the pool thinking you will see bikinis. If you go to the pool be sure to know you have to go through security and have an id even if you are staying at the hotel.  I'm not sure about other people but I don't like the idea of bringing my id to the pool and leaving it unattended while I go for a swim.  So then I have to ask myself why would I want to the pool and not swim.  But I guess that is the result of becoming urban with that comes a need to require id's.

I also got 4 free drink tickets at the bar (only used two) and a free dinner at Pink Taco inside the hotel. 

I checked in quickly and had a hassle free check out. That's about all I could ask for from the staff. My groupon also included some gambling credit, $50 I believe. The card they gave us wasn't activated properly and we were unable to solve the problem due to lack of staff the last night we were there. However, we found someone to help us when checking out, and wound up winning some money in video poker! So after saving a crapload of money through groupon, we won some back too.

2. There were what looked very much like blood stains on the wall, ceiling and curtain
3. The shower was COVERED in mold
4. I was majorly hassled twice by intimidating males - who wanted a resident to get them tickets for Rehab
5. I waited for 90 minutes to get my breakfast at culinary dropout
6. The shuttle service to the strip was WAY over subscribed

Pros:
1. THE BEST BEDS EVER! Like sleeping on a pillow. My bed now sucks.
2. Huge flat screen tv and reliable wifi
3. Pink Taco: the food was delish, portions were healthy, and the pom margarita was on point!
4. The artist memorabilia was really cool
5. It was far enough off the strip to not be a mad house
6. Liquor store across the street
7. Kaizen sushi across the street has the BEST roll - Kiss of Fire. Do it. Twice. I did.
8. Pauly D DJ'd there while I was there. I didn't get a jerz sighting, though. womp womp.
9. You can open the windows! A key in smoking rooms
10. About a block from the Double Down - my new favorite bar. Too bad it's all the way in Vegas.
11. Check in and out was a total breeze.

Cons:
1. The bathrooms were tiny. No double occupancy ever.
2. The pool has a dress code. For serious.
3. The pool also starts super loud, oontz oontz music, at like 11am. Shenanigans
4. Mr. Lucky's diner is not good. at all. Don't eat there.
5. Room service is also gross, but twice as expensive as Mr. Luckys.
6. The line for Starbucks was never less than 10 people deep.

On November 22, 2012, my husband, two tiny kids and I drove from Long Beach to Vegas for my nephew's wedding and stayed at the Hard Rock with huge group of family and friends.  We were there for one night and hustled to check out on the morning of November 23, the day of my nephew's wedding, to avoid any additional charges (ironic).  With members of our group as witnesses, we turned in our keys well before check-out time and then went on with the events of the day, driving home after the reception that night.  By January 2013, we had relocated our family to San Diego and closed out our bank account in Long Beach.  Meanwhile, Hard Rock waited until January 2013, THREE MONTHS LATER, to charge me for a nonexistent second night and, of course, their charge was declined.  I curiously watched as my credit score went from the 800s to the 600s, assuming that this was because I had stopped working full-time to stay at home with my kids.  

Fast forward to January of 2015.  Allied Collection calls me saying that I have an outstanding balance to Hard Rock for $110 for the night of the 23rd.  When I called Hard Rock's accounting department, speaking to Carol, she looked up the transactions from 2012 and apologized, stating that it was the their mistake.  I was then passed onto the manager of accounting, Maria Luciano.  After a lot of back and forth emails and a ""meeting with her management team,"" she inexplicably defended the decision to fraudulently charge me for a second night.  She acknowledged that I had physically checked out on the morning of the 23rd, but because somehow the wifi had been connected to in our old room on the night of the 23rd, they had reason to charge me for a second night.  Let's think of all of the scenarios where something like that could happen...someone in the neighboring room?, someone in the hallway?  the maid's iPhone?  I asked her, how a spontaneous connection to the room's wifi can override someone going to the front desk and checking out and then driving away in their car?  I asked her why her department didn't try contacting me by through the mail (we had our mail forwarded to San Diego) or cell phone or email for this ""outstanding balance"" before sending me to collections?  This would have given me a chance to fight this charge.  Predictably, I got a wall of silence in response...no returned phone calls, no returned emails.       

I even stated that if they would like to avoid taking this to small claims, I'd begrudgingly accept a free night's stay since I already paid for a night that was fraudulently charged to me.  Let's be honest, as a mom and wife and part-time worker, I hardly have time to deal with this stupidity.  But every time I think of it, I get angry again and it pushes me to do something.  I have started the process of taking them to small claims with the Las Vegas Justice Court.  Although it is a small amount of money, it's still my money!  And if it happened to me, it can happen to you and clearly, they think that they can get away with it.",2,0,0

The first time, I was randomly ""upgraded"" to a Casino Tower suite at check-in. Nice gesture, but describing that as a lateral move would be kind. I won't dwell on it since they're renovating the Casino Tower.

The second time, we were placed in the Paradise Tower, which was newer and cleaner. She thought the bathroom was too dark, so we asked about upgrading and got a fire-sale price on the HRH Tower. As other reviewers noted, these rooms are a little generic compared to the rest of the hotel, but they're bright, spacious, and comfortable, we had a good view of the Strip, and having a separate front desk and entrance was very cool.

On the upside, I consider classic rock and 80's metal playing everywhere I go to be a perk. Staff was generally helpful and upbeat, the casino was alright, and the pool and spa areas are done well. They have a selection of better restaurants such as Culinary Dropout as well as some good outside options right across the street.

On the downside, the front desk seems to take forever. The scene does attract a mixed crowd, and don't let anyone kid you about walking to the Strip.

The one complaint I have about this place is that I was hassled by a security guard as I was walking in the casino with my then girlfriend. Apparently, because we look young, we were carded. I didn't mind that. I had a problem with his attitude, and the fact he was accusing me and my lady of sneaking into the casino before he even looked at our ID's. He was literally being an A-hole for the sake of being an a-hole. He checks our ID's on the spot, then realizes he's wrong. So what does he do? Apologize right? Nope...he flicks the ID's back at us, and walks off with out saying a word.

- attended an incredible party for 3 days

The bad experiences:

- my friends went to the hospital because the bartenders were putting GHB in their drinks

Likes: 
The pool - great vibe if you want to drink and dance in the pool. Not great if you want to relax and sunbathe. The music is loud and the people are all over the place. 

The overall vibe: Very young vibe in the hotel. Guest are typically in their 20-30s and all have the same party attitude. Makes for a fun scene when you all are on the same page. 

Very comfortable bed! 

Hotel Service: I see some complaints about the service but I had a great experience. I had a gift sent to a room and the woman was very accommodating to my particular situation. The servers were very friendly and one waitress even gave our party of 8 a round of shots on the house. 

Music - Wasted Space, Vanity and Rehab all played a great mix of dancing music.  

Dislikes:
2 people per room get in free - the rest have to pay $20. Its worth it but is still a super lame policy. Plus they screen you better than TSA. The female security checked under my boobs before I entered. Wow. 

The room has a big mirror in the bathroom and a few mirrors on the bathroom door but only 1 outlet. Not the best set up if you are planning a girls trip and want to all get ready together. 

Bartender Service: At Wasted Space I ordered a cranberry vodka and basically got a glass of cranberry juice. I asked for a little splash more of vodka but the bartender said I would have to pay for an entire new drink. Then at Vanity I ordered 2 shots of Parton, about 15 minutes apart. I was charged $16 for one and $25 for the other - the EXACT same drink. These were my first two drinks of the evening so I was not drunk and over tipping. These people overcharged me and will not respond to my inquiries about why.

The only problem we had was the lighting, we wished it wasn't so dark. There was 3 of us girls trying to get ready in one bathroom. But other than that we loved it here. Thanks for the hospitality, we will be returning!

With one of my kids at UNLV, it is very convenient.  9 times out of 10 this place is a great place to stay.  Last night was one of the other times.  Tuesday night, they gave me a room next to the pool.  They had a private band that played until 11:30 pm, it was between 60 and 70 decibles in my room, on the 8th floor.  I get it, Vegas is a party town and I would have not had a problem on the weekend, but during the week, for a ""Private Party"".  I would have also been ok if they had told me when I checked in, and said ""here are some ear plugs.""  But noooo.  I called at 10:30 and asked if they could move me to the other side of the hotel, of course, there was no available rooms.  I asked why they didn't even warn me and I was told ""it was on the website for 2 months"", really, I guess I should do my homework.  

Previously, we were woken  up at 6 am on a Saturday morning with heavy construction going on litterally right out side of our window. 

It is too bad, too.  I typically like this hotel and casino.  Good restaurants (Culinary Drop Out and Pink Taco, skip Goose Island except for the beer), next room amenities, et.

Unter der Woche zahlt man auch gerne mal nur 25USD für ein Zimmer. Dazu kam noch ein Upgrade, weil wohl Zimmer frei waren, so dass wir gemütlich in der 20.

Alles nagelneu, richtig sauber, großzügig gestaltet, tolles Bad, super Matratzen, sehr guter Service. Da gab es echt wenig bis nichts auszusetzen.

Das Casino macht auch Spaß, aber ganz ehrlich... zentral ist es hier nicht und wer mehr Action will nimmt sich ein Taxi für 10 USD und fährt auf den Strip. Aber das kann ja jeder für dich entscheiden. 

Jedoch bietet das Hard Rock alles was man braucht. Wie so oft eine eigene Stadt in der Stadt. 
Tattoo gefällig. Geht hier 24\/7. 
Hunger? 24\/7.
Geld verzocken 24\/7.

Getränke gibt es während man am spielen ist, so oder so ""gratis"" dazu. Wer da den Überblick verliert, merkt dann schnell wie teuer so ein Getränk werden kann. Mit dem Pegel steigt die Spielfreude. Und so schnell kann man gar nicht schauen, da ist die Kohle auch schon weg. 

Aber sind wir mal ehrlich. Wer nach Vegas geht um Geld zu gewinnen, der hat schon verloren.

Also jeden Abend mit einer bestimmten Menge an Geld vor die Tür - Kreditkarte im Hotelsafe lassen und auf gehts. 
Dann kommen auch keine bösen Überraschungen morgens auf dem Heimweg.

Originally I booked the Corner King Suit in the HRH Tower but was later sent an email to upgrade to the King suit in the Casino and despite the reviews I read I went with it.

The bath tub had some stains and the toilet paper was as thin was less than 1 ply OUCH!!! We ended up getting our own. The Ac wasnt working to well I called the front desk no one came that was a bit upsetting but I didnt want to damper the mood so I let that slide.  There was a small minifridge which held about 6 bottels of water so we purchased our own cooler. Upon return we discovered that the bell service wouldn't take our things to the room because we had food causing us to make serval trips to ans from the car in the heat uggh!!

Comparisons - I've stayed at almost every hotel on the strip so I have an idea of what LV hotels are like. 
The positives the room is very nice, the bedding mattress and pillows are some of the nicest I've ever had in any hotel except maybe the Portofino Bay Hotel in Universal Orlando.  Big bathroom with double sinks. 

Negatives - No security keeping strangers out of room towers. Anyone can roam the floors with no security in site. Nobody checking that you at least have a room key before you enter the HRH tower. Also from the pool level anyone can access the rooms from the elevator on the second floor which should be card access only.  On the pool level inside the hotel there were unconscious teens spread out on the sofas. Not what I would expect to see. in the middle of a weekday afternoon. If you're staying here make sure to ask for the Paradise tower and not the HRH tower because it's a long walk across the entire hotel  and casino to get a cup of coffee.

It is really really far from the casino and the valet.  I'd hate to be drunk here. Who needs to pay for the use of a fitness center ( possibly $40) which I hear is amazing, it's a journey just getting to this tower and down the huge hallway. 

The room is a little weird.  No tub, only two towels and the mirror are either tinted or aged. They have a weird black ink swirl thing over the tinted mirrors.  Um. Did they not think women may want to do her makeup with them. Okay there is a magnifying mirror hanging on the wall,but that's not my thing.

Perhaps,I'll like the pool.  But I like service and amenities we are given one bar soap for the sink only.

My negative review starts after my stay had ended. I left three (very) mini dresses in the closet of my hotel room. As a paying customer I would have expected the hotel to ship the items back to me at little to no cost. Unfortunately, this was not the case when dealing with the Hard Rock. In fact, the hotel took complete advantage of the situation that I was in, knowing that I had no other choice. The hotel charged me $69.56 to ship the three SMALL dresses, $12 for them to package the dresses, charged me for insurance on the package and topped it all off with a hefty tax. Something that could have easily fit inside of a $10 flat rate shipping box, turned in to a $100 expense. I feel that the Hard Rock staff took advantage of me in this situation and capitalized on the fact that I had no other options.

The following reasons are why you should not stay at the Hard Rock...
1) SUPER dirty even after the cleaning people came it was GROSS! Visible dirt on the tiles in the bathroom, in the tub and around the sink. Stains on the sheets and the hallways stink of smoke
2) The pool management sucks! They wouldn't let us throw around a little nerf football around as ""it was a liability"" which is a joke as we have never had a problem at any oft he other hotels with throwing a football around but no not here.
3) The whole building is just run down even though they are doing renos the majority of the hotel is just old and stinks.
4) They gym sucks if your wanting to lift any amount of decent weight. Extremely limited supply of workout equipment.
5) Some of the staff has serious attitude (particularly the security at the pool) and that in itself is enough for us to never go back.
6) It's also off the strip and their shuttle service SUCKS! If you want a good hotel with a good shuttle stay at Palm's Place.
7) No kitchenette 
8) Line ups for check in and check out 

*the new side of the hotel I'm sure is much nicer than the old parts of the hotel but regardless if the cleaning people can't take care of the basics (mopping up dirt on tiles and cleaning a tub and sink) then it's just a matter of time before the whole hotel turns into a bacterial breeding ground.

The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the bed and pillows were nice. That's about it. I have a very long list of what went wrong for my fun 30th Birthday weekend.

First, most of the outlets in the room didn't work. There was no lights in the bathroom and the phone didn't work. Also, we had no toilet paper in the room and when we called to have them come fix everything and bring toilet paper. No one ever showed up. I had to go to the front desk and ask them to send us toilet paper. 

When it came time to dine at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast, it took about an hour and a half for our food to come. The customer service in this hotel was so bad. I couldn't believe it.

When it came time to go to the pool. The first made us get in line with everyone else. Then they told us guest had to use another door. We walked all the way across the casino to be told we had to go back and get wrist bands. Then we did and they wouldn't let us in that door with our bags of sunscreen. We asked the front desk what door hotel guest had to go to and they sent us to do door that was not letting anyone in the pool. Finally we find the right door after about 1 hour of trying to figure it out and by the time we go to the pool there was NO place to sit. They told us we could get a cabana for an additional $500. I asked for the manager and when the pool manager came over, I told him I wanted to speak with the hotel manager and he told me he couldn't call her. I had to get up, walk all the way across the casino again and wait about 30min to speak with her. She did give us $200 towards our cabana, but we still paid $300. I couldn't believe it. Although, Dino at the pool is AMAZING and he was the only one that felt bad about what was going on and took some stress off of us.

All in all, it was very stressful and everyone in my party was getting upset. We spent a good $10,000 on everything there and should never have been treated the way we were treated.

He had charged\/ given our card to a woman on the other side of the bar. Flag 1, he obviously didn't check the card as it was a mans name on the card.

Getting inside to the casino was another story.  There were heavily intoxicated folks blocking the doors and no staff at the hotel were around to take control and let people come in without being hassled.

Guests are charged a $5 'facility fee' per night when the only facilities that were open was the casino. The fee isn't financially significant (hotel is around $200 per night) but I found it psychologically crushing.

Hotels like the Hard Rock (I've stayed at a ton) tend to pride themselves on their service but the front desk staff (one in particular) were a bunch of absolute cocks. Seriously, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

It's not the cleanest place - toothpaste stain on the bathroom wall, loose hair on the shower wall, cigarette butts and garbage in the hallways. It's got paper thin walls so you can pretty much make out your neighbors' conversations as well as their bathroom visits.  We called the front desk about our neighbors that had kids screaming and running up and down the halls. We wanted a room far away but they instead offered to call them, which they did - we heard their phone ring after all.  The beds weren't that comfortable and there's a strong smell of weed in the hallways.

The tv's aren't in HD, or if they are something's not right because the picture isn't clear.  The drainage on the sink and bathtub are terrible too, took a good 10 minutes to clean the sink after shaving ie.  waiting for the water to drain.

Also note they have a policy preventing you from bringing in outside food\/drinks but never had a problem bringing water\/Coke to our room from outside.  The casino lacked any sort of ""buzz"" you might find at other casinos.

Oh and the wifi, part of the resort fee, is terrible. Can't watch a video on YouTube without buffering for a few minutes every 30 seconds.  No wifi outside of the rooms (ie. casino floor and restaurants).  We called for delayed checkout and were told to call back after 6am.

If your looking to get your money's worth in Vegas at a ""High-end"" hotel, avoid this place.  I was told something about their M.O. involved making their customers feel like ""Rock Stars"".  Total BS in my experience.

  Before I start, I heard this location went under new management or something, so be warned, it may have changed if you stayed there before.

  The rooms are really nice, building is pretty, and some people know what's going on, that's it for the good.  If you don't mind asking for a manager at every hinge, or know the way this place operates to avoid extra fees, go for it.  I was told of amenities in one email, and see separate charges on my receipt for it later.  I find out I have amenities like the spa after leaving when I heard from an employee it's $25 per person.  I go to the business center to make prints, copies, scans, emails and faxes and get charged $25, then find out the same services are complimentary at the concierge desk.  I get TONS of bark about their shuttle service, turns out it only holds 7 passengers.   Perhaps their 20 person vehicle was down since that's what the bell boys and rest of staff tells us they have (but don't know since nobody here knows what's going on, or cares), but if that's the case, don't make your customers be the ones to pay for your down services by having to get a cab because your hype is false.

  Seems the staff departments are not on the same page, you ask each department the same question (and in my opinion should be able to be found on a computer under your name), and they will either send you somewhere on the other side of the hotel, or give you a wrong answer, or give you a number your stuck on hold with for 20 mins, or simply be rude and not try to help.

  We visited 20 of the casinos in Vegas, walked thru, swam at some, gambled, drank, ate, took photos.  Most were great at treating you and didn't care that we weren't staying at their hotel, they knew if they treated you well, even without a tip, it would ensure their job, reviews, and a returning customer.  The great places of Vegas really do know how to shine.  Be sure to realize that when your there checking it out for yourself.  This place falls many steps short of those standards in my opinion.

  Also, I didn't care for the cold pools, most others at least have one pool that's heated.  HRH closes their pool way too early, who doesn't love night swimming! 

  I know how this hotel works in San Diego, and this Vegas one is totally on a lower scale.  Seems to me these Hotels need to work on meeting the same standard quick, I will never go back to this location until I hear about some major rework.  Perhaps it's the fact that there is too much work in Vegas and not enough worthwhile people to hire there, or the company is willing to hire those who only do the bare minimum, but this place is no Wynn, Belagio, or even Flamingo or Luxor.  This place is Motel Six with fancy looks and great elbow grease workers.  The place was clean, fancy and well kept by looks.  The people who deal with customers at the door and over the phone with bosses over shoulder or on camera with demand for good workmanship, are probably not part of my complaints.  But if you are the type to try to get the full value of your money and stay and a hotel, try digging deep here and you will see, you got a complaint, or question, they don't give a rip.  This place fails.  I definitely didn't feel like a ""Rock Star"".",3,1,1

I dont think that this Casino is nearly half as good as most of the casino's on the strip or even in downtown... but it is what it is, a passe idea of restaurants turned casino when most of the restaurants are bleh at best... I think this place is just another way to have money sucked out of your pocket...

Seriously when was the last time you went to a Hard Rock to buy a t-shirt to show you were in some far flung destination. Wasnt that so 20-25 years ago? I remember I was stoked to have a Hard Rock Bangkok t shirt 20 years ago! So yeah it seems likes its a totally dated idea. Some folks perhaps still ascribe to that setup, however, I dont know anyone who still does.

Overall this place had average at best customer service and friendliness. I wasnt impressed by the folks at the table games or who were on the floor. I asked 3 different people where the hard rock cafe was, and the first two didnt know or have a clue. I happened to be with three young ladies who wanted to eat there as their was a yelp check in deal. However unbeknownst to all of us, it was in a separate building. Sadly it took a while (3rd staff member) to tell us where the place was.

On top of that the table staff wasnt nearly half as friendly or outgoing as I normally find. This was at roulette and craps. Too bad since those are two of my favorite games and I wanted to gamble a bit. But when there is a lousy mood coming from the staff... who wants to spend money to be around that kinda crap.

It was clean. They had all the standard games and lots o slots. They have a giant hotel as well. But honestly, I couldnt care less and wont be back unless there is something special happening here that I HAVE to attend. My honest to goodness reaction is that it isnt worth 3 stars but i couldnt find anything specific to lower the grade on it for. It is just meh to the nth degree.",10,9,10

It's a very interesting property where many of the restaurants and shops are down hallways far away from the casino floor.  I felt like it I was walking through an older version of the Cosmo at some points.

My friends room was in the Paradise tower, I was curious why he was only on the second floor until I walked into the room, there was a patio with a TV & fireplace which exited out to a private pool which the 20 or so suites shared.  This by far was the coolest part of the room, although there were very high ceilings with mirrors on them.

I went to the lobby store and purchased a few snacks and was pleasantly surprised that they weren't marked up too bad.  I assumed that they would be since there were no prices, but I ended up paying $1.25\/bag for some corn nuts (not a bad deal).

But that may have more to do with all the wonderful ladies that traveled there to celebrate my cousin's birthday...or our friend that VIP'd us up everywhere.

Stayed in Tower One...the suite was beautiful with sitting area, kitchen, bedroom and a HUGE bathroom. 
I can so get down in this room...glass wall that separates the bathroom and bedroom?!  yeah, don't get me started ;0) ...two sinks, one regular shower head plus an overhead shower head, and a HUGE tub...YES!!
though gotta say not too thrilled about the frosty glass walls for the toilet...ehhh =\/
TIP: The main light switch is by the suite door, if you turn it off the bedroom and bathroom lights don't work either

Loved that all the workers we encountered were eager to help us get what we want.  We had everything right there at the Hard Rock so we never had to leave the hotel but I can see how it would be inconvenient if we wanted to go elsewhere.  

Went to Wasted Space, Vanity, Rare 120, and the opening of Rehab (I'll review them all separately).

Now I'm not totally ignorant...we were majority female (a Vegas plus), and like I said, we were VIP everywhere (another Vegas plus) so that may have influenced our service a bit but it's still Vegas, and it feels good to be taken care of here. =)

Upon check in the woman at the front desk said she would give us a ""comp upgrade"" to the pool view.  It was a little noisy and we were on the third floor, but this wasn't a problem since we never slept in pass the time the pool opened.  To get to floors three and above, you need to stick in your room key then remove than quickly press the floor number in the elevator..this is not good for those who are drunk, a little pointless indeed.

The room was pretty basic but clean.  Liked the French doors that opened up to a mini mini balcony.  The toiletries also smelled wonderful.  Wifi didn't reach my iPhone (reached my friend's galaxy tho)!  And on the last day when it finally did, it asked for my credit card info instead of saying free access.  First hotel I've stayed at on the strip where I've experienced this.  

The comforters are super thick, so stay here during winter!  I usually run cold, but my friends and I were so freaking hot when we were trying to sleep..even with the AC running on full blast.  Others make the location seem so far from the main strip, when it's not bad at all.  The most expensive cab ride one way to XS @ Encore the last night was only $11.  Maybe I'm spoiled too since I have friends that live there so I usually get rides, but, even just walking to a hotel a few doors down seems like a pilgrimage, so you're probably going to end up cabbing it most of the time to places anyways.

I say Hard Rock is not a bad option to stay at especially when you get a great rate like starting at $40 a night.  The main casino tower is where everything is at, but if you want to splurge a little bit there's two other towers that are a little fancier.

The Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas has changed a lot over the last few years.  When my husband and I first started going there about 10 years ago the clientele was sort of an odd mix of drunk frat boys on spring break and douchey bachelor parties contrasted with older hippie biker dudes (you know the kind with the leather vest and a long grey braid down their back) and their lady companions.  But we liked coming here as a break from the gaudy themed casinos with the overdone glitz and glamor. It was casual and laid back with just enough hard edge to scare away the families (why people bring their kids on vacation to Las Vegas I will never understand).

After the upgrades and expansion done in '08-'11 this is a very different place but still has that cool rock and roll feel that is trademark Hard Rock.  The rooms in the Paradise tower and the new suites are really luxurious and have all the bells and whistles we expect from a Vegas hotel.  Everything is shiny metal and black leather and velvet.  Very masculine but sexy at the same time.  I still prefer the more femininely pretty decor of the rooms in Paris or Bellagio but I just love the casino at Hard Rock.  It is now double the size it once was but it is still small enough that you can't get lost (sounds silly but that has happened to me in Cesar's more than once).  The Center Bar is still great for people watching and fantastic drinks when you are ready to take a break from the gambling.  Their concert venue, The Joint, is vastly improved from the way it was before.  No more folding metal chairs, this place has box seats and a kick-ass bar right in the venue.  They have also added more cool restaurants and hip shopping options and a fantastic salon and spa.  Their pool parties in the summer are legendary, they have a tattoo parlor on site, and a hot lingerie store... but none of that is really my thing.  But I do enjoy the restaurants on property and listening to some cool music while playing the slots.  Oh, and the other reviewers are not lying about how comfortable the beds are!

The new Hard Rock is really great option in Vegas if you want a luxury experience that does not feel pretentious.  If you consider yourself to be edgy (tattoos, piercings, in a band) then you will love it here but even if you aren't I guarantee that you will still be able to make yourself at home.",4,2,2

Besides, it's nice at the Hard Rock.  Our room, certainly reflective of its easy pricing, was cozy enough; and the colorful rock-n-roll memorabilia punctuated here and there throughout the hotel and casino invites one's playful sense of nostalgia to roam and to wonder at will.

The restaurants at Hard Rock weren't in our sights upon this shorter trip--buffets, instead, demanded our full ​attention (and they probably always will)--but who knows?  Maybe someday Hard Rock will introduce one of its own.  Nevertheless, for short, quick trips, we'll be back.",20,14,20

I was angry but I chose not to yell even though they didn't have their stuff together at all.  We had to wait until late evening until we were even able to get into our 2nd room!!! They ""compensated"" us with a late checkout. This wasn't enough based on all the crap we had to deal with. When we finally got our dirty second room, (which we supposedly had to wait for so they could clean it HA!!!) the key didn't even work!! I had to make about 5 trips down to the front desk trying to get everything taken care of. HORRIBLE!!!
 I stayed in the suites with the 2 queen beds. The sitting area, though separate from the bedroom, was pretty cramped. It was basically a normal sized bedroom with doors and a wall put up.
 The sound system wasn't very loud. The sound comes through the TV, or a little bedside radio. It did give you a variety of different stations and songs that you could play. You could also play your iPhone through it, so that I liked. 
    They had 2 of the 42"" flat screen TVS. One was in the ""living room"" and the other in the bedroom, but only one remote??! ""Hey honey can you run on in here and change the channel for me! Thanks!!!""
 The bathtubs looked nice but after seeing how housekeeping cleaned the rest of the suite I opted to not take a soak.
The beds were big fluffy and comfy. However in the 2nd Suite we could only sleep on one of the beds because the other had hairs on it! Guess that's why we had to wait till evening, so they could sprinkle dirt and crumbs on the couches and leave a helping of hairs on the beds. Oh they also thought it best not to wipe the brown stuff off of the walls in the toilet area. That was a lovely touch!! Couple that with the clumps of hair and dirt on the carpets and you have an award winning stay!!!
In the morning we ordered room service. There were 6 of us and our bill came to about $164.00. We paid for stale pastries and croissants, watery orange juice, cold bacon, cold pancakes, salt with a little bit of hash browns, sunny side up eggs instead of the scrambled eggs we asked for, sausage that looked like it was barely cooked, yogurt parfait, and chicken fried steak. They forgot our order of tea and the extra side of scrambled eggs we asked for. The coffee was however hot so yay for getting that one right!! The best part of it all is that we had to wait about an hour and half for our cold and disgusting breakfast!!!
They do have a great pool area though!
I would never want to stay there again. 

Resort Fee was about $20.00 and included wi-fi",1,0,0

Drake was playing and my friend and I wanted to see him perform, apparently they sold out 4 months ago within 15 minutes of having them on sale. I vote this the best place to stay thus far.

I was fairly disappointed because of the distance from the strip and doucey (sp?) Jersey Shore type vibe this place portrays.

I was pleasantly surprised...  Without holding the distance from the strip against them this is a nice hotel by Vegas standards.  Our room was in the new tower and although basic was big with an even bigger bathroom.  Seriously you could fit a queen sized bed in the shower.  Our room was also right above rehab.  While we didn't partake it made for some hilarious people watching.

The staff were friendly, helpful, and far from pretentious which was pretty refreshing considering the reputation I thought this hotel had.

Would I stay here again?  Probably not due to having to spend a small fortune cabbing it back and forth to the strip to meet up with friends(sure it's only a mile but when I'm only in Vegas for ~48hours my time is valuable).  The hotel itself exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family wanting a party themed hotel off the strip.",4,3,4

This was my first time staying at the Hard Rock but hey, we got a good deal and it's the Hard Rock, right?  ohhh.... so very wrong.

When we came to check in we had an oversized vehicle and pulled up to valet to unload bags\/check in. We asked valet where we could park and they directed us to self-park failing to mention that there was NO oversize parking. We creatively parked and were given a citation and directed to security. Why didn't they just say that in the first place??

Check-in,  lost our reservation and acted like it was our fault. Bags from valet took forever and yes, we had places to be and the tickets were in our bags!! 

The bed was amazing but something had to make up for the fact you were going to get woken up every 20 minutes by the f*ing AIRPLANES flying in for a landing. The worst 2 nights of sleep EVER.  The hotel is literally in the flight path and I was miserable.  This is NOT what I signed up for during a vacation and especially not after a night of vegas!   I am dead serious when I recommend that you map this place out in conjunction to the airport BEFORE you book!!

Food options were scant as most of the restaurants opened at times I had already eaten. Ate at Pink Taco, nothing to write home about, I have had better at any taco stand in LA. The beer option here was pathetic, there are several good Mexican beers but Pink Taco offers none of those. 

Rooms were OK as far as decor, there are many other hotels that far out-do Hard Rock (Treasure Island and Mirage to name a couple). The customer service was crap (If anyone else here says otherwise i would be concerned about their previous customer service episodes).

Upon arriving home we were oh-so surprised to learn that we had also been charged a $36 resort fee! I had booked online through travelocity and not once do I recall a reference to this fee. So now not only did the stay completely blow, they have ""gotten me"" for another $36 bucks.  I guess this is just Hard Rocks way to say farewell, forever. 

Save yourself and pay a few more bucks to stay on the strip, you'll end up spending that on cab fare back and forth anyway.",0,0,0

The hotel is nice and the staff is okay.  You must be wondering why the two star review then.

The biggest beef I have is their outside food policy.  I understand not being able to bring things in to a restaurant or concert venue but not have never been denied bring some snacks and drinks to my room.  I did know the policy going in but we wanted to stay the night there after a concert.  Below is the outside food policy and note that it excludes ALL food except medicine and a small cooler for kosher foods.

""In order to maintain a safe environment, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino prohibits coolers; boxes; bags; or other containers for the purpose of transporting food and beverage on property. In addition, all outside food and beverage is also prohibited."" 

The guy at the elevator searched everyone going up and I witnessed someone having an unwrapped candy bar taken away.  The guard really embarrassed the guy to and threatened to have him kicked off the property for violating the outside food policy.  

This is the reason I rate this place two stars.  It is their attitude not to allow you to bring any food or drink to your room. I would be okay with them restricting things but to exclude everything is insane.  I would have liked to bring some snacks and beverages like I do for every other hotel stay.",10,3,2

Let me count the reasons the Hard Rock is ""As good as it gets""!

 *Good action on the Poker room.  This is the ""go to"" spot for drunk tourists who think they know how to play.

*Lucky's is a good spot that's open 24\/7 with awesome Tuna Poki and breakfast.

*Pink Taco for a superior selection of tequila!  

*35 Steaks and Martinis-Best Ladies Comp Dinners!  They also do local\/industry deals on Monday

*Circle bar in the main on line casino.  This spot is great for people watching and ease dropping on your buddies on the other side of the bar. I do not know how, but the sound waves mysteriously carry and you can hear conversations of fellow patrons across the room.  

*Cool newly remodeled sports book and lounge.  

*Rehab within the summer. Arguably the very best Sunday pool party in Vegas that was made famous by the Reality TV show.  With real sand, a water slide,  pool table and beer pong games, swim up sexy blackjack dealers, lazy river, alcohol, grilled hotdogs\/hamburgers, and plenty of daybeds for sun bathing or cabanas for sports and shade from the sun you have it all!

*Body English Nightclub and  is my go to club on Sunday for the industry party. Open Champagne bar for women till midnight.  This is THE Industry party for afterhours on Friday\/Saturday with all the hosts, bartenders, cocktail girls ready to party after a long nights work.  

*The JOINT is one of my favorite live performance venues in Vegas.   Perfect size and there is not a bad seat in the place.  The suites are great too for large groups or hosting celebs.

One of my favorite events in Sin City is at the Hard Rock.  It's called  Dorm Days! It's an industry\/ locals sleep over that the Hard Rock hosts about twice a year and it's the BEST.  Book early to get a room on the party floors (tenth and eleventh) and stop by the Real World Suite after 2am for the real celebration.  Feel free to bring your favorite local DJ in and arrange turn tables in your room for an all night party. Did I mention the party in the suite is OPEN Bar.

Most importantly, if you plan on heavily utilizing the swimming pool, be sure to ask for a room near the Nirvana Pool. Otherwise, you will be trekking the long way through the casino floor in order to reach the sandy waters. The pools close very early and open late. My kids are swimmers and were disappointed when we had to leave the swimming pools before sundown.

The room was nice enough, but the refrigerator was stocked full of sundries we never used. It would have been great to have someplace to store all of the leftovers from the big portions of food. It would be great, also, if the rooms did not have the obnoxious sensor-filled displays of goodies like $8 candy and $5 waters. They really ruin the chic decor of Hard Rock's hotel rooms.

The dining at HRH was great. We ordered room service one night and it arrived fast. The next, Fú did not disappoint with Asian cuisine. Finally, Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 had good eats at a decent price, but the real win was getting breakfast anytime.

You walk in and the first thing you see are signs telling you that you can't bring outside food or beverages. It's a hotel, not a restaurant and I'm not paying $8 for your bottled water (tap water is undrinkable here it tasted like pool water). These signs are EVERYWHERE and very unfriendly.

They've adopted the ""resort fee"" scam. I'm not even going to waste time ranting about that outrage, it's not as if they don't know how furious these make customers. Resort fees should be illegal, they're just an excuse to LIE about the rates.

The TV is garbage. Half the channels aren't even in HD and the set frequently freezes up just from trying to change the channel. 

Our room had a fantastic view of the parking garage...for the same price as a room with a REAL view. 

Thin, scratchy towels with rips and tears. A mini bar that charges you INSTANTLY if you accidentally touch something without even picking it up, forcing you to argue about it. And the food items on the mini bar are past expiration date! Lousy climate control. Dirt EVERYWHERE. Broken lights. Toothpaste crust in the sink. Terrible WIFI. This place is awful.

3 days of relaxing (oxymoron for vegas right) and fun was just what I needed at the time.
While I do admit vegas isn't exactly my cup tea the hard rock was fun.  Our room was slightly upgraded because once we arrived for check-in it wasn't available. So we were totally happy about that.  
The ReHab pool was great but overrated if you asked me.  I preferred the other family pools around.  Also, it would have been nice to have a bar in the pool.  Maybe that's something they can invest in ;)

- Friends' recommendation
- Price
- Interest in on-site shows
It was an interesting experience, but I wouldn't go back.  And here's why...

The Good:
The Hard Rock Casino\/Hotel is made up of three towers, the casino, two clubs\/event areas (Joint and Rogue), bars (Skybar, Vanity), and a handful of restaurants (Johnny Smalls, Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's 24\/7, Nobu, Rare 120, Ago).  There's also an on-site tattoo parlor, a couple of 'rock shops', three pools, Reliquary (Spa) and the RockSpa (gym).  This means that there are a variety of options to explore and you can (if you're interested) stay there without needing to leave. 

We stayed in the Casino tower in a standard room that looked out over the pool, and it was perfectly nice.  The art is photographs of rockers (in our room, Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix), the furniture is very modern, the bed is very soft, and you get four huge kingsized pillows.  As mentioned, the blackout shades are fantastic - you can definitely ignore the world if you need to.

The pools are well-designed; a combination of a beach\/spa\/tropical sort of feel.  There is swim-up gambling, lots of waitresses to get you drinks from the bar, and the bar itself is really fast (perfect to grab a drink and run). (NOTE - a double jack and coke?  $22.)

We saw a show at the Joint, the event venue, and it was fantastic.  They only allow in 4000 people, which means just about anywhere you are, you can see\/feel\/hear the band perfectly.

We ate at Nobu and at Ago.  In both places, the waitstaff were extremely welcoming, friendly, and warm.  The food was delicious, especially at Nobu, and we had no trouble moving our reservations around to accommodate our show-tickets.

The Bad:  The whole place, other than the rooms, smells like smoke.  The ventilation is awful, especially in the hallways walking from tower to towner, or to the restaurants.  The inside is kept overly cold; even though it was 100+ outside, they kept it in the 60s indoors, so it was really hard to go from place to place and be 'dressed right'.  You'd think, with the encouragement in Vegas to wear as little as possible, that this wouldn't have been an issue.

The lighting in the rooms is awful.  Its hard to put on makeup in that lighting.

Gambling is not a priority at the Hard Rock.  We'd originally planned to enter one of the morning poker tournaments, but the total number of people participating varied between 3-5; we may as well have played in our room together and saved the money.  As a result of the lack of emphasis on gambling, the casino is pretty dead except from midnight - 2amish.  Which is a drag.

There is only one restaurant to get breakfast.  The 24\/7, which serves diner food.  Otherwise, you either get Starbucks and skip it all together.  Similarly, if you want something to eat after ~10pm on a weekday?  Its the 24\/7 or nothing.  Yes, you can stop by Fuel (the convenient store) if you want a power bar.  But again, the lack of choices is just sort of a bummer when you're looking for a 'vegas experience'.

During the day, its a bit of a drag.  Unlike the other casinos (e.g. Mandalay Bay, MGM, etc) there are no shows or events to do during the week.  If you're not out by the pool, then... you're probably passed out.  Because seriously, there's nothing.  

Finally, the pool scene is ridiculous.  You can't bring any beverages in, even water or your morning iced latte.  The first time I realized this, I had to throw out the coffee I'd literally just bought.  I get that they want people to buy pool drinks, but that's over the top in my opinion.  You also can't bring in bags\/backpacks, so forget about bringing your iPod to listen to tunes or your Kindle to do a little reading.  It'll get lost\/stolen\/destroyed.  During the week (when its less busy), the Rehab pool is closed; you can only use the Casino pool, which (as a result) becomes really crowded.  You also can't use the beds\/white poufs unless you meet the drink\/spending minimum (~$100) which means there's perfectly good seating that can't be used.  On Saturday and Sunday (when the AM SKRAM and Rehab are going), you are searched and have to stand in line to even go out by the pool at all.  Its a huge hassle.  And the people you're interacting with, 99.9% of the time, are already hammered.  People start drinking at 10am (when the pool opens) and continue all day.  So there's no filter... there's no courtesy.  Its pretty gross.

Summary - I realize I probably come off as an old person (I'm not - I'm 30) in this review, but all told, this resort was not for me.  Much as I loved Nobu and seeing Coheed at the Joint, I could just as easily have done that and stayed somewhere nicer\/with more to do.  There wasn't anything about staying at the HRH that made me want to come bac",2,1,0

Our room was clean and spacious but there were a few lights in our room that were not working. We were a group of three girls and I must say that it was difficult to get ready for the day\/night because all of the mirrors were in one corner of the room. AWKWARD!

The decor was pretty cute, the beds were amazing\/very comfortable, shower was heavenly, and all of the staff we encountered was pleasant. I will say that the only reason decided to  book at the HRH is because we were told that we get up to four complimentary tickets to Rehab; upon check-in we quickly learned that is not the case! They will only give you rehab tickets at a discounted rate but($28 for the first 2 and $33 or $35 for the third and fourth tickets) it totally isn't worth it if you are a girl because you can pretty much get into ANY pool party for free by getting on the guest list.

As far as the actual hotel lobby\/casino..I really like how they have the actual outfits that musical artists have worn during some of their most popular performances. It was very cool to see..and the excitement stopped there for me.",4,0,0

We saw  a deal on Slick deals for $30 per night and we jumped on it - I've never been to the Hard Rock and I didn't have high expectations for a room that was only $30 a night. Boy, was I wrong. 

We got to stay in HRH and we were so confused when they told us we have a private entrance. But it was amazing- it's a private entrance to the parking lot and the guest elevators, the reception was fantastic and the room was the. best. thing. ever. I was expecting a matchstick room, but it had its own living room, two TVs, and in-room sound system. I wanted to stay swathed in their down comforter forever. 

The casino and hotel itself is always in top party mode, but never too crowded where I feel stifled and paranoid but just enough where it's super fun. It's the perfect mixture of relaxation and fun. The HRH suites are never loud and actually gives you a great amount of privacy. 

Rehab was a little problematic. This was my first time to these kinds of pools in Vegas -- I came too late in the afternoon to grab one of the very, very few recliners and I didn't even want to think about the cabanas. I didn't know where to leave my stuff while in the pool, either. The pool itself is great, great music and atmosphere and not too crowded if you're cool with just lounging in the pool. 

The one tiny problem was-and it wasn't entirely their fault either-how they took the deposit. The rooms were only $30\/ night but they withdrew the $250 regular price of the room from our accounts (per night) which put a huge dent on how much we can spend. I guess next time we just have to prepare the accounts better. 

Despite being off the strip, it's only a $9 cab ride to the main attractions. I would pay that to get away from the hectic Strip atmosphere -- overall, I would definitely come back again (hopefully with this deal). The people are super nice, Mr. Lucky is delicious, the rooms are great, the pool's amazing.",0,0,0

That was not sweet after I have traveled this long!  I called Groupon for customer service but they were closed so there was nothing I could do on my part too.  

I was so tired....  I asked if any room is available and I'll just take the room with my credit card thinking they don't charge me yet and groupon can help me solve this the next day.  I had the receipt.    

Then the staff helped me get the room at the $59 per room rate plus tax instead of using Groupon.  
Which was nice.   More nice was he gave me the 11th floor room.  The view was superb. 

All relieved, I  checked in and went to the room.  I could tell that this side of the building was very old but I give good rating to the cleaning lady; she had good vibes and 5 stars to such a comfortable bed!    

When I went to the counter for check-out, the balance showed $130 plus tax, and resort fee of $22 plus tax.  

The staff told me that,  this is all he can see in the computer, there is no note for the change of room rate, after I told him everything what happened at the check-in.  

There was no sign of compassion, no sign of understanding.  

I felt sad.  

He went to speak to a female manager and all she tells me is the same thing. 

I told him the name of the person who checked me in and asked them repeatedly to give him a call.  She said that the staff sees many people a day so no one really remembers.  But I insisted that because this involved a certain senario that he must remember about me.  She gave in.  

They seemed to got hold of him or something and perhaps found out that I was telling the truth that she came back from the back saying she subtracted the amount from the total balance.

There was no apology, nothing from both the manager and the staff.  

Not only that, when I checked out, there was unknown resort fee of $22 plus tax each night.  

Again, I told the guy at the checkout, there was nothing said about the resort fees, if I had known, he could have shown me what it was about and what service is included in the fees so I could have enjoyed them.   Again there was no explanation at check-in.    

He said, well you signed it.  
I am like where?

He said when I signed on credit card machine to allow the hotel to hold $59 for security deposit.  

And the guy said he must have told you twice about the resort fees, as if it's the rule of the hotel.  But the truth is he never did.

So again, I told him, no I never heard anything about it.

He repeated himself again, he needs to tell you this so you must have heard.

What's going on?  It's not the hotel policy that I want to hear.  

Are they not aware that all we need is their understanding and compassion?      

This was a great example how so many people are operating from the head and do not really know how to connect to people's heart.  

Would I ever go back there?  

Even if the cleaning lady was nice, bed was comfortable,

For half off the stay, how could I not have chosen the Hard Rock? Yes, it's a nice jaunt to the Strip (but we did it twice). Yes, the food choices here are a hit-and-miss. And YES, trying to find the HRH Towers check-in was something akin to Indiana Jones' search for the Holy Grail. However, once I did find it and prepped my feet for the walking (and then my wallet for the cab fare once my feet gave out), I really enjoyed my time here. The bathroom was probably my favorite part of the room.... HUGE shower with two showerheads, spa-sized tub (which I didn't get to use, boo!) and of course, ALL open and perfectly viewable by the entire room (lovely when you're there with a lov-ahh). My lov-ahh's favorite part of the room was easily the bed... big and fluffy, huge pillows and enough room for us both to stretch out.
I unfortunately was not able to use the pool nearly as much as I was hoping to (go figure that the week we stay there, Vegas is hit with freak weather). The one day I was able to go lay out, I was digging the pool layout. The Relax party was going on in a different area, but the music was very audible where I was laying... so I was able to bask in the sun (while it was there) and listen to some pretty decent mash-ups. 
Would I come back and pay full-price? As long as the damn sun promises to show up!!!",0,0,0

A ridiculous amount of space in our 2 bedroom, dual sink and shower bathroom. My girl friend and I were here for a weekend get away and I have to say we could have easily fit 4 people in this room and still had plenty of room. 
In comparison to the Linq where we stayed this spring, this room is at least 2x bigger. While the Linq is in a perfect position to the strip, we took a $6 uber to get where we needed to from the Hard Rock. And I'm pretty sure we paid about the same price.
The bar downstairs is decently priced and the drinks are good. But Pink Taco.. OMG. Food was bomb, but the Berry Mojito was delish! 
My only complaint..... this is the worlds smallest casino floor... ok.. it's not a complaint because I'm not one to gamble but if I was with my husband he would have been really disappointed in how small the casino floor was. But if you're like me and not one for gambling, perfect spot!

The bed was comfy, the staff was accommodating when I called late at night asking for non-down pillows, and the wifi in the rooms and conference center worked well once I figured out how to use it.

Still, I don't think I'd recommend the Hard Rock just because of its off-the-strip location. If you're headed off the strip, though, and the Hard Rock has competitive pricing, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just can't imagine having a reason to stay here.

I don't even care about the planes overhead or the music - um, it's Vegas, people! So why only 3 stars? We only had power in half of our suite, with only one dim light in the very large bathroom.

Seriously, it's too cold to use the pool, the internet doesn't work and we only have one light that does. Why should we pay ANY resort fee, not to mention we should get some sort of incentive because of no lights and crap connectivity.

The lights didn't work in the shower and we couldn't hook up our iPhone 5s to the sound system in the room so that was a bummer but we still liked the set up. 

The pools could be nice b\/c they are huge and there are different styles - like one with a sandy bottom, waterfalls, and islands to hang out on. But they are so gross b\/c there are way too many people there and it's nasty when you think about what is floating around in there (fecal matter comes to mind - ewwwww!). The worst part about that is you can actually see a bunch of nastiness floating in the pool - oil, what looks to be skin, and hair. It really freaks me out but we knew going there the Hard Rock is known for their party atmosphere especially poolside. In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b\/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. 

Mr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate. The eggs were chewy and inedible and they even messed up the English muffin. Seriously how do you do that? Plus it was pricey for shitty food. I was most upset that I wasted valuable stomach space but I didn't eat much. I spent $20 for breakfast and was only able to stomach an eighth of it. Wasteful but it was truly one of the worst meals I ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother eating there.

Fu - we had dinner here one night and none of us was impressed. I guess I had high expectations and was very excited for ""Chinese"" food but it wasn't good. Out of 4 of us, 1 person liked their meal. The staff was friendly though and the meal wasn't horrible it just wasn't what we were hoping for. 

Culinary Dropout: This is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have the best staff - so much fun. We loved our servers and went here 3 times in 2 days! Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. 

The Joint: I love this venue b\/c it's small and the set up is cool b\/c everyone has a good seat plus is you want to go to the bar you can still see the stage. Overall, we had a good experience but I would only stay here again if I was going to a show at the Joint b\/c it's too far from the strip which limits my feeding choices :O)",0,1,0

Here were the pros: friendly staff including check-in and room service, hospitality (quick check-in and they fulfilled a special request to have a fridge in my hotel room), good selection of restaurants (namely Nobu), the Reliquary spa (so good that i went there two days in a row). 

Here are the cons: not walking distance to the strip (so you feel incredibly isolated), although i had a positive experience with check-in a lot of my coworkers did not, some of the pools were closed during the week, the rooms had very poor lighting in the bathroom (i couldn't find a good place to do my makeup), the full length mirrors had some black\/grey decorative etching on them so they weren't practical, the lighting was so dim near the wardrobe that i had to use the flashlight on my phone to check the shelves to make sure i didn't leave anything behind, the casino floor employees were rude, the decor is in bad need of updating, the bathroom sink wasn't wiped down two days in a row, wifi signal was poor, and the whole hotel just did not smell pleasant.

While it's definitely not the worst hotel I've stayed at on the strip, I don't necessarily think it would be my top choice if and when I go back.

**STAFF**
Most of the staff are pretty friendly and helpful, which makes everything easier and stress free. If I had a question, needed a cab, or needed to be directed some place specific, they had an answer. The only thing that was kind of annoying was my friend was given this weak drink at the poolside bar, and the bartender told her boyfriend to get her ""white girl wasted.""

**FOOD**
The restaurants in the hotel are pretty good as well. The tapas bar, Johnny Smalls, has an awesome pull pork slider, as well as an amazing grilled PB&J sandwich. All of their dishes are small, so it's definitely recommended to do an ""all you can eat"" option for $25. Lucky's Diner. Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 diner is not too bad of a place; everything seems pretty well prepared. I will say this though, after about an hour of eating and heading back up to the room, I had a very upset stomach, and I'm going to assume it was from the food I got at Lucky's. It tastes good, but it's not too great going down.

**ROOM**
The room itself is not too shabby. I got poolside view, and while it is a nice view, the noise level can get really intense. Thankfully I wasn't in the room during the middle of the day, but dropping in to change, I can hear the DJ (which to be honest wasn't that great), and the level of raucousness. The beds are amazingly comfortable. The bathroom is a joke; the toilet sounds like a groaning space machine, and the bathtub is small and cramped. The room, however, was VERY clean, which is a huge plus.

**CROWD**
I'm not a huge fan of the ""Bro"" crowd, so I chose the wrong hotel to stay at. If you're not a fan of young adult men and women falling over each other and purposefully getting hammered in order to ""sin in sin city,"" then you should probably check out some other hotel. It's not so much that people are trying to impress everyone, it's more that they're trying to show that their standards are pretty low, and all they want is a lay for the night, regardless of the quality. Then again, that's the reason why this hotel is specifically geared towards those who are 21+, so expect a bit of crazy drunkenness and over flirtation from a lot of people.

**TRANSPORTATION**
Hard Rock provides trams that take you to the strip every hour, and the cab ride isn't too bad either, but it's a definite ways away walking distance. The location isn't much of a problem if you're willing to wait for a ride or take a taxi, but if you do, then it'll probably be out of the way for you. It's literally minutes away from the airport, which is nice.

This place doesnt win the catergory for price, food, size or decor, but its personality and the crowd add great value. The casino sets a great mood with rock playing while dancers in skimpy outfits do their thing next to the craps table. Upon entering this place I truly felt I was in VEGAS! Its nightclub Body English was really great (attended a wednesday nite house music party.) The pool is the main attraction here, tho i missed its Sunday Rehab party, I found the monday Relax party to be a great experience. Drinks were no bargain but free entrance for staying at the hotel helped offset this. The simple reason you can lure talent up to your room in under a minute from the pool is reason enough to make sure you stay here, the simple yet clean decor in each room adds to the value. The casino is full of young girls who are looking for a good time and the staff at this casino was better then almost anywhere else I went on the strip, from dealer to front desk to room attendants, everyone had a nice friendly attitude.

It is way off the strip so that is to be noted.

The Hard Rock will always be the hard rock. It is catered to a younger crowd and loud music plays non-stop. There's no shortage of groups of males walking around scoping out the ladies. 

The room itself:

I was put in the Paradise Tower and told at check-in that a King wasn't available so I'd get a queen. There was also a mention of a $15 resort fee. I asked if it included wifi as other hotels on the strip include that as part of the fee. I was told that it did not and wifi was additional. When pressed what the resort fee covered, I was told ""amenities, such as free parking and the gym"". So basically, the 'cheap' room rate just skyrocketed.

The rooms are quite a bit back from the actual 'lobby'. Just be warned that if you have lots of luggage, you will be walking quite a ways. 

My room was on the 14th floor and overlooked the parking lot. The first thing I noticed is the scruff marks on the door as well as on the walls. The room also smelled musty and the AC wasn't on. The halls have a smoky smell lingering from all the other guests. 

The bed itself seems very comfortable and the toiletries don't seem so bad. The lights by the bed won't work though which is interesting. There is one lamp by the TV which seems to work. 

Other reviewers mentioned the pool being restrictive and it definitely is. They have a security guard who stands out front of it and big signs enforcing their ""rules"". They also have signs in the lobby noting their dress code after 8pm. Seems a bit much for me and way off the strip.",0,0,0

Self-parking for check-in is a breeze. Stop trying to find a space on level 1 and go up a few so that you can park right next to an elevator. 

Check-in was slow and laborious. I can't believe in 2013 people still have to clack a thousand and one keys to confirm the reservation I already paid 50% of online. There should be a service where you can book a specific room online, show up with your credit card, slide it in the lock and BOOM you're in. Who wants to deal with some chipper chick doing her worst to get you checked in fast after a 5 hour drive to Vegas? 

The rooms are decent. At least, ours was. I'm sure they get better. We had a pretty good view of some mountains. It's not like you're getting a strip view anywhere here, so might as well just get whatever is available for the right price. The mini bar and counter bar are scary because if you even knock something out of it by accident you're charged automatically. And, yes, the prices are grossly inflated. 

The bathrooms blow. Our sink, which I thought was cool because it had a super deep basin, was not cool because that super deep basin filled up every time we used it. Ditto on the shower, which at one point filled so much I might as well have taken a bath. Plus, how the hell am I supposed to wash myself AND pee in the shower when it's up to my calves? Seriously, guys. 

I liked their sexually suggestive door hangers - turn it to ""Tied Up"" if you don't want the maid. Which we did, often. But she still came anyway. I assume they just ignore them. 

As I said, between Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's 24\/7, Culinary Dropout and whatever else you come across this hotel has some good foodstuffs. And clearly at least one of them is open 24 hours. 

The fitness center was closed for AVN Awards (No, I did not go because I arrived the day after it occurred. Yes, that did upset me.), so I got directed up to the cardio room. Which is exactly that - a room full of cardio eq. Of course, since the gym was temporarily closed I was welcome to use the spa's gym facility... for a reduced-from-$25-a-day, $10\/day fee. So, had their own gym been open it's free, but since it isn't I get to pay a reduced fee of $10? Well, fuck me, isn't that a deal?

Check out didn't work on my TV for whatever reason. Luckily, doing it down at the lobby is a breeze. No hassle or waiting or whatever. Why can't they make it this easy to get into the place?",3,7,2

This was only my second time in Vegas being over 21, so I don't have many rooms to compare it to, but I loved it here! 

Check in was at 3. We got to the front desk around 3:10 and waited 15 minutes in line. Check in was easy. I made my reservation on Priceline and didn't have a room type assigned. I called ahead to get a non smoking King room requested. At check in, they told me they didn't have any rooms with Kings ready so I can wait either 30 mins to an hour for that room or go straight into a room with two queens. My boyfriend and I were hungry, so waiting wasn't too bad. They said we'd get a call when our room was ready.... 
We went to eat at Pink Taco (YUMMY) while we waited. We waited 30 mins... 45 mins... An hour... An hour and 15 mins later we just went to the front desk to ask if the room was ready and it was. We never got the call- oh well. 

The room was NICE. We were on the 11th floor in the Casino Tower. For the $45 I paid a night, I can't complain. (There's a $22 per night resort fee, but all hotels have something around that much so whatever) Like everyone else was saying, the bed is sooo comfy. The decor in the room is what you'd expect at the Hard Rock. All black and white with band pictures on the walls (We had Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles). TV was huge. Didn't watch it much, but it was decent when we used it. Everything on the mini bar is on a scale so if you touch something and don't use it, you pay for it. 
Room has all the standards in in EXCEPT a coffee maker but that's no biggie. Go to Starbucks, you'll live. 

Bathroom was nice as well. I had read reviews that the sink and shower drain really slow. Mine were ok. Shower was a little slow but nothing to complain about, it's not like the water was up to my ankles or anything. Maybe I just got lucky with my room. 
Another pro: late check out till noon is free. We were running late with showers and getting ready the day of check out, I called and asked for some shampoos while my boyfriend was showering. They came up with a BAG of items. Shower caps, a dental kit, mouthwash, toothpaste, body wash, extra body bars, facial bars, a beauty lot with q-tips, shaving cream. Every. Thing. It was a nice touch. 

One star was taken off for the distance from the strip (we had a car but it was still kinda far and we got lost and went down a one way road in the wrong direction one night- oops.) and for the front desk dropping the ball and making us wait too long for our room.

Gina M. and I stayed here, and it was one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The room sports black walls, and I you look closely at the white designs on the walls, you will notice that they are skulls. The rooms aren't all dark though, as the ceiling and beds are white, so don't expect to be fully 'gothed' out. The view from our window - in the Paradise Tower - gave us an incredible look at the Las Vegas strip, as well the many pools below. Finally, the bathroom area is the most Rockstar thing in the whole room, especially the shower. It's a full glass, walk in shower, and it's HUGE. The door swings both ways, which I thought was amazing, and the shower is ground level with only a small step to keep the water inside. 

A few of the pools at the Hard Rock are exclusive, but the Nirvana pool - named for the state of mind, not the band - is open to all. They have complimentary towels for you to use, and bins to discard them in when you're done. They have security checking everybody going into the pool to make sure they are staying at the hotel, so be sure to have your room key with you. The Nirvana pool may not be exclusive, but it's nonetheless amazing. One side of the pool is modeled after a beach, so it's covered in sand on the bottom, with lounge chairs sitting in the sand. The other side of the pool is more like a real pool, and it's deeper than the beach one. They have two lifeguards on duty, one for each side of the pool. 

Checking into the hotel was a bit of a hassle, mostly because we couldn't find the right check in line to be in. When we did make it to the right line, it took us thirty minutes to check in. 

They do have a lot of shops, places to eat, and even one tattoo shop open to the public.

Last week I took the Nevada Bar Exam, which is a 15  1\/2 hour exam administered at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I called the University to ask for a recommendation for a hotel during my stay--they pointed me toward the Hard Rock. I paid $100.00 a night to stay there expecting the benefits that come with a nice hotel. I was unable to check in until 3:00 p.m. on the day of my arrival. However, I was told that should a room become available earlier I would be charged a fee (I think $13.00) if I wanted to check in early. 
      While it is not the hotel's fault, I am not a smoker and I started to get a sore throat from the cigarette smoke.  I wanted to heat up some water in my hotel room, but I realized that I did not have a hot water pot or coffeemaker. I asked the front desk if I could please have a coffeemaker, and I was told that they were removed from all of the local hotels and one would not be provided. I asked how I could get hot water and I was told that I could purchase a cup from room service for $4.52....for a cup of hot water! Plus tip, $5.52 a cup. After being told this, I inquired with other test takers staying at nearby hotels, and despite Hard Rock's portrayal of a systematic removal of coffeemakers throughout Las Vegas, it turns out that the hotel down the street, LVH provided their guest with Keurigs in each room--and they only charge $30 per night.  Additionally, the nearby Holiday Inn also provided coffeepots to their guests. To add insult to injury, the last morning that I stayed it the hotel my room smelled like smoke when I got up in the morning.
       Additionally, I was placed in a room that overlooked the roof of a lower level. While the view was not pretty, that didn't really matter. The issue that I had was that there were several fans or air conditioning units that created a buzz in the room. Again, I went down to the front desk not looking to change rooms, but to ask for earplugs. I was told that if I wanted earplugs I would need to go buy them from the convenience store in the Hard Rock. On the last day I asked for a late checkout, so that I could take my exam which ran from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., I was told that if I wanted that late of a checkout that I would need to pay an additional fee, and furthermore no rooms were available. 
     While these may seem like relatively minor events they added a huge stress to an already intense week. Particularly, the fact that for four days I was unable to get any hot drinking water. In Las Vegas where there are a vast number of hotels to choose from, what sets a hotel apart is the customer service, which is beyond lacking at the Hard Rock. I do not recommend wasting your money at this ""nice"" hotel, because they will nickel and dime you at every turn, and for individuals who are visiting Las Vegas for pleasure rather than business, it does not even have the added benefit of being located on the strip.",3,0,0

Reasons why:
1. Air conditioning did not work. On the highest setting, we were still too hot (and not the good kind of hot).
2. NO COUNTERS in the bathrooms!!! Really? Seriously? No counters? That's what we all said. We has to rest our things on top of the toilet and on the floor. Ridiculous!
3. Shower had no tub and was like the ones on a cruise. Nothing to contain the water. Just a curtain. The bathroom flooded so many times and we had to ask for so many towels to create our own barrier between the shower and the rest of the bathroom.
4. Only 1 chair. We had to get ready while sitting cross-legged on the floor. Or, stand in the bathroom and constantly bend down to the floor to reach our things (you know..because there's no counters).
5. Away from the strip. Be prepared to spend a lot on taxi rides.

We only stayed here because we thought it'd be easier to get into Rehab. Well, apparently they recently changed the rules on that. You only get wristbands into Rehab if you booked the room directly through them. Since we booked through Expedia, we didn't even qualify.

The Pool is one of my favorite in town, and during the week, a top cabana is quiet enough to both read and cuddle. On the weekends, is when things really get crazy here and loud is an understatement. One of the best things about the Hard Rock is the pool. Its tropical and spread out layout always makes the top ten lists for Las Vegas. Come on a Wed. and float around in the pool or have a drink under the canopy, come on a Sunday and Rehab in the summer will be all you can hear. 
The Hard Rock is known for being a cool spot in Vegas because IT IS, people who review and say it isn't were maybe expecting a lot.

Mr. Lucky's is open all night, which is a good thing not like some of those other 24 hour cafes in hotels which I wouldn't eat at ANY hour of the day.

We got a $60-a-night special from hotels.com, which seemed like a good deal (see below for more details). The rooms are reasonably nice and the beds are relatively comfortable.

However, everything is cheaply done. Starting with the TV, which was low quality (albeit large), and you had to push the remote buttons many times to get it to do anything.

The bathroom fixtures are also cheap - the sink didn't drain when I was running it. There was a fight in the hall when I was in the bathroom, and the toilet actually shook at one point (I think that someone must have been shoved up agains the wall).

And, be forewarned that they charge a $15 per night ""resort"" fee on checkout. This is for things such as the ""shuttle service"", which runs exactly once per hour, takes you to one location, and only carries 7 people max. You can walk to the strip (we did a few times), although Vegas really isn't designed to be a walking city, so you will probably end up cabbing it to and from the strip a bunch of times. The ""resort"" fee doesn't cover wired or wireless Internet - that's an extra $14 per night (per computer).

The health club was pretty nice, though, for a hotel gym.

Also, the doors in the older tower don't close all the way unless you make sure to push them shut. There are people who go around late at night pushing doors open and stealing things. One of the people I was with had his wallet stolen.

After my friend was robbed, the hotel said that sort of thing happens all of the time, and that they don't have many security cameras (I'm guessing it was an inside job). They did move them to another room in the newer tower (much nicer), and got us into the club the next night, but this was all small consolation.

With that being said, do not take your families and children here.  There's a reason why they placed this posh hotel way off the strip.

It is also horridly dark in here.  To keep up with their rock star theme, they dim the lights awfully low.  After being in the sunlight for 5 hours coming back from Rehab, it takes awhile to adjust to complete darkness after stepping into the hotel.  Be careful of the elevators that are sectioned off.

The first thing I want to get out of the way is the roulette dealer named Flor that yelled at my wife and I and scared us away from the table all because we were slightly standing behind her; sorry there was no rope divider.  We didn't even get a chance to put down our money and hand it over to them.  I guess I should thank her for saving us cash anyway. 

The inept staff including the floor boss (who didn't even care to listen to me explain the situation) were very frustrating.  Every time I asked a question to either a security person, waitress, customer service rep no one could ever give me a clear answer.  Such as; the pool closes at 7 but you can't get in at 6.  There are two pools in this hotel and one is a club that costs even it's guest 50 bucks a pop.  None of this could be explained in a simple way.  It took my wife and I a number of times walking to wrong places and asking countless questions to gather this much needed info.  

Let me just finish with a few specifics.  The restaurants are extremely over priced even for Vegas standards.  Nobu is all hype.  If you've ever had decent sushi you will find out right way that it's terribly over rated.  A California roll as a main dish? (and bad version at that.)  We had a groupon and still found it extremely expensive.  No nigori sake either. Think the desert (non sushi) was best part. 

The casino is tiny and not very appealing.

We paid 15 dollars for small margaritas at the pool and didn't even get the salt we wanted.  But I guess that can happen anywhere.  However you'd think after you spent 50 bucks to get in, the service would be top quality, you'd think.  

To put up with all of this and not even be on the strip makes it even worse.  Now our room was nice.  It was pretty.  The rock star memorabilia is great.  Our bed was very very pleasant.  The view was pretty decent too.  And let me just give a shout out to the ""family pool"" bartender and the Rehab pool masseuse.  They were both genuine nice, good people and should be excluded from any negatives in my review.

But the reputation of the Rehab pool party and the lower prices has attracted some rude and classless guests.  Maybe that in turn has caused the staff and workers to become frustrated and not care for that was the sense I got.  The empty glass in the hall outside our neighbors door all weekend, one of our bedroom lights out, the phone not working properly, the mini bar not unlocked when we got to the room.  

The only reason to go back would be because of the unique Rehab pool party.  But actually if you're paying 50 bucks to get in as a guest might as well just stay somewhere else and pay the same. But then again I remember the Flamingo pool was astonishing and the Stratosphere pool was pretty cool too, and you know what they were free and the people that worked there seemed happy.  Maybe I could even get salt with my margarita...",7,2,2

Upon checking in, you are given a card for $25 dining credit after playing a cumulative one hour at their table games.  You just take it to the cashier's cage and they verify your play and give you the voucher good at most of their restaurants, including their steak house.  I have been to casinos where I have played for days and many hours and have been told to ""play some slots"" to get your credits up.  I don't play slots but will spend hours on end at the tables.

Here it is automatic with their hotel guests to get some dining credit very easily.  I loved their casino.  Just the right size and not too crowded.  Best dealer there by a long shot is Kelly!  She was so entertaining and personable that everyone at the time I sat down stayed for hours at her table.  I must say that the pit boss was also great and was willing to comp a few things for people, without them asking.  I just have to say that I felt like I had stepped back thirty years to  Las Vegas of old.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat, just by the way I was treated. ""The reason for the 4 stars.""

The room in the hotel was nice sized and comfortable.  The one complaint, and goes for most hotels today, is that they stock the fridge with so much stuff that you personally can't use it for anything you might happen to purchase.  In fact you don't even open it to try or it initiates billing to your room, along with the items on sensor plates on the vanity.  Let people buy what they need downstairs and bring it up to their room.  Having to be warned at checkin not to touch or they will bill you is rather silly.  Offer good room service and make the sundries people want available to buy in the shops downstairs.

If you have high-standards and want the luxurious, top-notch Vegas hotel experience then the Hard Rock is probably not for you. For our first time in Vegas we just wanted a less busy, more casual, and cheaper hotel\/casino that wasn't a complete dump and that's what we got and we had a blast.

Some negatives,
(-) The HRH suite rooms are awkward for anybody but couples. The bedroom has a glass wall where you can see right into the bathroom. YUP, someone can lay in bed and watch you shower or soak in the tub! There is a privacy curtain but it's on the OUTSIDE of the bathroom so anybody in the bedroom area can just whip it open and see you in all your naked glory! Luckily the toilet is in a small, private, closet-like room, phew!

(-) The HRH Suite  rooms themselves are dark, monochromatic, and barely rock and roll except for a couple pictures on the wall. 

(-) I think our in-room juke box was broken. It didn't even turn on. Super disappointing.

(-) Good luck trying to figure out how to get your drinks comped by your bartenders if you're gambling up at the bar. Some of them were a little rude about it too which can be frustrating when you've already been drinking and spending a bunch on slots on the casino floor. One said I had to at least put a $20 to get comped drinks, and one said I had to at least be betting $1 each time... still don't know which was the ""real way"" or if it was bartender's discretion?

(-) Even for a smoking room, our suite was dirty! Floor was dirty enough to turn your white socks black. 

(-) About 20 minutes from the strip. Doesn't sound far but it's a long, hot walk. Apparently there's a free Hard Rock Shuttle but nobody tells you about it and it's not clearly marked anywhere. Either ask about it or follow my pro-tip:

- PRO TIP - Take Uber everywhere. A couple of times we were taken ""the long way"" by cab drivers. Uber drivers can't do that because you pay before you ride. Plus a lot of Uber drivers have slightly nicer cars than cabs and you can look a lot classier hopping out of an Uber. :)

(-) Even with all the extra fees you don't get a mini-fridge or coffee maker. You can pay extra for a mini-fridge if you want, and there's a Dunkin Donuts in the casino so of course they want you to go spend your money there for coffee.

- PRO-TIP - Instead of paying for a mini-fridge go to the CVS across the street from the Hard Rock (go out of the regular casino entrance, not the HRH entrance) and buy a styrofoam cooler for around $4 and use the free hotel ice. Just be careful about the condensation that forms on the cooler.

Don't let me discourage you from staying here. We still had a great time.

Some positives,
(+) After you figure out the rules to get your drinks comped a few of the bartenders and waitresses we met were very nice and fun. Tip them well and hopefully they notice and bring you some shots like they did for us. :)

(+) In the HRH Suite, big standing shower with two shower heads, big soak tub, big windows with a great view if you are up high enough (If we were just a bit lower we would've have a fantastic view of a parking garage) and super fluffy beds.

(+) Swanky entrance and check-in\/check-out counter for the HRH Tower. Ask your driver to bring you right to the Hard Rock Hotel HRH Tower entrance.

(+) Eat at the Pink Taco restaurant! Fresh tortillas, delicious big nachos, great patio seating, yummy complimentary chips and salsa, friendly waitresses!

(+) Eat at Pizza Forte! Delicious, massive, greasy pizza slices for that hangover cure! 

(+) Eat at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast (especially when you're drunk at 4 AM, you won't be the only one there! It's surprising!)

(+) Great casual atmosphere, started feeling like home. Saw quite a few rock and roll people with piercings and tattoos (my kind of people). 

(+) Sidebet Draft Bar is so much fun for sports games. Especially for us Minnesotans because there were quite a few other Minnesotans there (escaping the cold minnesota weather) and when we were all cheering for the same team it was so much fun. 

(+) Enjoy the sandy beaches by the pools. A few of the pools are closed this time of year because the water is a little chilly but we still enjoyed sitting out in the sun and sand and soaking in the hot tubs.",5,2,2

I come to Vegas about 3\/4 times a year and after the first good experience, I chose Hard Rock as the place to be. Sad to say, this might be the last time. I experienced THE WORST BOUT OF FOOD POISONING I have ever had in my life from their in room Italian food restaurant - Slice Of Paradise. On this trip, I ordered twice from there and each time it took an hr 10 mins to an hr 23. Each time, garlic bread, spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. And the second time, also got a chicken Parm sandwich. Before that, I had had breakfast at Mr Lucky's in the morning. That place is good. 

Literally, 4\/5 hrs after eating that Italian food, I was throwing up like no other. I was in this state from 8a till 4p. I was supposed to check out at 11a but couldn't even move at this time. Explained the situation to the front desk but they didn't care and slapped me with a $55 charge for staying later. 

Overall a ""crappy"" experience and one I will not go through again at the Hard Rock.

Super comfy beds. Perfect for those 2 hour naps between raging. Amazing shower. Nice flat panel TV that I never turned on. Great mini bar selection. Lighting in the room is a bit dim. But really appreciated those black out curtains. 

The service here is pretty good. The concierge\/bell service for taxis was great. Called late one night and they even picked us up from the Wynn free of charge in the hotel SUV. Shuttle service until 5pm to the Fashion Mall, perfect for heading out to day time pool parties.

I had gone to their restaurant in Chicago, and after a mediocre (at best) experience at their restaurant on the Strip, I decided that the casino couldn't be anything I needed to experience. I was wrong.

I loved staying at the Hard Rock. All of their rooms are all nicer, and they have all been clean and hip with a little bit of rock and roll. The customer service is great as well, and they have a bunch of perks if you get their player card. My brother-in-law, who likes to gamble and who enjoyed the fun at Rehab (their day party at the pool) his first time at HR, got his room comped when he booked a stay a year after his first HR experience. Room resort + taxes were taken care of, which many resorts don't do when they comp rooms. They were smart for doing this because he did the same thing again when he came back to HR this week.

The tables are great, the dealers crack me up, some of the pit bosses lack a personality, but overall, gambling at the HR is a lot of fun. Even their machines didn't immediately rob us of our menu when they are programmed to do so. 

Their restaurants recently all updated their menus and now offer gluten free items which is a big plus for me. Also, the restaurants we have gone to offer good service and delicious food. Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's and 35 Steak and Martinis are scrumptious, and I will be going to Fu (one of their newer Asian restaurants)offers a Half Roasted Duck that is gluten free which is why I'll be going this upcoming weekend; I'm sure the review will be glowing. 

Rehab is an even better experience, but I will write a separate review for that soon.

Here's a pre-warning: If you like to sleep in in the morning, make sure to get a room that does not face the pool, because if you do you will be awoken early and not be able to fall back to sleep due to pounding music.

P.S. Their suites are incredible. If you can upgrade for a decent fee, I would do so.",2,1,1

I paid the parking fee and lost my brand new shorts and other new clothes within 20 minutes. I was bummed and when I got to the room I tried to let it go. After 2 nights the valet came to our room upon departure. I told him my story and he said that he saw a vans bag in lost and found. I met him in the lobby and he had all my stuff.

but instead THE VALET!

I arrived after a 6 hour journey from LA, and was staying during the Motley Crue week so it was very busy! After 3 times around the block and finally getting into the Valet I was told I could not valet the car at the main hotel as it was too busy, and to go to the new Valet at the towers! FINE, I went around again and was greeted very quickly by a portly, aggressive valet member.....

He wanted me out of the car before I had even pulled up! I got out and had just a few things to sort out and bring to my suitcase, he took my car keys and asked me the following.....

""what's the name on the car""

I'm not American and did not understand the question, I had hired a car to drive up from LA, so I waked around the back of the car and looked what it said and the replied it's says Lexus Hybrid.....he yelled at me back.....""who owns the car"", I didn't know he wanted my surname AT ALL! i replied, ""Hurtz"",  he was a rude, fat, aggressive like an inpatient child! ANYWAY he said really sarcastically ....well what name is on the insurance?, to which I said ""It's a hire car and the insurance is from my credit car United.

It seemed we had a break down in communication from the get go, mainly due to his lack of speech and communication skills. so I simply said....do you want my surname?

He said sarcastically  ""Finally, well done""

I had just completed a long journey and was not going to let that lie, so I replied....you know a better way of getting my name is to simply ask, what's you surname!!! and I then added ""I have never been asked the question. 'what's the name on the car"" EVER in my life""

He didn't let it go and replied ""well I have never met anyone that didn't know what that meant when I asked""

I said "" I know what it meant, and I answered you correctly..... you were just using incorrect grammar if you wanted my name......... the name on the car is 'Lexus Hybrid""

He literally then grabbed the keys and sped off in my car!!!

Upon returning to collect my car, which was brand new, there was a HUGE DINT in the bumper!!! I am pleased to know I must have riled him up so much due to his incompetence he had to take it out on my car! Luckily I have insurance for ill tempered, jobs-worth,  valet attendants. HOWEVER I filled a report, but to little avail. 

Obviously the Hard Rock valet washes their hands of the entire incident and look after their own and THEY claimed my car had been parked only once facing forward and was impossible to have been dented.....AMAZING the lies people can come up with. BECAUSE THIS FAT BARSTEWARD dinted my car!!!!!!!!

We were heading on a trip to a couple national parks and needed to spend a night in Vegas as a pitstop in between and without thinking I looked for a cheap room to stay at for a night because we would get there late at night and leave early in the morning. I mean $40 (plus their 20 something dollar fee) it was gonna be just one night anyway. 

I really really wish I just booked a room at planet Hollywood and paid the higher difference. The room smelled like cigarettes, I mean wreaked as if someone had just smoked in there right before we came in. It did not look clean. I'm not a germaphobe but I was really getting paranoid about touching anything because it seemed like nothing's been cleaned (especially in the shower). 

The only good thing about our room were the beds. Makes you feel like you're sleeping on clouds but not the type where you feel like you sink in and touch the floor. The bed hugs you to sleep. 

My mom had a difficult time falling asleep because there's like four big vents\/fans outside that are always running that make noise all night.

The room had a view of the roof and we were there for 5 days and 4 nights so we really wanted a better view. Went back down to the HRH desk and asked about a higher room and was informed of a smoking optional room on the 14th floor. (Don't take no for an answer at this place).

The center bar has two male bartenders who absolutely suck at what they do. Watched tv and flirted with the waitresses while the lone female bartender busted her arse waiting on everyone.

Check In-
Quick, private, fast, and pain free. The desk was never super busy and the young lady was more then helpful and full of personality. Was in and out in 10 mins. 

Valet & Parking - Great my car never took more then 5 mins to arrive and the hotel is directly attached to the garage so other then check in and my first day I went ahead and switched to self parking. Something I would not do at pretty much any other vegas hotel.  

*Pro Tip* The view from the top of the HRH towers parking garage is stellar it is a unobstructed full panorama of the strip and worth checking out.

The room- 
Awesome the decor, swanky ness, and features are out of this world for the price. I actually like the room more then my suite at the Encore from last trip but the Encore still has the nicest beds on the strip. 

The decor is dark especially in the bathroom and that may be off putting to some people. I found the room to be pure unadulterated awesome and have zero complaints. 

Casino-
Small and not very busy (I don't gamble much so not a big deal to me)

Restaurants-I was really surprised by the selection and quality of the food here. Oh and it's not over priced I would even go as far to say that for the convenience it's actually a bargain. Never had a bad meal and never broke the bank (I went to the strip and did that)

Cons-
The HRH towers are luxury and 5 star treatment the rest of the hotel feels the polar opposite. It's loud and crazy which is not necessarily a bad thing but it may be for some. If you don't have a car staying here could make getting to the strip a real pain. They only offer late checkout based on occupancy. 

Are you seeing me struggle to find bad things to say about this place?
That's because there aren't many.

The beds were super comfortable. The decor is very ""rock star-ish"". The color scheme was all black, white, red, and gray...very rock-n-roll! Housekeeping was very polite, helpful, and considerate. My requests were immediately taken care of as soon as it was ordered. I needed a few items from housekeeping and it took about 3 minutes after I called to bring those items up to my room. I was actually impressed!

My one star deduction is for the $6.95 charge to automatically unlock the refrigerator, and a $2.00 charge for bottled water. You pay for them to unlock the fridge and then you pay for whatever you consume out of the fridge and then you pay $2.00 to drink a mini size bottle water that is not even cold? That is just plain daylight robbery! 

Other than that, great hotel! I had a pleasant stay here. I was surprised when I came across a sweet deal on Vegas.com for HRH @ $73 per night.  Usually it goes for $150-$200 a night. I couldn't let this deal slip. I am glad I took advantage of it. HRH is made for comfort!",0,0,0

We couldn't get our tissue box replaced and they didn't take the dirty dishes from the room.  Basically, it seemed as though room service only made the bed each day.  

The gaming floor offers a decent variety of slots, tables and great music.  I appreciate the rocker clientele and the lack of kids.  In the wee hours of the morning I even got to play slots two machines down from Tommy Lee.  The drink service on the floor is a little rare but once you cozy up to the bar, the bartenders keep the convo going. 

Each night we were given free entry into Vanity, which was a decent place.  Plus, once the concierge discovered it was my birthday weekend he hooked it up!  A pile of free drink tickets and even a coupon redeemable for a bottle.

Angel and Allison need to go back to hospitality school. When the front desk tells you the resort fees would be waived off because carpet soaked, wifi not working, crying babies next door, and rooms not ready until 5pm!!!! 

Then you go to check out and resort fees still charged to the rooms. Thanks for lying to our entire group. When we question it Angel at the front desk laughs. Very professional! 

Only front desk agent that was pleasant do deal with and actually smiled and asked how may I assist you was Mallory. Mallory you should move on to a hotel where they actually care about their guests. 

Other than the front desk staff the hotel is great from amazing restaurants and very fun nightlife. Never to crowded in the casino, probably because off the strip and smaller but nice not have to fight for a spot on a table or machine.

If you touch anything on the counter they will charge it to your account. If you in the paradise tower. To go to the pool you would have to walk like half of mile. You can't bring your own drinks or snacks to the pool. It's really not a pool. Only three feet type of pool. And that's the family pool.

The pros: 
I stayed in a corner room in the Paradise tower and thought it was pretty good. Nice view (of the pool and city), nice bed, and nice furniture. 

Free lot parking next to each of the towers.

Checkout was easy peasy.

The cons:
Checking in was a pain in my arse. I first drove to the wrong tower and parked far away. After walking in, I was told to drive to the other tower and check in there. I did, and walked through the entire complex only to end up where I left off. The check in area, or ""registration"" in in the casino area which is in between the two towers (and parking lots). And then there was the hour wait to check in. I really wanted to lie down but for a few but I had to immediately leave to make it to my conference.

The rooms themselves were barely lit. I came here to work, not just party, and I really would have appreciated a reading lamp at the desk.  I also could barely see inside the bathrooms. I was glad to have a corner room because sunlight saved the day.  Also, the drains in my shower weren't so good. When I showered, an inch or two of dirty water would build up and then take 30 minutes to drain. Kinda gross.

The pool area was strange. You had to get IDd and wristbanded to get to the pool, so make sure you don't leave your wallet behind in your room. There are two main pools (and a family pool). The main pool is has sand in it (which tends to get as hot as the air) and is where music is blasted throughout the day. There are bars as well.

The free wifi sucked not because of the speed limitations but because of the router strength. I couldn't even pay to get better wifi. It was just not possible.",3,1,1

We chose this hotel because it was just a couple blocks away from the Thomas & Macke Center where the NBA Summer league is held every year. Here's the breakdown:

Parking - For the most part, parking wasn't an issue. It was free and usually we were able to find a spot close to the elevator. There was one night, though, when we came back and the structure was completely packed because there was a show AND a Kevin Hart meet and greet at the same time. It took us about 30 min to find a spot.

Room - The room was pretty standard. Double queen that was spacious and felt clean and updated. The sink in the bathroom had issues draining. But the beds\/pillows were comfortable. The AC was decent but I wish it kicked out cooler air since it was such a hot weekend. Even with the AC on full blast it was really quiet and I had to forgo the covers.

Staff - We called down for a couple items and received them within 15-20 minutes. Other than that we didn't really interact with the staff.

Overall, I really liked staying here. There was a lot more we could have explored at the hotel but didn't have time to. We didn't go to the pool or spend time in the casino for example. We did hear that they shut down their poker room though. 

If you're looking for a non-strip hotel I definitely recommend this one!",0,0,0

This time I was taking a staycation here and it was one of the worst experiences I had at the resort in the 18 years I've lived here. The staff gives out conflicting information about events, hours of venues or are just not truthful. The security staff is definitely not on the same page with each other. The menu at Mr. Lucky gets changed every 6 weeks not to keep the popular, well selling items but instead it's changed by the executive chef to massage his ego. Pathetic! The pool never has set hours. One staff member tells you it's open until 7pm then when you go in at 5:45pm, the security at the entrance not only says they close at 6:30pm, they ""ran out of towels because they are closing soon."" It turns out she lied. Another security staff member brought me a towel! Lastly, it's really stupid to make guests in the Paradise tower walk all the way around from the tower on the other side of the resort through the casino to get to the spa\/gym or pool. There are walkways between the pool areas that can be utilized and make the walk for guests so much shorter but apparently someone in upper doesn't seem to give a shit about providing this to guests even though it makes perfect sense.

1) It's upbeat.  So many hotels in Las Vegas are starting to feel like museums and\/or Westfield shopping centers.  When I walk into the Hard Rock, I'm immediately ready to have fun.  

2) It's unpretentious, but still clean and not-sketchy.  While I'm sure they do in their own way, this doesn't seem like the kind of place that's shamelessly catering to ""high rollers"" and mega-gamblers.  Most of the clientele seems to be in Vegas just to have a good time, whether that's at a show, on the strip, or at the bar (see point #1).

3) Great rooms.  Both times I've visited I've lucked out with huge corner rooms (without upgrading) and the decor is fun and different.  Beds are AMAZING too.

4) It's convenient. Yes, it's off the strip.  What you lose in strip-proximity, you gain in other amenities.  There's a CVS right across the street for stocking up with supplies (drinks, snacks, etc.), as well as a 24-hour pizza place and the always-delicious Hofbrau House.

We visit Vegas yearly to visit our son and his family, so we've skipped around town staying in various hotels.  We decided on the Hard Rock this time due to a decent price and proximity to the Strip.  It was a seven-night stay during Christmas.

I paid over $200 for a room upgrade at registration.  I was told that the Casino Tower, normally the lowest prices of the 3 towers at the Hard Rock, had undergone renovations and all of the rooms all had new features,etc.  Which it was, nice room, large mounted flatscreen TV, fantastic view of the Strip from the 9th floor.  However, we soon discovered the bathroom sink drained very poorly.  That was soon followed by the toilet not flushing at all.  Housekeeping later told us the workers doing the renovations (more on that soon) might have turned off the water.  I can't confirm that, and regardless, they never informed the room guests.  So we requested to be moved, which they did to a different room on the 4th floor of the same Casino tower.

This 2nd room was renovated as well, although the view wasn't nearly as good.  However, we soon discovered that the room renovations were still ongoing, as we were woken on two mornings to hammering in the room above us (sounded like installing tack strips for carpeting).  Again, we asked to be moved, this time to the top-tier HRH Tower.  The HRH Tower had the best mattresses and features, very nice room.

To their credit, they did remove 3 nights of resort fees, which saved me nearly $100.

Fantastic rock memorabilia and photography!  Very friendly staff. Good variety of restaurants at decent prices. Dunkin Donuts just opened last Friday,

Rooms here are nice, but everything is an upsell. I even asked for a 2nd drinking glass for the bathroom and they wanted to charge. The room only had 1 towel on arrival and after 3 calls and 2 hours, we finally grabbed towels from a cart down the hall. The staff here is rude and unfriendly, but then again after years of Vegas trips for business and pleasure, it has taken a turn that way most places near the strip.

2 times during the stay on the 10th floor the elevators were down for service (so they said) and here come the stairs, not that I don't need to walk off the calories, but twice in 1 trip to go 10 flights of stairs when I am paying $140\/nt to be in the hotel? The floor staff in the casino was rude and the table games don't have a good flow to them. 

The hotel is loud and seems like a fun environment, but truth be told, I spent 90% of my time at other casinos. The Wi-Fi signal in the room is weak and if you are using a smart device like Ipad, it kicks you off a lot.

The gym is average and make sure if you want to use the ""heated pool"", it will be open, unlike the signs that say open, but security saying it's closed.

Overall, the rooms have soft mattresses and overstuffed pillows if you like that sort of thing, this is your place. I have back issues and the mattress was horrible and I couldn't sleep well. The décor is the rooms and spaciousness is awesome, but that only goes so far when it isn't properly stocked and it's uncomfortable to stay there.

I was completely freaked out once reading all the awful reviews on here but the cancellation fees were as much as the room itself, so figured we should just go along for the wild ride. 

I was pleasantly surprised once we got into town and checked in. We were offered an upgrade for $20 to the HRH Tower w\/ Pool View and King bed. This also allowed us to check in early (arrived at 2:30) and to skip the resort fee of $25 I hear they try to charge. 

Overall the hotel is pretty nice and clean. It seems like they try hard not to have the place reek like cigs, which is a huge plus. Our room was thoroughly cleaned when we got in (and I checked the bed for human shit, after reading the horrible review below). The rooms didn't seem run-down as others have mentioned, and the bathroom was clean and stocked with lots of fluffy towels and shampoo, soap, etc. The decor is not my taste... and it's pretty hilarious that there's an Affliction store in the actual hotel (they still make that stuff?). The wallpaper, decor and general vibe of the hotel is very bro-y, sort of like you stepped back 8 years ago to a MMA convention or something, but i think that's the vibe they're going for. If you have a tribal or koi fish tattoo, enjoy the odd 'roid every now and again, and still wear platform flip flops then you will feel right at home. 

The pool was awesome! We were there on a Thursday (was happy to avoid Rehab) and there was a perfect amount of people there to keep it fun but not crazy. 

The only critiques I would have are the drinks and food are pretty expensive, but honestly that's expected here. Considering we paid $60 for the room we didn't feel too ripped off paying for $16 margeritas.

Don't let the lousy lack of a decent poker room at Hard Rock fool you.  There's money to be made at these two (that's right, usually only two) measly tables crudely roped off forming a make-shift poker ""section"" (in lieu of the old poker ""room"").

Hard Rock used to have a great poker room; big leather seats, moody lighting, and tons of cash on the table.  But for various reasons (rumors) including (but not limited to) corruption, they broke up the room and moved the tables out to the casino floor.

The poker players are now subject to the drunken riff raff coming to\/leaving Vanity (the nightclub) or Rehab (the pool party).  The floor man and dealers themselves will tell you yes, the old poker room was much nicer; but the number of drunken amateurs who plop down in the new spot make this half-assed set up actually worth it.

The poker ""room"" (I use this term loosely) is both awesome and train wreckish.  Fun!

I used booking.com to reserve 4 nights from Feb. 12-16th.  My reservation amount was $522.50 including tax and resort fees.  When I checked out, they charged me $17 more on top of my booking amount because the hotel staff said that the resort fees was increased on January 1st and third party reservations like booking.com doesn't usually get updates from the hotel.  As a customer, that is not my fault, I agreed to pay $522.50 when I booked the hotel so the hotel should honor the same.  Hard Rock hotel did not honor my booking reservations, so I have to pay more that the agreement price.  Not very good customer service.

About the room...poor lighting every where, toiletries provided was used, not enough sitting area, beds are lopsided, and TV channel selection SUCKS!

Wow! The rooms are really nice (even better when they are free) and nothing can beat the vibe at the HRH. If you are 21-30, the Hard Rock is the place. Get drunk at Body English, stumble out at 3-4AM and hit the tables with all the other drunken fools. 

Gambling is sooo much more fun when a) everyone at the table is young b) drunk and c) loud and high-fiving each other. I tend to win a lot more money those times then when I am sober. 

Body English is one of the better clubs in Vegas (Pure is still #1) - the music is always good and the crowd is damn nearly half naked all the time. 

What the HRH is famous for is the pool and the blackjack tables. I didn't get a chance to hit up Rehab this time but it definitely used to be worth it. I hear it has gone downhill lately.

Our check in took 35 minutes and when we reached the window there was no apology or acknowledgement of the long wait. There were, however, lots of reminders that outside food and beverage are not allowed as my water bottle was getting the stink eye. Really? Seems rude and disrespectful. The next morning I went to the coffee shop and paid $7 for 2 coffees. There was no real sugar at the counter. When I asked the ""barista"" for sugar, he gruffly said they didn't have any. I stood there dumbfounded. I eventually went to the diner and got my own. Later that day, I ordered a margarita with salt at the pool bar. BTW, don't expect a waitress to take your order either by the pool or while in the casino. The waitress told me that she didn't have salt for my $16 margarita.

When we went we had to take a can which cost about 30 dollars. 

Restaurant wise, they have nobu, which is awesome if you win big. Otherwise I would recommend Culinary Dropout or Mr. Lucky's. They both have decent American fare.

Tips: they won't let you bring a cooler, so be sneaky if you do and don't bring it out to the pool. There is no microwave, refrigerator or coffee makers in the rooms. They do have enough plugs if you want to bring your own, but that would be a hassle. If you want to drink by the pool, they won't let you drink your own. What we did was buy one drink and then fill it up with our own stuff back at the room.

The club, body English, is only open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. It says it opens at 1030, but they didn't let anyone in until after 11 and when it was our turn we left quickly. The music was nothing great and there were just people occupying the boths and it was very empty.

Finally we reached the front of the line and they didn't have our reservation on record, which is outrageous because I paid ahead of time with Orbitz.

I keep coming back which says it must be good enough.  It's not 5 star worthy.  Seems like people dish out 5 stars a little too generously (and conversely 1 star reviews seem overly used).  I think Hard Rock is a solid 3 to 3.5.  Here's why...

I've stayed here about 5 or 6 times over the last 5 years.  When I don't stay here I stay in Cosmo, Venetian, or Encore.  The experience is completely different.  I go to those other places for a more upscale experience.  The hard rock is great because it's a slightly higher middle class crowd with a few rednecks thrown in....I love that!  It's not quite the same crowd you'd find downtown but it's not the high end strip hotels thats for sure.

Let's not beat around the bush...the  Hard Rock is struggling.  Anyone who was there 10 years ago knows it was formally one of the hip and hopping places in town.  No so much anymore.  They have done some remodeling over the years but it's still bland and a bit dated looking.  Unless it's a concert, the 20 somethings are gone and it seems most of the clientele are 40's and 50's.  Not bad if you are looking for that.    What I do like is the dealers are generally friendly and the pit bosses are as well.  I did hear multiple complaints from them about their ""management"" being cheap which seemed to be a theme due to the number of people I heard grumble about it.

At my recent stay there was an unfortunate issue where my room had a problem.  I won't go into details here but it was creepy and crawly.  They took care of moving me immediately.  I noticed that the rooms are starting to age quite a bit with the carpet stains being the most obvious issue.  The beds are super comfy though.  I'd steal that like the soaps if I could!

Even if you don't stay there go for the food!  Nobu is simply amazing.  35 Steaks is also terrific.  I also thought their room service and the FU Asian place were great.  Pink Taco was also good.  No complaints for anything food wise.  I got my share of delicious calories! 

From a casino perspective I'm disappointed to see the 6:5 pay BlackJack show up at this off-the-strip establishment.  Especially because I know they are struggling to attract players.  Attn: BlackJack players.  DO NOT sit at at 6-5 table.  Google it if you must.  BlackJack should pay 3:2...period.   They do have a nice Lucky Lucky side bet table that pays 3:2 with a $25 minimum.  

So in summary why 3 stars?  People are friendly and helpful even if they don't like their management, food is awesome, and comps are generally good. Casino is growing a bit dated, crowd is growing older, rooms are growing dirtier.

If you are just visiting vegas and not staying here I don't recommend going unless you really like R&R memorabilia.  It's not worth the price of the cab ride to check it out.  On the other hand if you want a somewhat quieter place to stay with out a bunch of millennial crybabies...it's a hit!",0,0,1

HRH has a reputation for being pretty crazy with their Rehab party - from the looks of it, I think it certainly lived up to that reputation.  

Here's a review from someone who was sober the entire time:

Pools:  I think that they have the best pools in Vegas.  If you're like me, then Sunday morning is probably not the best time to go...but anytime during the week, when it's fairly empty, the pools are like a glimmering oasis of blue.  I think there's 10 or more.  I know that they close early, but I was able to walk in and dip my toes in ... I saw some people swimming so as long as you're discreet, maybe it's possible to do some pm swimming :)

Food:  I only ate at Pink Taco.  Their happy hour was ridiculously cheap.  We sat at the bar and ordered one of everything (giant fatties).  They seem to do chicken the best (skewers).  I also recommend the tamales.

Room:  We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  It's set further back from the hotel.  The room is very rock 'n roll - dark wall paper (very gothic) and I think the most comfortable bed...ever?  I've slept in some nice beds, but wow...after a long (make that 5 LONG days at a conference) this was a total treat.  

Bathroom:  The shower was pretty big and I like that it was separate from the sinks.  Products were great - some brand, Prickly Pear (?).  

Gym:  I really wanted to go...it looked very clean, small, but had a lot of equipment.  

I took a star off because the resort fee does suck - especially since I didn't get to use any of the amenities.",4,2,1

During my stay the hotel staff made me feel guilty for my complaints , but now reading others reviews confirms the issues within the HardRock hotel & Casino.

Checkin was quick and easy , also it was 11pm on Thursday night. We arrived to paradise, tower a funky-cool two queen bed. Our first issue occurred after having our belongs checked in with the bellhop. We called down to have our belongings brought up @ 11:10pm 3\/24\/16. By 11:40 pm our belongings were still not brought to our room. I called down to bellhop and I was told if we had our ""do not disturb sign on the door"" , I explained that we did not and that we've been waiting patiently in the room the whole time. The by the third call it was already past mid night. We asked to speak to the bellhop manger. Hector told us our luggage was sent to the wrong room. We would have to wait for them to find our luggage and then it would be sent up. In the meantime my family member needed to take her medications due to health issues. We explained this to the HARDROCK staff and no one seemed to care or understand the importance of having misplaced luggage with medications. Finally our luggage arrived at two am , three hours after our initial check in. The bellhop was very apologetic.. Didn't catch his name though.  We called down and spoke to Christian a front desk manger. He said he would give comp our room for Thursday nights stay. He also said, he would give us a call Friday morning to see if there were any other accommodations he could do. He did not do so. We spent 2.5 hours being told we would get to speak to a manger . Finally around 3pm we spoke to two Risk Mangers. They said we were already compensated for and there was nothing else they can do. We mentioned we were placed on the fourth floor right next to Rehab . Which would have been fine if we would have got to bed at a decent hour after our ordeal with our luggage. We were told we could move to the 16th floor and the opposite side of the pool party. The female risk manager, asked if we were ready to move right now , we said yes but still waited 2 hours to get moved to our new room. When called to front desk to find out what was going on during that two hour period , we were treated poorly yet again. Finally the bellhop arrived and he was quite friendly and apologetic. 


Our second issue occurred at a in house dining restaurant at Mr. Lucy's 3\/26\/16. I ordered the $9.99 steak & egg special. The food quality was poor , the steak was like beef jerky and the toast was like cardboard. When I reported my issue with the quality of food , the waitress  proceeded to say well it is a $9.99 steak. The waitress said I could change my order. I ended up ordering bacon , another stale piece of toast, and over easy eggs that were very runny. Overall the food quality was very poor , so the waitress told me they would refund my comp card with $50 dollars . That did not happen. 

Third issue was with our room . The lights went out in the bathroom . The shower was very nice and had great water pressure , but the shower drain was clogged. We called and maintenance came right away to fix the issue. We then had to call and have house keeping disinfect the shower after a plunger was used. It took house keeping an hour and half to come up. Once there the house keeper went above to make sure the bathroom and room was cleaned up. 

Our friends also had issues with their stay.  They didn't have blankets on the bed , yes  I said blankets. They had to call housing keeping and were given fuzzy brown jail house style blankets. They also , didn't have a iron in the room. They called house keeping several times the day of their brothers wedding to retrieve a iron. 

Last but not least .. We wanted to use that $50.00 comp we were told that would be reimbursed from Mr. Lucky's. We went to Pink Taco on our last day at the HARDROCK 3\/28\/16. We were told by the waitress that their was only $3.00 left on our comp card. Embarrassed we got up and left. We tried to resolve this issue with the cashiers office. We were so fed up we just decided to leave take our business somewhere else. 

Overall I really wanted to like this place . The customer service skills are just not there. Like other reviewers have said..they really need to hire a hotel management company to come in a re-work their system. I wouldn't stay here again and definitely wouldn't recommend it to friends\/family .",7,5,2

Loud music, young crowd etc. but I was so disappointed in our last stay. When I booked with them we asked for a pool view. Upon checking in the gave us a ""mountain side"" view. No mountains just the back of an ugly building and roof. We asked to be moved so they upgraded us to a pool side room. They did not inform us however this would be an additional $25 a night. I thought I had already booked a room with a pool view?!? We get to our new room and the view of the stage is amazing we are so excited, only to get changed to go party and notice puke all over the room (lamp shade, floor, even ceiling). They made us wait there for a housekeeping manager to come inspect it. She apologized, but didn't really care. They moved us for the 3rd time in an hour to the last room at the hall with no pool view again. It was so frustrating!! The manager told us she would give us a $50 food and drink comp and wave our resort fees. We said great, thank you!! Upon checkout there was no manager to be found and we had to fight with the checkout host to get about 10 random charges taken off of our bill. We were charged for Jack Daniels that apparently was set off by the motion detector, upgrading to different rooms, the resort fees and food and beverage that they said they would comp. We tried to explain to him what had happened, but he said because there was no manager he could only wave one resort fee. I find it hard to believe that there is not one manager in the building to speak with. We ended up paying a huge bill and I had to deal with the whole mess when we got back. The hotel is very fun, but the Hard Rock's level of customer service was disappointing.

Back to the Hard Rock, it's not that convenient to get around if you don't bring a car, but the valet is great if you do.  They always had our car ready before we got downstairs. Our room was nice, black, dark, but the bed was comfy.  I suppose the Hotel Staff was on a skeleton crew because we had to wait for everything.  All being said, I am glad we stayed there, love the music 24\/7 but there are so many places to stay in Vegas, I think we'll stay somewhere else next time.",0,0,0

The customer service here is great. Everyone is friendly. We got a room near the pool area and the music was loud, which we didn't mind at all. I was a little sad we were unable to get an early check in and that we weren't allowed to go on the pools on certain days because we had to pay. I guess I assumed it was part of the hotel stay? The room was great, very clean, nicely decorated. Downfall was that it was NOT on the strip, not even close. I probably should have looked up the location before buying. All in all, it wasn't a bad deal and this was a great hotel. They give good prices and the customer service rocks. Everyone in the hotel seemed friendly and there was good vibes all around. So if you don't mind staying off the strip to save a couple bucks definitely check out the Hard Rock.",1,1,1

So, I called the hotel at noon on my day of check in to let them know that I would be there at midnight. Our drive from Newport to Vegas was quick and painless, got some In and Out and was ready for a fun fun night in Vegas. We pull up at the hotel at midnight and guess what... go to check in. ""Oh we're sorry, the hotel is sold out. We'll give you this non-HRH room plus $200 food and beverage and waive your resort charges"". Fine, FAIL! Go to the room and what a scary sight. Like something Hunter S Thompson stayed in. Dirty room, next to an elevator, next to a ice maker. Too bad the good Dr Gonzo didn't leave his magic suit case for us! The Either or some pills would have helped us sleep considering ""Ding"" elevator ""rubble, rubble"" ice machine every 20 minutes! FAIL#2 Complained some more and got nowhere. Sucked it up and made the best of it considering they said they'd move us first thing tomorrow morning. 
 
Ahhhh, if it was that easy. Tomorrow morning rolls around and no dice! Couldn't get a hold of the front desk to save my life! FAIL#3 Phone rang and rang, finally called for the manager. She apologized up and down, said give her ""an hour"". We went down to the ReHab pool, sacked up and spent $200 on 2 chairs. I confirmed with the pool attendant that the seats were ours for the day. ""Yes"" and he gave me a receipt. Go back to the room and 2 hours after my initial call my new room is ready. FAIL#4 ""OK can you please send the bellman to move our bags?"" ""No they are too busy"". WTF! Really?? FAIL#5 We finally get into our new room...WOW, HRH Suites are super duper nice. Thanks for putting salt in the wound given the disgusting room we stayed in the night before. 
 
What ever! Go back down to the pool, the security guard decides to be Mr Big Man with a small di#@. Tells my girlfriend she cant bring her purse into the pool. Really, I was able to 2 hours ago? Whatever, FAIL#6! So she goes back to our room and I go to our chairs by the pool. GUESS WHAT!?! They moved our stuff; ""we weren't there...""FAIL#7! Moved us to the back pool and the pool attendant must have compared his junk to the security guard and was all butt hurt because this guy didn't care where I was or what happened. ""This is the best you're going to do"". Glad I came down early and got a good seat...nope. Pool gets 3 highlights; Amber our waitress, super nice. Ian, who said he'd help us out and make up for it and then Courtney, who actually took care of everything, thank you. 
 
Things are looking up for us from this point on, in fact had a very nice dinner at 35 Steaks. Really enjoyed the Beet Salad and my Ribeye. Following dinner we went to the bar anticipating the real reason we're here. Fitz and the Tantrums. Oh, FAIL#8 is right here...I spent $90 on 2 tickets, I'm dumb, cause there's a voicemail on our room phone and some girl walking around the casino handing out free tickets! Darn it! Wasted that money. Show was AWESOME, love those guys. Really, if you get a chance, go see Fitz...just do it somewhere other than the Hard Rock Hotel. 
 
After the show, headed into Vanity Night Club, with thanks to Courtney's business card, we would have never gotten in without it. You should have seen the ""line"" actually it wasn't anywhere close to a line just a mess of tarded looking people trying to get into the club. (Tangent here: Hey Big Girls, I know someone loves you, but don't wear that dress! Wow!) Zero organization by hotel security. Almost a fail, but we got in with some elbow grease by my partner in crime. Had a great time at the club! Big space, fun music, I like the out door area to get away for a bit. Finally the night is almost over, we went back to the room to order room service...wait for it...it's almost here...yup, FAIL#9: Delivered our room service and you'll never guess...brought the wrong food! Love it, not the failures the irony of it all! We eat what was there, booze makes you do crazy things. Went to bed and thought we were done.
 
FAIL#10!!!! Went to check out and the bill was wrong! They didn't waive the resort fees. Really, had to wait on hold for Manager (got to know the management staff well on this trip). They fixed the bill and I was done! 
 
Back to our management encounters, all of them. Matthew, Courtney, Ian and 2 other front desk managers. All super nice all said ""Sorry"" way too much and all need to stand up at their next management meeting and fix the system, the hotel and the way things work and most of all the bell desk and pool attendants attitudes towards hotel guests!...You guys are in a service industry, pretend to be nice and friendly, you don't know who you're going to be rude to, he may be some guy who has too much time and likes to yelp.",6,2,1

Got stranded in limbo at front desk because bell guy refused to check our case of water, due to it being:  ""food"".  Checked in to our pee-stained ""executive room"" and checked out our spacious view of cigarette butts on the roof.  I wanted to get a closer look and take in the encompassing rooftop view, but alas, the French doors would not open to the veranda.  Weird, because the descriptions of the rooms on the website say the doors open.  Then again, they say the King rooms provide something to the extent of breathtaking views or something like that.  OK.  In all fairness, if the doors WOULD open and I COULD take in the air, my breath may have literally been ""taken"" by the smell of the cigarette butts on the ground entering my room.  Who knows...

Advice:  Learn how to run a hotel, Hard Rock.  It would be wise to hire an outside company to teach you the ways.

If you book far enough in advance, it's about $100 per night for a low end room on the weekend and half that on weekdays.  You can get Kettle One vodka cocktails for $6 at the center bar.  The cocktail waitresses will even bring you complimentary grey goose if you're gambling. 

Most of the restaurants here are pretty good and they have a Mr. Lucky's 24\/7 where you can eat breakfast, lunch or dinner items anytime.

The decor is one of the things I love best here.  You will find authentic music memorabilia from hundreds of legends.  For example: Johnny Cash, Queen, Guns and Roses, Nirvana, The Beatles, Tupac, Ice T, Lil Jon, Bob Marley, etc.  You almost feel like you're in a museum here because many of the music exhibits are so robust with memorabilia.

There are also beautiful people everywhere here and little to no children.  This is my favorite aspect.  Hard Rock invented the ""pool party"" with Rehab, and you will regularly find an abundance of these beautiful people packed into Rehab during the warmer months.

Finally, the biggest downside of Hard Rock is the location about a mile off the strip.  So keep in mind you will have to cab everywhere or walk for a half hour just to get to the closest of the big hotel casinos on the strip.  If this place were on the strip, it would get 5 stars from me.",1,0,0

Best Dish: 7\/7\/7 Steak & Shrimp

With all the gambling, partying, and shopping that happens in Vegas, it's only natural to try to find the best deals. This to me is a hidden gem. Inside the Hard Rock (which is off the strip), there is a restaurant called Lucky's where you can get a plate of Steak and Shrimp for $7.77, salad and mashed potatoes are also included. That's pretty much the best deal in town, especially if you consider a big mac on the strip is about 5 dollars.",3,3,4

I decided to stay off the strip because of the room. When I get to the hotel, they tell me, ""we over booked and don't have a room available for you in the HRH tower."" They then offered me a ""celebrity suite"" in the casino tower. Sounded great to me. 

I unlock my door, holding all my bags, and the room is pitch black. Im feeling around the dusty walls for a light switch, couldn't locate one. I turn my phone flashlight on, not a single recessed light in the place. Only dim laps that you need to walk around to individually and turn on. The place looked like a gross 90's porn set. The hotel was built in 1995 and I can guarantee you this room hasn't been touched since.  

I go down and speak to the receptionist, the supervisor, and call the 3rd party company I booked through. All of them said the same thing to me, ""but sir we upgraded you to the celebrity suite"", ""Sir we can waive the $25 resort fee"". This was no upgrade, and the more they kept calling it that, the more disappointed I got.

I finally give up and realize they aren't going to comp me my room, so I ask if they could at least help me out on a price for an additional night in the original HRH tower I booked. At this point I'm thinking I will give them one more shot to make
It right. Supervisor says ""no problem sir, here is the price we can do for you"". I go on my phone and find the same room cheaper online.

- The beds are very comfortable.  The pillow top mattress is soooo soft we melted into the bed.  We didn't want to wake up in the morning....LOL

- There is a $15 per day resort fee.  For that you get access to the spa among other amenities.

- The bathroom is huge!  Large, deep tubs.......large shower with rainfall shower head.

- The mini-bar is motion activated.....which means if you take something from it, if it's gone for more than 2 minutes it will automatically be charged to your room.....be careful not to remove anything unless you really want it!

- The toiletries were awesome.  Soaps & shampoo were good quality.

- The lobby of the new HRH Tower has a ton of new memorabilia in it....worth checking it out.

Some QUICK TIPS:
- Parking for the HRH Tower is on the south side of the building.  Park at the parking garage or valet which is off of Harmon.  If you go to the other parking area, it's far from the new tower.

- You get $10 in FREE Slot Play when you check into the hotel.....use it, it's FREE money.  The Better Half redeemed it but didn't win anything.

Overall, we had a great time at the Hard Rock.  A nice little staycation in our favorite city!

Now, it's a full on hotel and casino with entertainment venues and several restaurants. Rooms are usually affordable, and it's not too far from The Strip. However, I'd think twice about bookin' here. 

An event brought me to the Hard Rock, so I booked a room for the night at a bargain rate. My room was located in the Casino Tower facing the pool. Instead of the deluxe king room that I originally reserved, I was given a double queen because it was one of the only non-smoking options at the time. 

The Casino Tower has got to be one of the oldest parts of the entire property, and I wouldn't recommend staying there. Although rooms in the tower have received contemporary updates, mine felt dated with its lackluster hardware, dirty vents and walls, and a high bathtub with a slippery floor. The beds were comfortable, except I noticed one of the comforters was dirty. 

Walls are THIN. I heard a whiny lady next door complaining to her dude, toilets flushing, and loud music playing downstairs -- just classy. But really, none of that irritated me as much as the loud noise in the pool area and the construction work I heard late at night through 7:00a.m. Originally, I thought there were some drunks trying to open the doors to the faux balconies that the rooms have, but on and off I heard a loud humming noise from outside, jack hammers, sawing, and hammering from downstairs -- thanks for the heads up, front desk.

However, I was extremely disappointed with my visit this week. I made a reservation and pre-paid on the phone. The reservation agent never asked me about a nonsmoking room.

That being said, I really love their pools and I've always had a good time there.  Some people may complain about the resort fee, but if you use the pool the way it's supposed to be used then it's worth it as it is well taken care of and the other patrons of the pool are friendly.  It also doesn't hurt to have good dj's playing and good drinks.  Anyway, I'd totally stay here again and if you don't like the size of the casino or the restaurants then go somewhere else...that's what Vegas is all about after all.",0,0,1

Our room opened up to Rehab 7 stories up so we could hear the music pumping from the room and it made for a big time party suite. To be honest, the casino is definitely not something special and the restaurants there are not great, except for the outdoor\/indoor one by the other pool that has a glass bottom pool as a roof. Really sweet. 

The hotel pretty bare bones but the pool is like no other place in this world and a $300 room comes with two $150 wrist bands so it makes a lot of cents. Pretty far from the strip though. The beds were to die for too. So soft and comfy. Like a cloud!",1,0,0

This post serves as a formal complaint on the completely HORRIBLE experience we had this past weekend Oct. 22-24th, at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas that ruined my bachelorette\/girls trip. From the moment we stepped on to the property, we encountered RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL employees. Very rude female front staff at the HRH Registration desk who was too irritated to provide directions to the main hotel registration after informing us in a ""matter-of-factly"" nature our original HRH Tower suite reservation was redirected to the main hotel.   Plus the decietful male desk staff (including the male manager) at the main Hard Rock Hotel Registration\/Check-in who repeatly told us that our reservation information was wrong and implying that not only we were lying about our reservation but that we were trying to get free upgrades. If you book through an online site (like Travelocity) the staff will disregard your orginal reservation and treat you like a lower guest as if that is a punishment for not booking directly. Your reservation will be as invalid as if you just walked in without any reservation at all. We were not the only party having issues with third party booking sites. We called Travelocity and they were just as confused as to the manner the hotel was dealing with the reservation.

 Amongst the long list too numerous to name here, the low-point of our weekend was after dealing with our reservations with the front desk for over an hour, they provided us keys to a room which was ALREADY OCCUPIED filled with guests' valuables such as a guitar, laptop, luggage AND a sleeping guest in the bed! Rather than apologizing for the situation, they blamed the guest for not checking out as indicated on the computer and took no blame. I couldn't believe how lightly they responded to that situation, not even concerned for the guest we walked in on. Since it had been well over 2 hours dealing with our room situation, we settled on a room that we didn't want.

To top it off, eating lunch Saturday afternoon at Mr. Lucky's we encountered a female server who repeatedly rolled her eyes when we asked questions on menu items and curtly served us our drinks. We were so frustrated and completely in shock with the continued bad encounters with staff, we decided to purposely leave the hotel for all food and entertainment purposes because it was so bad. Rather than finding relief in your hotel, we literally cringed everytime we had to walk through the casino back and forth from the room to taxi. 

We had a VERY unpleasant experience. It seemed that the majority of staff we encountered had a very bad attitude and forgot they were in a hospitality business. I highly discourage anyone to stay, let alone waste time & money at this property and instead spend your money at a resort with polite staff that actually smile and appreciate guests.

The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino has been on my wish list of hotels to stay at for a long time now. I'm always played and dined here, but never had the chance to stay here. Well, wish fulfilled 11\/2010! Although it wasn't as grand spectacular as I had imagined\/hoped, it was a great two days with my lovely Jackie!!! 

We had a nice Paradise Tower room over looking the famous Rehab pool, which was unfortunately closed for the winter season. The room was clean, stylish, and functional. 

It did lack some things: hand moisturizer (hello, we're in the desert!), broken make up mirror lamp, rain shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, and a lack of towels. 

The casino is far...really FAR from the Paradise tower. Not even joking! It was best for us to use the self park garage rather the valet because it was right next to our room tower and elevators. And since I'm on the Valet guys, it's best if you want to earn tips ($$$) if you aren't in a cluster fuck chit chatting while paying hotel guests need a little direction where to pull up for valet and check into your employer's hotel!!! 

Casino: it was sadly empty. Only 2 craps table and 2 roulette tables open. It must have been a slow night. I'm glad I walked out ahead $500+ Thank you!!!

I love that the lighting is dim (you'll always look good in low lights) and that the colors of the casino are all dark purples, oranges, and reds. It is a sassy atmosphere with a hint of bad-ass. The dealers are all very nice and are very helpful if you have questions. The cocktail waitresses are all very beautiful and very accommodating. They don't always come around when you want them, but wait a little bit and you'll find a cute little number asking if anyone wants drinks. Be quick though! You have to order pretty fast because they go to all the tables and try to get everyone's order. I was skipped over a few times because I didn't speak up. 

The clothing shops there borderline the L.A. look and what Criss Angel wears. I was uncomfortable when I went into those shops because the staff took a look at me and kind of turned their noses up. It was fine with me because the clothes are definitely not my look. If you like heavily designed and decorated clothes and you wear your hair quite spiky and hair-sprayed, then I'm sure you'll be in heaven.
You can get a tattoo as well! There is a tattoo parlor that take appointments as well as walk-ins. They are always busy, so I'd definitely call before you go.

The hotel rooms are spectacular. They have three towers and all three of them are amazing. The rooms have super comfy beds and flat-screen televisions with iPod compatible radios. The showers are huge and very nice.

The pools are all outside and I don't recommend going in them until the busy seasons. The off seasons they heat one pool to about 80 degrees, but honestly, it feels more like 50 degrees.

It is a little bit off the strip, but it is only about a $10 cab ride to the strip. Walking isn't bad either, just make sure you have a buddy to walk with.

There are a lot of very good, and very bad reviews for this hotel. I kind of read them like ""idiot"", ""brilliant"", ""idiot"", ""brilliant"", and so on...

That should tell you something.

I almost feel like writing, ""trust me, stay away"" and not go into all the miserable details of a completely lousy Vegas experience at Epic levels.

- no soap or shampoo available. Nope. you must pay 24 dollars for that cleansing privilege.

- check out is at 11. If you are late, or you want to stay in for an extra 30 min, or 5 min, or 1 min, they charge you 100 bucks an hour if you can believe it. Wow. Even the prostitutes that hang out at the bar have better rates than that.

- they charge around 15 bucks to your bill for...well...nothing...hotel service fee. The lady at reception said it was how the hotel brings in more revenue. Uh huh. I get that. But how in the hell does a hotel charge me for nothing? I mean, 15 or 150, the principle is the same. Complete scam job.

- tiny, teeny, weeny, little towels. Enough to cover my leg. One of them. Again, no bloody soap!!! not even a bar. Sick. Even motel 6 gives you soap. And now I'm naked with no towel and dirty as sin!

- food all around mediocre. Nobu is the biggest joke on earth. Oh, I'll save that review for another time along with the silliest fake-Italian restaurant. Mama mia, e bene - says the large fake-Italian man who should compete with Adam Sandler for who can do a worse accent.

- Service: well, think what would happen if the same people who were part time prostitutes\/drug dealers\/musicians\/Ed Hardy fans, etc. all got jobs in the service industry running a hotel and now you know who you will be dealing with at the Hard Rock

- Clientele looks like they all just broke out of Arkham Asylum and\/or an Ed Hardy fan museum.

Seriously, this is a fun place to hang out at for 20 minutes and then your head starts to pound from the drugs someone dropped in your drink and you wake up pregnant in a 3rd world country as a love slave. At least that's what happened to me. Please, Mom, if you're reading this...save me. The guy who has me wears a trucker hat with swarzky crystals...

Also if you think about walking it to the strip, good luck to you. You'll have to walk by a busy high way street with bums hanging out on the side street.  It was just really hard to get around and have fun because everything was too far.

So I went back down to the front desk, she asked if i want to switch room or had TV and phone fix in next 5 to 15 min.  I was tire and lazy to move, so i agreed to had them fix.

Among my group of friends, this is the place to host a Bachelor party. They totally leave you alone as far as noise and the aroma of herbal joy emitted from the room. 

There's a liquor store across the street, so buy beer there and take it to your room. Bring it in early, past 6pm they'll not let you bring it to your room.

I haven't partied in any other room other than the Celebrity Suite so I can't vouch for those, but the Suite we party in costs $1,200 for 2 days, you can talk them into letting you stay just for Saturday night at $800 but it takes some work.

Nobu is downstairs too, that place was pretty tasty. I had hamachi sashimi w\/ jalapenos and a miso\/soy sauce and a kobe beef dinner. I'm not sure how much it was cause my wife paid for the bill from our home in Cali. That was one of the best birthdays ever.

The downside: everything is so expensive. over-priced! Although, it could just be vegas. But seriously, $35 for sunscreen? and $9 for skittles? skittles! come on! and $17 for a club sandwich and $45 for a veggie and hummus platter? There was no one at the pool and they wanted to charge us $500 for a cabana that no one was using.

But this is vegas, you don't come to stay in the room, you come to gamble, drink, party, shop and more.. This is why i can only give the hard rock a 3 star rating.. I love the hotel, its chic, clean and the rooms are sick, but there is just nothing around it.  You really need a taxi or a car to get to anywhere that isn't the hard rock.

The casino is decent, however I don't recall seeing a poker room and that is a major draw back for me since i am a POKER fanatic!

The restaurants are decent, the night life seemed a little dead when we passed by, however i cannot speak for pool season as i hear it is amazing..

All that's happening is here if you want it bad enough. Gambling, booze, women & rock n roll is what the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel is all about in you in Las Vegas. A vice for everyone to pillage, plunder and indulge to extreme excess. 

Now should you spend all your time in your room, THE HRC has some of the best rooms on or off the strip. Everything from dual TV's to I-pod connectors built into the wall. Some room's have life size images of your favorite rock n roll band along with huge bathrooms for the time when you & the porcline god decide to give up the drinks your consumed hours before or simply bath your sin away. You simply don't wanna leave your room, but then again your journey doesn't start until you actually leave your room. 

The path to destruction starts with your first drink and roll of the dice. You may think that gambling is all the HRC has to offer and your wrong. Some of the best concerts I've ever witnessed have come to THE JOINT. Artists are starting to do residency's at the venue. Guns & Roses, Def Leopard and coming soon KISS.

Friendly and helpful staff, smells great, away from the chaos of the strip, wonderful pools. I could go on forever.

I'm a regular to the hard rock hotel Las Vegas, by regular I mean I come here at least every year and I even stayed 1 month in the HRH suite.

But this year it's the first time I'm disappointed.
We (my gf and I) booked 6 days via bookingdotcom as my Backstage Pass didn't work on the HRH website and since we weren't sure about the dates (17th august) of arrival we had the possibility to cancel the reservation.
When we arrived on Monday we weren't sure about the room we reserved (King Casino Tower) and wanted to get a better room, so we decided to upgrade to a HRH suite (also the rate was the same on the website.)

But it looks like if you ask to upgrade at the front desk they are going to give you the crappiest room available like walking a mile to get there, stains everywhere, used furnitures, the shower hose was broken and no offers to get to parties and restaurants even if you're staying a week. 

We also stayed 2 hours playing in the casino @2am, and the waitress was just snob, she passed (looking the other way) by us 5 times without asking if we wanted to drink something ...

The best part of the "" best Pool of the year 2015 ""  was closed during week days to get cleaned up for the (dirty) Rehab, which didn't leave a lot of place to stay around the others swimming pools.

Maybe it was a bad week, but the service wasn't as high as a couple of years ago at the same period.

Be careful and don't expect too much if you plan to go there, might be good for young people on budget and first timer in Vegas.

Even if I love this casino resort I might plan to try another one next time on the strip with better nightclubs and services.",7,1,1

Two stars instead of one for the poolside cabanas. The cabanas are great, but reserving one is a chore. Every step of the way, the process is riddled with staff giving you attitude and telling you to call later or that it's too late to get one (""getting a cabana is like winning the lottery"" -- actual lame quote from Jim, the beach club manager) or come down in person or ask someone else or ""they're filling up fast, better get one quick!"".

We checked into an HRH suite on Monday around 3PM. When requesting a non smoking room the lady at the front desk said we could have a better view if we checked into a smoking room. Being non smokers we opted for the non smoking room so our suite did not have much of a view. We were very excited to stay at this hotel since it was our first time and we have pretty much stayed at every hotel on the strip. For starters, there were many things not working in our room, the shower being one of them. For clarity, the hand held shower head did spray water out of it, but it was broken on the part of it that connects it to the shower head causing water to spray out the side of it, we were unable to move it and had to shower standing in the corner of the shower. The overhead shower head did not work at all. The jukebox everyone talks about did not work at all. The cable tv had minimal channels that worked, the others had poor reception and did not come in. The sheets on the bed were ripped up and had holes in the side, the room was ""clean"" but had marks on the lampshades and the walls, and a weird greasy handprint on the glass in front of the tv in the bedroom area.  
The bed was comfortable and had no bedbugs which was a plus. The bathtub was also huge and I appreciated being able to take a bath in the morning when we discovered the shower not working. 
My husband was in Las Vegas for work and while we were here we had to have a package sent to the hotel which we picked up at the business center. When we arrived to pick up the package the rude lady at the front told us ""we charge for packages and you owe us $65"" when my husband questioned ""$65?"" She did not explain why we were being charged this amount. While looking on the actual hard rock casino business center website, we were overcharged for picking up the package. The package was in a small 12X12 box, weighing 18 pounds and had been held by the casino for less than 3 hours. The price quoted online would be $45, so that was a little odd and we were not thrilled but needed this package so my husband could finish his job out in Vegas. 

This casino is far from the strip, 1.6 miles to be exact, so for us it was walking distance but if you're not used to it, may be a little far. 
The hotel is filled with rock star memorabilia, some of it is really neat, and some of it is really gross, like Jerry Garcias hair! Who wants to see that?! 
All in all we were unhappy about a few things in our room and the service at the business center and probably would not pick this hotel again in the future. For the money we spent it is definitely worth it to look into other hotels on the strip that are more accommodating and have friendlier staff.",2,0,0

OK, first day we were booked into a handicapped room, no big deal, BUT i feel that they hotel should have upgraded us since we booked our room a month in advance and they should have kept a room for us. whatever. the girl at the front desk was a little snobby, but bad customer service is something I'm used to. 

second day was fine. 

third day, my husband woke up to find that all the money (about $1500 cash) was missing from his wallet along with my driver's license. he immediately went down to the security desk and reported that someone had been in our room while we were sleeping and stolen the contents of his wallet. security was very blase and really didn't care about our plight and stated there was really nothing they could do. wow. we certainly weren't expecting a hand out, but it would have been nice if they had at least pretended to care. 

the rest of the day was tried to make the best of it, went out with what little money i had in my bank account and pretty much just walked the strip and ate cheap appetizers, because that's all we could afford. 

that same night we returned around 1am and i noticed my jewelry box had been overturned on the bed. we looked around the room and saw all of our suitcases had been ransacked. they had stolen about $2000 worth of jewelry, my husband's new clothes and even his new pack of BOXERS! we immediately went to security and they came up to our room.we asked if we should call the police and the security individual told us the police were already involved and would be contacting us regarding our statements that we had given him. the whole time he was in our room he was just as blase as the first gentleman, joked about it, and said it was our fault for not utilizing the safe. we then realized that when the first incident happened, they had stolen the cash, license, and our ROOM KEY. so they had the balls to return the next night and really clean us out. 

i feel that if the first security person had cared or helped us AT ALL they could have re-keyed our room and the second incident wouldn't have happened, but again THEY DID NOT CARE. 

the next day, we went to a manager for a follow up, but were given the run around and more attitude as if we were bothering them by getting burglarized. while we were speaking to the manager, we saw a cockroach on the floor that was at least 6"" long, which the manager discreetly disposed of. he then gave us a different room after we told him that we had to barricade the door with chairs and slept with one eye open fearing we could literally be attacked at any moment. he acted like he was really doing us a favor by offering safety in his hotel. 

we finally left this god awful place Monday and called that afternoon for an update. we were told that since we didn't file a police report, there was nothing they could do....if you remember, the security guard told us the police were already involved and would be contacting us regarding our statements, A TOTAL COMPLETE LIE! why would he lie to us?? 

all this was reported to hotel complaints to no avail. 

we took up the issue with risk management we were told that 'an employee was not involved in the break in'...um OK? we never suggested that but now i think we'd be right to be suspicious. when i kept asking the risk management guy why no one cared and why NOTHING was being done and why an apology wasn't offered HE HUNG UP ON ME!! great customer service. wow. 

THEN i check my bank acct a day later to find that 3 more nights had been charged on my acct!! when i called to complain and have it removed, they again, offered no apology and had yet another attitude. 

i have never been treated so poorly in las vegas or ever. the whole weekend was absolutely unbelievable, just an absolute nightmare that is still ongoing because the HRH refuses to take responsibility for the gross lack of proper security, cust service, and follow through. what are all those cameras there for if we have to sleep with chairs up against the door??

We usually stay at The Bellagio or Mandalay Bay ( MB) as my significant other ( SO) is a Platinum MLife member for years.  The hotels  are both very different, but we enjoy them both.

In September 2016 my SO stayed at MB and was very disappointed that his host. Nick Gordon had left for The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino just prior to his stay.  He was not pleased with his replacement MLife host and really liked Nick so, this last trip 7-10 Oct 2016 he booked with Nick Gordon at The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  I was a little hesitant as we had never stayed there before and I knew it catered to a younger crowd.

We were there for The RISE Lantern Festival NE of Las Vegas and had a blast.  I highly recommend it.  We got to the hotel about 11 pm Friday.  It was hopping and as I expected it was a younger crowd and the music was quite loud.  I wasn't feeling well and the line to check in was long, but Nick showed up almost immediately and whisked us away to the VIP check- in area.  What a difference!!! Luxurious check in area which was quiet and has a separate entrance for valet parking.  It took us no time to check in and I really enjoyed checking out all the music and costume memorabilia well displayed throughout the hotel.  It is something the hotel is particularly known for besides the great live concerts and RxRehab Pool\/Party venue.  Nick offered me Spa services, but I passed this time.  I will definitely check it out and review it for you then.

We had a Standard Suite on the 14th floor ( perfect for two) with a view of the Wheel,  Strip and pool area below.  The suite was nicely appointed with a huge, comfortable L shaped couch.  The living area was separated by two separate sliding doors to the bedroom which had 2 extraordinarily fluffy and comfortable queen size beds.  A glass partition with a pull back curtain separates the bedroom from the nicely appointed bathroom.  The tub was huge and big enough for two large people as was the shower.  The shower head had a rain style shower head and a separate shower head with pull out handle nozzle with great water pressure.  There was also a built in large seat.
The convenience store next to the VIP area has milk bath salts in a large glass container.  I highly recommend them.

 I was sick and ordered room service at least 4 times while we were there.  Everything I tried was excellent even the chicken noodle soup was fantastic and I was very grateful they carried it on the menu.   
Don't miss the chocolate covered strawberries on the dessert menu.  They were so fresh and decadent!  The room service menu was very large and available 24\/7.  Larger than either the Bellagio or the Mandalay Bay as well as fresher and MUCH faster delivery!  The service staff were all friendly, responsive and professional.

Nick had sent up a special guitar box and huge cheese and fruit platter ( see pictures).  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  The cheeses were very high quality and there were more beautiful chocolate covered strawberries!  We snacked all weekend!

Nick checked us in for Fri-Monday am which gave us a lot of leeway as to our departure time so we didn't feel rushed in the least and left late Sunday well after traffic.
Nick made our stay so special.  We felt like we were his only clients!  The VIP suites were exceptionally quiet.  There was some louder music coming from the pool area during the day.  If you plan to sleep in then I'd bring some ear plugs for comfort.

I napped several times on the large suite L shaped couch and wow was it comfortable.
The weekend was so relaxing for me.  My SO gambled to his hearts content and made enough points to earn a Gold card.
Nick checked on him often to see if he needed anything.  He was so professional and  efficient without hovering and always available.

On Sunday I noticed that the Casino seemed a lot quieter after many of the weekend crowd had departed.  I was thrilled to find out that Nobu, one of my favorite resturant's was on site and Nick made our reservations.  The food was fantastic.  I think better than Nobu at Caesar's and felt more intimate.  Nick came in and said Hi and asked if everything was to our liking. 

We both travel a lot for business and pleasure both domestic and internationally.
I put our stay and Nick's service at the top of my hotel experiences.  I'm so glad we decided to stay with Nick and give The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino a try!   We will be back soon!",2,0,1

When I explained to the manager, Nataya, that it's abnormal for a hotel to add these extra fees, and that no one had explained them to me at arrival, she flatly stated that I should take up the issue with my credit card. Apparently these charges are explained in the fine print when you sign in so I was stuck with them. WOW! I have never been treated so shabbily by any hotel, far less a top-tier Starwood property. What a crappy way to end my first and LAST stay at the Hard Rock. All I can say is that I hope the $40 in charges were worth a pissed off customer who will never return and will convince as many of his friends on Facebook, Twitter and Yelp to avoid this place like the plague.",3,0,1

I booked my stay at the Hard Rock Hotel through Expedia and got a killer deal. For the price, this is probably the most modern and well-maintained room you can get in the area. 

I've seen older reviews and people complaining and posting pictures of rooms with outdated and ghetto looking bathrooms and such, but perhaps I was lucky to have gotten a super modern and sleek washroom. The sinks and shower had an extremely unique touch to it and reflected the monochromatic theme greatly. Even the telephone had received a modern upgrade and was a sweet low-profile cordless docking phone, a huge difference from the old yellowed corded phones you see in most hotels, even in the big-names along the Strip.

Pretty much everything was spotless except for a few unwipeable smudges on the couch and a few black streaks along the white ceiling, but I really can't complain when every other hotel I've experienced within the sub-$150 price range have, for the most part, been MUCH worse.

From my years of vacationing in Vegas, the Hard Rock hotel has surprised me the most and has provided the best bang for my buck. For a budget friendly option and those who don't mind being a few blocks away from the strip, I would very much recommend staying here!",2,0,1

We did a quick rate check and Hard Rocks were good and Sunday low. We arrived at check in and thought we hit the jackpot when the girl working the desk handed us a note saying she was putting us in a huge suite instead of the regular room we had booked ** 5 Stars for her being a cool chick! The room itself was beautiful, separate living and bedroom areas, massive multiperson shower etc, etc. 

My problems with this place are: 

The Casino because, its tiny and lame, its the Casino that nobody I know ever seems to win at. Its filled with puking 21 year olds in affliction gear that make talking texting teenagers in movie theaters seem like a pleasant dream. The restaurant selection inside is awful, no matter what you go with, your basically choosing the lesser of two evils, ie. Denny's vs. IHOP, who wants either one? Not me ever, and especially not in Vegas. 

And the POOL. Since we were there on a Sunday we decided to check out the infamous Rehab, its free for guests and the non Rehab side of the pool was filled with the little screaming kids, who brings their kids to Vegas, especially to the Hardrock on Rehab Sunday no less, I don't know and honestly I don't think I want to... but I digress........10 minutes and two ridiculously over priced Mai Tais later we realized we were better off with the screaming kids. At least they are kids and their screams make sense. The rehab side was filled with the same 21 year old douches that had been puking in the casino the night before, pounding more shots to ensure more puking and scantily clad drunk girls, which I don't have a problem with at all, I love to see my girls having a good time, what I do mind is a girl in a thong with half a chichi hanging out screaming at the top of her lungs ""OH MY GOD BITCH"" and ""AAAAAAAH I THINK SOMEBODIES TRYING TO GRAB MY ASS"" really? really? really? no really? I know your drunk but you were probably sober when you slid into that dental floss- it didn't occur to you then that wearing it to a pool full of drunk men would be a problem? 

At first I thought I was just getting old and crotchety, but then I realized, I love to party, I love drinking, and I even love drunks. I just like drunks that can handle their liquor and still have a good time. Being at the Hardrock is like when you have a party at your place and one of your friends brings some blow hard date that nobody knows, he runs his mouth all night, brags about how many shots he did last weekend, shows off his tribal arm band tattoos and then he throws up all over your living room floor. Nobody likes that guy, He's a total buzz kill and so is the Hardrock.",5,10,5

Apparently you have to put the key in just right and then pull they key out as slowly as possible for the door to open. 

Once in the room the beds were uncomfortable and hard as a rock. The bathroom was run down. Shower curtain was completely wrinkled, the floor looked dirty, the drain to the shower was broken in and the wall was exposed around the shower head. Once you got the door closed you got to see how the painter who painted the room didn't care as there was paint splashes and smears all over the door.

***ROOM***
I was happy with our pool-view room in the Casino tower. Our standard room was pretty spacious (500 sq. ft.?) with a few noteworthy amenities: an iHome and a bed as fluffy as clouds. The room could have skipped out on the portrait of some rockstar, who kept freaking me out each time I caught a glimpse of it.

We booked the place with the intention to recuperate from our weekend at EDC. Instead, I felt like we were part of the Rehab party. We were fine with that too... it kept the party going. Even with our balcony door closed, we could still feel the vibration of the bass from the pool party. :)

***SERVICE***
Before even entering our rooms, I had already received subpar service --
My hotel package came with a comp bottle of hard A + $40 food and drink credit. While checking in, the receptionist was ready to send me on my merry way with just the room keys, until I had to ask for my vouchers. Though he corrected the mistake, he seemed the least bit apologetic, and even judgmental, like I was freeloading off them... um no! just asking for what I paid! I would not even have to ask if I had received it in the first place!

The second day, we slept through ""Tidy Up"" time, so I called Guest Services to replenish our tissues, amenities, and towels stock later that night. Housekeeping came 10 minutes later with towels, and a bag with two sets of amenities, but minus the soap. I never saw the box of tissues either D: I guess I'll be better prepared with my own amenities next time. 

***OVERALL*** 
Great view of the pool and back of the strip, especially at night, but this is the last time I am booking a standard room here on my own free will. I would be open to staying at a HRH Tower Suite on a future visit. From pictures, the Suite looks similar to the ones at Vdara.

Out of control drunks everywhere. People not wearing shoes or socks in the casino floor! Don't get me wrong. It's Vegas but I couldn't believe the trash allowed in the hotel\/casino. We ended up upgrading our room (for a charge of corse.) Decided to just spend the night in our room and not deal with downstairs. Got comfortable and turned the TV to find out it didn't work. Called the front desk and was told that engineering would be right up. 30 minutes or so later we got a knock at the door. He explained that the TV was out and that he would change it out the next day for us. Noon was best time for us as we knew we wouldn't be in the room while they did it. The next day we went on with our day to other hotels. Came back to our room to find our room cleaned up and the New TV on and the replacment has clearly been done. Now here it is... While my wife is getting ready in the bathroom and I'm in the shower my wife sees in the mirror a man standing in our room. Yes. The guy from engineering is now standing in our living room at 7:45PM for no reason at all. We heard no knock and no ""hello?!"" ""Are you there?!"" Nothing at all. From the fear on her face I could clearly see we weren't alone and came bursting out of the shower in the nude to great this hotel employee, intruder in our room. He offered no apology and said he knocked. He said he was checking up on the TV because he had read on a report it wasn't replaced. I knew that was a lie as the TV was brand new, working, was left on and was clearly replaced. I told him it was fine and asked him to leave. I called the front desk to let them know about the incident and they again offered no apologies and offered me a $50 good credit. I couldn't believe it. I was shocked. Here we have a hotel employee not only come into the room unannounced but is found starring at a women in the mirror. My wife makes out what it is in shock and doesn't move or anything for a while to have him just staring at her getting ready and the front desk manager doesn't think this is a issue and offers half a dinner for it?

I was told if I talked to security that I could no longer talk to front desk about this incident and they couldn't offer us anything. Seeing that all they offered me was $50 food credit they weren't doing anything in the first place. I asked to speak to security. After calling them to the front desk twice a gentleman (Jeff) showed up. I explained the situation to him. He said I could open a formal complaint but the choice was mine. I don't see why they wouldn't look into this themselves without my complaint but ok. We each made gave a written statement and were then offered a phone to speak to a manager. Stephanie who was the manager on duty told me she was going to comp our upgrade of $35 a night and also the $25 a night resort fees. She couldn't comp the room charges for us because we booked through a 3rd party. I didn't book the room. My wife did. For my birthday so I didn't know at the time but that wasn't true. We booked it on the Hard Rock website. 
I called the day after we got home to asked about what charges we had. Our room was booked with a credit card and the charge of $172.51 was already charged but when we arrived I used my debit card. Now my debit card was also charged $226 plus another $6 as well as $85 for a dinner and a $52 charge for brunch.  I spoke to the manager on duty Tod. Explained everything to him and that Stephanie said I booked through a 3rd party otherwise she would have comp'd the stay and he said he didn't think the TV not working or having a employee walk in on us in the shower was a good enough reason to comp our stay. He said he would comp the two $35 upgrade fees and the two $25 resort fees. He had no idea what the $6 charge was and offered no explanation for it. He seemed very upset to even be on the phone with me. He explained that he had the power to comp the stay but felt he didn't think it was deserved. He said he would charge me only the $172.51 and I I had a issue with it I could contact David Rodrigez from the legal department. I was told I would get a email from Tod. 12 hours later I have received nothing at all and still have all pending charges (over $369) on my debit card as well as the $172.51 from my credit card. 

:SHORT VERSION:
So in short if you want to have a hotel employee have the right to watch you in the nude, watch him not only walk into your room unannounced but also sit and stair at you in the nude at 7:45pm then book your stay in Vegas here at hard rock. Good luck. I hope it doesn't traumatize you or your loved one like it has mine.",4,1,0

So, we searched around Priceline to find a good deal. We planned on checking in on Sunday and checking out on Monday in March. Lo and behold, we found a Priceline deal for $29 for Hard Rock. Even though, we knew it was not on the Strip, we couldn't pass up on a $29 deal. We knew that the check in time was 3 PM, but the last few times we have been to Vegas, most hotels have let us check in early especially when it's not peak time. We got to the hotel around 2 PM and when we attempted to check in, they said the rooms were not yet available. Boo. However, they did let us ""check in"" and we just had to pick up our keys at 3. (There is a separate line just to pick up the keys so you do not need to stand in the check in line again). 

Our hotel room was nice but the bathrooms needs renovations. We saw cracks on the bathroom walls. The parking lot is not too far from the rooms, which is great as there are some hotels (ahem, MGM) which makes you walk miles from the parking lot. It is a little far from the Strip and I definitely would not recommend walking as it seems a little seedy. We found out that there is a shuttle between the hotel and the Strip, but it only runs until 5 PM, so we had to drive. Overall, not a bad experience for a last minute trip. Oh, for those of you using Priceline, the rate does not include resort fee and tax.",9,2,4

I had the misfortune of staying at this property during the Mayweather fight weekend (May 1st-4th).  I was excitedly looking foward to the Rehab pool party event on Sunday, where Ludacris was expected to perform.  I purchased tickets at the hotel box office in advance, only to have the event cancelled due to a brawl that took place.  When I asked for a refund, I was directed to their box office which ""happened"" to be closed and would not re-open that day.

Aside from the failed event, the lack of organization, rudeness of the staff and terrible treatment of guests made my stay one I will never forget, for all the wrong reasons. 

My non-smoking room reeked of smoke when I checked in and the hotel would only offer a downgraded room in its place.

Did I mention all hotel guests were barricaded from entry to the property for several hours?  They literally placed metal barricades in front of all the entrances and would not let anyone (hotel guests included) into the hotel.

This is unaccceptable.  I would hate to think this is standard protocol for handling guests when there is a disturbance.  But I would hate even more to think this is not standard protocol and only ""certain specific"" guests are treated this way.    Either way, I will not return.

First let me say I was a big fan of the place. Cool vibe, great characters, just a fun hotel to stay when in Vegas. Never coming back. 
The warning signs started with the reservation process. I booked our suite and connecting room ( 4 people) two weeks in advance hoping  it would be enough, but since the hotel was hosting the AVN's  the entire HRH tower was booked. The only suites they had were at the Casino tower, their oldest one, but I said what the hell. 
Back to my phone experience, first time I called I was put on hold for 7 minutes. Hung up. Called again immediately and was put on hold again, waited 5 minutes and realizing were this was going, hung up. Third time a charm, finally got a very bitter and angry reservationist. Talking to an automated system would have actually been an improvement.  Doesn't matter, Mission accomplish, I got the rooms. 
We arrived on Friday. Knowing that check in was at 3pm, we took our time leaving LA and got to the hotel around 4:30pm. Upon check in the friendly receptionist informed me that our suite and connecting room were not really connected, only one next to each other. I explained to her that I made the reservation two weeks in advance, and that I am hosting friends from Europe who traveled many miles to be here. We don't really have the option to brush it off and come back another weekend. She explained to me that rooms are based upon availability and since the hotel is so busy they don't have the rooms we requested. If someone would have communicated it to me upon making the reservation, I would have gladly left LA earlier, but I guess I shouldn't expected much from Mrs. Scrooge over the phone.
So, we walked into the rooms and it took me about 2 minutes to realize that our ""Suite"" looked significantly smaller then I imagined. I booked the ""Deluxe Suite"" which is supposed to be 900+ square ft. What we had was something slightly bigger then our ""connecting"" room. Determined to figure this out I called the front desk, and guess what? I was put on hold for almost ten minutes. Second try, same. I finally got someone to pick up after the third call. 
Upon explaining the situation the receptionist apologized and informed me that since a few guests decided to extend their stay, our room will not be available until tomorrow. At this point there was nothing to do so we just rolled with the punches, the only thing I asked for was a mini fridge that none of the rooms were equipped with.
Now let me give you a brief description of our rooms and the state we found them. This is supposedly after a 100 million renovation. Bathrooms were filthy, and I mean disgusting. Unrecognizable stuff sticking to the walls ( it looked like bee wax), chipped mirrors, uneven paint job, shower head sticking out of the wall half hanging. My friend took a bath and it took about 2 hours for it to drain. Oh well, we had a fun night around town, and looked forward to our rooms the next day. Btw, fridge never arrived.
Second day came. Our connecting room was ready by 1230pm, the suite however was not. After calling and stopping at the front desk for at least four times we finally got our room at 430pm! 4 hours after the next door room was ready. We also asked again for the mini fridge. These rooms were in a slightly better condition the others. Most annoying thing was that all the flat screens TV's in both rooms had a fuzzy and uneven picture. The playoffs were on and we wanted to watch the game in our rooms since the sports bar downstairs was packed. Alas, the picture was so bad you couldn't even tell the numbers on the player's jerseys. Oh yea, and we never got that mini fridge. 
Upon checkout I explained all of our trials and misfortunes to a very nice receptionist (Angela). She was very sympathetic but couldn't really offer anything so I asked to speak to the manager. 
The manager came out (Patricia) with a look on her face that pretty much said everything. She looked at me as if I was trying to scam her. I explained to her again, everything that happen and what a bad experience this entire stay left upon me and my friends. I also mentioned that I work in the hospitality business ( I am a GM in a large restaurant group in LA) so I am very surprised that the hotel didn't even offer to comp us a night. We ate, drank and gambled in the hotel. Paid a hefty sum for our rooms, we could have got better rooms for less money at the Cosmopolitan or the Palms Place that have amazing suits for very moderate prices. Patricia informed me that we already received a $400 discount on the rooms. My claim that $200 from the amount was because of the difference in room rates, since we got a lesser room on our first night, fell on deaf ears. Patricia would not budge.

All I have to say to myself about that is: Why the hell did I wait so long to do so? From the moment I arrived to the Reservations counter to the time I checked out, I've never had such a smooth and comfortable stay. I got a corner room in the Paradise Tower on the 16th floor and was greeted with the best view I've had in Vegas. The left hand floor to ceiling window showed the 2 HRH pools while the right hand side window showed the LV Strip in all its glory. Another plus is that there were fewer drunken idiots there than I thought there would be! I saw people of all ages there, including this cute couple in their 60's hanging out at Center Bar Thursday night watching the NBA game. I've read previous posts about how comfortable the beds are here and have to agree 100% with them. It's not the best I've ever slept in but it ranks up in my top 5. 

While there I ate at Mr Lucky's, which is a personal fav of mine in Vegas. For players club members, the $4.99 steak & egg Graveyard special and the $7.77 Steak & Shrimp Gambler's special cannot be beat. (NOTE: They recently changed the hours for the Graveyard special from Midnight to Noon to Midnight to 8am). I also ate at Pink Taco which was pretty good but not spectacular. They have a pretty good happy hour special for 99 cents tacos and margaritas between 1-3pm and 9-11pm Monday through Thursday, I didn't get around to Johnny' Smalls for their AYCE Tapas but that is on my to do list for next time (NOTE: it's in the HRH Tower casino portion of the complex; I saw more than a few people walking down the corridor where the shops and some restaurants are looking for it). 

This brings me to the only ""complaint"" I have about this place. Anywhere you go inside a LV Casino, you see signs after signs directing you to restaurants, hotel towers, etc but none at the HRH. In the past, it was a pretty easy place to navigate since it was all in the round, so to speak but since the 2 expansions and renovations have doubled the size of it all, it would be a good idea to have better directions to give customers and guests on where to go (the property map they give you upon check in is good but really, how often is it looked at after you first get to your room and head out?).

First, booked a room with a king-sized bed and then was promptly told at check-in that they only had two doubles available. Second, after arriving in the room (on the 3rd floor) I noticed that half of the lights were broken and dirty (dust everywhere) and the floors and bathroom were also dirty. 

Next, no one mentioned that apparently if you are on a lower level you will feel and hear the bass from the casino music until all hours of the night. Finally, around 2am I called the front desk because it was impossible to sleep with the noise and the front desk moved us to the 2nd floor because of course 'nothing else was available' but farther away from the casino and over Starbucks instead of the casino. Fortunately, the room was a bit quieter but unfortunately, a hell of a lot uglier and dirtier (half of the items in the mini bar were missing...dear God please don't let me get charged) with pistachio shells sprinkled about the entire room. Also, just as an FYI for you late sleepers, if your room faces the pool (even though it's winter and empty) they start blaring music from the loudspeakers at about 8am until God knows when at night. Really? I know this is Hard Rock Hotel but please respect your guest a bit better! I could really do without listening to Katy Perry yodeling over the loud speakers at 9am that are 3 inches from the room window. 

Overall, I was completely unimpressed with the hotel, the room, and the service. I will never stay at this hotel again. If you are unlucky enough to have to stay at the hotel, I highly recommend checking in early and demanding a room on a higher level (although I hear the top levels have a lot of airplane noise).

On a last note, refrain from ordering room service. I ordered room service for breakfast and I have never in my life been charged $26 (because of course all orders charge for a delivery fee and 20% gratuity) for 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, a clump of hashbrowns, and nasty bacon.

It seemed a decent place with a good vibe and reasonably priced. Besides paying a resort fee for every day we reserved  through our booking.com reservation, we then paid a second flat resort fee on top before leaving. Yet, that wasn't the worst part of our stay. The worst was having housekeeping or some staff with access to our room, rummage through our belongings (glad we use the in-room safe) and use the in-room convenience pay items on the dresser.  These items which we would've been billed for but my boyfriend had noticed items were moved as soon as we walked in from the wedding ceremony. Shady. Guest services was good enough to take off the charge but I'm not sure that would be true if we didn't notice & call down right away. So we went back and looked at our luggage and saw that it had obviously been gone through. All of this left a bad taste and I can't say I'd stay there again.",0,0,0

Service was A+ for me.  Very pleasant stay.  Would definitely consider again with or without the upgrade .

The style is contemporary meets French Provencal. The rooms are clean and crisp. Good looking. I am not sure if it was just our room but there was a lot of creaking, cracking and snapping coming out of the ductwork. Slightly annoying.

We found it super humorous that there were giant ""towel bars"" over the beds and couch but not one in the bathroom (ok so there was ONE in the bathroom, over the tub and not near the sink). The full-length mirror is right by the front door inside the closet so you have to hold the door open while you are trying to make sure you look good for the night.

The wall ipod docking system is cool. However, the music only comes from the unit hooked up to the TV so it has to be turned way up to hear it in the bathroom so you can jam out in your underoos while you get ready to go out and play.

Beds are nice. Place was clean. The guest service left something to be desired though. We called down for some help with the safe b\/c it kept saying error. It took 2hrs and two phone calls for anyone to come up. We called for more glassware and it showed up... AFTER we left the room for the evening more than an hour later. I asked for a room tag so they would stop knocking on our door and I never got it (so I stole my neighbors).

I like the smaller casino. The dealers are friendly. Mr. Lucky's is actually a decent diner and a great place to people watch. Tried to eat at Rare 120 but they were closed on Mondays so didn't check it out. People who complain about it being off the strip are a little ridiculous. You could walk to PH, Aria etc if you wanted to OR you can catch a $7 cab. Not a big deal at all.

We avoided Rehab but did go out to the new pool deck on Sunday. Also good people watching. $9 for a beer though.... OUCH.

The staff is rude when and if they even acknowledge you. The rooms are not near the quality they advertise and seem dirty and not maintained well. The toilet was stained and dirty. Outside the window on a ledge was a large collection of garbage. 

The minibar is weight sensitive and the prices are ridiculous as well. The price for anything within the casino or hotel is way too high, it's like because of their horrible location they think they can make you pay twice as much. If you must stay go across the street to the CVS for anything you may need. 

The staff was plain out rude. And the girl at check out tried to make us pay a higher rate when we checked out than what we were told when we booked and the price when we had checked in. She went and spoke with her manager and  then spoke to us as it was clearly there in the contract and our fault. When I pointed out that if it was in the contract that she could see, why did the two previous people we had spoke to gave us the lower price? She had no answer and offered no apology then she said wait a minute and left to talk to the manager for the second time who never bothered to even make an appearance and came back to find out we were charged incorrectly and she never once apologized. When we mentioned how disappointed with the hotel we were she just ignored us as if nothing happened. 

To top it off there is no hot tub unless you rent a cabana. The pools are only open until dark if they open at all. And the staff won't even acknowledge you exist even if you are wondering looking lost which is fairly easy to do. It may be different if you are a female in a bikini as it was mostly male staff.

And in the same new tower (HRH) where we'd have our own check-in area and could avoid the huge line again. Score! 

The suites are spacious and gorgeous, mine with small jacuzzi tub in bathroom and jack and jill sinks. Flatscreen tvs (2) in my room, one on living room side and one on bedroom side. Music system throughout the room that includes tunes or you can hook in your iphone\/ipod. Little wet bar in both rooms which we used a lot. There are 5 pools including a sand bottom pool, Breathe which is a glass bottom and has late night entertainment, and the famous Rehab pool which is always a party. There's even blackjack you can play IN THE POOL. We didn't go to Vanity (nightclub) but Pauly D is their resident DJ. What an amazing hotel!

I wasn't feeling well from the heat a couple days so it was great to be able to entertain in our room during the day. I had about 8 friends up and ordered room service for lunch which wasn't ridiculously priced. The casino and restaurants are great, very classy. Two affordable restaurants, but even the diner has a great menu. Hard Rock is a block off the strip but I didn't feel like we needed to leave much. We went to dinner\/clubs off property twice and our total cab fare was about $30. Not bad.

Only complaints were that my Internet (which is supposed to be included) wouldn't easily connect and they don't like for you to bring food\/drinks up to your room. The valet was rude one time when they were backed up and we were waiting in the heat. And one pool security guard was a jerk. All other staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

Check in is at 3pm and we got there early. They said no rooms were available but after I put up a little fuss (after all it was my bachelorette) Jose Mari was able to get us a room right away. He also gave us some coupons that we could use around the hotel and casino. Thank you Jose!!

We went up to our suite with a pool view in the HRH tower and settled in. It was a little run down but comfortable enough and considering the rate I got for the room, the price was right! 
The suite very comfortably can fit 4 people...but you could squeeze 6-8. The bathroom was large and had a huge tub and shower. The beds were comfortable, but nothing special. Overall it was clean. 

The casino is small and kinda lame. They have a few restaurants, we tried Pink Taco, it was ok. Room service pizza was perfect after a night of clubs. LOVED the pool!! Both the hotel ""family"" pool and the Rehab ""party"" pool are great. Love how they both have sand on the bottom. You really don't feel like you are at a pool in Vegas when your feet are in the sand. Very nice! Also prices for cabanas were reasonable.

The room was beautiful, with a shitload of pillows to fight, I mean sleep with.  The lighting in the bathroom was very forgiving, perfect for your late-night face.  Room service was speedy and courteous.  I wish I could tell you about the gym, like I was all packed to continue my workout regimen, but I was uh...sidetracked.  Friggin' Vegas.

However; the plastic people at Rehab and drug scene is no longer my thing. What it reminds me of is MTV's Spring Break show (filmed in Daytona Beach, FL). 
Don't get me wrong, the place is awesome - especially the pool. Who doesn't mind running into a rock star now and then?? My friend met Tommy Lee and Vince Neil in the casino - on 2 separate occasions and we met  the band AFI at our blackjack table. It's a crap shoot (no pun intended) but if you are going to see anyone famous in Vegas, it'll probably be here. 
I love having a balcony that faces the pool...but only when I am pre-funking and getting ready to go out. Try taking a hangover nap midday in that same room and you will be screaming for a cot in a janitors closet, if it means peace and quiet.
I'm surprised they still have balconies, considering the suicide rate in Vegas, but the view from each is totally killer! Again, no pun intended. 
I have no idea if the buffet is any good, because we eat every meal at the Pink Taco. Why? Because I could eat Taco Bell every day and this is like TB times ten! The prices aren't bad either. 
Honestly, the only sucky thing about the Hard Rock - if I had to come up with something - is the jaunt to the strip. Sure, you can catch a cab...but that's money that should be spent by the pool. On $15 drinks. Yeah, that sucks too...but who wants to be inside gambling to get free watered down drinks when you can have a drink in your hand as you experience ""Rehab"" (pool party). 
Body English (formerly ""Babies"") is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas...as well it had better be - to keep people from jumping into said cabs to the strip.

Anyways, this hotel is a little bit off the strip which was very inconvenient and their prices were the same as hotels on the strip. The casino didn't have a lot of slot options and is fairly small. The pool is great though but it was closed over the weekend because it turned into a day club. Overall, the stay was ok but I wouldn't stay here again because of the location and the lack of good games in the casino.",1,0,0

Yeah, you probably don't want to come here to gamble, but if to-be-seen is your goal then I suggest staying here. 

A few highlights:

The rooms in the Paradise Tower were well appointed with showers that could hold several people, if you know what I'm talkin about ;) The beds and pillows were heavenly and put me right to sleep at 5:30 in the morning (although the time and exhaustion could have helped with that too.) And like others have said, do not move anything in the mini bar cuz it is monitored by weight sensors. I unfortunately did not take up the chance to see the rooms in HRH, but heard they were as awesome as the ones in PT.

I was bummed that I missed out on Wolfmother Friday night at Rehab, the incredibly decked out pool party at the hotel. I did spend some time at Skybar on Sunday though, dancing and drinking the afternoon away with the bachelor party I met up with earlier that morning. Compared to Rehab it was much more tame, however still a cockfest in its own right. I would have liked to hit up Rehab instead, but by the time we got there we heard entrance fees went up to $150 for guys. Obviously for 7 guys they were not gonna do this and we ended up at the $0 entrance fee Skybar.

I'm not sure how prices are usually for this hotel...drinks, food, or standard room pricing... cuz I stayed, ate and drank for free. One friend got his room for an insane deal at $39 and another got his for $69 both online and both two-double standard bed rooms. For those prices, I would gladly stay here because they come with wristbands for Rehab each night you're staying and if you're staying the weekend -- Awesome!!!!!",6,4,5

We could see all the pools and part of the strip near the Luxor.

I really suggest the paradise tower!!!! Walk in shower that could easily fit 4 people so it's nice a roomy. Double sinks and a nice sized closet and drawers.

We decided to cancel our flights and take a drive from SoCal so that I could bring a cooler with very specific foods, I am gluten and dairy free.  Upon arrival, we waited for valet for 15 minutes and we were one of two cars there. There was no one around.  Finally Fox greeted us, he was very sweet unlike a lot of the other staff. However, he mentioned that they have a new ""no cooler"" policy and that we could not bring it into the hotel. Since we drove specifically so that we could bring stuff for my dietary needs, my husband and I were not happy campers. One of the bellhops said that the new rule is stated online when you reserve a room, but since we booked with AAA there was no such warning. We checked in and then waited for security to get the OK to bring in the food. We waited another 25 minutes before security came to talk to us. About 10 minutes into the wait time, I had asked a manager how much longer it would be - his response, ""Sit tight."" After a 4 hour drive and a pain in the ass check-in, all we wanted to do was go to the pool and have a few libations. Finally, Caesar approved the food we had and sent up a mini fridge to the room so we had to unpack the food into our suitcases and then wheel it up so there was no sign of a cooler in the hotel. Lame. We also had wine in the trunk and decided to put that in our suitcase and then the bellhop who was so unhelpful from the start, again said that we can't be taking that into the hotel, all while other people were bringing in bags of booze and food from CVS. We said we got the OK and ended up taking our stuff to the room on our own, which was very far away from the entrance. We were in the Paradise Tower.  The decor of the room was nice, but our room was so dusty! I have photos to prove it! We had housekeeping come in to dust everything and then they also had the air filter changed(apparently it was filthy), but while doing so they bumped the sensor with the snacks and water on it so we had $210 in charges on our statement.  I disputed it and had it removed but that was just another thing to add to our less than fabulous trip. Thank God I had checked that before checking out. On Sunday, a non-Rehab Sunday, there was still a $50 food\/beverage charge if you wanted to sit by the main pool. We had just finished eating at the Culinary Dropout (THIS WAS THE ONLY GOOD PART ABOUT THE HOTEL) so we weren't about to spend another $50 each to sit in a chair. 

All around, we were very disappointed.

Also, I didn't read any other reviews, as I just want to write my own and not be persuaded one way or the other. All I ever heard in the past about the ""Hard Rock"" was it was mainly for a younger crowd, not that I am old, but I am not in my 20's, honestly that's what I was accepting to see throughout the casino and hotel: some groups of college guys, walking slightly tilted to one side with a beer in their hand, hoping to make it to their room. The parking attendances were all so very friendly, and accommodating! We walked in and the first thing I noticed was how clean the place was. Spotless and it smells clean as well, not some oversized smoked out dingy and out dated casino that you immediately wanted to take a can of Lysol to. Checking in, the front desk gal was also equality as friendly and helpful! And off we went to our rooms. Now, this was the ""test"" for me...... opening the door to our room, the first thing that popped into my head, was how fresh the room smelled, I couldn't detect smoke at all,  I am not even sure if this was a smoking room or non-smoking room, do they even have non-smoking rooms in LV? In addiction, the halls on getting to our room didn't smell as well (side note) love the decor of the hall ways! That was a plus in my book! The room it's self was....

1.    Decorated so hip, in patterns of black and gray, which I loved!
2.    The king size bed, was done in white, with crisp sheets, the thread count must have been up there, as it felt like sleeping in butter!
3.    The pillows were perfect!
4.    The shower pressure was great, no complaints!
5.    Room service was on time, and friendly!

The next morning I ordered the same thing except I received what I was supposed to get  last night the real Texas toast  and it was garnishes with fruit on the side....I also ordered a Ceasar salad and turkey burger. The Ceasar salad came already tossed in the dressing which resulted in soggy lettuce. The grilled chicken that I asked for in addition was undercooked then there was absolutely no Parmesan at all in the salad. My burger was okay, but I've definitely had better ones from here before.

In the morning shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, noticed that it was coming between the glass seal and tile seams. Had to use both large towels to get the water up, then maid said she had no large towels. Told maid about leaking shower and she grunted. Went down to coffee shop and was told they have no decaf. Went down to pool area and only two open pools, so overcrowded and loud. If you are going to go to Vegas to enjoy your stay I recommend elsewhere.",0,1,0

From the second you walk into the lobby, you're greeted by a sea of 20 something's that are hammered regardless of what time it is. I came here for a bachelor party a few years ago, so this pretty much fit the mood of what everyone was going for.

We stayed in the celebrity suite which was huge. It's a one bedroom suite that comes with a huge living room, dining area and another (optional) attached room with two queen beds. There are floor to ceiling doors  that open up to birds eye view of the massive pool where parties are hosted, including the world famous, Rehab party of Sundays. There was also a large leather couch with plenty of other seating in the room.  For five dudes, it worked out perfectly. Rooms aren't anything modern, but there's good enough.

The main issue with this hotel is it's off the beaten path. You definitely need a taxi to get to the strip and there's pretty much nothing else around the hotel. If you're coming to Vegas to do the strip and want to be around a higher standard clientele (and have the money), you're much better off at the Cosmo or Bellagio. If you're mainly in Vegas for Rehab and are in you're 20's, this is the place for you!",7,1,1

Wish I hadn't. When I went to the sports books I was looking to put money on the Rockets and Cavs and the guy behind the counter laughed at me saying there was no basketball that weekend. A little weird since he's running bets on it. There was another girl behind the counter who was laughing at me trying to bet on basketball to the point of it just being weird. I ended up putting money on the Texans game but really wish I had gone elsewhere to do it. 

So, gets worse for me. My guy was at a bachelor party for his friend getting married the next day(why we were in Vegas) and I decided to enjoy my first time in Vegas and have a cocktail after I bet. I love rock music and all the memorabilia but, man oh man, the bartenders in the center bar under the globe after you enter last Friday night were just....so rude. When I walked up there was a taller, blondish guy who actually almost seemed mad I was there(they weren't busy anyway, I can see why now) and asked what he could get me. I figured since I was going to watch the A&M game I'd go with my home rooted, southern theme and get a sweet tea on the rocks. So I tell him this and he makes a face at me like I have 2 heads and says ""....aaaaaand?"" There's more? For one person? I stayed nice and said, ""well some lemon if you've got it."" Then he just stared at me for a second and said ""I need to see your id."" I really should have just walked away at this point after not getting a any form of a greeting or at least a polite form of asking what I'd like or to see my ID. He got my drink and just put it in front of me and said ""twelve."" Heinous price for just one drink but it's Vegas so I said whatever and put down $12. Were I a person who liked to really stick it to rude people I would have put down 12 pennies to make a point. There were other bartenders but the only name I remember was Matt who seemed the least rude out of all and he at least seemed to be in a semi okay mood and was kind of whistling and singing along with the music like I was.. 

So I was alone my first time in Vegas and could have used SOMEONE with a good attitude while I watched the game so when the guy next to me asked me to swap seats with his friend so they could be together I said okay. After I swapped seats that guy's friend had left his beer and I was nice and let him know it was still over there. It was a fresh beer he hadn't even touched so I figured he'd want it! I joked with them and said ooh you can just leave it with me for swapping and laughed and so did they and said no really, sweetheart, you can keep that we actually can't stay. I told them no and was about to bring it to him but before I could even reach out to snag it as I was standing up( I actually think it was Matt) comes over and grabs the beer without a word and puts it down aggressively in front of the guy who kinda looked at me like ""sorry."" At this rate I'm assuming all the men behind the counter hate women? I also had no drink in front of me anymore and nobody came around to ask if I needed anything else. At that point the extremely hammered guy next to me waved a bartender down and they finally came over. This guy tried to pay for my drink too since I was having a crappy time but I wouldn't let him. The bartender STILL didn't say anything when he put my drink down but boy they sure wanted my money and a tip! I eventually just got up and left which is too bad I was enjoying the music and watching A&M dominate. 

I seriously can't believe the experience I had here. I called the manager the next day but I really am just so irritated at how these bartenders on 1\/4 handled a customer I just had to Yelp. I actually wanted to leave Vegas that night after having this be my first experience but I had to stay for the wedding and luckily people were incredibly nice at the other places I went including, Rumor, my hotel and, ironically, the Hard Rock Cafe on the corner in front of the hotel and casino. I wish I could just ask these guys, ""really...what was your problem?"" I wasn't even buzzed so not like I was an annoying, drunk patron and I don't believe in treating people poorly so it would have been nice to get the same respect that I tried to give them.",1,0,0

Oddly enough, its location near the strip (but not ON the Strip) leaves it quite empty most nights. I think people who actually want to gamble in Vegas go to the nearby Strip, so the casino is rarely busy. Kind of a bummer if you like a fun, busy atmosphere in your casinos. 

I don't think the Hard Rock was particularly prepared for our convention, as attendees (and poor other guests caught in the mix) had to stand in line for almost an hour to check in---and then, since there were no rooms available, had to stand in line AGAIN for half an hour to 45 minutes to secure a key once a room became available. We also had to stand in line for for 30-45 minutes to secure coffee and a ""quick"" breakfast at the Dunkin' Donuts (again, maybe not the place for a convention?). But the other restaurants on the premises were pretty good---the pizza place, Mr. Lucky's, Culinary Dropout, Pink Taco. 

Only one pool was open for most of the week, despite more than 1,000 women descending on the hotel (not enough visitors to warrant opening other pools, they said). It was OK, but easily felt crowded and was lacking in chairs. When the other pools finally did open, we made the mistake of attempting to visit Rehab, the ""cool"" pool with the swim-up bar. You have to access it through the parking garage, your gear is checked for---whatever it is they're checking for (weapons? food?), and then you're sent out into an alley between the buildings to get into the pool. Weird. And, yeah, if you don't look like you could be in a music video, you're likely not cool enough for that pool. We quickly scurried back to the other too-busy, old-people pool, immediately regretting we were marked with a waterproof Rehab stamp. Mrph.

The rooms themselves were well appointed, but DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH ANYTHING! Everything on and in the minibar has a sensor, and if you so much as TOUCH it you'll be charged for it. I'm not kidding---TOUCH NOTHING. The casino wasn't hazy-smoky like I've seen some (probably because it was mostly empty), but when our air was on at night (all night, every night, blowing right onto my bed in a most uncomfortable way), it seemed to pump the smoke smell right into our non-smoking room. Ugh. I felt gross and smoky most of the week. 

But, yeah, rock memorabilia is cool. So if you're visiting Vegas to stay in a boring, expensive hotel where you can see David Bowie's jacket, Jerry Garcia's ponytail (seriously), and Britney's ""Hit Me Baby (One More Time)"" schoolgirl costume, then this may be the place for you.",0,0,0

This is a spot for college or young folk ready to drink and dance at the pool area, great spot for that.  Not so great for families though.

Our issues were brought to the hotels attention and we were moved to a nicer room. Attempts to rectify any frustration was made with a cabana for the day and $50 food voucher (so a cheeseburger) Although this was appreciated it wasn't something we could enjoy as we had already spent time at the pool (advised security at 9am that was what we were doing). When we initially brought our ""findings"" to their attention they advised we would be moved and our bags placed in our new rooms ""so go enjoy the pool"" per security. Around 1pm i Re-checked in to the new room and upon arrival realized our stuff had not delivered. We rolled with it and simply waited for them to retrieve our belongings (45 mins) Another call made from HRH mgmt and they offered to pay for our last nights stay and bump food voucher to $100. We Politely accepted the offer and heard them out as they explained this was a common thing although not something they like to see or have happen. 

This trip is one to go into record books for us. Husband had phone stolen at pool, critters in our pillows, $15 cocktails by pool that we had to retrieve ourselves and me splitting open my toe in the pool. Needless to say this Not something I expected when I chose to stay at the Hard Rock. This will be my first and last stay with them.......when we had issues at the Golden Nugget years ago we had the mgmt team doing all they could to redeem themselves.

He noticed it was my birthday when he was looking at my license, and he put us in the HRH Tower, which is an all-suite wing of the hotel.  Awesome!  Thanks Ariel!

The room was awesome.  We were on the 3rd floor, which gave us a wonderful view of a roof and the parking garage ;), but who are we to complain?  The room was about 700-sq-ft, and had a separate living and bedroom area.  The beds were SUPER comfy!  The living room had a neat touchscreen music system on the wall, which was built in with all different genres of music that played through a speaker by the TV.  You could also plug in your own device, which was a nice touch.  The bathroom was great!  Double sinks, and a separate bathrub (huge) and shower (huge).  The shower had an awesome rainfall showerhead.

We did not check out too much of the property, but the separate check-in area for the HRH Tower was a nice touch, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.

The only downside was the confusion of the light system in the bathroom.  It was SO dark in there the first night, and we could barely see anything.  Obviously we could have called the front desk, but we were too tired.  We also couldn't figure out how to use the rain showerhead either, but the other showerhead was still great.  We did go by the front desk the second day, and the agent let us know that there was a master switch by the front door that controls the light in the bathroom.

It's not for families or for people who get annoyed by a younger crowd.  The best feature would probably be the pool (especially their Sunday Rehab party).

Some things to consider before making your reservation:

PROS: 
- Younger crowd.
- The casino is a giant party scene.
- Rooms don't look dated.
- The pool area has good scenery if you know what I mean.
- Music memorabilia throughout the casino.
- Really nice fitness center.
- On-site concert venue.
- Comfortable beds. 

CONS:
- Off the strip.  You'll need a car or a cab to get around.
- The rooms don't seem to cool down based on the temperature setting you select.
- None of the on-site restaurants are that great.
- No late checkout policy unless you want to pay $50.
- You'll easily hear random drunk people in the hallways in the middle of the night.  Likely due to the younger crowd.
- On-site Affliction store quickly allows D-Bags to update their attire.

The Hard Rock falls into the 3 1\/2 stars category, but I'm going with 3 stars primarily because of their refusal to give me a late check out.  Be prepared to be packed and out of there by 11 AM.",1,4,1

I personally prefer to stay on this strip, and this visit confirmed why--cabs lines are long, and cab rides can really add up and make a trip much more costly in the long run.
The HRH tower suites were very nicely appointed, if laid out a little strange. The bathroom was very spacious, but I thought it was strange that a glass wall separates it from the bedroom, with a curtain for privacy. Seems a bit cumbersome in lieu of just a solid wall, or a textured\/matte\/frosted glass wall.
The beds were very comfortable. A lot of noise from the nearby airport as well, but I didn't notice much.
Staff was hit or miss. Housekeeping was prompt and friendly, but asking anyone for directions on the ground\/casino floor was very challenging.
The pool area is nice and well maintained, but very crowded and loud. Go figure since it is considered a ""party pool""--not necessarily bad, just know what to expect.  The pool itself was REALLY cold on a mild weekend in March.
The price wasn't great, so I don't see myself staying here again unless a friend insisted or I got a great deal, but I enjoyed my weekend and wouldn't NOT recommend.

The front desk was trying to charge us the regular rate and said the Rehab entrance fee was about $100-$250 per person.

I'll make this as simple as I can:
1. Hotel is off strip located a few minutes from the airport. Folks say the walk to the strip isnt too bad - I did not make the walk because I would have had to walk alone. Didn't really feel like testing my fate.
2. Room was in the Casino tower - view wasn't fantastic because we had a street view. Had a clear view of the airport and could lay in bed and watch the planes come in and out. I DID NOT HAVE A COFFEE MAKER IN MY ROOM - I had to walk downstairs each morning for coffee. I won't lie, this sucked.
3. My bed was FANTASTIC. All the fantastic things you've heard about the comfort of the bed are correct. I loved the bed. You sink in the bed when you sit down thanks to the featherbed and there's a light down comforter. The bed is amazing ... comfortable ... heavenly ... Fantastic.
4. Our bathroom was not updated - wasn't too big of a deal because I could still take a shower and get clean.
5. Minibar madness in the room .... Mini fridge and a display on the desk full of items for you to purchase. Save your money and walk across the street.
6. Subway, CVS and a liquor store are across the street. There's also a ton of food places in strip mall with CVS. Make the walk over, you'll save a ton of cash.
7. Lots of people complain about the music in the hotel ... you're staying at HARD ROCK. I love music and didn't have any issues with the volume of music or the music playing. I loved the selection of music.
8. Didn't see lots of big winners ... if you're planning on gambling, you might want to make your way over to the strip and spend your money there.
9. Pools - there are different pools - ALL POOLS EXCEPT NIRVANA HAVE A MINIMUM $50 DRINK AND FOOD CHARGE. If you don't want to pay the minimum to sit in the chairs, head over to the Nirvana pool. You're not charged a fee to sit in the chairs at that pool.
10. Restaurants - there are a few different restaurants ... Mr. Lucky, Pink Taco, FU, Culinary Dropout, Nobu and 35 Steaks. I ate at FU, Mr. Lucky and Pink Taco. Nothing spectacular ... standard food and standard overpriced entrees.",2,2,1

I went to HRH in September of 2013 during the weekend of the Mayweather fight so it was bumping' which is good because I just turned 21. I picked this place initially because of the price and the pool. The price was decent for a fight weekend and the pool was pretty nice, very good size with a few pools to choose from. 
The only problem with the pools is the weekend when the security guards are flown in straight from Nazi Germany. My friend was not allowed in to the main pool area because her purse was literally 1cm too big for the rules. We showed the security guy we only had our phones, towels, room keys and a magazine. No dice. The women behind us had the same problem. I proceeded to make the security guard feel like a complete douche bag. I usually don't like to belittle people in public but this was a special case. If I was saying the same thing to an actual cop as I said to this fascist I would have ended up in handcuffs. It wasn't free to get into the main area either, even as hotel guests. So we settled with the quieter more family oriented pool area which was actually a little better than the main area, I think. If they were more friendly I would have given 4 stars, easily. All of the other staff non-pool related were all accommodating.

The rooms were ok, no major complaints but I am not sure who designed the doors to the shower. They clearly didn't attend any architecture classes...

The casino and the food are actually not bad. Pink Taco is pretty good.

 Everyone gambling was wearing Ed Hardy and had Ed Hardy-esque tattoos. I felt a little out of place because I don't have any tattoos with huge bible quotes on my ribcage or some lame poem on my arm. The casino itself has some pretty nice rock memorabilia though!



 There is a free shuttle to the strip before like 6pm or so.

I wouldn't tell anyone not to go, but it is definitely for the more younger crowd, which is fine. I would like to stay at the Aria though next time I go to Vegas. Their casino was 2x as badass as the HRH.",0,0,0

Just arrived to the hotel for a film shoot this weekend in Vegas. Keep in mind, the large corporation I work for books hundreds of rooms here a year for different events and tradeshows. I unloaded the whole car on to a luggage cart and then was told to leave it with the guy and call them when we get to our room. Sorry but I don't feel comfortable leaving close to $500,000 worth of camera gear with some random worker I don't know. I asked if I can go up with the luggage cart and he called his manager out.

The manager walks out, doesn't greet me or even ask for an explanation. He just says, "" if you want to take it yourself, go for it, take it off our cart."" I looked at him, shocked at his attitude to a guest. And he says again, "" well... start unloading it..""

Get everything confirmed with the front desk and do they EVER actually make the wake up call? No. Not one time. In fact, I ONLY hear from them when the manager and security comes beating on my door at 9:30 am, two hours and thirty minutes late from the wake up call, to harass me about payment. Payment that wouldn't be due until.11:30 check out. Payment that wasn't due period because she had charged my credit card, paid in full. You want to talk about irate?? I was fuming. Not only did I miss my flight and have to scatter to find a new one which places me home a day later, I am staying in an airport.

Their NEW Celebrity Suites are BEAUTIFUL! 

Walking in through their double doors, I felt like I was on an episode of Cribs. But instead of being kicked out at the end of the episode, I got to stay and enjoy a night in my own suite. 

Upon entering, you are greeted by a mirrored, marble-floored entry opening into an 800 sq foot parlor with a custom made pool table, dark textured walls, velvet-like curtains and interior design one might expect at an Ian Schrager hotel. Likely because now that the Morgan's Hotel Group owns the Rock, their design influence is much more chic. 

A nice (but not yet completed) wet bar area adjoins the pool table area complete with a well stocked fridge.

To the left of the pool table is the living room, which features a 50+"" Philips flat screen TV, a Wii game console, Bose sound system, and iPod dock with all the adapters. The rooms french doors open up and look out 11 stories over the Hard Rock pool and off in the distance the Strip.

The bedroom is dark and sexy. The bed has an 8' tall leather headboard with 2 crystal lamps on either side of the King size bed. Opposite the headboard of course is another large flatscreen TV.

The master bath is bigger than most studio apts in the city. And yes, there is a flat screen in there too, mounted just off of the 4 person jacuzzi tub. All marble floors and a marble walk-in 8 person shower with rainbath showerheads. And behind a small door sits the throne with your own phone... if you really have to make a call while you're dropping the kids off.

The gal didn't know how to do so she went to get help she was gone for about 20min but came back and adjusted everything no problem. We had reserved a king size bed but there were none upon our checking in at 4pm (check in is 3pm) we could have waited who knows how much longer for a king but we were tired and had dinner reservations. The Paradise Tower was very nice! Although our room key was a bit temperamental in the elevator, everything else was great. They do have ice machines which I had read on here (yelp) they didn't. We found what looked like a dried blood stain on our comforter which was disgusting. But management came up and apologized and re-made the bed. Our alarm clock was set for 5pm luckily it was 5pm not am! The Rehab music wasn't too disrupting, only heard slight bass from our room. Although the pool party brought in a lot of young, intoxicated adults security was everywhere on the hotel floor making sure people kept moving along. The Pink Taco was very good! The deli right across from the pink taco though was unimpressive, the customer service was not good and my wildberry smoothie was based out of orange juice and that's all I could taste. At check out there were only two at the counter and a long line, the employees handled the stress of the growing line well.",0,0,0

First time was Super Bowl weekend and most recent was this past July 4th. Rooms are pretty decent depending on what you get. The standard room wasn't jaw dropping and had some issues with it. During my first visit, we stayed at the one of the rooms in the Paradise tower. The carpet was still wet and I disliked the black toilets and black tile shower walls. I'm blind without my glasses or contacts so when I would take a shower, it was even harder for me to see anything because of the black shower tiles. 

This past 4th of July weekend my husband and I stayed at the Gorilla suite on the 2nd floor at the Paradise towers. The room itself was pretty cool. We had our own little patio right next to Rehab. It would have been great to been able to go in and out by the pool as we pleased, but our gate that separated us from the pool was locked. We were told by the front desk that we would be able to have poolside access from our suite but was later told we couldn't. Since our room was next to Rehab the music would be blasting from 10am - 7pm. I didn't mind as much but your the type of person who needs quite time, then this suite is not for you.",5,1,1

This trip was a spur of the moment trip after ditching the family in Central Cali.I decided to take my Family with me to my fav Vegas hotel. Online reservations are great and easy to use. Late thanksgiving afternoon looked online and made reservations in ten mins. After a 8 hour drive we arrived at the front desk. I am usually very happy with the service and everything but this time there were a few things that bummed me out.

At check-in i mentioned in small talk that i love this place and have been here multiple times this year and really love it. I asked her if she had any Free or Cheep upgrades she could hook me up with.... After saying very nicely ""sure let me check it out"" She came back with ""I can upgrade you to a Pool view room for $40""....... I said....""Hmmm That's not really and upgrade That's an Upsale!"" The pool view really doesn't bring much this time of the year with temp in the 40's. I graciously declined. 

Next i asked  about the pool or jacuzzi's she said they have one pool open and it's heated. Also there are 2 indoor jacuzzi's that are included in the ""$15 Daily Resort Fee"" that is added to the bill. We found out that ""heated Pool"" means the pool isn't frozen and an ice skating rink but it's still completely un-swimable. It was like 65 degrees or something. And the 2 jacuzzi's  that are free as part of the ""resort fee"" are 18 and up only which doesn't really help us with 2 kids..

Lastly i asked who was playing at the Wasted Space (a great little club\/bar in the main casino with bands & live music) this weekend and she said that the Wasted Space club had closed down. :( Boo I understand that these things happen, but it's a bummer.

So all in all My wife and kids had a blast, I had a good time but next trip we are surly going to try somewhere new... Change it up a bit. You can get rooms at the Wynn for the same price range with advance notice. I am headed back to Vegas in Jan and we are staying at the Wynn.

Their service in general is only subpar for such a popular hotel. The reason for the two star knock offs are for their service and $$. I stayed here for my bachelorette party. First, the resort fees are high and a mysterious restaurant bill was tacked on which will have to be disputed. No one ordered room service nor did the card holder use the card to pay for their restaurant meals. Second, darn me for forgetting my white jacket in the white sheets after checking out. We left our luggage in the front as we took the rest of our last day to dine and sight see. I realized upon leaving that I forgot the jacket and called immediately to report it. The response was not very attentive so it was questionable if he even cared. Hours later when we got back, no one looked into it and I had to re-report it to a new person who then checked it and stated it would be hours before I could get an update on it. Wow...and then I thought fine, I won't get all hoity toity about it. So I had to go through the process of the hotel getting back to me on shipment and handling since I would not be there hours later as I would be catching my flight back. 

Well they charged an arm and a leg for a jacket that gets shipped for $6.99 on retail sites. So you know what my rant is about... WHO IS TAKING THESE CALLS AND CHECKING?! Apparently, no one. I'm sure they started panicking when they realized I arrived back at the hotel and no one had looked into it at all. Geez...forget the jacket, how about the horrible service?! 

Third, if you're lucky, you'll receive a good keeper for house cleaning services. Apparently, the other half of my group had a guy who didn't clean or replace toilet paper and towels. On the other side of the room, we had a lady who kept our place neat and tidy. It's a hit or miss. You could have a good time depending what you're there for and what you care about. I wouldn't go back though because I would have to deal with shoddy services again. Yes...someone is twirling in my white Banana Republic jacket.",0,2,1

Visually, it looks exactly how it appears on their website, but things were just off.  The lamp they have that hangs on the wall above their couch was bent. Almost looked like someone tried to swing on it the night before lol. Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas right? But could you fix it before we check in? Oh, let me explain one thing, there were 4 in my group, 2 of us each stayed in the HRH King Suites, and we had adjoining rooms, so in one room, the internal ipod dock and speakers they had within the room worked perfectly, in the other one it didnt work at all. That was a let down, because that's one of the coolest features of this room. Since we were only staying for 2 nights and were able to share the sound system we didn't ask to switch rooms or complain about it at all.  Last downside would be in my cousins room their toilet was pre clogged. Plus sides? They came up right away when we called them with this issue and fixed it immediately.

The two-story room was beautiful, spacious and overlooked the outdoor pool. It was too cold to go outside for any prolonged length of time so I couldn't make use of the pool or my private cabana. Maybe next time. 

I invited some friends over and the downstairs was perfect for entertaining. I couldn't figure out how to work the room's sound system but there were two large screen televisions, one downstairs and the other in the bedroom. I was a good host, but also kept one eye glued to the television so I could watch the Iowa primary election results.

At 6'3 I'm something of a big guy and find it hard to get comfortable in most standard size bathtubs; it's difficult to enjoy a good soak when your legs are dangling over the rim. The tub in the upstairs bathroom was perfect for someone of my size. It was the best bath of my life.

I had a great night's sleep on the king sized bed, adorned with a goose down comforter and feather pillows. The minibar featured all of my favorite liquors, energy drinks, and assorted snacks.

Hard Rock use to be a cool Casino where all the hot young people would flock to, in order to have some fun.  Being a loyal Hard Rock faithful for the last 7 years I can now honestly say this place went down hill big time. I started to notice it last year but continued to stay there in hopes it would turn around.  I can honestly say I will NEVER stay there or party there ever again. Their hotel just sucks. The hotel is filthy dirty, the staff is RUDE, the pool is an STD waiting to happen and the staff is ugly, old and auffle!
     One of the reasons I use to frequent this casino was because I knew everyone who worked there. Everyone use to be so friendly and nice, boy has this place gone down. Why would you ever go to Hard Rock, Rehab or any of there ghetto Jerseyfied clubs when you can stay somewhere nice like Cosmopolitan or Encore. Not to mention those 2 hotels have fabulous and classy pool parties. At Hard Rock you can find all the overweight rejects who just want to get black out drunk and cause problems at their pool or nightclub. After taking a huge step back and finally deciding to venture out of my little Hard Rock bubble I realized that I waisted my time in a shit hole over the last 7 years. Mark my words I will never return. Too bad that me and all my hot girl friends won't be going back there,  looks like the pool will be even uglier now! 
DO NOT STAY AT THIS DIRTY, RAUNCHY, DINGY HOTEL! Oh, and to the new management staff at the Pool you all suck and are rude! Especially ""the Asian guy who claims he's the pool manager"" and ""Mike"" the VIP Host who is not so VIP.  I miss the days when AMG ran the pool.",2,2,0

Couldn't get early check in so left our bags & headed out. One nice bonus is that they will call you as soon as ur room is ready.

Got a room facing the parking structure in paradise tower but could still see the strip so not so bad for the low price that we paid.

On Sunday saw the line for Rehab and headed to the free HRH tower pool we thought was perfect without the overpriced cover and line of D-bags and strippers outside. 

I loved the pool here still had a great DJ, pool had a side with sand and the other side was just regular pool. Sand felt nice on tired feet. 

Bar was close and service there is great since its low key but you can still see all the action from rehab and the people keep the party going here so we had a blast dancing and drinking. 

For not paying a cover and getting a great daybed poolside i would def. go back to the pool here but get a hotel closer to the strip.

Hate places that won't even let you touch items in the fridge without being charged, so tacky.

Shuttle to the strip ends at  5pm, really?.

Went in July and half the pools are shut down, what gives? That was the whole reason I picked the hotel.  They also closed most of the pool at 6pm for some reason. They don't give any break on the ""resort"" fee though. 

 Oh, and the toilet ran non-stop.and the door wouldn't shut on it's own you had to slam it.

Also the whole having to use your key card to use the elevator is bogus. Anybody can jump on the elevator who isn't staying there if  they follow someone. There is a false sense of security.

It isn't just because they have the hottest, loosest and craziest women on the strip (although that really helps) but because the vibe is so chill and unpretentious. It all revolves around the circle bar which is a great place to hang out at any hour but especially on the weekend nights when is at its craziest. And what can I say about the  music? They always have some great classic rock tunes bursting out so it is a great party scene. And of course, when talking about the HRH one can't forget to mention Rehab which still is the best pool party in Vegas (despite the fact that there are a lot of meathead tools lurking around).

To get to the Paradise, umm, take a right at Quadrophenia\/Pink Taco, past John Varvatos and Affliction, past the Starbucks that isn't an ""official"" Starbucks but has the sweetest Baristas ever, past the convenience store where you should stock up on Vitamin Water XXX and Advil (They also have single bottles of microbrews, tweezers, and anything else your hard rock stay might call for), once you pass the B\/W photos of the Rolling Stones at their freakin' peak in the '70's, you'll see a huge mural of a forgotten Elton John album nobody but the editors of Rolling Stone care about. Take a left there at the album that is not Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.

Phew. Wait, you're not done. Keep walking past the doors to the Hard Rock's most awesome pools, 3-4 separate pools, two with natural sand floors, one elevated private pool with windows on the bottom that overlook a bar, all stocked with hotties that probably make Sundays Rehab-x THE place to be in Vegas. Walk past the deli on your right that is good for Illy coffee and crepes in the morning, then at the oversized photos of classic rock albums such as Peter Gabriel (I), an original print of Dark Side of the Moon, take a right.

Yes, the Paradise Tower is THAT freakin' far from the front desk! At least during that walk and your stay, they are constantly cranking the rock and roll through the intercom. You are never far from the rock, here.

The road is long, but the rooms are awesome. The most comfortable King sized bed on the planet awaits you. A huge plasma screen TV, a fridge stocked with alcohol and more Vitamin Water (probably 3x as much as the convenience store), glass-mirrored table tops, charcoal colored decor touches everywhere, a bathroom light that is programmed to SLOWLY turn on so as to not shock your hangover...that was hilarious! It's so slow! And for $69 on a weekday plus a small resort fee...you've got the best kept secret off of the Strip.

No matter what you do, do not eat at Pink Taco during peak drunk times. I once almost dumped an ice cream sundae over some douchebag's head there. All in the name of valor. The food is not worth the drunks. DO, however, eat at Nobu and the nice but casual Italian LTO (formerly AGO).

The HRH Casino isn't that great. But the atmosphere is. The Hard Rock trends towards a younger crowd than most of Vegas, and for that, it's worth a visit even if you're staying on the Strip. The Strip is a short cab ride away, and staying at the Hard Rock is really worth it. You're worth it!",9,7,7

Shannon in reservations helped me switch my reservation since my friend Ms. Trout couldn't show up due to a family tragedy- it only took 6 hours on the phone  ( literally) and everyone passing me around to get it done but I'm pleased with the service. Just clean your rooms better please

My new husband and I stayed in their tower suites for our honeymoon and we loved it from start to finish. The gentleman who checked us in to our hotel at the Tower Check-in desk was super professional (without being TOO robotic) and friendly and made check in really easy. 

The Queen SUITES. HUGE for just a standard suite. Two Flat screen TV's, a HUGE bathtub (which hell yes I did), Down comforters on both beds -- REALLY COMFORTABLE. The Elevators from the Parking Garage are right near the Tower check in. 

The only little tiny gripe I had was the music playing system in our room. Not even a big deal -- it still played music and had an iPOD dock and we really didn't use it much so big whoop. 

We decided this was going to be our go-to place for our Vegas trips from now on! 

We booked our three night stay for $275 through BOOKIT.COM (HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING ON THIS SITE AND BOOKING DURING THEIR SALES) 

We ordered room service and the gentleman bringing up the food was awesome and super friendly. Totally worth it. 

The casino floor is nice and clean and smoke-free. Music blasting because, hello, you're at the Hard Rock, and they had a real nice display of memorabilia. 

I RARELY give out Five star reviews for anything. This place in my opinion definitely deserved it. Cool, relaxing Vegas experience.",6,0,3

I travel for a living and have stayed in hundreds of hotels because of work and by far this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.  My wife and I came to Vegas for a fun time so we decided to stay here.  First of all we felt like we were staying at the ""Jersey Shores"".  If that is your crowd then you will really like it a lot.  When we checked in they said they upgraded us to the Paradise Tower with a pool view.  We asked for a mountainside view when we made reservations but were told that it wouldn't be too loud and were assured that we would really like the poolside view upgrade. BAD idea!!!! When we got to our room the music from the pool was going and all the speakers face the Paradise Tower and because it's so loud it literally vibrates the windows.   Honestly plan on never sleeping if you get a poolside view room.  As a heads up the décor in the Paradise Tower is so dark the rooms are dark and it shows dirt really easily.   We had so many problems that we called guest services from the hotel phone.  We let the phone ring for 30 minutes for someone to answer.  When they finally did they sounded annoyed.  We asked if they had any other rooms but they said they were full and wouldn't allow us to change rooms.  That didn't seem right so after I hung up I called the reservation desk from my cell phone.  When I did they said they had plenty of rooms in the hotel and I could get a room without a poolside view.  So I called back and again no one answered or picked up for 15 minutes.  I ended up calling the main number on the website and they picked up right away.  So if you ever stay here NEVER call the guest service number from your hotel room but call the number on the website with your cell phone and they will pick right up.
After two days of not sleeping because from the music from the pool and the music from the pool area from the concert at the pool at night plus the guests next to us who brought their own sound system and blasted music all night we had enough and demanded a room change.  When we asked they said they were full but I told them we had just called reservation and were told they had plenty of rooms they finally admitted they had rooms and they moved us.  We ended up getting moved to the HRH tower and what a difference.  The rooms are bright, big and the windows don't vibrate all day from music.  IF you want a quiet peaceful room the HRH tower is it.  It is more expensive but SO worth it.     
As for the pool because the pool has limited pool chairs I had to go down at 8 am every morning and put towels down on chairs to save them because if not it fills up fast and you won't get a lounge chairs.  If you want to pay for poolside bed or cabana that is another option but for the free lounge chairs get down early and save your chairs in advance.  
As far as the service from the staff something is coming from management because I have never been this badly treated.   I get treated better from the DMV then from people that work at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Overall I give this place a 0 but the lowest score I could score it was a 1.  We will never stay here again and in talking with a lot of other guests they feel the same way.",5,2,2

You have to be a guest at the hotel to get into the pool area if not you have to pay for admissions.

Overall I really enjoyed my stay and wouldn't mind rooming here again. Upon entering, we were greeted with blaring rock music, dim lights and strewn around the hotel were glass cases of famous outfits worn by famous artists like Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson. We stayed in the old Casino Tower on the 10th floor. 

First, the rooms were nothing like I imagined as I was so used to the generic bad-carpet-design-with-dim-lighting-and-scratchy-uncomfy-beds sort of hotel rooms. I was surprised that the room itself was spacious and that ""there's so much more room for activities!"" (Stepbrothers) The room had two framed photographs of the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, which were a nice touch, pretty musical-note carpet, and a nice black headboard against the wall where the bed is. The room included a huge flat-screen tv, black-out curtains as well as a door that opened so that fresh air could get in and out. The bathroom was small but nice. However, our shower dial thing immediately popped off when I tried showering the first night. Our bed was super soft, and although I prefer firm beds, I slept like a lil' babby in it. 

Second, I wished that this hotel was located directly on the strip because it was so hard to get things to and from each place. Each day we had to think about what we needed before proceeding to exit the hotel just so we didn't have to come back in the middle of the day (which did happen multiple times). There IS a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the Fashion Show Mall at the end of the strip BUT it stops at 5 PM. That's unfortunate for those night owls who are partying away on the strip. 

Third, the hotel charges a resort fee per day for their pool area, gym, Internet, and other utilities. It was kinda lame because we didn't use any of these except for the Internet. NOTE!!: The hotel charges an extra $14 or so per device per room. So if you're on the Internet on your iPad, you can't also have your laptop on the Internet unless you want to be charged this extra fee. 

Fourth, the hotel gave us vouchers for a free bottle of selected liquor as well as like 15% off stuff at their store. We took advantage of the free alcohol and partied by ourselves while watching the Travel channel (party hard! HAHA). 

Fifth, there IS a dress code applied after 8PM wherein the bf said was when ""the sluts come out."" It wasn't clear what dress code meant (slutty? PJ party? costumes?) so I did walk out in sweats once or twice. I kinda got the feeling that the Hard Rock Hotel is mainly for those tanned-to-a-crisp-douchebag-wears-sunglasses-indoors-with-iced-tips-and-pink-polos-trashy-listens-to-Nickelback-and-worships-Meatloaf type of people. :x I am not one of them.

When we arrive to valet the car, we were standing there for a good 5 minutes and no one was approaching up. When the bell boy comes to get our luggage, it looks like we're inconveniencing him. The arriving process took about 15 minutes, oh and we were the only ones there. 

When we go inside, we order a drink at the bar. Bartender is rude.

Finally, we get into our room. Nice room, but floors feel damp and there's absolutely no toilet paper. It took housekeeping about an hour to bring it up after we requested it. 

Next day, my cousin rented a  cabana at their amazing pool (it truly is). Our waitress was nice and friendly, but the service was soooo SLOW. I mean, every time we ordered something, it took 45min to an hour to come out. Pretty ridiculous since we're spending so much money on the cabana.

Rich and artificially bad-boy, it has a built-in audience of wanna-be rockers and groupies.  This makes for some of the best people watching in Vegas.

As for the actual facilities: Dimly lit and relatively low-density, the public areas at ground level convey a Hollywood sense of a Casino resort.  If you enter on a busy evening while a favorite song begins on the sound system, there's a palpable sense of briefly living inside a movie.   With the right combination of moment and song, it can offset any other negative about the place.

Their rooms aren't bad for the price. They're not as large or as good (and some floors still need refurbishing) as the newer destinations, but they're not a rip off, either.  The lower-level views are uninspiring, but that's nothing particular to his hotel. 

Its location is a mixed bag.  The area around it on Paradise has improved over the years, but it's still a long way to get to other attractions of equal or greater caliber. 

For drinking or hanging out, it's a good spot.  The bars have a good amount of space (and higher prices) though the clubs can be thick with attitude (hardly a unique signifier in LV).

For gambling, it's probably not worth it unless you're a whale.  Bet minimums are strip-average or higher, which at least keeps the Casino from overcrowding even on peak nights.   

The restaurants are ok to good, with only Nobu pushing the quality envelope.

Been regulars here since the week they opened. We just recently gave it up for the Palms.
Gone is the boutique rocker atmosphere since the expansion. 

We tip $5 per comp drink and it'll bring the waitress back with a $20 drink. Tip any less and you'll never see her again.

Beware!:
In addition to the 7% sales tax, the $9 on line booking fee, then the 11% room tax, the Hard Rock hits you with an additional $28 per day resort fee + $28 additional if a band is playing at the pool + the cost of your room on top all that !!

$100 check out fee if you forget to check out! No hit & run convenient key drop, you go back in line and check out or you'll see another $100.00 on your CC.
The fees are not included in the room rate, they tack them on at check-in, you can not opt-out any of them. 

The Hard Rock Hotel recently survived another difficult bankruptcy, and once again re-sold and rising from their financial ashes on your dime. Thus:

Beware of their 6:5 blackjack trap, something to avoid. No 21 player with any brains plays that rate. It's at all their tables.

The video poker and slots are NOW a near impossible to win 26% house rake\/advantage. So if you're getting your ass thoroughly kicked at a 2% advantage dice \/ blackjack table,, imagine your chances at a 26% advantage machine!

Staggering odds emerge. It's why you won't meet any locals or employees or sharp gamblers gaming here. You will not win.

Do not leave anything of value in your room. You will be ripped off.

Beware of the check-in desk gratuity scam:
The desk clerk will act as if they are up-grading your room for no additional cost, but in fact isn't.
Guests fall for this scam thus tip them fat, only to find they still have a standard room.

They have it all figured out: Anyone dumb enough to pay $450.00 for a fifth of Goose, is dumb enough to fall for the tight casino odds and rules and employee tip scams.",10,0,0

It's not a terrible hotel, especially for a hotel that was originally conceived as a concert venue with some rooms, rather than a full-fledged resort. I've only stayed in the Paradise tower, where the rooms are nice, but nothing special. The overall decor theme (which was originally leopard print and purple) of grays and reds just feels dingy and dirty. I get that they're trying to channel a nightclub\/rock lounge feel, but it gets old rather quickly. 

I find much of the clientele to be classless. The young, party-seeking crowd that the hotel and several of its venues (Rehab, Body English) attract seem to care less about little things like manners, decorum, and hygiene. Should you think that I'm an old fart with a bias against 20-somethings (Full disclosure: I'm 39), let me assure you that I'd be equally annoyed by bands of 50-year olds walking through the hallways shouting obscenities, starting drunken brawls and doing things like leaving a 40-foot trail of puke in their wake because they chose to vomit and walk and vomit and walk rather than stay outside and hurl in the bushes. 

Which leads me to the cleaning staff. While there are a few a exceptions, I find the crew at the Hard Rock completely inept. Whether this is due to poor training, understaffing or horrible management, I cannot tell. 

Exhibit A: The aforementioned 40-foot trail of vomit took nearly an hour to be cleaned up. That was after the twenty minutes it took for a staff person to say, ""we should probably get this cleaned up.""

Exhibit B: I stopped by my room at lunchtime on a Sunday, and noticed a discarded room service plate of chicken wings that my next-door neighbor had placed outside their door. They had obviously been in quite a rush, because wings were strewn across the hallway in front of their door. When I went to bed that night...the plate was still there. When I got up the next morning...it was STILL there. The last sighting was sometime after 10am Monday, probably an hour or so after some staff person saw it and thought, ""we should probably get this cleaned up.""

Exhibit C: My room got passed over for cleaning one day. When I called down for service, three maids appeared to service the room (well done!). They made the bed, refreshed the towels...and then left the room with all of the trash and dirty glasses untouched. Oh well. One coworker performed an experiment by leaving her Do Not Disturb sign on the floor a few feet inside her room. It stayed there for 4 days. 

The Hard Rock does have a few redeeming qualities: Culinary Dropout and 35 Steaks, comfortable beds, and bars that serve well-poured drinks for decent prices. The convention staff was helpful and fun to work with. And Pilot, the super-helpful security guy that went out if his way to make my friends feel welcome and cared for on a handful of occasions.

I will probably end up staying at the hotel again for work, but I definitely won't choose it for a personal stay -- that is, until new management comes in and decides, ""we should probably get this cleaned up.",11,7,0

Pros.
Nice clean hotel and rooms
Amazing all ages sand pool
Awesome Rock memorabilia
Fast Check In

Cons.
We booked this hotel specifically to give our kids some exposure to live music. We stayed on a Thursday night, only to find that there was NO live music. We saw great live music on Wednesday at New York New York. We saw a good band that Thursday at Planet Hollywood - but the Hard Rock - Nada !

Yes, we got a cheap rate on-line, but when the hotel is obviously no where near full, you would hope that you might get a half decent view. Nope, second floor looking straight into a brick wall. It's no wonder the place isn't full, they don't do much to encourage you to come back.

Next- while the sand pool was amazing, there is NO SHADED AREAS to lounge in unless you pay a high price for a cabana. The only shaded area was the bar area, but you had to be 21+ to be in there - so there was no shade foe the kids. To me this is a health issue that holds a lot of weight to where I will stay with my kids.

Bottom line - it's a nice hotel that let's itself down is some key areas.",0,0,0

We found a groupon for two nights at the Hard Rock for $160. That seemed like a good deal, so we went for it. When we tried to use it to book the same night, we were told that the person who could book the groupon deals was gone, and when i called first thing the next morning, i was told most nights had already been booked up. The earliest available night was Christmas. That was a little later then i had been planning, but worked out alright for us anyway. Then we are told that only two queen bed rooms are available, oh and we get to pay $20 extra bucks a night for the privilege. I was a little pissed.

This all made me kind of regret my choice, but we were locked in. When we arrive on Christmas, the self-parking was rather confusing, but we finally arrive at check-in. The lobby was very nice, and the guy checking us in was very helpful. I happened to mention we really wanted a king bed room, and he found one for us! Very happy about that. We also got a bunch of vouchers with our deal, 4 free drinks, $40 to spend at one of three of their restaurants. 

The room was gorgeous. The bathroom was fabulous. Separate toilet room, then a huge glass enclosed shower area. Beautiful marble (or fake marble) double sink. The bed was soo comfy, especially we had stayed in hotels with crappy beds on our drive down to Vegas. Down everywhere. Very cool looking room.

The gambling area (after seeing the places on the strip), was a little underwhelming and small. Drinks were fine. We ordered room service once, which we thought was reasonably priced, and very tasty. Also went to Pink Taco, which I wasn't exactly thrilled with. I think they could do with a bit more variety of restaurants. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but would spend my time on the strip and at other places for eating, entertainment, and gambling.",4,1,3

Came here with the wife to celebrate my birthday. My 31st to be exact.Hey 31 is the new 21! Ok, getitng off topic. Back to the review.

As soon as we enter the hotel, we were definitely loving the decor and rock and roll memorobilia that is all over the walls, in protective cases. Items from all the legendary bands and artists. From Guns and roses, Santana, Michael Jackson and a lot more.

The front desk ladies checking us in were very quick and friendly.The casino floor never seemed or smelled too smokey our whole stay there. Which is a good thing of course.

Our room was simple. The carpet and decor seems a little outdated. But no deal breaker. It does have a 42 inch flatscreen, so that was nice. The beds were freaking amazing!! I literally fell asleep upon my head hitting the pillow. We were on the 4th floor right above the pool area. Of course there was nobody ever in the pool. It is January and 25 degrees. Despite the outdated feel to the room, it was very well maintained and clean. 

We got the rooms for $42 a night which is the biggest reason we stayed there. Were not cheap, we just wanted to have more eating, drinking, and gambling money available.

Overall, I would be happy staying here again on our next trip out to Vegas.",2,1,1

Pros:   The hotel is very modern and stylish. The room was excellent and the elevators were fast. It was not noisy around my room. Parking was very good, although I did NOT have to deal with a Saturday night concert crowd because Sheryl Crow canceled that night. 

Cons:   There was a $16.80 ""resort fee"" per night which kind of sucks. Also, it's not within walking distance of the strip.

Self-parking was much easier than I expected, considering we were coming to a show on a Saturday night, and the walk from self-parking to the interior of the casino was not bad at all.

While we probably should have done Pink Taco before the show, we decided to hit the Race and Sports Book to have pre-show drinks and watch the second half of the Notre Dame-Florida State football game.

While the sports book seating area is rather small and looks more like Mission Control in Houston for a NASA-themed movie, the bar to the side had two extremely cool and attractive ladies working hard for us. Sheila may have been the best looking woman I saw in Vegas the entire weekend and the gorgeous Lindy said if I dumped my friend she would have joined me for the concert. (It was considered...but he has been a friend for too long)

Oh, and if a tremendous football game (THERE WAS NO PASS INTERFERENCE) combined with beautiful ladies wasn't enough...factor in awesome drink specials. We had our choice of ANY draft for $3 or any Bacardi or Grey Goose cocktail for $6. (Seriously, this is the Hard Rock? No wonder my Griddle Cafe visit from later that night is a bit sketchy)

I stayed at the Stratosphere the first time and Imperial Palace the second. BOTH times i had fun and enjoyed my stay. As soon as we tried to check into the Hard Rock we experienced ""computer problems"". We waited for around an  HOUR before we could check in. Once we did check in, they informed us that because of the computer issues only ONE of the three rooms we booked were ready. WTF?? So we went to the only room that was available and waited around for yet another hour for OUR room to be ready. When we finally got our key, we discover that we had a room with two beds instead of one. So naturally, we were already pretty damn upset. It was 5pm! So we went downstairs to try and get some sort of compensation. The staff was very rude and only gave us 20 off of our resort fees. The only plus about this hotel are the rooms and the beds. Other than that, it's a ways off the strip, the casino itself is ok, and the club in there sucked. We were vip guests with a group of attractive ladies and still couldn't get in.

Our King Room in the Casino Tower faced the pool, and it was a decent view with a pseudo balcony, where the windows open but you can't step out.  It was in the middle of December so no one was swimming, and it was damn cold.  I'm guessing its a bit more active when its summer time.

The rooms were spacious and I really liked the lotion they gave.  Smells good.  Too bad they use soap and not shower gel.  Oh well.

Upon checking in, the front desk clerk was super friendly.  First thing she told me was she loved my hair, that I had perfect curls (no complaints there).  She then upgraded us to a room in the Paradise tower without us asking.  She let us know it was their most recently remodeled tower.  She was also super helpful with info about restaurants and the free shuttle to the strip.  

The room itself was quite nice.  It was on a higher floor, very modern, clean, and had a huge window.  Yes, we were directly overlooking the parking garage, but the larger view was the Vegas strip, absolutely beautiful at night.  The armoire cabinet was a bit scratched up, could use a touch up.  But overall, everything was very clean and our bed was very comfortable.  Yes, the lighting could be better.  It was a bit confusing, and took us some playing around with the switches to figure out which switch worked for which lamp.  I also had to do my makeup by the window, because the lighting in the bathroom was practically non-existent.  The hotel could benefit from investing in brighter bulbs... 

During the day on the weekends, the lobby was bustling with very attractive people, many half-clothed headed to rehab pool.  We were there toward the end of the season, so the lobby wasn't obnoxiously crowded.  

Liked their Lucky's 24 hour cafe.  We stopped there one evening around 2:00 am to grab a late night snack.  The food was decent, the service great, and people watching insane (saw several drunken fools, was impressed with the patience of the servers in dealing with the ridiculousness).  

On our last evening, we decided to gamble at the hotel so we could head up to the hotel room when we got tired.  The casino itself was tiny, and there was only one cocktail waitress that was impossible to order drinks from.  Eventually we headed to the circular bar in the main casino to grab drinks.  This too, made for some amazing people watching.  Between watching several ""working girls"" do their thing, and some old fool literally drunkenly fall of his bar stool, there was plenty of entertainment.  

Our bartender was great.  A funny guy with glasses, he was attentive, and allowed me to taste one of the wines before ordering (they don't have a wine list, have a limited selection of wines at the that bar).  The wine was decent.  I later ordered a Patron Espresso, which they didn't have, but the manager overheard me ordering it and offered to check their other bar to see if they carried it.  He took a while to come back (probably distracted with whatever shenanigans were going on), so I ordered a second glass of wine.  He eventually did show up with the Patron, and offered me the drink for free.  Sweet.  They did have one bartender who was kind of a jerk, practically threw the matches at me when I asked for some.  But thankfully, the other bartender was great and we were able to order mostly from him.  

I could see how this place might not be for everyone.  I saw a girl puking her guts out by the taxis.  On one evening, the elevator we took smelled like vomit and had a suspicious looking stain on the floor.  We arrived back at our hotel around 2:30 am and the casino was packed to the brim. This is not a family friendly hotel, but frankly, I don't think Vegas is all that family friendly to begin with.  (With all the sex and debauchery flying around, I would never bring my kids here if I had any...)

Disappointed that the Pink Taco only has happy hour on particular days of the week.  We love the Pink Taco in LA, and were looking forward to grabbing some appetizers before heading out for the evening  Also, the ventilation in the rooms isn't always great.  Some idiot decided to smoke outside our room, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, and our entire room reeked of smoke for a while.  The shuttle only rides once an hour and until 5PM, and the max passenger seating is 20 ppl.  So, unless you want to cab it everywhere, I do suggest you rent a car.  

But, all in all, we loved it here.  The scene was great, we felt we fit right in.  I'll def be back.",2,2,0

Room was advertised as having a wet bar and dining table for two. Neither exist.

We are very satisfied with the remedy and for that attention to your customers, we give you 5 stars.",4,1,1

I would've definitely been hesitant if I had . I've stayed at Hard Rock in Palm Springs and it's beautiful so I figured the one in Vegas would be too. I planned on going with some friends for my birthday which is St. Patrick's day weekend. It's also march madness which I wasn't aware of at the time. So basically everything is sold out. So I had very slim choices in nice hotels so I figured Hard Rock wouldn't be bad.  

I spoke with a really nice rep that booked my rooms for me. Since it was my birthday she gave me a discount. Instead of charging me $204 a night she charges me $160 a night . She told me the money had to be available the day of because it would come out that day, which was last Tuesday . I said, ""no problem"" I have the money in my account. When Friday rolls around I realize the money had never been taken out of my account. I call Hard Rock and ask when will the money be taken out . I'm not trying to spend money that I'm not supposed to so 3 days have passed can you take the money out for my account now. The rep responds, ""that's weird I thought we took it already. Don't worry about it though, because your reservation is active "" I was like ummm okay, that's weird. It's active yet my money is still in my account 3 days after I booked it.

So something comes up with our plans to go on this Vegas trip . I call to cancel it on Sunday . On Sunday I realized the money still hasn't been removed from my bank account. They cancel it with no problem and send me a cancelation email . I mention to the rep, ""you guys never took my money out""  he said,"" I believe we did"". Umm no buddy I'm looking at my bank account and the same amount is in there. He said well either way your room is canceled so all is well. 

Today on Tuesday a whole full week after I originally booked the rooms and 2 days after I canceled, what comes out of my account ??!! Not $320 for the two night stay but $371.00 . Where did the extra $51 charge come from ??!! I have no idea ! Why is the original $320 coming out a whole week later after I originally made the reservation and then 2 days after I canceled the room ?? I have no idea but this place is a piece of shit and super unorganized ! I didn't even have to stay here in order to realize how unprofessional and unorganized they are. 

I then call HardRock 2 hours ago to speak to billing I was told billing is closed so can I speak to reservations, Fine! I ask them why are they just now taking money out of my account and an extra $51 on top of the original amount ? Where the hell did the extra fees come from ? The rep sounds all dumbfounded. She responds,""not sure what to tell you, your money should've come out when you originally made the reservation a week ago."" REALLY ?? No SHIT Sherlock! She then responds, ""Not sure what extra fees they charged you. Actually I'm not too knowledgeable about billing . I'm just as confused as you are. Can you call back in the morning and speak to billing ?"" 

I just hung up in her face . NO! I can't call back in the morning . I want my money back NOW!! I'm not playing a cat and mouse game with them. No one seems to have any information anytime I call them then they have the nerves to randomly charge my account a whole week later and take extra money too. And there's no explanation. I just called my bank and filed a dispute and they will handle it . I don't plan to stay at this hotel in the future .",6,0,0

One big plus: the front desk people we dealt with through the entire trip were wonderful! Super helpful and friendly, great job there. 

When we walked into our room (on the third floor with a lovely view of the parking lot) it was pretty nice looking and decently sized for the price. The first big issue we ran into was the AC; after about an hour with it cranked up as high as it could go, it was still hot. Mind you, this is August in Vegas with outside temps over 110, so a good AC is a necessity, not a luxury. We called to have it serviced and the guy came up and removed some fan and cleaned it and said it would work, well, it didn't. The guy said it was motion activated, so when we went to sleep, the room turned into a sauna. Our friends in the room next door had the same issue, so I think this is just a crappy old building. Also, the only fridge they had was for the mini-bar, which I think is a little ridiculous. 

Next issue was the hot water, or lack thereof. You had to leave the shower on for 10 minutes just to get warm enough to step into! Also, on several occasions our key cards mysteriously stopped working and we had to walk down to the front desk to get new ones.",3,0,1

We were comp'ed six wrist bands for Rehab and received $100 off our first nights stay and told to call in the morning for a room change. The next morning I was told that our room would not be available for the rest of the weekend but we could take a 700sqft suite with one king bed... because we had four people staying in the room we opted to stay in the smaller suite but because we had booked the larger suite we were told that no matter which room we took we would still have to pay for the 700sqft suite for the remaining two nights... we were appalled!!! After a long conversation we decided to take the larger suite and resorted to sleeping on floors and couches because the hard rock does not have pull out couches and never sent the roll away to our room even after repeated requests...

On the up side the rooms were AMAZING and the pool was gorgeous but our stay was ruined by the lack of service...

Add this to the fact that all during x-mas week, the hotel was empty.
Love the fact they only play x-mas music on dec 25 and no other days.
Love that the hotel isn't so big.
Disappointed there are no frig in room.
Don't mind that its not on the strip....I enjoy walking the 30 minutes to the strip.
Hotel seems like its not the in place anymore.
Biggest complaint is the shuttle to the Strip:
It only goes to the fashion mall.
Why not just go up the street and drop off at planet hollywood or something?
Shuttle runs on the hour but it only takes 15 minutes to get to the mall.
Rest of the time it sits in the HRH garage.   If it ran more often and went to more places, I could cut down on cabs (Cabs from HRH to strip are about $20)

I was trying to explain to them that she was just trying to sober up. They would not negotiate with us. I wasn't arguing I was just trying to explain in the nicest way possible. I was just trying to get us to stay with our group. Then three more came and started grabbing me. And decided to take us both out of the show.

I have bruises all over my body. My sister and I are very disappointed with this treatment. We were born and raised in Vegas and have never witnessed customer service like this.

She wasn't acting out of control, literally just sitting on the couch closing her eyes.. this is disgusting to me.

Waiting in line at the front desk was a nightmare. The staff acted like they were doormen at a club, as if I hadn't paid money to stay there. One staff member told me check-in was from 3pm-4pm. When I went to pick up my room key at 4pm, another staff member told me check-in wasn't until 5pm. I was told, ""I know it will make you feel better to know when you are going to get your room, but we just don't guarantee a check-in time. There's just no way of knowing."" And then she laughed at me and made no eye contact. The hotel is aware they aren't even located on the strip, right? Does the staff know that they aren't the rock stars that are featured in the hotel?

My friend and I who got the rooms were able to check in earlier than expected and the girl even got us rooms right next to each other. Anyways, going to our rooms (paradise tower) was so freakin' far from the entrance. My friends and I were wondering how the heck were we gonna go all the way to our rooms when we're drunk haha. Anyways, the room was really nice. The only problem I had with it was the lighting especially in the bathroom. I felt like I was showering in a cave cause everything was black and the lights were dimmed. My girlfriend and I were fighting over the lamp just so we can do our makeup since the other girls were using the bathroom already. Also, my friends were wondering what kind of comforter they were using because it was really comfy but then again, it was so heavy lol. 

The have two casinos. There's one located in the middle and there's another one in a separate room which is way bigger. Thank god for that $50 casino voucher and 4 complimentary drinks that was included with my Groupon ;) They have a Starbucks, lingerie shop, a tattoo parlor and a couple of restaurants inside which was cool. Another cool thing is that you can check out from your room instead of going all the way to the front to do that. I really didn't understand why some folks decided to just go all the way to the front just to do that. They seriously just wasted their time. A couple of my friends and I still had some time to kill before our flight. Luckily Hard Rock can hold your bag cause we were seriously not gonna go around the strip with our luggage. 

The cab rides from Hard Rock to go to the strip wasn't even that bad especially with 5 people. I didn't like the fact their shuttle which I thought was like a party bus at first. It was actually a 8 seater Cadallic or whatever. Too bad they only allow 6 people though and it was every 15-30 minutes. There's always long lines for the shuttle too so try and go early as possible.

Two queen beds were very comfy and I saw that they do change the down comforters daily. The pools were closed (until April?) with the exception of the small relax pool which was crowded on Saturday afternoon.  Weather was exceptional for late February, and there were only about 4 kids in the pool. The age group was early 20's to 50, so it was comfortable for us.

I wanted to mention that Hank in Security did an excellent job that afternoon when I asked him to calm this drunk foul-mouthed fool who was upset that the bar wasn't open. I discreetly asked Hank to hang out a bit because he was on the verge of becoming obnoxious. *thank you Hank*

We enjoyed the AYCE tapas at Johnny Small's, but the sign is misleading when it advertises that sushi is included. (an old sign, apparently) but we enjoyed the lettuce cups with shrimp, and we ordered two of the tender short ribs.
