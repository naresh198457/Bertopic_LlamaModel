We stopped here after hearing nothing but amazing things and were already there checking out the Miracle Mile shops. The line was a little long but worth the wait! I honestly don't think this place is ever dead because it's open 24 hours and has great food!

I ordered the ""all american"" sandwich and the tomato bisque soup. My boyfriend ordered the chicken chipotle sandwich, which apparently is a limited time only sandwich. Priced fairly well for Vegas (around $6 a sandwich) and we both referred to the size of the sandwiches being like a brick. Both of us loved the portion and freshness of the sandwich, made to order, and I loved my soup! The soup has homemade croutons inside and the sandwich had all my favorites (turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese) and also cranberries! It added a sweetness to the sandwich but very good toasted with the other ingredients. My boyfriend's sandwich was also good, the chipotle sauce giving the chicken a nice flavor. 

I'm a little sad I won't be able to find one of these back home in AZ but am hopeful for the day it makes it here! Definitely check this place out when you're hungry and in Vegas baby!",1,0,0

It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1\/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).",8,5,6

I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional ""bite"". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading. 

It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day.

I go to Vegas by myself quite often to play poker for a weekend.

The first night upon arrival, I was staying at the cosmopolitan and searching for an affordable and quick meal, it dawned on me that my choices at that hour were nothing but high end sit down places.  I realized that I did not want to eat at some fine dinning sit down place by myself so I went on a mission to find some good quality quick food.

 I went from the lobby of the cosmopolitan through the ""crystal"" mall. 

Found nothing.

Then I proceeded to trek it ( and it was a decent walk whilst starving) over to ceases forum. Thinking that something might be open.

Found nothing again...

Remind you, I am alone and have no need for a sit down restaraunt.

Finally, hunger pangs fully kicking, I go over to planet hollywoods mall and walk through the ENTIRE place till I hit an Oasis...

The Hawaiian BBQ (Grilled chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple & BBQ sauce) is a sweet, tangy, and tasty sandwich. I like it when BBQ sauce meets pineapple. It is one awesome combination.

Earl of Sandwich is located inside Planet Hollywood and is a fast food-type joint. But better. From my memory, they have about 10-12 different sandwiches and more salads and wraps. But please, try a sandwich. I ordered the Full Montagu, which has roast beef and turkey in it. I waited less than 10 minutes for my sandwich and sat in the restaurant to eat. The sandwich was quite a delight. After eating at buffets the day before, it was nice to bite into something fresh and more light. All the ingredients were fresh. I especially like tomatoes and bread. Oh the bread!! The start of a good sandwich is the bread and this place got it right.

First time I tasted Earl's sandwiches was at Downtown Disney in Florida.  After an exhausting all-day visit at Magic Kingdom, we decided to call it the day but not before heading to Downtown Disney where we discovered this gem and became a believer that there is a sandwich maker who would topple the likes of Quiznos, Togos and all the others.  At last, a sandwich establishment worth writing about.

My very first Earl sandwich was the Rueben and it was delectable (I don't think they still have it on the menu) ; made me forget the whole day of walking that I endured.  From that day, I vowed to seek this establishment back home in California but quickly discovered its non-existence. Sad days indeed.  Then one day I was relieved when I heard that Las Vegas opened up a franchise. 

On my much anticipated return last month, I indulged on the goodness of The Full Montagu and Tuna Melt.  Both of which are hot sandwiches and are scrumptious. Did it live up to the hype once, twice, thrice, etc?  Abso-Earlutely...

M-eat meat meat. The roasted beef was a shocker to my mouth. How could something that looks so simple taste so smooth and delicious? Perfectly soft, perfectly chewy, and just enough flavor that only an Earl's can achieve.

A-nd after all that I was thrown off by another memorable discovery. The bread. Warm, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the most perfectly toasted crust gently surrounding the outsides of my sandwich.

It's definitely NOT the ""world's greatest hot sandwich"" but it's tasty, cheap, quick and convenient. Eat here if you don't feel like dropping $50 on buffet and want something better than McDonalds.

I recommend the ORIGINAL 1762 and FULL MONTAGU sandwiches.

--------------

ORIGINAL 1762 - A little skimpy on the meat portions but flavorful throughout the sandwich with just the right amount of horse radish and cheese. (fyi- Meat is not consistent. One of the sandwiches was medium rare and the other was well done). 

FULL MONTAGU- Get this if you want veggies and more bang for your buck. Sandwich is about 1\/4inch taller than the 1762.

--------------

TIPS:

1. DO NOT go 3 times in 24hours. You'll get sick of it and end up forcing it down or keeping it for later and eating it cold.

2. Visit after the clubs. Plenty of rowdy, drunk entertaining customers. 
Highlights include:  A drunk guy trying to fight two other drunk guys because he thought they were taking pictures of his ugly drunk gf, funny drunk pick up lines and lot's of people with food on their shirts.

3. Order a side of macaroni salad and put it inside your 1762.",2,3,2

Only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. Most I've waited was about 30 mins. Reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the Spice Market Buffet which is also good. Even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. Or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. I haven't had much time waiting for my order after I've ordered and paid but I've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. Plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. You'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. First batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. 

I've tried most of their sandwiches here. Highlights for me are their Holiday Turkey, Full Montagu, Chipotle Chicken Avocado and their Hawaiian BBQ.

On my last trip to Vegas, i decided that i wouldn't be a sucker anymore. I wanted to have a good meal, at a reasonable price, and if i have to walk half the strip, then so be it. I searched on yelp and Earl of Sandwich came up. A deja-vu moment came back, since I've been to Planet Hollywood before and recalled having briefly seen this spot, not far after you enter the hotel\/ casino. I trekked my way from MGM to PH, for this. Worth the 82 degrees heat, and the 15 min walk. And alas, i can't place Earl in any of the 3 categories of the Vegas dining scene. I guess i am mentally creating a new category: good & cheap! (I believe Earl's is a chain, but it's too good to be put in the same league as the other chain restaurants). 

It was just the 2 of us, but since I wanted to give a fair review of the food, we got 3 sandwiches for variety: the Full Montagu, The Ham 'n' Swiss and The All American. The Full Montagu is my favorite, with just the right amount of meat (roast beef and turkey), 2 types of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) and a good slab of the house mustard sauce.The All American is like thanksgiving on a sandwich (it has cranberries, turkey, cheese). The ham and swiss is the most boring choice of the 3, but it's good quality ham n' cheese sandwich.

This is located in the miracle mile shops and you can spot it as soon as you enter. Usually there is a long line but they have an efficient way of handling their orders so it moves quickly. First, you tell the worker what you want, then move down to the register and tell the cashier what you ordered. Sandwich gets made pretty quickly after. 

So this is a good place to go if you need a quick bite and you're hungry. However, do not expect the best tasting sandwich.  Ordered the Reuben and there was barely any meat and it was extremely thin. Not enough sour kraut either and the bread was nothing to write home about. It felt oily and heavy too despite the sandwich not having much content.

雖然最早的體驗是來自於南加州迪士尼樂園的分店，但是造訪頻率最高的還是在來到賭城之時，在賭城的分店二十四小時全天候的營業時間能夠滿足早餐、午餐、晚餐、宵夜的需求。

許多間賭場裡頭都可以看到Earl of Sandwich的店舖開設，但還是Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino裡頭的最具規模，畢竟都是同個老闆，氣勢當然要維持著。

三明治之所以叫三明治，來自於兩百五十多年以前的歷史，以及現今對於市場行銷靈活的頭腦與巧思。

特別強調的企業精神，就是對於食物風味的堅持，其實看到上方那個成立的年份就會讓人感到肅然起敬了。

以上的就是這裡主打的各種口味三明治，實際品嚐過的幾種風味都挺不錯的，有機會再來把所有口味都嘗試一遍。這裡的三明治體積比起坊間的其它競爭者略小，憑藉著就是風味來吸引顧客，尤其是熱的三明治。

雖然是以三明治作為主打，但輕食風格的沙拉或是卷餅也是蠻受歡迎的用餐選擇。

如同多數三明治餐廳一般的點餐流程，在菜單上固定的口味之外也可以加入個人風格的客製化調味，只要在點餐時跟服務人員提起。結帳後送上呼叫機，等候餐點做好的通知。

在主打的三明治等餐點之外，也有多種搭配的小點心可以點用，尤其是每日烘培的小糕點，透過透明塑膠包裝看到裡頭的內容也是挺誘人的。

目光打轉著可以點用的飲料選擇，除了一般的軟性飲料與適合搭配三明治的果汁或乳品，還是要有賭城的特色可以點用酒精性飲料，看著看著手中的呼叫機也亮起發出振動，可以到餐臺取餐了。

通常造訪這裡的時候都是帶著三分醉意五分睡意，買回去旅館房間內躺在床上食用，但餐廳店內的環境也不差。

當然選擇在店內食用可以透過店家提供的多種醬料來增添用餐體驗。

現點現做的新鮮三明治，包裝在帶有亮眼光澤的錫箔紙中送入顧客手中，點用的口味都會清楚地透過上頭的貼紙來辨別。

在義大利餐廳廣受歡迎的前菜點心，以帶有香滑食感的水牛乳起司 Mozzarella、搭配多汁酸香的蕃茄、再加上富有特殊清香的羅勒、再加上義大利香醋畫龍點睛，透過三明治的方式來呈現這道經典的風味，也只有在 Earl of Sandwich 吃得到。

夏威夷風格烤肉風味的三明治，選用了全麥的麵包經過烘烤後多了一分香氣，而來自烤雞肉、火腿、鳳梨、瑞士起司的組合，那種香中帶甜、甜中透酸、酸味又透著肉香，不僅是在宵夜時段讓人吃來胃口大開，作為一日之際的開端的早餐想當然也是會讓人吃來精神飽滿。

酸香的蕃茄與酒醋加上起司的乳香、或是BBQ烤肉醬那種濃郁的煙薰香氣，兩種截然不同的口味，卻都是讓人在酒酣耳熱之際，用來鎮壓胃囊裡頭那隻酒蟲為身體帶來舒暢感受的良方。

而說到Earl 的三明治，就不得不提這個作為招牌口味、冠上名號的「The Full Montagu」，包裹在閃爍著耀眼金色光芒的錫箔紙中，在人飢餓到不能自己的時候，確實就像是看到金塊一般握在手掌心中讓人喜悅無比。

作為最具有人氣的口味，The Full Montagu 強調的就是一種類似總匯三明治，那種透過多樣食材組合而成的美味，火雞胸肉、烤牛肉、巧達起司、瑞士起司、生菜葉、蕃茄，一口咬下各種風味融合成一體，是深夜之中帶領飢餓肚皮走向飽滿舒暢的明燈。

夜深人靜，卻需要一點香氣與熱量的幫助才能入眠的話，這確實是一股會讓人想念的風味，可惜南加州的分店都早早關門休息，還是期待下次咱們在賭城這個不夜國度再次相遇了！",0,0,0

The Best BLT is good too. I don't like it as much as the italian but its way better than your everyday BLT. Bacon, roma tomatoes, lettuce and tasty mayo.

The Earl's Club is very good. Perfect marriage of bacon, turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & a sauce that is indescribably good.

Earl's is good for lunch, dinner, after-club snack or it's 4am and there's nothing better to eat at the casino than this sandwich type of meal. It's the perfect sammich. It's just the right amount to make you want another one but somehow one is just right. I cant explain it. It hits the spot.

You go to a few different sandwich shops on different days to pick up some goods to indulge your nom nom feeling. Say you like the BLT or the Club and that's what you get every time, regardless.  You choose these because you focus on the what's being sandwiched between the two pieces of bread.  The bread is seriously just some edible cushion to keep your hands from getting messy from eating the goodness of what's inside the sandwich.  It's the law of sandwich bread.

You come in Earl of Sandwich and that law is completely broken. You can get ANY sandwich, and despite which one you get, it WILL be a winner.  The highlight of each sandwich IS the bread. It's perfectly toasted on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside. It truly disgusts me to even think about how beautiful sandwich bread could be. A dinky picture and even this review can barely describe the wonders of their bread. You're probably thinking, ""Damn, this girl is seriously trippin' about the bread"", and you know what? Yeah, I am. It's seriously that good. Okay, thats enough on bread.

The Full Montagu is very delicious and the roast beef was tender.

The Club tasted so fresh and the bacon gave it a nice crunch.

The Carribean Jerk is a must have if you want loads of flavor in your sandwich.

I've also tried some of their wonderfully made soups:

Tomato Soup- was thick, creamy, and had croutons in it. My boyfriend ordered the food while I was away in one of the stores, and the soup was sitting for awhile. I came back, all sad faced, because the croutons were going to be soggy.... or atleast that's what I thought. It was 100% crunchy and the soup was at a perfect hot temperature. If you like tomato soup, it's a MUST have.

Broccoli Cheese Soup- was also very creamy and flavorful. It was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away ). 

Expect to stand in a line during hungry hours; You get a pager when your food is ready. Trust me, its worth the wait! The sandwiches are your ordinary sandwich prices and soups are also well priced. I honestly believe it tastes like a million bucks though.... nothing compares to these sandwiches.

One of the best parts is, is that my hotel was a 3 minute walking distance from Planet Hollywood ( @ the Marriot ) and I literally could walk here ANY part of the day\/night ( 24-hour service!!!! ) to grab a nomster sandwich.

I'm seriously coming here EVERY time I visit Vegas!

The Full Montagu has turkey, roast beef and is held together very nicely by cheese and it's fantastic toasted bread.  The tomato soup will warm your soul after losing Jr.'s college fund on the Baccarat table. It's like Spaghetti-O's minus the O's, which I am fond of.  They throw croutons in there to sweeten the deal.

Luckily, I had not yet began binge drinking and was able to read up on some world history.  This Earl dude (maybe his name was John), invented the sandwich during a card game in jolly old England. I always thought the sandwich was an American invention.  It's Brit.  Damn you, history.  Damn you for opening my eyes to the truth.

And now for your sandwich tip (yeah baby, tip) of the day.  Their HP steak sauce would make anything better.  If you douse your TV with it, it might stop you from putting your foot through your LCD when Oprah is on.  By the way, it's Canadian.  Have you noticed how our friend, the sandwich has been hiding behind a wall of deceit?  Perhaps it's all for the best that there aren't many Earl of Sandwiches around.

Dude, there's like a ton of other places to grab something to eat, are these all yelp people here? haha! Whatever, I would of waited an hour to try this place.

The breakdown:

Full Montagu: great combination of quality meat, veggies tasted fresh, bread wasn't the normal subway style bread I was expecting but it was soft and delicious.

Holiday Turkey: I almost cried after eating this!! You know the ""Bobbie"" sandwich from Capriotti's?.. Well, this is similar but to the 10th degree!! This sandwich was out of control! The turkey meat soft and juicy and cranberry filling was sweet and mouth watering!.. It really is indescribable, try it yourself.. I think its only available for a limited time, don't miss out..

Tuna Melt: Unbelieveably Fluffy and another Jackpot Sandwich that I don't have words to describe. One of the Best Tuna Melts I've ever had! And I love Tuna Melts and have tried many different ones..

Best BLT: Bold name for this sandwich, which does taste how it should. You really can't go wrong with bacon, lettuce and tomato. Nothing special though.

Meatball: A little salty for my taste but nevertheless it was good. I love meatball sandwiches and I've tried many others better than this.

Okay so I only ordered a Tuna salad, because I really wasn't that hungry, but my other gfs ordered sandwiches and according to them it was an overall, 'Mehh.'  

'Mehh' as in..you can find a much better bang for your buck at a local sandwich shop in your neck of the woods. Items aren't expensive so I give them that. They have everything you would find: hot sandwiches (duh), wraps, salads, coffee\/tea, potato chips, breakfast options, and even dessert ! There's a lot of history behind this franchise..250 years to be exact so they must be doing something right ?! Uhh..right ?? Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable.

Earl of Sandwich is like Subway - As in, you place a sandwich shop all by its' lonesome away from potential competition and not many food options available and you'll get hoards of people to come in. Smart Earl. Real smart. Due to its' Vegas location (i.e., inside Planet Hollywood), I'm not surprised many people line up here. This is an easy 'grab n go' meal-type setting and when in Viva Las Vegas, sometimes you just want a quick fix while you go around galavanting Sin City.  

Okay..so on to my food:

How can you mess up Tuna salad right ? Well, you sure can in this case. Waaaay overdressed and it reminded me of 'cafeteria food' where the ladies in aprons and hair nets use those hand scoopers to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray. Ya..I got a tuna ball *insert imagination* ! I should have known better, but I was really craving a salad. Is this premade? I could have sworn I saw some tossing up front. Oh..and I hate when they dress the salad for you. I like it on the side. I should have asked prior, but everyone seemed to be in a rush to order and move out the way. So I grabbed my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merry way.

Rating Scale from 1-5:

Appearance: Ball of Tuna = 1  
Taste: Mushy, overdressed, still edible = 2
Originality: If cafeteria food is original, then I MUST be from another planet = -1

Overall score: 2 stars because I enjoyed my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasn't that expensive (thank goodness !)

So maybe I should have gotten a damn sandwich, but I wasn't feelin' it at the time and my gfs weren't that impressed by it either. Would I give this place another shot ? If I had no other choice, maybe. Ok yes. No maybe. Ha !",8,7,7

It was named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English aristocrat... It is said that he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread... It is said that Lord Sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards, particularly cribbage, while eating without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands.

If Wikipedia said it, it must be true.

Caribbean Jerk Chicken is absolutely splendid, though you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Bread is freshly made and toasted, meat is meaty and plentiful, and sauces and other sandwich toppings perfectly complement the bread and meat to form the perfect sandwich.

The reason for the lower rating is that the last time I went, their 'system went down for 30 minutes' which apparently means they aren't able to make a sandwich.  So there were 10 or so employees standing around with knives, meat and bread right in front of them.  I'm guessing either the employees wouldn't know how to count change without a computer, or the management has no plan in place to service the customer when something like that happens.

Location\/parking: Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino right across from the sports bar.

Seating\/wait: Quick moving line if you want to order. Better to send someone from your party to find a table during busy times.

Service: Order over the counter. Sit and enjoy!

Food:
-Tomato soup with croutons (I asked for it on the side). This is hands down my favorite tomato soup every. EWW!!! Tomato soup. No really. I usually don't order tomato soup but I've ordered this every time I've been here. I suggest asking for croutons on the side.

-Potato salad cup from fridge: it's a 2 star. It's as if you got potato salad from a super market.
-Sugar cookie: pretty good\/ok.
-Brownie creme (looks like oreo whoopee): I thought it was ok.

 We had to run downtown today, and decided to grab a sandwich and watch the flocking tourist. As expected there was a decent line of approx. 15 people a head of us. We patient;y waited our turn and made our order. (Cuban, Holiday Turkey, and The full Mont.) We got out numbered pager, drinks, and headed into the packed dinning room for a table. We lucked out, grabbed a warm table that just lifted. 
  Less than ten min. pass and our sandwiches are ready. I open the Cuban first, warm, toasty and looked delicious. My wife had the Holiday Turkey that was just as good looking. The first bite for both of us was a religious experience, we put a lot of expectations into these sandwiches, and they did not fail to step up with a quality product. We shared all three and enjoyed each and every bite. My favorite was the Holiday Turkey that my wife ordered. It is that mid night sandwich you sneak into the kitchen on Thanksgiving night to make when the family is asleep. We were unable to find a flaw with any of our choices.

- It's about 385% better tasting than Subway, and around the same price.
- It's located indoors in between an air conditioned casino and a huge mall, so there's lots to do around afterwards.

CONS:
- The lines get super long at lunch time any day of the week.
- Their salads aren't that awesome, but you really shouldn't be getting a salad at a place called ""Earl of Sandwich"".  Wait until they open a joint called ""Earl of Greens"".",2,3,2

For my last Vegas trip (two weeks ago). My friends and I would come here for dinner and order a sandwich haha. We would eat half of it there and save the other half to eat after clubbing! It is still amazing after a couple of hours :). Earls after a night of drinking is super awesome!

I've been coming here for years on every single one of my Vegas trip. It's in the nice hip Planet Hollywood (where all the 20 year olds stay). Right across from Cosmo, next door to Paris. Great location for all your drunkards needs after Marquee or Hakka. 

The sandwiches are GREAT and delicious. I never remember what I order (sorry!) either I'm too hungry or too drunk to remember, or maybe it's not that great of a sandwich to remember? After all these years I don't think I would ever find out. Haha. The prices are decent. However, one annoying thing I need to point out is that during EDC weekend the lines were... about 30min to 45min long! I honestly don't think its worth to stay in that long of a line for this joint. I recommend going to Pink's a few doors down, NO LINE for bomb hot dogs. But I will come back here on my other Vegas trips during non busy weekends!

After yelping a spot open at 3am, we headed down here and made the three mile walk to get some grub after gambling and drinking. In my mind I was set on a delicious sandwich with so many reviews, and 4 1\/2 stars! We get there, and from the get go I kind of knew I was about to be disappointed by the red haired ""manager"" fella' that was talking about some inappropriate crap with his. what seemed to be teenage employee. He seemed in his late 30's, balding, and really doing nothing but slapping a sticker on the wrappers of the sandwiches. The only one I would give credit to, is the poor Hispanic gal that was literally making all of the sandwiches, and the Asian cashier girl who was very pleasant, but mischarged me twice. I ordered per the recommendation of the young kid, who I guess was on break as he stood there, watching customers stand in line while doing not a damn thing, the roast beef sandwich. 

Grabbed my sandwich, and headed for the tables ready to chomp on this sub like a fat kid out of camp. Took a ""Jaws"" type bite, and had a Jaws type result of doing so.. the sub was BLOODY. I had an argument with my sister on how that's not coloring of the beef, but how it was raw and bloody. I was so furious after spitting up what i had just bitten, that I grabbed my drink and didn't even want a refund. The manager it seemed like was full of himself for someone who works at a sub spot, and I wasn't about to go to jail over a $8 sub. All in all terrible experience. I hope it was just that day, maybe the staff at that time? But would I ever try this spot again? NO! You go to Vegas to have a good time gambling, drinking and of course EATING! 

Pros: There was a worldpoker tournament going on in front? Free refills I guess.

Cons: It's Vegas, so many other actual good places to chow down on, don't know how it got so many likes.

Overall: Save yourself the time, hassle, and money. This place is way too over hyped, and was really the only crappy thing about my recent Vegas trip. Mind you I lost like $500, and this was still the highlight.",0,0,0

24\/7 Earl of sandwich tucked inside  Planet Hollywood's mile mall. There was no line at 2:00am. I know there is usually a line, just like the Downtown Disney spot, but we were lucky.  Lots of seating to accomondate different sizes of groups from booths to large tables.

The Chipoltle chicken with avacado is amazingly yummy. Chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon,  lettuce, avacado snuggled inside a 6 inch toasted white of wheat roll smeared with a tastey chipoltle sauce.

The Italian was a hit with the hubsters. Asked for some extra mayo and mustard packs to squeeze all over the bread. Paired it with a side of Mac and Cheese. Perfect meal.

Lets talk size. These sammies are SMALL. You will be hungry after you inhale one into your tummy. Get a side and some chips to go with it, or even a salad. You won't regret it. You will regret just eating a sandwich because you will bd starving.

Self serve Pepsi products, Earl Grey iced tea, lemonade, and hot tea available. Along with Peets coffee. I slurrped 2 glasses if Unsweetened tea. Then I iced my coffee. It was kind of tricky, but I made it work. 

It is a win win here. My entire party enjoyed their meals. Price was reasonable. Only complaint was the size.

My wife and I had dinner our first night - we just wanted something simple and inexpensive and the Earl provides said same.

I ordered the Italian and was a bit surprised when it arrived warm - all the Earl 'signature' sandwiches are served panini style. As noted previously, the sandwich is about the size of a 6-inch Subway. I probably would have liked the sandwich better had the meats been cold as I was thinking more of a Hoagie style Italian. I also ordered the broccoli and cheddar soup - which was quite good.

The next morning we had breakfast at the Earl of Sandwich - it is the only place in the Miracle Mile that opens before 7 AM - it's Vegas Baby - and my wife was attending a conference, so we needed an early breakfast. I had the egg, cheddar and bacon sandwich and my wife ordered the ham variation. Both were quite good.

So, there I am...it's lunch. Heard good stuff about this place. Smelled pretty good while in line. Got the usual ""I really hate my job, but I'm too lazy to find something else"" smileless service at the register. You know, I'm okay with food service apathy. Order placed, order taken, time to wait. 

Understand, I'm a chill dude. Lunch arrives. Not a big deal, but I asked for extra sauce on my sandwich. Well, I got NO sauce for my troubles. No problem. I approach the counter, sandwich in hand. One, two, three employees walk by without even a sideways glance. ""Ummm, excuse me..."" I utter. Gawd, I really don't want to be ""that guy"". The young lady that took my order finally acknowledges me. ""Yes?"" Seriously? I smile, point to my dry sandwich & asked if I could get some sauce for my sandwich. She picks up the plate & dumps everything in the trash. ""I'll have them make you a new one."" All I wanted was sauce. Then the manager appears and asks why she tossed the food in the trash, berating her in front of me. The manager muttered ""sorry"" in my general direction before disappearing to oversee the construction of my sandwich. There must be some sort of conspiratorial pact amongst the crew as my sandwich reappeared...drowning in the sauce to the point of in-edibility. I salvaged what I could from the remnants & have moved on. 

The sad part is that someone truly takes pride in the product. Unfortunately, it's not the employees. Maybe I hit them on an off day. The revues are decent, but based upon my recent adventure, I probably won't be racing back soon. My advice to those of you in shitty jobs...the more miserable you feel, the longer your shift.

I came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. 

Let me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!

So on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. 

Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: ""We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap"".

I stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! 

I spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. 

Walking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.

By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding ""WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!""

Mr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), ""Corporate happened.""

When I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.

And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!",8,12,4

Tuna Melt - Good stuff. Warm, slightly gooey and hearty. I do make sure to add some hot sauce or horseradish because the sandwich is a bit one note

Italian - All the standard italian meats plus capicola, which is my favorite. A bit of a kick with the acid and spices

Hawaiian BBQ - The most memorable of the sandwiches I've eaten. The sweetness and tangyness of the sauce and pineapple is great. The chicken is tender. One of my favorites

The Original - Classic roast beef. The beef is tender but a bit dry sometimes. The horseradish adds a much needed kick to an otherwise simple flavor profile. I wish it came with some kind of au jus

Next, each sandwich is comprised of an ample amount of meat\/lettuce\/dressings\/etc where each and every delightful bite is full of flavor and satisfaction.    If only they played EDM....Earl's would be borderline culinary bliss.

Their pricing is extremely competitive, especially for the Vegas Strip. Each sandwich is priced @ $5.99, with additional costs for double meat (really not necessary).  Another amazing aspect of Earls? IT""S OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY!!! Which means, one can wander over there drunk, intoxicated, and eat probably the best tasting sandwich in drunken memory and then even bring one back in case you happen to throw up before the night.  Unlike the other 24 hr joints, which tend to have long, inefficient waits, the line @ earls breezes through as they have an awesome system of those vibrating ringers that alerts you when your sandwich is ready.

Recommendations: The Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl's Club (only if you like bacon as it has a prominent taste in the sandwich).

I had the ""Full Montague"" and my wife the ""Club Sandwich"". Both were done just right with tasty sauces on bread that could stand up to the true test of a sandwich, which is, can you eat it holding it in one hand with poker cards in the other hand? This means the sandwich is stacked right, pressed correctly, not too moist to soggy out the bun, does not dribble parts of it down your shirt and most importantly not fall apart. If it meets those criteria AND tastes fantastic you got yourself a winning sandwich. And at ""Earl of Sandwich"" you got yourself a winning sandwich.

I am not going to go into more details; the other 1186 reviews will state more than I can ever write.

""Earl of Sandwich"" people, if you are reading this, open up one of these in North Las Vegas. I will drive to it; I will eat there... OFTEN. Please please please open one nearby. Amen!",2,1,2

This is my absolute favorite place for a quick meal in Las Vegas. There are no other places on the strip that have such affordable prices for such delicious hot sandwiches. 

Every time I'm in Vegas, we make at least two to three trips to Earl of Sandwich just because it's so delicious and it's open 24 hours. I would stay at Planet Hollywood just because they have this place downstairs near the Casino. 

I've tried a few of the sandwiches and they are all very good. But my favorite has to be the All-American! Hot turkey cranberry sandwich with ranch? You can't beat that!

If you're staying in any hotel near to Planet Hollywood, you HAVE to go give Earl's a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.",2,2,2

Here, they don't just serve the average Subway\/Quizno sandwiches but THE WORLDS GREATEST HOT SANDWICHES. Yes, it is not just the pompous advertisement, it is actually really good. Each sandwich is prepared with artisan bread that is made by hand and freshly baked-to-order through a conveyor oven. Then at the end, the staff will put in the fillings, wrap it up, and put a sticker on it. The bread is piping hot and the filling is holy delicious. They have an extensive menu, so not only do they sell hot sandwiches, they also have a variety of wraps, soups, hand-tossed salad, and cupcakes. We got two of their signature hot sandwiches. The first one was Cannonballs for $6.99 with meatballs, mozzarella, Parmesan & marinara sauce. The meatball was so tender and flavorful. My friend got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado for $6.99 with grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and chipotle sauce. This one was yummy not as good as the meatball sandwich in my opinion.

As for the actual food, it's pretty damn cheap for what you get: a quality sandwich for under $10 (and when I say quality, I mean quality). I tried a few sandwiches here (got  2 on my first trip, and came during different times of the day), and they're all pretty good. I tried my friend's soup which wasn't the best, but still decent for what it was.

Happened to be in Planet Hollywood after a show and wanted a quick light meal. I remembered reading about Earl of Sandwich before. Even though this place has an average of 4.5 stars on Yelp, I was still skeptical. I didn't think I could trust the opinions of some drunk gamblers and crazy tourists. I couldn't be more wrong.

All American Sandwich - sweet cranberries, savory melted cheese and roasted turkey on freshly grilled sandwich bread matched with crunchy lettuce and juicy tomato slices. The result is an addicting complex flavor that lingers on your tongue and leaves you wanting more. 

The Earl's Cobb Wrap - This wrap variation of their most popular hot sandwich is just as memorable. The old wrap has the perfect texture. Thick enough to not get soggy yet still soft and not grainy at all. The fillings were amazing.

A hoagie\/sandwich is one of those things where the major components all add to the overall experience.  You can't just have one component carry the slack for the rest of the components.  A lot of times I'll find a place where the meats are great, but the bread is terrible or vice versa.

I had the Full Montague here.  The bread was fresh; it actually had a great crust and was chewy on the inside as well.  The right bread is the hardest thing to find in most places. The meat itself is top notch, and is just as good as Boar's Head branded meat, if it isn't actually Boar's Head.  I liked this place much better than Capriotti's; if you're a fan of hoagies from Philly or NY come here. 

This place always seem to have a super long line whenever I walk past, but it seems to move quickly.  They have call ahead ordering and I recommend doing that to skip the line.

Upon arrival, there was a long line of individuals, yet it moved expeditiously. The menu is relatively simple, showcasing a smattering of signature sandwiches. I opted to try the Earl's Club that consisted of roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss, lettuce, and tomatoes. Wow! So delicious. The bread, too, was surprisingly fresh. My travel companion ordered the Hawaiian Barbeque that was constructed of ham, chicken, swiss, pineapple and bbq sauce. Staggeringly good! 

In addition to my sandwich, I also had a small cup of the broccoli and cheddar soup. It was hot, creamy, and packed with rich flavor. Impressive.

For a little over $5 a sandwich, it's really hard to do much better on price, especially considering you're on the Strip.

It was just enough to get me through what remained of the night.

As for the price, it wasn't too bad. The sandwich was decent -- it wasn't like, ""OMG I'M HAVING A MOUTHGASM THIS VERY MOMENT. I WANT IT EVERYDAY"" sorta thing. It was just..... good. In fact, the only thing that makes this sandwich good was the fact that it was all about the BREAD! It was heated to perfection, which made the cheese melt and the meat to be all sorts of steamy. My drink was eh.

The interior was like a fancy subway, nothing too fancy.

Overall, it was good-- wasn't super amazing like everyone claims. However, this place is a good place to eat, especially if you're low on cash in Vegas. As for coming back, maybe. I wouldn't say I'm a super fan, but it is good.

Sandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!

My favorite sandwich would have to be the Tuna Melt, but the Montagu and Earl Club are also delish! The Cannonball was just ok. I probably wouldn't get that again. 

If the line is a bit daunting, all you have to do is make a phone order and pick up your sandwich when it's ready at the cash register. No need to wait in that ridiculous line. Even better, if you're staying in Planet Hollywood and you don't want to go out for a meal, you can make the call from your room and lounge around while you wait.

I wouldn't go as far as saying Earl's has the best sandwiches ever (perhaps that's the drunken Vegas talk\/hype), but they definitely do sandwiches right. It's a great way to get a quick and cheap meal when time and money are tight, which is pretty often while you're in Vegas.

the location is amazingly convenient (which is one of the reasons why they get so much foot traffic). i've seen their lines stretch at east 30 or 40 people deep- breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the wait is well worth it. their ordering system is highly efficient (which is a relief), and although there may come a time where there isn't enough room in their dining area to enjoy your sandwich there, it's still just as satisfying if you take it to go and bring it back up to your room at the Westgate Towers or other nearby hotel.

the tuna melt and hawaiian sandwiches are my favorite, but the jerk chicken or montagus are also great. much like the buffets, Earl's is a 'must try' for those enjoying Las Vegas for the first time. you'll find yourself always going back on subsequent trips to enjoy one of their hot sandwiches. and it's open 24 hours = makes a great breakfast or late night\/post-clubbing meal as well.

My buddy and I arrived to PH and walked around trying to find Earl of Sandwich for a few minutes. We found it by it's line. Yeah, this joint is both a tourist hot spot and local locale. Straight bumpin'.

The menu is huge. I took a sneak peak, and I suggest you do the same if you're popping your Earl cherry, at the sandwiches that are offered at EoS. They've got more than sammies, but nothing appealed to me [lettuce isn't my cup of tea].

I wound up ordering two sandwiches, one for the lady and one for myself. We got the tuna and the Full Montagu [not to be confused with the foes of the Capulets]. The lady friend said, and I quote, ""this is the best tuna sandwich that I've ever had."" So I guess it's aight. As for the Full Montagu? Shawty rockin' to the beat for ya boyyyy. Geez, Louise. Folks talk about the roast beef...and there is good reason. It makes this, and probably any, sandwich.

Service is fast and fun; the guy who took our order gave me a nice ""Thank you. Come again"" at the end of our transaction. I looked at him with a ""are you serious"" look and we both laughed. The crew takes their time creating these sammies, so be patient. I mean, what's five minutes? Just stand off to the side with your order-pager and watch some television. They've got plenty of flat screens all over the place.

I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.

The sandwich was mouth watering delicious.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.  The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste.

(although you have to hurry if you enter through the Planet Hollywood entrance; try and use the Miracle mile shop entrance to avoid being harassed by pit bosses and the like.) 
I have tried their house sandwich and roast beef, both of them taste alright. But the Tuna Melt is absolutely perfect, I really mean perfect. You can make no amount of spices or make any other adjustment to that sandwich which will make it taste any better! 

Pros: 
*Best tuna melt in the US. Maybe the world.
*Price (~$6)

Cons: 
*Long lines.",1,0,0

Sandwiches tried: 
Moi= the full montagu thanks to the multiple yelp recommendation. Tis was good. Just good.
The bf= (limited edition) chipotle chicken avocado. GREAT delicious sandwich! I was doubting him because I couldn't find it on any yelp reviews... but it is because they only offer this little piece of heaven once in a while. I regret not buying another one for the ride back.

Had the Montagu and the Italian. The Montagu was perfect with the combo of melt in your mouth roast beef and cheese. The flavor was balanced with every component so it wasn't salty at all, even at your last bite. 

Italian was still very good, just not as perfect as the Montagu. Italian normally would be very salty due to all the salami but this one only has a light salt kick. Personal preference would be a tad more tomatoes but still good. 

The bread on both sandwiches were perfect. Slightly crispy on the outside with soft and fresh inside. 

The sandwich size is a lil small for my taste. I wouldn't mind paying another dollar for a slightly bigger sandwich. If you order the meal or a side, then the portions would be perfect. 

So I took a star away because the person who took my sandwich order was impatient. She tried up-selling me to the meal (drink and chips).

I shared the sandwiches family style with my friends and we tried the the Original, the Full Montague and the All American. I chose the All American because love cranberry with turkey. So delish! The seasonal special was a another turkey sandwich with cranberries and the fixin's. I was tempted to try that too! 

All the sandwiches were delicious and stuffed to the brim with meat and veggies. I'm  not sure which one I liked the best, but I found that the Full Montague and the All American tasted similar. The original had a stronger taste to it due to the horse radish sauce. I totally could have just ate half of a sandwich and been full. The portion size is good. For about $5.99 per sandwich it's a great deal! The lined moved super fast and the sandwiches came out super fast too. They have their system totally down. 

Just one thing to note, make sure that you check your recipe after you order and make sure it's what you really want. We originally ordered The Club, but the guy at the register put down the Full Montague on our receipt and we were unwrapping our sandwich when we noticed the mix up.

I mean, OK.  It IS fast (counter service only) and cheap (by Vegas terms, anyway).  Sandwiches run about $6.  But they're not that great.  I had Le Frenchy, which is ham, brie, and dijon mustard.  It was OK, but I couldn't even detect the brie on the sandwich, which was the entire reason I ordered it in the first place.  Liz C. had the ultimate grilled cheese, which was supposed to have three different types of cheese on it (and bacon!), and you could barely detect the cheese on *her* sandwich.  The bread everyone is raving about tastes a lot like Schlotzsky's bread to me - which, you know, is fine, just not ""special.""  I also tried one of their cupcakes with sprinkles and it was kind of gross.  I've made yellow cakes out of a box that tasted better than this thing did.

Earl of Sandwich, thank you for providing a relatively inexpensive, 24-hour option with some healthy selections in the middle of a casino.  Even if your Cobb salad didn't quite seem like a ""Cobb salad"" to me (no egg, no avocado, had Swiss\/cheddar cheese and Ranch buttermilk dressing, and was not chopped - but, was fresh). 

The tomato soup is a touch creamier than I would like but still had a nice tomato tang, and had nice big croutons swimming in it. 

I sampled both the ""Cannonballs"" meatball sandwich and the Original 1762 roast beef sandwich.  Both were on what I suppose is Earl of Sandwich's signature bread, which is pretty good.  It looks a little crusty, but is still quite soft and spongy, and chewy.

Both sandwiches were pretty good.  The meatball sandwich had enough meatballs to fill the sandwich, the sauce was nice and tomato-y, and there was melty cheesiness, but not too much.  About what you expect from a meatball sandwich, when nothing goes wrong.  The roast beef sandwich was also good.  I liked the horseradish and would have preferred a little more of that, and a little less creaminess, but that is just me.

Overall, this is not a place I would travel out of my way for.  But, it is a great option to have in the middle of the Las Vegas strip, when your wallet doesn't feel like going big for the evening.",0,0,0

I personally don't think it's unique and amazing that'd i'd wait an hour in line for it. It's located inside Planet Hollywood which is convenient to Aria, Vdara, Cosmo, Planet Hollywood residents since it's nearby. 

Honestly, from the prices of things lately, I would consider this place dirt cheap for food, but considering everything edible in Vegas is super cheap, I no longer find it a positive for this place versus others. I think what it has going for it is the 24\/7 service and convenience. It's crowded late at night and early in the mornings, so I'd say if you want to go here, definitely go during meal hours because that's when people actually eat real meals.

The long answer of it all is that it will not be as ridiculously amazing as everyone hypes it up to be on yelp, but it is unarguably a good and delicious sandwich. What makes an Earls sandwich even better is that everything is made fresh to order, its available 24\/7, and in a city where all your money goes to dealers, alcohol and strippers, you'll certainly appreciate the affordability of an Earls sandwich to fill that hungry belly.

My two personal favorites here are The Full Montagu and Tuna Melt. But there isn't exactly a wrong choice of sandwiches here. I've tried The Original 1762, Earl's Club, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, All American, Ham n Swiss, Caprese, and Italian and while some taste better than others, they're all in the end very good. Also if you have some spare change in your pocket, I really recommend Earl's Slaw -- crisp and refreshing and not bogged down with too much mayo.

My friends and I came here the last time I was in Las Vegas.  The time before that, I had wanted to go but no one else seemed to have wanted sandwiches.

First of all the breads here are amazing.  They're baked perfectly.  I don't think you can bake a more perfect bread than the Earl of Sandwich.  Because of this perfectly made bread, basically ANYTHING you order here will be delicious.  Subway couldn't make a bread roll better than the Earl of Sandwich.  No Banh Mi bread will ever measure up.

I got the Italian Sandwich here which came with Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomatoes.  The sandwiches were not too big that you'd get stuffed.  It was the perfect size.

We ordered the chicken chipotle avocado sandwich, the pastrami Reuben and tortilla soup. Both sandwiches were delicious! The sauce in the chicken chipotle sandwich was so tasty. It had a slight sweetness to it. And the pastrami in the Reuben was very fresh. Usually, you'll get a rubbery texture from pastrami at places like subway or togos but the pastrami here was much like Ike's (if you've ever had it). It was easy to bite through. And the tortilla soup was sooo tasty. So many flavors going on in there! And the tortilla chips on too add a nice crunch to the soup.

Upon tasting, I didn't taste anything different maybe except for the bread. I do love how soft and chewy it is, even though it was baked. Baked...hmm. Isn't Quizno's baked too? I think this joint is almost like a glamorized Quiznos. Tho good, it just tasted gimmicky with the baked option.

This is a great first meal of the day, to energize you for the casinos, or cure your hangover from the night before. To order, line up, order your meal, continue in line to pay and order a drink. 

If you arrive at peak lunch time, expect a crowd. However, for the amount of traffic, they are extremely efficient. If you're in a group, have one person scout out a table, because the seats are taken quickly. 

To eat, the sandwiches are good, but the prices are ever better: five dollars for a medium-sized sandwich. There are also wraps, salads, and soups. Although I did not try a wrap or a salad, i can say that the Veggie sandwich was delicious, and that the ""Vegetable"" and ""Cheddar and Broccoli"" soups are so thick, that they no longer taste like a healthy option. All of the meals, including soups, are wrapped expertly, and labeled, for easy take-away. 

Pro Tip: While you're at Earl of Sandwich, order coffees, and sit playing Penny Slots, while watching tv. Beware of the annoying Wheel of Fortune Countdown ""5..4...3...2...1"" at one of the surrounding machines.

The bread was cruchy and soft at the same time, and I thought that was definitely the highlight of the meal. The BBQ sause was entirely way too salty. They were kind of skimpy on the chicken.

After over 500+ reviews, I'm not going to be adding anything new or groundbreaking about this place, but because I went twice in the two days I was in Vegas, I felt I had to write a review.

Vegas has tons of great places to eat, ranging from $1.99 breakfasts to meals that can go into the hundreds at high-end places, and usually, you get what you pay for. But not at Earl.

For $5.99 you can choose from their selections of hot sandwiches (don't even THINK about going for a wrap or a salad) because that's what they're known for. I got the holiday sandwich (roasted turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, seasoned aoli, and gravy) and it was simply awesome. The bf liked it better than his original (roast beef,cheddar, horseradish sauce). The bread they use is different than any I've had before, almost the consistency of a biscuit, but perfect for their sandwiches.

If you go back again in less than 24 hours, you know the place is awesome, and that's what we did. We went back right before we flew out, and thankfully they have fast service, that we made it to our flight in time. Totally worth it. I had the caribbean jerk chicken this time, which was good, but tasted nothing like jerk chicken. Still a great sandwich though.

One of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.

Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.

Don't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.

I ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.

I had the chipotle chicken sandwich with avocado and my boyfriend had the club. Both were really decent.

I love The Full Montagu because of their amazing roast beef. It's tender, ultra moist, and just tasted like it was meant to exist in a perfect universe. 

The Earl's Club was good, but I felt like the saltiness of the bacon was a little off with their ""Sandwich Sauce"" (which looked like thousand island salad dressing).

The Original 1762 is a jackpot sandwich of their stellar roast beef, cheese, and creamy horseradish sauce: A rich gooey orgasm.

Tuna Melt: Let's be honest, fat = flavor, and this sandwich is a saucy mayonnaise tuna-bomb.

Hawaiian BBQ is great for those who love things like Hawaiian pizza, but in sandwich form. The science behind the sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the ham has never failed anyone.

The Caprese is something I personally hold dear to my heart, that combination of ingredients is what I'm all about. Sadly, I can't recall any presence of the tomato. Considering this cost the same as all the other sandwiches and has zero meat, I'd think twice about ordering it again.

Lastly, but definitely not least, the Best BLT sandwich is without any debate THE BEST BLT SANDWICH I HAVE EVER EATEN. My cousin Bryan V. has spoken of it fondly, but now I know what he's talking about. It's just a savory kingdom of bacon cooled by tomatoes and brought to life by the richness of the mayonnaise.

Another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. I find myself constantly having to repeat my Order cause it seems like they don't pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and I notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready!

Another pro is the efficiency of ordering, grabbing what you want, then paying--similar to a cafeteria but upgraded because the sandwiches are just so damn good. The actual content of the sandwiches is nothing innovating, but the bread is really delicious. The perfect combination of crispy and bready-ness without being overpowering over the entire sandwich as a whole. Really filling especially for the price. I've tried the original and the All American and both were delicous. I've also tried their desserts and definitely think it's worth the extra $2 if you have a sweet tooth post-sandwich. Overall, I give Earl of Sandwiches a 4 for being delicious and also inexpensive. The only downside is it is located on the Strip within Planet Hollywood and that can be annoying to get to if you're a local (which I am). Still delicious though :).",0,0,0

Our friend Danny suggested to go to this place because he said they had the best sandwiches. We were all a little iffy about this place because Danny wasn't someone you would take suggestions from, but we tried it anyway because we were starving. 

Their hot sandwiches were $5.99, which isn't too bad. It seemed as though everyone got The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce. It was DELICIOUS!!! Probably one of the BEST hot sandwiches I've ever had. I also had their sea salt and vinegar kettle chips and they were pretty good too. My friend Amanda got their Tomato Soup and she said it was yummy as well. I heard nothing but greatness from this place.

It was soooo good, that we came back later after clubbing because they're open 24\/7 and close to where we stayed (Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers). 

I would definitely recommend coming here for your late night\/early morning food cravings instead of McDonalds or whatever place is open past midnight. I would even suggest coming here for lunch. I wish they had a closer location to Orange County because I would go here a lot if they did, but the closest is the one in Vegas.

I thought at first that the samich might be overloaded because everyone who eats it is in a post-club, post-long-night-of-drinking state, so I saved half of my sandwich for consumption later.  Although a little cold, it was still EXTREMELY good!  I loved my samich, every last bite of it.

So if you're on the strip hitting this place up, post-club would be the worst time in the sense of how long the lines are, but hey, when you're hungry you're hungry, right?  But even then, the line moves quite quickly and we didn't have to wait too long.

Now at the time (and amazingly for me), I had NO clue that this place had 4000+ reviews, nor did I know that so many of my Yelp buddies had visited, with mixed results. I was purely driven in by the lure of sandwiches.

I ordered a turkey club, a fruit cup, and a fountain soda. The price was OK for Vegas (and bear in mind I live in the Bay Area, so I'm used to high prices). 

Guess what? I LOVED my sandwich. I didn't eat it all right away -- I stuck some in the fridge, when I got back to my room. I ate the rest later and I STILL loved my sandwich. Bread was nice and toasty, fillings were fresh and flavorful. Not too thin, not too thick. Just right.

The fruit cup was expensive, but the fruit was good quality. Not mushy. Tasted pretty fresh.

The fountain soda was a little disappointing (kind of flat).

Don't let the line intimidate you though.. It moves quickly.

The prices are Vegas-affordable. $7-ish to $8-ish for a sandwich.. I say it's worth it rather than spending on an junk food chain.

My ultimate faves are the:

*Full Montagu -Roasted beef and turkey, swish and cheddar cheesem tomato and mustard sauce. ---i mean.. it sounds so freaking simple but trust me.. They have this touch. Their bread is pressed perfectly and the meats are great.. no after taste whatsoever. It's Bomb.

*The Italian - Another simple staple known at every sandwich place.. I tried this last time coz i told myself I have to get something else other than the Full Montagu or the Reuben... I liked it.... Yummmmmy

*Reuben - ooooh i just love patrami and saurkraut.

*Chicken Tortilla Soup - i have no idea why we got this on a perfectly hot day; but it felt great. total hangover cure.

*Chocolate Brownie: Eh. Mine is better. I like how it's not too sweet. But i wish it were more moist. I swear their pastries toward the cashier are flirts. 

I overheard this one chick behind us at the line speaking highly of their Pasta Salad.. Too bad they didn't have it when we were there...

But i've tried their Potato Salad in the past even if i hate mayo coated things; and it was pretty good....

However this was one of the times I had to add dijon mustard just to take away the somewhat blandness of the product. It pains me to say this but even a sandwich from Subway was better than this one.

2) Hawaiian BBQ: Better than the Earls Club, IMO. Between the melted cheese, meat, pineapple & BBQ sauce, this one's a winner. Would definitely order this one again.

This place is great to try at least once based on all the talk. Sandwich is the perfect size when you have chips, salad, etc. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere but it was convenient due to staying @ PH.

Looking at the brick of a sandwich, my first thought was, ""I hope it's not greasy as it looks because I'm about to yak my guts out right now."" And to my surprise, it was actually very light and exactly what I needed in the wee hours of the morning! The bread is amazing, and both the Caribbean Jerk and Hawaiian BBQ were great sandwiches. The sauces weren't overpowering and I didn't get a greasy residue all over my mouth that I usually end up with from panini-like toasted sandwiches.

The holiday turkey is probably one of my favorite sandwiches ever. I love all the ingredients that make up the sandwich: turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry! Thanksgiving in a sandwich. Yummm! 

Earl's also offer plenty of other snacks: wraps, soups, salads, chips, drinks, etc.. but all you really need is a sandwich and a complimentary cocktail from the casino, and you're all good!

Oh Earl, creator of the Sandwich...let me start off by saying, I do enjoy a really good sandwich so thank you for the original idea. 

I've heard from multiple friends and family members about the whole ""Earl of Sandwich"" hype but I never really had it high on my ""Must Try Now List"" because there are so many other good eats options in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, I'm always down for a yummy sammy but I have many other Go-To food options that I would rather have first before devouring a sandwich. 

My girlfriend and I were were knocking back quite a few alcoholic drinks while shopping around at The Miracle Mile Shops (located in Planet Hollywood). So when we finally made our complete round from the shops, we found ourselves feeling a bit hungry from consuming all the drinks we had. We had a couple options to choose from but Earl of Sandwich had the shortest wait line and that alone helped us decide that a sandwich would be for us. Earl of Sandwich is located where the Miracle Mile and Casino entrance meets. They have indoor tables available if you decide to eat your sandwich on the spot. 

Customer service is kinda dry. Maybe because they help thousands of semi-buzzed people a day, you would expect a little bit more life but no, the team members here are rather dry. 

So you start your journey with placing your order with a team member at the first register. From there you get a vibrating pager and a receipt displaying your order. They don't ring you up just yet, because as you walk through you are able to grab cold pasta salads, chips, drinks and desserts to add to your order. The second register is where you finalize your order and pay. We waited probably about 10 minutes until our sandwich order was ready.

Here is what we ordered:

1. The Original Earl
2. Chicken Chipotle, Bacon and Avocado
3. Mac n' Cheese

The bread made in house, which feels like a soft version of a ciabatta. It's soft enough to bite into without hurting the roof of your mouth. All in all I'm going to rate the sandwiches as one. 
I've had better sandwiches, and to be honest these sandwiches are just OKAY, nothing too special. The Mac was pretty good, but again t wasn't the best Mac I've ever had. I think people rave about these sandwiches and say these are amazing because they are ""hammered"" at the time when they have it and anything will sound amazing once you're at that point because you're already drunk. 

Here is my final verdict: I don't think these are the most amazing sandwiches in the world, and I don't think the hype should be where it's at today. 
If you're hungry and need food then yes this place is for you, but they are slightly over priced and need more ingredients within the sandwich.
If I'm desperate and need food, then yeah I would eat at Earl's again... But Earl's won't receive a regular visit from me every time I'm in Vegas.",21,11,14

Taking the recommendations from other yelpers, we ordered the Full Montagu, the Caprese, a broccoli and cheddar soup, and an ice cream sandwich made with Ghiradelli chocolate.

Everything was amazing. The roast beef was moist and complemented the turkey in the Montagu. The bread was nicely toasted, giving a nice satisfying crunch. The Caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. Next time I'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; I like my cheese gooey.

The broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. And of course, how can you go wrong with Ghiradelli?

Amazing!! Now I'm curious to see how it would've tasted if they used California Sourdough's sourdough bread... *drools*

I couldn't help it. We came back the 3rd time this week and why not? At $6 a sandwich and open 24 hours its probably the cheapest good eats on the strip! Here's what we've sampled so far in my preferred order.

1. Full Montagu - just perfect
2. Caprese - would order it extra melty next time
3. Holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm Thanksgiving in my mouth
4. Original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish
5. Italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at me

Brownie creme sandwiches are like giant brownie Oreos. Must have.

- Chipotle Chicken Avocado (Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce) is on point. You really can't go wrong with this.

- Holiday Turkey (Turkey, corn bread stuffing, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise) was good, but seemed to be lacking something. If I order again I'd probably ask for some red onions on it.",1,0,0

It is open 24 hours, but I don't know if this is good drunkard food, what with all the melted cheese and stuff....
although there might be long line, the wait is not that bad and it moves fairly quickly!

What we had:
-potato salad in a cup: over priced (it is vegas) and not worth it
-bag of chips: standard
-loaded potato soup: I don't really know why i got soup in vegas, but I did, and it wasn't that great
-Montague: basically hella meat turkey staked on roast beef and the usual toppings: swiss cheese, tomato onion lettuce, etc this sandwich was very flavorful...beef plus turkey makes for a savory taste. 
-All American: this is the sandwich i HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying! turkey with cheese, lettuce tomato onions and the one ingredient that makes this sandwich so succulent is the cranberry jam! every time i bit into this sandwich it was like fireworks, like the scene from ratatouille where he envisions fireworks! yea like that!

and a frozen lemonade: basically lemonade blended with ice! pretty good!

Surprisingly the sandwiches were 5.99, a pretty decent price that you will find in vegas. 

So get in line and try this place!",0,0,0

The sandwiches are variations on toasted ones with all varieites. My fave? The tuna melt. Absolute magic. (Have also had the Earl of montagu one which was beef, horseradish and cheese and was passable.)

It had no avocado but had cranberries and two types of cheeses which were in chunks in the salad (I actually kinda like the cheesy chunks).  It hit the spot and was good.

My friend had the Cobb salad in a wrap which she also enjoyed.

I got the jerk chicken sandwich and not only was the sandwich small, and I mean really, really small, but there was hardly any chicken and although tender, it was not jerk. I also got chicken noodle soup and for $3.49 the tiny little container was a total ripoff. Plus, the soup was bland bland bland. It was by far the worst chicken soup I have ever had. I left no less hungry than when I arrived. 

The wife opted for oatmeal, and it was instant from a package. The only saving grace was the banana nut muffin, which appeared to be homemade.

The entire ordering process is chaotic and confusing. You can order some things at the order station but most of our order had to picked up along the line, which led to massive confusion when it came time to pay, so I ended up with three receipts.

* Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Favorite! Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. This sandwich is very straightforward, but the combination of flavors are awesome! This is my favorite sandwich on the menu. The chicken is moist, avocado is buttery, the chipotle flavor is mild, but it all works very well together! Rated: 5\/5

* Caprese - Simple, yet packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They add a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also top it with a dreamy balsamic glaze. It's definitely a love at first bite situation. This sandwich also paired very well with the creamy tomato soup. Rated: 4\/5

* The Original 1762 - The bare basic. Moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. The roast beef was tender and flavorful. I didn't detect much cheddar and the horseradish sauce flavor was very mild. It's easy on the stomach, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. Rated: 3\/5

* Hawaiian BBQ - Not my favorite. A large piece of chicken breast, BBQ sauce and 2 slices of canned pineapple rings. The construction of the sandwich made it messy; the insides slid around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. The sandwich was overwhelmed by BBQ sauce and canned pineapple flavor, nothing exciting. Great concept, but poorly executed and not memorable. Rated: 1\/5

* Holiday Turkey - Turkey, stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise. The overall flavor fell flat. I didn't taste the holiday flavors that were advertised. Nothing really stood out, so it all just became a bland mush. Rated: 3\/5

* Tomato soup - Yum! Very creamy and comforting. It has a bold tomato cream flavor and I really love the freshly fried croutons, they added amazing texture and flavor to the soup. It's my favorite soup here and always pairs well with all of the sandwiches. Rated: 5\/5

* Broccoli Cheddar - Tastes just like Subway's version. Not too creamy or flavorful, more on the bland and watery side. Rated: 3\/5

* Brownie - $2.29 A classic brownie that's moist, fluffy and tasty. I took two bites and saved the rest for later. It's huge! Rated: 4\/5",4,1,2

Silly me to doubt his judgement. EoS is high-level grub at a reasonable price.  What they get, and what most sandwich places don't get, is the fact that bread matters. You can ruin the flavors and combinations on a sandwich by using bread thats tasteless or tough. The bread at Earls, though, is awesome. Strong enough to hold its contents, but not too chewy. 

My family ended up splitting six sandwiches for lunch, all of which were great but the Tuna Melt in particular was outstanding.

Awesome sandwich joint open late with a self-proclaimed ""world famous"" tagline that lives up to their hype!

Environment:
This place was in one of the casinos so the environment is... well it's Vegas, what else do you want? They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn't that hard to find seating.

Service:
Mostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn't much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn't really matter here.

Food:
Amazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie at Capriotti's of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!

The name comes from the apocryphal tale about the Earl of Sandwich (an actual position of nobility in the UK).  It was rumored that the Earl was gambling late into the night and in order to eat his meals at the table asked the chef to put the meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread. Voila, the sandwich is born.  Wikipedia doesn't mention this story and other sources on the subject say it's probably not true.

Now you know why this place is called the Earl of Sandwich and why it's fitting that it's in a casino. 

The lines for lunch on Saturday afternoon tend to be long, but it's worth it.  All of the sandwiches, wraps, and salads were $5.99.  I also had a coffee that brought my total with tax to $8.50 or so.  I ordered the Montagu, which had roast beef in it.  The roast beef was much better than I would expect from a sandwich shop -- it was very juicy and was actual slices from a roast and not the typical deli slices (which has the potential to be chopped and formed odds and ends from the butcher).  

The sandwich is smaller compared with with a Subway or Quizno's sub, but the quality is infinitely better.

If you're looking for a cheap lunch (or late night bite since it's open 24-hours) I'd recommend the Earl of Sandwich.  It's at the entrance of the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood, so you can make a quick entrance\/getaway if you don't feel like getting sucked into a mall or casino.",2,1,1

True, there was a long line just to get your order in, but they're like Portos Bakery - huge line, but fast turnover. Not 3 minutes after I placed my order, I got my sandwich.

My buddy and I split a Jamaican Jerk and a Thanksgiving Turkey sandwich. The bread is pretty ridiculously good. It's toasted and crispy on the outer layer, while soft and cushy in the middle.. like pillows for my teeth and tongue to enjoy. 

The Jamaican Jerk had a slight sourness to it with the peppercinnis, but was very flavorful [especially with the bacon]. The Turkey sandwich had stuffing, cranberry sauce, and turkey. I wish this sandwich were piping hot, because that would have propelled this to a perfect sandwich. Alas, it was not piping hot, and alas, it is not a perfect sandwich. But a pretty darned good one still.

Make sure you have someone in your party sit down and reserve a table while you go and stand in line to order. We did that and was guaranteed seating.

The perk of this place being open 24\/7 is quite amazeballs. A quality and substantial offering at all hours of the day can't really be topped. They don't go buckwild crazy and stuff your sandwich to the max, but they certainly aren't shy with how much they give you either.

I wish I could go back and have another sandwich right now, but for sure the next time I'm having the munchies after the clubs in Vegas, I will be going to Earl's because it's open 24 hours! woohoo! Kinda wish I had read the reviews on what to order first, but I just went with what I was feeling at the moment, which was something not too crazy salty\/heavy and I stuck with the Earl Club. Loved it! Your basic club sandwich, but with a chipotle-y sauce and bread that's so soft, warm, yet slightly crunchy that it makes me want to cry. Their bread is amazing! I don't know how they do it, but it reminds me of Mendocino Farm's bread where it looks like the roof of your mouth is going to get some torture scraping against the tops of the bread (which I hate!!), but noooo....surprisingly it's super soft and good!

I also ordered the tomato soup, which I think might have been perfect for sharing because after half a sandwich, finishing the soup wasn't that easy--especially since it's hearty, creamy, and has crunchy bread croutons in it. I'm not usually a tomato soup person, but this really hit the spot.

Also thumbs up on the prices. Not gonna break your bank for being a major hot spot in Vegas. Love it!",3,3,2

If you have sandwich in your name you better not disappoint.  I've been to multiple locations and also been to this one in Planet Hollywood a bunch of times. 

Once you get to the register you only place your food order in with the team member.  You then get your buzzer and slide down to the next register where you actually pay for any food items or drinks that you have decided to buy.

This trip I got The Earl's Club and The Full Montagu.  When you order your sandwich you get the choice of white or wheat bread.  What they do a great job of since these are two hot sandwiches, is that the bread is toasted so it gives it that extra bite to the food. It also allows all the flavors of the sandwich components to stay together.  

The Earl Grey Lemonade at the beverage bar is amazing! It's like their rendition of an arnold palmer with earl grey tea.  Where have you been all my life?  I must have missed this on previous visits but now I know I can't skip this.  It's not overly sweet where you have regret afterwards but you can taste the earl grey tea as well as the lemonade playing off one another.",3,0,1

It's located inside of Planet Hollywood so it is not that easy to get to. There is almost ALWAYS a line from what I hear, especially around 2am-4am after the clubs. The place is clean, well lit and there are about 10-12 different sandwiches. Our group tried the Montagu and Italian sandwiches along with the soup. They also offer different salads and desserts. Everything they had displayed looked wonderful. The prep time for the sandwiches was short and everything came out piping hot. The anticipation was killing me. With my first bite, I was deeply in love. I had to sit back in my chair and contain myself. I really needed to take my time with this sandwich! The Italian was so tasty and delicious. The sandwich is soft, not soggy... with italian dressing. I normally cannot finish a full sandwich but I sure finished this one! The Montagu was great as well but the winner is the Italian!!! I also tried the Chicken soup which was good, the Cheese soup not so great. I am in love. Too bad long distance relationships don't work because I live like 4 hours away.

All weekend long during our last trip, Jeffrey insisted that this was the mecca of sandwiches, the end-all be-all of clubs, the epitome of deli meat & cheese nirvana.  We ordered, we sat, we ate, and well, let's just say, ""NBD.""

J got the club, C got the tuna, D got the BLT & I got the original.  The club was okay, but I'm not big on those anyway.  The BLT had a decent amount of bacon in it, and was nice & crunchy.  The original was okay, but the meat was too dry for my taste.  I'm not big on the sauce, so I opted for just a little mayo, but that didn't quite cut it.  However, the cheese is pretty yummy & it melts just right.  Honestly, the best of our choices was the tuna.  It was pretty freaking yummy.

Price is what you'd expect to pay for something located in the middle of a shopping center in LV.  So be it.  Oh, but you'd have to walk the daytona 500 from parking or from the street, so don't bother making the trip if you're not gonna do something else within close proximity.

I could give the tuna alone 5-stars, but seating's limited, especially when they're busy.  Service isn't really anything, they just take your order & buzz you when it's ready.  Oh, but our cashier did make some jokes, so that's always a plus.

This place is NOT overrated, it's just that awesome. I've had EoS before in Anaheim by Disneyland, it was OK. My hubs and I were craving a midnight snack though while in vegas so we walked over from Cosmo (super quick and easy!) and the line was non existent. We got the roast beef sandwich with tomato soup. Aside from the sandwich that's pretty amazing the TOMATO SOUP!! It has these humongous croutons that were crunchy but soaking up the creamy salty tomato soup and it was amazing. My only regret from this trip is that I didn't get more of that soup, damn free buffet at wicked spoon.

Anyway, it's cafeteria style you order, then they make you walk through the line of temptation with sides and drinks and dessert, then allow you to pay. Would come back here, a very cheap good eats place in vegas!",7,5,6

The sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on Yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  

We got:

Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.

The Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! 

This place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!",14,7,12

Located inside Planet Hollywood's shopping mall, I wasn't surprised to see a long line, but it moved quickly. The first thing I notice was the prepacked sandwich rolls stacked up in the prep area.

For $5.99 it's not a bad price in Vegas! I grabbed a small side of potato salad and a brownie cream sandwich for dessert. The potato salad was good, but nothing amazing. The Brownie sandwich ($2.49) will add an inch to your waist just looking at it. It was good if you like sinfully rich desserts, but I'd recommend splitting it with a few people.

I don't necessarily understand what the hype is about surrounding these sandwiches. But I'm thinking one of the main reasons its so popular is because of the lack of places to eat on the Strip that don't break the bank. I appreciate the variety of flavors and influences on top of the more traditional sandwiches on the menu. Plus I like the idea of healthy options available @ 3am. However!

The service was still as good. I tried the Earl signature sandwich, the bread was soft, meat was fresh and not too salty.

We had the Holiday Turkey, a Earl Club and a cup of Clam chowder! They were all banging. Starting with the Holiday Turkey, the bread was hot, soft and kinda buttery and it was stuffed with a whole holiday turkey meal, from cranberry jelly to the cornmeal stuffing. Delish! The Earl Club was just as fantastic with the same delicious bread and great crispy bacon, its what a club sandwich should be like.

On my last visit to Vegas, we made treks to Earl of Sandwich after clubbing at TAO and Marquee on two different nights. True, I was drunk off my ass both times, and so that could have greatly influenced my love for each bite of my sandwich. But, honestly, my measure of Earl's greatness is that I actually remember each delicious bite in what was otherwise a night of blurry flashbacks. I can still taste my Tuna Melt sandwich, even to this day, and it brings back such fond memories of a time when life was truly great.

Additionally, I brought back a Caribbean Jerk Chicken back to my hotel room, passing out before I could touch it. I woke up the next morning, hungover and hating life -- the last thing I could think about was food. However, I took one bite of that cold Caribbean Jerk Chicken that was sitting out for over 8 hours in the hotel room and even THAT was damn delicious. 

On my third visit (in the same weekend to Earl's), I got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich again since I wanted to try it how it was intended (hot and crispy). It went amazingly well with my bowl of Tomato Bisque.

I'm the type of person who strives to try new places all of the time. If I'm in Vegas for 2 days, then I will make it a mission to try a new place every meal. I very rarely ever go back to the same place twice in the same week, let alone the same 2 days.

True taste test was this weekend when I bought the sandwich for early dinner on Saturday, and had some leftover on Sunday morning. Our hotel didn't have a fridge nor microwave, so my leftover was just sitting out overnight. And it was still SO GOOD. Never had that happen with any other sandwich.

Pros: 
-6.50 a steaming hot sandwich after tax and it located right on the strip.
-The service is speedy, all the ingredients taste fresh
-Way better than Quizno's, Subways and Capriotti's combined.  Quiznos and subway gives way too little meat and Capriotti's is a bit more expensive and takes longer to make.  Earls is hot, fresh and has a good amount of meat in them.  :)

This is one of the best sandwich place ever because everything tastes so fresh and great!  I love the fact that they have something for everyone here and what makes it so awesome is that it's cheap compared to all the other places around the Strip.  

The last time I went I had to wait for an hour to get my sandwich because of the long lines.  However, my friends and I went around 2-3 pm on a Saturday this past weekend and we got our food fairly quickly.  

I had originally asked for the Tomato soup to go with my sandwich, but they gave me loaded potato instead.  I love soups and the loaded potato soup was really good, not too creamy, and it had this comfort feeling when I was devouring it.  Since this was my second time, I had the Montague again, it just hits the spot when you're hungry.

The warm bread, turkey, cheese (Swiss and cheddar), lettuce and tomato were all fresh and complemented each other perfectly. The ""mustard sauce"" that comes on the sandwich seemed a little too sweet (perhaps honey mustard) so I added a bit of dijon from the table and it added the right amount of kick. I'm not usually one to eat my entire meal in one sitting but it was so tasty that I couldn't put it down (plus, my room didn't have a fridge so I didn't have much choice...no way I was throwing this out!). 

At $6.50, the price was very reasonable, especially for a spot on the Strip in Vegas. I added a bag of chips to my order for $1.25 (also a great price!.

Went in with high expections...didn't disappoint. About 7 bucks (2016) will score you a mid-sized fresh-n-warm sandwich. Tremendous bang-for-the-buck, but not mind blowing. I had 3 half sandwiches, for the sake of research, not because I'm a fatty. Here's what you need to know:

Chipotle Chicken Avocado - 4.0\/5

More chipotle sauce would've made it a 4.5. Be sure to ask for extra (trust me). Dryness is a theme at Earl, beware. Liked that the chicken wasn't processed. Avocado was excellent.

Italian - 3.5\/5 

A little salty but very tasty. Some vegetables would have made it a 4. Almost tastes like a gourmet pizza because the meats mimic a pepperoni flavor, it has mozzarella, and it's served warm.

Full Montagu - 3.5\/5

Pretty good, but kind of a typical processed meat sandwich. Also suffered from dryness. Required more mustard.

Pro tip: if you're into pepperoncini, ask for a side of it. It's free and adds another dimension of flavor.

My personal favorites are the Full Montagu and the Earl's Club. We ended up ordering extra sandwiches for our way back home on our trip there this past weekend, so lucky for me I have an Earl's Club waiting for me at home for lunch!",0,0,0

They have a pretty big menu, ranging from sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and even desserts! The prices are pretty good too! About $6 for a hot sandwich!

All of the sandwiches looked and sounded really delicious - well, being hungover and starving, anything sounds good to be honest. Nonetheless, I was torn between The Earl's Club - roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged Swiss cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and sandwich sauce - and The Full Montagu - freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and their savory mustard sauce. My friends, who have been here in the past, told me that I should just get both, eat half of each sandwich and save it for the ride back, so I ended up with both. My friend alone, bought 4 different sandwiches for herself, so I didn't feel that bad for buying two.

No lie, The Full Montagu was amazingggggggg. So fresh! It was the best thing to cure my hangover. Even so, I couldn't even finish the quarter of it. I didn't eat The Earl's Club until the next day, even so, it STILL tasted pretty good. 

The only downside is that this place seems to always be crowded. We waited about 20 minutes before we could order. Twenty minutes doesn't seem long, but when you're starving, it seems like foreverrrrrr. I wouldn't want to wait in this line at 4 in the morning after ending my night at the clubs.

3) Don't call the number on those fliers people hand out to you on the strip. You'll just end up marrying a hooker. That's worse than a stripper if you're wondering.

So as I wanted to adhere to this rule system, my BF & I paid a visit to the Earl of Sandwich before going out for drinks and gambling. For $5.99 these sandwiches are a crazy good deal! I had the roast beef w\/ horseradish and I loved how the bread is nicely toasted. I highly recommend if you're looking to get a quick bite.

Tiffany: ""Whaaaaa?! LET'S GO TO VEGAS!""

Upon hearing about this highly raved hot sandwich place called ""Earl of Sandwich"", which floods my facebook news feed statuses and pictures on a biweekly basis, the thought of feeling deprived and naive to what great concoctions this joint produced bothered me. How could this place been unbeknownst to me after several Vegas trips over the course of two years?! Obviously- I have been living under a rock.

Fresh, piping hot sandwiches that are wrapped in a gold foil, where the unwrapping of this decadent sandwich parallels to the experience of unwrapping a Wonka bar, as you await to see if you may be the lucky one to claim the golden ticket. Except in this case, everyone is a winner since each shiny wrapped golden foiled item will behold an experience where each unfolding of the wrap heightens your excitement to devour this melt in your mouth goodness. Win win! 

How much did I like this place? Maybe a little too much to the extent where I actually went two days in a row (aka. the length of my trip); however, this granted me the opportunity to try not one or two different sandwiches, but THREE! TRES! Read this clearly. Yes I HEIFER!!! Moooo.

I wish I could pick one, but all three sandwiches were divine! The Earl's Club, a sandwich comprised of thinly sliced roasted turkey that tastes as if it were fresh out of the deli, layered with crispy pieces of Smoked Bacon goodness, Aged Swiss that oozes and clings to the bread and your mouth  for some good cheese action, offset with some refreshing pieces of Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes amongst a slathering of Good Burger like secret sauce. Oooo willy. I can only imagine how delicious it would be to consume this right now at 8:30am. 

Cannonballs! So I'm a meat girl and I distinctively remembering a huge hankering for some meat during my last night in sin city. What better way to satisfy this craving with a sandwich full of meatballs cushioned with rich, saucy marinara sauce with melted mozzarella cheese & Parmesan?! Dudes and Dudettes- this hit THE spot. 

Now, even though all three sandwiches were beyond delicious, there was one that distinctively stands out. The tantalizing, TUNA MELT!  Perhaps it was the fact that there was no lack of oozing aged Swiss or because the Albacore tuna salad was beyond rich and divine, but the combination of the two simply highlighted this standard diner special to the point beyond oo so ump dittily scrumptious, giving me a lasting euphoria of tuna melt heaven for several hours. 

I swear. This place is the go-to spot for a quick lunch or for a late night post clubbing snack since the place is open 24\/7. If you haven't tried this place yet, please do yourself a favor and throw that rock off your back and stampede your way to Earls'  because I'm ever so glad that I did.",2,2,4

I tried the club, full monague, and tuna melt. I must say my favorite was the tuna melt. It doesn't come with anything but the melted cheese and tuna goodness on a toasty bread bun, but you can ask them to add lettuce and tomato for free! 

I loved their soups too. Tomato bisque and broccoli cheddar were both delicious. I think over our weekend in Vegas, for every meal and late night snack, our group of 16 always had someone that went to Earl's. It's quick, cheap, and good! It's open 24 hours too.

I could tell this place was happening when I saw the long line but it moved quite quickly. I ended up ordering, ""Italian - Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato."" 

 When I ordered they sent me over to another cashier area to pay then they gave me a buzzer to let me know when my sandwich was ready.  I thought why no other sandwich place does this. It makes sense if you think of it since people get confused what the hell they order half the time.  My wait was about 5-10 minutes which was not bad.  After biting into my sandwich and all the juices oozing out, this was a perfectly toasted and tasting sandwich. All the meat and cheese were melted just right.

Earls Club ( roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss, letuce tomato sandwich sauce )= so fresh! very very flavorful sandwich that can't disappoint!

Full Montagu (roasted beef turkey swiss and cheddar letuce earl mustard)= My little bro really liked this sandwich. He just scarfed it down = sign of a good time!

Notes: 
* veggie sandwich is a no no. not enough veggies in that sandwich to keep you full. I felt like I was just ingesting carbs as opposed to vegetables AND carbs. 
* don't expect a large sandwich! the sandwich sizes actually run kind of small. yes you are paying for good flavor, but you're also paying for the brand itself.

The menu looked awsome and the place was packed.  I had read some reviews on the place and thought it was worth a shot.

I ordered the Chipotle Chickent Sandwhich.  Chicken breast pieces sandwiched between a cibotta roll with bacon, avacado and chipotle sauce.  I ordered extra sauce on the side and was sure glad I did because it was so good.  The sandwich was amazing.  I absolutely loved it except that half the sandwich had only a couple little pieces of chicken-a little lopsided I guess.  I hate when that happens.  My boyfriend got the Caribbean Chicken sandwich and it was really good too.  Too many red\/green peppers for me but had great flavor and he thought it was great.

We did share the tomato soup which came with the croutons- in it.  Soggy!  Next time I will for sure ask for those on the side.  Soup was pretty good too.

Earl of Sandwich is my Vegas comfort food place of choice. I can always depend on them for a great sandwich and soup after a long night of clubbing. Or, in this case, after drinking too much free champagne at a pool party.

Since I don't really remember what everyone else got (there were about 14 of us) I'll just say that my Earl's Club with avocado and Tomato Soup was awesome. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the avocado was actual avocado pieces, not avocado mush. My sandwich was also perfectly toasted and had just the right amount of mayo. The tomato soup was also a nice complement to my entire meal.

The only downside was that the coffee from one of the dispensers was cold. However, the other dispenser was still pretty warm, so Cam and I drank from that one. I was just really craving some coffee.",0,0,1

My friend got the original full Montague, whereas I decided to be a little different and got the Italian sandwich. Pretty damn good if I must say so myself. 
The bread on both sandwiches were beautifully toasted and each sandwich was the perfect size to wrap your lips around and take bite after bite after bite. Not too greasy and not too filling. Twas a quite amazing sandwich.

My only problem with this place is the location and the wait (at least a 30 minute wait). So, if you're near Planet Hollywood, by all means, please please try this place. BUT, if you're not ... just be prepared for the trek. And sometimes, they run out of the full Montague. So, get there before they run out! A definite place to try if you're in a Vegas.",3,1,1

I ordered the The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce) and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Can't go wrong with that combo. SO delicious. Hot and toasted sub sandwich with juicy flavors that are never forgotten. 

The day before, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, I didn't like it at all. I was expecting more of a chicken noodle soup with crispy tortilla strips but I got what resembled chili. 

The reason I sadly put 4 stars is because in the sandwich, the last bite had a black rubbery part of the meat (which was probably the skin or something odd) and that was pretty gross. But that never has happened to me and I've had Earl's for years.

All the sandwiches are delicious and though the line may be long, it moves pretty quickly. Plus you're in Vegas at the shops, so there are tons of things you can do while waiting for your food, though it doesn't take long at all.

Some of my faves:
- Chipotle Chicken Avocado: tender chicken, fresh avocado and tangy\/mild chipotle sauce
- Caribbean Jerk: Too drunk to remember... but it was gooooood
- Holiday Turkey: One of the specials you can only get around the holiday season I believe. It has thin-sliced turkey, cranberry sauce and gravy! OMG.

So we decided to walk down to Planet Hollywood at 10:30pm toward Earl's which was open 24 hours but was like 7 hotels down (Encore-Wynn-Venetian-A bunch of ones I forgot\/Flamingo\/Imperial Palace) and finally got there, and we were like ""this BETTER be good.""  
The sandwiches were on the smaller side, but a decent amount, and we tried the Pot roast and the turkey.  They were toasted and fresh, and the turkey had fresh ingredients and a crisp flavor with tomato\/lettuce\/cheese and some tangy sauce.  I personally really liked the pot roast, which was very juicy and tender, while the juices did not sog up the crisp and chewy bread.  We discussed that it just takes some fresh ingredients, good bread, and good meat to make a good sandwich; Earl of Sandwich definitely got it right.   

Being that this place is not all that pricey (if you were really hungry you could order 2 x $5.99 sandwiches for $12 total, which is cheap compared to some other places in Vegas).  The ""Loaded Potato"" soup is really good too, reminded us of creamy clam chowder with potatoes instead of clams.",1,0,0

First sandwich on my mind was the Caribbean Jerk and I'm always inclined to get sandwiches that don't have the typical deli meat in it.  I was a little disappointed that the flavor level just wasn't what I was expecting.  It was pretty mild but nothing a little hot sauce can't enhance.

Second sandwich was really a toss up between the Full Montagu and the Tuna Melt.  I love tuna melts but I never order this one because it just seems to lack uniqueness compared to other sandwiches that shops can make. Turns out I loved it here!  I like that the melted swiss was right in the middle of two thick layers of tuna.  It really helped highlight the cheese and bind all of it together.  Tuna was plentiful and not watery.

If I could go back in time, I would get the Full Montagu instead of the Caribbean Jerk.  I do like the bread because it's warm and on the dense side.  I wouldn't call it gourmet like Acme or Tartine but sometimes you just want good, normal bread without all the crunch and holes.",3,0,2

The Full Montagu was the favorite of everyone's. I've had that and also the Thai Wrap on another occasion. The best part of the sandwich is the bread because it was warm and crispy on the inside. However, there isn't much meat and vegetables for that size of bread. Other than that, the sandwich was quite tasty and the bread, as I mentioned, is the best. For the Thai Wrap, I ordered this because I just needed some Asian flavors after going so many days without it. The wrap was fine and nothing special. There was a bit too much sweet chili sauce and not enough peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, and there was a decent amount of filling in the wrap.

The people who work here are super friendly and will kindly answer any questions you may have and offer you suggestions.

Several of tables were dirty. An employee on break was clearly not happy that we were sitting near her in the quieter section and not amongst the bright, teetering post-club groups around the corner. The seat cushions were ripped. Bleh.

Oh, and I'd ordered the Wisconsin Cheese soup without thinking to ask if it was vegetarian (my fault - I should know better with soups), so I was grumpy to open the lid and see all of the little clumps of bacon. (And grumpy because, again, this was my fault, so I didn't feel like I could take it back.) I tried to get my husband to eat it, but he pushed it away after a bite and a half. ""It tastes like Velveeta with bacon bits."" (Now that's the restaurant's fault.)

I found myself wishing that we'd gone to Krung Thai or Peppermill, where their Caprese sandwich leaves me nuzzling my hands for an hour afterward. Mmmmm. Fresh, fresh basil!

And what the heck was this frozen lemonade with the too-small straw that tasted like oversweet mixer with a dash of water?

I looked at the brown-edged, withering flower in the vase on the table and thought, ""The sandwich is good, but I can't go higher than a three. This bread is really chewy and delicious, and it's nice to have a hot Caprese. It's also nice that they have more than one vegetarian sandwich. Maybe a three-and-a-half.""

The next day I found myself wishing for another hot Caprese. Okay, four stars it is. I had to remember to compare this with Subway and Quiznos, not with other late-night options. Four stars for a menu with two hot vegetarian sandwiches on distinctive bread, for pagers that mean you can find a place to sit and relax and wait for your order to be ready, for friendly staff (at least those on-duty), and for being open 24 hours.

Minus a star for dirty tables, for lazy frozen lemonade, for soup that tastes like processed cheese, for a cake-like chocolate-chip cookie of minimal flavour that would be overpriced at half the price, and for charging $6 for a 6"" meatless sandwich that, once you get past the bread, is nothing special.

I'm still craving a sandwich on nice bread, though... which is why it's going to be Schlotzsky's for lunch tomorrow. But the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood and hungry, but not ""sit-down hungry,"" I'll happily get a Caprese to go.",2,1,2

Luckily, we were able to try this place after clubbing at Tao.  Open 24 hours!!  yay!!!  A couple of friends and I had ""breakfast"" or a ""late dinner"" at 4 am. at Earl's and it was still a happening place.  Lots of people ordering food.

I couldn't decide between the full montague or the original so I got both - one for me and one for my hubby.  Then we split both and shared half of each with each other.  The Full montague is with turkey, tomatoes, lettuce, and roast beef, and earl's sauce.  The Original is roast beef with a horseradish sauce and earl's sauce.

I LOVED the original.  I liked it better than the full montague because you can taste the roast beef a lot more and has a tiny hint of horseradish that tantalizes your tastebuds.  yum!

I liked the full montague, too.  but the original is better, in my opinion.  Hubby thought the opposite.  He liked the full montague more than the original.  

Price:  $6 each sandwich.  My friend got the tomato soup,too, and she loved it.  It was only $3.99!

There a lot more choices to choose from.  Whenever I go back to Vegas, I'm definitely  going to come here again and try out their other sandwiches!

3 Stars

Gold, Silver, Bronze medal - Roasted Beef Sandwich

The first time I heard of Earl of Sandwich was when one of my friends was raving about a new sandwich place.  Its so good, blah blah blah.  I was excited to try it.  I first saw Earl of Sandwich at Downtown Disney, but the line was EXTREMELY long.  Like a 25 minute wait at least. 25 minute wait for a sandwich shop?  WOW, now I got even more interested.

I made my way to the Planet Hollywood in Vegas just to try the Earl of Sandwich.  Conclusion........ I am not impressed at all.  I tried 3 different hot sandwiches. The best out of the 3 was the roasted beef with the horseradish sauce.  It was hot and not too shabby, but definitely not 5 stars.

This located was EXTREMELY dirty too.  Unlike all the clean In n Outs you visit, the Earl of Sandwich here had trash all over the floor.  

I am not sure if Earl of Sandwich was over hyped or this location was just bad, but I am not impressed at all.  There are sooo many good things to eat in Vegas, but I will not be adding Earl of Sandwich to my Vegas eats list.

I first discovered Earl of Sandwich when I was at Downtown Disney in Florida a couple years ago and have been a huge fan since. The closest one to me is at Downtown Disney in California so I was excited to hear there was an Earl of Sandwich during my recent Las Vegas trip. 

I'm a huge fan of holiday sandwiches and this sets the bar for future holiday sandwiches I will try. It not only comes with the usual turkey and cranberry sauce but also STUFFING. Now that's what I call a holiday sandwich. I was so disappointed when I didn't see the holiday sandwich on the menu when I was at Earl of Sandwich in California only later discovering it's available year round. I'll never make that mistake again! 

Anyways, I ordered my usual holiday sandwich again and it didn't disappoint! This is a smaller location than the ones I've been to but the sandwiches are just as yummy! I also got a chocolate chip cookie to go with my meal. It was super chocolate-y and chewy.

My friends and I stayed at Planet Hollywood, so access to the sandwiches was as convenient as can be.  Not that convenience is a factor when it comes to these sandwiches.  I would walk the WHOLE strip if I had to, just to get one in my stomach!  

I tried EVERY SINGLE sandwich they had at least once, and the ones I recommend are: The Original, The Earl's Club, The Full Montagu, and my favorite, THE ALL AMERICAN!!!  

The All American had to be one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce & Roma tomatoes.  The way all the flavors mix together when you take a bite is HEAVEN.  It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner in one bite!  

The bread they use is a perfect blend of crispy-toasty-fluffyness that melts in your mouth!  It Doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like other toasted sandwiches I've had, and that's a BIG factor towards enjoying a toasted sandwich!

If you want to learn more, peep this link for a description of each sandwich.  But for MAXIMUM satisfaction, try the ones I suggested!

http:\/\/www.earlofsandwichusa.com\/food\/sandwich\/


Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Late Dinner, and Drunk Super Late Dinner\/Super Early Breakfast are the best times to have one of these sandwiches!

My friends and I even bought some for the road trip home!  Good thing there isn't one in SoCal, cause I'd go broke eating at this place!

SUBWAY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME TO ME.

To me this place is a hyped up Quiznos and I'm not a lover of Quiznos. So let me lay our my reasons for this two star rating... 

I was in during lunch time mid-week so I was prepared for it to be a bit busy but I felt the line more very slow for the number of people ahead of me. The wait for the sandwich was ok but I still felt should have been shorter for the number of people ahead of me. I ordered the Thanksgiving theme turkey sandwich because it was the only sandwich that appealed to me from the menu options. 

The sandwich itself was lack-luster at best for me because I am used to the Capriotti's version of a Thanksgiving sandwich (the Bobbie... Which i love btw). So in order to convey my dismay with this sandwich I will now compare the two!!! My favorite features of the Bobbie are as follows: 1. The gobs of stuffing\/ dressing, 2. The homemade cranberry sauce with real cranberries, 3. The  turkey is shredded turkey meat not lunch meat. Now the Earl of Sandwich version... Mistake #1: THEY USED PROCESSED SANDWICH MEAT, #2: Not a lot of dressing, #3: no cranberry, and #4: they toasted it!!! (So not a fan of toasted sandwiches!!!!)

To my surprise, it was the best tuna melt i have ever had. There wasn't too much cheese that it overpowered the sandwich; i could taste the tuna and it was light and flavorful, which was a new experience for me; and the best part was the bread - delicious, the right texture, and enhanced the greatness of this sandwich overall.

In Vegas, I know I'm gonna spend  and lose a lot of money because i'm a terrible gambler since slot machines are so hypnotizing and i'm the unluckiest person you would ever meet, so this sandwich helped me stay fed in Vegas - its very affordable, especially by Las Vegas standards.

-The Original 1762
-The Full Montague
-Caribbean Jerk Chicken
-Cannonballs!

It was like a sliced prime beef sandwich with the perfect amount of creamy horseradish & cheese. They don't skimp on the meat. Basically, if you like eating prime rib, you'll effing love this sandwich. The bread was good, not too airy. During my 6-night stay, I returned two more times just for the Original*. The other sandwiches were okay. One time I came here before a noon poker tourney and I saw there was no line. I was so excited until I got to the register and was told by the manager that their computers were down. I told her I'd overpay and I don't need change. DONE & DONE!

So we decided to give Earl of Sandwich a chance.

Gotta tell you...ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE. I ordered the Hawaiian Sandwich, which consisted of ham, chicken, pineapple, and barbecue sauce. It was satisfying!! Even though Earl of Sandwich falls into the category of a quick place to eat, it did not have the fast-food quality food. 

I was so happy with my dinner that I convinced my friends to come back a few hours later (around 2AM). The sandwiches at Earl of Sandwich are great for after drinking....believe me.

    I am still drooling over the sandwiches my boyfriend and I had shared. We wanted to get a quick bite to eat and Earl is located at Planet Hollywood. My boyfriend always makes a stop at Earl's every time he's in Vegas. He knows I am a huge food buff, so he shared this excellent sandwich shop with me. That afternoon, Earl's had a special sandwhich, which was a BBQ brisket sandwhich; we ordered that and a Full Montagu. I remember standing in line trying to decide what to order, when I got a glimpse of the bread. I was thinking to myself, ""why is the bread not cooked or brown?"" It's because they toast the bread on both sides. It's so delicious and nothing compares to that light, toasty sandwich. I wish there was an Earl's around LA. I would go there everyday for lunch! The price is about $6 a sandwich which is good for something so tasty. My boyfriend and I shared the 2 sandwiches, so I had a taste of both.

The Full Montagu: Mustard sometimes makes or breaks a sandwich for me, I didn't make it this time, but was alright.

I hope it becomes a permanent staple in their menu! If you're not feeling too hungry at the time, definitely save half a sandwich for a 4am snack and I can assure you it will taste just as amazing then. 

A huge plus is also the price. For under $7 dollars, you will have a very happy tummy, ready to party the night away in Sin City. Plus 1 more point due to the fact that this place is open 24\/7.

I had the Caprese sandwich and my friend got the original. We sat in silence eating for about five minutes and just enjoyed our sandwiches. That is when you know something is good!

The caprese sandwich was the right mix of cheese, tomato and balsamic. It wasn't too much liquid which can happen quite often with this type of sandwich.

The Mac and cheese was amazingly delicious, but I wouldn't say it's the best. I wished it was a bit more crunchy at the top part though because only some parts were crunchy. 
When I saw the chipotle chicken, I was disappointed that the sandwich was small. I'm not a big eater but compared to New York, the price I paid for the sandwich would definitely be bigger than what I got at Earl's. The sandwich as a while was magnificent, but again I wouldn't say it's the best. I felt like there wasn't enough chicken and avocado too.

On the positive side, the bread is super fresh, the ingredients pretty tasty, service is quick and the price is affordable.

On the negative side, the sandwiches are a touch on the small side and service was kinda painful.

The GF and I came here for lunch, specifically to try Earl of Sandwich.  She ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chick and I had the Chipotle Chicken with Avacado and Chicken.  My sandwich was pretty good.  As I said above the bread may have been the best part.  Ingredient-wise you can see they use the same chicken across all their sandwiches and just dress the differently.  The chipotle dressing was nice and added a lot of flavor and the bacon and avocado where lacking a bit and didn't really punch through as much as I hopped.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken came out without any dressing so my GF had to get another, upon the second try it was better.  It didn't really have as much flavor as I was expecting.  Again, it was a solid, even a good sandwich...it just could have been more.

Service was kind of wonky.  You order and one register then pay at another down the line.  The cashier at the end disappears to refill some napkins and disappears for almost 5 minutes.  A line quickly formers behind us and the food orders come in before people could pay.  The ladies running the sandwiches looked dumbfounded because they didn't know what to do.  Finally the cashier comes back, but it was still rather annoying.

I do want to give Earl of Sandwich another try down the road, particularly the one near disneyland.  While it wasn't everything I was expecting, the sandwiches were still of a good quality and an easy pick over Subway, Quiznos, Togos or any other fast food sandwich shop.",3,2,2

And the food? Man I scarfed it down so fast I was almost ready to get another one..but opted to get potato salad instead. The sandwich I got was the tuna melt..minus the cheese, so it was basically a tuna sandwich. The bread was warm,crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only complaint was that they could've been a little more generous with the tuna, but it was no biggie. Oh and that potato salad was  oh so good. The bf got The Original which he actually enjoyed. He said it was a lot better than last time but could've used more au jus.

Actually, the first time I had a sandwich from here, I wasn't actually there. I had just landed in Vegas and went and partied up a bit and went back to my room at the Elara. My partner was hungry and told me that they would be back. I was like what is open at this time of night. Are you gonna catch a cab? Wait, they said. No sooner had I removed my makeup and dressed into the comfy clothes, back they were with the sandwiches. It was still warm. I bit into it and was in heaven. Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas! At the time, I attributed the satisfaction to all day travel and some great drank. Boy, was I wrong.

Couple of days later, the partner wanted to place some bets at the sports book and asked if I wanted to grab some sandwiches to watch the game. I said sure, so I stood in line and got the sandwiches while they placed the bets. When we got settled back in the room, I took a bite of my sandwich and was so wowed! So they are as good when I'm sober AND drunk! That happens rarely, so I was just awed!!

When we finally had to leave Las Vegas for home, we grabbed some sandwiches to eat while we wait for security at the airport. So convenient that this place is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Makes going home a little bit more bearable.

My brothers, friend, and I went for our first lunch in Vegas. After a ridiculously laborious trip from Downtown to Planet Hollywood, we were there. Another few minutes were spent navigating the maze that is PH to the Earl of Sandwich, and alas it was time for lunch!
The line itself was scary, but went by in a flash. A line that could have easily taken 45 minutes took maybe ten. The girl taking our orders was nice, but not much in the way of conversation or greeting. She did, however, keep that line moving.
The sandwich selection was plentiful, but not so much that it was overwhelming. There were a few treats to look at as the line made it's way down the counter to the registers (chips, fruit, drinks, cookies, etc.).
I went with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. It was delicious! My only gripe was that the jerk sauce wasn't as sweet of as spicy as I would have like, but it will not stop me from ordering it again. The bell peppers and banana peppers were excellent!
My brother and my friend each got the Hawaiian and holy crap was it good! Ham, barbeque sauce, and pineapple make this sandwich shine, it was definitely the best of them all.
My other brother got the Full Montagu and it was the least favored. All in all, it was a good sandwich. It had roast beef, turkey, cheddar, swiss, and veggies. Our problem with this one was that it was a typical sandwich. Compared to similar sandwiches from other restaurants, this one is far better but there was nothing about this one that stuck out or made it special like the other sandwiches.

While the majority of the group opted for Pink's hotdogs, which was right outside the Miracle Mile\/PH hotel entrance, a small handful of us decided to grab something slightly lighter by going with sandwiches from Earl (inside PH).  Boy, let me tell ya, NO REGRETS.

The best part of Sandwich connoisseuring is that you get to try out a plethora of tasty breads!  Earl's offers a warm and toasty bread that doesn't flake, but crunches by the bite.  My friend and I had both ordered the signature Earl's Club ( Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) while another fella went with the Veggie sandwich (Feta Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Roasted Red Peppers & Mediterranean Dressing.)  Now, I don't know what the sandwich sauce consists of, but it sure did compliment the ingredients with the crunchy bread.  I'm guessing that the sauce is somewhere along the lines of a zangy mustard, a hint of mayo, and a splash of light vinaigrette, perhaps?

If your tummy can make room for a tasty soup, then I would definitely recommend ordering the tomato soup as well!  I shared a cup with my friend and it was delicious!  Tangy and lightly creamy, served with a handful of crunchy croutons, it was the perfect finish to a beautiful sandwich.

What makes me more sad than realizing that I didn't take a single picture of this masterpiece is finding out that Earl of Sandwich cannot be located in CA.  I guess this calls for more visits to Sin City!",0,0,0

The bread is very good; it was toasted but not too crunchy, and they did a good job making the wheat bread almost up to par as their original (and presumably better) bread alternative.

They didn't skimp with the filling, which I was surprised at given our location (usually touristy places aren't as good or provide less quantities in my experience). The serving portion was just right to keep everyone sated. I tried friend's soup, and it was good. 

The place is a bit cold, so bring a jacket or sweater. But overall, excellent meal with excellent service.",0,0,0

Usually I'd have a larger lunch with a higher price elsewhere, then end up here for a cheap dinner.  I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken, the Earl's Club, and the All American sandwiches. The Caribbean Jerk was easily the best, the others were good but not great, although clearly above the level of most chains.  They are $5.99 each, but not large enough to be a complete meal, so you'll want to get a side.  I usually went with a house salad for $1.79, despite how tempting all the little treats around were, like the triple chocolate brownies or the chocolate banana muffins.  Kinda defeats the purpose of coming here to get a sandwich due to it being healthier than food court options, but I guess they have something for everyone (fruits, yogurt parfait, etc).

While it gets busy, they run a pretty smooth operation with assembly line like efficiency (the layout from where you order, what else you can grab, where you pay, where you pick up, and where all the employees are and what function they serve).  The only thing is once your thing starts vibrating (and by thing, I mean the square coaster\/pager that tells you when your order is ready) it will go on for what seems like an eternity.

This one is in the Miracle Mile and is open 24hrs. It's hard to recommend a good time because it always looked like the line was long. We went Monday morning a little before 10 and amazingly the line was short - maybe 3 people ahead of us. Usually it's wrapped around the corner.

My hubby had the Jerk Chicken and I had the Earl Club. I didn't ask him too many questions because I was too busy stuffin' my face. 

The bread they used was amazing. From the looks of it I thought it would be harder but it wasn't. The bread melts in your mouth and is perfect. If I could order just the fresh bread I would. Delish!

PH was holding a poker event so they cleared out the slots for the card tables and cordoned the table area off, which left a narrow aisle for the line and people passing by.

We came back later when the line died down and the few people standing in line formed the line into the direction of the casino floor, which made sense because it frees up the aisle for people to pass through.  They even left a ""break"" in the line to give space for the people seated at the table to the left of the order takers on the casino floor.  The order taker was super rude when he told everyone to ""FORM THE LINE THE OTHER WAY!!"" And people formed the line back into the narrow aisle.  

While paying for the food at the cashier the two morons at the registers decided to hold up everyone unnecessarily by having non-work related chat amongst each other and laughing while ringing people up.  One of them actually had the change in her hand but didn't hand it to the couple ahead of us until after the guy finished his punchline and both laughed before she handed the change and receipt to the customer.  I think she held the change for 10 seconds.  The transaction probably took 1\/2 minute too long... Imagine you're the 50th person and each transaction were hampered by the BS'ing of the cashier???  Thanks for wasting our valuable time.

Well, we were unfortunate to have sat at a table next to the narrow aisle when the line started to get long again, and we had asses in our faces when people in line had to scoot into us to make way for people passing by.  Dumb minimum wage order taker didn't put much thought into why people were using common sense to form the line in the other direction.

What tops it off is that it comes wrapped in gold and so it looks like a gold bullion because of the sandwich's brick shape. And of course it should because that hunk of whichery is effing golden! 

I always get the Carribean Jerk Chicken and it never fails me. The bread is this rectangular cut, well toasted sponge bread. I detected some little bell peppers and a tinge of spice in the sauce which satisfied the buds. I also had Broccoli Cheddar soup and it was a bit thin but I could tell they threw some black pepper in there to make things a bit more exciting. 

The only complaints I have are A) They need to start making more shit! and B) It is a bit expensive (you'll walk away spending $12 for a sammich, soup and drink). Other than that, it's absolute perfection!

Oh one last complaint, there's only three locations and only the Vegas location is supposed to cater to everybody on the West Coast. Eff you Earl. Eff you for your greediness by hoarding your gold bars of delicious sandwiches.",2,1,2

I had the MONTAGU sandwich. My first impression was the bread was warm, crispy and crunchy since it was just right out of the oven. I thought the bread was the best part of the sandwich. 

The sandwich fillings were just regular turkey and roast beef, some lettuce and tomatoes. Nothing special about them. They kinda tasted bland actually. I had to put more mustard to pump up the flavors.

Turns out they have a sandwich with pineapple and it was delicious! My usual order though is either the The Earls Club or the Holiday Turkey. I love the holiday turkey because it's basically thanksgiving in sandwich form. It's just an explosion of flavor in every bite.

Now let's talk atmosphere. Considering this location is in Planet Hollywood, it can get pretty loud. There's a bar across from it and the casino on the other end. So when talking you might want to speak up. They have couple TVs mounted on the walls for you to watch...usually plays sports but at one point I caught it on Comedy Central once lol. There's plenty of open seating at night but during the day it tends to be kind of full.

Customer service here is decent. They always cater to your needs. Looking at a menu can be overwhelming at times, so don't hesitate to ask for help! I mean that's how I found my fave sandwich. They tend to be quick with their orders. They give you a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready.

Overall, considering that this place is open 24\/7...def my go-to place if I want something quick but delicious.",2,0,1

I've tried four sandwiches here: the Full Montagu, Earl's Club, All American, and Chicken Chipotle Avocado. All of the sandwiches were absolutely delicious and really filling! Toasted bread, tender meat, creamy sauces.... Yum. My favorite was the All American - the sweet and tangy cranberry sauce adds a whole other dimension to it.

And it's ONLY $6.49 A SANDWICH! One of the best deals on the Strip.

I tried the butternut squash soup as well, which was also yummy. Creamy but not too heavy. For drinks, I got the Earl Grey Lemonade, which turned out to be not that great... Tasted like watery lemonade with some earl grey tea mixed in. The sandwiches made it all better though. :)",1,0,0

It's too bad that it's located within the strip. Sure, it can be a great spot for tourists, but a terrible place for a local to hit up. The strip is never a fun place to travel to, especially during the peak dining hours. Despite that, I guess I shouldn't complain though. The next closest location is over 1,000 miles away.

I've been here a few times. Never been disappointed once. Here's a brief rundown on two things I tried:

""The Full Motagu - Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard."" It's a more traditional tasting sandwich, but really hits the sweet spot if this is what you're in the mood for.

""All American - Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato."" This was one of my favorites. The addition of cranberries added a nice twist to the sandwich. It's somewhat comparable to the Bobbie at Capriotti's, except you don't feel like you went through a Thanksgiving feast after eating it.

Prices are definitely very reasonable for a strip location. I'd think that these prices were for an off-strip location. A hot sandwich will run you about $6-8. Add a cup of tomato soup with your sandwich and you're golden. This isn't a place I'd go out of my way for, but a sure stop every time I'm in the area.",2,0,0

For $5.99 (which is an extremely small price to pay considering the type of $$$$ you spend everywhere else on the Strip), you get a fusion baby (panini x subway) that is conveniently cut in two for you to share. Unlike subway, the bread wasn't soggy even with all the sauces + meats on them. It was slightly toasted\/crunchy which is exactly how I like it! I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ, All American, Italian, and the Original, and since it was only 7:30AM in the morning, there was absolutely no line! We were in and out of Planet Hollywood within 10 minutes. ALL of the ones we ordered were pleasantly warm to the touch (FRESH!!!!) and deliciously fulfilling. The meats were perfect (and I usually don't like anything but chicken), the sauces were perfect; everything complimented each other and in perfect proportions. I know Hawaiian BBQ sounds a little questionable with BBQ sauce and pineapple, but it was my favorite! Don't knock it till you've tried it.

Best part? Open 24 freaking 7!

Worst part? It won't deter me from coming back, but the cashier working at the time had an incredibly bad attitude. It seemed as if she didn't want to be there (& I can't exactly blame her since it was so early), and when my brother didn't immediately take the pager (little black device that would signal to us that our order was ready), she DROPPED it on the table.

As you can see, The Full Montagu is not an adult themed show featuring scantly clad sexy boys shaking their junk for the masses. This Full Montagu is a big, warm, mouthwatering sandwich packed with freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomatoes and Earl's Mustard Sauce (I also add banana peppers). This sandwich is perfect. It's salty. It's sweet and because I added peppers, it's also slightly spicy. And the bread it's served on, oh that bread is great too. Lightly toasted on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. 

Besides the FM, Earl also has a good amount of other amazing tasting sandwiches, both hot and cold, like their Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Cannonballs, both of which I sampled before (at the location in FL).  They also have salads, wraps, chips, tasty desserts and even breakfast Sammie's http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw

1. Go to the Miracle Mile Information Booth and ask for a Coupon Book. Inside you will find a 10% OFF coupon (entire purchase). If they asked how did you hear about the coupon, let them know you heard it from Southwest.

2. Lines could get long after 12 p.m, but they're very efficient and they move insanely fast. Open 24hrs.

Here is how I would rank the 5 sandwiches I tried:

1. The Earl's Club - Simply Delicious 4.5 \/ 5 Stars

2. The Full Montagu - 4.25 \/ 5 Stars

3. Tuna Melt - 4.25 \/ 5 Stars

4. The Original - 4 \/ 5 Stars

5. Caribbean Jerk Chicken - 4 \/ 5 Stars

You really can't go wrong with any of these sandwiches I tried. Like many reviews, I think the bread here is amazing! Earl's of Sandwich is affordable @ $5.99 a sandwich and they are absolutely delicious. If you like Horseradish or the taste of Hot Mustard, the Original may be the one for you. I highly advise people to split their sandwiches with their friends, just so one can try a variety of sandwiches.

Chicken Noodle Soup - 2.5 \/ 5 Stars",4,1,2

If you are starving after skipping breakfast\/lunch from sleeping\/gambling, and just want to pick up something quick, this is THE PLACE to go.  I think what makes them so good is the bread and the toasted heat.  The bread is fluffy and not the regular toast or the baguette kind that you'd get from Subways.

SAY HELLO to EARLS!

One of the reasons I stay at Planet Hollywood is that I love having access to a warm, filling, and delicious Earl's Sandwich 24 hours a day...This place is always busy and for good reason. Sandwiches run about $6-$7 and even with a side and a drink, you'll be a little over $10. 

Each sandwich is toasted and made to order, so it always comes out nice and warm.  Everybody has their own favorite and mine is the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. BBQ Chicken, pineapple, and ham is the best! However, the Chipotle Chicken, Tuna Melt, Roast Beef, Pastrami sandwiches are my other picks haha. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here..whether you are sober or not!

The busiest times are during peak meal times (12-1pm, 5-7pm) and after hours for the  clubbing crowd. However, there usually is a line regardless of any time of the day. My only gripe about this place is that sandwiches can be put together pretty sloppy...especially when it's busy.

The other 2 times I ate here, everything was all good (normal day time hours).

This particular time, it was 6AM, and I was hungry for a bacon and egg sandwich. We were at MGM and it wasn't a far trek over to Planet Hollywood. I was practically in pajamas still, knowing that everyone else passing by us at this time, probably looked worse anyway cause they would have been coming home from a night of debauchery (and all that lovely things that come with that HAHA). 

No line. YES! Got a bacon, egg and cheddar on ciabatta and a coffee. 

Man that sammy was hot. Like steamy, burn your tongue hot! But It sure was good. The bacon was crunchy (ok slightly overcooked but it was still grrreeaat), fluffy egg, melty cheese, toasty ciabatta.

Good Sandwiches. Solid taste for solid price, and there are chips, potato salad, macaroni salad to go with if you want. And a salad section if you are trying to be healthy in vegas. 

Given the stellar reviews of all my yelp friends are other reviewers, I thought this joint would blow my socks away. But in the end, it made me feel like a sandwich is just a sandwich. 

I tried the full Montague, The Original, Tuna Melt and Hawaiian BBQ. Out of those, I thought the Hawaiian BBQ was the best. If you like slightly sweet flavor, you will like it. I was prepared to be impressed by the Tuna Melt, but it felt short for me. The other two sandwiches were just slightly above average sandwiches.

I've had several different sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed.  The All American and the Earl's Club are two of my favorites.  For breakfast I stick to the staple, ham egg and cheese...fabulous!  

One tip my friend and I have learned is splitting a sandwich is a good idea if just looking for a quick snack before the bars.  The lines can be pretty intimidating but they always seem to move at a good pace.

We had to wait in line for probably 15 minutes to order, and then a few more minutes for the sandwich to be made. 

We ended up splitting a Chipotle Chicken Avocado Sandwich. The sandwich was delicious and had a heck of a kick with the spice in the Chipotle sauce. It will clear your sinuses, for sure. 

The prices were about the most reasonable we found during our entire trip. The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly. The menu isn't huge, but everything sounded good.

For $6.99, you get a piping hot sandwich of delicious, soft toasty bread (the bread is definitely a WINNER) filled with fresh ingredients.

I scanned the menu at Earl looking for options and found 2 -- the caprese and tuna. There were 3 of us eating so I ordered one of each. 

TUNA - 

Tuna to mayo ratio - perfect. Not so much mayo to drown out the taste of the tuna but not so little that the flavor of mayo was missing. 

Sandwich bread -- also perfect. It had just the right amount of butter - not so much that your hands become a grease factory after each bite... but not so little that you can't taste that little extra bit of tasty goodness. Also, it was piping hot and perfectly toasted... yummmmm.....
 
Nummy in my tummy factor -- solid 10. This tuna sandwich may have been one of the best tuna sandwiches I've ever had!

The word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.

Arrived and thankfully no line, I asked the dude taking orders to give me what he recommended, something mind blowing for yelp purposes and he said cannonball without hesitation.

The line to pay is separate, short stocky dude charging, drunk talking got me calling him the real earl, he seemed pissed about it, c'mon dude be a good sport.

They give you the vibrating pager and when it rings you go get it at the counter, the usual.

The cannonball was average, there's not much to describe because it's bread and meatballs, they weren't that great and considering everything I eat is better when I'm drunk that's kind of saying a lot. The bread hits the stomach well though.

Random musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. 

Don't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. 

The highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay.

Last week in Vegas as I was going back to my room around 5AM I realized just how hungry I was...and so there it was, Earl of Sandwich- OPEN 24 hours! Hell yes. I ordered myself a BLT Sandwich and to my surprise it was heavenly. The bacon was crisp-and there was an abundance of it. The mayo was not overdone, and the tomatoes, well just ask for extra tomatoes if you are like me ( I like a decent balance between my meats and tomatoes). And it cost like $7!!!!!

I went to sleep and woke up dreaming about Earl of Sandwich..so I had it for breakfast....then lunch...and then dinner..and then a late night midnight snack. I wasn't the only one though, everyone in my group felt the same exact way. I rather eat Earl of Sandwich than go to those dumb restaurants- ( although that all you can eat Brazilian BBQ place at Caesars is the greatest place on Earth).

What I ordered throughout my trip:

BLT sandwich- ask for extra tomatoes

Apple- DELICIOUS and fresh.

Coffee- surprisingly amazing. Although Starbucks is located across the Black Jack  Tables, I wouldn't budge. 

Breakfast Sandwich- Eggs\/Cheese\/Bacon- AMAZING

Chicken\/Avocado Club- this was my second favorite sandwich, I really liked the sauce they used..might have been Chipotle sauce. YUM!

It's like a must to stop by and pick up a sandwich from here when I'm in town and every single time, my sandwiches taste so ridiculously good! 

During my last visit, they had a Limited Edition special going on where you can order a BBQ Chicken or Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which is exactly what I ordered. Just thinking about them makes me crave them as I write this review! The meats were so tender and succulent and the sandwiches were easy to eat! I just love how they aren't made so thick and that they cut them in half so you don't have to do it yourself. Wait time to order varies and seems to go rather quick. You kind of have to be a bird with an eagles eye when it comes to finding a place to sit. Be quick and own that table after someone leaves haha... 

For my fellow germaphobes, there is a hand foaming sanitizer placed against the wall near the fountain drinks and if you need to use the restroom, you'll either have to walk towards the casino to use one or into the mall, take your choice.

First, there is an interrogator at the beginning of the line that attempts to discover which type of sandwich you are getting.

So...this guy's purpose in life at this restaurant is to determine which sandwich you want?  Ok....fine.  I will play along.

I ordered the Reuben.  He printed out my receipt.  I paid for the sandwich, my fiance's sandwich, a bag of chips, and two drinks at the end of the line.  They then gave me these nifty lighted thingys that will inform me when my sandwich is completed and ready for pickup.  Ok...organized....good.

To my surprise the lighted up thing went off about 5 minutes into the wait.  I thought ""cool...I get my sandwich before these other people that were way ahead of me in line...it must be because of my total rewards tier credit...they are treating me right!""  

WRONG.  First, EOS told me they do not take part in the Total Rewards, which sucks, and the reason they turned on the lighted thing was to tell me they had no Pastrami.

My friend Nick compared this to Quiznos, and I couldn't agree more--the place even smells like one. It's nice that they have a deep menu, but today I tried to order a slight variation of their Mediterranean sandwich and I thought I blew the counter girl's mind.

The bread is good--there's no question about that. But they were light on the veggies, and I think they forgot the banana peppers entirely. I had their peppermint brownie which knocked you on the face with mint but was a bit dry.

As a first timer this weekend, I decided to try the original sandwich..the meat to bread ratio was decent and the horseradish sauce was not too over powering in flavor; great compliment for the thinly sliced and tender roast beef and cheese...  I was able to taste my friend's club sandwich which was equally as heavenly as mine.

Me and my companion kinda looked at each other like ""Are we in the right place? Or...?"" Then, the cashier looked up and just stared. No ""Can I help you?"" or ""What can I get you?"" or even ""Are you going to order?"" just a stare, and it was not a happy look. It was a look that I would describe as ""contemptuous"" or ""irritated"" as in ""Hi assh#le, Would you get on with your order? I don't like you, and I find you unattractive."" I mean, come on. How hard is it to take a sandwich order? The people at Subway have to make 'em, too! This guy couldn't have handled that.

-They have changed the menu. Unfortunately, some of our favorites have been removed. Disappointing.

-The sandwiches were just OK. Nothing special. The bread is good, but the rest of the sandwich was just average. I would consider it dry, bland, and just thrown together. My companion and I both felt the same way, though we ordered different sandwiches. 

Earl of Sandwich, I used to be a huge fan, but we left feeling kinda disappointed this time. Please improve your service and bring the quality of the food back up!",1,2,1

Instead of all that, just remember that inside the PH, is the Earl of Sandwich.

A warm, comforting place that will rock your world, soul, socks and anything else that is worth rockin'. 

The EoS is the spot that will kill your inner beast (better than del taco) with a heavenly sandwich.

A while back, I stumbled into this place and ordered a Caprese sandwich and fell in love. Ever since, I make an extra effort to come out to the EoS for a sandwich. Yes, it's worth my effort to valet park at a Strip hotel, just for a sandwich.

Some highlights:

1. The bread. Fantastic crust, remarkable chewy dough, and a solid undertone of flavor. Blends well with any sandwich.
2. Solid ingredients. Tomatoes, lettuce, etc. None of that stuff is wilted, gross or mossy. Can't say that about most sandwich shops on and off the strip (ahem SUBWAY).
3. Menu. There is something for everyone on this menu, and the sandwich creations are very creative. The Original 1762, Cannonballs, Hawaiian BBQ.

That being said I thought my sandwich was amazing. Full disclosure: I was drunk when I ate it. Who knows what I would have thought if I ate it while sober.

I split the chicken chipotle avocado with a friend because there's an Earl of Sandwich close to home in Anaheim and I've seen those gold bricks sandwiches on Instagram posts which looked larger than life. I regret that decision and wish I'd gotten my own sandwich because I devoured that half sandwich. We got chipotle sauce on the side because I put sauce only if the sandwich is bland. Surprise surprise it wasn't bland and I ended up not using any of the chipotle sauce at all. Bacon was crunchy and perfect. The mac and cheese was amazing. My drunk self decided to put the mac and cheese in the sandwich and it was a flavor explosion.

That's really it.  There isn't anything magical about it at all.  I'm not going to dock it for my moderate disappointment (after all, it absolutely housed Marilyn's Cafe which was at a similar price point), but I'm not going to pretend it was something more than an average experience.  I'd go here again if I wanted something fast and cheap.",6,2,2

the ""earl of sandwich"" is located inside the planet hollywood mall. when we arrived, a long line snaked outside into the mall, making it look quite promising. i would say the decor gave me the impression of an upscale quiznos + starbucks combined.

anyhow, the large display of the full montagu got my attention - a ""large"", mouthwatering sandwiched loaded with meat. even the description made it sound appetizing - fresh roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and sharp cheddar cheese with lettuce, roma tomatoes, and mustard sauce stuffed into their artisan loaf. on the contrary, all their sandwiches came in the form of a 6""x3"" brick-wrapped foil - totally misleading. after unwrapping it, it appeared as though they took a full sandwich and compacted into this square block, more filling than expected  because i could not finish it. anyhow, this combination of ingredients ended up tasting rather plain. the bread probably had the most flavor.

their tomato soup with housemade croutons is pleasant and not too shabby. the potato salad looked delicous, but ended up being a bit too salty. their lemonade ice tea reminded me of sonic's - watered down with not enough lemon flavoring.

I was sober, and I knew that there were numerous other affordable options if I was willing to hop back into my car and motor into the hinterlands of local Las Vegas.

With all that in consideration, what the fiddlesticks? Yes, my sandwich tasted yummy and warm, but a couple of concerns:

1. What are your bread options? None. You're getting a white bun. It is a good white bun, a delectable cross between a biscuit and ciabatta, but I am a girl who enjoys at least the option of wheat.

2. Do they have hot peppers? No. I think the hallmark of a noble sandwich shop is their ability to heat up a sammie with peppers. The spiciest thing the Earl offers is pepperoncini. That does not count. It might as well be a pickle.

3. Where's the beef? The meat inside the slices was a little skimpy. The ratio of bread to meat was approximately 3 to 1. 

4. Am I full? After one sandwich, I am pretty sure I could have eaten another without suffering from a stomach ache. 

Yes, the end product tastes darn good. They are open 24-hours. My husband celebrated the option of Diet Dew on the fountain. The food is affordable for the Strip, but I wouldn't make it a point to return to The Strip just to visit with the Earl.",38,20,19

One thing I don't understand - there's a location in Paris, UK, and Qatar, but NONE in Northern California?! Someone give me $500k and I'll open one in the Bay (YAY) Area! 

Btw, we got the Full Montagu, Tuna Melt and Hawaiian BBQ. My favorite is the Full Montagu of course, followed by the Hawaiian BBQ. I had the tuna melt when it wasn't fresh anymore (we bought 3 to eat later) and it was still good, but could've been better if it was fresher. 

There was plenty of seating when we went because it was 6 or 7 in the morning.

This always leads me to question how hard it really is to stick meat in bread and eat it... I mean, could humanity really have gone that long before coming up with such an idea? Or is it that this guy, Earl of Sandwich, just proclaimed it first? 

Anyway, I digress...

The kicker here is the bread- baked fresh and run through an oven with the toppings so that a crusty exterior and gooey interior can create magic in your first bite. 

I can always go for more meat and cheese in any sandwich, but for the very fair price of $5.99 per sandwich, I'm not complaining. So far, I've sampled the Full Montagu (#1 for me), the Original (#1 also for me, it's a tie), the club (#3 for me), the italian (#4 for me) and the hawaiian (#5, but this will fall quickly as I sample the others- the sauce is too sweet for me). 

If you ever get the chance, order a salad. The croutons kick serious ass. 

The lines can get long, but the staff runs through it quickly. You order from the sandwich\/salad\/wrap\/soup menu first and are given a buzzer.

When you hot food is ready, you're buzzed. I usually don't sit in my seat for more than three minutes before I get the buzzer of joy.

The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.

For those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.

My sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.

I would suggest entering Planet Hollywood Casino from the Southern entrance near the Fire bar and looking for the information desk. Don't actually talk to the information desk, mind you, but you'll see Earl's nearby. It's also posted on a lot of information signs overhead.

We visited this place twice in one weekend because we were so enamoured with these sandwiches. They have a wide variety of choices, and the many I tried all punched me in the face with savoury sandwich superiority. They don't seem that customizable in terms of toppings or bread options, but honestly I didn't ask. The bread is probably some of the best I've had on a 'wich. Simultaneously crispy and soft; a perfect vessel for all the delicious toppings. 

For a sandwich shop tucked into the base of the Planet Hollywood casino that always seems to have a line no matter what time you go, the prices are pretty reasonable. The service is quick (though fast-foodish), and pretty pleasant even if you show up at three in the morning (which we did).

My faves were the Carribean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu. The sandwiches are not huge so sharing three or four among a couple is not unreasonable. Especially if you are a glutton like me.

Luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. The wife and I decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. All 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and I thought they portioned everything just right. It's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point. 

The Full Montagu - I believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. The turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. This sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss\/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. They also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.

Chipotle Chicken Avocado - My wife's favorite of the 3. Large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. The chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which I really liked.

The Italian - This was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. The flavor was great but they put way too much Italian dressing on it. My favorite part was the cheese, I am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!

The bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. It tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. It's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. Chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. Just excellent bread!

We also had some sides...potato salad and a fruit cup. The potato salad was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. They give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. I wish I had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.

Was this the best sandwich I ever ate? No...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get.

The sandwich is not that big but definitely packs in a ton of flavor. Their secret might be the delicious bread that comes with the sandwich.

Nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking  Earl of Sandwich reminds me of Corner Bakery meets Subway or Jersey Mikes or Quizno's ( you get the idea) . 
They have an ample array of sammie offerings and the somewhat daunting line is a testament to this particular locations popularity. The line rivals In n Out except it's just the humans sans cars.  
They offer soups, salads, and of course Sandwiches and  wraps. Count people watching as an entertaining distraction while you are waiting for your order to be filled.  It seems many a hangover victim are either slumped over in their chairs or recounting their past evenings exploits while waiting in line. 
Once you get past the line and the wait the actual sandwich's are reasonably priced and filling enough to tide you over until your next meal. I have been here a few times and I like the convenience of ordering the food to go, especially if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.   It doesn't hurt they are open 24 hours which is surprisingly hard to find even in Vegas.

They have a variety of sandwiches which all come come toasted and items such as coleslaw , potato salad or earls brand kettle potato chips to add to them. Or soup for dipping those yummy sandwiches into. They also have bakery items including cookies , muffins and brownies to satisfy your sweettooth. 

I'm a creature if habit so when I find something I like. I like to stick with it because I know it won't disappoint me. So I usually go for the Caprese or the Holiday turkey. 

Caprese - Thick slices of Mozzerella cheese toasted on artisan bread topped with tomato , balsamic glaze and basil. So yummy and perfect with tomato soup. So comforting & always hits the spot. 

Holiday Turkey - I love thanksgiving sandwiched between some bread. Capriottis had the Bobbie and Earls they make a slightly different version of that tastier IMO too. Turkey breast on artisan bread with gravy , stuffing , and cranberry sauce. So yummy ! 

Hawaiian BBQ - my boyfriends fav. Chicken , BBQ sauce , ham , swiss and pineapple.  Maybe it was sauced to heavily for my taste and the pineapple was canned. Menu says fresh. Clearly not. Or maybe it was the fact that the chicken and everything was sliding around and I hate that. Personally not my fav. 

The portion size is great too. Not too big or too small. I loved the way it's packaged too. Gold wrapping with little emblems like little gifts.

Anyway, I shared the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and a cup of Clam Chowder with my boyfriend and I thought that was the perfect amount of food.  The sandwich was grilled to a perfect crisp and the chicken was very moist.  The sauce added the right amount of tang and kick and the banana peppers added the perfect extra crunch.  I would definitely recommend that sandwich.  The clam chowder on the other hand was very mediocre and not something that I would get again.

Missing the holidays? No worries, you can get their holiday turkey sandwich all year long! Great sandwich, cranberry sauce gave the right amount of sweetness.

The All American is the perfect mix of tangy, savory and sweet and the bread is always perfectly toasted. I'm getting so hungry just writing this review!

Do be prepared for a loooong wait if you go during peak or near peak times. Also if you're local, the drive, park and long walk to get to Earl is a chore and has kept us from going more often.

I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and an Earl's Grey Lemonade. I paid at the register and patiently waited for my drink. The cashier asked me to wait on the side and that it would take just a few minutes for me to get my drink. 10 minutes pass and i'm awkwardly standing next to the cash register. Where is my drink? No one was giving me any information? Eventually I ask someone working there for my drink and show him my receipt. He tells me that they don't have any Earl's Grey Lemonade right now. Wait... what? I already paid! Being the nice person that I am I opted for an iced tea instead. I got no apology or compensation for the drink mishap and the wait. That turned me off a little bit.

Then I took a bite of my Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. It was good, but not great. The sandwich was a little bit on the dry side.

Each sandwich I ordered were $6.49. In the order from worst to best:
1) Earl's Club: bacon, turkey, lettuce, tomato. You ordinary club sandwich. I wasn't very impressed.
2) Chipotle Chicken and Avocado: I appreciated their generosity with the avocado. The sandwich itself reminded me of Panera's chipotle chicken panini. It was okay.
3) The Full Montagu: roast beef, turkey, and cheese with sauce. The meat was moist and warm. I savored every bite!

LOCATION
-------------------------

My friends and I went here because it is conveniently located in the Miracle Mile Shop which is connected to our hotel in Elara! It seems, that this location can get incredibly busy, but their workers are pretty fast with taking orders & prepping the sandwich. They have a system that works since we didn't have to wait so long for our foods! OH, and I guess they are open 24 hours!

FOOD
-------------------------

My best friend and I had to try the Caribbean Jerk Chicken since it stood out to us the most and.... well she hasn't had ""jerk chicken"" before!

I'd say this place is pretty cheap compared to other places on the strip! Me being a newbie expected it to be some big sandwich, but it's actually small, but good. It isn't the greatest or a five star sandwich in my opinion but it was good for the price and it's something that will fill you up if you are looking for a quick meal!

SERVICE
-------------------------

I did mention their fast service here above which I thought was great! The cashier during our visit had mistakenly entered my friend's order,... which resulted to one of the managers yelling at him in front of us... *AWKWARD*. We all thought the yelling was unnecessary especially in front of customers. I didn't think the manager at that time responds well to pressure and the how busy they got.

Would I return? Absolutely! I wanna try their other sandwiches, and will definitely go for the ones my friends had recommended next time!",2,1,1

Stop by for a break after hours at the casino or when you've been out all night. This place is obviously known for their sandwiches, but you could also grab a salad or soup here among other sides. It is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops and is accessible from the casino side of Planet Hollywood.

Full Montagu ($6.99): It's a nicely made toasted sandwich filled with roast beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and mustard; I asked for wheat and they made it happen! The ingredients were fresh and packed nicely together; the staff making them were not skimping on the meat or vegetables. Flavor wise, the mustard was particularly strong, slightly overpowering the meats. Outside of that, however, I honestly have no complaints about this sandwich. 

The Italian ($6.99): It's filled with salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, Roma tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and Italian dressing. Even with all the different slices of meat, the sandwich was not salty. It was very flavorful and made well.

If you're looking for a snack or some late-night munchies, definitely drop by and buy a couple. The prices are very reasonable and, most importantly, the sandwiches are delicious. Lines go pretty quick, but the sandwiches do take a few minutes to make. You get an order pager while waiting for your order.",1,0,1

In other words, restaurants are either pricey without quality food, or you have to wait in line forever, or it's a buffet.

The good:
- I had a Full Montagu and it was quite delicious. Good ingredients, flavorful and the bread was so good that the sandwich still tasted good the next day.
- Their selection is good, and they sell a good variety of healthy sides and drinks - even milk!
- Price-wise I think Earl of Sandwich is very reasonable. After reading reviews I expected some high prices but 6 dollars is what you pay at most other good sandwich places too.

The bad:
- The sandwiches are small! Luckily I only wanted a small snack, but for 6 dollars I am used to sandwiches which are 1 1\/2 the size of what you get here.

I tried my friends sandwich, the montage, and it was good as well but not as juicy (no bacon) and not as flavorful (probably the bacon again) as my sandwich (bacon!).

My friend, Andrea C., was raving about this place during the ENTIRE CAR RIDE to Vegas. Obsessed much? But, she has a good reason to be, this place really good.

It's cheap, and you don't have to go very far (off the strip) to get a bite to eat. I tried the holiday sandwich (turkey + cranberry) and the italian. BOMB.COM!, Although I'm sure that all of choices are good.

They say that the bread makes the sandwich. Well, the bread here tastes really fresh and good. On top of that, they definitely don't skimp out on any of the ingredients!

I have a mission: To try every sandwich on the menu! You know what that means... MORE VEGAS TRIPS! :)

There is always a long line here no matter what time of the day it is. And yes, they are open 24 hours. But even though the lines are long, they move fairly fast though. 

I usually get the Original, which comes with roast beef, cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce. Amazing. It tastes consistently the same. I can not come here for a few years and order the same thing, and it'll taste the same as I last remembered it. 

So you line up to order first, then they'll give you those pagers and you walk past the line with chips, drinks and cookies, and then you pay.

I honestly did not want to get my hopes up about this place because like I've mentioned before when it comes to food I'm too pretentious and stubborn to believe an opinion about food other than my own :p

I was so impressed by this place not just by the taste but the price, quantity, quality of food and the BREAD...yes the BREAD. They make their own artisan bread and it's one of the best sandwich breads I've ever tasted. Crispy outside, soft on the inside however biting through it, the textures come together and it's yeast n flour filled divinity.

I bought the BEST BLT for myself but my friends and I shared with each other so I sampled 4 different sandwiches including mine: Hawaiian BBQ, Cannonballs!, The Full Montagu and mine the BEST BLT.

Hawaiian BBQ: sweet and savory just like anything ""Hawaiian"" but with BBQ sauce and pineapple and a generous serving of ham.
Cannonballs!: a meatball sandwich that won't fall apart on you. Solidly constructed with Parmesan and chewy melted Mozzarella makes an excellent sandwich
The Full Montagu: the reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star review, wasn't that impressed just tasted like a regular roast beef sandwich but still good
BEST BLT: Lives up to its name! Most BLT's is a couple of strips of bacon that you pull out with one bite and all your bacon is gone. This BLT sandwich is filled with bacon bits throughout and is a must for anyone who enjoys this classic sandwich.

Earl's definitely lived up to the hype and is a must-go on my Vegas trips from now until eternity and maybe a little bit after that too :p.",0,0,0

It took me about a year to use them because I was not convinced I would like them a second time.I will say I was wrong, my sandwich choice this time was the roast beef cheddar and horseradish was mighty tasty the meat was tender the bun was perfectly tossed just the right amount of horseradish(you know too much can be over powering). the Mac and cheese with bacon was good just the right amount of creamy! The bacon pieces were a bit big so half way through the Mac n cheese all the bacon was gone next time I am going to ask them to chop it up a bit more for me, for me it's a bit over priced. My husband ordered the Italian sandwich and to me it's the best sandwich they have he wasn't crazy about the pasta salad said it was a bit bland.

My sweetheart got the The Full Montagu,  roast beef, turkey,  swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. We each took a bite of each others sandwich and they are both delicious.

We also both ordered a side of potato salad, mmm yum made with the red skin potatoes, was good.

My first experience at Earl of Sandwich was pretty amazing. Long line, but it moved rapidly; not much seating, but people always vacating periodically.  The highlight, of course was the food. I got the Chipotle Chicken Avo and an Earl Grey Lemonade, my friend the Club and a tomato soup. We ended up swapping halves of the sandwiches, and so glad we did!

The Club is buttery and moist and flavorful--crisp veggies and crunchy bacon and yummy turkey. The Chipotle Chicken Avo--WOW.  It's moved onto the list of sandwiches that I will periodically crave randomly.  The chicken is super moist, the cheese, avocado, bacon, and lettuce balance perfectly with the slightly spicy chipotle sauce, and is all sandwiched between chewy and crusty artisan bread. 

Friend loved the tomato soup (she was fan from before) and my Earl Grey Lemonade was pretty good as far as Arnold Palmers go. 

Second experience was after a hard night's partying and before a long charter bus ride back to LA. I ordered on the phone for pick-up and was pleasantly surprised that it would only take 5 minutes for my sandwiches to be ready.  A short walk from the Cosmopolitan, I was back in time with our sandwiches in time to make the bus.  We got the CCA again (how could we not?!) and the Full Montagu... Which, sadly paled in comparison to the Club from yesterday.  Still hearty and filling, but in juxtaposition with the two others, just a tad bland.  

When back in Sin City, I will definitely hit up the Earl again.  At this price and quality, I'd be a fool not to!  Plus, it's open 24 hours--and offers some dangerously delectable looking desserts.",1,0,0

I had the holiday turkey: turkey, cranberry, mayo, cornbread stuff, etc. on sourdough.

You order at one register and pay at the other. It was pretty crowded so just hang around to nab a seat at a table. They're sandwiches so the tables turn over pretty quickly.

Holiday turkey was so delicious with just the right balance of creaminess and sweetness from the cranberry. A generous amount of turkey means that for most appetites, one of those sandwiches will be more than enough! 

Just make sure you eat fast because the wet ingredients (mayo, cranberry sauce, stuffing) soak the bread faster than normal.

I love that they wrap them in gold foil so you feel like you've got a gold bar in your hands.

A bit pricey, but part of it is the brand name and the hype. $8-9 bucks for a 6 inch or so sandwich but it's super dense and filling. Normally I wouldn't pay so much for a sandwich but it's a great iconic place to go and I would say the taste is worth it!

I ordered two sandwiches, the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu, and ate half of each. I was really hoping the sandwiches would very delicious. But it was just OK in my book. Nothing wrong with them, mind you. I just was thinking I'd be wowed with flavor.

That's probably the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars here, even though I wanted to. The service was fast, they kept the line moving swiftly, there was decent amount of seating available, and clean.

If you're anywhere near this part of the strip, staying at either the Cosmo, Bellagio, PH towers\/Elara, or clubbing at Marquee, you're more than likely going to end up here at some part of the day.

Very solid hot sandwiches, everything from the toppings to sauce is well balanced within and for $6 its quite the steal in Vegas. With their toasted bread, each bite is paired with a savory crunch along with their simple sauces, making it hard not to fall in love with what you're eating. I personally get the Full Montague when I swing by the first time since another future sandwich is inevitable. Stand out sandwiches include the original and club, and if you're feeling adventurous go with the Caribbean jerk sandwich.

Their sandwiches are about $7, their hot sandwiches are very flavorful, and their meats are great.  

Their full montague is their most popular sandwich.  I've also tried their carribean jerk, which has a mild spice to it.  This visit, I tried their seasonal turkey sandwich, which had stuffing and cranberry sauce.  The turkey was moist and it was just a well made sandwich.

These are flavor-packed sandwiches and a solid option for cheap eats in the middle of the strip.  If you're looking for other cheap eats on the strip, I'd recommend that you venture to the ""Secret Pizza"" place in Cosmopolitan, to Chipotle by Harrah's, and to the food court at Excalibur (where you can find Quiznos, McD, Pizza Hut, Krispy Kreme, and Baja Fresh sans markup).  On the other side of town, then you could go to Circus Circus, Tacos El Gordo, or the Fashion Show Mall for budget eats.  (Downtown is a different story altogether),

It was my first time eating Caprese but boy was it AMAZING. Everything was made to perfection from the balsamic vinegar to the bread.
And let me point out that this is probably one of the best aspects about this place: the bread. It's crunch and soft and fresh all at once, no complaint heres!

To be honest, I didn't know about Earl's until last year. My guy friend told me about Earl of Sandwich in Vegas and he was ranting about how it's the best sandwich on earth. Intrigued, I signed up for Earl's club immediately and decide to give it a try next time I went to Vegas, which was this past weekend for my 23rd birthday. :)

I got to Earl's on Saturday around 12pm and boyyyyyy, the line was pretty long. But no need to worry because the workers there are super speedy and you'll have your food in due time! I knew which sandwich I wanted in a heartbeat, ""The Full Montagu"". Freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard sauce. Mmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water! I want some NAO.

Anyway, Earl's sandwiches are nicely toasted, which makes the outside crisp yet they somehow manage to keep the bread moist and soft in the inside. Cheese are hot and stringy while my mustard sauce gave a nice kick to the sandwich. I added some pepper that they had on their dining table, which wasn't just regular pepper. It was a little bit herby and tasted bombbbb. My best friend got herself the ""Hawaiian BBQ"" and she also loved her sandwich, which means a lot knowing she's a picky eater hah

And the best thing about my first Earl of Sandwich experience was that it was FREE (not that it's expensive to begin with). Yay, thanks Earl's club for my freebie coupon! I'll be satisfying my craving next weekend when I'm in Vegas again!

The sandwiches are pretty good, I tried 3 of them at my first visit. I had the Italian, Caribbean Jerk, and the Full Montague (i believe). The Caribbean Jerk was my favorite out of the three. What makes the sandwiches good is the toasted and warm bread. Pretty good sandwich for $6, and a good portion as well.

Also, lastly I would like to mention that the Ice Cream sandwiches they serve are really good as well. My friend and I got one when we were stumbling across the Miracle Mile Shops drunk with our friends.... it was soo good and it was huge... only for ~$3.

Came here on a Friday around 11:30am-12pm, only one person in line in front of us. Thank god we beat the lunch rush case when we finished eating the line was looong.

I got the Earls Club and my friend got the Full Montague. The Earls club was just your typical sandwich, the ingredients inside didnt blow my mind and I'd probably choose Togo's turkey avocado sandwich over this one. The Full Montague was better, it was meatier and had a more flavorful sauce. I felt the warm and yummy bread for the sandwiches was more standout than the contents. My total came out to be around 6.50.

Yesterday we tried The Original 1762 (made with beef and cheese) and it was fantastic! Unfortunately, we also tried The Earl's Club (made with Turkey and Bacon) and it stunk... the Turkey was stinky and slimy...a sign that the deli meat they are using isn't fresh.

From the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!

When a couple of my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  Given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of ""if"" there would be a wait, but ""how long"", especially since we were going around 7:00.  Much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  Score!  

Since my friend and I both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  While she ordered The Original 1762 (Roast Beef, Sharp Cheddar, and Horseradish Sauce), I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, and Italian Dressing).  Even though I tried to set aside any expectations I had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews I read.  While the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  With all the hype though, it was bound to happen.

- The Original 1762 (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=REJJpOEpwaK0fLvh-bKn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  The roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  I wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  
- Italian (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=k8Po4fzJS9cgJcYsOdhfrw) - okay, but I think the Hot Italian at JJ Boulangerie at the Paris hotel is better (and bigger).  I liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  The Roma tomatoes added some freshness, but I could have used less of them.  Ditto for the Italian Dressing.

Regardless of anything else, Earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the Strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  Plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at Paris or the bar at Bally's.  For those reasons, I'm rounding up from THREE AND A HALF to four.  Had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), I probably would have loved Earl of Sandwich.  Instead, depending on the sandwich I want, I might lean towards JJ Boulangerie instead and save my Earl trips for post drinking\/clubbing adventures.",7,6,9

This time around, we went for a late lunch at around 2pm on Saturday, and waited about 15 min to order. Got the Montagu and tried the mac and cheese for the first time. The mac was nice and cheesy, a very solid choice. (However Bacchanal has some of the dankest mac&cheese in Vegas). 

There's not much else I can say about this place. You get consistent sandwiches for reasonable prices. All I have to add is that you should buy 2 sandwiches: 1 for your meal, and another to take back to your hotel room and eat later. That way, you can try another sandwich if you're like me and will always get the Montagu.

It's creamy, and tomatoey, but not too overwhelming.

BF's 1st time here (and almost the same for me since the last time I had it, I was a little kid & all I remembered was that I didn't care for it to much at the time). Both the BF and I ordered the Holiday Turkey Sandwich. Their own artisan bread was toasted just right and wasn't too dense or dry. The stuffing was flavorful and the kind that's more on the wet side than the dry stuffing that I'm used to. Not too much gravy to make the sandwich soggy (if eaten right away). The cranberry sauce was on the sweet side instead of the tart (which I prefer). The turkey are deli slices so they weren't dry but I would've preferred if they were thicker slices. Overall a good sandwich. Their salt & vinegar kettle chips went well with the sandwiches so I recommend getting a bag. The Earl Grey Lemonade was interesting but didn't have as much early grey flavor as I would've liked. BF didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is Earl Grey.

If there is a line, it moves pretty quickly because they just take your order, you choose your drinks, and then you pay and take a number.  When your food is ready, you go and pick it up to the right of the cash register, and there is plenty of dining space for everybody.

On this visit I got the Jerk Chicken sandwich while my buddy got a Chipotle Avocado Chicken sandwich, and then we split a Spicy Italian.  Each of us enjoyed the quality of the ingredients and the way they all worked together between two perfect pieces of bread.  All sandwiches were very flavorful, nice and toasty, and pretty economically priced at around $6 each.  Is it the same price to quantity ratio as Subway? No. But it is a better quality experience for just a little more.  I'd defintiely recommend a visit to the Earl.",2,0,0

I've had better sandwiches.  I felt like for the price I was paying there should have been more stuff in it.  It was a bit too plain for me.  I wish it had more veggies or something it in.

But I have to stay I was still expecting a little bit more judging from all the praise that it was getting. Besides, four stars does mean that I'm a fan, right? Located in Planet Hollywood, it was one of the few places that I ate at during the weekend we spent in Vegas, and among everything, it was probably the best. The place is open 24 hours so that alone, earns my respect.

Surprisingly, even with the long line, it moves pretty rapidly. For larger groups, better have someone reserve your table. Even then, people demand chairs like they belong to them so you may be treated to some rude displays of human beings being human beings. I got a Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich, which is basically a chicken sub with spicy sauce, red peppers and banana peppers. For the most part, the sub was pretty fresh but occassionally, I would get half a pepper that was stale or slightly crusty. I wasn't sure whether it was just dry or toasted too much. Either way, that's a no-no.

Sandwiches run at about $6-8. Earl of Sandwich is a fitting name, it's definitely no King.",4,5,4

Here's the quick outline of my experience: 
1. Where's the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches?
2. Presentation was cool - I liked the nice little sandwich bricks wrapped like little gifts.  I wanted to build a retaining wall with them. 
3. The Original's creamy horseradish was weak and needs more kick.  Too much cream, not enough horseradish. 
4. The Montagu was my favorite but it left me not quite satisfied portion wise.  I had to order another sandwich (The Original).  As a side note, I did enjoy reading the origins of the sandwich from the wall in the dining area. 
5. Roast beef was tender but bloody (that's ok with me).  The amount of roast beef in the sandwich was lacking a few ounces.
6. Kettle cooked chips were crisp and the pieces were whole and not crushed.  
7. Orders were filled fast and exceeded my waiting time expectations. 
8. There were no fresh pickles and chiles (I know it's not a deli...but it would be a nice extra).
9. The sandwiches are warm, not ""hot"" as their slogan says.
10. Holiday turkey sandwich was not fresh carved turkey (a la Capriottis).

It was topped with tomatoes and a vinaigrette type dressing. The Full Montague had roast beef, turkey, cheese, tomatoes. The bread was really good, they were hot sammys, so it came toasted.

We ordered three sandwiches for three people. The Carribean Jerk, Tuna melt, and Roast Beef. All were delicious but my favorite was the tuna melt. I couldn't get enough. Once i finished my half of the roast beef. We all traded to get a different taste.  The tuna melt was nice and hot. That familiar tuna taste was delicious. It didn't even taste heavy like so it was just perfect. I think it is the bread that makes the sandwich. It just so tasty and just enough crunch (not so hard that it scratches the roof of my mouth). All together with the tuna and cheese is amazing. Mouth drooling right now. So good. The Carribean Jerk chicken was delicious as well. Chicken was plenty, moist, and not tough to eat. The peppers: red and yellow made the sandwich giving that jerk taste. Fantastic. The roast beef was alright. I wasn't such a fan of it. It was alright. I think it needed more flavor or something. It didn't leave an impression on me compared to the tuna melt and the carribean jerk. 

I love that Earl of Sandwich is affordable and ummm open 24 hours. I wish we could have stopped by before we left. Sad, we didn't But it is ok. Next time. Maybe it'll be a late night sandwich every night we are there. I'm so looking foreword to it.

What I Had: The Earl's Club ($6) 

Food Review: The Earl's Club includes roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss, lettuce, roma tomatoes, and their special sandwich sauce. It was toasted, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, juicy and spongy, and just overall wonderful. I will admit that it is often a bit overhyped. 

Service Review: Self pick-up, but the people here are friendly and helped me figure out what I wanted to order. 

Venue Review: There is plenty of seating at tables next to the pick-up station, and even with a group of nearly 20 people, we were able to find a spot without too much trouble. 

Overall Impression: I'm a fan! Somehow their sandwiches remind me a lot of a high-end Quizno's, but it's still at a very reasonable price for Vegas, so I think it's got the bang for your buck. Next time I want to try the Montagu!",0,0,0

The ciabatta bread is toasty good and as all great sandwiches go, there's an awesome balance of lettuce, tomatoes, and meat.

""Let's go to Earl's!""
This is the usual convo my friends and I have whenever we are in Vegas. Recently, we stayed in Planet Hollywood for 3 days and every single meal of mine revolved around this place. No regrets!

You can't go wrong with any of their affordable signature hot sandwiches or wraps. What makes the sandwiches so amazing to me, is the bread. My favorite sandwiches are the Hawaiian BBQ (chicken, ham, pineapple, Swiss & BBQ sauce) and Chipotle Chicken Avocado (chicken, bacon, avo, cheddar, lettuce & chipotle sauce.) Since I was there for 3 days, I decided to switch up on the sandwiches and tried the wraps. The Buffalo Chicken wrap is pretty good, but my favorite is the Spicy Tuna wrap (without olives!) What makes it so delicious are the banana peppers, chipotle sauce and balsamic vinaigrette all up in there. I can never finish the whole thing, so I'm glad they always cut them in half for me to eat later. The wraps are great leftovers; the hot sandwiches aren't as good cold, but saving them for later comes in handy after coming back to the hotel hungry from a night of partying. 

The line to order can be pretty long at times, but don't be intimidated because it moves quickly. After ordering, they give you a buzzer that will let you know when your order is ready. The dining area is pretty small for such a popular place, so I usually take my order to go. 

They also have options for soup, salads, breakfast sandwiches and dessert: cookies, chips and brownies. I have yet to try the breakfast sandwiches, but I sure will next time. Besides the food and affordable prices, the other best thing about Earl's is that it's open 24 hours!",2,1,3

I appreciate that there's an affordable option on the Strip, but most casinos have a food court or casual eatery on site somewhere, so price really isn't enough to nudge this into the extra-stars category.
This is basically a slightly-nicer Quizno's.

Earl of Sandwich is a chain that offers (what else?) sandwiches: warm or cold, with side options like chips and cookies, and the occasional soup or salad. While some rave about their bread, I guess I've gone on the wrong days because it didn't blow my mind.

The original is tasty, though I prefer a very light touch with my horseradish. It's refreshing to see a caprese on a fast-food menu, but the bread texture\/density doesn't complement the delicate components of this particular sandwich.

But the fact that this place is rated one of the top five places to dine in Vegas based on star score and number of reviews is downright insulting to the hundreds of phenomenal restaurants we have, even including ones that are not celebrity-chef-owned or expensive.",6,6,3

I did, and ordered the exact same sandwich - the Original. This time, you could see their assembly line running like a well oiled machine producing my order quickly, and efficiently. When I unwrapped the sandwich, steam rose out and cheese oozed from the sides. The ratio of roast beef to bread was perfect and the horseradish was generous. This is the sandwich of my memory.

When I stayed at Planet Hollywood in 2011, we came here for quick breakfast sandwiches and coffee so we could refuel ourselves for the Strip. Their lunch sandwiches are also super good, get the soup and a bag of Salt and Vinegar chips, you're good to go! 

Because every meal in Vegas doesn't need to be expensive, require a reservation months in advance or have a 2 hour wait to get in. I continue to come to this place even when we are not staying at the Planet, it's that delicious.

One day I spent too much time at the Aria spa, I actually came back to my room with some major shakes. Finally figured out it was due to low blood sugar and not having eaten anything since the Buffet for breakfast. First world problems! Absolutely. BUT. Earl of Sandwich to the rescue! I marched right over, got in line and got myself a Club sammich, like a crazed diabetic on a mission. Who knew Spa'ing could actually be considered a sport in Las Vegas and could be so taxing on the system. I felt like a noodle, but after eating lunch I was well enough to continue on with more Vegas adventuring.

What I like about this place is it's cheap, it's quick, it's convenient, it's open 24\/7, it's sort of close to Starbucks, and it's on the outskirts of the casino so you don't have to walk a million miles before surrendering to sandwich simplicity.

After walking over and looking at the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. After watching the wonderful show of KA, it was a bit late and at this point, we were getting a little hungry.

After reviewing the menu, I had decided that we would share a Chicken tortilla soup and I would have the Cannonballs! sandwich, while Bunny got the Earl's Club. The seating area was a little busy, but that's how Vegas life is, always a crowd no matter what time of the day it is, especially for places open 24 hours, like Earl of Sandwich! 

Some would like to go out all and have a big fancy dinner before heading home, but we just wanted to relax and enjoy ourselves so we took it back to our hotel room. My only concern would be our food would be cold.

First thing we tried was the soup, which after taking a sip, I didn't want to share with Bunny :D.  There was a lot of flavor and the spice was not too much for me to handle. The container kept it warm. I wouldn't have minded a few crackers, but hey I'm not complaining. All in all, the soup was good.

On to the main course! Basically the Cannonballs! was a meatball sandwich, along with marina sauce and cheese. I was very happy with my choice!  The meat was nice and fresh and had a lot of flavor in it. There was a perfect amount of sauce and it was not overdone.

I had tried a little bit of Bunny's Earl Club. I'm not a big fan of club sandwiches, but after having a bit, I completed converted. It had just the right amount of all the ingredients and when mixed together, it was great.

The Food: The chips are greasy and not particularly special. The chicken tortilla soup is pretty standard, the kind of soup you'd expect at your local Panera Bread. The chicken mac'n'cheese was actually quite delicious, with a crunchy texture owing to the crumbs they throw on top (mmm mmm mmmm). And the sandwich itself? Nothing special. I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich: The bread was whatever-white-bread, the chicken seemed ok, but not explosive, and the big chunks of avocado were pretty good and fresh. 

Price: Dirt cheap. Under $7 for a sandwich. I understand for the price it may be decent enough. But this is not nearly as good as Ike's in San Francisco. 

Overall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise. Also, the lines can apparently get pretty huge.

1. Original (roast beef, cheddar, horseradish) - The horseradish and beef goes together like hot dog and ketchup. It's PERFECTION! But if you don't like horseradish get the Full Montagu.
2. Full Montagu (roast beef, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato) - Original with veggies minus the horseradish.
3. Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato) - Classic sandwich! Can't go wrong with this one.

I find comfort in their Tomato Soup, whether or not you're hungover or sad that you've lost money. The sour and creamy Tomato Soup will be the best pick-me-up! 

Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Say it a few more times so you will remember to get Chipotle Chicken Avocado. If you are a fan of avocado, this is the sandwich for you. The savory chipotle sauce goes perfectly well with avocado and diced chicken breast. I can devour the entire thing in less than 5 minutes, not even kidding. Then after that, I would go get another one for the long road back home.

First of all...you're in Vegas, where money has lost all meaning and last week's paycheck looks like the next few poker chips. Naturally the ridiculously expensive food doesn't make things any better, especially if you're like my group of friends that likes to do (at least) one get-all-fancied-up dinner and a buffet or two. Plus that entire smorgasboard of alcohol everywhere...what's the point in paying 10+ for lunch? That could be your next double down. Or perhaps a last minute all-on-red. 

Now Earl's is a life-saver. It's great sandwiches...I mean delicious when you're non-alchied, and even delicious-er when you're nicely alchied up. I got the Montagu, roast beef, turkey, brie, mmmm. And it's all for less than 6 bucks!!! LESS THAN 6 BUCKS. I was so amazed. This is much better than blowing 30+ at Serendipitys for lunch. (They're great for dessert, not so much on food). It's right outside Planet Hollywood casino, which has Prive...one of the better clubs and sometimes decent tables. They were not so loving this last weekend though. 

Anyway, go to Earl's for hangover food. Go to Earls for lunch, go to Earl's for late night munchies, and go to Earl's to sit down and get all those gamblin' jitters out of your system before you go back and blow next week's paycheck too.",1,2,2

Granted that it's only a sandwich shop, the food is served fresh, warm, and tastes pretty damn good!

Earl of Sandwich is located in Planet Hollywood and normally there's a line but it goes pretty fast. Line = good sign for a restaurant. You order first and then pay at the end of the line (then they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready). There's limited seating space so you'll have to have a few of your friends lurk around and snatch a seat. But the best thing about Earl of Sandwich is that it's open 24 hrs 7 days!!!

So far I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken - Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce (there's a slight kick to it, but nothing no one can handle...and the roasted red\/banana peppers gives the sandwich a nice smokey flavor)

and

The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce (I gobbled everything up...can't go wrong with bacon...IT'S BACON!)

I believe all the signature sandwiches are priced at $6.99...and that's an automatic win in Vegas (especially if you lost at the casino tables). You can add soups, chips, drinks, dessert, etc to your order as well but the sandwich is pretty filling - at about 6"".",1,1,1

John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, apparently loved to gamble (nice we have a couple locations then huh?) and after playing 24 hours straight, he asked the cook to make him something easy to hold in one hand and eat and the other hand could be free to play cards. He was brought 2 pieces of bread with meat in between it. This is the story I got from the restaurant, seems maybe the cook actually invented it?! I first went to Earl of Sandwich in California at Downtown Disney and really enjoyed it so I was happy when we got an EOS! 

I can't believe it is only about $6 per sandwich! It tastes so fresh and yummy. I can easily eat just one and be full but my hubby does need 2 to get full. I like the ""Full Montagu"" which has  Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce. I have them hold the lettuce (just my personal preference).

If you are not a meat eater they have a couple sandwiches for you called the ""veggie"" and ""caprese"" and a variety of soups. I like the ""Wisconsin Cheddar"" for the soup it is really tasty.

The next thing I am going to try is one of their wraps. I do want to mention the line is sometimes very long but I promise you that it moves very quickly. You can even bring your own soda or stop at a gas station and get something if you wanted to save a bit and not pay for one of theirs.",5,1,3

After reading the reviews and standing in line for about 25-30 minutes, I was expecting some spectacular, mind boggling, better than sex kind of a sandwich but sorely, it didn't live up to the hype.

$3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.

So, it was a surprise to see such a highly rated joint at Miracle Mile. So, I ate from this restaurant twice during our stay here. The first time I had their Chipotle Chicken Avacado, and the second time we had the Full Montagu, Original Earl & Chipotle Chicken Avacado. 

The concept is pretty simple. All food is ordered to go!

Walk into Miracle Mile via the South Entrance. (Close to Rockbar)
Get into the short line into this sandwich place.
Place your order at the counter that has a hanging sign ""Order Here""
Pick any chips, cookies etc. and take your receipt to the counter that has a hanging sign ""Pay here""
Pay, and take your buzzer.
Fill up drinks etc. 
Once the buzzer goes off, pick your food up where the sign ""Pick-Up here"" hangs

There is seating at the restaurant itself where you could hang out and dine, or munch on the sandwich while walking the strip!

Pros:
Delicious Sandwich. All the sandwich's I tried were good. (+1)
$7.56 with tax on each sandwich. This is a bargain for the taste and the convenience! After devouring endless plates of meals at the buffet's, a sandwich portion of this size is light and refreshing!

Cons:
Few of their items are seasonal. Mrs. wanted to try their Caribbean jerk chicken, and I wanted to try their Meatball sandwich. Unfortunately, they were not available. (-1)

I will definitely hit this spot up during my future Vegas trips.",4,2,5

Haven't gotten around to trying all the sides (heard from friends they are good though), but the three sandwiches I tried were all excellent.  Sandwiches come out hot and are all made to order for only $5.99.  A deal anywhere including Vega$.  The toasted artisan bread combined with fresh ingredients make for tasty bite after tasty bite.

The Original is roasted beef, cheddar cheese and their own creamy horseradish sauce.  The roast beef tastes juicy and the horseradish sauce has a great tangy, not too hot combination.

The Italian is fresh tasting with juicy, ripe tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  The Italian dressing adds a nice zest to the salamis and ham.

Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of ""The worlds greatest hot Sandwich"".

The Beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, I know America likes their Beef still Moo'ing. No big deal yet then the Salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor.

He then went to on to tell me it was probably the best Turkey and Stuffing Sandwich he's got from a Sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.

Full Montagu and Caribbean Jerk

I always get the above two sandwiches whenever I am get to Earls. This place is a must go if you are looking for a relatively quick and cheap bite to eat that is affordable (5.99 each?)and tasty without overindulging at a buffet. 

All their sandwiches are great! It's definitely the bread that does it for me. 

Whenever visiting vegas I make it a point to have this as one of my meals, and I always buy an extra one for later munching after a night of fun or if I wake up before everyone and am too lazy to go out on my own. 

Their other little extras are good too, like the ice cream sandwich and the potato salad. But definitely go for the main entree, the sandwiches. 

Be aware that lines do get very long during weekends, mainly during meal hours of lunch and dinner. So be prepared to come at a different time or wait.

Sandwiches are truly bomb - from the perfect combination of fillings to the warm, toasted bread. Also it is quite affordable for Vegas at $6.99 for a decent portion.

Favorite so far is the chipotle chicken. Ugh. I love how they are generous with the avocado, and the slight sweetness of the chipotle sauce with the crunch of the bacon is ON point. 

Also tried the holiday turkey and the tuna melt, of which I liked the latter slightly better. Holiday turkey is literally turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing. Tuna melt is more savory, with a heaping amount of melted cheese. 

The tomato soup is also very delicious - super creamy. Be sure to get croutons in it!

Brief Summary
-- Delicious hot sandwiches
-- Open 24 hours
-- Almost always BUSY
-- Free samples if you're in the long line
-- Great poatoe salad

This place is cheap and easy just like Las Vegas! Well maybe its cheaper...

Basically you get in the long line and you get processed decently quick, depending on how many employees are there, etc.

I think I got ""Earl's Club"" or maybe it was ""Club of Earl""? Not sure.
It was turkey, bacon, subbed cheddar instead of swiss, lettuce, subbed onions instead of tomatoe on their bread roll with ""sandwich sauce.""

It was hot, fresh and delicious. 

I also got the poatoe salad, which was amazing and it was only $1.79!!
They have a lot of different sides, drinks, desserts and options.
I wish I would have tried something else but the Club was awesome both times.

My GF got the Full Montagu (sp?) both times and I tasted it, it was good. The 2nd time, the mustard was a little overbearing but it blended well with the roast beef.

I've been to EoS several times in Downtown Disney, but this past weekend was my first time at the Vegas location! 

By far, one of my favorite places to eat. Doesn't sound like much, right? Hot sandwiches? Glorified Subway? Oh but it so much more than that... the bread is crispy perfection, and I've never been disappointed by my sandwich. 

My boyfriend and I usually get the Chipotle chicken avocado and it is just so delicious. I think it's a good deal since sandwich places (I'm looking at you Subway) usually charge extra for avocado, but this sandwich is still the same price as the others (around $7 with tax). I recently tried Holiday Turkey (no mayo) and it was pretty good. I like my usual better but the stuffing and cranberry brought out the flavor of the turkey. I also like the tomato soup, because it comes with croutons. So creamy and complements my sandwich so well. 

One thing though is that they don't offer wheat bread like the Disney location... but then again, when I got wheat bread one time, it came out so burnt that my bf couldn't stop laughing. :( So maybe not a bad thing.

I shared the Earl's Club with my gf and the sandwich consisted of turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and the Earl special sauce. The sandwich was just OKAY. I think the bread was much tastier than the ingredients in the sandwich itself. The meats were nothing special. It sort of tasted like ordinary deli meat. I am quite particular with my sandwiches....If it uses turkey for instance, I actually expect soft tender chunks of turkey not really deli style. 

I also tried the Caprese sandwich and I think that one is my fave. Just because the ciabatta bread was so lusciously soft, it sits perfectly when mozzarella, tomato, basil, and balsamic vinaigrette are laid out in between. 

There is an array of baked goodies as you are getting closer to pay for your meal. It is pretty tempting, to buy, but I passed on those goodies.",1,1,1

i shared the full montagu sandwich and the meditteranean chicken salad.  first taste of the sandwich and i wanted to order another one!!  Mmm...  you need to try it for yourself.

it is a panini sandwich perfectly toasted.  freshly baked for your sandwich enjoyment.  one bite and you'll fall in love too.  seriously, if they had more locations...subway, quizno's, etc would become endangered species.

the meditteranean chicken salad was fresh and complimented the sandwich well.  all sandwiches and salads are $5.99 each.

The service was decent there, not too friendly but not a buncha douchebags either. i just wanted a sandwich, they just wanted to kill the line, we found a common ground.

the price was decent (don't expect too cheap in vegas anyways) and it got out fairly quickly. maybe due to the fact that i was admiring the line of beautiful girls that came a few minutes after us.

now as for the food, the sandwich was amazing. the bread was soft and warm, and the sweet cranberry sauce completed the stuffing and finished off with the turkey. i felt bad for not saying much to my friends cause i was too occupied eating my sandwich.

I went through an Earl's Club and a Cannonballs! sandwich during this trip in Vegas. If your on a budget this is your stop on the south Strip OR if you just want a great deal on some amazing food. Two people can dine for less than $20 but the line during peak ""dining"" hours can get a little outrageous so try to target some off peak visiting. 

This is the most western location of the chain sandwich shop with most locations located in Texas or Florida. They really nail the hot sandwich and go far above\/beyond a Subway type bite.

Finally, we drove to the strip and gave it a try.  It is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino (Las Vegas Boulevard & Harmon).  The Earl is near the Southern most entrance facing the Las Vegas Strip, right next to the Sugar Factory and the sports book.  The line was really long when we arrived and the seating appeared to be full.  I hate standing in line, but that is a good sign that they are doing something right.  Surprisingly, the line moved quickly.  The Earl is known for their hot sandwiches, we ordered two:  The Original 1762 is one of their signature hot sandwiches with roast beef, sharp cheddar, and creamy horseradish sauce on an artisan baked loaf.  I enjoyed the horseradish mayo.  The French Dip is only being served for a limited time.  It has roasted beef , sauteed red onions, on an artisan baked loaf and comes with Au Jus on the side.  I think they should have given a little more Au Jus.  We added a bowl of creamy tomato soup served with burnt croutons.  Cups of ice water are free.  Their bread is pretty good, but they are a bit stingy with the meat.  They slice the sandwich in half and the meat is clumped in the center giving the appearance that it has lots of meat.  Feels a little like false advertising.  The whole bill came in around $18.  By the time we got our food there was plenty of seating.  Apparently people move through pretty quickly.  The Earl is basically fast food like Quiznos or Panera Bread.  This place has a ton of reviews because it is one of the few places on the strip for tourists to get descent food at a low price.  I would eat there again if in the area, but it is not worth the hassle of the strip just for a sandwich.  Hey locals, there are far better options off the strip.

Nothing against toasted bread with butter one it- I would just prefer not to have the taste of my sandwich overcome with grease.

I got the Caprese Sandwich- tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar, oh, and a crap ton of butter. The flavors were overwhelmed with the butter, and really took away the great taste. Well, what should have been a great taste really. The tomatoes seem alright, but the basil was lacking and the cheese just didn't have the fresh mozzarella taste to it. My boyfriend had been here before and had the same problem; greasy sandwich, not so tasty ingredients, but we came back to try it anyways. Same thing really.

The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce

All American - Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Roma Tomatoes

Italian - Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato (Peppers Optional)

ALL THREE WERE SO SO GOOD! Well the Italian was a little salty (but go figure) and I don't really like cranberries in my sandwiches. But I ate it anyways. The bread is absolute divine. And there's enough sauce ratio that the sandwich isn't dry but it isn't soggy either. 

Earl of Sandwich was so good that before we left we cabbed it to PH and got some for the road. I ordered The Earl's Club again. And I had it on Monday actually (the other half). Popped it into the microwave for 1 minute. Still as delicious as when it was freshly made.

I did not like the sandwich I tried on my latest trip to Vegas at the PH location. I got the chipotle chicken avocado and it was small, flat, and very very dry. Honestly, it tasted like I was eating slightly flavored toast. And I don't even know what the flavor was; it wasn't chipotle, chicken, or avocado. It was so bad that I ate half and threw the other half away. That's saying something because if I can eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be sandwiches - I really love sandwiches - so imagine how bad it has to be for me to throw it away.

TL;DR: One of the BEST hot sandwiches I've ever tasted. My recommendations for hot sandwiches are the Hawaiian BBQ, Montagu, and the Caprese (not in any particular order). And do yourself a favor and go the extra mile with their tomato soup. 

Park in the Planet Hollywood\/Miracle Mile Shops parking. It might be a bit confusing to navigate to this restaurant (but then again, when is it easy in Vegas?)

It is very simple; it's more of a deli counter than a restaurant. Order food, pay, and wait. You look for your own seating, and clean up after yourself. 

As for your order, you can't go wrong with any of the hot sandwiches. The bread is hits the perfect ratios of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!!! The bread seriously makes all of these sandwiches. For specific orders, I've had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado (which was a LITTLE lacking in flavor) and the Caprese, which I highly recommend. My friends and family have recommended the Montagu and the Hawaiian BBQ. 

I also 90% recommend the tomato soup. So flavorful and perfectly complements the sandwiches. However, I docked off 10% because it gives me and my friends indigestion.... Maybe it's just us? This has happened on more than one separate occasion... Just a warning. I still order it anyways! :P

Not much to say about service other than it is quick even with a packed line and restaurant. Very efficient.",1,1,1

We were passing back through Vegas on our epic weekend in Utah, and we decided to spend a night in Vegas (believe me it was hard to leave the next day) the only request I had besides hitting up a buffet and laying out at the pool with a drink is to stop at Earl's and have a sandwich.

With that in mind, we all planned to hit this place up for lunch the next day! 

Earl is easy to locate, half in the PH casino\/half in the miracle mile mall. 
We arrived about 1:00ish and there was a small line, it moved fast which was good. Trying to decide on what to order became a picked as fast as possible which is never an option for me since I saw four sandwiches that interested me!

Their menu has plenty to pick from along with salads and wraps. 
Going on the more ""healthy"" route I picked a wrap, now which one to choose from (oh the choices).

A tiny part of me really wished they could have made the jerk chicken sandwich into a wrap, but they pretty much only can make salads into wraps (boo)! 

The cashiers are fast yet friendly. If you have a question, they are more than happy to answer it for you!

It was our turn and I placed my order:

The Earl's Cobb Wrap-grilled chicken, smoked bacon, Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, Roma tomatoes, cucumber, cranberries and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.

I opted not to have the swiss cheese (not a fan). 

Tossed in some BBQ kettle chips and I was good to go, Minh grabbed our number, and a drink and we were off to find a table. 

Did not take us too long to find a place for the four of us to sit at. Getting our sandwich and wrap did not take too long either.

Before I knew it, I had my much-awaited wrap sitting in front of me bagging to be open. I have to admit that i  had a ""Willy Wonka"" moment peeling back the golden paper. 

Sitting inside the golden paper was a delicious wrap filled with all the goodies; I could not take it anymore. I had to take a bite or two. 

Bite one... wow this is scrumdiddlyumptious! but oh no my chicken and lettuce fell out the back end of my wrap, the bf was super sweet to stop eating to go and get me a fork so I could eat what fell out. 

Bite two... I loved the cranberries in the wrap; it gave it a subtle sweet kick. The ranch was prefect in the amount they gave you.

And yes, there was plenty of chicken, cheese, and bacon with every bite!

The chips are good too, not to greasy but more of a lighter taste with a whole lot of flavor and crunch!

I left not feeling overly full, but just the right amount of being satisfied!

The line can get long here, but the service is pretty fast, and the fact that they supply you with those little thingy-ma-jiggy's that blinks red whenever your sandwich is ready to be picked up. I do love that they have a refill area for your soft drinks, it was a huge help for my thirsty self!

They actually have a large seating area, and also a wide variety of chips and dessert bites. Seriously though any of the sandwiches they offer are $5.99, and even though I only tried two of their sandwiches, I know that the others are just as bomb!

I had the Hawaiian sandwich, and oh my goodness. I remember first taking my bite into that sandwich, my eyes instantly closed and enjoyed each flavor. From the juice and sweetness from the pineapple, to the gooey but delicious cheese, the tender and salty taste from the ham, and to top it all off the crunch from the bread, its just a heavenly bite!

My girlfriend got the club sandwich, and seeing her reaction when she first bit into the sandwich, it was seriously a mirror image of myself but of her of course. Instead of Whoa which would come out of my mouth, my girlfriend yelled out BOMB! When I got to take my share of her sandwich, I dont blame her. The sandwich had many different textures from the crunch from the sandwich and the bacon, and also different flavors, salt from the bacon, the zing from the mustard it was simply amazing! 

Overall I plan on coming to Earl of Sandwich whenever I come to Vegas, it is a must! I cannot wait to try all the other sandwiches, because seriously being so far away and having my mouth water, im getting all jumpy just wanting to have some right now!

The sandwich was a good size-- about the size of a large Quizno's sub. The meat inside the sandwich was tasty-- especially the rolls of ham. They overwhelmed my sandwich with their Hawaiian BBQ sauce. They put about 2 tiny slices of pineapple in my sandwich-- not enough given the generous portions of ham.

it's not earl's fault that the miracle miles has the worst layout of all time, and an even worse ""you are here"" map, which led to even more risk of slipping and falling again as we wandered forever trying to find that wing it was stashed in.
we finally found it and for being a sandwich place i was kind of disappointed. there were maybe 8 options (versus a dilly's which is similar in price and order and pick up at counter style). really, all i wanted was a french dip (or meat on a bun with meat juice, as i affectionately refer to it and order when i am starving). but i settled on a tturkey, tomato and brie and their ""signature famous"" lemonade. the food took kind of while to finally be ready, and by then i was bruised, starving, pouting that they didn't have a simple sandwich staple and pissed that i finally had to *buy* a $16 pair of flip flops because i really feared i would fall again trying to find the damn place.
anyway, it was just ok, and about halfway through the most ear-piercing, loudest fucking siren went off right above our heads. the emergency lights started flashing and the sirens broke - briefly - for a robot voice to inform the stunned and deafened consumers that an alarm had been activated and the reason was being investigated. then back to the sirens! really? it was so loud i couldn't concentrate, let alone eat. we tossed the rest and got the eff out of there.
all the disaster aside, the food wasn't good, the lemonade was terrible, and the options were pretty bland -slapping brie on every other sandwich doesn't really make it unique or skyrocket your eatery out of subway level, people.",0,1,1

Hope everyone had a terrific NY celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  Now the New Year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!

Earl of Sandwich... I've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to Vegas by everyone I know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  On the day we were going to be leavin' LV I've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at Earl's.

Oh boy am I glad that I did just that!

You know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  However, here at Earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!

Again due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  I've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab I've set up in Bellagio.  (I end up getting the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and the Earl Cobb Salad.)  The sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)

I did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so I not really the pig that I say I am.....

So here were our thoughts...

Full Montagu:  Great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... So taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!

Hawaiian BBQ:  I didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so I'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  

Jamaican Jerk Chicken:  Jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  That's all I can tell you!  Yum!

Highlights of these sandwiches, the BREAD!  They toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  It's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  I've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and Earl of Sandwich really proved that to be the main point!

Earl Cobb:  Aside from having slightly too much dressing that I would have liked (I always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  I've have had many salads in various places, I gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  Definitely worth the price!  (The people I was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)

It's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)

One final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  WOW!  That's so awesome!  So you're telling me when I'm hungry late at night working on them slots, I can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  I Love Vegas!!!

So there you have it folks!  The first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  So again hope everyone will be having a SUPER DUPER 2011 and if you do visit Vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine\/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to Earl of Sandwich!",12,10,16

I had the Montagu (thanks Yelpers for the advice) and the hubby had the turkey club. We both killed our sandwiches - the sauces really added flavor, but it wasn't too overwhelming, rich, or salty. It was just the perfect blend of savory and spices.

Dessert tip: you MUST get the brownie sandwich (to eat there - you'll have room, trust me!) AND the $1.99 brownie to go for later. SOOO good, chewy and decadent and well-made. It's still fresh even after a day (and after a 1 hour flight). You can really taste the high quality (Ghiradelli chocolate).

The lines can get a little long at times, particularly at the end of peak clubbing\/drinking hours since they're open 24\/7(which is worth a bonus star in my opinion) and end up being one of a couple all night take out places midstrip. That being said the employees are usually friendly and efficient, and I've rarely had to wait more than about 10 minutes end-to-end. 

The selection is excellent if a tad unadventurous, I particularly like The Original and the Holiday Turkey sandwich. They have a standard array of sandwiches which I tend to enjoy as designed by default, the vegetables are not a selling point but the meat and sauces are quality and the flavors tend to be well selected and complimentary; the binary choice between white and wheat bread leaves something to be desired. I'm not sure if this is a recent development but they have added a number of pasta dishes to their menu, the one that I tried, the Bacon Mac-and-Cheese, was surprisingly tasty, and could easily pass as a side at a significantly more expensive venue were it to be re-plated. I've also tried the salads there and they're passable, but ultimately forgettable. If you're looking for a dedicated seating area, you're liable to be disappointed. 

For what it is, the EoS is a great stop for late night, or inexpensive anytime meals which are hard to find on the strip. If you want a consistent, known good, which is also filling, you should definitely give this place a try.",1,0,1

The lines are always long but it goes quickly and totally worth it. My favorites include Ham and cheese (classic), the full Montagu (meatlover's delight), and the Original (yummy roast beef!). I also tried the Meatball but it was just ok... Their salads are also good as well~mediterranean and chinese chicken salad are my favorite. I haven't tried their desserts but I heard they are good. I don't even like mustard but there is something about Earl's mustard that makes sandwiches magical! I wish I knew the secret! Their roast beef is really juicy and soft, it melts in your mouth!  This place is also a good place to people-watch. Lots of funny drunk people stumbling, munching like zombies, then passed out in a corner.

Also conveniently located next to Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile shops if you are staying there.

I had so much work to do on my computer and wanted something quick to take back to my hotel. 

The sandwich place is located in the Miracle Mile Mall inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. And this is one of the hottest businesses in Las Vegas. 

At 9:30pm, there was still a line with maybe fifteen people ahead of me. With so many places for a quick bite, I wasn't expecting a line; even at that time.  

Finally my turn and from the menu, I chose the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. Most sandwiches (excluding the extra topping) are $5.99. My sandwich comprises with a grilled chicken breast, sweet peppers, melted cheese and a spicy Caribbean sauce in a toasted roll. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=282xQYVko0N2D1VFHFB4qA

Sorry, I didn't find this sandwich or this chained franchise too impressive. But I would definitely choose this over Subway or Quizno's. The sandwich is good enough, but nothing too stunning. 

Maybe I'm spoiled because I live in the Bay Area and get better gourmet sandwiches such as Ike's place, Genova's or Roxie's. For a franchise, it's ok. 

If I have time to come back for a quick bite, I might try the Yogurt Parfait and pastries.

It's crazy how a sandwich consisting of only roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce practically changed my life. For 1 roast beef is my favorite sandwich meat, not to mention the slices Earl's uses is pretty thick. I was surprised because it was almost like they had cut it with a knife, thick enough that you could tell the meat was rare. I also love horseradish sauce, but theirs isn't overpowering the beef\/sandwich. The cheddar was very minimal, which is just how I like it since I am not a huge fan of cheese. I will probably be ordering the Original from now on, thank you!

It's a counter where you order your sandwiches and soups, then you go down the counter where they have bottled drinks, small deserts, potato chips, maccaroni salad, potato salad. You choose what you want and pay at the end of the counter where you pick up your sandwiches.

It's a great, great place!",4,3,4

First and foremost, I love that their soups are only $2.99.
I am a huge fan of tomato soups and they have a very good tomato soup with croutons.
EoS is generally a rather affordable food compared to nearly everything else on the strip.

Strangely enough, Kalila and I both wanted soup today. We went to Earl of Sandwich for some Broccoli Cheddar. It was a VERY HEAVY soup. It was good and tasty. I would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.

I had a full montague and it was delicious. I really liked the roast beef and the mustard.

Kalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. The sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. Overall, it was kind of dry. 

We like that the bread is toasted, but after reading Misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.

Based off of the other times Kalila has eaten there:
She highly recommends getting a tuna melt sandwich and a tomato soup. Eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!

OH, AND!
You can order a Grey Lemonade. It's Grey Iced tea and lemonade. Basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of iced tea. Whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. I know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. It is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. Just try it to see if you like it or not.

1. There is a parking structure that enters into the rear of the Miracle Mile Shops.

2. Earl of Sandwich is located near the entrance of the casino via Las Vegas Blvd.

3. If you're taking the walkway, the shop is on the first floor. There is no direct elevator down to the first floor from the second floor shops! Use the escalator. Walk past, til you see Pinks and go into the doors of Planet Hollywood.

Earl of Sandwich is one of our favorite stops in Vegas. The food is really great, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are really good--at least for Vegas. My favorite sandwich here is the Hawaiian Chicken. MAN the sauce is amazing on it and the pineapple slice along with the melted cheese is almost heavenly. Whenever my girlfriend and I come, we always order at least one Hawaiian Chicken sandwich.

We've also had the Earl Club, the Chipotle Chicken, and the Full Montagu. The first two sandwiches are good, though the Earl Club is a little too over the top with the sandwich sauce that they provide. It can get a little too messy and salty or it can be awesome and just right. The Chipotle Chicken is great too with a lovely chipotle sauce as well as avocados and bacon. The only thing we would not really recommend is the Full Montagu, just not as flavorful for us. The great thing about Earl of Sandwich is that their breads are toasted and rolled out of the machine on the spot. In fact you can watch them make your sandwich and roll it out on the grilling rack.

One of the things that I like is that even when the line is long, I can expect to wait maybe 10 minutes or so before ordering. The food is quick to come out as well. The only thing I would possibly say is an issue is that the service people may appear to be a little bit snippy when you're ordering a sandwich. This can be forgiven since I know that they deal with some fairly obnoxious guests that can be a little too drunk.

Anyways, the prices are what makes this place really special. Realistically, $6.49 (Hot) or $5.99 (cold) sandwiches would be nothing to go on about in LA or in any other city for that matter, especially when you consider that the size of the sandwiches are not gargantuan and may be even on the small side. However, being that it is 1. in Vegas and 2. in a casino, the prices that they set are pretty budget. I love this place just for the fact that my girlfriend and I can get full off of $20.

I just want to point out though that besides the sandwiches, we have also tried some desserts that they offer. My girlfriend swears by the chocolate brownie. I'm not a brownie person myself, but I can agree that it is rich and definitely chocolatey. Hope you guys can try it out for yourself!",0,0,1

That alone says a lot considering the overly inflated Vegas prices pretty much anywhere else you'll go. But you know what else is pretty cool? 

THE ORIGINAL 1762: Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese + Creamy Horseradish Sauce   http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RF2G1GIdQBuowR5CXppVkA

If it's called the original + it's the first thing on the menu, it's gotta be pretty good, right? And it was! ... I don't even like horseradish actually, but this sandwich was amazingly good. And yes, it was consumed not once but twice while somewhat relatively sober + so I know for sure that this sandwich is legitimately delicious with its thinly sliced moist meat, melty cheese... But what really makes the sandwiches here pop is actually the bread; a good sturdy roll that's toasted on the outside + soft on the inside but it's too thick that steals the show from the flavorful goods inside but rather complements them. 

Other perks to this place are that it's right on The Strip inside the Planet Hollywood hotel so you don't have to venture off to find a decent cheap meal + additionally, that it's located literally just yards from The Strip entrance at front of the hotel \/ the Miracle Mile shops. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=KT9yRyjLmgbbmm72dBq3dQ As someone who despises winding around for miles through casinos due to all the secondhand smoke, this location was the perfect pitstop for us + I'd imagine for any drunkies wandering The Strip as well since it's open 24 hours. 

Don't be afraid of the line out front http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=LjjLhCDPTnzkt5g1NmRQGA; it moves fairly fast + gives you time to deliberate over their multiple good-looking options. A couple of my friends tried The Full Montagu http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RX13gt95IhW9qnsPNwYN4Q + The Earl's Club as well + said they were really good as well. The sandwiches are about maybe 8"" long + they're cut in 1\/2 so it's perfect to share when you need sustenance but don't want to be full. They come wrapped tight + in a little plastic bag so it's easy to take to-go or to eat in their dine-in seating area. 

Doesn't get too much better than this any time of day or night when you're looking for legit cheap, good food on The Strip in Vegas. Yea, it's just a sandwich shop so take this review into context, but it's a pretty damn good shop. For sure I'll be back.... + maybe to try one of their yummy-looking Ghirardelli chocolate brownies by the register, mmm...   =)

I first visited Earl of Sandwich when vacationing at Disneyworld. We enjoyed it then as much as we do now.

I have tried many sandwiches and have loved them all just as much as the other, so I can't suggest just one. I have not tried the meatball or tuna, but their lunchmeat is good, cheese is great, and produce are the perfect accessories. Their bacon is cooked perfectly and they give generous amounts if ordered on a sandwich. The star for us in the toasted roll. The warmth of the sandwich is enough to melt the cheese a bit, but not to make the produce soggy- stays cold.

Taste is good but if I had to choose I would pick the Hawaiian BBQ. Chicken, ham, cheese, pineapple and bbq sauce goes really well together.  

The price for the sandwich is fairly priced but it's not that big of a sandwich.  Probably the size of a 6 inch sub.  They don't put a lot of meat inside as well.  It's more bread than meat for sure.  Some bites had nothing but bread.

I ordered the tuna melt with chicken tortilla soup and my bf ordered sthing else i forgot (sorry!) Although the tuna melt was delicious i just didnt think it was worth the 6bucks just b\/c it wasnt amazing in my opinion and for size was a lil much. even though yes it is a bargain for food on the strip...and 3bucks for barely a cup of soup? gees...and there was hardly any chicken in this soup...but! it did taste good, i just wouldnt get it again. the people there are rude or seem just tired out...im sure theyre sick of tourists but cmon now if im saying ""hello and thank you"" to you when you never said either of those to me first...yeah sthings wrong there.

another day later during this same recent trip to vegas, my bf and i went clubbing at tao..and of course i was one...drunk, two- tired as fuck, three- hungry...so we had to resort to earl's since it is in our hotel and its open @2am. these two black chicks in front of us came back from clubbing as well (and i know this b\/c when we girls are carrying our heels and walking around barefooted..its from clubbin')..the cashier was flirting with them and i was getting annoyed bc i was fucking tired, drunk & hungry...and here is this dude with his mini dreadlocks tryna spit game while myself and the line wrapping around the corner are tryna get our food! poor guy didnt get a 2nd look nor their #'s haha. so when we were finally next, we ordered one jerk chicken sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle soup. i know why did i order soup again? because for me it cures some of my drunkyness for an hr haha. plus i also wanted to see if another of their soup could redeem itself. jerk chicken was ok, wasnt amazing like some people had mentioned..i would say the red peppers helped that sandwich's ass out in making it taste at least good. soup was better than the tortilla soup surprisingly.

Well, maybe my opinion is skewed because I got a breakfast sandwich, which was not great at all.  The saving grace?  It was RIGHT next to our room and it was priced very very fairly.  

Food: I got the Bacon, egg, and Swiss breakfast sandwich.   It was early in the morning and we had all been drinking. The sandwich came out PIPING hot. I thought that I was going to bite into it and be struck with inspiration to go and do something with my life.  All I got was a mediocre ""ehhhh"".  I mean don't get me wrong, would I go out and get it again?  Yup, since it's so convenient.  I like my bacon crispy.  It wasn't crispy.  I guess I just had unreal expectations from yelp reviews.  

Price:  This probably earned the 3 stars rather than the 2 stars.  I think that it was VERY VERY reasonable.  After losing 90 bucks the night before, the last thing I wanted to do was shell out another 12 bucks for a breakfast sandwich.

This location inside Planet Hollywood looks great. Even got all the Earls of Sandwich on one of the walls. Larger portrait for the actual guy responsible for creating the sandwich. I guess we can all thank him now for being such a gambling addict.

Earl of Sandwich makes their own artisan bread, basically amounting to a buttery sandwich roll that lightly toasts in their conveyor-belt oven. Each sandwich is made and toasted to order.

I had one of the signature sandwiches: the Full Montagu ($6.49). Juicy, tender slices of meat, mustard, lettuce, and tomato. The lettuce looked a bit wilted, not sure if that was from it going through the oven. Added some Grey Poupon just for the hell of it.

Frankly, the sandwich was small for the amount paid. Merely a snack in my eyes.

There are usually a couple different types of coffee, a Kona blend and a dark roast. Good coffee here, and you can help yourself for a couple bucks.

The process is simple really. You go up and order your sandwiches and they give you a buzzer. Then you get in line to get your sandwiches. While you're in line, you pick up beer, chips and desserts if you choose. Once you're at the end, you pay for everything. By the time you pay, your buzzer gives you the signal and your sandwiches are ready!

The Caribbean Jerk Chicken had some pretty tender, juicy pieces of chicken inside stuffed with red and banana peppers inside. There's a spicy jerk spread they put in there which gave it a very subtle kick. My advice would be to eat your sandwich right away.

I tried the ham egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich. Pretty good. I like the bread they use. 
Also tried the Full Montague. It was alright. Although I didn't try it fresh\/hot because I ordered it to pack for a hiking lunch so by the time I ate it it was cold. It was good, but not as amazing I thought it would be considering people speak of it so highly. 

Tried the sugar cookie. THREE dollars. Not cheap. Their baked goods aren't cheap. The sugar cookie is good but super oily- I felt so guilty after I read it. 
Red velvet cupcake is good but not amazing. 

The tomato soup is good and comes with croutons. Again- good but not the best tomato soup I've ever had. Chicken noodle soup is...okay.

The second time I came here, the line was so long that I thought for sure it would take me at least 30 minutes to get to the register and order.

The food didn't quite blow me away, but it was still pretty good. Definitely better than Subway, Quiznos, etc. I have tried the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. I felt that they were stingy with the turkey in the Club. I had maybe 2 thin slices in my sandwich. Unfortunately, you don't have a choice for your bread. It would be nice to have other options like wheat or cheese. But, the white bread was good enough - fresh and crispy on the outside.

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad in a wrap (you can get any of the salads in a wrap).  It was so much better than other Greek style wraps I have had. Firstly the wrap itself was nice and thick and full of flavor, not just one of those boring tortilla wraps a lot of sandwich shops use. Secondly, they were very liberal with the kalamata olives and the roasted red peppers - usually I find that budget friendly places skimp on those kinds of ingredients. 

My friend ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and creamy tomato soup.  The bread on the sandwich was really, really good! It was thick and hearty with lots of flavor, and slightly toasted - loads better than anything you could find at Quizno's or Slobway.....  The tomato soup was delicious. I was hesitant to try it because they add croutons to it before serving, so I thought it would be a soggy mess....I was wrong!

It's located in PLANET HOLLYWOOD, right on the strip. It's kind've a mall food court type of atmosphere. Long SUBWAY type make-line, big dining area.


=========
THE SUBS
=========

~ EARL'S CLUB - Turkey, bacon, Swiss, sandwich sauce, lettuce & tomato. This was really amazing and out of the 5+ sandwiches I've tried... it was definitely the best. (5\/5)

~ CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO - Grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. I tried this my first time there back in December. The FULL MONTAGUE was disappointing and while sitting there I saw this had avocado, chipotle sauce and bacon... some of my favorite things. It was really good. (4\/5)

~ ITALIAN - Salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato & Italian dressing. This looks pretty simple and there's not of a ""sandwich"" taste since there's not many veggies... but the meats and cheese a delicious. Fattening but delicious. (4\/5)

~ CHICKEN PESTO POMODORO - Grilled chicken, Swiss cheese, tomato, basil pesto and basil leaves. It was a WINTER SEASONAL limited time advertised sub when I went in April of 2013. It was pretty good. (4\/5)

~ THE FULL MONTAGUE - Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. According to YELP, this was their best sandwich. It was good, but just not really for me. (3\/5)

~ BROWNIE - This was pretty subpar. It was a brownie. Not good, not terrible... not worth it. (2\/5)

~ CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE -  It was pretty disgusting. Took one bite, putrid. Tried a second bite... tossed it. (1\/5)

===============
FINAL THOUGHTS
===============

All-in-all this place is a 3 STARS. The subs are good but only 6-inches and for $6-each... it's a bit pricey. HOWEVER it's Vegas where $6.00 is a deal... so it gets a bonus point for that. All of their sandwiches are pretty good, haven't had a bad one yet. Plus all their sandwiches are hot ones. Do I prefer SUBWAY over this place. Sure... but it's still pretty good.

Last off stay away from the sides \/ snacks, they're terrible. And $6 for a 12oz bottle of Blue Moon? Walk down about 100 yards to the store that sells the souvenirs and alcohol and you can get a 22oz GIANT Blue Moon for $3.50.

The sandwiches here are damn good, especially for only $6.99!  It's actually quite surprising that the prices are so reasonable, since everything in Vegas is over priced.  The first time I ate here was back in 2012, and I did not have any expectations at all because I was hungover and hungry.  What better than a good sammy in your tummy after a long night of drinking?  

Earl of Sandwich is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel, which is conveniently next door to Paris, and it is also right across the street from the Cosmo where I used to stay frequently. Earl is very popular and the line can get a little long here during peak hours, but their ordering system is efficient and they are quick to deliver your food.  The two sammy's that I like are the Earl's Club or the Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich.  The warm bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just like it should be, and all of the ingredients are fresh.  If you think about it, everything has to be fresh, since they probably sell hundreds of sandwiches per day since they are open 24\/7.

The only downside is that the sandwiches are a bit too short for my liking. However, that may be because I liked it so much and it was gone in 2 minutes. I had to stand in line for another one. :-P.

Thank you for always satisfying my hunger, whether it may be late at night after dancing all night at a nighclub or early in the morning before heading home. I know I can always count on you for being so warm and delicious, made perfect for my hungry stomach-not too big or small and not too greasy or plain. I love your #1 original, but heard your other masterpieces are great as well.

This is a fantastic deal for a quick bite to eat, quick service and delicious sandwiches.

Since I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.

I went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.

The Full Montigue and Italian are my favorites, but everything on the menu is worth trying. Every sandwich is served hot and the bread, cheese, and meat seem to melt into one delicious bite that cant be beat.

Sometimes the line can get long, so yes I still recommend ordering ahead (I am a huge fan of ordering ahead anywhere lol).

I'll go to Leatherby's and order a sandwich.  I'll pretty much order a sandwich anywhere that offers sandwiches.  So with that said here I go...

I ordered two sandwiches.  1 Original 1762 and 1 Italian.  

Original 1762 - comes with roasted beef, cheddar cheese and creamy horseradish sauce.  I really enjoyed this sandwich.  The horseradish was the only thing I was hesitant about.  It turned out very light and a good accompaniment to the sandwich.  The roast beef was good but had a few chewy fat pieces that were hard to eat. 

Italian - Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato.  Sounds good right?  Who doesn't enjoy those deliciously salty meats?!?  Too bad they weren't real Italian meats.  More like the processed, packaged sandwich meat you'd find in the grocery store (not the deli).  The tomato was wrapped in the meat which didn't affect the taste but was strange in my opinion.  The best thing about this sandwich was the mustard.  I really like their mustard.  Very flavorful but not overpowering.

Overall I liked the Original sandwich the best.  The Italian sandwich just was okay and not what I expected.  Both sandwiches were nicely crisped and toasted.  The sandwiches are cheap but there really isn't much to them other than a couple pieces of meat, cheese and bread.  These are simple toasted sandwiches.  It's worth trying while visiting Las Vegas.  Next time I'll definitely stop by and have another sandwich.  Yum!",0,0,0

Las Vegas is full of overpriced restaurants and you pay a premium for everything from pizza to coffee. It's nice to find a place on the Strip that has very fair priced sandwiches that are also delicious. All the sandwiches are priced $5.99. I actually have to say this was one of the best sandwiches I've had. The secret is in the bread. All their bread rolls are same for all their sandwiches and I'm not sure what kind it is, but it tasted almost biscuit-like. I got the Caribbean Jerk chicken sandwich, which had great flavor with tender chicken and also the banana peppers. The Full Montagu and the Original were also quite tasty. Everything came toasty and hot and why shouldn't it? They advertise their sandwiches as the world's best hot sandwich. A hot sandwich makes all the difference sometimes (actually the bread also makes all the difference). And hey, how can you argue with someone whose family has been making sandwiches for 250 years?

On our last day of Vegas, we decided to eat at this restaurant. It's located in the Planet Hollywood shopping mall. We literally spent an hour trying to find this place since we thought it was located in MGM Grand, New York New York, or Monte Carlo. 

The sandwiches are really delicious! I love how the bread is toasted. MmMm..We had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Original. The jerk chicken sandwich had some sweetness to it due to the jerk sauce and the roasted red peppers. It wasn't spicy. I was actually surprised with the Original sandwich. I'm not usually a fan of roast beef with horseradish sauce, but the flavors worked well. The horseradish wasn't overpowering.  The sandwiches were $5-$6, so it is definitely a cheap eats.",0,0,0

It is hard to explain in words just how fantastic these sanwiches are.  At first look, you might think it is just another Quiznos analog, or taste like any other toasted sub.  Quite the contrary.   They make all of their own bread, but unlike Subway who bakes their bread fresh,.. Earl of sandwich only bakes their bread partially.  The partially baked loaves are set aside, and wait for you to order.  Then the sandwich is assembled with high end, fresh and flavorful ingredients and sauces, and put through the chain oven.  It is at this time that the loaf of bread is fully, and freshly baked.  This leaves you with a perfectly light and fluffy, fresh baked bread that just can't be beat.  Its like bread straight out of the oven at home, and the corner stone of this amazing sandwich.

   Between myself, my wife, and freinds and family we have brought here,.. we have collectively tried just about every sandwich on the menu.  The general consensus is, "" this is the best sandwich I have ever eaten"".  
  The portion is just about right.  Nothing is included, so if you want chips, drink or dessert, you may grab them on the way to check out.   They have a nice variety of fresh fruit, salad, chips and cookies.  Then the standard soda fountain, self serve.
   It is now open 24 hours, and though we have tried to beat the crowds by coming in late, there always seems to be a bunch of people eating there.  They do now have vibrating coaster pagers now.

The first time I had one was in Walt Disney World on my friend's recommendation. I was not disappointed!
Whenever I'm in Vegas and I'm just looking for something quick to eat at lunch before stuffing myself at the buffet for dinner, I'll always think Earl of Sandwich.
The line at this location can get long at times, but it goes by pretty quickly. It's located right across from sportsbook inside the PH.
My go-to sandwiches are the Holiday Turkey and The Original 1762.
I've had the Full Montague as well, but it didn't really stand out for me. Wasn't bad, but just didn't feel like this was one of their specialties.
If you're going to try Earl's for the first time, start with The Original. If you're hooked, start working your way down the list.
Include a drink, and your total should still be under $10.

Make sure to eat the sandwich while it's still piping hot. You would be ruining the experience otherwise.",0,0,0

There was barely enough tuna on my sandwich to give it even a slight tuna flavor.  The bread was the main thing I tasted.  Definately not the double-layer of tuna depicted on their website.  For $6.49, I felt I was overcharged.  

To top it off, when I was done, I showed the photo of the tuna melt from their website to the Manager (Marc).  He said ""they sure make it look big on the website, obviously they're making it look like a lot more than it is"".  He then simply offered me a ""sorry boss"" and then turned and walked away, no offer to remake my sandwich, refund my money, maybe comp me a brownie or anything.  Left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Oh, and to top it off, they were repairing the floors in the seating area, and the workers were using blowtorches to heat up the vinyl flooring (looks like wood, but it's vinyl).

Besides the fact that this place stays open 24\/7 (which I know is not uncommon in Vegas) they always hit the spot. Doesn't matter if its 5am after the club or 2pm for lunch. This last trip to Vegas I think we ate here for almost every meal and I never got sick of it. I'll break down the sandwiches I got. 

Earls Club - this one is my personal favorite. It sounds basic but everything in it just works so well together and it was refreshing and juicy compared to the others. After a harsh night or partying this one was a nice pick-me-up. 

The Original - this one had roast beef and like a horse radish cream sauce. This was pretty good but could have used a little more of the horse radish sauce as it got a little dry towards the end but the roast beef was cooked perfectly. 

Holiday Turkey - this one is seasonal I believe but I wish it was year round. This one was amazing! I love making left over turkey sandwiches after Thanksgiving and this one was almost spot on but with better bread then I use (their bread is fresh baked and the perfect blend of soft yet sturdy). 

Cannonballs - this is their meatball sandwich and this was awesome as well. It just works perfectly with their fresh baked bread and the sauce they use is legit. 

Caribbean Jerk Chicken - my friend loved this one and got it several times. We even stopped on the way to parking garage just to handle the craving for the road. I didn't try it but he raved on and on about it and I plan on trying it next. Maybe the Anaheim location? 

Their desserts are also pretty good. We got the red velvet cupcake and the brownie bites. 

Check this spot out! Even if the line looks long don't be scared, it moves pretty quick and the workers were very friendly too. I wish they had more locations in So Cal.",0,0,0

Take a moment to let that sink in. 

A trip planned around a sandwich shop. 

I don't think I need to go into any more detail, but for the sake of a solid yelp review here it goes. Every sandwich is incredible but the Holiday Turkey will forever be my favorite. In one weekend, I ate five of them and I have no regrets. Even though that's my favorite, everything on the menu is delicious. I've also tried the soups and they're great to dip your sandwiches into as well. 

Moral of the story: this restaurant is the best thing to exist in Las Vegas and if you don't get a sandwich here you aren't truly living.

So after this past Vegas trip for spring break with the girls we ended up staying at Planet Hollywood for a week.

Let me just say that for a week of staying here, me and my girlfriend ate here 5x in a row and made sure to buy 3 sandwiches before we headed back home to Hawaii. I've only tried the tuna melt because everything else sounded delicious but it contained meat in them (I'm a pescinarian). For about $7.00 a sandwich which is a huge and incredibly delicious sandwich it'll leave you tummy full, your mouth happy and you wanting and craving for more. 

I like that the workers are very fast in making the sandwiches, they line does look long but it moves pretty fast. They do have a small dining area but we only did takeout so we could bring it back upstairs to our room. I like the fact that they only use one type of bread which is good so it doesn't leave you with thoughts of ""what bread should I get"" ""Will this bread be good"". It's perfectly toasted to perfection and the tuna and Swiss cheese just blends so well in the sandwich...*so simple but good*.

At first, I was getting frustrated trying to find this place in  Planet Hollywood, but it was definitely worth the search. It's cheap, filling, and extremely good!

I went to Las Vegas this past month and tried earl of sandwich for my very first time. I can't believe I was missing out on such an amazing sandwich! 

Before I thought, ""it's just a sandwich"", I mean  how good can a sandwich possibly get? This, my dear, is as good as it gets. I'm sure this place steals pieces of heaven to put in their sandwich. 

I've only gone here twice throughout the duration of my stay in Vegas and the sandwiches I tried were the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. These are both winners in my book. 

I don't know how they do it but they put just the right amount of everything in these sandwiches. At first I thought the meat makes the sandwich or maybe a secret sauce but now I'm positive it's all in the bread. I may be mistaken but I think I had read somewhere that they don't bake the bread until you order it. Is it possible to bake bread that quickly?

Earl of Sandwich is a great place to grab a bite and it's significantly cheaper than most places on the strip not to mention probably better for your health-wise. The only down fall is that the location is sort of small, but they offer more tables over towards the mall side.

According to legend, he was an avid poker player, and he would not allow the simple inconvenience of hunger stop him from playing cards. Thus, he ordered the chef to put a steak between to pieces of bread so he could hold it with one hand, and his cards in the other... the sandwich was born.

So one my favorite food is of courses sandwiches, and this fact gets me very excited whenever I go to check out a sandwich I haven't been to.

The only things that keeps me from giving them a stellar 5 star review is the fact that the sandwiches seem kind of small, I could easily eat 2 of them. At about $7-8 per sammich, I do expect more.

(I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)

The tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...

... at 8:30am.

Yeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.

What to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.

Did I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?

Have I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas.",11,8,11

It's counter service style. Employees were very friendly considering the shift they were working. Service was super quick. 

I ordered the pizza bread which was more like an individual  square deep dish cheese pizza. It was amazing!

The only thing that made me sad about Earl of Sandwich was that I waited in the huge, long line through Planet Hollywood, dreaming of the Italian sandwich I was about to eat (made with salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato and Italian dressing), only to discover that they were out of these ingredients and couldn't make me one. At the last minute, I went with the plain and simple ham 'n swiss ($6.99).

I wasn't sad for long, though, because the service was very efficient, and the sandwich was amazing. The ham was warm, the cheese was melty, and the bread was crisp and hearty. The ham 'n swiss is simple but so, so effective.

I don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like McDonald's or Subway.  Speaking of Subway, Earl's is nothing like Subway or Quiznos for that matter.  I was somewhat expecting Earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, Earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  Earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  I promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any VP of Operations proud.

When a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed.  Mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.

Because of all the hype, I took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so I promptly ordered the Original roast beef, the Earl's Club, the Italian and the Jerk Chicken along with a brownie, a Blue Moon Beer and a Coke.  Before you start pondering what a complete pig I am, I shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1\/4 sandwich each.  This was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix Earl's sampling if you would.

On to the actual sandwiches. 

The Original was superb.  The roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  It was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich I had at Quiznos just a few weeks before. The Club was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and tomatoes.  The Italian wasn't my favorite with its Pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, I guess I'm not a big fan of Pastrami.  For me, the star of the show was the Jerk Chicken.  The chicken was moist and the Jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  The thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  Only one kind of bread is served at Earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  If you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then Earl's should be your sandwich Mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.

Hmmmm, I seem to have written too much....I doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, I'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  I guess I'll just summerize Earl's in one last line.  If you haven't tried Earl Of Sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star Yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.",1,0,0

We stopped here for our last bite before leaving Vegas. While walking through the (boring) Miracle Mile shops of Planet Hollywood the day before, the name of this place caught our attention. Vlad is the sandwich lover in this relationship, so I knew we were going to have to try this place eventually. 

First of all, the deli-style ordering is great if you want to grab a quick bite without the wait service. I also like that once you order, they give you a pager that vibrates when your order is ready, which keeps the line moving instead of having to impatiently wait at the counter or listen for your order number. 

Vlad ordered one of the signature sandwiches with their homemade artisan bread, which looked like some warm carby deliciousness. He loved it. I ordered a flatbread wrap - delicious. The actual flatbread tasted unlike any other flatbread I've had before. Not too tortilla-like, not to bread-like. It was like really really thin, fresh pizza dough.

On to Earl. No, it is not over-hyped. Yes, there is a line that loops around the shop. Located in Planet Hollywood Mall area, Earl stands out. Earl has a variety of sandwiches. Earl is affordable. Sandwiches range around $7-8 with tax. Soda fountain for those who crave sugar and diabetes, and free H2O. 

Earl and I get a long quite well. I loved the Tuna Melt -- t'is my favorite sandwich. Bread crisp on the outside soft in the inside, great bite and texture. Cannot tell whether or not the tuna is canned, because there are actual chunks of tuna with a generous serving of mayo. The melting cheese is perfect, no complaints. It is a great option for lunch if you don't want to break your wallet at the buffets or expensive tourist prices at other venues. Definitely a must if you are in Vegas. Tip: It is at the east end of the mall, across the casino (so you don't have to walk in big circle). My friends enjoy this so much, they even pack it back to California.

It is inside Planet Hollywood. The mall itself is nice, especially early in the morning when Vegas sleeps and you can window shop. 

I ordered the Italian, which is loaded with meat. It was delicious. One of my fondest memories is eating pizza grinders from a neighborhood joint, and Earl of Sandwich brought those wonderful memories back. Admittedly, the sandwich was small and I have suspicions the bread could be better, but somehow it came together in my mouth quite perfectly. The meats are really tasty and the cheese is a good balancing flavor. 

My man ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. It looked nasty and I think he made a comment about the egg looking janky. He thought it was just ok. 

The broccoli cheddar soup was not good. I expect a hearty, chicken based broccoli cheddar flavor. The Earl's tasted of fake cheese and the texture was off. Would definitely pass next time.

There is nothing fancy or Vegas like about this cafeteria style Sammie spot,  no crazy menu, no neon lights, not even girls in skimpy outfits lol.  Earl of Sandwich does deliver some great tasty Sammies for a cheap $6.99.  We ordered the Tuna Melt which was perfection, light soft crispy bread with gooey Swiss and tuna salad.  I coul eat this Sammie everyday of the week.  We also tried the roast beef Sammie which was named the 1762 or something close to that.  The beef was so tender it literally melted in our mouths. The cheddar cheese and sweet spicy horseradish sauce complimented the tender beef perfectly.

Earl of Sandwich offers several specialty sandwiches, all toasted on their famous artisan bread. When I first approached Earl of Sandwich, the line was wrapped around the corner, and I cringed, thinking I would have to wait an eternity before I could get my hands on one of their tasty sandwiches. 

To my surprise, the line went by quite quickly, and we got our food order within 10 minutes. Not too shabby, especially with the mob that was surrounding the place.  

Highlights:

Club: Turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato, sandwich sauce. subbed out sauce for their house mustard which is a mix of dijon and honey mustard. The sandwich was just plain good. The bacon was not too fatty and it added the perfect smokiness to the turkey. The crunch of the bread mixed with the meat and veggies was a pure delight! This was my favorite sandwich of the day. 

Montagu: Turkey, Roast beef, lettuce, tomato, house mustard. I liked this sandwich too. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat, and again it all kind of worked together. 

Italian: This was also very good. Typically, italian sandwiches (i.e. grinders) are way too salty for me because of all the different types of meat (which all tend to be on the salty side) To my surprise, the warm sandwich really hit the spot for me without making me run for a glass of water to wash down all the sodium. 

Ham Egg and Cheddar breakfast sandwich- I thought this breakfast sandwich was just ok. I definitely think that the other specialty sandwiches are better deal in price and in flavor. It was kinda bland, and I needed my special hot sauce to give it a zing. ($3.99)

Earl of Sandwich was so good, that I went there TWICE in one visit (especially with all the good places vegas has to offer). It's definitely a good alternative if you're trying to stay on budget, without sacrificing flavor.

A must-stop place when you're in Vegas, Earl of Sandwiches always hits the spot for the out-of-towner, the Vegas clubber, the in-between buffet meals hungerer, the easy to-go meal poolside eater---everything you can think of. 

Their hot signature sandwiches are the heart of the menu. As every parent claims they ""don't have a favorite child,"" that is how I feel about Earl of Sandwich! I swear their hot sandwiches are equally delicious. I've tried the Earl's Club, The Original 1762, The Full Montagu and the Caprese Sandwich and love them all. With every bite, the bread is warm, crunchy but soft, cheese is perfectly melted, perfect balance of meat\/cheese\/veggies. (If I HAD to choose, I like the Earl's Club tad bit more) 

It's really all about their fresh ingredients and TLC they put in their sandwiches. All their hot sandwiches are made to order from scratch using high quality fresh ingredients and served on their own artisan baked loaf and topped with unique sauces and spreads. Their Angus beef is slow roasted in-house and freshly carved.

I had heard good things about it from friends, and had read lots of great Yelp reviews, so I was exciting to give it a try this past weekend when visiting Las Vegas.  

My initial impression of the food was not good.  I was let down by the fact that my bread was pretty badly burnt on one side.  I had taken my food to go, and did not make the discovery of my bread being burnt until I got back to my room.  However, even with the sandwich being burnt, it was still decent.  Besides being burnt, the flavor of the other ingredients really stood out.  I had ordered the 'The Original', which is a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  After feeling like I missed out on something good, I decided to go back to the Earl of Sandwich the next day to give it another shot.  I ordered the same sandwich again, and it was so much better with the bread being slightly toasted.  I also got a potato salad, and liked that as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty meal.

Great breakfast sandwiches.  The BLT, which I haven't had in over 20 years, was great.  I had two of them in two days.  The wife and child liked their ham and cheese sandwiches.  The breakfast sandwiches are only $3.99.  You cannot get a better deal for breakfast.   

I should have gotten my coffee here instead of Starbucks and the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf where it costs over $4 for a cup of coffee.  Here at the Earl of Sandwich, it was only $1.99!

I got back 2 weeks ago.. and went to Vegas for the weekend with the family, and I knew this would be a great opportunity to rack up some Yelp reviews to make up for lost time!!

So I drove in and went to the coveted Earl of Sandwich.. 

This place is as good as they say! I tried 4 sandwiches and a soup thanks to my family, and we each got:

Caribbean Jerk Chicken: mine! This was really good and spicy, with banana peppers and nicely grilled chicken. Twas delicious.
The Original: My mom\/dad split this one..  we all really liked it as we exchanged sandwiches (benefits of having a family that loves variety :P) Good roast beef! And the Original is a solid choice...No wonder why this place became so popular! 
The Full Montagu: My sister got this one.. and we all agreed that it was our favorite out of the 3... It had turkey? And Roast beef... and cheese with lettuce.. Delicious.
Tomato soup: It was like gourmet Spaghetti-Os... It was ok and had croutons, but I don't remember how much it was... I'd rather have gotten another sandwich.

My sister and I went for a second round...So we got:

The Italian. This is by far our most favorite sandwich. This is the reason why you need to come here. I learned that Mortadello was Italian bologna, and it came with mozzarella, tomato, and it was good, good, goooooOOOood!!!

Oh, and the Earl Grey Lemonade needs sugar. Nothing 4 Splenda's can't fix. Or you could just get a pink lemonade too.. 

There's so much I wanted to try too! The Meatball, Hawaiian Chicken, etc etc..

Hardly.

If you truly believe that, then you've never eaten at Ike's in San Francisco. (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ikes-place-san-francisco)

Ike's Dutch Crunch bread puts Earl's ""artisan"" bread to shame and while I would love to go off on the variety of sandwiches Ike's has compared to Earl's, and the fact that the Ike's Dirty Sauce just kills everything else Earls could even offer, I won't.

Is it fair to compare the two? Well, when you have a tag line like ""The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich""... well you better have the-worlds-greatest-hot-sandwich. 

I tried 3 different sandwiches just to get a grasp of what they were doing:

Full Montague - nothing special
Italian - my favorite of the 3, but it's hard to go wrong with salami, capicola, mozzarella, etc.
Caribbean Jerk Chicken - not a fan of this flavor profile

Actually, my favorite thing they had there was what I pulled out of the freezer... the Brownie Cream Pie. I'm not a dessert person, but the brownie was rich without being too sweet and went well with the ice cream. 

I guess you could say this review is a hype vs reality thing. I don't know if everyone is just so drunk and hung over that their taste buds are out of whack or, the fact that the shape and wrapper give everyone the illusion that they are about to eat something ""golden"", but realize this sandwich is just a small step up from Quizno's...

-Jerk Chicken: I actually thought this wasn't too bad though my fiancee didn't particularly enjoy this one.  The bell peppers and peppercinis gave it a nice fresh feel, though it's not quite ""jerk"" as you would expect.

Not bad, I'd go again.",0,0,0

Honestly, I could just eat the bread all day. The salad was also pretty good, but if I had to do it again, I'd just order another sandwich.

Practically all the ones i tried was pretty good. But my favorite would still have to be the Turkey\/Bacon Sandwich. Okay guys, I must cut this review short. I'm gonna drive to Vegas right now on a mission for some heavenly sandwiches, bye!!!",2,1,1

Seems odd, but if you consider the fact that they're open 24 hours, have mouth watering sandwiches for cheap, and that they're located at a convenient location on the strip, it's not hard to believe. 

My favorite sandwich is the thanksgiving turkey! It's seriously amazing, especially if you ask them for more of the cranberry sauce and douse the entire thing in it. It's so good that I had it three days in a row when I was staying at ph. 

All their sandwiches are top notch though, my second favorite is probably the full montagu. The bread is made to perfection on all hot sandwiches.

They offer salads and wraps as well if you're in a healthier mode. As a side I like the macaroni salad or a soup. For dessert they have this brownie ice cream sandwich that is wonderful. It's probably best to share between two people though cuz it can get overwhelming. 

They also sell beer - it's not Vegas without alcohol! Lines can get long but it moves quickly. They have a good system going to take orders and have food ready in a snap. Plenty of seating inside as well. 

Definitely will continue coming when in town!",0,0,0

Salad - 4 stars (yay!)
Sammnich - 3 stars (ok...)

Located in planet hollywood, just on the outskirts of the miracle mile shop, this place was poppin!  I mean, at a couple separate times, the line wrapped around the eatery.  However, the line does move quickly, but not quick enough for me to lose $10 on the Batman: Dark Knight  slots machines (crap!).  The first day, I was too hung over to eat anything filling so I opted for the cobb salad.  A decent portion size, all of the ingredients tasted fresh.  Although the chicken was moist and lightly seasoned, I kinda wished there was less chicken and more lettuce.  There was enough for me to bring a bit back to the hotel room and snack on it later...

The next day, I was in search for more food, specifically soup, and found my way back to Earl.  I saw a picture of the holiday sandwich while waiting in line and thought, ""Hey, I like turkey, gravy, and stuffing, why not?""  I ordered the holiday sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup to satisfy my inner fat kid.  Ah, soup...  I'm a soup junkie.  When my boyfriend is sick, I think of chicken noodle soup and end up eating it all myself.  The soup at Earl's was very tasty.  The soup was nice and thick with lots of melted cheddar and the broccoli was nice and soft and melt in your mouth style.  The only downside was the portion size is too small, but what do you expect for $2.99?  Now the sandwich...  I don't know, maybe I had higher expectations of thanksgiving dinner to go, but I was thoroughly disappointed.  1. they forgot my cranberries, 2. definitely not enough gravy, no no cranberries and small amount of gravy equals dry sammnich , and 3. the meat was uber salty!  As you can see, everything led to a dry, salty sandwich which did not go so well for someone who is already dehydrated from binge drinking the night before.  I managed to get half the sandwich down and all the soup, but it proved futile when I literally vomited to food back up in the hotel room, literally 15 minutes later.  (yayy cause there goes all the calories I just ingested, and no I don't have an eating disorder).

I've personally never been to Earl of Sandwich.  While the idea that there was once a mythical Earl of a place called Sandwich is up for debate (and probably debunked) but none the less, I had to try it from all the people that recommended it.

The best way to describe Earl's is what would happen if you took Arbys, made it good, and then added a selection like Panera Bread.  I didn't really feel adventurous so I just ordered the ""Original"".  Basically it was roast beef, with horseradish sauce and cheese.

They make it fresh to order and nice and hot so I was pretty excited.  After taking a couple bites, you start to understand why they're so good.  The roast beef is actually really tender and soft.  It tastes like rare prime rib and not like your deli sliced well done leather consistancy.  Add to that a horseradish sauce that actually has some kick to it and OMG it was amazing.  DEFINITELY recommend the original.  I honestly didn't notice the cheese very much.  The horseradish and the beef were definitely the star players in this game.

I liked it so much that I went back in the morning.  At under 10 dollars for a sandwich you can't really beat it.  I'd much rather go here than a ridiculously overpriced plate of Ramsey's finest.  I know royalty when I see it, and his name is the Earl of Sandwich.",2,0,0

The fifth scotch went down like water. I stumbled through Aria's magnificent mall, eyeing expensive Kiton  and Tom Ford suits, wishing I had been born an heir to some vast fortune. ""I deserve something nice."" I had told myself.  Only a single twenty remained in my wallet after an unfortunate losing streak at the roulette table. Food. I can get food. A bridge later, I was inside Planet Hollywood, ready for the ""best sandwich in Las Vegas"", as it had been touted by fellow yelpers and friends. 

Earl of Sandwich seems like a typical sandwich place, and in many ways it is. They have a small sandwich collection, non-existent side dishes, and ordinary prices. It's not without its charm, and I have to say that I love their logo, a wigged Englisman with a look of condescension emanating from his profile. I decided to go with the Turkey and Bacon sandwich, while my girlfriend ordered the Original.

My choice was underwhelming. The bread was the best part, nice and crisp, with a bit of a cheese baked into it. However, the quality was not much better (if that) than something from Panera (their asiago bread is very similar to the bread used at Earl of Sandwich). If I had to pick the overarching theme of Earl of Sandwich, it would be saltiness. I know that bacon and turkey are processed and that nitrates and sodium are a given, but the salty taste was just so in your face that I couldn't even finish my sandwich, even with the dreaded ""drunk munchies"" I get after having a few ounces of  Johnny Walker Red Label in me. They are about 7 inches long, which is 7 inches too much to eat when a sandwich is that salty. My girlfriend's sandwich was better, but not by much. The horseradish in her original sandwich gave the roast beef a bit of a kick, but that saltiness still prevailed in the end. It was edible, however, and I ended up helping her finish hers. 

I can't recommend the turkey and bacon, but the original is okay. It's decent, something a little better than Panera (if that), but not worth going out of your way for. Described as a sandwich pilgrimage, I had expected more from the little shop. Perhaps the alcohol dimmed by tastebuds, but I find it hard to believe that less than half the people who eat her don't have at least half a stomach full of alcohol anyway.

The sandwiches were individually-wrapped and served pleasantly hot.  The bread was also quite good, mostly because it was freshly toasted.

The Original had a healthy stack of roast beef topped with horseradish sauce and cheddar cheese, and it was the favorite of the two.  The beef had a nice chew to it, which I attribute to moisture and freshness, things that low-quality roast beef lack.  The toppings, not surprisingly, complemented the beef nicely.

The Jerk Chicken was topped with a special sauce and banana peppers.  The chicken was a little disappointing, as it had the texture of the chicken in those microwavable, frozen meals.  I wouldn't be surprised if indeed the chicken WAS cooked, frozen, and simply reheated at the restaurant.  Nonetheless, the overall flavor was decent.

We also had the tomato soup, which was a tasty bisque with crispy croutons.  While nothing surprising or elegant, the soup was delightfully reminiscent of chef boyardee.

Overall, I felt that the food here tasted (and was) mass-produced, and thus it lacked nuance as well as freshness.  And, not surprisingly, the lines were long.  Nonetheless, it was satisfying sober, so I can only imagine how dreamy it would be drunk (yup, that alliteration was intended).

This happens again when my boyfriend and his group of friends was up when three other guys comes up to them, tries to use a ""Have you seen my phone"" ruse to cut in line. The cashier once again can see that the three guys were not there beforehand, yet decides to stay silent. Thank goodness the group decides to walk around them to order.

What pissed me off was we tried telling management about it, it's not fair to all the other people waiting in line.

Hot sandwiches available at all hours of the day and easy access from the main Strip, you'll see me here at least 3-4 times during a weekend. 

Tuna melt hands down, all time fave. Compared to DTD, the tuna melt here seems a whole lot cheesier. Could be the alcohol remembering that, but it's always more tastier here. They do have tabasco packs to take to-go instead of trying to steal one of their bottles....not that I've ever done that. 

Not so close seconds, but still pretty good chicken chipotle avocado and caprese. Compared to all other Vegas things, these are pretty reasonably priced. 

Line can get kinda long, but it goes by fairly smoothly. And it's not that bad when you've got a good crowd with you to keep you company. Unless you ended up the most sober and had to do the food run for everyone. 

Earl's is a must-try. It's cheap enough where you'll definitely lose more out on the tables.

I had the Mediterranean Veggie (with feta cheese, roasted bell pepper, and sliced cucumber) . The bread was nicely toasted, but it was still soft and buttery in the inside.

Well balanced as in having a refreshing taste from the cucumber, a smoky flavor from the roasted peppers, and a salty and tart component from the feta cheese. Very well balance on my palate. I was very pleased, especially that it was under $7.00 in LAS VEGAS and on The Strip, inside Planet Hollywood.

My friends and I had an ingenious idea. 2 of us ordered 2 different sammiches and split with each other so we can get to taste 2! Genius, pure genius Lloyd.

I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ and my friend ordered the Holiday Turkey Sandwich. The hawaiian had the sweetness from the pineapple with the smokey taste of barbecue, perfectly cooked. It had a pleasant balance. The holiday turkey was just like Thanksgiving in my mouth! Turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing! DANG i'm getting hungry just writing this review!

These sandwiches are pretty darn cheap and REALLY good! It took awhile for the food to be done but it was well worth the wait. The sandwich was warm enough for the cheese to be ooey gooey and the bread was perfectly toasted that added that extra texture of crunch!

For the price, you would think they would use cheap ingredients that you would find at fast food chains, but they didnt! The bacon was thick, they gave plenty of meat, the cheese was not your average american and the bread just held it all together.

As for the mac n cheese...I know I shouldn't have expected much since they are a sandwich place, but I take mac n cheese VERY serious, and theirs was just alright. I would pass on it next time I go there.

Do NOT order their veggie omelette! It came looking like a soiled rag that was microwaved in a crescent-moon mold, and tasted like soggy cardboard. To say it was overcooked beyond recognition is an understatement. My roasted potatoes were bland and disappointing as well, only slightly more palatable than the ""eggs"". The only saving grace for this dish was the toasted slice of a bagel and Smucker's grape preserves (the kind that never expires). Save your $7 for a sandwich for their lunch menu!

I also tried a bite of my friend's breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon. We both thought it was shrug-worthy, equivalent to a glorified egg mc muffin with a couple pieces of pig meat.

The two stars are for satisfying my morning fiber fix. Oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts is available for $2.50!

The main thing that bothered me was the smell.  I'm not a smoker, so it was very hard to sit in a smoke permeated place to enjoy my sandwich.  There seems to be a lot of smokers in this area on that day and no one seemed to be bothered by that.

First impression: Ugh. There was a long line, a couple of the employees looked pretty frazzled and many of the table were littered with trash. 

I ended up ordering 'The Best BLT'. A little cocky, are we Earl? I love BLTs and I love BLTAs even more, so I had them add avocado for a $1 upcharge. Then I waited another 10 minutes after I ordered to pay another employee $10 and change for the sandwich and drink. After paying I was given one of the buzzers many places use to let people know their tables are ready.  Thankfully the wait for my actual food was pretty short, I had just grabbed some napkins and filled my drink. 

My sandwich was good but mindblowing? No. Not even close. The bacon was well cooked, nothing ruins a BLT quicker then soggy bacon.. but I have had more flavorful bacon elsewhere. The bread was tasty but greasy, causing me to require a ton of napkins. The avocado really made it as good as it was, but I get the credit for that, not Earl. 

Many people call The Earl of Sandwich inexpensive, I guess for the Strip it isn't insane, but I am pretty sure that for just a few dollars more I could have found a place on the Strip where I could get a BLTA with waiter service.

If you are stumbling around Planet Hollywood all wasty-pants, these sandwiches would probably blow you away. If you are sober, or a local (or both) chances are you won't be THAT impressed by these. Worth a visit if you are in the area but not worth a special trip to the Strip in my opinion.",4,4,2

EARLS? Why you got to be so freaking delicious. It's like literally little pieces of love bites every time I bite into it. 

I've had earls many times before and it never once disappoint me. I definitely agree with their slogan ""Best Hot Sandwich in the world"". They definitely represent it extremely well. I've pretty much tried all of their sandwiches and every single one of them have their unique taste. But I have to say my favorite is their number one. It comes with turkey and tomato, I love how they have a choice of white or wheat bread. I'm all about that wheat bread due to personal reasons so that was fantastic. 

The other thing I love the most is their famous tomato soup. I've never had a tomato soup like theirs before. It wasn't too salty or too much tomato taste, it had the best texture and seasoning. I would like everyone to try dipping their sandwich into the soup too because the way their bread soaks into the soup gives it more definition to your tastebud.

Of course, it must be explosive calorie-wise, but when its that good, who the hell cares. Give me two. 

I've also tried the Montagu (I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong, apologize in advance) as well as the original, and still, I stand by the fact that their best is the Tuna Melt. Their worst sandwich that I've tried thus far is the Hawaiian Chicken one (or something like that) which was kinda bland and the chicken had no flavor.

There was hardly any wait at around 9 AM.  I ordered the Bacon, Egg 'N' Cheddar sandwich for breakfast and took a Chipotle Chicken Avocado for lunch during my hike.  The sandwiches were made pretty quickly.  Otherwise, this is always an option given that it's open 24 hours.

Bacon, Egg 'N' Cheddar - Pretty decent sandwich.  The bacon comes crumbled and slapped in a small mound in the middle of the sandwich.  On the outer edges of the sandwich, the bacon will fall out though, but enough remains so that you get bacon in every bite.  Overall, the sandwich wasn't anything to write home about but it's better than a fast food sandwich, but you pay for it.

Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Good chipotle sauce on the sandwich.  Normally this is eaten hot, but mine was taken as a packed lunch during my hike.  The lettuce wilted by then but the sandwich was still pretty good overall.  The chicken was still tender and juicy.  The combo of the sauce and the avocado play well together.  It's a pretty good sandwich.  Definitely more tasty than Subway which is just outside the Miracle Mile Shops area, but more pricey.

Earl of Sandwich is a pretty good sandwich place.  It's a step up from Subway and tastes like they use better quality ingredients.  It's a good option given that it's open 24\/7, but it's nothing I'd go really out of my way for.

And of course, because I'm a masochist and a lemming, I ordered the original 1872 roast beef sandwich at Earl of Sandwich, expecting to lump it into the same category as every other roast beef sandwich.

But it was good. REALLY good. It made me feel silly for being so obstinate about roast beef sandwiches. Had I really been missing out this entire time? The bread was freshly baked and the perfect receptacle for the simple sandwich: tender, thin slices of juicy roast beef, melted cheese, and sharp horseradish. 

On the side, I had a cup of the best tomato soup I've had in recent memory. Creamy, slightly acidic, and with a sprinkling of really good croutons, presumably made from the same tasty bread as the sandwiches.

I ordered the original sandwich, which is basically a suped-up roast beef sandwich comparable to Arby's. The bread was fine, but the quality of meat disappointed me quite a bit. While thick slices covered hastily in horseradish, the tendons absolutely ruined the sandwich. I couldn't chew through my sandwich and found myself spitting it out. The bites I could chew required mustard to make it through.

It may be a result of a very busy establishment and a lack of quality control, but I don't think my experience in Vegas was highlighted by the original sandwich. I won't be coming back here again, and I hope there will be more taste in the roast beef for those who have it in the future.",3,3,3

They have salads, wraps, soups, side items (pasta salad, potato salad, chips, etc), and hot and cold sandwiches.

I arrive and immediately see what appears to be a really, really long line.  The group in front of me, a party of about six, change their mind and leave.  That works for me!  I'm now closer a little closer to my food.  The line moves very fast, so don't be discouraged.

I just had a simple Ham & Swiss ($10 with chips & a fountain soda) but wow, what a large number of interesting sandwiches they have that I absolutely am going to have to come back and try out.

Located inside Planet Hollywood, Earl of Sandwich will definitely surprise you.  There's fairly big selection of sandwiches so it's not hard to find something for everybody.  We went for the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich and the Caprese.  The Hawaiian BBQ is my favorite out of the two.  Ham, pineapple, cheese, and BBQ sauce just go so well together.  Think of a Hawaiian pizza, transplanted between two awesome artisan bread.  OMG the bread is just awesome.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It is just toasted perfectly.  

As for the Caprese, it's your classic mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I wish there was more basil cause I think we only saw two leaves of basil.  Two!  Sorta ridiculous for a whole sandwich but the thick sliced mozza was a nice touch.

There's also some pastries and cookies available.  I went for the chocolate chip cookie.  At $1.99, it's pretty big, it's soft, and it satisfied my sweet tooth.  There's also chips by Earl of Sandwich available to go along with your sandwich.

Salads, wraps, and sides are also available but really, the main stars are the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are a bargain too, considering it is on the strip, at $5.99.  It is loud though since it's right next to the casino floor but good food at a good value is hard to beat!

Of course, it's not just for late night, as sandwiches are good anytime.  They even have breakfast items but I can never wake up early enough for breakfast :P",3,1,4

The web site claims that the Sandwich family (the same family line of the Earl who invented the sandwich), a restaurateur, and a dude by the name of Earl, created this franchise. It's easy to brag when you can honestly say that you invented stuffing things between bread. The chain also has the blessing of the 11th Earl of Sandwich and have a charter on the home page of their website. That's such great marketing. 

I know what you're thinking: ""franchise"" is a dirty word, especially on Yelp!. But no, this is a good sort of franchise, along the lines of Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out or some other hyphenated chain.

You'll notice that they have images of 18th century individuals and a mug of the Earl himself on the soda cups of the restaurant. There's a Samuel Adams-esque quality about the place. 

The sandwiches here are not too large, but the flavors stand out and ingredients are fresh. The bread is amazing, firm, but soft when you bite into it. The spreads were very unique, a cross between a honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I ordered the Earl's Club sandwich and I was very pleased to find that the turkey was moist, instead of dry and salty.

I would say that this franchise is a cross among Corner Bakery, Panera and Lawry's Carvery. They give you a buzzer (at least at this location) and you come back to pick up your sandwich when it's done. Even though the sandwiches take a little longer to make, it's well worth it and you can definitely taste the quality. 

This particular location is in the Miracle Mile shops in the Planet Hollywood hotel on the Strip. It's like the first thing you'll notice when you enter the mall from the south entrance. The seats spill onto the mall corridor and always seem to be crowded, the latter definitely being a good sign of good shit.

So this great place, along with Dunkin' Donuts, are institutions that I have to hit up whenever I'm in Sin City. I don't care what it takes, write a damn petition to the Earl himself and have him set up shop on this far-flung former colony I call western America.",3,2,2

lets start with WHY: the service was AWFUL. For a fast food place they do NOT efficiently take advantage of the large staff they have on hand. There are 4 people at the register but only ONE person who is actually ON the register. The other 3 workers are just standing behind the cashier chatting. If there is a LONG line of customers waiting to order, the best thing to do is to open up your second cashier and double the orders. There are plenty of people working on making the sandwiches, its much better than having staff members bored and waiting around while there is a long line of customers. it just looks ridiculous. 

The second time i came here the line was incredibly long and there was only ONE cashier (yet again) so i decided to call in my order instead. I skipped the long line to order n just paid at the register. The person calling out the orders for pick up had the WORST attitude. They kept making comments at me even though i was just patiently waiting. They were just being RUDE. Seriously miss you're working at a sandwich shop in las vegas, for probably minimum wage, please stop power tripping over when i can get my sandwich. 

So SERVICE for this place is TERRIBLE. Workers are rude and the wait is long for NO real reason. Upper management should really consider retraining and restructuring their system. Because terrible service is never acceptable if your running a good sandwich shop. The least you can do is make sure your employees have good customer service.

ONTO the delicious sandwiches. I would highly recommend the Montagu sandwich. It was seriously the best thing on the menu i had. The sandwich is baked so the cheese is nice and melted. All the ingredients are fresh. I also had their Jerked Chicken sandwich, and it was very good. The grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful and the peppers had a good spicy kick! I also tried their Club sandwich and that was very delectable as well. Bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt. Just something about a nice hot sandwich really hits the spot. Their bread is freshly baked so you really get a good sandwich. THe price is very affordable. One sandwich averages about $5! not bad!!

honestly The Earl of Sandwich's customer service REALLY killed it for me. I loved the sandwiches but it would be a major hindering factor for me to come back. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas, why would i put myself thru so much crap from the staff members of the sandwich shop. Please keep in mind I came here twice and had a horrible experience with their customer service both times. 

recap:
1) highly recommend calling in your order because there's usually a long wait
2) Montagu sandwich is amazing",1,1,1

Well I always remember imagining what this sandwich would taste like with ""the moistmaker"" and now I know what it tastes like!! This is it!  The stuffing is ""the moistmaker""!!! The cranberry sauce gives it the perfect sweetness for the sandwich. And turkey...and that's it! SO SIMPLE SO DELICIOUS!

This sandwich is that good that I ate it 3xs during my Vegas trip...got everyone I was with obsessed with it too, then brought 6 sandwiches back home for myself, family and friends to also experience THE BEST SANDWICH EVER!  And that wasn't enough because I think about and crave it soo much and was soo sad when I ate the last one! Now that I'm writing about it, I'm tempted to hop back on a plane to eat it ;)

It's crazy because it's a simple fast food sandwich shop and it's THIS GOOD!  It's also open 24 hours which is AWESOME!  It's the bread...it's crack bread :) Do yourself a favor and order this sandwich to experience it in your life! WELL DONE EARL, WELL DONE!!

I also had the Thai Chicken Salad - it comes with some thai sauce on the chicken already so you don't even really need the thai dressing that also comes with it.
Lettuce is fresh and doesn't taste stale like other packaged salads. the chicken was cold though to my surprise because it was supposed to be ""grilled"" chicken. 

They also offer soups like clam chowder 

Their set up is really efficient, you order at one end, move along the line past the beer and chips and then you pay at the end. The sandwiches are made assembly line style so there isn't much room for error.

After you order they give you a little buzzer thing that rings when your sandwich is up. This definitely alleviates any confusion when it's busy and the line up is really long.

Yelpers recommended the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and I was not disappointed.

Earl of Sandwich definitely knows how to handle the crowd. There was about 15 people in line and by the time I got to the front to order my sandwich, it took about 3 minutes to get to the cashier, and when I was finished paying, my sandwich was ready!!!

Amazing!!!

HUNGER!!!!!!

After a night of drinking debauchery I find myself hungry as hell. Low and behold there is this shop that is still open after hours and ready and willing to feed my alcohol induced hunger. Fortunately there wasn't much of a line however there is an extensive list. Then again anything beyond 5 items to a drunk is to be considered an extensive list. And unfortunately it doesn't help if they are unable to make the single tuna melt that I had ordered. Not wanting to wait any longer I ordered the first sandwich on the list.... which I have no recollection of what it is called. I can't tell you whether it was good. I can however tell you though that by the time I woke up that it was all gone... as was my shirt... as was my hunger... as was my buzz...
and dignity.

This visit to Earl of Sandwich was two years in the making; this place was bookmarked 5\/19\/2013.  The first time I came to Vegas in July 2013, I did not get the chance to eat here (time flies when you're having fun, I think Janet Jackson said that once).  Nonetheless, I finally made the initial visit to Earl of Sandwich.  I remember it like it was yesterday: I was hungry, it was hot out, and I just brought a pair of tennis shoes (not important, but needed to be said).

I made my selection very simple and straight to the point, I wanted The Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and sauce).  I ordered the sandwich, and then I waited.  Now, the wait was not long at all, but you know how it is when you're stomach is frantically telling you to feed it; a couple of minutes then start feeling like an eternity.  Then, BAM, I had my sandwich.  A quick note before I continue, I did not have to suffer a long wait in line, probably because I came here during the morning hours (your experience might vary).

To save the excruciating details of each bite into this sandwich, it was great considering the value. Afterwards, I pondered the next sandwiches I wanted to try in the future.  Those sandwiches include: The Original 1762, Tuna Melt,  Ham & Swiss, and the Italian.  I'll definitely be back here when I touch down in Vegas.",2,0,2

This is my humble opinion.  Not sure what the other five star YELP reviews are all about...  To each their own.",1,0,0

Definitely not worth its claim.  Yes, it has toasted artisan bread, but it has some unique sandwiches, but nothing worth raving about.

Maybe I was just expecting too much, or maybe most people who have reviewed this have never had a sandwich with artisan bread, but it was a pretty mediocre sandwich.

I tried both the Full montagu and the hawaiian one.

Both were similarly unimpressive.

Could've used an extra slice of meat to balance out the thickness of the bread.  Don't get me wrong -- the bread was good... though it would've been nice to have more variety.  But then it's not really my way.  The sandwiches are pretty much done as an assembly line so there's not customization.

My new goal in life is to try every sandwich here and I definitely see more vegas trips in my future.  So far I can cross off the Caprese, Original 1762 and the Holiday Turkey.  The Caprese consists of mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and drizzled with basalmic vinaigrette!  It was exactly like a Caprese salad in sandwich form.  The Original 1762 has slices of roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce.  The horseradish sauce is perfect and really makes the sandwich.  Now last but certainly not least is the Holiday Turkey!  After one bite, I just wanted to make out with that sandwich.  It was a unique thanksgiving sandwich for me because I had never come across one with stuffing before.  And boy did it make a difference.  The stuffing was soaked in gravy and kept the sandwich very moist!  And the turkey, cranberry sauce and seasoned mayo was good as well.

 I've been dying to check this place out and finally had an opportunity to do so tonight. I've got to say I wasn't let down at all. I love the way they cook their bread. I ordered the Roast Beef\/ Turkey sandwhich, just to play it safe. The sandwhich was very flavorful and quite tasty!

The subs were priced reasonabley(especially for the strip) at 5.99-6.49 each. The room is very nice and clean and the employees were friendly and the food was served quite fast. We went to eat towards the back since it was quite noisy around the bar\/perimeter seats. Some people might like those seats so they can people watch and be ""close to the action"".

My only complaint was the size of the sandwhiches. They were kinda small and I was still hungry when I was finished! There should be an option for a larger size! i want more! lol 

I will say it is probably the second tastiest sub I've gotten in Vegas. Firehouse just seems to be a smidgen better IMO. Maybe after I try a few more menu items, I'll reconsider that stance, but thats where I stand for now.

I'll definately be back for more though...

In all seriousness, Earl of Sandwich, located inside Planet Hollywood near PBR Rock Bar & Grill, catered to me and my cousins' both drunk and sober needs -- and for the inexpensive price of $6.49 (as of Sept. 7, 2014), might I add.

My ""gold bars"" from my last few visits include Avocado BLT and the Holiday Turkey.

The Avocado BLT is packed with a ton of itty bitty bits of bacon and a generous serving of avocado. With the toasted, crunchy bread and my addition of some Grey Poupon... ugh. Just writing about it makes my stomach grumble.

The Holiday Turkey sandwich has the fixits of a leftover sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. The sandwich includes slices of turkey, mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. REALLY delicious! This sandwich is the epitome of filling your drunchies.

I also managed to grab a side of their potato salad. It wasn't that great; it tasted what you'd expect in a potato salad. However, the portion is small for the price you're paying, so don't bother.

The staff here are a hit or miss. Most of them are friendly, but during one of our visits, the lady taking our sandwich order literally didn't say a word. I told her my sandwich, and before I could ask for a side, she prints out my order receipt and took the next customer. Uh, okay.

All in all, Earl of Sandwich delivers a bang for your buck. Huge props for keeping this place open 24 hours. If you need a bite and you're near Planet Hollywood, definitely give this place a try.",0,0,0

The Caprese
The Montagu
The Tuna Melt
The Caribbean Jerk Chicken

My Favorite by far was the Tuna Melt!!! I added lettuce and tomato to mine! AMAZING!!!! seriously the perfect texture! I felt the Montagu had great potential but the sauce (kinda sweet) really ruined it for me, next time I would request sauce on the side! The Caprese was also REALLY good! Personally I would have liked the Mozzarella slightly toasted but STILL AMAZING! Lastly was the Caribbean, I enjoyed it, tasted good...but compared to the others, I probably wouldn't get it again!

Prices are reasonable for a 24hr spot that's central to the strip. But that's all I found enjoyable.

We tried:

BLT - was good but nothing above average.

Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich - I was so excited to try this but was hugely disappointed.  There wasn't much of a chipotle taste & there wasn't enough chicken (just enough right in the middle where sliced in half but nothing elsewhere in the sandwich). Basically melted cheese, hard avocado slices (not fully ripe) & pieces of chicken here & there. Not impressed at all.

Spicy tuna wrap - ummm where was the spice? Not even a hint of spice. The tuna mixture was watery & tuna was very pasty\/dry. There were banana peppers & olives but that just made the wrap really tangy & vinegar tasting. 

If you're really hungry in vegas & everything's closed then this may do the trick. Otherwise don't waste your time. Still confused by the hype & line up for this place...",0,0,0

I've been here countless times, and tried just about the entire menu including the to-go desserts and drinks. On this last Vegas trip, I was willing to tip the valet several bucks to leave the car out by the curb, just so I could run inside the casino and buy $30 worth of sandwiches. 

Everyone knows their bread is one of the keys to their success. Lightly toasted on the outside, yet incredibly soft and fluffy on the inside. The quality of the ingredients on the inside is top notch. Then there's the packaging -- it looks like hot, gold brick, and it feels solid in your hands. As the cliche goes, it's worth it's wait in gold.

A few other tidbits -- I'm a fan of the bacon that they use in their sandwiches. If you love bacon, just find a sandwich with bacon. It's crispy and has just enough saltiness to balance everything out. Don't forget about the meatball sandwich, aka the ""Cannonball."" The meatball is juicy, and the bread soaks up all the flavors.

If you're pressed for time in the morning, don't forget about their breakfast sandwiches. They put any other breakfast sandwich to shame. Parched after walking a block on the Strip in 110 degree weather, but don't want to spend a ton on those overpriced, alcoholic slushy drinks in phallic containers? Try the frozen lemonade here. It's refreshing, it's $3, and will send you into a spinning brain freeze in no time.",10,5,6

The bread was toasty to perfection, the ratio between meat and veggies was perfect and their sauce and cheese complimented the sandwich very well. I tried using the mustard they provided, but I realized after a few horrible bites that their mustard really overpowers the taste of the sandwich. I opted to eat my 2nd half of the Earl's Club plain and it was muuchhh yummier left alone.


The second day I was starving again so I ran over to Earl's to grab a sandwich again. This time we ordered the Full Montagu and it was definitely a great sandwich. Unlike the Earl's Club which was a bit salty, the Full Montagu was much more balanced in terms of flavoring and it was seriously a great delight. I'd definitely recommend getting the Full Montagu and dripping on some of the Tabasco sauce they have at the tables. I'm literally drooling as I write this review thinking about these sandwiches.

The sandwiches here are AMAZING whether you're drunk or sober. I don't know how they make it taste so good or it might just be my imagination since I only get a Earl of Sandwich a couple times a year. Either way I highly recommend making a stop here if you're in Las Vegas.

My absolute favorite is the Chicken Avocado sandwich, it's perfectly warm, chewy, and saucy.  The Full Montague is not bad as well if you're not feeling in a chicken mood.

One critique: I wouldn't recommend getting the broccoli cheddar soup, in my opinion it was a bit too salty for my taste.

In fact, we probably would have gotten our sandwiches if it weren't for the fact that the pager they gave us, didn't work! :(

What we ordered:

The Montague- which was one of the sandwiches that most people on Yelp loved.  I liked the combination of vegetables and meat in it.  I think I enjoyed the roast beef more than the turkey though, because the turkey's texture was a little too smooth for it to seem natural.  Anyway, overall the sandwich was okay.  I can't say that I will be craving it any time soon.

The Original- I really didn't like this sandwich.  The roast beef seemed more dry in this one, maybe because it didn't have the delicious sauce that they put on the Montague.  Anyway, I found myself wanting only to eat the bread.

Which now brings me to the bread.  I think what makes these sandwiches tasty is the actual bread, everything else is just okay.  But for around 6 bucks, there's really nothing to complain about.

Rather that eat a ""food court"" lunch I decided to try the Earl of Sandwich, which is at the front of the Miracle Mile entrance.
I ordered a tuna melt, which I wanted cold.  The sandwich came out hot - the manger explained that the bread had to be baked and he offered to remake the sandwich, bake the bread, then add the ingredients.
Rather than wait, I went ahead with the tuna melt and I was pleasantly surprised.  The bread was excellent, and the tuna and cheese inside was very good.  This is also one of the less expensive meals I have had in Vegas - all in all a good deal and highly recommended.",0,0,0

Cons: I would probably stay away from the Thai wrap as it is a bit too sour (vinegar?) for me so it wasn't that tasty. I should have stuck with their Earl of SANDWICHES next time.

- the food was actually prepared so fast I was shocked! it was super busy when I went and still the wait time was so minimal, I am amazed

Earl's is open all day and is busy at standard lunch and dinner hours. But on weekend nights (mornings) after clubbing, you could be waiting in a VERY long line. But even this can be a social event.   
The pricing is good for a sub shop and the food is tasty. You will have to order and pay first, and then most likely wait about 10 minutes before you get your food. Sometimes it can be longer.

The 1762 with its simple combination of roast beef, horseradish and cheddar is hard to beat, but the Full Montagu is a close second.  I suggest ordering both for a meal, and getting a Cannonballs to go, because eating a meatball sub cold after a night of debauchery is an experience that can't really be beat.

That aside, there are four laws of Sandwich

1  Soft fillings are best served on soft breads.
2. When wet ingredients, such as tomatoes are used, a thin coating of mayonnaise, butter, cream cheese or oil should be applied to the bread as a moisture barrier.
3. Avoid placing layers of slippery, slidy substances next to one another
4. Never, ever use a bread you wouldn't eat on its own.

The sandwich I had was the earls club. Which consisted of :Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce. The sandwich was generally nice it followed all of the rules I set out aside here. It mostly stayed together very well, had good structure and mostly good taste.

The major downside I would say is that they seem to really skimp on the amount of actually filling they give, the bread seemed to be mostly bread and filler to me.

Italian for my wife - excellent sandwich. The original sandwich for me - good plain, but really good with a little dash of salt and some Grey Poupon - which they have available there.  In New York, this place would only rate a three or four star, but being that this is in Vegas, and it's relatively inexpensive, I will go ahead and give them all five stars.

I would like to point out that this review was during my third trip to Vegas this year.  I don't particularly like Vegas, and all three of my trips were related to me needing to go to vegas for the sake of other people.  In general the food in Vegas at this price point is terrible, so I was really happy to find a casual, inexpensive, relatively not so artery clogging option.  

Yes, you can pay much more and go to a nicer restaurant, but that option is $30+ per person ($45+ if you want a drink or two).  At the $30+\/$45+ (no booze\/booze) price point, I've been to a couple of nice restaurants in Vegas and from the numerous favorable yelp reviews, I don't think decent to very good food at the higher price point is much of a challenge.  I don't know about great food like you can fine in San Fran or NY, but pretty good food nonetheless.

Also, I suggest that you Avoid the buffets, even the pricier & nicer one - i don't care which buffet you go to, the food will be meh at best.  I speak from experience, my fellow yelp friends.

Last thing I want to point out about the Earl - there is a convenience store right around the corner where you can buy booze (hard liquor and beer singles) at a relatively good price.  If you want a drink, I would suggest that you pick it up at the convenience store before you get in line at the Earl.",0,0,0

I also love the location, if I remember in my usually non sober \/ sober when gambling state it's in PH so that makes it great for me and a nice location on the strip.

So why did I knock off one star? Most of the tables were dirty with trash on them.

The turkey is in the form of cold cuts (not roasted like Capriotti's) and mirrored the quality of a Quiznos or- worse yet- Subway.  The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).

I noticed something as soon as I got the sandwiches, they were much smaller than usual. I have been to Earl's more times than I can count. I've been to both this location and the one in Downtown Disney. So I knew for sure that something was off. I just thought to myself ""That's alright I guess, I don't need to be eating so much"". Then I noticed that the sandwiches were barely toasted, in fact, the holiday turkey was almost white in color. What the hell? I took a bite of the tuna melt first. It was decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. There was definitely less cheese and it seemed drier than I remembered. The contents of the holiday turkey was still pretty good, but the bread just wasn't toasted enough.

Everything in Vegas is over hyped and overpriced so take that into consideration when you are reading reviews from people on restaurants in Vegas...

Now about this place: I wouldn't go out of my way for a sandwich or for there ""out of this world"" soup, yes I know many yelpers had here Revelations, and mouthgasms, and who knows what I wasn't impressed...

The 3 star is because of the expectations that I had.

The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

So I made the short walk from Paris to try this out. I liked the fact that the line wasn't long at all, but there were a fair amount of customers. For a little over 6 bucks, I started off with the Montagu. I also like the efficiency on how orders are made, with the two separate order\/pickup sections, and the ability to see your sandwich being made. 

Little did I know that this sandwich would pack a lot of flavor. There was a fair portion of ingredients in between the bread, and the bread itself was perfectly baked. I savored every bite, but apparently I enjoyed this place so much I ended up buying 7 sandwiches over the course of the weekend, 2 of them which I brought home that following Sunday. Over the weekend, I also tried the Italian\/Scudetto and the club. 

I really think any sandwich here will hit the spot. You also get your money's worth, and for Vegas, its kinda cheap. Who needs the buffets?

I highly recommend picking up a salad with your sammich- your immune system needs some freshly tossed greens and protein so you young souls can twerk\/untz even harder this weekend. 

I've tried the Berry, Chicken and Almond salad cus I was looking for something tangy and refreshing and it was delicious. Go for the Earl's Cobb salad if you're feeling savory - there's bacon in there, life's always better with bacon.

I also like to layer some of the leafy greens into my sandwich - makes everything that much more refreshing, especially if you're here for lunch. The fresh crisp texture of the greens adds awesome to the already awesome sammich.

You should also consider ordering a second sammich to-go. Tastes great even when cold and it makes the best bedding for your tummy before your crazy adventure time.

My biggest complaint was the amount of filling; I was reminded of those generic store-made donuts with the pea-sized amount of jelly inside.

So, medium-deep inside Planet Hollywood, border of Miracle Mile shops near Sugar Factory, is a high-traffic corner the Earl of Sandwich occupies.  Quick, reliable, and relatively affordable by Strip standards.

I liken the Earl to an ever-so-slightly-more up-scale Subway.  Sufficient, but still leaves you a skosh peckish.  Panini-style bread is soft and good, however the filling meats are not particularly abundant in the six-inch long two-and-a-half-inch wide sandwich.

Had Original 1762 Roast Beast (thin slice beef, cheddar horse-radish sauce) and Holiday Turkey (thin slice turkey, cranberry sauce, dijon substituted for mayo).  Verdict?  Good, but they be stingy with the meats.  Soups were tasty, Chicken Tortilla creamy and rich, and Chicken Noodle contained nice plump egg noodles.  Again, small was quite small.  It's possible I'm just a famished greedy porker though.  Don't say it.

What surprised and impressed me most:  Blueberry Muffin from their bake shop.  Cupcake-like in consistency and perfectly tasty moist.. YUM.  To go with it, Peet's de-caff is on the menu.. yiss!  The coffee dispensing from the thermos was not hot though. *womp wommp*

For Vegas, this 5.99 sandwich will take you pretty far, esp if you've been testing your luck out at the craps table like I did haha. 

I ordered the ""full montagu"" and it was packed with a lot of filling. The bread was soooo good. I'm so particular wit bun\/bread to meat ratio whenever I eat sandwiches and burgers. This sandwhich is portioned out perfectly. Their amazing bread was laced with this sweet, delicious mustard. It just made my sandwich go from a 5 to a 10. I'm addicted.

So with some time to kill, me and the wifey decided to have dinner before the show. 

Sad to say, I have more negative observations than positive ones so let me get the negative ones out of the way so if you make it to end of this review, then at least you can reflect on some of the positives if you do decide to go here.

For starters they only have one size sandwich (6 inches) for 5.99. I had to order another sandwich just so I can have that satisfied full feeling. So 12 bucks for a foot long? Sheesh! They only use one kind of bread which is a ciabatta type. It's good but if they had sourdough or wheat it can give whatever choice sandwich you choose a whole nother world of flavor. For their meat whether it's chicken, ham, roast beef, or turkey, they put just enough for you to be able to taste it. Of course you can double the meat for an additional charge. Also don't forget you need a drink to wash it down. So more money out of your wallet. Just do what some people do. They ask for a water cup and fill it with soda. Won't be long before they start charging for that too probably. If you eat here at any time between 12 and 4 am, you're guaranteed to see drunk, fresh from the club, and high people gettin their hungry grub on. I don't know about you guys, but nothing good ever happens between those hours and Earl's is no exception.

So for the positives. Yes their sandwiches are flavorful, open 24 hours, (which is not always a good thing as described above), and at least you get free refiils on soda. 

So if I just happen to be at Planet Hollywood for some reason and it's not the freaks come out at night period, I will have a sandwich or two if my wallet allows it.",4,4,1

The bread is a pressed (panini) version of an Italian roll. It's a texture I haven't tasted before.

The Full Monague & Italian were recommended so we had to try them. Fortunately, we did not hit a long line so our food was ready in 10 minutes. The way they put together the meats and bread is tremendous. Crunchy, soft and tasty all at once!

It is open 24 hours and totally hits the spot after an alcohol filled night. On my first experience, I was waiting in a long line at 3AM in the morning, I saw this guy sleeping while sitting up with a group of his friends, from my assessment I assumed he was intoxicated. When I saw him eat his sandwich, he consumed with his eyes closed, pretty much sleep-eating. Don't think he ever opened his eyes, but you could tell from his expression that he was in full bliss. When I finally ate my first sandwich, I knew what he felt. 

I have tested most of their sandwiches and I have concluded that their best is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. So bomb that I even order one or two to go, just to eat back at the hotel. The bread that they use is what makes their sandwich amazing. You can see the sandwiches come out of the conveyer belt, freshly toasted to perfection. 

The line is usually long but goes by pretty quickly. They even pass out paper menus so you can try to decide what you want by the time you get to the front. They give you those little pager things to let you know when your order is ready. Finding a place to sit can be tricky. Don't be surprised if it's packed at 3AM in the morning.

I even got sandwiches to go for the long ride home back to San Diego. Though they have a location near Disneyland and in Harrahs Rincon, I still prefer to indulge on their sandwich in Vegas, the atmosphere, the environment, and being in the Vegas mentality just adds to the taste.",0,0,0

The condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.

You can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!

Now, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese.

But we don't go to Strip places very often unless we have a reason.  We finally did:  a new show with comp tix at Planet Hollywood, and two hungry Yelpers not wanting to wait to eat after the show ended.  Perfect match.   

Hubby and I both decided to order the same sandwich, pastrami, which doesn't let me write an extensive review of the food.  It was a good sandwich, very lean pastrami, but not all that plentiful.  The reported swiss cheese wasn't noticeable.  That was okay with me: I don't like swiss cheese, but didn't change it because to my way of thinking, cheese on a pastrami sandwich is sacrilegious.

Strip prices being what they are, though, I guess it was as much as we should have expected, because this was  reasonably priced based on Earl's location.  The bread?  Good, now that I've all but given up hope of ever finding a sandwich on a crisp baguette in Las Vegas.  I'll have to go back to the east coast for that bit of heaven.

We also ordered a bowl of tortilla soup.  I didn't want to, since I learned only after asking that it's a cream soup.  Rule #1:  authentic tortilla soup does not contain cream.  Rule #2:  I should not eat creamed soups.  They're bad for me.  And for my husband.  But he's not as much as a stickler for the rules as I am, so I let him get it after learning - again only after asking - that the tomato soup was also CREAM of tomato.  So much for healthier alternatives.  Would it be so hard to write that on the chalkboard these soups were listed on?  Having said that, it was a very tasty soup, as long as I didn't tell myself that it was tortilla soup (See Rule #1 above).  

In sum, Earl of Sandwich is a decent place if you're a tourist in LV on a budget.  For us, we're not likely to feel the urge to return unless we're at PH again for some reason and in a hurry.",3,2,2

Maybe it will be the $5.99 price tag for a hot sandwich

Maybe it will be the soft toasted bread you get your sandwich on.

Maybe it will be the fresh roast beef slices they put on your sandwich

Maybe it will be the loud drunkards you can watch spilling out of Rock Bottom while you are standing in line at Earls

Maybe it will be the gourmet brownie ice cream sandwiches they have. 

Maybe your a vegetarian so this is one of the only legit places you can get a healthy\/veggie meal (Veggie and Caprese sub) 

Maybe it'll be the fact that since you're in Vegas you are opting to eat only one meal a day to save money for gambling.

The bread was great. The meat was piled just high enough, not too obnoxious and not too skimpy. The condiments and veggies were just the right touch. Definitely worth the cab ride up.

Looking for some cheap(er) foods in Las Vegas after spending it all on gambling, shows, and buffets? The Earl of Sandwich can help! Located in Planet Hollywood, it is one of the cheapest and best foods that Las Vegas can offer! The sandwiches are only $5.99, which is half the price of anything else found in the City of Sin! We had the:


The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce (healthy and delicious)


Caribbean Jerk Chicken - Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce (spicy with a pinch of sourness)

The sandwiches here are one of the best I've ever had. Once you've had some here, it makes Togos, Subways, and Quiznos taste like secondary citizens. Great thing about this place: it's open 24 hours, so when you're up gambling the night away, have one on the Earl! The Earl knows sandwiches... he did create them, in the first place!

The only 24 hour spot in Vegas that I CRAVE all the time while I'm in the city of sin or back home. Located conveniently by the entrance\/exit of Planet Hollywood's Casino and the entrance\/exit of the Miracle Mile, right across from that over the top bar... I forgot what it's called with their neon red sign. Anyway moving on. 

I HIGHLY recommend everything on their menu. A few of my personal favorites are The Original, Hawaiian BBQ (tarty but no overload), Full Montagu (the sauce is delish), and the Club. The ingredients are written on the board underneath the sandwich names, and it pretty much explains it all. They keep it simple and tasty and keep you coming for more. The best part about Earl's is the bread. It's so warm and soft and has a light but hearty taste. 

My friends and I love Earl's so much we all grab two sandwiches on our way back home. And when a friend of mine went a couple of weeks ago, I made sure she brought me back a sandwich. Yes. That's how bomb it is.

What we ordered:
The Full Montagu (Roast beef and Turkey with Swiss and Cheddar) - This sandwich was just less than OK. Absolutely nothing special about it. I believe every sandwich comes with 'lettuce' and 'tomatoes'. Wait what? WHAT LETTUCE? WHAT TOMATOES? They were so dinky; there was absolutely no crunch from the lettuce NOR juiciness from the tomato. This sandwich was just so dry... I had to drench each bite with the mustard provided at each table to keep from throwing the sandwich across the slot machines.
The Cobb Salad -  Again nothing spectacular about this salad. I'm a Cobb Salad fanatic, and I can honestly say I've had far better from grocery store deli's. They really do skimp out on everything :(

I feel semi-bad for bashing on this place... but I'm utterly disappointed that it was all hype. I believe the 4.5 stars comes from its convenience and price, not the quality of food. I can see this place being OK drunk food since it's open 24\/7.

The carribean jerk sandwich had an amazing spread to it, packed a powerful kick with some tender loving. I've named the carribean jerk sandwich my favorite of all time.

The bread had a nice crisp to it, it wasn't to crisp because u can feel the softness of it too. PLus the turkey and bacon made it really good.

Ironically, the first place I stayed at in Las Vegas was at the PH and I got to enjoy this place up to 3 times during a weekend trip....

Okay the star missing is because of their ""factory-like"" mechanical processing of their sandwiches now that they have 1100+ reviews and hundreds of hungry, drunk people wanting their food everyday. Hey, they're open 24 hours, so I understand their concern to be quick... but at the same time they are affecting their quality.

In 2009\/2010, I could enjoy multiple sandwiches that were fluffy and not mashed together by the server. Maybe I'm just bitter or maybe I glorified those first few sandwiches, but I don't think Earl will ever be the same. It's still worth the $6 for each sandwich compared to some pricey, fast-casual eateries on the strip, but I'd rather just go to the Monte Carlo Food Court and grab a McDonald's sandwich or Subway instead for less.

Okay.. well here goes. My friends are going to hate me for this, but I just have to say it. Earl of Sandwich is good, but it is definitely not amazing or 5 star worthy. I'm SORRY!!

Since it opened, I've probably been here numerous times. And i must say, it's pretty much a staple in all of my Vegas visits. Why then, do I only give it 3 stars? Well.. personally I think the sandwiches are good here but it's not the best sandwich i've ever had in my life... 

For a meal at the wee hours of the night, a nice pipping hot, cheesy, melty, carb heavy, meaty sandwich is probably the only thing that will make your night of debauchery even better.

With that said, yes, if you haven't tried Earls, you must do so. You just must.. for the experience, for the claim that you've tried it, and for your own judgment. You must wait the in the atrocious line (which really isn't that bad) and judge for yourself if this place is up to the hype.

The sandwiches are good a size, they don't skimp on the meat, and the ingredients are simple and straight to the point. Also for around $6, it's one of the better deals on the strip that won't go breaking your bank.

Anyhow, if you must try it.. go for the Full Montagu. For a first timer, that is the best choice. But do be warned, their sandwiches are greasy! So be prepared...and the bread is pretty thick, so half the sandwich will probably fill you up.

I ordered the hawaiian bbq, and was completely in love with it!  I figured the bread might get soggy because of the sauce, but it wasn't at all!  The bread was tasty too, and very light.  I became quite the fan and made frequent visits here on my trip.

I tried the Caprese sandwich which is basically slices of mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.  This by far was my absolute favorite sandwich there.  The vinagerette was perfect with the melted cheese and the tomatoes were just perfect!

Their sandwiches blow every other sandwich chain out of the water.  Yes, I'm talking to you Subway and Quiznos.  They use high quality, fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.  And at $5.99 a sandwich, it's a steal!

I used to think the Full Monagu was the best, but I've come to realize that THE ORIGINAL is the way to go.  Freshly roasted beef, cheddar and creamy horseradish sauce on their signature hot, toasty artisan bread.  *drool*  Don't worry, the horse radish isn't overpowering at all.  I also like the tuna melt, but wasn't really a fan of the Caribbean jerk chicken.  I'm going to try Cannonballs! next time.

Earl of Sandwhich is just a short hop and a skip away from the casino, and the line was pretttty long. But the sandwiches were good enough and\/or we were lazy enough that we ended up getting in line anyway. 

Ravenous B (as usual) ordered the Cannonball! and the Earl's Club. Cannonball! was only okay, nothing notable, but The Earl's Club was a very classic sandwich - can't go wrong there. I got the Italian, which was BOMB. Even though the sandwiches are on the small side, I didn't end up eating all of it since we also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which was delicious and scaldingly hot (""And Andrea, I mean SCALDING hot."") Another +1 since we both hate lukewarm soup. Saved the last half of my sandwich to eat later that night, and it was STILL delicious.

Although it constantly sports a long line, the Earl is one of the cheapest, filling meals you can grab in the City of Sin (short of trekking to one of the over-franchised food court locations). Compared to food around the world, the Earl wouldn't earn a full five stars. But when you take into account that you're on the strip, probably some degree of hungover or drunk, and looking to save your money for alcohol, gambling, and female escorts, it's probably one of your best bet in the area.

I enjoyed my sandwich much more than my other dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs, but then again, I went with their ""famous hot sandwich"" - The Original 1762. It sports a huge pile of roast beef, sharp cheddar, and plenty of creamy horseradish sawwce.

The Earl is open 24 hours. I don't usually crave sandwiches at 4 in the morning in Vegas. But when I do, I make sure it's an Earl of Sandwich.",4,3,5

I was disappointed by the mac & cheese. It was WAYYYYY over cooked and bland. For it being lunch time you'd think it would be fresher tasting than that. They should look into ""Jus Mac"" restaurants and learn how mac and cheese should be done. Classing that dish up a bit more would help as well.

I ordered the OG sandwich! Yeeee
freshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce. It was a perfect combination. The horseradish went well with errythangg. 

My bf ordered the montagu sandwich which consisted of the whole shebang--freshly roasted beef, turkey, swiss cheese & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. I think this was a little too heavy and too much for my appetite.

I was eye-ing on the turkey holiday sandwich but it seemed way too heavy for me. Next time fo'sho! 

We also ordered their loaded potato soup which was very yummy! =)

On our most recent trip to Vegas- I should have remembered that.  We had tried Earl's before and we knew that no matter what we had to make an apperance this trip and have our good friends try it.   It is BY FAR the best place I have eaten at on the strip, at a price that no one can complain about (regardless of how much $$$ Vegas sucks out of your pockets).  

We absolutely LOVE Earl's Club. I usually hate mustard anything. It doesn't even taste like mustard. It is just a great blend of flavors on delicious bread. My boyfriend likes the Hawaiian too.

You may be asking.. why a 4 Star Rating? Because your experience largely depends on what sandwich you order.

I decided to be adventerous and order the Caprese.  Mozzarella Cheese, tomatoes, balsamic vingairette.  Sounds good, right?   I guess it just wasn't for me. When I opened up the foil, I thought I had picked up the wrong sandwich because the cheese was HUGE and looked like really white chicken.  I took a bite and knew that would not have appeased my ultimate craving for Earls. I stood back in line and order the Club ... and thank god I did, it was delicious!

But honestly, the rest of their sandwiches are just as good I'm sure. I first tried Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney and fell in love. When I spotted this location in Planet Hollywood I had to stop by. There was a bit of a line but they have the ordering and paying process down. You tell your order to one person and bring your receipt and pay to the next person. Super quick and the food comes out just as quick. For one sandwich, a side of potato salad and tomato soup, my total was about $15. Now this is a steal in Las Vegas!! In a sea of expensive of food places, there is a glimmer of hope with Earl of Sandwich. Where you can get a delicious and filling meal in under $20. 

The Original sandwich is where it's at. Roast beef and horseradish sauce is the best combo. The bread is nice and toasted, doesn't get soggy at all. This sandwich is just so flavorful, it's impossible to not just inhale it. The sides are just as good! The potato salad is a decent size at just a few extra dollars. Same with the tomato soup, it was about $3 for their small. They have a bunch of other options if you're not in the sandwich mood like wraps and salads.

Bread is very fresh (toasted to a perfect amount, not too much, slightly crunchy but not really with soft parts). I got the albacore tuna which tasted amazing, and although usually not a fan of cheese, their swiss cheese somehow managed to satisfy me. I definitely recommend this one. I also tried all my friends' such as the original, all American, and meatball. All of them were so unique but tasty in a very different way.

Montagu- 4\/5= tastes like an ordinary BLT to me 
Caribbean Jerk- 5\/5= Peppered chicken with a kick, love it! 
Hawaiian- 3\/5= Tastes like a Hawaiian pizza, unfortunately, I'm not a fan of sweet food so no tangy bbq for me

I took my son along.  We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.

When we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.

I was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.

After about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.

The Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.

So, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!

This place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.

(4), Service: it's a 24 hour counter service establishment. Given the reasonable price and quality, it's almost always inundated with people (3), Value: breakfast sandwiches for $3.99 and the other hot sandwiches for $5.99 - this place is a steal on the Strip (5).

We were super stoked that the Earl of Sandwich made it's way to the Strip. We first had Earl of Sandwich in Florida and instantly fell in love with the reasonable prices and solid food.

Unlike other places which toasted fully cooked bread, Earl of Sandwich's ciabatta bread comes probably 98% baked and leaves the remaining 2% for their toasting oven. That allows their bread to develop a lovely golden brown crispy crust on the outside while retaining a dense chewy texture on their inside. The robust little loaves really hold up to the fillings and sauces.

The ratio of bread to filling is perfect - not too much to overwhelm the bread but substantial enough to feel satisfied. The lettuce is green leaf cut in whole pieces which adds a nice textural contrast while the tomatoes are perfectly ripe. The meats are well-prepared and succulent, unlike the typical rubbery flavourless textures you might see at your regular fast food outlets. They usually add just the right amount of sauce to moisten the filling without making everything soggy.

Given the great prices and quality, this place can get pretty busy throughout the day unless you get here early in the morning. But it is definitely worth a stop for a nice satisfying budget meal. 4 stars.",5,2,3

The price was very affordable at $5.99 for a hot sandwich or wrap.  Their service can be improved because the cashier was definitely not helpful. But at least the food came out fast and fresh. 

Hawaiian BBQ: If you like ham and pineapple this is definitely a top choice.  The bread was perfectly toasted like a panini and the BBQ flavor was sweet and flavorful.  

The Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomato, and Earl's mustard. This one tasted like a classic sandwich.  It was hot, fresh, and of great quality.  It wasn't greasy, but delicious.  However, it doesn't have the unique flavors of the Hawaiian BBQ.

I suppose this is technically an edible sandwich and it's cheap, which is the only reason I'm rounding up here, but what the hell is with all this praise? 2,000 reviews+ and still a 4.5 star rating for something less edible than any random Quiznos or Potbelly... I just don't get it. Granted, I was doing everything I could to keep my brain from pounding out of my skull as Brian and I waited patiently in the somewhat quick moving but incredibly long line, but I still think I was functioning enough to know that this was a disappointment of pretty big proportions.

A few years ago when Nicole was staying in Vegas for a brief conference I suggested the Earl as one of the places she should definitely hit for a quick meal, based mainly on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Her response was basically ""it's a good sandwich"", with little emphasis in either direction. I thought, OK, maybe she just tried the wrong one (although it was definitely the one I would have gone for as well). I happened to see Venu N's review just prior to my trip, and it sort of confirmed what I was fearing, that this was somehow just the average public broadcasting basement show which somehow snowballed itself into primetime relevance. Or perhaps it's some combination of groupthink with the more dangerous drunkthink.

I think I only paid about $6 for my ""Cannonballs!"" sandwich, which is probably fair enough, but it was just so unimpressive. Just look at the photo, it's sad. The bread was warm and toasted on the ends but not so much in the middle, and the meatballs were sparse and cold inside. I felt less awful, physically, after eating it, but I'm not so sure that statement couldn't have applied to virtually anything at that point. There really just isn't anything special here. I was certainly still hungry afterwards, as these sandwiches are pretty small when compared to their competition.

I implore you, ignore all the ""amazing"" and ""OMG"" nonsense that you'll read here. It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it. If you, for some reason, happen to be in this dreadful mall and simply cannot make it anywhere else before dying of starvation, then go ahead and eat here. Otherwise, find a better meal elsewhere, because really, who comes to Vegas to go the cheap route?",16,9,15

Their sandwiches are so fresh and amazing. They have so many interesting choices like caribbean jerk chicken! From the times I went, each sandwich has not failed to disappoint. The Montague is always a safe but yummy choice if you're not feeling too experimental.

Pros: (all the sandwiches we shared)
-Caribbean Jerk Sandwich - my personal favorite because I like a little kick. 
-Hawaiian BBQ Sandwich - great combo.
-Earl Club Sandwich - This one was good and then continued to grow on me as I ate it. 
-Original Sandwich - Classic roast beef and cheese.
-Earl potato chips - reminded me a lot of Boulder Chips. Love them.
-Frozen Earl Lemonade - sour but not too sour, I kicked it up a notch by buying a shot of vodka across the way.

Cons: 
-Long Line (but not that bad, it moves faster than you think and it gives you time to look at a menu)

You may like variety and you may like switching things up every now and then, but my recommendation is to always go with The Original 1762 (freshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce). The bread is amazingly good, too, because it is only half-baked before they make your sandwich. When they send it through the conveyor belt oven, the entire sandwich gets heated\/baked to perfection.

My top 4 reasons for going to Earl of Sandwich:
1) The Original 1762 is absolutely delicious!
2) The prices are fantastically low!
3) It's open 24\/7
4) Service is fast

Give this place a try, you will not regret it!",1,0,0

I did wait in line around 1pm for about 10 minutes.  I also have been there at 11:30am with no line.  Either way, the line goes quick.  Sandwiches are not customizable much, as this is not Subway or Quizno's.  Just a heads-up.

I've had the Thanksgiving turkey and the Jerk chicken sandwich.  Both absolutely delicious.  I found the the Jerk chicken exceptional.  Both are served up warm after being toasted.  Also, they aren't HUGE sandwiches--about 7 inches long.  Although I practically inhaled both of my sandwiches (I was hungry), I washed them down with several refills of their very tasty Earl's Lemonade, which has earl grey tea in it--kinda like their version of the old Arnold Palmer.  

The desserts look very tempting, especially the vanilla bean cupcake.  Haven't tried one of those yet.  With drink, my bill was just north of $9.  Fair enough for an excellent sandwich.  I'll come back without hesitation.",0,0,0

I ended up trying this place partially because I wanted to see what the best cheap eats in Las Vegas were. So I went there one day and grabbed a late lunch, and when I took my first bite it was absolutely wonderful. So much better than any sandwich I've had in Canada. 

I love their full Montagu sandwich, it was tasty, delicious and of great value. (In Canada are food portions are usually smaller than the U.S, so for me the sandwich was a good size.) The bun is always crispy but not hard so that it rips the roof of your mouth. (not a fan of hard breads) and the way that everything just melds is amazingly simple yet is a melt in your mouth experience that is hard to describe.

During my stay in Vegas I ate there 3 times and each sandwich has always made my stomach smile. (I remember one was Hawaiian, but I can't remember the 3rd). The only downfall is that if you are a bit of health nut then you may want to watch out for the sodium levels. I know they are quite high. 

But what most people may not mention is that their salads are absolutely great for the price you pay. Salads are never prepackaged and suffocating in a plastic container. They are made fresh and taste wonderful. The pricing of around 6 bucks for a salad is almost unheard of in Las Vegas. 

At the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 US, definitely go to Earl. You can't get better value. 

Considering what the cost of other meals in Vegas are, this is a great place for bachelors and people who are with a family and budget conscious.",2,0,0

It was delicious and better than what I had expected. I already had seen the reviews, heard the raves about the warm sandwiches from my friend, but it was so delicious that it has to be about the best sandwich ever - and at an affordable price!

So Earl's is open 24 hours and is located in Planet Hollywood. I'm sure people flock here after the clubbing events and whatnot - that explains the 24 hours deal. We came here around 12 on a Saturday and there was a long line, but not too long a wait. You basically give your order to the cashier and she gives you a beeper and a receipt where you slide down the counter (watching them make the sandwiches and salads) before you pay at the second cashier. And a few minutes after that, your beeper rings signaling you to pick up your sandwich. 

There were so many great options that I really wanted to try them all. In the end, I got The Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce) and my friend got the Tuna and we traded half. The Club was really good - but what's so great about it is that the bread is warm and crispy, making the sandwich an overall plus. There wasn't too much bacon, but I liked the amount of turkey that was in it. The tuna was also great. The warm bread, a plus, and the tuna salad inside was awesome (better than Subway!). They cut the sandwich for you into a bigger half and a smaller half, but the overall sandwich is not that big. Perhaps about 6 inches. Each is wrapped up in a gold foil with a pretty sticker to differentiate between the various sandwiches. 

There's a few tables to sit down and eat and relax. For the price of the sandwich (around six\/seven dollars), I was pretty pleased. If only they came with some complimentary potato chips on the side :)

Set up with an order counter where you order on one end, pay On the other and your buzzer goes off when goodies are ready. 

Both of us had the holiday turkey sandwich (which was very good!). Stuffing, turkey, gravy, mayo and cranberry sauce all warmed on toasted bread. I know some complained about the small size but we thought it was perfect, as it is quite filling and dense.  We are both EATERS and did not eat our entire sandwich. My potato soup was good but nothing super special. Make sure to specify what size soup you want. I said ""cup"" (assuming cups and bowls) and they have me the largest size. Tasted fresh and good potato chunks. Hubby thought his tomato soup was okay. It had croutons on top and was pretty basic. We ordered our son a side of Mac and cheese and it was really good and a decent size. For these items and two regular drinks, our total was about $35. Pricey but typical Vegas.

For a long time I heard the buzz of famous Earl of Sandwiches and I was worried that they would not live up to the hype.  But during 2011 I had the opportunity to make two trips to Vegas and I finally go to experience the amazingness for myself.   

I have tried the following two of the sandwiches on the menu:

The Full Montagu- Roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and of course yummy mustard.  It is called the full montagu for a reason.  It really has all of the sandwich essentials.  At 3 am it was worth the extra cab ride.

The Original - Roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish.  Of the two I think this was my favorite.  It was uncomplicated and gets straight to the meaty cheesy flavor with a tiny kick of the creamy horseradish.  So it doesn't have any vegetables...you don't go to Vegas to eat healthy!  

Here are some fun facts\/helpful tips:

1.  It is open 24 hours so if you had a little too much fun in the night, don't worry you can always get your grub on at any time

2. Divide and conquer! Send someone to scout and grab a table and send someone else to place the orders that way by the time your food is ready you should have a place to enjoy and rest your sore feet

The first thing that stands out about Earl of Sandwich is the price.  When you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in DC, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  And when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.

I tried The Original 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  I also had a taste of The Full Montagu, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard.  First off, the bread is outstanding.  It's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  The meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  Although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which I did not personally try, but have heard good things about).

I was skeptical about how a sandwich place could have so many positive reviews, but now I know.

Sandwiches are in my top 3 things to eat. I love them. Period.

The first thing you'll notice are how LOW the PRICES are compared to everything in Vegas. Great food for under $7??? YES! ONLY AT EARL OF SANDWICH.

--HOT SANDWICHES--
I must admit, I was here twice in one day. Their sandwiches are made to order, use great ingredients, and are toasted in their very own Artisan baked loaf. 

I started off with the CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO for $6.50 which included grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle sauce. Simple ingredients, amazing combination, definitely recommend this one.

Later that night I had THE ORIGINAL 1726 for $6.50 which included roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish sauce. This was especially great on a cold night. This warm sandwich really hit the spot and the roast beef was delicous.

--CONCLUSION--
Whenever I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by Earl of Sandwich at least once. And yes, some of my friends make fun of me for that...but I don't care. Not only is it extremely affordable for The Strip, they make awesome hot sandwiches, AND they're open 24 HOURS! There is often a long line, so if you're truly looking for a quick meal, you may want to avoid this place. If there is a short line, you better hop in quick!

This wasn't exactly where I saw myself eating with all the choices on The Strip.  When it came down to a decision, I couldn't refuse the loudly reviewed sandwich shop which now advertises that they OPEN 24 HOURS outside.  

*Chicken tortilla soup - Bun and I almost always get a soup and share.  Through experience of sandwich shop soups, the soups usually are menu fillers.  Due to the constant reheating, flavor and freshness disappear over time.  Ranking them atop many franchise soups, the chicken tortilla soup wasn't too shabby.    
  
*Cannonballs! - Yeah, ""Cannonballs!"" is the name of the sandwich.  Also don't forget that exclamation point when ordering.  Like a good o' cannonball to the face, nothing surprising here, inside they have marina, cheese, and hunky balls of meat.  Boy does my Bun love her meatball sandwiches.  Even at Subway, when in doubt, her choice would be a meatball sandwich.  Chowing down the sandwich, I wrestled it away from her for a bite.  That singular bite almost led to a second.  That is until Bun put a sleeper hold on me and yanked the sandwich out of my hand.  

*Earl's Club - What's the difference between Earl's Club and a turkey club?  Not much besides the name.  Turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato were what I tasted before gulping it down.  Do I have any comments on the sandwich?  ""Good"".  My mouth is still full.  Don't bother me.        

All sandwiches are about six inches and deceivingly filling.  In view of the fact their label of a franchise, nearly all ingredients tasted very fresh.  Their most underrated attribute are the artisan bread used for buns.  

For about the same price, why would anyone on Earth pay for a Subway sandwich?  Budget friendly and open all the time, Earl of Sandwich is a wise choice for the haggard Strip journeyers.  In need for food and a place to rest their feet, Earl of Sandwich is a very useful alternative on The Strip.",9,9,10

Oh how I've been longing to meet you.  

After multiple Vegas trips, I still couldn't find a good reason to come to your house at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shops until last month.  Not sure if you remember me, but I came with 3 other people and it was their first time meeting you too. 


I kinda feel bad because I was the one who suggested checking you out. Thank goodness the time I came to see you, there was no line because waiting in line for a sandwich, that shit cray.  But I'm glad my friends enjoyed your company. 


For me, it was kinda like a going on a date.  Spending money and at the end of the date, I'm left wanting more.  Usually that's a good thing.  But after I left you, I saw some lobster roll place and kinda wish I spent my time and money there.  Which is usually not a good thing.

However, $5.99 a sandwich, I wouldn't be totally against coming by to see you again.  

Don't call me, I'll call you.

Smooches,

Bong E


PS - I got to try The Original and The Club.  Maybe next time I'll try the Cannonball because I had a friend drop a meatball on the floor and thought about eating it.

My fiancee said that the Montague was the best sandwich she's ever had.  I won't go on to say that much, although this sandwich was up there with other sandwich greats.  Earl of Sandwich certainly gets a spot in the pantheon of great sandwiches.  Here's why:

Selection - This place has a massive selection of sandwiches.  Anyone ordering something here is bound to find one of their favorites.  From their savory Hawaiian, which includes ham and pineapple (tastes just like a Ham\/Pineapple pizza on a sandwich to me) to their Jerk Chicken (for those who like it spicy), this place is sure to please.  They also offer a plethora of desserts.

Service - The service is friendly for the most part.  We went to this location twice during our visit to Vegas.  The first time was better than the second.  During our second visit, the cashier decided to have a ""fuck my life"" moment and didn't really acknowledge us.  Other than that, the service is good, I'll take the second experience as a rare occurrence.

Bread - This place isn't like other sandwich shops in the regard that you only get one type of bread, GOOD BREAD!!!  For what they restrict in selection in the bread department, they make up for by making the bread they have excellent.  I liken this bread to a brick, only because it is formed like one.  In fact, when you get the sandwich in it's distinctive wrapping, it looks exactly like a gold brick.   Don't worry the bread isn't hard like one, it's soft and buttery, yet has some crispiness to it.  

Some sandwich shops gain their notoriety by having the ""biggest sandwich"" around or the ""messiest sandwich around"", Earl of Sandwich does neither.  The sandwich itself is actually smaller than what you'd expect, but the taste more than makes up for this.

Do yourself a huge favor the next time you're in Vegas, hit up Earl of Sandwich!",1,1,1

This has got to be one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. Not only are they open 24 hours a day but they are sooooooo good and at such a reasonable price! $5.99 for most of the sandwiches. 

I tried the Full Montague and once i took that first bite I instantly fell in love. The bread is so good and crispy on the outside but super soft on the inside. The sauce they used was unbelievable and the 2 meats and 2 cheese and tomato and lettuce fit perfectly all together. This place was so good that my 2 guy friends that came with me had to get in line again for seconds w\/in 10 minutes. 

The only downside is that there is a bit of a line to order but the sandwiches are made right away when you sit down. Seating is also a bit hard to look for but if you just stand around and look at people who are almost finishing you shouldn't have a problem.

I was in Vegas for a quick weekend and because I wanted to avoid the lines at the buffets, I ate dinner fairly early.  By the time I was done walking around , I was hungry.  I was staying at the Cosmopolitan, so Earl of Sandwich (which is located at Planet Hollywood) is a short walk over. I have been to Earl of Sandwich before, but it has been years since I went, so I was hoping that the quality and taste did not go downhill.  (I have also tried the Earl of Sandwich in Disneyworld and although it was great, I felt it was not as amazing as the Vegas location).  

I normally get the Montagu, but this time I wanted to try the Chicken Avocado sandwich.  For 12AM on Saturday, the restaurant was fairly empty.  I ordered and got a buzzer.  There was plenty of seating around and the sandwich came out super quickly.  I bit into the hot sandwich and YUMMMM!!!! The chicken was tender, avocadoes fresh, and the bread was crispy.  The only small complaint that I have is that the chipotle dressing was a little on the light side (which probably is better for me anyways, LOL).  So, if you like more dressing on your sandwich, make sure to order extra dressing.  Aside from that, it was a delicious snack to cap off my weekender in Vegas. I was excited to learn that the sandwich still was amazing.  I will definitely be back here again anytime I am back in Vegas.",10,6,7

Earls is a must if you are in the same city of a location because they are so sparse, the only other location I have been to is in Downtown Disney in CA.

Anyways I have been here three times now, but this past time was special because I was sober enough to fully enjoy the sandwich!

This particular location is located at Planet Hollywood right when you walk in. Stop walking past in hopes you will find something else, you won't.

I looove the Full Montagu, perfect for all you meat lovers out there! This sandwich is packed to the brim with meat and the bread is always warm and just the right texture. I highly recommend eating it with the hp steak sauce, BOMB.COM!

Another favorite is their new chicken chipotle sandwich, omggzz, heaven in my mouth. It's super saucey and flavorful. Comes with avocado so it has that rich creamy taste. MM MM GOOD, I think it can be considered as my new crack *__*

My personal favorite on the menu! I love the banana peppers and the right amount of spicyness of this sandwich. I even add Tabasco Sauce to kick it up a little bit! This is a must have if you have never been to Earl before.  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!

Italian Sandwich:
Italian sandwiches are great wherever you go but this certainly is one of the best sandwiches on the menu. Make sure you eat it right away while its hot and order the delicious salt n vinegar chips to go along with it!

Tuna Sandwich:
One of the simplest sandwiches on the menu with it having only 2 ingredients on the inside, Albacore tuna and swiss cheese.  The bread is of course what makes this sandwich but every sandwich is served hot and this hot tuna sandwich was SUPERB!

The Original:
If you're into Horse Raddish and Roast Beef this is awesome! I also love the earl's spicy mustard they put to add some kick to it!

Earl's frozen Lemonade: 
EXCELLENT! Just like the frozen lemonade you buy at disneyland. Cheap too!

Caprese Sandwich:
If you've ever been to italy or just had mozarella and tomato Caprese or just enjoy something without meat, this sandwich does the trick. Too bad they dont make this smaller, because it would be a great appetizer.

Kono Coffee:
Not bad, I prefer walking to Coffee Bean inside miracle mile!",2,1,1

\/\/ HOW TO \/\/
     -Figure out what type of sandwich you want
     -Order at the first counter and hold on to your receipt and buzzer
     -Grab goodies in line: beverages, side salads, and sweets
     -Pay at the other end for your sandwich (thus hang on to your receipt!) and all the goodies you got
     -Find a seat and when your buzzer goes off, go claim your sandwich in all of its gold foil glory.

\/\/ FOOD \/\/ I'm a carb monster, and the freshly baked and toasted bread is really what makes these sandwiches so special. 

     + Full Montague: The ultimate sandwich with roast beef, turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. It is a savory, well-rounded, and tasty sandwich, albiet, slightly on the salty side. 
     + Caprese: For non-carnivores. Thick slices of soft mozzarella with a generous drizzle of balsamic and freshly cut basil. It is refreshing and delish.",1,1,1

What made me sad was Earl had an advantage in me being vulnerable to hunger and dehydration.  Maybe I expected much more from this famous spot but I honestly would have rather eaten a foot long meatball subway sandwich.

 I had the chipotle chicken burger with bacon. The bread was really good soft and a toasty exterior. Sauce was good. Though there was never a  time where I was like ""damn this is good!""

Dont matter what time of day it is, we all know Vegas never sleeps. Neither does Earl of Sandwich since it is opened 24 hours. You get to see some interesting drunks at 3am in the morning. 

All these different sandwiches to choose from made when you order it so its all nice and hot.

So I must say, I was extremely delighted & surprised to dine here at Earl of Sandwich. Now me and some friends came here after a long night of drinking and a 3-hr heater on a craps table. With the afterparty drinks being on the house, we were still pretty tossed, and this sandwich hit the spot. Sure, it was 9am and we were mad drunk while other tourist families were giving us the staredown, but I do not apologize! After some sleep, I was thinking about killing the world to cure my hangover, and then I started to think about real things like, ""was that sandwich really that bomb? or were u really that wasted?"" To get to the bottom of it all, I came back...and it really is just that good.

The place is fast and what value! $5.95 flat rate the whole way through! I ordered ""the Earl's Club"" (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) and ""the Original 1762"" (Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish Sauce)--both scrumptious! The toasted Panini and hot ingredients make this. My biggest complaint is that they could've been bigger--I feel like I could easily eat two of them in one sitting but I'm a fatass personally. I feel like most chicks would be satisfied with one of Earl's ""Cannonballs!"" [sorry, cheesy bad taste joke ;] But seriously, my other friends recommend that sandwich and ""the Italian"". Definitely coming back the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood. I would suggest this to anyone in the area looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price.",3,9,3

Heading to Vegas for Labor Day weekend!  Woo hoo!  Party party?  Well, yes that's a given.  But is it sad that one of the stops I am looking forward to making is THE Earl of Sandwich?  24 hours a day 7 days a week of yummy sandwich goodness!

Been here at least four times and it has been consistently good EVERY time.  And soo soo soo soo cheap!  Can't believe I'm eating on the Las Vegas strip type of cheap!  My favorites - the Original 1762 (soo much roast beef), The Full Montagu, and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. I'm sure anything you order here will be great - but those are my favorites.  Not just good at 4AM when you're drunk, stumbling through the deserted Miracle Mile shops of PH (which, by the way-resembles some sort of Zombie Apocalypse 4AM!) AND STILL good at 5PM the next day before a night of drinking.  

The key is the quality of the bread, the meat, and sauces.  The competition needs to take a page out of Earl of Sandwich's playbook - quality over quantity.  Generous portions of meat but NOT too much meat to overdo it. Not like those other sandwich shops that just serve you the side of an animal piled up between two small slices of bread.  . Earl of Sandwich serves the perfect amounts of meat, sauce and veggies.

The process is so streamline - the line may seem long but they have fulfillment down to a science so it moves fast.  Place your order, listen for your number - done!

A word of advice - if you are a big eater - order two sandwiches.  I'm not saying they're small by any means - but they are soo good and go down so easily - you'll be craving another.  TRUST me.",0,0,0

I settled for the Earl's Club. Turkey, bacon, hot cheese, and even grey poupon on the table. If there was one thing that could be a possible complaint, it'd be that it's a tad bit on the salty end. Because I had alcohol in my system, I enjoyed it; sober on the other hand, don't know about that.

I ordered the Italian sandwich which contains salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, ,mozzrella cheese, roma tomatoes and Italian dressing.  The sandwich was fresh and just melts in your mouth for $6.  The sandwich is average size, but someone with a big appetite will probably be hungry after one sandwich.  The meat and toppings were not that generous, but let's be real most food places in Vegas is pricey especially quality food, so this place is good for the price.

For dessert, I got the Vanilla brownie creme and it was good the first few bites, but it was really sweet and rich for me. You will lose the taste for it after a couple bites, UNLESS you have a major sweet tooth.  I just couldn't hang.

There doesn't seem to be any ""Earl"" like qualities about this place or the food for that matter.  The title of Earl is reserved for the aristocratic English nobility, and so it would seem that the sandwiches\/products may or would exhibit some kind of high quality.  
Yes, it's cheap but it just seems ordinary to me.  In fact, my entire dining experience was not very memorable at all.  It all seemed like a bad dream and I couldn't wait to wake up so to speak.

LOCATION:  Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.

There is one line that forms for the ordering counter.  Menus are displayed above the ordering station\/kitchen or near the waiting area for the line.  Various cold, hot and breakfast sandwiches available.  Admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu.  Sides and sodas (self serve) available as well.

After looking over their menu I finally decided on the pastrami reuben.  I honestly can't remember the sandwiches my two friends had since no one took pics or seemed satisfied with their food.  We all shared sides of chips, and potato and pasta salads.

FOOD:  
Just ok really.  My sandwich was just alright.  Priced at $6.49 I thought it would have been bigger and better (I'm really wishing I took a picture right now).  I think the three of us finished most of our food because we were hungry having decided to forgot breakfast that morning.  In any case, the food was somewhat acceptable.  The sides were just ok as well.

SERVICE:  
Not great.  And here's a tip:  you don't pay for your meal when you order your food.  The staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  We arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.  There was only one staff ringing up customer at the pay counter and it seemed that the other staff didn't care or want to help the poor guy out.  My friends and I waited what seemed like an eternity to pay for our food.  

side NOTE:  You can pick up sides, i.e. potato salad and chips, along the counter space between the order and pay stations.  

WHY?:  Why aren't there more seats or a larger seating area since this place seems to so popular??  

BOTTOM LINE:  I'm honestly not too sure why this place is so popular.  I thought it was alright.  There really should be a larger seating area for customers.",6,4,4

All of the sandwiches are great, but I HIGHLY recommend coming here during the holiday season (November-January) and getting the Turkey Holiday Sandwich. Envision this: creamy stuffing, cranberry dressing, yummy turkey, warm bready-saucey-Thanksgiving goodness sandwiched between two slices of heaven.

Was curious and went to try it. A big disappointment, and a regrettable meal choice. The giant, almost grotesque pile of par-baked white bread 'loaves' at Earl Of Sandwich are a huge turn-off - hide that nasty pale bread, guys! No whole wheat bread choice. White bread is all they've got - the sandwich nutritional equivalent of an iceberg salad. 21 locations across the USA and growing? You're going to stunt our growth, Earl! Please stop!

And, this is how they get 'cha: if you're hungry, you will want two (2) sandwiches, and that will set you back $12. These are relatively small sandwiches with very little going for them on the inside - under 2 oz. of meat, and no 'extra veggie' options. If you were to get a free sandwich on an AmTrak Train ride, this is pretty much the sandwich you would expect to receive.

Because of this experience, every time I am among the very slim pickings at Newark Airport Terminal A, I pick the Jamba Juice cart every time over the Earl Of Sandwich.

Upon arrival to this place, there was a long line.  There aren't many tables and seats for people to dine in.  This place is crowded, but it deserves it due to the deliciousness of their sandwiches.  

I tried the Tuna Melt here and it was enjoyable. For about $6 I was able to indulge in the soft freshly-baked bread and the warm tuna filling.  The sandwich isn't huge, but it does grant satisfaction to the taste buds and is very easy-going on the teeth and gum when I take a bite into it.  I also tried the ""Full Montagu"", which was not as flavorful.  It still was enjoyable and I can eat about 5 of it.  My favorite is the Italian sandwich, since there was a good amount of flavor in the salami and vegetables.  Overall, the sandwiches should be a little bigger and some of them need a kick in flavor.

My experience would have been better if they did not give us the wrong buzzer and made us wait 45 minutes for the sandwiches.  We were trying to be patient and waited for the sandwiches.  After 45 minutes, we decided to go back up and ask why they took so long. Then they explained the situation and made us fresh, new sandwiches.  In addition, they gave us a FULL refund.  Their level of dealing with customer concerns is awesome.",1,0,0

Seriously, if you're in vegas, and you haven't eaten here... TRY IT! you'll definitely fall in love... at least i did! This place is inside the Miracle Mile Shopping Center of Planet Hollywood! It's right across from the Sugar Factory. This place has earned the right to call itself the BEST SANDWICH SHOP IN THE WORLD!!! They're open 24 hrs. Each sandwich is only $5.99 and they're SOOOOO WORTH IT! 

Here's how it works:
You get in line, place your order. You'll receive a buzzing device that will notify you when your order is ready. You proceed along the line and pick up whatever else you want... like a potato salad, macaroni salad, cold slaw, chips, cookies, ice cream, etc. Then you get to the cashier, and pay for your order. You find a table and get your seat. Then your device will go off and you pick up your food. You come back to your table (if you're eating there... why not? cuz it'll be hot and fresh!) and divulge into a little piece of heaven. That's right! You will not be able to help yourself and will let out a small moan because it's that good! 

My fav is the Best BLT. For some reason, there's no sauce(i get it without mayo), no cheese or anything... but this place makes the sandwich JUICY! I dunno how that's possible! The Earl's Club is pretty good, too! That comes with turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes, and their special sandwich sauce. Let me just say, the tomatoes in this sandwich are sooooooooooo tasty. They're seasoned and super sweet! 

This place got everything right! Bread? Perfectly toasted! Meats? Nicely packed onto the sandwich! Lettuce and Tomatoes? Super fresh!

It's cheap and the only place within walking distance that even sells salads this early in the a.m. (they're open 24-hours), not to mention that I actually really ENJOY eating them. 

So I'm staying across the street at the Aria and I make the trek through City Center, across the bridge, through treacherous construction and finally through the PH casino all for this salad.

I didn't get my salad. 

The girl behind the counter said they weren't available. I assumed they were out of a vital ingredient since I've ordered this salad plenty of times at this hour. She said they might have the salad later that afternoon but I could order a wrap instead. I was mystified by this since they were the same ingredients but in a pita??? After pressing the issue I discovered that the reason she couldn't sell me the salad was they were out of the proper container. Seriously.

I asked if I could order it and have it served in cups or any other container they had available, I just really wanted the f***ing salad. She had the nerve to look at me like I was crazy!

She obviously isn't going to win any awards for creative problem solving but she not only lost a sale that day (and the whole rest of the weekend!) but she lost 2 stars as well.

The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & Earl's mustard) is near sandwich PERFECTION. If you need an extra kick, all the tables are stocked with grey poupon, which I'm a total sucker for. The bf had Cannonballs! (meatballs, marinara, mozzarella & parmesan cheese), which was a little salty, but still delish when hot. Then again, meatball sandwiches were never my thing.

If like me, you need your sandwich with a side of soup, this place offers a few soups to choose from. I had the broccoli and cheese soup, which comes with oyster crackers if you ask for them. It had nice bite-sized chunks of broccoli and wasn't too thick.

To finish it off, we tried the ice cream sandwich made with Ghirardelli chocolate. The top layer of brownie was good, but the ice cream wasn't creamy enough and the bottom layer was cake, which felt kind of cheap.

The best part about it is that the prices are totally reasonable and comparable to national sandwich chains. The sandwiches are all $5.95 and soups $2.95. And don't think you're going to get cheated with a shot glass of soup. It was an honest bowl-sized portion, and definitely more than what you'd get at the other chains.

I highly recommend the Caribbean Jerk Chicken - the banana peppers give it a slight kick and the jerk mayo makes the sandwich juicy and delicious. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. The sandwich doesn't come with cheese so I added cheddar cheese for $.50 and it was really worth it. It was hot and melted too yummm I want to go to Vegas right now to have another one of these!

Also made sure that I tried their soup (hey, I was hungry), and I got their chicken noodle. Yum, perfect chicken noodle. Didn't take away from the sandwich at all.

Another must order from there is the Tuna Melt. I told my friends that it was the ""super better"" version of McDonald's. Scratch that, this can't even compare to McDonald's. Once again the crunch from the toasted bread made this sandwich spot on.

I used to eat here all the time when I worked in Planet Hollywood, so when a friend and his dad wanted to grab a bite to eat at a reasonable cost I thought of this place. Dad was staying on Strip, so even though my buddy is local like me we both kinda drew a blank at first on what was close and not stupidly priced.
I remembered Earl of Sandwich as being moderately priced (decent sandwich prices considering portion but they get a little greedy when you look at the drinks. Whatever, its the resort corridor, nothing new.)  so I recommended them. It was a busy weekend night, lots of dumb half naked tourist girl herds to navigate through but knowing what I had before I felt it was kinda worth the twisted and intentionally confusing descent into Strip shopping hell.
When we finally got our order it was a shock for me.
48 bucks got one beer, two regular fountain drinks, a little cup of soup and three tiny little hot pocket sized sandwiches.
Ingredients were still pretty good and the sandwiches themselves, though pretty skimpy on everything especially meat were good also I was kinda blown away by the portion sizes.
It's a Tourist Joint now, and the prices and portions reflect that.
They're very efficient, food was fresh and hot, customer service fast paced and pretty normal vegas- polite... but they're a bit more brisk then they used to be.

However, since this was the last one that I ate, I was unable to finish.  The caribbean jerk is good for those who like their sammies a little spicy since it has the banana peppers.  And for a limited time, they're doing a chicken pesto sammy, that's not too bad either.  It stood out a little less for me, since it didn't have the sweetness of the Hawaiian nor the spiciness of the Caribbean.  I think my fave is still the montague, but that's b\/c I always prefer sliced meats to grilled chicken.

It's two slabs of bread with some meat stuffed between them, blegh. I could make it myself at home, for the low low price of free ninety nine. With the exception of a handful of places, for the most part, I avoid ordering sandwiches when dining out. 

Earl of Sandwich, is one of these exceptions. After eating nothing but buffets for the weekend, I desperately needed a change in the food scenery. Although I'm not super fond of sandwiches, the boyfriend and the bestie are so we stopped here for lunch on our last day in Vegas. 

Talk about a sensory overload. There are so many options to choose from--sandwiches, soups, and salads. But heellloooo, I'm here for the sandwiches! Okay, I lied, I also got a salad too--but more on that later. Although I wanted everything, because they ALL sounded that good, I ended up getting the Full Montagu because it has a little bit of everything, turkey, roast beef, swiss and cheddar? Yes, yes, yes and yes! The bread is perfectly toasted, and the meat is thinly sliced and amazingly tender. The melted cheeses not only added flavor but helped to keep the sandwich moist. Plus, I love mustard on anything, so yes again! At first glance, I found the sandwiches to be on the small side, but in hindsight, it was perfect! 

So in addition to the sandwich, I also ended up getting the Baja Chicken salad. Loved the packaging and the avocado, but this was just okaaaayyy, there was nothing special about it, and I probably wouldn't order it again. If you're thinking of add-on's for the meal though, I'd definitely do the brownie sandwich if you have a bit of a sweet tooth! 

If you're on the strip, Earl of Sandwich is definitely a must do! It's a great change of pace if you're sick of overeating at the buffets. Portions are reasonably sized, and prices aren't bad either. Your waistline will breathe a sigh of relief, and your wallet will thank you also!

The comments about the service are spot on, whoever is running this place obviously doesn't know the meaning of customer service, or just doesn't care that the service is rude, unfriendly, and completely uncaring about the customer's experience. I would think a restaurant on the strip in Vegas would be ready for a high turnover of new business and train staff to welcome new guests and help them through the process, this was a complete fail. I was not welcomed as I arrived during any of the three visits, the staff didn't waste a single friendly or helpful word beyond what was absolutely necessary to complete the transaction, and I don't remember a single thank you for my patronage.

I got 'the original' which is roast beef, cheddar and horse radish. It was delicious. A fair amount of all the ingredients and the roast beef was really tasty. The salad seemed very fresh (forgot the name) but had strawberries, blueberries, some almond slivers and something else, and it was a healthy portion with a nice light dressing.

We were both satisfied and it cost about 17.50 which isn't bad for Vegas. I honestly kind of wanted a second sandwich, they aren't as big as I wanted but for the price it's fair.

To start, I didn't know about the hype at all; I've never even heard of this place until my friends and I stayed at PH so I had no clue that it was kind of a big deal. I came in with an open mind (and a growling stomach) to say the least. 

I think what initially attracted me to this place was that its open 24 hours. The fact that I could get food from this place at any point of the day is a big plus, especially since it's Vegas. People tend to lose track of the time from all the booze hounding they do. I kind of did. Anyway, I recall seeing a huge line up during lunch time and I was quite intrigued. I decided to try it and see what it was all about. 

My first sandwich was the Full Montagu. Roast beef, turkey, swiss and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and this Earl's Mustard sauce. Holy orgasmo in my mouth. Not even joking, it was so delicious. The bread was nicely buttered and toasted, moist meat, crisp lettuce, velvety cheese... and that sauce! Mouthwatering. I think the price helped a whole lot too. I don't remember how much I paid for it exactly but I think it was somewhere around $7 or $8. So worth it. 

I was so happy with my initial purchase that I decided to come back the next day and bring my friend along. This time we got the BLT, the Hawaiian and the Tomato Soup. The BLT was a jacked up BLT, not in terms of size but in terms of taste. It was really good. The Hawaiian had a spicy, smoky, sweet taste to it which I really loved. Another home run. But the biggest surprise for me in this round was the Tomato Soup. I have never tried a tomato soup as good as the one I've had there. It was nice and silky and the croutons! Oh my damn those croutons... Wonderfully soaking in the rich tomato goodness. I paid around $10 for the BLT and the soup. It was so worth it; the sandwich and the soup were nice portions and really good.

Would I come back? Hell to the yes. Great food for a great price. So worth trying. I tell any of my friends that are going to Vegas to try this place. That's how impressed I was.",3,1,2

Maybe it's because I had a meat-free sandwich.  Maybe it's because I was here at 5:30 p.m. and not 3:30 a.m.  Whatever it was, I can't imagine myself going back unless it's the wee hours of the morning, I'm drunk, and I just so happen to be at Planet Hollywood.

I had the Caprese sandwich.  It was fine, but Slidin' Thru is at least 13 times better.  There was lots of mozzarella cheese and some fresh basil, but something about the sandwich didn't pop for me.  Plus I didn't get why it was heated.  It was the first time I had a hot Caprese sandwich and it just didn't feel right to me.

For the Strip, the prices are great.  For a local, the price is a buck or two more than it's worth.  Not huge, so if you're starving you may want to consider ordering two.

Was thinking about two stars since I was unimpressed and the employees were some of the most unsmiliest I've seen.  But I will give props to the more affordable Strip prices and for the fact that they gave me a free sandwich for my birthday.",2,2,1

The bread they use is fantastic, but they hardly put any fillings inside the sandwiches, and the fillings are not high quality. The photos of the sandwiches here on Yelp, and on the posterboards in the store, are totally misleading. On our 3 sandwiches, you couldn't even see the filling unless you opened them up. They are beyond skimpy on the meat and cheese. I was also disappointed that they didn't offer a pastrami sandwich, I found the rest of the selection very limited too. The prices are cheap, but the sandwiches are tiny, and are 90% all bread. Please, charge me more money, and give me better quality meat and cheese, and put a little more on the sandwich, so it is more than just a bread sandwich. Their holiday turkey and stuffing sandwich was inedible it was so bad. It had a funny taste to it, the stuffing was bad, and there was only one small clump of the cranberry on one spot on my sandwich. Try some fresh carved turkey, and not some pedestrian lunchmeat turkey. The two good things about this place are the bread, and they do make your sandwich quickly, but that is partly because they don't waste time putting much inside the sandwich itself. I had way better sandwiches at 2 other places in Vegas. I find it very interesting that people can be fooled into thinking a sandwich is a good, based on the bread alone. If you like good bread and tiny portions of tasteless meat and cheese, then this is the place. I make a better sandwich with my panini maker at home. I will only go back when I am in the mood for toast. The high ratings on this place, must be the result of some kind of mass hysteria, or people who were weaned on Subway sandwiches.",0,0,0

Earl of Sandwich gets the job done and serves mouth-watering decent sized sandwiches.  The sandwiches are all perfectly balanced with its different components.  The bread is really fresh and the whole sandwich just melts in your mouth.  It's so warm and gooey--I'm craving for it already just reminiscing about it!

The salads were really good too.  I tried the Mediterranean Caesar Salad and it was really good as well.  Make sure to tell them to go light on the dressing since they tend to put a lot in there.    

I also got to try their frozen lemonade which was pretty decent....but what makes it better is if you have extra vodka laying around....say at your room or in your pocket ...or your purse...Just splash some in there and BAM! you have a refreshing cocktail.

The Caribbean jerk chicken was also pretty good, with the same chicken but banana peppers and a spicy jerk sauce. I always love banana peppers in my sandwiches, so that was a good pairing with the chicken. The Hawaiian BBQ chicken was just average, especially because the pineapple tasted like canned pineapple.

I found out about this place through a friend while staying at PH. I expected nothing but a sandwich maybe a couple of notches above Subway. To my surprise I found a pot-o-gold delight sandwich! I ended eating here 2 or 3 times again during my entire trip! 

I tried the following Sandwiches: 
Thanksgiving Special Turkey Sandwich with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce. This gangsta was so good I think I'm just going to come to Vegas next Thanksgiving and eating at Earl! Wow... it was like a whole Thanksgiving meal inside the most delicious bread. I'm serious about Thanksgiving 2011 at Earl! 

The Original - Pretty normal sandwich but still very good quality. Must be the bread that is giving these bad boys such great quality. 

Spicy Chicken - This was my favorite! The peppers are fresh and spicy mixed in with the delicious creamy chicken and then the bread again. What a sandwich! 

Now I eat sandwiches at Vons or Subway quite often during work lunches and I only eat half a sandwich since a half fills me up. When I ate at Earl I ate the entire thing with no problem. I hope there's an Earl around in San Diego because I'll def. be a regular!",2,1,0

I came here twice, each for lunch, for my time in Vegas.

I got to share a Carribean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu with a friend of mine. I also got to try the tomato soup as well. I think my favorite that time was Carribean Jerk Chicken.

I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. A bit pricey considering the size of the sandwich itself. If you're a big eater, one sandwich definitely will NOT fill you up!

I was first introduced to these sandwiches when my family and I were exploring Plant Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops and the then ""new"" PH Westgate condos. We stopped by here after one of the hostess recommended it and I've been a fan ever since.

I enjoy the variety they offer, especially on their signature hot sandwich menu. I've had a couple and they are all tasty. These are a couple of my favorites, depending on what food mood I am in.

For a tasty well-rounded sandwich, I'd go with The Full Montagu (Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce).

For something tangy and sweet, I'd go with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce).

For something healthy and light I'd go with the Caprese (Fresh Mozzarella, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Drizzled Balsamic Vinaigrette).

One of my favorites remains the Italian because of my love for salami. (Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato (Peppers Optional).

A great place to eat, no matter what time of the day.

I'd also recommend their ice cream brownie sandwich because the brownie ""halves"" are rich and filling.",0,0,0

My son didn't like his non ""grilled cheese"" sandwich which looked more like a warm muffin with cheese in it and a bit dry I might add. My ham and cheese sandwich was ok didn't blow me away -- average at best. Prices I like but not the long wait, not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the crowd is what really killed it for me.

Another reason is that rarely frequent any sandwich chains to begin with,  although I used to go to Togo's all the time, and I briefly fell in love with Quizno's for awhile, but in these cases it was because they were one of my go to places near work...

The place seems to be popular, I'll give it that.  It's an inexpensive $6 value that you can pack to go and stands up pretty well if you want to bring it back to wherever you're staying in LV.  The toasty bread I guess is one of the best things about the sandwich, it reminds me of ciabatta bread because it's crusty and sort of sandy floury, but moistened by the oil or butter that they use to press the heated sandwich like a panini.  Efficient, they serve up the sandwiches like neatly packaged bricks in foil wrappers...

At first, I thought The Full Montagu was a play on words on The Full Monty, or maybe some Shakespearean reference -- was there also a Full Capulet sandwich (although it's really spelled ""Montague"");  no, actually it's in reference to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich with whom the sandwich is named.  I had one, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=3rHsnjWiJQIDCWMWE-mT1git was a two meat, two cheese sandwich consisting of roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, and cheddar, with lettuce, tomato, and mustard.  It was a very hardy sandwich and admittedly very satisfying.

We also had The Italian http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=IjSHtwUtQzJjGi2-6pBaWA and wifey had a more subdued Caprese. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=EXD7ciCNLGuEZNuPXdNYJA  They seemed to be satisfied with their choices...

Open 24 hours, I heard that this place is popular among the clubbing crowd as a late night snack.  To me this is still just a freakin sandwich place that isn't even a deli which I generally favor, but I would have to admit that it has a pretty successful following, and that being open at all hours for $6 is a pretty good value...",6,4,5

Earl's is located conveniently in Planet Hollywood next to the casino in PH's Miracle Mile of shops and restaurants, making it an accessible location 24 hours a day, after a nice walk around the strip or a long night of drinking and dancing at the club!

It is easy to be intimidated by the long line in front of the sandwich shop, but the line moves cafeteria style and the wait is never long to pay and place your order. There is plenty of seating and tables as well as a few TV's on the walls to watch the game. The wait to sit is never very long either as sandwiches are pretty much fast food!

I don't even like mustard but the Full Montagu turned me into a big fan! The chicken Caesar salad is delicious as well, with plenty of dressing, croutons, and chicken.

I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but I do recommend eating them while they're still warm! The bread is soft and chewy, and the cheese (if there is any) is perfectly melted.

My preferences:
* THE ORIGINAL 1762 [roast beef, cheddar, horseradish sauce] - the beef is SO tender. love the horseradish!
* ITALIAN [salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato, italian seasoning, italian dressing] - lots of meat!
* HOLIDAY TURKEY [turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce, mayo] - tastes exactly like you'd expect
* THE EARLS CLUB [turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, sandwich sauce] - classic\/sile sandwich, but you can't go wrong with bacon
* THE FULL MONTAGU [roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mustard sauce] - also pretty much a classic sandwich

Something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. Can never get enough. Please come to LA Earl!

_The original, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. I loved the horseradish sauce! It really made the sandwich stand out. Although a little too much meat for me. 
_The Full Montagu, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. Although it seemed a little too cheesy. I think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. But I'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. Luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.
_Chipotle Chicken avocado, grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. The chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. Every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. 
_Baja Chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. The salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. Nothing amazing. But good to share with a friend and half a sandwich.

HOWEVER, I am a strong believer that the statement does not apply to foods.

Now, upon the rave reviews I have heard from friends I encouraged the group I went with to try out this Sandwich shop. It's inside Planet Hollywood among a ton of stores and etc. The atmosphere is just very relaxed (either that or we were all too hungover to notice much. lol).  perfect location since my friends and I were staying at the Monte Carlo. And best of all, SLOT MACHINES right next to Earl's. What's not to love?

Now upon reaching this fine establishment, there was a very very long line. seriously. I was so doubtful about whether or not I actually wanted to wait in line. But I stuck it out anyways which I'm glad I did because MAN does that line go fast. Now, the sandwich isn't cheap. Mind you it costs $6.99 a sandwich but I had to try it. Plus, I was in Vegas, might as well.

I wanted to go with the basic because I am a true believer that if you can't make a basic sandwich taste amazing, then you're not a very good sandwich shop. So I ordered the classic Earl's Club without the tomato. Within minutes, it was done and i was down to chow. And chow chow chow I did. Oh my god. seriously. One bite was all it took for me to swoon. A warm soft cheesy sandwich. Perfect amount of roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss, lettuce & sandwich sauce. and my GOD! the bread they used was so soft but not so soft so that the sandwich falls apart. I downed half the sandwich down in seconds. It was THAT good.

Now I know i know. I can be totally biased since I only got the club sandwich but my friend ordered the very festive holiday sandwich that had cranberries in it (don't remember the actual name since i didn't order it). Now i'm usually not a big fan of having cranberries in my food. Something about a pang of sudden cranberry makes me kinda twinge. But my man Earl has proved me wrong. Even that sandwich was amazing. I took a few bites out of it just to try it out. I wanted to gobble that up as well (obviously I didn't considering it was my sandwich).",0,0,0

I only live about 20 minutes from Disneyland, but I would rather have my first taste of an Earl sandwich in Las Vegas, the one that it is known for! 

I wish I was more hungry for a sandwich since Earl is known for that, but I opted to go a little healthy & asked for the berry salad which came with strawberries, blueberries, spinach, chicken, and almond slivers. Those ingredients itself was already calling my name. Maybe because mine was a salad that I did not find it to be that memorable as everyone claims Earl to be. The salad was fresh and the fruits were even better, but it was just quite plain and ordinary for me. My darling had the Full Montagu which had roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. I took a bite, and it was yummy, but seemed kind of like an ordinary sandwich to me. Hmm.

I really do want to give Earl another chance, perhaps the one at Disneyland next time, and I will update this review again once I try one of their special sandwiches to myself x",2,3,2

Located in Planet Hollywood, the lines were long during lunch but it moved quickly.  The ordering process is quick and painless and finding a seat can be a tad bit hard during their peak hours but never impossible.   We ordered the All American sandwich, Full Montagu, Chicken Wrap, and the Berry Salad.  

The All American Sandwich was absolutely delicious and flavorful with roast turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and cranberries.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the cranberry added an extra sweetness to the sandwich which made it a little bit more heavenly.   Please order this during your first time here. 

The Full Montagu sandwich was good but not great.  Consisted of beef, turkey, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard sauce.   The meat was a bit under-seasoned and the whole sandwich tasted a tad bit bland and light.  The Chicken, Berry, and Almond salad was good.  The whole combination of almond, berry, chicken, and lettuce was good.  The vinaigrette that comes with it was also decent and I would probably order it again if I needed a side of salad to balance out my meal.

Well, after our recent trip to Vegas, we ended up eating here 3 times because it was just so easy, tasty, and reasonably-priced by Vegas standards. 

You really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, but try some of different sides besides chips. Their soups are delicious and are a pretty good size. I tried the tomato and Wisconsin Cheddar and both were hearty and delish. Their macaroni salad is also good and tastes homemade. The brownie creme sandwich is amaaazing (I love the one with white filling). But my favorite thing to get here is the frozen lemonade - it's tart, refreshing, and a nice break for your liver from all the drinking in Vegas. 

I wouldn't say this is the best sandwich place I've ever been, but here's why I think it's so popular: for two people you can get a lot of food here for around $20...which, in Vegas, is hard to do.

Earl's bread has the right amount of crispy crunch and soft dough to compliment the contents of the sandwich.  Everything else seems fresh but I wasn't exactly BLOWN away.  Like I said, for Vegas, yes, this is damn good. I've had better sandwiches in the OC and LA in California BUT I'll give it to Earl's for being the best in Sin City.

Tried the Full Montagu (beef, turkey, cheddar\/swiss cheese, etc.) and it was good, but not my fave. Solid sandwich, though.

Also, their Tomato Bisque -- UM, AMAZING.  I felt so sick after my Vegas trip and had to have soup at Earl's. Best decision during my trip, EASY. Their garlic croutons added the perfect kick to the tomato flavor (which tasted so homey, omg). Rich and slightly creamy... perfect for the weak stomach :)
