Here at Holsteins you will find the finest spiked milkshake In Vegas.  You will find a line-up of shakes spiked or non-spiked (spiked as in with alcohol). Whichever you milkshake you may choose these are a meal in themselves. 
Come thirsty & come hungry. Why? Riddle me this, how can one not order a shake AND one of the burgers...along with a side.  burgers are always consistently cooked just as I ordered. Not undercooked, nor over cooked.  No frozen hamburger buns here, no frozen fries here!  Vegans, they do have a 'burger' patty for you, with black beans and a variety of veggies:)
Go ahead. Do it. Just do it.  Regret it later when you feel the need for a nap. Food coma anyone? ;)",1,1,1

Service spotty, food didnt come out as ordered. Some food came out ten minutes before others and we only had a party of 4.

We came in to grab a late lunch. To start things off we ordered the Korean 'Bulgogi' Quesadilla. We certainly did not need an appetizer, but it sounded to good to pass up. It comes stuffed with marinated steak, kimchi, asadero cheese, chili aioli & kalbi glaze. Luckily it tastes as good as it sounds. It is good for 2 to 4 people. The flavors are great. You can taste each of the ingredients and they all bring something good it.

For my meal I chose the Nom Nom Burger. It comes with Kobe Beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. That list tells you everything you need to know about why I ordered it. The burger is large and filling. I was unable to finish it off. That being said, it was quite tasty. You get all the great flavors from the ingredients plus the added texture of the potato chips. The burgers also come with fries. The fries are good. They have good flavor and are the right amount of crisp.

We had to try the Bam-Boozled Shakes as well. Neither of us needed the additional food, but they sounded so good. I ordered the Red Velvet Cake Shake. It comes mixed with Zing Red Velvet Vodka, red velvet cake, cream cheese mousse and a mini whoopee pie. Yep, it was good. You get all the great flavor of red velvet with a little booze mixed in. The portion is large. It is a meal unto its self.

This is a good lunch or casual dinner spot. You could also stop in for a shake at any time. It is worth it.",7,5,7

As a vegetarian (I eat some fish) I had studied the menu ahead of time to make sure there was enough food for me to eat. I was beyond excited to try the birthday shake and was not disappointed one bit, it was the perfect shake\/cake combo! WOW! My friends tried the peppermint and chocolate banana shakes also and they were all fantastic. I'm not sure there is much booze actually in them but I really wanted it more for the shake factor!

We ordered some appetizers, I had both the lobster truffle mac and cheese and the calamari, both were excellent. The mac and cheese was amazing, I could have easily ordered that for dinner and been satisfied. 

After the appetizers I should have called it quits (I was full enough and extremely satisfied) but I decided to order the vegan burger and shoestring fries, the vegan burger was good, piles of avocado on top which I love but the patty wasn't anything special. I've had better vegan patties.....the avocado though was AWESOME. The fries were cooked perfectly also. 

My boyfriend and mom both had the surf n turf sliders, I did not try these but both of them said they are well worth the price tag.....

Overall the prices were decent for Vegas, not too expensive and definitely enough food to fill us up for dinner. I definitely recommend the restaurant!!",1,0,0

A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.

We ordered simple little meals as follows:
Red Stripe - $7
Dragon Fruit Drink - $10
Black and White Shake - $8
Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9
Truffle Lobster $16.50
Pizza Twinkies $12
Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9

The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. 
The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  

The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack. 

I tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.",11,8,10

1-Lobster Mac & Cheese - Lump chunks of lobster in a decant creamy mac and cheese sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

2 - Pizza Twinkie - mozzarella cheese and pepperoni in a twinkie type of dough - deep fried with tomato dipping sauce. Grown up pizza rolls - Yum!

3 - Fried Pickles - Nothing more to say - they speak for themselves.

4 - Lobster Filet Tiny Bun - Two tiny burgers that are made with filet mignon and topped with lobster. 

5 - Blue Cheese Kettle Chips with French Onion Dip - These were a bit average. Would not get these again. I could have bough the chip and made the onion dip at home for the same or less price.

When we arrived, there were four young ladies (staff) at the hostess stand talking to each other.  We were asked how many in our party, but they didn't shift to customer service mode very quickly. Our party of four stood there awkwardly for a bit before being seated.  

It took a bit for our server to show up to the table, but he was friendly and helpful when he did.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and the Yelp check in for a free (house) beer (when you order a burger).  After we ordered, he delivered the house popcorn that had a little spice kick to it...pretty good stuff.   

We didn't have silverware and napkins... not sure which staff is responsible, but neither the hostess who seated us nor our server noticed.  We had to get up and ask for it from someone after our popcorn was brought to the table (hence, we'd been there a while)...

I had the Rising Sun, an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado - cooked a little rarer than my requested medium well, but fine with me.  It was pretty tasty!!

Two people ordered the lobster mac - one said it was okay and one said it was really good.

I walked past Holsteins thinking that it would be like a TGI Friday's or something.  The appearance of the place was relaxed and that's just the type of food and menu I expected.  Boy was I wrong, this place is gourmet burger mecca with a very beer and wine menu to choose from.

Our group was seated quickly and we decided to order drinks.  Good new Cider beer fans, you have 3 options to chose from hear and I can now confirm that they are all delicious.  The raspberry cider was the best I think!  They have an extensive beer and wine list as well, so whatever your heart desires is available.

Appetizers were both good, we had Redneck Poppers and the wings.  Poppers were very unique and good, I would order those again for sure.  The wings were very spicy so if you like the feeling of your lips burning, then this is the place for you.

For dinner I had the Longhorn Burger, that's bbq pulled pork on a beef patty.  It was very messy to devour but was good eats for sure!  I didn't get any cole slaw on my burger because I don't like it but usually this burger comes with it.  I also ordered steak fries, they were plain old steak fries but are always a favorite of mine.

First of all, this place is REALLY LOUD. So be warned that if you are going there to converse with others...I wouldn't suggest coming here. Don't get me wrong, I love that the DJ had tons of enthusiasm but the volume of the music was just too loud. 

Our server was Jonathan, who seemed to be a really cool guy when he first introduced us. I personally felt really rushed to order our drinks. This is where the first problem arose...we wanted a plain vanilla milkshake and his snarky response was that ""all the shakes have vanilla"" so after we place our order for an oreo milkshake, we see on the menu that they have plain vanilla, chocolate, and other standard flavors. When we saw this we obviously confronted us and told him we just wanted the vanilla. He said that ""the order was already placed and as he was bringing us our other drinks he was literally blending it"" I'm not sure about you folks but when you are in the food and beverage industry, shouldn't you be attentive to the customers needs? Not sure if he was purposely trying to get a higher check average since the standard milkshakes were $3 less but anyways. I thought this was extremely rude of him to say that the milkshake was already being blended so we couldn't change our order when he wouldn't let us order what we wanted in the first place. The milkshake was yummy, but the principle.

When we asked about other menu alternatives he laughed and said ""you know this is a burger place right?"" Well excuse me...but if I remember correctly the right side of the menu had quesadillas, tacos, and a variety of other things. Who would have known it was such a crime to ask such a question.

Another thing that really tickled me was that during the meal, the fire alarm went off and NOBODY was evacuating. Yes, we probably should have taken it a little more seriously and at least gotten up to check what was going on but is it just me or is it illegal for them to not even make an effort to evacuate us while a fire alarm is going off?

We ordered the chicken wings to start and I had the Longhorn burger  for my main; and although it was extremely tasty, I didn't think it was anything to write home about (except the steak fries, yum) Ultimately, I would have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that the service here is extremely slow, with just average food. I think next time I'll have to make the drive to Bachi Burger.

Aside from that 2 minute expericence, this place is truly worth trying.",0,0,0

A short way into our burgers (Longhorn burger for me with brisket, cole slaw and pickles; a mushroom and gruyere burger for David) we said, wow, these are possibly better than any place except Umami burger. As the meal went on, we decided Holsteins was giving even the venerable Umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money. It was that good. I got the Longhorn burger because I love BBQ, even though I thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly. It wasn't. The brisket was sliced thin, and was a bit crisp - almost like a super delicious bacon. And best of all, the BBQ sauce was not cloyingly sweet. A minor criticism, I thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant - maybe the quantities need adjusting. David was similarly pleased with his burger, every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms. One of us got fries and the other onion rings, both were good. Service was first rate. We didn't try the shakes. We were very impressed.",1,0,1

I also how they put kimchee slaw and egg in it! Second time here, I had the ahi-sliders, which comes with seared ahi tuna, asian slaw and chili mayo. I asked for mine without the slaw because I don't want that extra gas while lounging later haha. But yes, even without the slaw, those sliders are delicious! I really like the chili mayo that it comes with it. I ordered sweet potato fries, which was a bit bland, but those mayo definitely spiced it up. I also ordered a redbull vodka here, and boy, it's pretty strong stuff. 

The waitresses here are all very nice and cute. Their outfit kind of reminds me of Hooters except with longer shorts.

Read so many outstanding reviews, but maybe they were just having a bad day. Still a great outstanding restaurant shouldn't have bad days they should be consistent considering these reviews. 

Well here's my opinion...I ordered the big fat Greek which consisted of course of the lamb burger, feta cheese, thaziki sauce, and lettuce. First let's start off with the lamb cooked medium rare please as i stated to the waiter. The waiter had informed me the cook did not like cooking it that way so I said ok medium. No biggie as long as I had the beautiful pinkness in the middle. So as I got my burger it was cooked to well done!!! Wtf. The feta cheese and sauce tasted weird.  The bun tasted cardboardish. Ewww! The waiter came back and saw how my burger was cooked he was nice enough to apologize and explained to me how the chef really does not like to undercook the lamb. Um ok opposed to overcooking the crap out of it. What a damn shame!! Worst lamb burger. I had a better tasting lamb at mad Greek. Lol! But this does not even hold a candle to black hog in Los Angeles. Best lamb burger by far there. So let's continue I ordered my side of shoestring fries. It came in a cute mini silver looking pail\/bucket. So gross it was so freaking hard. And you know when you eat hard crunchy salty potatoes it kind of leaves the upper roof of your mouth raw and beat up.

I know I wasn't the only one complaining about my meal, bc the girls at the next table complained to our waiter that their burger was burnt!!! Really people!? Please reevaluate this chef dude and figure out why he is overcooking the meat and the fries. Yucky!!! 

Now about the service the waiter was nice but didn't refill our drinks once... And the tables around us were complaining asking where's our waiter. It wasn't even crazy busy either. It died down in the middle of our meal. 

Wow. Now thinking about this review three stars is way too generous. Well I will leave it to three stars due to the awesome artsy stuff on the walls. Love the decor and interior design. That part was dope. If it was based only on food and service alone 2 stars. Step up your game HOLSTEINS! Not good grub folks.",3,0,0

It was a Monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. We chose to sit in the lounge and I was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.

We started with a Drunken Monkey and a Black Cow. My bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the Monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. I doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. Both shakes were really delicious, and my Black Cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because I could taste cherry pretty well. The menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, I think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.

We also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or fried pickles, but we can get those everywhere in Florida, so we went with what would be more unique. They were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.

Burger-wise, I had the Rising Sun and the bf had the Gold Standard, both cooked medium. The Rising Sun did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). The avocado was a little unwieldy, and I would have preferred a few thin slices. I didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but I guess I get the appeal.  The Gold Standard was almost completely devoured by the time I got a bite, so I guess he enjoyed it. Both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, I couldn't stop eating either of them. Super crispy and delicious.

I can't think of any reason to give Holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the Strip) and the fact that there isn't one in Orlando.",2,0,3

Down: Waiter comes to table. He's looking a bit distracted ""Hi I'm ---. I'll be back in a second"" - disappears for a few.
Up: Waiter comes back. Gets our orders. We get water. Yay!
Up: Our milkshake comes out with a GIANT ice cream cookie on top. The milkshake is delicious although I wish the cookie was warmer\/softer.
Up: Our food comes out! Look at those beautiful burgers!
Down: Where our the onion rings that we got instead of fries?
Down: Poutine - overrated. Not enough curds. Skip the extra egg.
Up: Our friend's burger was cooked perfectly medium - pink in the middle and according to her, very juicy.
Down: Our burger, also ordered medium, was cooked to well down with zero signs of pink. Since we were on a time crunch to catch a show, we didn't want to bother trying to find our waiter and send this puppy back. But it was dry dry dry. The saving grace was that we added an egg which helped to moisten the patty.
Down: Bill comes out and the beer is a different price than what was on the menu. Not the waiter's fault since some of the 'old' menus with the 'old' prices were mixed in with the 'new' menus. Minor quibble but at this point, we were a tad annoyed with all the mix ups.

The fiance ordered an oreo shake, which was yummy. We ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but not the best I'd ever had. The blend of cheeses was nice and creamy, with a little sharpness, and the truffles really added to the dish. The lobster in the mac n cheese, however, did not taste like it was very high quality.

The fiance ordered the duck duck goose burger, which neither of us were very impressed with. He ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were awful and completely inedible. They were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them.

I ordered the gold standard burger, which was honestly the saving grace of this restaurant. It was the best burger I've had in my life, and despite all the other problems we had with the food here, I would definitely go back for that burger. I ordered a side of duck fat fries.

- I ordered the steakhouse burger. Medium rare beef patty, with steak sauce, marmalade onions, mushrooms, and swiss cheese. The beef was bland but overall the burger was decent.

I really liked this place. To me it was fun. Cute and different ideas make this place worth checking out. Its not gonna blow your socks off but I think you'll have a good time if you're not too serious about everything. They try  - at being gourmet, hip, boozy, and on-trend - and they do all of that decently.

We had no issues with service, but it was a Monday that we stopped in. So take that for what its worth. Nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.

Drinks - This is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. They make what they call ""adult vitamins"" which are drinks that use Vitamin waters as their bases. Basically Vitamin water plus vodka\/gin and some additional fruit juices. I know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  They were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. They were fairly strong. They also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  If I'm ever back at this place, I'll probably try one of these out. 

Food - Mostly burgers and variations on the concept. They make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  I appreciate the attempt, but I do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers. 

Anyways, I had the ""Classic"" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. It was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and juicy. The patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttery. The Classic is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  You can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (fried egg, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc).

Blame the torrential down pour of Goose and Tonics from the the previous night for my lack of memory. However this review is more than fuckin' helpful. The duck fat fries are no longer on the menu. So you novelty food seeking bastards are in for a rude surprise. See, bishes....helpful. Suck on it. 

The kimchi quesadilla is good and spicy, but you might be hard pressed to find it worth the $14. Not me, I just refinanced my 1995 Maserati. So I'm good with the loot.

Gold Standard with steak cut fries: The burger came out perfectly constructed and everything looked proportioned from the top to bottom. Looked like a ""Lbs Burger or Bachi Burger"".. Well, come to find out this place was related to ""Lbs"", same chef.. It came with Dry Aged Beef Sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic-chive aioli on a kinda sweet bun.. The medley of flavors worked pretty well but just like ""lbs"" and even Bachi burger, I was not blown away. Just merely satisfied.. The burger patty wasn't that flavorful but had a nice texture. It was all the supporting toppings that gave it some life. Overall, it just didn't do it for me..

Steak cut fries: Awesome! Delicate light crunchy skin and inside had a crumbly fine mashed potato textured consistency. Loved it!

I googled ""Best Burger in Vegas"" and tried to pick the best combination of highly rated and near my hotel. I was not disappointed with my selection.

Holsteins has a pretty solid beer selection. There were probably a dozen beers on tap, and they had a decent bottle list as well with selections ranging from the standard (Budweiser) to the slightly fancier (Chimay Blue). I read a lot about the milkshakes, but it sounded like too much paired with a burger, so I opted out.

I got the Nom Nom burger and added avocado. It came out a perfect medium rare (as requested). I was considering The Rising Sun but wanted something a little less complicated. The burger itself was tender and well-seasoned. The bun was soft and buttery (how I like them). All-in-all, it was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Very rich and flavorful. I got onion rings instead of fries, and they were pretty good as well but nothing special.

Some of the more negative reviews on here might have to do with price, and while I also am reluctant to spend $18 on a cheeseburger, it's Vegas and should be expected. I also shouldn't be paying $8 for a Weihenstephaner when it's usually $10 a 6 pack...

Golden Standard burger- is pretty much a typical burger with better ingredients. 

The Rising Sun burger- omg... It was described by our waitress Tess as a sushi burger without the fish taste. She also said it was her favorite, so I had to give it a try. It is so well flavored, every bite was delicious. 

Fries- nothing special. Actually on the soggy side...they taste in comparison to McDonald's fries. 

Strawberry shake- NA version was tasty with an extra amount that doesn't fit into the glass on the side. So basically, two people can share this shake. 

The prices are high! Both burgers were $18.5 each and the NA shake was $9. $18.5 for a burger and fries... I would at least expect the fries to be just as amazing as the burger. They have onion rings and sweet potato fries as an option for a couple bucks more.",4,1,1

The popcorn in buckets while you wait definitely help settle your stomach down a bit. It's so delicious, and I never thought a higher-end restaurant pulled off popcorn as an appetizer so well.

The other reason they don't have five stars is because of their service. It always seems to take forever to get things. Whether with three people, or a group of high schoolers, it always takes forever.

The Fun-ghi was absolutely to die for. The burger was cooked to perfection. Like always, I get by burgers medium rare. Tasty, juicy, and perfect. And that's just how the burger came out. While I didn't have a shake while I was here, that is in the cards for the next time I'm back.

I was seated out by their full service bar and a server was with me very shortly. She was polite, had great beer recommendations, and checked in frequently to make sure I was doing alright.

I'll start off by saying that I'm not a burger person. I KNOW STOP JUDGING MEEEEE. Despite that, I really enjoyed our meal here. 

Service
I can see how the wait here can be frustrating during peak hours, but my ninja skills paid off because instead of waiting we were able to snag one of the lounge tables instead. Although, it didn't really matter because the host ended up calling my cell phone within 15 minutes. Our server was very sweet and attentive. 

Atmosphere
I love the open feel of this restaurant! It's fun and inviting. 

Food
Remember all those times you worked out so you can look great in a bikini while strutting your stuff at EBC? Well, all of that goes right out of the window once you step foot into Holsteins!! Calories? What's that??

I'm pretty sure that I was teary eyed once I took a sip of their Red Velvet shake. I mean seriously alcohol mixed with red velvet cake?!? What else can you possibly need?? I seriously would rather sit at Holsteins sipping on their shakes instead of being in a cramped club. 

Of course, because I obviously care about my arteries, I ordered the nom nom burger. It has potato chips and thousand island dressing inside.

When we arrived at around 10:30 pm, the place wasn't packed at all (I was told night life begins really late in Vegas) and my boyfriend and I were seated in a nice corner by ourselves. The decor was really creative and modern, and the couches were comfortable to sit in. 

Our waiter was very welcoming and nice, and he provided us with recommendations on what to eat. I went with the rising sun burger (about $18) and a cookies and cream and boozy shake ($15, which comes with the most delicious chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich) and I loved it! So much flavor in that rising sun burger, given it has flavors characteristic of sushi and Japanese food (since it has the teriyaki and spicy mayo and tempura avocado). The meat was cooked more on the well-done side versus medium-well that I asked for, but I totally did not mind. Awesome burger!!

Now, for the best part- the boozy shake! Man, the cookies and cream was such a delight and they even bring you extra ice cream shake in a tin, so you get a lot of bang for your buck, in my opinion. I got a few sips of the grasshopper shake, as well, and it is incredible (if you like mint ice cream, get it!)! The shakes have the perfect combination of sweet with some alcohol and yummy treats they cover the shakes in (like chocolate crispies, whipped cream, other desserts, etc.), so take your time reading all the different kinds to find the one that suits your taste best. 

Overall, I would say the price we paid for the food we got was worth it! And they have military discount so I was able to get 15% off my check.

Aside from the milkshakes (the regular chocolate was good too), the burgers are delicious. I believe I've had The Gold Standard Burger, which, along with the fries and a pint, made for a great meal. Good presentation on the food and drinks, too.

I ate here with my family for a birthday celebration, and was impressed with the food that we got.  The menu is setup interestingly and can be a little confusing at first.  We got some pretty good flavored popcorn as a little appetizer.

The kids menu is simple and decent as my son had two mini burgers with fries.  The burgers were good and the fries are well prepared.  I would like a softer bun on the mini burgers though.  Fried green tomatoes are OK and not worth the price in my opinion (worst thing we ordered).  My wife had the ""Gold Standard"" burger with sweet potato fries as no duck fat fries were offered.  The aged beef was really good and the burger had great flavor overall (4 stars).  I actually like the buns they use for the burgers as they are somewhat soft and taste good.  She also had the ""Power Shake"" which was amazing as it was a good mix between shake and drinking yogurt (5 stars).  I ordered the Rising Sun burger with onion rings and a Brown Cow (Root beer float with pop rocks).  The burger was great but overcooked as I wanted medium and got medium well (4.5 stars).  Onion rings were a disappointment as I expected better (3 stars).  If you want a good dipping sauce ask for the spicy mayo used in the Rising Sun burger and add a little Ketchup to it for a good sauce for your fries and onion rings.  The Brown Cow was really good as they use a good root beer and ice cream for it (4 stars).  You get a lot of shake which is nice and the pop rocks are kind of fun addition to the drink.  

Holsteins has decent service great shakes and some great hamburgers.  If the price and some of the items were better I would give this place five stars, but with some OK items and a somewhat hefty price I give them four stars.

Came back the next day for lunch.  We did not receive any popcorn like the other tables... Is that saying something?  We ordered shakes, fries, and wings.  Nothing else looked that appetizing.  Yeah my shake packed a kick but was soooo overly sweet- cremee brûlée.  My sister got the oreo- it tasted good.  The wings were alright and the fries were a mixture of soggy and burnt.

This is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  The Menu is sharp and creative.  Holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.

We had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers I have ever eaten...EVER.

I started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. We ordered the BILLIONAIRE BURGER $28 Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo and the GOLD STANDARD Burger   $17.5 Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli.
I told our slightly slow server several time MAKE SURE THE BURGERS ARE MEIDUM-RARE.  

After a 40 minute wait time, the burgers arrived, and they looked AMAZING.   I took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. Slightly alarmed by the burning feeling I removed the bun to see what was going on.  The entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  Apparently NO ONE bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at Holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  My rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.  

What I received was far from a medium-rare burger.  The greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  I asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of the burger I had taken one bite of.   Confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. After waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the ""Size of Fie-Gras varies in each burger""  ....the question is by how much?  

In an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, I ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  The server told me that it would be $20 extra which I told him was clearly not a problem. It arrived 20 minutes later once the burger was cold.  Once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger. 

To be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained. 

 The service is sub fast-food quality.  Our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.   

Overall, I would never go back and have Holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.",1,0,0

The lobster macaroni and cheese may have been the best thing I've ever eaten in Vegas. It came with a mini lobster roll (not mentioned on the menu) and included a slice of bacon. When I told our server I wasn't expecting that and that I don't eat bacon, they brought me another mini sandwich sans bacon. While we're on the service, Porsha was awesome. She offered to split all our checks before and kept everyone's tabs in order. Smiled the whole time and was super friendly about recommendations.

The Frozen Grasshopper was like drinking the last of your Thrifty's mint chip ice cream. It was a tasty shake, but maybe not worth $11, $7 or $8 at best even with the Frangelico in there. 

I also had the sliders, two tasty lil bundles of joy. The only knock on this place is on the homemade potato chips that came with them. I must have got some from hours ago because they were cold and rubbery. I bet a fresh & crispy batch would be very good there and would be great with any burger.

My burger was the longhorn which comes with coleslaw and brisket on it.  I asked for mustard thinking I would need it, but nope!  The burger was juicy and so full of flavor.  Writing this review makes me want to eat one right now!  Also the size of the burger was great.  It wasn't massive like Red Robin, basically normal size.  For me, thats what matters, a great burger that doesn't need its size to make it great!",0,0,0

I honestly don't think I'd go back to this place just for the fact that there was a DJ playing in the restaurant. I understand that there's a club a few doors down, but having the DJ in the restaurant is obnoxious. A good restaurant to me does not include head pounding techno music, screaming at the people I'm with and barely being able to understand them even then. If you're into that, go for it. I'm guessing that it's not like that during the day and if it isn't I'd be willing to try it again.",0,0,0

I looooved their inventive, playful milkshakes! Though I was tempted by the more adventurous concoctions... I'm a simple girl at heart and ended up ordering their version of a rootbeer float. It was taaaasty and the pop rocks sprinkled on top were a fun reminder of the simpler times. And, most importantly, I confirmed that if you drink soda and have pop rocks your stomach will not explode.

The burgers are a-okay. Premium, restaurant burgers that are good and some pretty interesting combos. But, in the end, they were just okay. I actually went with the veggie patty. It was pretty tasty. Made in the kitchen, not some boca burger slapped on a bun. But, still... it was just alright. 

OH. And... TRUFFLE LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE. Yum. We actually asked them to leave the plate with the leftover sauce and... um... used our fries to soak up the bechemal and truffle. SO good.

The waiter was on top of it and not intrusive at all.  He was one of those that came around at the perfect time to either give us refills, ask us how our meal was going, or even the simple things like getting our check taken care of but then not rushing us out of the restaurant (as there did seem like there was a wait to get seated and the restaurant was packed).  We came at 11am for an early lunch on a weekday but by the time we left at 12:45 it sure was heating up.

We each ordered our own burger and a beer and also added the oreo and peanut butter boozy milkshakes at the end.  As you can probably tell we were extremely full but we pushed through due to the overall deliciousness.  The meal began with complimentary pizza seasoned popcorn and then our burgers and beers were next.  We each ordered a different burger (gold standard, rising sun, and caliente) and each added a fried egg (because why not).  The upgrade price for the sides was a little excessive at $2.50 for a side salad substitution, already on top of a $20 burger, but it is what it is.  Each burger was great and definitely required a fork and knife once the egg broke.  The milkshakes were a spectacle.  Not much booze in them but delicious nonetheless.  They really are a sight and sharable as you get the milkshake in all its glory in the main glass plus extra milkshake liquid on the side.

This is one of the better upscale burgers in Vegas.  It certainly matches the likes of Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay elsewhere on the strip.  Great venue for a long lunch to meet up with acquaintances on the strip.",0,0,0

Also, maybe my memory is foggy, but I feel like a lot of the stuff is so much saltier than it was before.

I still think this is a solid spot for burgers, and the alcoholic milkshakes are still to die for. In my last review I mentioned the Drunken Monkey, Frozen Grasshopper, Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, and the Coffee and Donuts; I'll add the Red Velvet to that list. I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the Bananas Foster milkshake, though. It was just too sweet - which probably seems like a silly complaint given the subject matter - but given how much of a sweet tooth I have, I'm going to guess then that it is way too sweet for most people.

It took too long for our orders to be put in (drink, apps, and main!)

We also didn't get drink refills regularly (and our server seemed a little bothered to be bringing refills anyway).  One thing I didn't like is that they don't clear the glasses after the refill so our table was getting filled with glasses. 

Our server also forgot to put in my mom's salad so she sat there without food for the entire time the rest of us were eating.   Instead of apologizing or explaining the server just hid in the corner.   When my mom got her salad, we could tell it was on the fly because the ahi on it was disgusting.

When we got there the hostess made us wait because she said many tables have been booked for months so she wasn't sure which one we could have.  When we were finally sat we ordered red sangria.

My girlfriend and I decided to spend Xmas in Las Vegas.  We stayed at The Cosmopolitan because it's a Marriott Autograph Collection property, and it was basically free.  As we were walking through the hotel, checking out all the places to eat, we saw Holstein's and decided to drop in.  The burger I had was really good, but could have used a little less salt.  I forgot the name, but it was some sort of teriyaki or something like that.  Nice flavor combinations.  I ate the whole thing and was completely full, not even needing to eat dinner that night.  I thought I'd start off by having their vegan raspberry shake.  It seems odd to have a vegan shake with a burger, but there's a reasoning here.

They brought the shake out, and my eyes widened.  The joy of having a shake, something I haven't done since I was 12, was amazing.  The raspberry sorbet and soy whipped topping were a delightful combination.  The shot of alcohol in it wasn't noticed, but I'm sure it was there.  If you're looking to get a buzz, you'd need 3-4 of these.

The server was excellent.  She was attentive to our needs, brought the orders promptly, and as far as we knew, they were correct.  She kept checking in on us, without being annoying, and basically did a great job.

That's easily a three star, maybe even a four star review.  Why the cut to two?

Apparently they don't know what vegan means.  I'm not a vegan, but I am severely sensitive to dairy.  This shake had whipped cream instead of soy whipped topping.  I wasn't positive...it could have been something else I ate that day, and the great flavor of that shake was something I needed to try again.  I braved it, ordered the same shake, and had the same violent reaction.  Nothing else I ate that second time several days later was the same.  I was vigilant in seeing I had nothing dairy.  I'm deeply disappointed in the restaurant serving something labeled as vegan, when it clearly has an animal product (dairy).",1,0,0

Holstein's though, came pretty close. But I think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal. 

You see, I had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. I knew going in that I wanted that Billionaire Burger, with its truffle aioli and foie gras, elements of a burger I know I would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. I did order it. And then some. That burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. It was luscious.

But like I said, it wasn't fair. I made it luxurious because I willed it. Is the law of attraction in action? Perhaps. More than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.

The philly cheese steak egg rolls were average. Nothing memorable or special.I also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the Tiramisu and the Fat Boy. Most gush about The Fat Boy but it was too candy-like for me. Boyfriend had the Memphis Burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. I had a bite and was impressed but really, I only tasted it for the sake of tasting because I refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.

Let me preface this by saying I enjoy my hamburgers.  I usually have one or two a week and can reflect on one summer where my two best friends and I did nothing but taste-test burgers one summer in the city and finally rated the top two that made our list.  Those were the days.
Nowadays, as my tastes have refined and I've noticed that I prefer that the burger is a finer grind than a coarse grind or the bun makes or breaks. High maintenance, I know.

Hostein's takes burgers to a whole new level with their creative take on the standard Americana fare.  The last time I was here, I was torn between trying the Gold Standard (dry aged beef sirloin burger w\/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli ) but ended up trying the El Caliente (beef patty topped w\/ pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, pork chicharrones, & tequila-cilantro mayo) which was good with the varying textures but not spicy enough for me.  On another visit, tried their Steakhouse Burger ( beef patty crusted w\/black pepper, mixed greens, holsteins creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, swiss cheese ) which I found very good, with the tomato confit and marmalade onions giving the savory patty just enough of a tang to balance out the overall taste.

We also ordered a few side dishes: Caesar Salad, Lobster Mac n' Cheese, and the Poutine.  My Caesar salad was very tasty but we would recommend passing on the Mac n' Cheese as it lacked flavor from the lobster.  However, the cheesiness of the dish was perfect. The french fries here are pretty damn good but the short ribs were a little dry.  The cheese and gravy made the french fry dish a notch better but overall, an ok dish.  

Their bamboozled shakes were amazing.  Try their Grasshopper milkshake, the perfect blend between creamy mint and sweet chocolate bits perfectly ground and the liquor was just enough to make one aware,  but not throw off.

My burger was fine, but it certainly wasn't anything that went above and beyond A-OK. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

The highlight of my visit to Holstein's was without a doubt the service and atmosphere, which complimented the obviously excellent location. I rolled in on the later side of a Thursday evening and walked by several times over the course of the weekend: while crowded, there was rarely a wait, which was refreshing. From there my bartender doubling as my server was excellent, and I left feeling good about the experience even though the food didn't blow me away. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

While my $15 threshold for a sit-down burger of any kind is often a pretty hard ceiling, I'm going to have to relent when it comes to Vegas prices on the strip. My Steakhouse Burger and side of fries came to $18.00, and while that would normally be enough for me to take a good critical look at this star, I have no choice but to chalk that cost up to the Vegas premium. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Honestly my Steakhouse Burger was just okay, which was a bit of a letdown given the impressive laundry list of ingredients and peripherals. The black pepper crusted patty had some very good flavor, but it was simply too small given the size and quantity of other toppings and the lofty bun. The mixed greens went well with the proprietary steak sauce, but the marmalade onions were overpowering to the point where I didn't really even realize that the wild mushrooms and swiss cheese were in the mix. 

Probably the low point of the meal was the french fries, which, soft, limp and tasting as though they came out of a frozen bag, didn't add anything to the equation. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Holstein's is probably worth a visit, but I can't recommend it over some of the other options in town. No Star Granted.",4,1,2

From the menu description, the Fun-ghi burger contains: Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, & Frisee.  We also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.  The burger was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  The buffalo wings were very good too.  The fries were standard.  I so want to come back and try the Billionaire Burger and a shake!  The Billionaire Burger has kobe beef and foie gras, which we can't have anymore in CA.

Final verdict: Holstein's is pretty good and I enjoyed it.

Service was excellent.  Our waiter, [name removed for legal reasons], was always on top of checking up on us and making sure we were enjoying our food.

Food breakdown:

-Popcorn: I didn't know you got this automatically, or I would have mentally prepared myself.  It's ok.  It's popcorn...you gotta do reeaaallly well to impress me with popcorn.

-Onion rings: Good, but a mixed bag.  The first one I had was the prefect onion ring: perfect breading, a clean bite (no strings following you out), and perfectly crispy.  And while two of those never changed, I kept getting strings after that.  Not a deal killer, but definitely not ""perfect"" throughout the meal.

-Fun-Ghi Burger: Do you get it? Fun-ghi?  I...I actually don't get it.  You should probably just call it the Fungi Burger...save everyone the trouble.  That being said this was honestly, without a doubt, the BEST use of mushrooms on a burger I have ever had.  It had a delicious earthiness to it.  Not my favorite burger of all time, but definitely my favorite mushroom-based burger.  That might sound like a small field...but it is.

-Nom Nom Burger: It must be for the Kobe beef, but I find it funny that a burger with truffle mayo is cheaper than one with potato chips.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away.

-Fries: You get a lot of fries.

Now I know everyone is waiting for me to get to the shakes...and by everyone I mean you, Dale...but we didn't get one.

First off, the regular, non-alcoholic shakes were basic and didn't seem worth the time.  Second, I looked over the menu for the alcoholic shakes and every time I read the ingredient list all I could think about was the taste of straight alcohol and I lost my appetite for a shake.  Is that my fault?  Sure.  Should I have even mentioned all this?  Who's to say?  You?  I don't think so.  You don't own me.

Will I be back?  Perhaps.  I enjoyed it, though I wouldn't wait in a long line for it.  They just opened one nearby my house, though that one is just getting slammed for poor service so I don't know.

Also, whoever did the art for the walls either worked for Disney or learned a bit from their style.  I saw the 3-oval trick for the eyes, which works so well it's insane.",0,2,0

WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT DID I ORDER? IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE WAITRESS COULDN'T HEAR ME OVER THE LOUD MUSIC!

Seriously. Had a reservation, got seated, and quite literally the waitress had a hard time taking our party of four orders BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Worse we couldn't understand a thing she said\/asked either BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Each of our four orders  went something like this.

Customer, ""I'll have the _____ burger."" 
Waitress, ""Which one?""
Customer, ""The _____ burger.""
Waitress, now pointing to the menu, ""Which one?""
Customer now also points to the burger on the menu.
Waitress, ""The _____ burger? How would you like that cooked?""
Customer, ""What?""
Waitress, now shouting very slowly, ""HOW ... WOULD ... YOU ... LIKE ... THAT ... COOKED?""
Customer, now also shouting very slowly, ""MEE ... DEE ... UMM ... RARE!""
Waitress, ""WHAT KIND OF FRIES WOULD YOU LIKE?!""
Customer, ""WHAT?!""
Waitress, sighs. 
Customer, sighs.

As noted in other reviews the food is prepared well and is quite tasty but not sizeable. Burgers are about the size of a regular fast food burger. You get choice of fries, either steak or shoestring. Again, the amount is the size of a standard fast food fry. The shakes are also good but, again, not sizeable. On average 1 burger & fry + 1 shake = $30 with tax and tip.

So using the taste vs. cost vs. size vs. uncomfortable ambiance equation we arrive at a mere 1 star.

WHAT? 
I SAID ONE STAR! 
WHAT?!

I have had the onion rings tho, and they are great.

A couple nights later, I drunkenly stopped by to pick up a milkshake to go.  I got the Drunken Monkey and it was soooooooooo good.

After agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  We sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.

A few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake, it was actually a vanilla shake.

I don't really understand how this place is supposed to have the best burgers in all of Vegas. Vegas must really lack good burgers.

The ambiance is kind of weird - resembling a lounge\/club in the front bar area and almost like an Applebee's in the back dining room. Well, an Applebee's with Japanese style cartoon cows on the walls. 

Burgers here are really just mediocre at best. My veggie burger was mushy and didn't taste of the ""12 veggies"" the server proclaimed went into the patty at all! I have had a handful of great veggie burgers elsewhere, sometimes at a fraction of the price. Their veggie patty really tasted no different from a Garden burger (you know, the frozen kind). 

Okay, I'm sure you're laughing now about how I'm whining about the quality of a burger joint when I had the nerve to order a freaking veggie burger. Well, the oh-so popular ""rising sun"" burger the bf ordered wasn't too impressive either. Not only was the patty cooked to an almost well done when he specifically asked for medium rare, but the plethora of sweet Japanese BBQ sauce and various toppings totally overwhelmed the meat and was excessively salty, even for him! The one thing I did really enjoy was the sweet potato fries I ordered with my veggie burger, but I have rarely met a sweet potato fry that I didn't like.

We were pretty hungry so once we were seated we ordered both onion rings and fried pickles.  I've never had fried pickles and while they were tasty, I don't think its something I would order again.  I liked the crunchy onion rings...just lamented that there were so many!  The food runner who brought them out proudly announced that he tried to stack them as high as they could.  Really though?  It was LOT and there were only 3 of us!  

I had to decide whether I wanted to drink my calories or eat them, and I decided in favor of chewing versus sipping.  I passed on the adult milkshakes, though many of them looked tempting.  I ordered the fun-ghi burger which was really delicious.  Piping hot burger, with yummy mushrooms and cheese.  It was a great combination.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their burgers as well.

We tried the Classic, the typical cheese burger with beef patty, tomato, lettuce, and ketchup; and the Caliente, hamburger with jalapenos, avocado, jack cheese, and some cilantro mayo. The classic was so bitter because of the chard on the patty. We did not finish that burger. The Caliente's patty was slightly better, but patty was still really overcooked.

You know how joints brag about ""brioche buns"" and they were made a week ago and came from another state in a plastic bag? NOT HERE! A PROPER brioche bun that tastes and feels like it was baked a few hours and a few yards away. Juicy fresh ground meat, melty cheese, good smoked bacon, served HOT! Mine came with arugula and garlic aioli so I didn't add a thing. Fries were very good, and real potatoes. My wife had a delicious and LARGE chocolate malt. Her burger came with onion rings that were wonderful. I'd come back for just those and a shake! When I think of Bobby's Burger Joint, that's Ratdonald's next to this place!",1,1,0

They said they'd text us, so we went down to the casino and did some gambling. 45 minutes later, I received no text, so we went back upstairs and checked in. We were seated after a brief pause, which made me wonder how long I'd be waiting for a text if I didn't go up and check back in.

We ordered the onion rings and two of their boozy milkshakes. A coworker recommended I try the onion rings, and they were fantastic. The order came out quick, as did the milkshakes. The milkshakes were awesome, barely a booze taste and worth the price.

Our entrees on the other hand took quite a while to arrive. I would guess nearly 30 minutes. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, but for a burger place on a Saturday night I had a hard time believing they weren't prepared for the evening rush.

I had the pork belly sliders which were excellent. If you've had pork buns at a Chinese restaurant, they were like that, including the soft bun and the sauce, but crispier and better. They serve 3 to a plate, which was enough for me but I was already getting full from the milkshake and the onion rings.

My wife had the Classic burger and said it was alright, but nothing extra ordinary. Considering it took 30+ minutes to come out, she said it was about as good as she's had at Red Robin. I had a bite and it was fine, but again I don't think it was anything amazing. It was a decent burger, properly cooked to a medium rare, not exceptionally huge or covered in exotic toppings, and considering the prices in Vegas, it was worth the $14.

Best part of the meal was the milkshakes and the onion rings. A word of caution about the milkshakes - they  fill you up! If you finish one it's like eating a huge ice cream sundae with booze on it. They are definitely worth the price.

If I'm gambling at or near the Cosmopolitan I'd give the place another try, maybe for lunch. The food was good and the price was right.",1,0,0

The decor was cute, lots of pigs and cows. They had this cute whimsical looking pig on an 18""x18"" glass connected to eachother as wall seperators.

Lobster Rolls-served on mini hot dog style buns, filled with a lobster filling-it was okay but couldnt taste the lobster, you got 2 mini's for $14, Lobster Mac-n-Cheese was incredible & I would order a full size order for myself!

Their menu is perfect for that since they have Nosh (apps) and Tiny Buns (sliders) on the menu in addition to full size dishes.

They start you off with a little bucket of popcorn and seems the flavor changes - the first time we had the Cajun...yum.  We had the Holsteins sliders which showed that this place makes some legit burgers, even in mini-size. The Ahi Poke Tostadas were tasty little bites of goodness - I could've eaten 2 orders had we not been trying to save ourselves for dinner! We also shared the Crispy Pork Belly Buns...I came back for more of these soft, Bao-like ""tacos"". The pork belly has a gorgeous crisp on the outside with a tender inside and is a perfect fit for the soft, fluffy bun. On the second visit, I ordered more of these along with their Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese. It was creamy with big chunks of lobster. The chip and lobster garnish was so good, it could be it's own dish. Maybe it's the lobster salad from the Lobster Rolls? And, since it was late morning, I tried the Spicy Bloody Mary which is made with a jalapeño cilantro infused vodka. Bold flavor with a lingering heat. The hubby got a Strawberry Shake that he thoroughly enjoyed.

We were sat quickly both visits. The second visit was Sunday morning during football so we opted to skip the $40 hourly charge for their bar tables...but there was a table in the back that had 2 TVs just no sound. 

Service was good both visits. Food came out quick and hot.

Art on the walls is by Juan Muniz, and I was impressed. Street art style, looked like it was commissioned for the restaurant specifically. Very cool!

I really can't tell you much about the fries. I think I liked them, but I was so into my burger that I couldn't tell you much about them. I actually ordered a Martini to go with this steak burger and it couldn't have been more fitting.

The sweet potato fries are way worth the $1 upgrade. They were perfection on my tongue. Nice and crispy and chewy.

We also split the autumn house salad... it was SO good. Lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.

We split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. Wanted to try others but we were way too full.

First off, the beer selection is well organized with several verities that anyone, aficionados to the everyday beer fan can enjoy.  Lets not even get into what happens with the shakes!!! The menu has a fun selection of ""bar bites"", sliders and burgers.  I enjoyed a combo of truffles lobster Mac and cheese, buffalo dipping sauce and a chunky monkey milk shake with a gulden draak ale as a finisher!  Obviously I'm off my diet but the 5 years of recovery will be well worth it!  I must say the service was phenomenal!  Lara, the epitome of what a skilled server should be, was attentive, on task, quickly responsive and though busy never missed a moment to check in, smile and make sure my meal was enjoyable!  Never waited more than a couple of minutes between the order and its tabling (drinks) and the food was promptly delivered about 5-10 minutes from time of ordering.  This even while the restaurant was packed and I observed every table top full!  Well done!  

In summary, I'm sure just from my limited experience the rest of the menu is going to be delicious.

Based on the pictures I'd seen, I knew I had to make my way to this establishment. This restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel mall area. It also afforded me the chance to check it out, and I was impressed. The ambiance and atmosphere of both the restaurant and hotel are hip, modern, trendy, and fun.

To my relief (and something I've noticed is not somewhat uncommon in Vegas thankfully), there was no wait upon entering at around 4.30 (albeit it was a week night). The service started a little slow but improved throughout the meal. It didn't take too long to receive our meals, which also pleased me.

I ordered the salad and added grilled chicken to it. Was it ordinary? Yes. There was nothing remarkable about it, nor did it have any ingredients I didn't have at home. But it suited me for my health-conscious habits, whereas other places may not offer something so simple. Additionally, the grilled chicken tasted decent enough.

My friend really enjoyed the burger, and I admit it did look to be of good quality.

Another nice touch is the popcorn provided once you are seated-always nice to have a nibble food while you wait for your meal.

Check out my pics of the bathroom-very trendy indeed. There is only one stall (which while nice and private, I imagine runs into a problem if the restaurant is rather crowded).

Three stars because while the atmosphere was great, this didn't offer stand-out food. It hit the spot for what it was worth, and I'm glad I tried it.

Having to contend with their awful parking lot is not what I look forward to, as great a hotel as it is.  Otherwise, Holsteins is another addition to their great restaurant line up (Jaleos, Comme Ca, E, all very tasty).

We ended up taking our friend from Australia here since he was craving an american hotdog or burger and a shake.  Having been bummed with our last burGR place, we decided to try out Holsteins based on its yelp reviews.

Not disappointed!  I'm a sucker for a good vanilla shake...and Holstein's version definitely is near the top of the list.  Flavorful vanilla ice cream mixed in with delicious whole milk, doesn't get more basic than that - but oh so tasty.

Food wise, everything was in order, though my burger cooked rare made  entree time a bit underwhelming.  Started with ahi tuna poke, which came with a delicious bed of seaweed salad.  Tuna was cut into small chunks for easy transport with the salad into your mouth - very thoughtful of the chefs.  I had the gold standard burger which comes with aged goat cheddar and smoked bacon.  Bacon was a little on the jerky side, good flavor though.  I did find the goat cheese a bit overpowering on the palette, kind if drowns out the bacon and the meat.  I've had worse burgers.  Maybe the green chile burger next time...

We had all three sides - rings, regular fries, and sweet potatoe fries.  The  rings, man, delicious.  I don't like my rings falling apart so a little longer in the fryer is just fine for me.  The batter was crispy and thick enough to hold it all together.  Chipotle dip was excellent as well - creamy with a little bite at the end.  Perfect with both fries and rings.

Hen House Burger is phenomenal. Simple concept of adding an egg to a burger, we've seen it before but Holstein's does it right. Expect to make a mess with this one.

I love the Cosmopolitan and would already stay here because of the beautiful rooms but the fact that the Rising Sun burger is served downstairs gives me more of a reason to return to this hotel when I visit Vegas.  When it comes to ""fancy"" burgers, I normally prefer a good ol' backyard bbq style burger or InNOut over the Umami style fancy pants type burgers.  However the Rising Sun might just give that backyard style burger a run for its money.  Take away all the clubs, the glitz & glamour and unique entertainment on the Strip and I'd still return to Vegas just to eat this burger again.  Holstein's fries and other burgers are mediocre\/ok (with the exception of the Korean style one which was good too) so I would only come here for the shakes and Rising Sun.

I make it a point to eat here every time I'm in town.  Great place to stop by before clubbing at Marquee, which is right in front of Holstein's.  There's usually about a 15 minute wait for a table but you can also grab a table in the bar area which is first-come first serve.

Oh and another plus- Rising Sun doesn't have any onions in it so if you are planning on clubbing and working your game on some hottie in the club later in the night, you won't have to worry about having stinky onion breath. ;)",1,1,0

We added sprouts to our burger, which was excellent, I recommend you add those if you're a fan of sprouts. The burger overall was great and the fries that came with it we're totally up-to-par on the fries scale.

Drunkin monkey was AMAZING! An extra shot in it is $3. I didn't get it but my friend did and it was delicious. They too the shake off with a piece of banana dipped in chocolate and a good sized chunk of chocolate on top. Vanilla shake gets white chocolate on top. 

FOOD: 
Late Night menu is basically snacks but they also offer two of the burgers which are not listed. Regular cheese burger and a bacon cheeseburger. The cheeseburger was good. Meat was cooked well to my liking and it was pretty big. I couldn't finish it. Also tried their ""Poutine"" it's French fries topped with shredded beef, cheese, and gravy on the side! Very good but you have to dig around for the cheese. Still amazing though

The highest quality ingredients, matched together impeccably, and served in a gorgeous restaurant at a luxe spot on the Las Vegas strip with art by a fantastic local artist. Perfection!

I got the Gold Standard - to think of what I experienced with each bite brings tears to my eyes, it was beautiful! I also experienced the fried pickles (a MUST have), country fried bacon and the pork buns. Bring friends, split the appetizers and spring for the burger. You won't regret it. 

Finish things off with one of their amazing shakes - I had the Tira Misu, and I will absolutely be back for another. 

The staff are uber friendly and definitely knowledgeable. The prices aren't In N Out Burger, but they aren't Strip Steak, either. Right in the middle where they should be. The Gold Standard burger was $17.95 and worth double that.

Heard a lot about their milkshakes, ordered a black and white.  Just like everyone says, it's a good milkshake.  So it's definitely worth coming here just for that.

Black truffle lobster mac 'n cheese: black truffle was too strong.  If the lobster didn't have a distinct color, you wouldn't have even noticed it was in there.  Sauce was underseasoned.  The chip garnish was interesting, but I don't see how that plays in with the dish.  Superfluous...but not a negative.

Korean kimchi hot dogs: was very intrigued by this menu item, but it was underwhelming.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog with bbq sauce.  Didn't get the sour punch from the kimchi, nor did I even notice pork belly in it.  The bun was very soft and delicious though.  

Gold standard burger: goat cheese cheddar was wonderful, and my burger was cooked to medium rare which is a plus.  Overall, burger was good, but lacked seasoning.  Bun was nicely done.  

Service was spot-on.  We sat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait for a table, so I can't say much for the actual dining service.  

For what it is, and being in Vegas, I'd say it's a good spot to go for a burger fix.  Is it a top tier burger place?  Remains to be seen when I come back again, because there's a lot of stiff competition out there.",0,0,0

We came here on the Sunday of Halloween weekend & were glad that the wait wasn't that long. Our waitress kindly informed us about their ""special"" shakes (which i thought was unique to their establishment). I ordered the Gold Standard, which our waitress said they were most famous for. The burger LOOKED really good, but as I bit into the burger, I quickly realized that the patty was very bland. They had cooked it the way I wanted, but there was just no flavor whatsoever in the patty. My appetite disappeared soon after as I found it hard to even eat the french fries. Our waitress seemed to have disappeared for a while as well. 

Perhaps my taste buds were off that day from all the drinking the two nights before, but my meal just wasn't appetizing to me. Based on my first try here at Holsteins, I don't believe that they deserve the 4 stars. I am, however willing to give them another try & order something that would better appeal to my taste.

It had great texture, but I was looking for a slightly saltier finish.  The herb-caper mayo was really good though.  The chocolate shake, although a bit expensive, was good.  The Valrhona pearls were a nice textural touch.  And now to the gold standard burger.  I loved the texture of the bun and my burger was cooked perfectly.

The milkshakes are unreal. They offer some off-the-menu milkshakes as well which you should surely ask your server about. The night we went they were offering a cake doughnut milkshake that sounded like as good of a poor decision as any in Vegas, nahdamean?

I understand that Cosmopolitan has the worst problem anywhere on the strip with escorts, but I don't think us girls look remotely like escorts, but the Holstein hostesses sure treated us like we were unwelcome guests of theirs.  A couple girls came late to dinner and filtered in, and each time the hostesses at the front door INSISTED that there was no party of ours in the back of the place despite us texting our girlfriends that we were inside.  This happened three times that the hostesses would not even let the girls walk to the back to find us.  Seriously the hostess would not let the girl walk in to Holsteins to find our party.  I couldn't believe it.  Most places in Las Vegas LOVE having pretty girls around and usually will even pay to have pretty girls in places or pay for their dinners.  The hostesses here acted like we were hookers or something instead.  When we complained to our server each time this happened she didn't know what to do or how to handle the situation.

I knew I wanted to try a 'crazy' shake when I saw the online menu before we go to this place, but they didn't seem to have as many shakes as I saw online or my failed memory from constant drinking and partying the many nights before was kicking in or I was just starting to feel 26. Who knows?

We opted to sit in the lounge area (only 2 of us since the rest of our party decided to fly out of Vegas early, good if you don't want to gamble all your winnings away last minute) and we were greeted by our waitress.

I ordered from the Tiny Buns (also known as sliders) and got the Crispy Pork Sliders! I was also suffering from what we believed to be a food allergy to something from the night before, so we informed our waitress that I have a seafood allergy and she went ahead and informed the kitchen of this so they would take extra care as to not contaminate ANYTHING with seafood. Man do I miss seafood... +50 stars for this alone.

The pork sliders were small, but filling...may be small for other people though! They pan fried them for me to be extra safe.

My dining partner, Jeff L., ordered some fat ass burger called The Rising Sun. I didn't get to taste it, but it looked REALLY good. Also, it comes with fries, but not enough fries where it you could split it amongst people.

I didn't want to overeat, even though we were in Sin City, so I just got a shake as oppose to the pretty awesome sounding appetizers. We shared the Cereal Bowl shake which basically had Captain Crunch in it. It won't cut the roof of your mouth!

FORGET GOING TO SERENDIPITY 3 for the frozen hot chocolate when you can have Holstein's milkshakes with ALCOHOL in it!!!

The server was friendly and helpful. Ordered the Oreo shake - a MUST try. So, so good I nearly drank the whole thing before my meal came. 
For my meal I ordered the Hen House burger add cheese....cooked medium. My brother ordered the Carbonara Chicken sandwhich. 
It was busy so it took about 15 min for our orders to come out after drinks were served. No biggie, to be expected. First thing I noticed was that they forgot the cheese on my burger. Again, no huge deal. Took a while for the waiter to come back around but got me some cheese on a plate. 
Next, I cut into the burger. As I ordered it to be cooked medium I expected cooked with a little bit of pink. Unfortunately, it was cooked near rare. I ate two bites luckily from the outside (more cooked) part of the burger before noticing. By this time it was getting close to having to leave for the concert. Server was great and offered to have it re-cooked. As we needed to leave quickly he offered to have it placed in a to-go box but sadly we could not bring food into the concert. 

This resulted in the burger being taken off the bill and the friendly manager offering us some cool nitrogen? type desert bites.

I repeated some favorites from my first visit - the spicy bloody mary, the fried pickles, The Rising Sun, and the Frozen Grasshopper - and all were as remembered.  In fact I'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.

We came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  We put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  I guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.

Service was good, polite and moderately quick.  A few of my friends and I use FourSquare (sorry, Yelp), and we each got a complimentary Holstein's Spacial (not a typo on my end) Lager.  It was tasty, refreshing, and free, and I'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  We did leave a nice tip.

I did try a couple new things this time around, and I'll just note those here.  The Fun-Ghi (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  The mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  All the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  For dessert, we supplemented our Frozen Grasshopper with a Campfire Smores shake - Smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  I mean please I will never stock Smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  The shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.

My girls got my dinner, for which I am very grateful.  Holstein's was fun and full of tasty things, a great start to an epic bachelorette weekend.",5,4,3

The Steakhouse Burger is a dang good burger.  The cut of meat is exceptional and the peppercorns really add a nice pop to the flavor.  If you like high quality burgers where the meat is the prominent element, this is the burger for you.  

Maybe I should go with a 5star because the cut of meat really was that good, but I just had BurGR's UK Burger last night (formerly known as the Britannia Burger) and its dominance as the best burger I have ever had might be setting the bar too high and making me too critical.

The pizza flavored popcorn and the fries are top notch sidekicks to go with the burger.  I considered a shake, but nothing inspired me on the menu (could have been lack of pictures or descriptions, I dunno)...Maybe another time.

I was shocked and explained I was just ordering a beer from the bar, (you know, like people do at a bar) before she went on about that table being upset and they needed me to move.

I was flabbergasted. I told her that this was incredibly rude, that I had only been standing there long enough to order the beer, but since my business was apparently unwanted, that I would not be eating there at all now. I looked over at the table in question, which was had incredibly snobby looking patrons sitting, who would not even look at me.

I went to the front of house, talked to the manager. I found he was the one who sent that server over to ask me to move! He did say he sent her over to talk to me, but apologized about the way it was handled. He seemed sincere, but I dont know how you can ask staff to do something like that.

My friend and I ended up eating here because we came to Cosmopolitan to eat at Comme Ca, unfortunately SEMA was in town and Comme Ca was hosting an event in their dining room. Being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at Comme Ca, we walked over to Holsteins. We had to wait for a seat here too so I was really freakin hungry when we sat down. 

One bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*

Other than that our server was very nice and helpful. He knew the menu well. BUT. My friend and I knew we were getting the Billionaire Burger because we HAD to have a burger with foie gras in it. Yep. This burger comes with a big chunk of grilled foie gras right in the burger. It has Kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. DANG. If you don't feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. I also added some cheese to mine. 

We also split the ""Snickers, Please!"" dessert, which was decent, but I would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it WITH your burger instead.

Service:
excellent.  our waiter was always around while we were looking through the menu to give us suggestions and answer any questions and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  drinks were always full and extra sauce was brought out fast

Atmosphere:
a little casual and kicked back feeling, but still a little more fancy than most casual places just due to how it felt in the restaurant probably because of the lighting and the layout

Food:  (the most important part, right?)
I will start out by saying that if you have ever been to Unami, it is very much like that, but i felt it was even better.  I got the gold standard burger, and it was very good.  the patty had that great fluffy texture and not super packed like at most burger places which made it extra juicy.  the tomato mix they put on it made it very much like bruschetta and was a nice change from just a plain old tomato.  the arugula on it added a nice bitter taste to contrast with the tomato and meat, along  with the bite from the goat cheese cheddar that they put on.  just to throw it out there, the goat cheese threw me for a loop because i am used to goat cheese being very soft like it usually is, but the goat cheese cheddar on the burger was a pretty hard texture, almost like a parmesan but it still had that amazing goat cheese taste.  the bun was to me a standard type bun that you would expect at a gourmet burger place, but it was toasted just right and soaked up the juice from the burger patty very well.  I also got an order of the shoestring fries which were seasoned perfectly that i didn't even bother asking for anything to do them in (i usually dip my fries in blue cheese dressing).  the fries were very crispy since they were pretty thin, but salted perfectly and there was a decent sized portion of them also.

the only thing that wasn't super awesome to me was the prices (i believe the gold standard was around $17) but for typical vegas prices, it isn't too bad.  and considering it was bigger and better than unami for around the same price, it isn't that big of a deal.

My family and I got there at around 11:45 am. Not exactly lunch time yet so it was pretty spacious and not packed. HOlsteins has complimentary popcorn but our server was a bit tardy compared to other servers & their tables. So at first, we saw popcorn on nearly every other table and were wondering what's so special about the popcorn that got so many people to order it as their appetizer? Then we realized it's complimentary when our server brought it out pretty late. Not a huge complaint but just saying.

I got the steakhouse burger and I was pretty satisfied. The burgers are said to be 6 oz, which I find is just right. There are some people on this yelp page who say the size isn't that great and it was not big. But I mean what more do you want? it's 6 oz. I mean yeah sure 8 oz burger is bigger but for a burger, 6 oz was just right. After consuming a 6 oz burger, you don't feel disgustingly full. It's not too much beef and not too much unhealthy food. 6 oz is just right. Any more is just not necessary. Sweet potato fries were good. The steakhouse burger is pepper-crusted and comes with a tomato confit. Excellent burger. I loved it but I wouldn't recommend it. Let me clarify. I do not regret getting it. I do not think it was a bad burger. But it wouldn't be one I would recommend to others. I didn't personally feel it was indicative of Holsteins' caliber. So although I enjoyed it and it tasted great, I just wouldn't get it again. 

My sister got the rising sun burger and I thought the tempura avocado and the teriyaki glaze was fantastic. They really made the entire thing a masterpiece. The tempura avocado was unique and just burst on your taste buds. Teriyaki glaze gave it a nice taste. The burgers we ordered were all juicy, not dry. We had high praise for Holsteins. 

Holsteins has a lot more on its menu than BurGR. I love Gordon Ramsay but his menu pales in comparison to here. Also, my god, the shake was fantastic. We got the turtle pecan cheesecake or whatever it was. It was absolutely magnificent. Not overly sweet. It just really was an explosion of several layers of flavor that fit together really well. I definitely recommend this shake. Just absolutely tasty and I want another shake from Holsteins. We looked around and a myriad of other tables ordered shakes too. They're a very great aspect of the restaurant. So, get a shake along with a burger! 

Service was okay. Not too impressive. Not friendly enough. The place is pricy. I don't deny that but hey it's Vegas. Did you expect to get cheap burgers? Tbh, I'm pretty content with paying the price for my steakhouse burger though. It's a bit pricy but they deliver on flavor. 

I'll definitely be back, Holsteins!",0,0,0

I also tried one of the mini-burgers but it was small and maybe difficult to make a patty that size very juicy, so I would go with the full sized burger next time. Most of the food on the menu was burgers and fries so go if that is what you are in the mood for and you want a lot of options in that category.

There is ABX American Burger in Excalibur, BLT Burger in Mirage and Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood just to name a few. This time we decided to try Holsteins for their adult milkshakes. Also my husband had been here before so of course I had to try it after all his rants and raving.

We came in for dinner on a Friday evening around 5:30pm. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. After taking some time to decide I went with the Rising Sun Burger and Oreo Shake. The burger was one of the best I've had of it's kind. It wasn't as big as burger from Red Robin but remember its quality over quantity. The patty was fresh and juicy, cooked medium as requested. The Rising Son had Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, and Tempura Avocado  The fries were crisp, golden, hand cut thick fries. I liked that they stayed crispy and weren't oily.

The Oreo shake tasted good but didn't seem to stand out from anything else I had before. I didn't even feel any of the alcohol. Maybe it was because I was full from eating or needed a double shot since the alcohol was Bailey's Irish Cream.

The restaurant was clean and service outstanding. Burgers are a little pricey but your getting a way better quality burger than Red Robin and hey it's Vegas! If anything stop in and have a shake. The shake menu is pretty extensive and I haven't heard anything bad about any of them myself. The other two shakes ordered at our table that night were the Creme Brulee and Black Cow. My husband says S'mores is still his favorite.   Whether or not I'm staying the Cosmopolitan the next time I visit I'd eat here again.",5,3,3

Service\/ambiance: I came for a late lunch on a Saturday and there was no wait. Probably because of the odd hour dining. But the service here was great. Anytime we needed something we were helped and the waiters were all so friendly. As for the atmosphere it was very relaxing and just a great hang out place for my friends and I to come and enjoy our food and each other's company.

Food:
-Check in for your free beer! The beer (I forgot the name...sorry!) was just any draft beer. I shared with everyone so we could all try. Nothing strong so it's a good beer everyone could enjoy.

-Nom Nom Burger: This was recommended to me by our waitress. I like! It has some extra crispy chips inside (which surprisingly stayed in my burger the whole time, I tend to struggle). I really liked the chips inside. It gave the burger a nice little pizazz. The burger itself wasn't exactly super juicy, just your average burger. Very flavorful though! I just like it more on the juicier side, which I guess wouldn't work out too well with the chips. Either way, I'd definitely get this again if I were to come back

-Milkshakes (in general): I tried several and all of them were good. We ordered the ones with alcohol which I couldn't taste so that's good. They weren't shakes I would get to try to get a buzz so I'm not sure the additional alcohol is even worth it. But they did taste good!

Partially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).

2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.

So yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.

Sweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.

The BF and I split the fun-ghi burger, which was really good. I also had a bite of the Rising Sun which was great as well (think burger with an Asian twist). Their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Since we were sharing the burger, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. I wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.

We ordered a couple of milkshakes: Brown Cow Float, Oreo, Drunken Monkey, and Campfire Smores. My favorite was the Oreo. The Brown Cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. It's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal.

Underneath one main goal of my Vegas trip (eat well), I had a sub-goal: eat a burger. A while back, I had seen some show on some basic-cable channel and it showed that Vegas has a gazillion burger options, all apparently awesome. Holstein's had stuck in my brain, and so it was on my list. 

Lo and behold, I'm headed to Vegas, and Holstein's is in my hotel! After encouraging my friends to check it out (didn't take much encouragement though, honestly), we made reservations for dinner. And, it was an all-around hit!

I had a Campfire Smores Bam-Boozled shake, with a Nom Nom burger & fries.

Shake was GREAT! Really, not that boozy. But I loved the chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker combo.

And the Nom Nom burger was awesome. I am not a fan of the whole ""nom nom nom"" thing, but LOVED the burger despite the name. Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, chips, and 1000 island. Great combo!! Burger was cooked to my order, and the bun stood up to the burger well, without getting soggy. All my friends loved *their* burgers too.

Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a while. It was one of those kind of messy but sooo tasty burgers that you just can't NOT eat in one sitting. 

We came in early for lunch on a Sunday before leaving Vegas and it was basically empty. We were sat immediately and within minutes I had eyed one of their seasonal milkshakes (with some booze of course!) a Pumpkin Pie milkshake. Literally SO Good. It had pumpkin pie vodka in it with with pumpkin pie filling, pepitas, and graham cracker crumble. I was literally drinking a pumpkin pie spiked with vodka and it was heaven! Ordered the the ""Fun Ghi"" burger to eat because I'm a big fan of mushrooms and truffle mayo and it was delicious! The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the gruyere cheese complimented the burger really well. The fries it came with were seasoned and crispy as well! 

There are a ton of burger joints in Vegas and they are all over priced but I'd rate Holsteins up there as one of the best. I love the cute decor and the trendy atmosphere with its location right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan.",1,1,1

First off even if I had not gotten sick...

The place is over priced, the keep the dining room too cold, and the frys suck. The only good thing about the place is the location. And it does not live up to he hype.

The have warnings and  a * by every burger to tell you that you can get sick from undercooked food. This would not be necessary if their food was fresh. One warning is enough, but regardless you don't serve people bad food or old food that's going bad. You do not eat at your own risk! That's not how Restaurants work!

I first went to the place after hearing it was good and saw it on Groupon and bought 3 groupons. I went with a friend. Had a burger and fries and was not impressed there are much better burgers in this city like Bachi Burger, Smash Burger, Cheese Cake Factory, Etc...

The other 2 Groupons expired, that's how little I thought of the place! I went  one other time for someone's birthday and I did not have much of a choice. The food was still average as best.

The last time I went I only  went because I had Groupon credits. I ordered a Lamb Burger and the waiter said it tasted like a Gyro. The place was so cold I could hardly eat. The lady in the booth next to me over heard me complaining about how cold it was and she said ""You're not crazy, it too cold in here and my husband sent is fries back because they were cold.""

The Lamb burger was over spiced to hide the flavor of the obviously old lamb that was going bad. (Note: I'll never order a Lamb Burger anywhere again as Lamb does not sell as fast and they probably kept it too long.)

The Taziki sauce on the burger was horrible and the worst Taziki I have ever had. The fries, I just don't like they are just not good, not crisp and I don't like what ever they dip them in.

First I will say that I eat Sushi, Medium Lamp Chops, Ahi Tuna Burgers med-rare and Burger Med all of the time and I've Never had a problem.

Also for those of you that don't know Taking 1 Tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of water can prevent many types of food borne illnesses as as well just normal digestive issues.

I did that after eating there as a precaution since their warnings all over the menu and their greasy fries.

I started feeling achy within an hour and got tired. When I got home took a nap. Woke up feeling nauseated. Took more Vinagar with a few drops of Lugol's Iodine this time. That will kill almost anything and will keep you safe  in 3rd world countries. Because of these steps I have not had food poisoning in many years.

Was not helping. I ended up vomiting for 45 minutes getting the runs, and knew it was time to get out the Activated Charcoal. In hindsight I would have gone with a large does of this first.

Even after all of these steps and a few more I took to kill off the pathogens in the food I ate there. I was sick in bed with fever for the next 2 days and my 3 day easter weekend was ruined. On the bright side do to knowing how to handle it I didn't die, didn't have kidney failure and I'm smarter than to ever eat at that place again!

Eat there at your own risk and if you do make sure it's WELL DONE!

A Few Tips to Prevent\/ Cure Food Poisoning that could save your life:
Because this was one of the most miserable experiences I have had from eating out... I want to share some tips that will prevent this for others.

Don't Order Foods that are not top sellers.

Drinking Hard Alcohol with food can also reduce the bacteria on food but it's not always the best choice. I personally don't like to drink. But if you have no other option A shot of Vodka could help.

Apple Cider Vinegar in water after eating can prevent many types of food poisoning if they are bacteria and not already forming toxins for those type even heat will not kill the toxins.

Lugol's Iodine added to the mixture makes it even more effective against bacteria and viruses.

Colloidal Silver taken after eating can also help to kill food borne bacteria.

But the #1 thing that will soak up the bacteria, the toxins they produce as well as actual poison and even heavy metals, stop the vomiting and runs to the bathroom is Activated Charcoal and a fairly large does of it like 1-2 table spoons in a big glass of water. 

Google it and do your research and keep some with you when you travel and in your home.

My mistake was not taking the Activated Charcoal sooner and a large enough does... Oh wait my first mistake was eating there.",3,1,2

I'm not a big burger person and only really have them on rare occasions ... this being one of them. The Gold Standard burger was AMAZEBALLS. Highly recommended. 

My two young sons don't like burgers by title. Since Holstein's has sliders, we conspired with our server to call them 'Crabby Patties' (the signature burger from Sponge Bob) and suddenly the boys LOVED them. It was comical. I wish I had a video camera. 

I was seriously craving a milkshake (it was a cheat-weekend), but the boys were becoming ... annoying. If it wasn't nap time for them, I'm sure that this paragraph would be raving about their shakes. Next time.

Good lookin' out!  I was leaving the Cosmopolitan after the Black Keys show, hungry and bitter that both Jaleo and China Poblano had stopped serving food.  Suddenly, a friend texted me from HSB saying they had vegan options!

I traversed the mob of drunken concert-goers and arrived poste haste, just in time to put in the last to-go order of the night!

The main vegan options are the Urth burger sliders (2 for $8, comes with delicious homemade-tasting potato chips) or the proper full-sized Urth burger ($13, comes with a side of fries).  I went for the sliders, since I  have not had a slider since I was knee-high to a grasshopper back in TN eating at Krystal's.  

Verdict - Fries were awesome, chips were awesome, Urth burger was so-so.  It was a mix of veggies, and maybe chickpea flour? It had a falafel-ish character to it.  It was nicely fried on the outside, but pretty mushy.  It came topped with avocado, cucumber and sprouts (see pic) on a fluffy bun that was not egg-washed.  It's nothing that I'd go running back for, but it's a solid option for late-night eating when your carnivore friends insist on burgers.",6,2,3

The burgers are made with the finest ingredients, are thick and juicy and are cooked to perfection. They're also a bit eclectic. While you can get a basic cheeseburger is you're a boring guy who has given up on life, I highly recommend that you try one of the more unique selections. My wife and I split a ""Rising Sun"" and a ""Gold Standard"" burger. Both were excellent. The onion rings were also amazing. They were giant and the breading was nothing short of spectacular. If you're looking for an adult (i.e. alcoholic) milkshake, try the ""Fat Boy,"" which contains pretzels, chocolate\/Carmel popcorn, Reese's, and vodka. It was'nt too strong, but it was DELICIOUS! 

The only downside is that this place is expensive, but when you're eating at good restaurants in Vegas, what place isn't expensive? I suppose the best way to spin it is that you get what you pay for.

Holsteins is definitely a popular game day spot. The bar had a really cool setup with lots of couches and tables in addition to the bar and plenty of TVs so that guests could enjoy all of the games. Even the staff was in the game day spirit and many sported jerseys for their favorite teams. As the Cowboys were not playing during that time, we had little interest in the football games, so we waited for a table in the main dining area.

After a short five minute wait, we were seated at a booth. Our waiter appeared just seconds later to take our drink orders and was then back to take our food orders just minutes after that. Unfortunately, that was the last we would see of him for a while. Another server delivered our food and then our server was gone for about 35-40 minutes. Not sure where he went. I wanted some ketchup but he wasn't around to ask and I had finished all of my fries by the time he reappeared. This unusual disappearance (during the lunch rush) is why I am not giving this place five stars.

On the plus side, the food and the milkshake were really outstanding. We ordered the A-chocolypse now shake which was boozy, rich, creamy, and very chocolatey. While the fudge brownie was amazing and the shake had just enough vodka for us to feel a buzz, the real MVP was the array of tiny, crunchy chocolate balls affixed to the rim of the glass with vanilla frosting. There was no way to eat the spheres without making a mess but they were so tasty that we kept eating them anyway.

To eat, we ordered the Gold Standard burger with fries. The dry-aged sirloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was nicely seasoned. The goat cheese and garlic chive aioli were both subtle and enhanced the taste of the burger without overpowering the beef. Overall, it was a very satisfying burger. The fries were fine although I wish I had ketchup to eat them with.

Servers were very friendly and service was good. I started out with a bloody marry which was ok. needed a little more hot sauce. I shared the ""Rising Sun"" with my girlfriend, meat was tender and juicy. It had a good flavor and the bun was tasty as well. I loved the avocado inside; gave it a nice smooth taste with it. 

The Thing that gave this place 4 stars is the peanut butter shake; I believe the Chocolate Monkey ( I might be wrong). It had chocolate and peanut butter with some baileys Irish cream. If you were to give this shake to a child they wouldn't taste the alcohol. lol. Its so smooth. Enjoyed this place very much.",1,0,0

My only complaint about the burger was it was a little too juicy...and the juices were starting to flow from the meat onto my plate & hands but better juicy than dry. Theres also a quick fix to this by simply eating the burger upside down because for some reason the top bun is usually a lot more sturdy and  can manage to keep itself together.

You can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the East side area. Once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says Wicked Spoon and Convention Center. When you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.

I checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. Quick & prompt just the way I like it ;) I sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. It was literally a money spot. Front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. I like this spot.. oh yes I do.

My server, Jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. Giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which I felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. A more personable approach I would say... I asked him if there was any way I could take my food to go, since I explained that I would like to share it with my Family and he was more than willing to oblige my request. 

He went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item I was interested in trying. I appreciate his honesty on how I should get my Salmon cooked and what I could possibly add if I would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the Turkey choice that I ordered. Jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. Kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & I gave him his well deserved tip. I think he even bowed & said thank you so much. Wait.. I think I bowed to him first?!?? Eh it's in my culture to bow when I appreciate & respect someone. Koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. Don't mind me.. I'm just being ME.

Tom Turkey Sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the Tiny Buns Section - When you first glance at these trios... Adorably cute. It consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & Russian dressing on the side. The dressing itself is between a hint of Horseradish & Thousand Island Dressing. It gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. The tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, But I ended up liking the chewy bites. I generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. I was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy. 

Crispy Pork Belly Bun - ( comes in 3's ) Think of Peking Duck Steamed Bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. I swear there was cilantro in the mix too. The hoisin sauce is more like a Chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. The steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. The pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. A combination that anybody would love.

Captain Hook - I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. I would say this is a good looking burger. Succulent and vibrant. Marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. Together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. This was definitely a Hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. I chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. Thin, crispy, and tasty! I have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. I'm Hook'ed!

My Family and I enjoyed all the burgers. The music at Holstein's is fresh. Even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped Both of my feet to the beats. Friendly staff and wonderful service. I would recommend Jonathan again to be my server. I did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. He was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. I even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. I did skip on the shakes this time, but the Oreo is my favorite! The artwork here is uniquely admirable. I like the way they hold this place down with colors that will tickle your sweet tooth. Great location for people watching and even mingling :P",17,9,14

I was salivating when I saw Billionaire burger ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but I decided that the Hen House burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its fried egg and bacon.  That is, until our server highly recommended the award winning Gold Standard burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  It was done--I would eat the winner.

Although complex and tasty, the Gold Standard didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  I didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  For a gourmet burger, Umami Burger (multiple locations in LA and one in SF) is my gold standard and it's about 2\/3 of the prices here.  I did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at Holsteins.

Guy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and\/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.

The burger - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since the burger was juicy i can live with it.

Onion rings were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.

Will i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.

A pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?

When we FIRST visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  And their burgers are very good. Very, very good.

But, we've gone a handful of times now and the last few, I've been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. Our server, the last two times, hasn't offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). The first time, we didn't know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. The second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.

But the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. And we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone's attention, we'd have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.

He (or the kitchen, can't be sure) slathered my turkey burger in Russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and I had a whole conversation that went something like this:

Me: ""Could I please have the Russian dressing on the side or not at all?""

Him: ""So, look, do you want it or not?""

Look, FLO, I don't want it at all, I was just trying to be flexible. Instead, I had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-Russian my turkey burger, which if I'm being honest, wasn't that great. (The turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip 'em.)

My other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. I appreciate that it's Vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but I'd like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. And this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it's seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying to enjoy your sliders. It's just not my jam, so to speak.

I can highly recommend the Gold Standard and the Steakhouse burger, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. I like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  Two of my friends have told me the Captain Hook salmon burger is also really good.  

Other high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. They menu has expanded as well and they've got a lot of interesting choices. They're great at their social media, too. Love that.

Location:  Located in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel right outside of Marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  Definite positive points in my book.

Atmosphere:  The top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a Cosmo hotel food establishment.  I honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  Very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  There is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and LCD tvs behind the bar.  Beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.

Food:  
-Fried pickles
-""Rising sun burger""
-Sweet potato fries
-Shoestring fries

Fried pickles baby!  Money. Ok honestly this was the first time I had fried pickles in my life, and well I am a DIE HARD pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  They give you a little tin with some breaded fried pickles in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  What is a caper berry? Yes first time I have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon I guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  But yah, it was pretty darn good.  I was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  Also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  We both having similar tastes, the gf and I ordered ""The Rising Sun"" burger.  To be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (I'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  Well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  Kobe beef patty with a Teri Glaze, brought me back to Punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to the burger, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  Then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of the burger, waiting to make its presence known.  This my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  Quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  You also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  Both of which are quite tasty, as I got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  They come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  I didn't want to copy the gf as I wanted the shoestring, so I convinced her to ask to upgrade to sweet potato fries.  They come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  For the taste of each of the fries, both were VERY good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  Also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!

Price:  Ok so this is always the boohoo side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.

Verdict:  Holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger\/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  It's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  You really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  In comparison, for $16-17 I would take it over BLT's Wagyu beef burger & Max Brenner's Kobe burger any day for the same price range.  It's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooOOd for some good burgers!

The drink menu is extensive and they have a great selection of beer.  I ordered the Ahi Sliders and my boyfriend had the Nom Nom Burger.  We split his fries and it was plenty of food, since they also do popcorn for the table as an appetizer.  My only downside is that the seating is a little close together, but I've noticed that's pretty much the norm everywhere in town.  Very European to me- maybe I just like my space?

Great for large parties! We went here on a Saturday night for my friend's birthday. There were 20 of us, and we had a great time. Serive was good for a large party. 

Classic Sliders: 2 small (2 bite) sliders served with chips. Very small portion. Additional $2 charge for cheese. Good, but don't expect to get full.

Lobeter rolls served with coleslaw: ya.... wasn't a fan. I don't know what I was expecting, but my boyfriend liked them.

I came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  Once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  The (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  I had the ""Fat Boy"" (UV Candy Bar Vodka, Reese's, Pretzels, Sprinkles, Chocolate-Caramel Popcorn).  A friend had the Vegan Maple Pecan shake (Almond Milk 'ice Cream', Jack Daniel's, Spiced Pecans, Maple Caramel Sauce).  Both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the vegan shake probably won't hit the spot (the sort of ""earthy"" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  The booze was barely detectable, however (I would've liked at least just a little taste, to know I was drinking something alcoholic).

The next day we came back for onion rings, chicken fingers, buffalo chicken dip, and surf and turf quesadillas.  I had a bloody Mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was NOT appetizing.  The apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  I was expecting something more from the ""Southern fried"" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something I could get from Roy Rogers.  Dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that ""pop"" I was expecting when I read the menu description.

We sat in the front every time we came here, so I can't comment on the rear seating area, but I will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.  

All told, try the shakes.  Maybe try the burgers (can't comment directly, but I wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  Apps are basically TGI Friday's quality.",1,0,0

We were looking for a place inside the Cosmo to eat (besides Wicked Spoon, which we went to more than once already) and ended up here. I was really disappointed by the food here.

I ordered the California Turkey w\/ Shoestring Fries, along with a fried egg on top. I've had turkey burgers at other places before that were tasty, but this place didn't get it right at all. The meat was dry and there was no flavor to it. What made it even worse was that they stuck the big toothpick right into the fried egg. The yolk broke and started running before my dish even got to me. It got to the point where I had to use a knife and fork to eat, because the bottom of the patty got so soggy that I couldn't even pick up my burger.

Service was okay. The waitress took our orders and brought out the food pretty fast, and checked on us occasionally. When we asked to split the check by a certain amount, the waitress said she could only split it 50\/50.

I recently hosted a bachelorette party in Las Vegas, so since we were staying at the Cosmo I figured it would be best to host a lunch event at Holsteins.  Now I've been to Holsteins many times, so I was familiar with their shakes and phenomenal burgers, this is review is strictly for the event. 

First off, communication.  I filled out some information to get contacted via their webpage for an event, and I was promptly contact the next day by Ku'uipo.  I received an email with options for the prix-fixe menu.  They had a very reasonable per person minimum spend for a party of between 15-20 people on a Saturday lunch. Once I communicated my details to Ku'uipo I was promptly issued contract details with a final guest count TBD a few weeks before the event.  

Next, changes. One thing that really made my day is that I was able to change the menu throughout the process and Ku'uipo was so helpful and prompt getting the menu changes done.  Also they have an online service that generates your menu and contract so changes can be seen quickly.  I really appreciated that so i didn't have to keep going through emails of .pdfs to find the most recent menu\/contract.  It made this event really convient to do.

Lastly, service.  Again, I could go on and on about how delicious the food was and how grand the milkshakes are, but the service we received for our party of 15 was phenomenal.  The manager, whose name I am so bummed I forgot, took exceptional care for our party.  We had 2 girls have to miss the event due to family emergencies and was so nice to let us get their burgers to go and also comp 2 milkshakes for our party.  I know that having a large party puts stress on a kitchen, so I can't begin to explain how amazing that was.  Also we never had to ask for refills nor were we waiting long for food once our individual orders were placed.  Our waitress and bussers were on point. Again I wish I could remember their names, but we were the only party of 15 on Saturday, November 18th from 11:30-1:30pm, so please tell them I truly appreciate their service.

We ordered a coffee which was completely watered down and tasteless, the turkey burger, and the Chicago dogs. The turkey burger was inedible but I was starving so I had half.

After a combination of a mono-rail excursion, then a little bit of street hiking (shout out to Eugene L) along with good ol' fashioned Casino hopping, we arrived at the fancy-hip casual dining of Holstein's. Was it worth the trip? Eh not so much...

The Urth Burger itself was quite tasty. It had the faint flavor of a Thanksgiving Day stuffing. I actually liked it by itself. Unfortunately the thick bun, and toppings overwhelmed the flavor of the main ingredient. It's not bad by any means, it's just nothing special.

The thick cut fries that came with it were very good. Crisp & well seasoned, you can't ask for much more in a deep fried slice of potato. Unfortunately the Sweet Potato Fries that we ordered on the side came out cold as if they had been sitting out until we ordered them. 

When our waitress was asked to replace them with a fresh order, all service was halted to our table after she brought out a much better tasting fresh batch. She refilled the water glasses at the table next to us, while leaving mine nearly empty. She didn't offer to refill it until she brought the check at the end of the meal. By then we were ready to go.

Located next to Eggslut, Holsteins is a large restaurant with tons of tables for pairs or large groups which makes for a more comfortable dining experience.

We were served their House Cajun Popcorn which was savory, well spiced and totally addicting to eat. I ordered the Rising Sun, which was the most recommended item and looked to be the most appealing based on ingredients and photos to me. We weren't quite in the mood for milkshakes this time around and found the burgers themselves were filling as is.

The Rising Sun burger consisted of a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. I ordered the burger Medium. I would have to agree with fellow Yelper, Vivian T. and say that the burger definitely sounds better than it tasted. The components of the burger were great, but I found the beef patty to be overdone, dry and came out lukewarm. I would say if the patty itself was cooked to either a Medium Rare or Medium and came out hot, it would've been a lot better. The tempura avocado and the spicy mayo gave this burger more richness and worked well with the other components of the burger. The bun itself was substantial enough to hold everything together without being soggy or breaking apart. Ordered fries to go with my burger and they were very typical.

Service was attentive and reasonable for such a large restaurant. Decor had comical cow motifs and had plenty of lighting. Noise volume average. Price point reasonable as well, burger tasted good, just issues with temperature and doneness.

We took our friend Seth out to dinner during the 2012 Olympia Expo weekend here in Vegas and boy did we pick the RIGHT spot to WOW our friend with a gourmet burger. Apparently where he's from, you have to drive miles and miles to get a decent ""gourmet"" meal.

The wait wasn't so bad either on a busy Saturday night during the dinner rush hour. We put our names down on the wait list and gave them one of our cell phone numbers.The wait was only 15-20 minutes and we were seated inside the dining area instead of the bar (which is good cuz apparently by 9:30pm, there's a DJ booth set up in the bar area and we prefer to have good convos during dinner and not have to yell or scream at each other).

Since I had a burger in Vegas the previous 2 nights I opted to order something else off the menu while the boys both ordered themselves some burgers. I got the Surf & Turf Quesadilla. We also ordered onion rings to start and they sure were bomb diggity. Very crispy with huge ass oninos and I could bite through each one easily. Which is a major bonus for me since I have a horrible underbite. When my quesadilla came out, I dove right in and noticed how amazingly soft and flavorful the tortilla was. The quesadilla comes with Broiled Steak and Maine Lobster stuffed with Manchego Cheese and the avocado cream on top was seriously like the best creamy jizz shot you've ever tasted. ;)

For dessert we got The Candy Store which came with 5 cute little cake-pop like delectables. They're a bit pricey, but you're in Vegas and since we don't drink I didn't mind gettin a nice sugar high for a hefty price.

We also got the homemade blueberry pop tart with red velvet popcorn and sweet corn ice cream that sat on top of the most decadent lemon tart reduction. OMG! Amazeballs!

So there you have it, two people who don't eat burgers in an establishment that serves primarily burgers.

So why did I rate it so highly? The shakes. Actually they're called bam-boozled shakes because they have alcohol. How can you see a TIRAMISU shake on a menu and NOT order it? It was like someone blended up a really good tiramisu with some ice cream. I could slightly taste the alcohol, which was perfect for the shake.

The decor is also pretty fun. There are graffitied mascots all over the walls that make it feel like a fun and vibrant place to have lunch. My only issue is with the crazy outfits for the waitresses in the bar area. I know it's Vegas and all, but the Hooters shorts don't really go with anything else there.

The food was not as good, but still reasonable. I got some crazy Kung Pao Tamale. It sounded really good, and was presented quite well. I thought the first few bites were great, but then it got tedious (and mind you it was a small dish). There was too much salt\/MSG and the sauce was too sweet. Together they made for a lot of flavor at first, but just got difficult to eat after a few bites. So I'm giving it some credit because it was flavorful. I'm not sure if it was a trial dish because I don't think they're offering it anymore. My wife got the veggie burger, which was okay.

Still, I will be going again next time I'm in Vegas just for some fries and a shake!",4,3,1

Sipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)

The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http:\/\/su.pr\/2KKpvM

-our server\/bartender was very patient and attentive. Explained what was popular\/what he recommended

-they had boozy shakes that looked absolutely delicious. If I wasn't so stuffed already, I would've totally ordered one.

Made a reservation on Open Table while at the MGM for a show, and took a stroll down the strip and made it in plenty of time before our reservation. Situated in the Cosmo it's pretty easy to find if you just follow your nose.   They were happy to seat us early even though it was a little busy.  

The menu is a bit to take in as there is so much that looks so good... how do you decide.  I opted for the Holstein Beef sliders and my companion went for something a little more spicy the El Caliente.  

My sliders were really good.  Not over cooked, and a great size for the buns they were served on.  And as everyone else has stated, the homemade ketchup ROCKED!  

I'm not really into the spicy stuff, but I did have a small taste and it was pretty good.  I could also tell by the lack of conversation and the amount of time it took him to eat it.. was later reported to be very good and a decent size for a large appetite.   I was able to snake a few of his fries and could really only finish 2 of the 3 sliders so they worked out well.

Holsteins is definitely one of the best.   I'd say the burgers are probably better then Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay.  And i'd probably end up frequenting Holsteins more then Burger Bar due to the Cosmo being in a much better location on The Strip.

I got the Gold Standard which is the sirloin burger with all the trimings.   I knew the burger wasn't going to disappoint after the first bite of the nicely toasted bun.  You cannot believe how many burger places fail to toast the buns correctly.  

The aged goat cheddar was a little too much though I think.   Halfway into the burger and the taste of the cheese was getting old.  It might have been better with just regular aged cheddar.    I did find that adding some horseradish to the burger was a nice compliment to the goat cheese.

You'd think a good burger would be easy to make but a lot of places fail.  You want to be able to taste the burger patty, the cheese, the bacon, and whatever else is on the burger both distinctly and as a combination.  A lot of places make their burgers so you can only taste one or two of the ingredients.   Holsteins does a good job of creating a ""complete"" burger experience  :)

Both were over cooked for medium rare and the barmaid couldn't have given a shit about service. The ""gold standard"" should be ""the lame and predictable"". For $18 definitely not worth the money.

I'm always looking for a GREAT burger so when I hear about Holstein's I was eager to try it. Matching the vibe of the Cosmopolitan, Holstein's is a burger joint with a mix of night life.

Service here was great as our server was quite friendly. We sat in the bar area since there was no wait. But I wouldn't recommend eating in the bar area tables. The tables are too low for eating. I scoured the menu for all the unique options for burgers and eventually decided on the Gold Standard, one of their most popular burgers. It was well-cooked with some good toppings. I did not care for the chive-garlic aioli. It wasn't a flavor I cared for. The standard french fries are good though.

Holstein's is well known for their grown-up milkshakes with liquor in them. Go ahead and hate me for not trying one but it sounded too rich and thick for me at the time. I was already quite full.

Overall, Holstein's wasn't too bad. The burger was average to good but not quite award-winning for me personally. But I appreciated the friendly service and those cartoon cows are just oh so cute!",3,1,3

We could spend our money on Secret Pizza for the umpteenth time or try something new. The decor is cool for this little place and it's SUPER convenient if you're staying there, literally off the elevators and walk like 10 steps. 

We got the lobster mac and cheese which was good with chunks of lobster but really small. I would not get this again, very anti-climactic for a relatively luxurious dish and flavor was bland. The onion rings were slightly above average and I would totally eat again. Lastly got the bulgogi quesadilla and speaking as a Korean who lives in Ktown and has access to great Kfood 24\/7, the quesadilla was legit AF. It got soggy and again was small portioned but oh well you're in vegas. The payment process was easy as we just charged to the room and paid the remaining balance minus $25 credit we had. For the price, none of the dishes are worth it but the least offensive dish with most value and uniqueness was the bulgogi quesadilla. Sober I might not come here but drunk?

There are tons of street chic art hung all over the walls of the restaurant which makes its interior design fun and appealing for guests. Since it's  more of a casual setting it's a nice place to bring friends even if you don't plan on going to Marquee or anywhere else fancy for the night.  

They have shakes mixed WITH alcohol, called their bam-boozled shakes. My absolute favorite is the Birthday Cake which has 3 Olives Cake Vodka, Birthday Cake Crumble, vanilla ice cream and sprinkles. OHHH SOOO GOOD. It. Is. To. Die. For. Plus they give you the tin they make the shake in so it feels like you're getting extra. Adding a little to the waist? I don't mind for this heavenly treat.

The sides are fantastic. Truffle lobster Mac n cheese... Need I say more? They have great tiny buns too and some great Chicago dogs if you aren't too hungry, but still want a great meal. 

Now the burgers are what you should come here for. Try any one. I'm sure there isn't one that will disappoint your taste buds. Can't choose? Well you can't ever go wrong with the Gold Standard.

I do note what I tried might have differed from what others had. I am Not saying Holsteins is a bad burger as it was OK and Good but for a high priced burger I was expecting the beef  patty a full fat one to taste better with more flavor and juice than when I cook a 93% lean burger at home.

I got the Fungi Burger. I was expecting more mushrooms than onions but it was mostly onions that were very good I add. I upgraded the aged sirloin beef to wagu style since I buy this meat once in a while and it's very good. My burger was juicy enough but did lack flavor. I was expecting it to taste really good and beefy. I liked the study well sized bun but my sweet potato fried seemed old.

My husband had a dry aged sirloin burger with bacon , goat cheddar cheese and arugula. He had to send back his bun because it was hard as a rock. We laughed about it with the waiter and got a new one fast. His medium rare burger was lacking in taste and was oddly juiceless.

The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something. 

Actually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had. 

Those who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.

It's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections.

The best part of coming here a few years back was the Kobe beef burger and the massive selection of fun boozy shakes. Eleven to choose from!
But times they are a changing. First of all i ordered the cookies and cream shake (pictured) and it was phenomenal but it was one of only 6 options. I don't know what happened to the other 5 but they have been eliminated from our consideration. 
I chose to order the California Turkey in hopes of it being a lighter choice. I'd much rather save those empty calories for the shake. Hindsight revealed I shouldn't have ordered it at all. Based on the menu description and my waitress' option of ""would I like that on white or wheat bread"" I thought I was getting a turkey sandwich. What I got was a dried up patty of tasteless ground turkey between a bun. Not the wheat bread I was offered. There was no avocado at all and the ""spouts, cucumber slaw"" was sparse at best and LOADED with salt!  The avocado was completely absent along with the Russian dressing. I unfortunately opted for the sweet potato fries for an additional $2.50 and was left completely perplexed. Exactly what kind of manipulation process is done to remove any and all flavor from a sweet potato?  I didn't know that was possible let alone a process worthy of a $2.50 charge. 
Our waitress, upon delivery of our shake, informed us that she was supplying us with a drip plate for the ginormous ice cream sandwich that she guaranteed would melt on us. She also took it upon herself to let us know that we should probably stop eating our turkey sawdust and eat the ice cream before it melts. Three times. She stopped by 3 times. Each time with a little more attitude because we weren't taking her seriously that ice cream does indeed melt.

Unique is a good word.  It was okay.  I'm pretty sure its made of mostly chickpeas and corn.  The shoestring fries were pretty amazing though.

Also, the alcoholic shakes are pretty excellent.  Unfortunately only one works for the dairy free crowd.

Our waitress Ashley was super sweet, friendly and attentive, yay!

We only ordered the two shakes and the restaurant across the dining area and lounge only had 3 groups . .  . yet it took 20 minutes to get our shake while all the staff just stood around. It would have been a five star review if not for the unexpected and really unnecessary wait time.

anywho, the shakes came and OMG! These are MASSIVE! And so extravagant! (see pics!)

The A-Chocolypse Now shake was our less favorite of the two shakes. chocolate vodka with oreos, chocolate sauce, topped with a brownie, chocolate pocky stick, hershey bars, and the glass was coated in vanilla frosting and chocolate crunchies. The shake wasnt as boozy as the other, and not that chocolatey which we were hoping for. Very sweet, the brownie was decent, but overall nothing exciting.

The cookie & cream on the other hand killed it! That is where the four star review comes from! whipped cream vodka infused in the shake, mixed with chocolate chip and oreo cookies, topped with a GIANT Ice cream sandwich, coated in vanilla frosting and cookies!
This was very boozy, yet blended well with the shake, not too sweet, amazing flavor, the cookies offered a nice change in texture with the crunch, the ice cream sandwich was good but the entire thing was frozen - seems they freeze them all ahead and don't thaw out, so it was kind of a bummer.

Mac and cheese was delish, with a slight hint of truffle and chunks of lobster. Awesome. Buffalo chicken dip came recommended by the waitress but I would not order it.

Situated inside the Cosmo, right across from the Chandelier bar, Holstein's is super modern, bright and spacious.  We put our name in and were told it'd be a 20-30 minute wait. They take your phone number so they can call to tell you -- only I had HORRIBLE reception inside the Cosmo, so I missed the call and returned to the front desk about 10 minutes after they called.  We were seated immediately, which was great.  While perusing the menu, some bacon\/cheddar infused popcorn came out in a little metal pail, courtesy of the chef.  

There were so many burgers to choose from. We chose the big fat Greek burger and the surf and turf mini-burgers.  Thankfully, we had decided to share because the Greek burger was THE best burger I think I may have ever eaten.  I'm drooling a little bit just thinking about it. Lamb, tatziki, red onion, feta cream... bursting with flavor.  The surf and turf mini-burgers were just meh even with the bearnaise sace. 

Now, the most shocking part of the menu wasn't their amazing beer selections or even the bamboozled milkshakes -- but that their ""fat"" fries (as I call them) were GOOD. If you follow me on here at all, you know that I have a strong aversion to anything but shoestring fries for the fry\/flavor ratio.  These were perfectly seasoned; I definitely snuck more than a couple from my friends plate. hehe

Based on the service we received -- I'd suggest not being in a rush to get anywhere or in the mood to order something additional. The girls sitting next to us waited for easy 20 minutes before the server came over to give them their bill after asking for it and then there was a discrepancy.

We ordered the spicy calamari to share, loved the thin fried slivers of jalepenos, definitely gave it an awesome kick.  

I had the rising sun burger and thought it was delicious---I'm not a super saucy kinda gal, so maybe next time if I have it I will ask for the teriyaki to be on the side as opposed to the burger patty itself.  The tempura avocado on top of the burger was to die for.  The fries were ok, nothing to get excited over--maybe if they were sprinkled with some sort of seasoning it would have been a little better---or they could have had optional sprinkles to add on top--like garlic wasabi or parmesan--something like that--the fries were pretty plain.

Hubby had the steakhouse burger and loved it, he could barely finish it.  He said the flavors were very good.

We split a campfire s'mores booze shake and it was nothing short of glorious.  Something about marshmallow vodka that just seems so right.

Since Christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at Holsteins.

I ordered the Crazy Bird ($16) which was OK - not terrible, but not something I'd order again either. It was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. In the description it listed garlic aioli which is why I leaned towards ordering that item, but I honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.

Mi madre went with Captain Hook ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. That was much more worth the money and if I ever paid a visit again, that's probably what I would order. The salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving the burger a strong salmon kick.

My boyfriend went with the Big Fat Greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a Greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. That was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. The boyfriend quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.

There were definitely other options I would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and I just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. All comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for sweet potato fries or onion rings for an extra $2.

The bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but I guess I shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the Strip. 

Would I come here again? Sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. As for the shakes, I think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. As for me, a non-drinker, I'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...",2,2,3

Service was a little disjointed.  A manager type guy came by and said our waiter would be right with us.  Then he came by again and asked if he could get our drink order.  I thought that was great, but then it seemed to take awhile to get our drinks.  

Beer selection was very good and reasonably priced.  B\/f got the sliders, which he liked.  I had the kobe and potato chip burger which was very good.  Also had the shoestring fries, which I liked but would probably choose the steak-cut next time.

We only had to wait a little while for a table but the bar area is weird because you can't stand by the bar because the people in the booths in the bar area (which are really low) then yell at you for blocking the tv.

My friends and I came for brunch even though we weren't hungover, since we were looking for a good burger. It was packed at the bar since there were a good amount of people here to watch the conference finals for football, and they were charging a $40 minimum or something crazy to watch from the ""lounge"" area behind the bar seats. We lucked out and got one of the last tables at the restaurant part with a TV, and had a good lunch and spot to watch the game. We tried:

-Complimentary Popcorn (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=6A9_UPW4c-N_pt7j2bMD9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Super addicting- they sprinkle a spicy-ish powder on top, and the popcorn is nice and crispy. A good way to start the meal, but it's also difficult to stop eating.
-Captain Hook (Seared Salmon w\/Remoulade Sauce, Smoked Salmon, Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Served w\/Fries, $17, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=eelZKpVyJlyG3YvjPoapeA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I really liked this burger- the salmon was cooked perfectly, and it was a nice change from the other beef burgers we tried. Recommended! Their regular fries are just average- they needed to be fried more as well as more salt.
-The Fun-Ghi (Beef Patty Topped w\/Forest Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion, Gruyere Cheese, Frisee, Truffle Mayo, $17 + Onion Rings $2.50, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=kmCDudtCE5AnL5skhFm_aQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good flavor, but really salty. You have to like mushrooms and caramelized onions to like this burger, and the gruyere was quite overpowering. This wasn't a bad burger aside from the saltiness, but I liked the other two we ordered more. The onion rings were pretty disappointing since the breading was way too thick\/heavy, so I wouldn't get those again.
 -The Rising Sun (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado, $18 + Sweet Potato Fries $2.50, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=KuT9_8CAr2V-s4iULriszQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was our favorite burger since it was also the most unique. It was borderline too salty, but the crispy yam and avocado helped save it. Highly recommended! The sweet potato fries were also our favorite out of the fries\/onion ring- they had the perfect amount of crispiness.
-Virgin Frozen Grasshopper Milkshake (Peppermint, Chocolate, $9, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=JXv6Xbd4MgSDGFqwgmtNNQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, this was a good mint chocolate chip inspired milkshake. You'll be crunching on chocolate bits throughout though.
-Bloody Mary ($13): Yuck, do not bother ordering this here, this was a waste of money. It needed more spices, and there was no celery stick! 

Our server was new, and you could tell he was a bit nervous. However, he was really nice as was the other staff- they originally gave me regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, and were apologetic when I pointed it out and went to put in an order for the sweet potato fries right away.

Sunday before checkout and we decided to eat here. It was filled with testosterone filled men watching football and yelling at the tv. Not my idea of dining out.

Fried pickles were exactly what it was. Not a fan.

Calamari was actually tasty. Not the traditional with sauce on the side. It was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalapeños!

The gold standard burger was ok. Supposedly the best burger in Vegas but not to my standard. I asked for medium and it came out well done. It was too charred. Only tasted the burnt meat. The idea of the burger was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that's it. Just the idea was great.

I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.

Their spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.

The ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?

Predominantly our trip was based on a BBQ pilgrimage to the holy lands of BBQ but we had our fair share of burgers along the way.

We had the Gold Standard Burger and Buffalo Wings. The burger was outstanding with a medium rare, dry aged sirloin patty, smoked bacon, aged goat cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and chive and garlic aioli but as per the usual, I'll rewrite the menu slightly in adding wild mushrooms.

The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly and all the flavours worked well together but only thing that I wasn't impressed with fries weren't crispy which is a big oversight for me and often a comment on a restaurant because I wonder if they can't get fries right, what the standard of other items might be.

It was unfortunate that the Buffalo Wings were way too acidic and vinegary for me and the girlfriend declined to eat any more after her first. A little more balance in the sauce and also a little crispier would have made them awesome though.

Overall I'd definitely go back for a burger again but I'd make sure that I asked for the chips to be extra crispy.

Now my food reputation has gone down.  I was really excited for alcohol shakes and gourmet burgers.  What did I get?  Regular shake and below-average burger.

I got the Brown Cow Float because I love root beer.  For a root beer float, this is pretty good even with the chocolate pop rocks annoyingly popping in my mouth.  I did not taste the Smirnoff whipped cream vodka at all though but judging by the slight warmth in my face, something must have been in there.

Next was the Machete burger which had Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli.  I asked for it medium rare and it came out medium.  Quality of the beef and the seasoning of it didn't seem that great.  This burger sounds spicy but isn't at all.  Bread was a bit dry.

Our group also shared the lobster mac 'n cheese and buffalo wings which aren't worth going into detail for.  Mac 'n cheese is enough for 2-4 people to take a couple bites and is overpriced.  Buffalo wings were standard.

I came in for a late lunch so they had me sit at the bar.  I'm not a big fan of sitting at the bar to eat so that instantly turned me off when they offered it to me, but the bartender was pretty helpful.

Based off my friend's recommendation (Jesiree B.), I ordered the Rising Sun Burger (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2wgwTAz)- Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, and Tempura Avocado.  The Burger was cooked really good and all the toppings worked well together.  I loved the Crispy Yams which gave the Burger a nice flavorful crunch.  I thought the Tempura Avocado was a bit much though and didn't exactly go well with the Teriyaki Glaze.  Good burger overall though, it had it's very own distinct look and taste.  And the Skinny Fries that came with it were crispy and seasoned very well.

The Black Cow Float was incredible and actually became the highlight of my meal (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2wfqRAw) - Coca-Cola,  Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry Vodka, and Chocolate Covered Pop Rocks!  It was a explosion of flavor in my mouth, literally!!  It could be because I'm a little late to the Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola party since it was the first time I've had the infamous combo.

My sister and I settled on the Hen House (has bacon and a fried egg, bam!) while the others got Korean Bull'Gogi (fried egg and lots of kimchi) and The Rising Sun (teriyaki). The waiter was super patient and helpful with us when we tried to decided and even allowed for us to cut burgers in half to share. If you decide for smaller portions, they even have sliders which is a great option for those who wanna keep it light before dancing.

The burgers came out with either shoestring or steakcut fries and both were delicious. I think I may have been a fan of the shoestring though as it had a great crisp to it while steakcut had a great potato-y inside. The burgers were cooked exactly how we we wanted (in my case it was medium) and was a big-ass burger. I'm glad I opted to share mine with someone because I wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own. 

I'd definitely come here in the future to eat if I'm headed to the club since it's right across from Holsteins but I gotta go back next time to try their shakes!

However, the portions size for a burger joint is pretty sad. They give you a small bucket with French fries to make the burger seem much larger than it actually is, but once you pick it up it's about the size of something off the dollar menu at McDonald's. The decor was a mix of nice restaurant and tacky paintings of cows during the final bookaki scene. It was quite disturbing. I also found it odd the hostess was wearing a nice black dress and the waiters wore button downs and black ties but the female bartenders were dressed for a pedophiles paradise, with hot pink short, knee high socks, sneakers and blue v-neck t-shirts.

I was so excited to have a group on for this place and had two great meals here prior.  We had the pork belly buns as an appetizer. Recently had the peking duck buns at Bachi Burger and although these were okay, they didn't even compare to the Bachi ones.

I also had a comparable kalbi burger.  Again, the winner goes to Bachi Burger.   In trying to create a asian-fusion burger, leave it to the asians...it was good, but lacking certain flavors, spices.  It's the difference between Chinatown cuisine and PF Changs.  Both can be good, but you can't beat authentic chinese.  

My wife had the Greek style lamb burger.  Now, we had this when they had the slider version a few months back and it was incredible.  I remember being blown away by it.  This full sized burger was dry, not juicy at all.  It had some nice seasoning, but I wasn't too impressed.  

All in all, pretty pricey and not even close to what I remember...I'll choose Bradley Ogden for my high end burger any day; and Bachi Burger for my fusion burger.

However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. 

I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a ""short"" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!

Most of us decided on selections from the ""Big Buns"" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the ""Gold Standard"" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.

With your ""Big Buns"" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!

Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.

I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!",7,4,4

The burger we got, the Gold Standard was stellar!  We added a piece of foie gras which elevated the burger.  It was one of the best I ever had.

The 3 alcoholic shakes we got were by far the best shakes we ever had.  The Pecan Turtle Cheesecake was the best.  It had caramel vodka and small pieces of cheesecake in it.  It was like eating a boozed dessert.

The Red Velvet Cake was solid too.  It had a mini whoopie pie and vodka in it too.  It tasted like taking small bites of red velvet cupcakes.

My favorite burger here is the Rising Sun. It's so good and topped with teriyaki sauce, crispy sweet potato strings and tempura avocado. The flavors come together nicely.

Holsteins is now one of my fav places for a good gourmet burger. I've had the Gold Standard and it is delicious. The garlic aioli complements the rest of the flavors particularly well. I had the fortunate luck of pairing it with a Hefe called Franziskaner my first time there and man oh man, I was in burger-beer heaven. I was in ""beerger"" heaven!! 

This last time though I had the Big Fat Greek. It was great. Feta cheese and olive relish went great together, and I don't even like olives. If you knew my history with olives, you know I say ""F"" olives! But... the olive relish I guess is mixed in with the meat and there ended up being an olive pit in mine. It actually pierced my gums and caused some bleeding. Do not laugh!! It was quite unpleasant. And not even cause of the pit itself, but because I handed back the burger. I actually wanted to keep finishing it. Lol. But Ivan, the manager, was gracious and apologetic... he offered to comp my meal as well as replace my order. Well with a good burger like that I wasn't gonna say no. 

Despite what happened it's not the worst dining experience I've had... not by a long shot. It was appropriately handled. But, had this incident not happened, I think I would still give them 4 stars. Their ""dessert"" menu consists of only shakes which I'm not a fan of unless I'm using it as mouthwash. And, though their burgers are really good, I think some are overpriced by a few $'s... oooooh say, 3 or 4. Even still, from time to time the price, as well as the trip across town, is worth it.

We ended up ordering the cookies and cream shake because I mean since we're here we might as well get one of their epic $15 shakes. It came out and there was an entire ice cream sandwich on top. Needless to say I was very happy. They also gave us the extra shake that didn't fit inside of the milkshake glass which we appreciated! The shake itself tasted like a very basic oreo cookies and cream shake. You could kind of taste a hint of the booze but not a lot. The ice cream sandwich on top was pretty good, but it was very very messy.

I'd come back here again with some friends from out of town or a fun night out. But it's pretty pricey.  One burger and a shake came out to 45 bucks. Spend an extra 5 and you could to go wicked spoon ;)",1,0,0

During our first visit I ordered the Turkey sliders and an Oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. However during this visit, I was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. For this round I ordered the Turkey burger because I hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact I wanted to try something different, I also ordered the Pecan Cheesecake shake off the menu to try something new. When the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then I realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. I had wished I got the oreo shake but it was too late. While waiting for our burgers I decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, I filled myself up with popcorn, that ""milkshake"" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, I was full and didn't even want it anymore. Maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now I can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn.

I got their jalapeño margarita? I forgot the name, but it was really good. The slight spicy flavor went well with the margarita. The boyfriend got their Coffee &Donut adult milkshake. I super liked it. Wasn't crazy sweet and perfect amount of booze. 

We ordered the Gold Standard burger and Lobster Mac&cheese. The burger was delicious. Beef was nice and moist and their bacon inside was slightly glazed I think. The Mac&cheese was also yummy. They give you a good chunks of lobster and it's super creamy. We ended up eating the rest back at the hotel later that night. Used jalapeño kettle chips as scoops because we didn't have forks.

It's a very typical gourmet burger place.  The burgers are fantastic and there are a lot of unique combinations that work very well.  

We ordered the ""gold standard"" and the ""rising sun.""  At $17.50 and $16.50 respectively, these were not inexpensive burgers.  The gold standard features dry aged beef with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli; very very tasty.  The rising sun features kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, cirspy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  I don't think the kobe added anything flavor wise and unfortunately, probably just adds to the cost of the burger.  The tempura avocado however was amazing.  The batter formed a crisp shell and the avocado inside was nice and creamy.  Om nom nom nom.

It started off well - we were greeted promptly and seated quickly without reservations (it was about 1pm on a Friday afternoon).  We entered near the bar on the far end, so it was a little weird when the hostess sent us wandering by ourselves to meet our waitress 30 feet away, rather than have her come and collect us, but OK not a big deal.  We ordered drinks - blood orange cosmo for mom and a grasshopper alcoholic milkshake for me, which lead to being carded and a ""happy birthday"" from the waitress.  All good so far.  The cosmo was quite tasty and the milkshake was almost too decadent.  It was good, but so rich and filling that I immediately thought I had made a strategic error vis a vis my calorie intake for the rest of the day.

There are a variety of burgers on the menu, along with a few non-burger items (not much in the way for vegetarians though).  I went with the gold standard, with onion rings, while mom opted for the basic burger and sweet potato fries - both substitutions incur a slight charge of $1 or $2.  The burgers themselves range from $14 for the basic variety to $28 for one with kobe beef and foie gras.  The ingredients are of good quality, so especially considering the location, the cost would almost be justified except for...

1) they were not correctly cooked; we both ordered medium-well and got medium-rare.  Granted, people have differing ideals of what constitutes medium-well vs. medium-rare but but a burger that is light pink throughout is nowhere near 'well' - medium or not.

2) the biggest sin - the food arrived cold.  The burgers were room temperature and the sides were barely above that and cooled quickly.

We almost sent it back to the kitchen, but had already been waiting close to 45 minutes for it to arrive in the first place and had no interest in sitting there longer.  I ran the rest of my burger through the microwave when we got back to our room and it was quite good when at the proper temperature.  There was no salvaging the onion rings, though.  

At $70 for lunch, I should be able to get my food cooked to my specifications and served at a proper temperature for enjoyable eating.  I might come here if someone else wanted to go (and better yet, pay), but I would probably just order a drink and skip the food.  There are far too many good burger places on and around the Strip to risk being disappointed here again.",2,2,2

They had a large variety of ""Bam Boozled Shaks"" aka boozed up milkshakes. I had a bit of my friend's Oreo Milkshake = yum! (And I don't even like chocolate..)

We were looking for something relaxed for our first dinner in Vegas and did a Yelp search for ""burger.""

We had about a 20 minute wait, though we got there around 9:00pm. They text you when your table is ready, which conveniently allows you to wander around the hotel for a bit. Service was great - very friendly. We liked the popcorn that is provided before the meal - tasted a bit like ranch, but apparently was salt and vinegar.

I ordered the ""Rising Sun"" burger; my partner the ""El Machete."" I think the Rising Sun might have been more successful if they hadn't doused the patty (which was cooked to a perfect, almost medium rare ""medium"") with so much sauce (minus one star). I love salt, but even that was too much for me. The El Machete burger was also very good, with a quiet heat going on in the background thanks to a couple of mellowed Anaheim chiles.

I stole a few bites of my friend's titanic-sized chicken sandwich, which was pretty good. I think that thing could have fed a family of four or something. Eh, but it was average. I could not imagine being able to finish that sandwich. It also came with a side! Cray.

This review goes to the next day, 02\/10\/14, ( yes we went two days in a row because it was that damn good!).  It was busier than the previous day, which is totally fine.  However, I am giving a couple of the waiters that ""helped"" us 1 star.  The hostess was awesome and sat us down right away.  After sitting there for ten minutes we were ready to order (i recommend the Rising Sun).  The waiter, this was around 5 pm, went to EACH table and assisted them.  Our menus were down and closed which is an indication that we were ready.  He did not even introduce himself or asked us if we wanted drinks...nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes assuming that he was going to get back to us after getting drinks for the other table.  Still nothing.  Only until the 3rd time he came back to our section did he notice us.  We're not those high maintenance couples that need acknowledgement every single time, but he didn't apologize for the wait or even introduce himself.  He just asked if we were ready.  Well, we're not in Denny's, we're paying $18 per burger plus other things so I do want decent service.   We didn't order, but asked to move to the front of the restaurant (to get better service there).  Of course, he said yes, but told us to grab our utensil and napkins....thanks guy for becoming even more of an ass.  I wish I knew his name, but like I said, he never introduced himself.
Moving to the front was a good choice because the waitress in the front was very kind and got our orders right away.  Also, the men in all black who bring out the food and drinks are very nice as well.  Our waitress was getting off work and said that Wendy will be taking over and that's when it went down hill AGAIN! She came over to introduce herself and told us that if we needed anything to ask her.  Well, I asked for some refills and she looked shocked at what I asked.  Maybe it was my imagination, who knows.  After about 20-30 minutes, we were about done eating.  She helped the new comers around us, but would always pass us.  We assumed that she was busy, so we let that go.  Finally she came and asked if we wanted desserts, but after burgers and shakes, it was enough.  We declined and she walked away.  This is where it became highly irritating (along with the first waiter). We declined on the desserts and our plates\/glasses were empty, so that's an indication that we were done.  It's pretty common sense that we didn't want more and we would like the check.  We were waiting for about ANOTHER 20 minutes for nothing.  We saw her just standing there talking to her other coworkers.  I didn't know I had to raise my hand for help or go up to her for the check, which i didn't do.  Like I said, we are in an establishment where we were paying close to $80-$100 for two people and I am not going to walk to the register to pay.  She FINALLY came and asked if we wanted the check. (Yeah, we wanted our check 20 min ago.)

I was just flabbergasted at how well-prepared and tasty every single bite of this burger was. There's just nothing more I can say about it. Every single ingredient was prepared well and all the flavors complemented each other and there were just perfect amounts of everything and was just really satisfying to eat.

The fries were also very good. I personally thought, that, for the price and in a place like this on the strip, it was a good deal. You can easily be paying $20+ for a crappier meal on the strip.

I also liked the atmosphere and all the artwork they have hanging around, and our waiter was AWESOME. He got a large tip. He knew he what he was doing, though. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick - we were out of there in under an hour, around DINNER TIME.

I had the Farm House salad which was pretty good. It had mixed greens, kale, asparagus, green beans, edamame, cauliflower, and heirloom tomatoes.

It was pretty tasty, all of the flavors seemed to work together. I just wasn't ""wowed"" by this salad. 

We also ordered some french fries for the table which were soggy and undercooked. I like french fries to be crispy and crunchy. These were soggy and lifeless. The ketchup they serve is really good though and it seems like they make it in house.

The patty lacked in flavor and the fries and onion rings were nothing special. Their pizza popcorn and homemade chips are pretty unique for appetizers.

Day one - Bff had just finished running the Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. Vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  I started with an Absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    Then I ordered The Classic with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. I panicked and went with steakcut.  The burger was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. The fries were good, but nothing spectacular.

Day two - Bff and I both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  Absolut dirty martini? Yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. This time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  They were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  Truly great.  Then we both ordered a burger. I can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. It was awesome. We ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of onion rings. THOSE. WERE. EXCELLENT.

To summarize, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. The only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that I found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. On both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food.",1,2,2

To begin with, the hostesses were very polite and we only had to wait for about ten minutes and they had the option to send a text when the table was ready, allowing us to take a look around the shops located nearby.

Once we were seated, we ordered the Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese and it was incredible. My girlfriend and I fought over the last few bites.

I ordered the Rising Sun burger, cooked medium and I added a fried egg. My girlfriend had the Gold Standard cooked the same with a fried egg as well. Suffice to say, she had major food envy, and after trying hers I could understand. The Rising Sun was in the Top 5 greatest burgers I've ever had.

As an appetizer, I had the truffle lobster mac n' cheese and was very disappointed by this. For the low, low price of just $16.50, you get a small dish, about the size of an iphone, full of mac n' cheese! The lobster seemed almost nonexistent and the truffle was extremely light, too light. Although the saving point for this was the bite-sized BLT that came with it. 

For burgers, the one that stood out the most was the El Machete. Wow that is a good burger and it has a very nice kick to it from the spicy aioli that it's topped with. Their burgers are juicy and cooked the way you like it. Their buns are absolutely amazing too. They're dense enough to uphold those thick, juicy burgers with all their glorious toppings too. But not too dense where it's like you're eating styrofoam. 

My bf had the Long Horn, since what man doesn't like EXTRA meat? It was decent but I like my burgers to have more veggies on them. He liked it also, but agreed that the El Machete just tasted better. 

Their matchstick fries are fried to perfection so they're super crispy on the outside but smooth in the center. However we also had the onion rings and they came out extremely dark in color, so over fried. They didn't taste too bad though. 

I LOVE their milkshakes! If only they weren't so expensive! You CAN get them non-alcoholic, which will shave off about 3 bucks from the menu price. They have some tasty concoctions, including their Drunken Monkey, which is my favorite. I tried the Cap'n Crunch and it was good, but it tasted just like a vanilla milkshake with some ground up cereal. Still not bad though. 

The cons of this place are mostly due to the environment of the restaurant.. The hostess was not friendly at all and barely even said hello. The server was friendly enough, although she could have been more attentive. She disappeared for a while after asking what we'd like to drink. The music is extremely loud. We had heard that the music is usually lower earlier in the day, but the last time I came, it was 6pm and I was still yelling over the music.

This isn't the best place for a nice dinner and conversation, but they can cook up a mean burger. Also, they change the paintings on the walls every once in a while, which is pretty snazzy!",0,0,0

I got the Crazy Bird (I think that's what it was called) which was the chicken burger. It had candied shallots, garlic aioli, cheese, lettuce and kettle chips. I ended up scraping the candied shallots off because I didn't like them much but everything else was spot on! 

My favorite part, however, was the French fries. Absolutely delicious. They didn't taste like fake packaged potatoes you get at a lot of other places and the serving size was good! 

The service was good, I don't know our waitress' name but she was fast and attentive. 

Cons: 

The food took quite long to come out. But I will also mention that it was Saturday night, it didn't seem too busy to me but hey this could've been why. This was the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars. 

The shakes are overpriced. $9 for a basic shake. 

The popcorn they gave didn't really have a taste, but hey it was free so can't really complain there.

I wasn't feeling up to a burger (we ate later in the day and we were going to a show) so I decided to the the bulgogi quesadilla. I asked if I could get the kimchi on the side and they said no, which strikes me as weird since don't they assemble it there? They said it was already mixed together. So, I decided to get the popcorn shrimp, while everyone else got a burger. 

I heard good reviews about the burgers but I didn't try any. I tried their fries and they were great. 

My popcorn shrimp came with actual popcorn but the shrimp and popcorn were the same (delicious) flavor. A little difference could have been nice. It was a small size but it was good for what I wanted. I'd like to come back and try a burger.

Holsteins really has out done themselves with the funky street art hung up all around their restaurant. It keeps the space looking fresh and not dated. The food selection looked great! Though my bf and I didn't order any entrée food items, I noticed some of the other diners eating burgers and fries. The burgers looked big and juicy and would be something I'd be interested in ordering the next time I'm back at Holsteins.

My bf and I came to Holsteins specifically for dessert and we ordered a black and white milkshake to split ($8). While waiting for our dessert, our server brought a bucket of popcorn to the table. The complimentary popcorn may have looked unassuming in the little pail but once we started nibbling on it, we couldn't stop! It was warm, buttery and some pieces had a slight sour bite to it. It was crack popcorn!

The milkshake was rich and oh-so delicious. I'm not particularly fond of sweets but I found myself taking large gulps of it. The whipped cream on top was just enough and truly the perfect compliment to the vanilla and chocolate. There were also little chocolate wafer balls on top of the milkshake that added the perfect crunch.

Bottom line: Word of advice: order one of the milkshakes; you won't regret it.",0,0,0

Not everyone in our group wanted burgers, so we got our food to go. You order and wait at the bar for to-go orders. After much contemplation, I decided to go with The Rising Sun (with shoestring fries) because there were a lot of good reviews for it and it was a unique combination of ingredients for a burger. Well, it was a good choice! It certainly was a unique combo of flavors, and it worked. I don't usually go for the Asian-themed item in a menu, but being a burger, it ended up being a good fusion item. The fries were alright. Not the best I've had.

I would definitely come here again to try another one of their many unique offerings.",1,0,0

I ordered the California Turkey Burger and it was FUNK-EEEEE. Just weird. From the Russian sauce being... who knows what, to the bizarre cucumber slaw that tastes like Thai food, it's a truly odd flavor profile. To be totally fair, the turkey patty was good- flavorful and juicy. The sweet potato fries were bomb and I would order those again. 

Didn't get a shake this time, but I have in the past and I would highly recommend those. I probably wouldn't eat a burger here again, but would come for a shake and snack of fries or a side.",0,0,0

The place is very nice and theres alot of places to sit. The art hanging on the wall has a great playful feel to the place.

Lets get to the food. As far as burger establishments once again i will say that when you charge $20 a burger it better be awesome. I will say that Im a little upset that i spent $70 for 2 burgers and 2 beverages and that was including tip. But spending time with my cousin who was staying here at the cosmo made it worth it.

Fun-Ghi Burger (3\/5)- By itself it would have probably been too much but i added a fried egg and it made the powerful truffle flavor balance out. without the egg i wouldnt have enjoyed the burger as much but i did like it. 

Turkey Burger (4\/5)- My wife had this and she really enjoyed it and said it was well put together.I dont have anything specific to say about it because i didnt try it.

The only way we'll be back is if we go with friends or family it is a great place to socialize and very laidback. Service was great our server really took care of us and for i will be back to enjoy some more burgers. Looking forward to trying the Rising Sun.

You'll love the environment here. It's got a trendy, unique array of decor, much like the rest of the Cosmo. Sort of a street art style. 
The waiter will definitely pressure you to have alcohol, which is as you'd expect, a bit expensive here. We weren't in the mood for any drinks at the time and were feeling pretty cheap with our groupon in hand so we politely declined. He recommended their award winning Gold standard burger for myself, and their asian style burger for my girlfriend. I must say that they both came out heavenly.

Mine was a savory, sirloin steak patty served on blue cheese, arrugula and tomato. I substituted an egg in place of the bacon. Not particularly unique but what can I say-- it was love at first bite. The meat just melted off the burger with each bite, the arrugala complimented the rest of the flavors so well. I devoured every last bit, including the steak fries, which are noteworthy here. something about the way they cook their steak fries gives them this dark brown hue, much like the potato logs that you can get at the grocery deli. I absolutely love this style and much prefer it over the yellow, solid texture of the steak fries at Fatburger or Golden Steer.

Let me also say that my girlfriends meal was absolutely delightful as well. I ended up finishing the last 1\/3 of her burger made with kobe beef and drizzled with a tasty sweet teriyaki glaze. Damn good but I prefer a similar one I had at Bachi. I still think that as far as asian style burgers go, you are better off making a trip to Bachi Burger, but for anything else you ought to give this place a try. 

Perhaps I wouldn't have been so enthusiastic about the food if I had paid full price. This place is far from cheap and my groupon really helped lessen the burden on my wallet. Still, the burger was just so memorable that I could very well see myself coming back here when I'm in the cosmo again.

It's located inside the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.

I went with the rising sun (medium well) with sweet potato fries and my mom ordered the big fat Greek (medium well) with onion rings. I honestly think the rising sun is THE best burger I've ever had. The kobe beef was so juicy, flavorful and literally perfect. The mixture of flavors blended together so well and each bite was like an Asian fusion explosion in your mouth. Amazing!! The crispy yam and tempura avocado add a nice crunchy texture to the juicy beef. I really enjoyed the mixture of flavors and wasn't overwhelmed at all. My mom said she enjoyed her burger as well but I was too full to take a bite of hers. I did taste her onion rings though and they were fantastic! Crunchy, not greasy and the perfect size! Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try a milkshake but I saw a few people order them and they are a work of art. Almost too pretty to drink.

The beef patty was overcooked and did not seem to be seasoned.  The potato chips were a nice touch and appeared to be made in house.  The hamburger was simply lacking flavor.  I'll say that we enjoyed the french fries that came with the hamburger (and all hamburgers at Holsteins.)  The beer selection was admirable and allowed me to an IPA that I've not had before.  Too bad for you that I can't remember the name.  Overall, I think that I'd go back because I got the feeling that they could do better.  Casual, relatively affordable and average from most angles.

It's a restaurant, not a nightclub - however, there's a DJ inside blasting music at above reasonable levels. I asked for them to lower the volume, and they refused. In fact, when I asked, I was told ""yeah, a lot of people ask us to, but we can't."" He said they get a request to turn it down just about every day. I asked if anyone had ever said they liked it loud or commented that they appreciated the music, and he said ""no."" 

There's no dance floor. It's not set up for people to rock out or whatever. It's just a sit-down restaurant inside the mall area of the hotel\/casino. Pretty fucking stupid to play music that loud when no one likes it.

It's not like they are trying to entice people to come in either because the speakers all face inward. Once you step out into the walkway just outside the entrance, the music gets a lot quieter. It was just really absurd listening to ""back dat ass up"" while trying to enjoy a meal and a conversation with my girlfriend. It made it impossible. 

Noise aside, the food was pretty good. Some items were better than others. Burger was okay. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good. Cheesesteak rolls were okay. The milkshake was really good. I would give this place a 4 if it wasn't for the loudness inside. 

Another note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing. Sad cartoons that could have been drawn by peta in an attempt to turn people into vegetarians. Almost as bad a choice as the music. I liked the art, but it was pretty much a bummer. The decor was otherwise pretty good.

I'm a craft beer fiend and I would give this lager a 4-star rating! My boyfriend ordered a pecan shake, it was okay, not the greatest BUT he also asked for no alcohol in his shake so I'm not sure if that altered the taste.

We started out with the lobster mac & cheese...to die for! Literally that, in itself, was the highlight of my visit. I would return just to order that.

I ordered the Steakhouse burger. It wasn't the best burger I've had...sadly, it wasn't close either. I'm a snob when it comes to burgers, but that's because I was raised in Texas, where the meat is organic, real, juicy grass-fed beef. The patty as Holstein's was mediocre at best. It lacked the natural flavor of a beef patty, even being cooked to medium-rare. It was dry and crumbly in my mouth. If it weren't for the other ingredients in my burger, I wouldn't have been able to eat it --- there was just a total lack of flavor and the texture wasn't pleasing to my taste buds.

I thoroughly enjoyed the french fries. I don't normally like fries, but these were thin, crispy and deliciously seasoned! My boyfriend got the sweet potato fries --- light with easy seasoning.

The service was GREAT! Another huge highlight of my visit. Our server was able to answer every question we had with great knowledge of the menu as well as what guests may or may not like.

Overall, I wouldn't return if I was craving a burger... But if a friend wanted to go, I'd go back for the lobster mac & cheese.",0,0,0

This is a great place to go for foods and to get your night started whether you are clubbing or whatever you plan to do when in Vegas. It's also great for locals that want to enjoy an adult milkshake and a burger!! I recommend this place to everyone that comes and visits me!!!

You can come here casually dressed or dressed in your club attire--no judgements ever been made when dining here! Trust, I've been to this restaurant both in casual wear after coming from a concert in the Boulevard Pool and in club attire heading to Marquee after dinner. 

I've tried the Birthday Cake milkshake which is just yum and a monkey one (can't remember the name for the life of me, but I want to say that it had bananas in it).  I've tried the turkey burger sliders and the chicken sandwich. Both were like heaven in my mouth. Their fries and onion rings are great as well!

Great burger for an exuberant price.  I had the Rising Sun which is probably the most unique burger on the menu with tempura fried avocado slices, a ""teriyaki"" which was more of a Korean bulgogi type of sauce, crispy onions and a fried egg which I added manually.  Great burger, but nothing that blew my pants off.

I sat at the bar and the bartender was on top of things.  She was very attentive and always had my drink refilled.  This was an off hour however and I was like one of maybe 15 people in the restaurant.

So when I'm in Vegas on business or pleasure (cue the music):

I stay out too late
Got nothing but shakes to obtain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many Vegas dates 
But I can make my company pay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep boozing
Can't stop, won't stop choosing
It's like I got this cute chick
In my mind
Saying, ""It's gonna be better than getting a quick bite""

'Cause the Card-Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the Waiters gonna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Baby, I'm just gonna get a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
The Bakers gonna bake, bake, bake, bake, bake
And the Bartending Shake-makers gonna make, make, make, make, make
Baby, I'm just gonna get a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake


SHAKES I'VE HAD:
-The Drunken Monkey: being comprised of Reese's & Banana made it an easy choice for the 1st shake I ever had here. It contains Frangelico hazelnut liqueur!
-Pumpkin Pie: pumpkin lovers like myself can rejoice because this treat is offered year-round, instead of being seasonal. It features Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, & Pepitas Brittle. This was the tastiest one I've had.
-Cereal Bowl 2.0: one of their most popular, it has Fruit Loops & Cap'N Crunch mixed with 3 Olives Loopy Vodka.
-The Fat Boy: ok, I didn't try this one, but after consuming a shake here, people mistook for me being the fat boy.

You can't really feel the effects of the alcohol, but it doesn't matter because they're SO DAMN GOOD anyway. Expecting to get buzzed off any of them is like going to Britney Spears' show to hear live music.  They give you the shake excess in a tin also, so it's like you're practically getting 2. 

FOOD NOTES:
-The Crazy Bird: if you're not into burgers but want buns still (and a chicken breast), this is my recommendation as the garlic aioli sauce gives it the right touch.
-If you have a burger or sandwich and get a shake too, you're going to be as full as a Vegas club's guest list on NYE. So, consider sharing items.
-Truffle Lobster 'Mac N Cheese' ($16.50): I ordered this my first visit, and it didn't live up to the hype. I was underwhelmed by the portion too, but found the crispy breading crust pleasing.

OTHER NOTES:
-bar seating is available
-there are times at nights (even on weekends) when it's not that busy
-Holsteins is not owned by Cosmo, so you can't charge it to your room

Although the charges can easily start to add up if you order several things, I don't really have an issue with the prices here. Since it's Vegas, I just ""Shake it Off, I Shake it Off.",17,18,17

   Let me just say I'm a huge Top Chef fan.  Also a huge Yelper.  So I had done a lot of research before our trip to Vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  Having been a fan of Carlos on Top Chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), I really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.
   So, early on a Monday night, we stepped into Holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  Waitress was quick and friendly.  Service could not have been better.  We were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...I ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but I knew I could count on Husband for that and he did indeed order the Birthday cake one).  Having eaten at Wicked Spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger. 
     THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER* \/ 16.5
BEEF PATTY CRUSTED WITH BLACK PEPPER, 
HOLSTEINS CREAMY STEAK SAUCE, MARMALADE 
ONIONS, TOMATO CONFIT, WILD MUSHROOMS, SWISS CHEESE.

    I asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as I don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  He chose shoestring fries for the side.  
   I asked the waitress if the ""Top Chef"" happened to be there on a Monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  She said she didn't know but would check.  Next thing I know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  What a delightful friendly guy!  AND he informed us that he had hired Craig from the same Top Chef series.  Yep.  A little while later Carlos came out with Craig!  Husband took my picture with both of them!  Oh my gosh, I'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and I so respected them and appreciated them for it.  And now I was not only meeting them but eating their food!  This burger was the best burger I've ever had (sorry Bobby Flay, you've finally been surpassed).  And fortunately Husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of the burger so I got it.  (waitress later told us that it had FIVE scoops of ice cream in it).
    So, full, dessert was mentioned.  I said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  No they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  I expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  Next thing I know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and BACON.  YUM YUM YUM.
    THANK YOU Holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to Vegas!  Excellent waitress (sorry I can't remember your name), thank you too and Carlos and Craig, please know you MADE our trip to Vegas this time!",9,1,5

After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein's.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW'S FREAKIN' NAME, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as I'm concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'

So was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.

First of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside\/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein's gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went ""classic"" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50). 

Pricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they're using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (And don't forget - this IS a 'Strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein's ""mascot"".  Cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!

For our 'intro', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....

And then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some 'meat candy' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn't know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.

So, sure, Holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under ""Special Occasions"" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda's section...",2,0,1

My favorites among the ones I tried were the Lemon Drop (what lemon meringue pie would taste like if it were a drink - was there even alcohol??), Grasshopper (creme menthe freshness with a healthy dose of chocolate), and Drunken Monkey (PB chocolate banana nirvana).

I had been riding the wave of trying to find a good burger to appease my senses when I stumbled upon Holstein's.

I'm a huge fan of goat cheese and avocado so I immediately gravitated to the Gold Standard burger and my dining companion chose the Rising Sun. Of course, we ended up trying each other's and, I have to say, I was definitely not disappointed with what was hitting my tastebuds. Both burgers were cooked to perfection and much different than any I have ever eaten; Major points for that.

Right after the drink orders were taken, we received a small bucket full of buttered popcorn. It was a bit salty but it had a lot of flavor. We also ordered the potato chips for $6. It was tasty but not $6 worth. 

For the main course, my friend and I ordered from the Tiny Buns section. We tried the Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Tenderloin Rossini. REMINDER: Those burgers are tiny. The portions are literally 4 bites total. The Crispy Pork bun had too much hoison sauce but the pork was cooked perfectly. The Tenderloin Rossini was definitely worth the $17.50. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection. The downside was that I could not taste the foie gras nor the truffle mayo.

The vibe and decor of the restaurant is cute and energetic and the servers are wonderful and attentive. The menu is also creative and has so many unique options for burger toppings such as cole slaw, tempura avocado, and fried egg. But when it comes down to it the food is just meh. Without even including the fact that the prices are a bit steep for burgers that are on the small side. On more than one occasion the shoestring fries came out overcooked and the meat undercooked (though I did ask for medium rare..). The unique ingredients and flavors also don't meld as much as I'd like them to. 

I do however recommend the Fun-ghi burger which is underrepresented on this Yelp page (beef patty, grilled portobello, truffle oil, frisee) as well as the steak fries which are seasoned and plump. The Gold Standard has VERY strong flavors which didn't tingle my taste buds as much as I hoped it would. I found myself wanting to slather it in some other type of sauce which is never a good sign. Shakes are basic but love the alcoholic options. Also if you want to swap out fries for a side salad it's a $2 charge which is ridiculous because who actually WANTS salad over fries, usually it's an attempt to calm a guilty conscience.

After being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped Popcorn.  It was unnecessary but good.  

Next came juicy Fried Pickles with a really good Caper Mayo Dressing.  A hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  Meanwhile, I had a hard time deciding whether I preferred the delicious Chocolate Milk Shake with Chocolate Syrup or the thick and sweet Whipped Cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  I even lamented to Diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  And, so it did!    

Then the burgers and fries arrived.  For me, a Classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  There was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and I had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty Shoestring Fries that accompanied it.

Meanwhile, Diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare Nom Nom Burger with Kobe Beef and Cheddar Cheese, as well as fulfilling Fat Fries.  Our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room. 

It was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which I expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.",9,3,7

I had been wanting to try this new burger place in the Cosmopolitan for some time. I didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, I did.

I got the Rising Sun burger. It was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. Avocado always makes the burger better. They gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. Uhh.. SHOESTRINGS FRIES of course. I absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. On top of that, I also ordered the Holsteins cobb salad. I have to make sure to keep my food light if I'm going to all these pool parties, you know. I like the cobb. I'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. I did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. 

We had decent service. Could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. We actually waved down our waitress a couple times. But, it was a busy afternoon.

It wasn't that the food was bad, it was actually good. What killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.

I arrived at Holsteins at about 9:15pm on a Monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was ""greeted"" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. After some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling I was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn't even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. Boom, that was it....and then she walked away. We were aghast! WTF? Oh, GAME ON! So, I walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at Opentable.com. Oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for Holsteins...now. I promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. Phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face I greeted the snotty hostess and said I had a reservation. She once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, ""oh, are YOU Carrie?"" After I happily confirmed that I was indeed Carrie...THE Carrie with the 9:30pm Opentable reservation Snotty Hostess said, ""I saw that you JUST made the reservation. (Eyes rolling up a storm) There is a long waiting list, but because you JUST made a reservation I will put your name at the top of the list. But just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table."" I honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. It would serve Holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.

Here is what we ordered:

Bam-boozled ""shakes"" all $11.00

Drunken Monkey
Frozen Grasshopper
Cereal Bowl
Black Cow

They were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. FYI, the Black Cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.

Burgers:

Gold Standard $17.50 - 
Longhorn $16.00
Steakhouse burger $16.50

All the burgers were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. I have indeed ""experienced better."" They are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to sweet potato fries. Sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. Additionally we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which were also mediocre.

Our server was fine, but not fantastic. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. Overall our experience was a less than stellar one. The experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it.

I went with a friend on opening night and everything was perfect; the meat was cooked to order, the toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, the bun was great, and I walked out of there claiming that it might have unseated Burger Bar as one of my favorites (More on Burger Bar in a future article).  The bacon, cheese, and garlic aioli all had great flavor, and didn't compete with each other.  I went back a second time a week later with the always negative writer of our sister site, the Boston Burger Blog, and the meat was very overcooked.  Again the toppings and bun were excellent, but the overcooked meat greatly took away from our experience and flavor.  We both agreed that if the meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, it would have earned several more points.  Being a restaurant that has a burger and shake theme, this is something that really should be right every time.

But as you know, the burger isn't the only factor taken into consideration.  The fries need work.  The first time I ate there our waiter explained that we needed to get the shoestring fries because they were a clone of McDonalds' fries, and they were.  They were really good, and maybe lacked some of the greasiness that coincide with the big chain's version.  The second time they seemed to be a bit different, and almost seemed to stray towards the lackluster fries of Burger King after the Great Change.  The duck fat fries also seemed a bit better the first time than the second.  Another great item were the 'loaded' shakes; mostly classic flavors and mixes with a good amount of alcohol in each one.  While they are a bit expensive, the few that I've tried have all been quite tasty.

I managed to squeeze a third visit here in the midst of my busy schedule, and this time there were more problems.  First of all, we had a horrible wait for food; people sat after us, ate and left before any of our food arrived to our table.  The restaurant was severely understaffed for some convention that was in town that week.  While I understand that rushes do occur, some careful planning and a bit of coordination with the hotel management to see what kind of occupancies you'll have from week to week would be a good idea.  On top of our wait, I got steak fries instead of shoestring, which isn't a deal breaker, but when I'm supposed to be finding anything wrong with my meal this makes it easy.  Like my first visit, the meat was cooked perfectly so this gives me hope that they might be back to their original form, even with a packed house. My Asian themed burger had great flavor overall, and a little bit of a bite which was welcome.  It came topped with an over-easy egg that was cooked perfectly, and a glaze that had good flavor.

All things considered, this restaurant has already brought me in for three separate visits so there is some merit to that.  But the inconsistencies from meal to meal, combined with the not-so-great service prevent me from bumping this burger to the next level.  It's definitely worth a first time visit, if not just to experience the Cosmopolitan property and take in extreme Vegas opulence.",1,0,0

My friends and I went and had a great time at Holstein's - our server, Lucas (I think that was his name) was patient and answered all of our many questions and even chuckled at our cheesy jokes like someone who has been working with drunk people for a long time. 

Lucas brought out Pizza flavored popcorn, which was completely demolished by our hungry group. It was nicely flavored and not too salty which was perfect.

I had the Urth vegetarian burger (house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado, sans avocado) which was very enjoyable and unlike a lot of vegetarian patties, was moist and not dry and crumbly at all.

I also tried a bite of the The Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado). The Kobe burger was juicy and flavorful but what I suggest to Holstein's is that they have a lighter hand for the teriyaki glaze - I felt that the glaze overpowered the flavor of the Kobe beef and spicy mayo, so much so that all I could taste was the sweetness of the glaze which bordered on cloying.

My 5th star is for the Bam-Boozled Nutella Crunch Milkshake (Nutella, frangelico, caramelized hazelnut pieces) Wow. The milkshake was nice and thick and I could taste the frangelico hazelnut liqueur but I can see how someone can drink the whole shake and get a little buzzed afterwards. The hazelnut pieces added the perfect crunch in texture to the shake and this was the best shake I have ever had. 

This is definitely a solid burger place and I am determined to work my way down the list of delicious burgers and shakes (not all at once of course!). It just give me an excuse to go to Holsteins over and over again.",3,1,1

Hubby ordered the Korean Bull-Gogi burger loaded with a nice soy\/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a fried egg atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. This burger was a nice size and had a good side of sweet potato fries with it. I had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. Great flavor on both entrees. Plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. Mine was the Oreo cookie with Bailey's and hubby had the S'mores with rum. Goodness gracious, set me up with another!

Had a friend in town so I suggested to come here. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. With over 2000 reviews, I'm not going to bore you too much with details. 

Couple things:
-you can order your burger how you want it. Well done meat for me please.
-burgers were delicious! My friend and I both ordered the Gold Standard. Not a fan of goat cheese but paired with arugula and that garlic aoli dressing....yum!!!!
-all burgers comes with French fries. Sweet potato fries and onion rings costs extra.
-Yes, my burger cost $18.50. Yes, it was pricey but it IS at The Cosmopolitan and this is typical Vegas Strip pricing.


Now, customer service was the only bad highlight of the night. Our server, TIFFANI, (yes spelled with an I) was a horrible server. Not only did I have to remind her MULTIPLE times to re-fill our drinks, but she acted like my friend and I were the blame when SHE was the one who switched our burgers around when she dropped them off at our table. My friend ordered hers medium rare and mine well done. It was traumatizing for me to bite into a red, bloody burger!!!!!!! We told her what happened and she gave us a blank stare. What she said to us next was unbelievable! She had the nerve to tell us, ""well since you guys got the same kind of burgers....do you just want to switch plates?"" SWITCH PLATES!?!?!  Are you serious!? Yeah, like my friend would want a spat-out, bit-into burger. The nerve of this bi*tch. All she had to do was take the plates back. It's not like her dumba$$ was back there in the kitchen making these burgers in the first place. Thinking about this again, is making me upset. I shouldn't even have left a tip for her. And my friend wanted to give her 20%. Ha!! I stopped her right there. Tiffani should've gotten $0.00 in tips. 

Management, if you ever read this, you should get rid of TIFFANI. Or at least speak to her on how to properly be a good server. Teach her a thing or two about customer service.",8,5,5

The restaurant is on the second floor of the chic Cosmopolitan hotel which is packed with the young and hp on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, and the hostess was not accepting names for a table.  However, we were told we could wait in the bar area and visit her again in a half hour to inquire about a table.

I'm not sure if this is typical, but it seems like a smart business decision on their part -- to get the guests into the bar to buy drinks first.  It worked for my party.

We actually ordered two appetizers from the bar: fried green tomatoes and lobster macaroni & cheese.  Both were excellent, but the macaroni and cheese is other worldly good.

Holstein's ""adult"" shakes all sounded incredibly delicious -- about ten to fifteen listed options including everything from Cap'n Crunch to chocolate covered pop rocks.  I settled on their ""brown cow"" which has root beer, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks and rum.  It was wonderful.

After about 45 minutes in the bar, we finally got a table in the restaurant.  I got the ""gold standard"" burger which -- though not fancy -- was delicious.  The three people in my party each ordered different burgers and different fries (shoestring, steak and sweet potato).  We shared and loved it all.

With dinner, I had the red sangria which was wonderful.  I tried my friend's white sangria which was light and refreshing.

I would definitely recommend Holsteins and would return the next time in Las Vegas.

Final word to the wise: the bar is LOUD.  The music is cranked so incredibly high that I am shocked hotels across the street couldn't hear it.  Conversation in the bar is strained at best.  Once in the restaurant, the music is less assaultive, but the wood-clad restaurant is also naturally loud.  This is a fun restaurant -- but not one to relax and converse in.",0,0,0

I crave them on a regular basis.
At least 4 times a day.

So while in Vegas, I looked for burgers. And my research was made pretty easy because they are EVERYWHERE. Food trucks, chains, gourmet (hello Hubert!)...you name it. And then I stumbled upon Holsteins reviews, and I read a couple of magic words: spiked shakes.
I was sold.

Turns out, that was a pretty good choice. Holsteins actually uses the tender meat of its namesake breed of cow\/beef and the result is a juicy, flavorful patty of deliciousness.
******Nerdy time: Did you know?**********

1. Holsteins are little Dutch princesses. Read: The Netherlands are their country of origin. I hear that their mooing is quite harsh to the ears, and they love eating tulips and gouda, but not always together.

2. They are the highest milk producers in the world. Hence the MILK shakes, duh. They are the lovely black and white ""meu-meu"" of my childhood, and I love 'em.

3. One of them - Pauline Wayne if you please - was the official pet of President Taft and was allowed to graze on the White House lawn, the lucky bitch.

********End of Nerdy TIme***************

The sad thing? They are only in Vegas.
The good thing? Since you are reading these reviews on Yelp, you are most likely in Vegas and can enjoy without gilt.
Hurray!

We shared the Gold Standard with dry aged sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby aregula and garlic-chive aioli (at a whooping $17.40), and the Steakhouse Burger, a patty crusted with black pepper, Holsteins own creamy steak sauce, marmelade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms and Swiss cheese. 
And people, that was pretty close to perfection. Great combination of flavors, a medium rare meat at its best, crispy fries and a Grasshopper milk shake.....aahhhhh....

Took my sister to lunch at Holsteins yesterday afternoon Sunday April 23, 2017 because who can deny alcohol infused milkshakes and natural organic ingredients!!! 

I opted to sit on the comfy sofa in the bar area. After ten minutes of waiting the host came over and asked if I wanted to sit in the dining room because she asked my server twice to come over to our table and she hasn't come by. I was extremely surprised the host wouldn't have notified a manager on duty but I understand she was trying to display compassion. 

Aside from that small service failure the remainder of my experience was pleasant and the food was so delicious!

I ordered:
(1) Cookies and Cream Milkshake 
(1) Campfire Smores Milkshake this milkshake

Their shakes are a fun treat as well.

Also, they give you the extras, so you're really having 2 milkshake glasses instead of one. A tiny girl like me can take one down and be content for the rest of the evening.

Here's a fun tip for you club-goers: Head to Marquee early and get your stamp. Once you're in, get your drank\/dance on for a bit and then leave to go to Holsteins downstairs for a mid-club snack.

Where do I even begin with this place? From the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves, the experience was wonderful. 

From the moment that we arrived at the restaurant, we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off. Being that the majority of the Cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking, there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like Holstein's in there. The lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe, and there's all sorts of cool (cow-related) artwork filling the inside of the restaurant. It's very fun!

On a Friday night, we were seated immediately, which kind of surprised me, being that Holstein's is in a very popular hotel on the strip, and on a night where people are usually out and about. I probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit, though, so there's that. Either way, it was fast, and I like that! Then, as soon as we were seated, we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer, which, I must say, was quite the tasty start to our meal. I actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgers.

Before we even got our burgers, though, I made sure to check in on Yelp! And boy am I glad that I did, because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with Yelp, wherein you get a free beer with your first check-in to the restaurant. I didn't finish it because of how tasty and filling the burger and fries were, but it was really nice! I got a tiny bit of 'tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion, but I can look past that.

When we finally got our food (which didn't take very long at all), it looked so delicious that I had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review. I ordered the Nom Nom burger, which consisted of Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and thousand island dressing, and The Empress, miss Joyce W. ordered the Urth burger, a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and avocado. 

As soon as I took a bite of my burger, I knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger I've ever had. I don't know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that the burger was made with Kobe beef, or that the burger was just plain delicious, but man was it good. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over the burger, and in a generous amount. There was also a generous amount of potato chips on the burger, which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite. I don't think that I had a bite of that burger that didn't have a bit of potato chip in it. The thousand island dressing on the burger was also delicious. The entire burger was just so good, right down to the bun. With just one bite, even The Empress could taste the deliciousness. Even her own vegetarian burger was delicious, which in itself is not something you'd expect to eat at a place like Holstein's where it's all about the beef.

Even the fries and onion rings that we shared were awesomely done. Both of the sides were nice and thick, and in, yet again, generous portions, which I can really appreciate. We couldn't even finish all of it because the burgers were so good and filling, and there was just so much in general.

Overall, Holstein's provided a 5\/5 experience for us through and through. I only wish we'd had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations. I know there wasn't one burger on that menu that I didn't want to try. 

If ever you find yourself in Vegas, I would say to make a point to try out Holstein's.",6,8,11

They also serve a popcorn at your table. I knew it tasted familiar but couldn't put my finger on it...it was pizza flavored popcorn. Interesting.

1. Buffalo Chicken Dip- it was ok. We ordered some ranch to go with it and it made it much better. I would recommend that. 
2. El Caliente burger- I didn't have it, but I was told it was excellent by my dinner companion. No real feedback to offer. 
3. Fun-Ghi Burger- it lacked all of the flavor I was expecting it to have. That was a bummer. It wasn't bad, it was just basic. For $18 I expect better than basic and a lot more flavor. The beef was a good selection, it was cooked perfectly at medium, it just lacked flavor.
4. Fries were ok
5. Onion rings with panko break crumbs were good but also lacked flavor

Burgers are overpriced for what they are. I'd go for the more obscure sounding burgers instead of the more traditional fare. You will not be impressed by the standard burgers (i.e. Gold Standard), since they will taste very familiar at a premium price. Try something like the Rising Sun or the Korean Bulgogi burger; both very good. These burgers always remind me why I love cows so much.

Do not order the chicken & waffle. All you get is one waffle and snack-bar quality chicken fingers with it. Very disappointed on that one. It was like something I could get at a bowling alley.

I settled on The Fun-ghi beef burger with Gruyere, truffle oil, and portabello.  It was delicious and I could taste all the flavors. The patty is not oversized and very juicy.  I ordered medium temperature, but it came out more medium well however I didn't mind because it was still juicy.  Had the shoestring fries which were nice & crispy.

We also had the Ahi Poke appetizer which came out at the same time as our burger.  It was fresh but the flavors were hard to taste but I think it's because the flavors of the burger overpowered while having both dishes at the same time.

Of course, I had to have a shake but opted for a virgin strawberry shake because I didn't want to be tipsy for a wedding later that day.  But I SO wanted to try a bam-boozled shake like the Almond Joy.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE their shoestring fries! They're so fresh and crispy, slightly salted, not too oily! Okay, I might be a bit biased, since I'm not a fan of wedge fries, but seriously, try the shoestring fries once, please!

So far I've tried their Rising Sun (kobe beef with tangy teriyaki sauce) and their Big Fat Greek (lamb with feta). I was extremely happy with every bite of the Rising Sun. I was too full to finish the burger in one sitting. But I think that's just because I stuffed my stomach with like 2 long islands and a beer. Very juicy patty, I asked for medium rare, it came out medium rare. Sauce was a bit overwhelming. Their sauce is very strong in taste, I guess I should have ordered it light on the sauce. But hey, that was my first time. Big Fat Greek wasn't too impressive, I should have stayed with the beef patties. It's not too gamey, so if lamb is not your thing because of that aroma, maybe give this one a try, it's not as strong (which is why I didn't like it as much, I love that aroma). It may not look like a giant burger, but all that feta cheese and yummy meat and other stuff inside kept me very full. I was so close in not finishing my plate again.

If you check in here on foursquare, you can get a free house beer or house margarita. I prefer their beer. It's not the best, but their hef is tolerable. I tried their house margarita, and all I tasted was syrup. I can't complain too much, it was free. My server offered a to-go cup for my beer when I had half a burger and 3\/4 pint of beer left.

He was serving freeze dried bubble gum meringue, for fun and free-of-charge.  ""Eat it fast,"" he said, dropping a 'kiss' shaped dessert into our hands, ""it's really cold.""  We popped each playful ""kiss"" into our mouths and blew cold smoke rings as we crushed the delicate and flavorful meringue.  This single experience was enough for us to save room for the dessert menu.

Feeling glutinous and somewhat playful, we decided to try some of their more childish desserts.  We ordered a Cereal Bowl shake (which tasted exactly like a bowl of Captain Crunch, with premium ice cream and vodka) and something called an Ice Cream Truck, basically ice cream served 4 ways.  The chocolate bacon ice cream sandwich is something I will never forget.  Don't miss it!

The decor was very casual, with some leather booths, wooden paneling, hip music and pop art on the walls.  Atmosphere was loud and the crowd a varied mix of casual diners and pre-clubbers, all clearly attracted to the neon cow.

All-in-all an excellent experience and we will be returning asap!",0,0,0

My friends and I ate here because we were gonna club at the Marquee next door and it had pink cow logo, which piqued my interest. It's a nicer burger place, so you should look presentable and not look hella grimey.

Food:
1) GOLD STANDARD - One of the best burgers I've had. Highly recommended. Aged beef sirloin with arugula, tomato, garlic-chive aioli. You can't go wrong with garlic aioli and goat cheese on a burger. I added a fried egg to it and it just made the burger so much more delicious.
2) DUCK FAT FRIES - Fried in duck fat, but doesn't taste all that different from regular fries. What made it unique was that it came with fried peppers and onions on top, which gave it a slight kick of spicy.
3) STEAK FRIES - the best steak fries I've ever had. I kept eating them even though i was stuffed. Well-seasoned and fried. I need to order more.. *drool

$11 Alcoholic Shakes:
1) FROZEN GRASSHOPPER - chocolate mint shake. It wasn't too minty and a little too sweet. Won't be ordering these overpriced shakes again.
2) OREO SHAKE - Much better. Very smooth oreo shake with alcohol. yummm.
Overall the shakes were good but way too overpriced. only half shot of alcohol.

The burger was good however a bit on the dry side. It was a good size just not on par with The Burger bar or Ramsey burger. One nice thing here though is the fries were included with the burger unlike Ramsey burger (they are included at the burger bar also).

- Lobster Mac & Cheese
I personally quite liked this dish, and it was a fairly decent sized appetizer, especially when shared with 2 people. I think the breading was subtle but added the texture that the dish needed. Perhaps, the cheese could've been even cheesier, as the pasta seemed to overpower it a bit.

- Gold Standard
The aged beef was easily cut with my knife. That's how I usually determine whether they cook medium rare the way I like it. However, the bun was a bit tough to slice through, and that's what ultimately made my meal messy. I do believe that the size of the aged beef was overwhelming in comparison to the condiments. For example, the cheese barely covered the bread.

- A-Chocolypse Now
I have an extreme obsession with chocolate and I can tell you right now that this drink was soooo good. I loved the addition of the little brownie. The server recommended that we try the shakes alcohol free, as it doesn't really do anything to change the drink's taste rather than serve as a novelty experience. My only problem with the drink was that it was so sweet, I got sick of it midway. My partner also got tired of his drink halfway so it was a waste of money. Consider sharing it with somebody. 

Food alone, I would rate this burger joint in comparison to other burger places at a solid 4.

Service added, it means more towards 4 1\/2 due to the fact that our waiter helped us with all our choices on the menu from the moment we sat down. We appreciated his honest, personal opinions about each item we thought about ordering. Another waiter also took our pictures for us, and man... He definitely took it facing my good angle.

I cannot come to Vegas without a stop at this restaurant. Seriously. I often wish that I had starved myself a little more before coming so that I could eat more. It's that good.

Let's start with their bam-boozled shakes. Shakes, yum. Add alcohol? Uh yes please. I've had the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka) the birthday cake (I think this might be new since I don't see it on their online menu. Think sprinkles, and bits of cake), and the drunken monkey (reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico). All amazing.

As for their food, I love their apps. Hello fried cheese curds, truffle lobster mac and cheese, and fried pickles served with fried caper berries, olives, and salami. Though I think their menu has changed. I got the fried pickles again this weekend and there were no other sides to the dish. I was a little sad about it.

Okay, now for the main course. The burgers. I'm already drooling... The Rising Sun burger is still one of my favorites. Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. Wow. No really, wow. The Hen House burger? Delicious but nothing super fancy. The Korean Bull'gogi burger is yum. I'm a sucker for a fried egg and kimchi and this burger has both as well as chili mayo. And last but not least (for the beef burgers anyway), the Gold Standard burger. Beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. You can't be serious.

Don't worry vegan\/vegetarians, there's something for you too. They have a vegan burger which actually sounds pretty tasty and There is a wonderful salmon burger called Captain Hook. The salmon is thick and moist and comes with pickled shallots, caper herbed mayo, and house cured gravlax. Salmon on salmon. I won't say no.

All burgers are served with a side and I love their shoe string fries. Crispy, thin and perfectly salted for my taste.

At this point, if you still care about the ambience and the service, here it is. I like both. The restaurant is nice but not overly fancy.  Service is prompt and friendly but not overbearing. 

After writing this review, I'm tempted to jump in my car and drive down there just for the food. I wish I was kidding...",6,3,3

-Gold Standard Burger

This burger is composed of a variety of high quality ingredients, which serves to highlight the deliciousness of the burger. The aged goat cheese provided a gaminess to the burger, which really elevated the flavor profile. The bacon provided a smokiness, which is reminiscent of a smokehouse. The dry aged patty really brought out a beefiness that is not ordinarily found in most burgers. The tomato aioli, arugula, and other remaining components was able to bind together and make it just a great interpretation of a classic burger.

Coming from all the amazing burger joints in LA, I would say Holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. It beats Umami Burger for sure, is on par with Bachi Burger, but Father's Office still wins. Nothing could beat Father's Office.

Anyway, Holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. The restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. Prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in Cosmopolitan so I think it's pretty fair for Vegas prices. Service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.

I've tried the Gold Standard and the Rising Sun burgers.  Whenever I have these, oh man I am in burger heaven. Gold Standard has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. The Rising Sun has a teriyaki glaze with Kobe beef and tempura avocado!! The avocado seriously is amazinggg. I definitely recommend these two burgers.

Friend across the table ordered the 'Longhorn' and we did a little burger swappage. The Longhorn was also excellent, and the brisket was fantastic. The star of the show for me though was when I sampled the 'Rising Sun'. It was literally an explosion of tastiness in my food hole. I had never heard of tempura avocado, much less considered putting it on a burger, but I think I'm going to put it on all my burgers from now on.

While the burgers all were exceptional, the fries were pretty ordinary. I ordered the duck fat fries myself and was underwhelmed. Not sure what I was expecting, but I thought they would be noticeably different than regular fries. They were tasty, just not different like I expected.

We were not starving, so we opted to share a burger, appetizer and milkshake.  If you're really hungry, you'll be able to finish a burger and shake with no problem. 
They brought out a snack of salt and vinegar popcorn to everyone's table and this stuff is awesome. You'll be asking for another bucket of it.

We had the Drunken Monkey milkshake and it was everything you want an alcoholic milkshake to be.  I would imagine that all the different flavors would be as well.  

We ordered the buffalo chicken wing dip as an appetizer.  I've made this stuff at home and loved it, but wasn't thrilled with their take on it.  It was more like a creamy ranch hot sauce mixture, and you couldn't really find the chicken.  It tasted ok, but it isn't something I'd order again. 

The burger was one of the best I've had.  It was the Steakhouse burger and we ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The flavors popped out all over the place.  If this review were based on the burger alone, I would have given it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, while tasty, the skinny fries were cold.

I came here twice for lunch and both meals were yummy! First time I had some sort of ""Korean quesadilla."" Honestly, this was probably my least favorite thing I had here. It wasn't bad, but there was a couple different types of sauce on it, and I thought they kind of overpowered things. I was the only one who didn't get a burger during this meal, but I nibbled on some fries of those who did (sweet potato and steak fries) & they were yummy! 

For the second lunch I had to try a spiked shake & it was DELICIOUS! I had the one that was supposed to taste like ""cereal"" and it did! I don't know if this is true or not, but I was informed by our waitress that this is one of only two places in the US (maybe the world?) that serves this shake. I also bad some delicious buffalo wings (just the right amount of sauce w\/the right amount of kick) & some Polish sausage sliders (the red peppers were a nice touch).  Everything was great! 

For my ""half"" meal I had the ""hummus guacamole."" This isn't what I was expecting (it was chunkier than I thought), but still tasted good. It came w\/a lot of pita chips. 

The service here was excellent on each occasion. Holsteins is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan (while most of the other restaurants are located on the 3rd floor) and is a little more casual, and therefore it bit cheaper than other restaurants. 

Even though this is pretty standard in Vegas another nice thing about this restaurant is you can get to-go cups for alcohol. One night while wondering around the hotel I just popped in at the bar and got a ""Dragon"" cocktail in a to-go cup. This drink is one of the many at Holsteins that is made w\/Vitamin water.

Luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed Holsteins across the hall from the Marquee. 

First and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. Secondly, the food was well worth it. 

To start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. Next I ordered the Frozen Grasshopper (a Bam-Boozled Shake) that consisted of Peppermint, Chocolate, Crème De Menthe, Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka. While it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after the burger). 

And lastly, their burger. My, what a burger! After being torn between the Gold Standard & Fun-Ghi Big Buns, I decided to go with the Gold Standard. Now this burger is as follows: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. I ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. The sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. The smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. I mean, WOW, what a burger! 

Every bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. All the ingredients played beautifully with one another, and came together to form a great experience.

We split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. The Fun-ghi burger was absolutely delicious! You can taste the truffle in every bite. Truffle and Gruyere cheese in the same burger? Perfection! The Gold Standard is their most popular burger and I can see why. They took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. First, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. Second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! Lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave the burger a lot of flavor. Bacon, bacon, bacon! And for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. Ah-maze-ing! This changed the whole dynamic of the burger! Honestly, I don't even remember what the buns were like because I was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. The only downside to our meal was that I was so excited to have the ""unndon"" cake for dessert that I skipped on the raved about shakes. I came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. Seriously?! Until they bring that back I am not returning. Take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? If you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. Sorry. We ended up getting the Dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 I love anything DDL and #2 it said it had Frosted Flakes cereal in\/on. Normally, I wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the Godiva or S'mores ones from The Cheesecake Factory but the description made this one hard to skip. It had the perfect consistency, too! The densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed gingerbread man and snicker doodle cookies. Salivating much? For the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, FF cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it.

Holsteins is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. There is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area. 

Typically when I have friends in town, we seem to end up at Holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel). Either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).

There is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but I definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. Between my friends and I we tried the Drunken Monkey, Oreo, and Cereal Bowl (tastes just like Captain Crunch). For burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - The Classic, The Longhorn (with beef brisket as well), The Rising Sun (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), The Fun-Ghi (with assorted mushrooms), the El Machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the Billionaire Burger (kobe beef patty with foie gras). The Billionaire burger is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from California that can't get their foie gras anymore. You can also add a fried egg to your burger (which I recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.

The burgers also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. I have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for the substitution of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). I guess next time I'll just indulge in the fries.

Overall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. I'd definitely recommend enjoying the Billionaire Burger at least once.",3,0,1

I've been pleased with every burger that I've tried.

I've had the Gold Standard, Fun-ghi, Steakhouse Burger, and Longhorn Burger with the Steakhouse Burger being my favorite. The Longhorn is the burger I ordered on my most recent visit. I think the cole slaw, barbecue sauce, and brisket with the burger is a very good combination. The Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout from the above average beer selection paired well with my burger.

The price of the burger includes the natural cut fries which are standard, not exceptional. There are plenty of other add-ons, including foie, that you can choose to augment your burger. If you order a shake, you are given a full glass plus the tin. I can't speak at all about dessert.

Service from Shina was excellent on our most recent visit without an extended wait from the kitchen. I would say most of the food is priced at least $3 over what you would expect.

Alex the manager spent more time flirting with the waitress than attending to what was happening. He was 2 tables away from us but oblivious to what was going on.

After polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening. 

The first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins; 

Drunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico Liquor
Cereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla Vodka
Campfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham Crumble
Pork Belly Buns
Salt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary)
The Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado
Gold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W\/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli
The Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W\/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickles

I do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins. 

I can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. 

From what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.

Bilionaire Burger - HOLY S***.  Talk about TOTAL MOUTH RICHNESS TO THE MAXXX.  Here's the thing.. I love foie gras to begin with so there was no hesitation at all to get this burger.  And being from Cali, I had to get it since it's banned here.  Anyway, they were very generous with the foie gras portion.  It was fatty, melt in your mouth goodness.  The ""kobe"" beef patty was fatty and meaty at the same time.  Huge on true BEEF flavor.  I quote ""kobe"" because we should all know by there that REAL kobe beef cannot be sold outside of Japan.  ANYWAY, the truffle mayo was the perfect schmear to compliment all the components in the burger.  The port marmalade onions helped to cut the richness and fattiness of the burger because it had a very distinct vinegar taste.  The brioche bun was toasty, crispy but soft, and buttery as brioche should be.  It holds up well to the rest of the burger.  The frisee was well, frisee and also helped to balanced out the richness of this burger.

I did split this with my girlfriend because I knew beforehand that this burger would more than likely be close to overwhelming on the palette.  Each bite was so rich I felt as if I died each time.

Frozen Grasshopper Shake - YUM!!!! I love chocolate mint to begin with, but when you add chocolate vodka to it, it just makes the shake 100x better.  

OVERALL:  Enjoyed this place very much.  I would definitely consider coming back here to try what else they have to offer.

Decent slice couldn't focus on the FG and that's a bummer!  Kobe is illegal in the US so their blowing smoke when it's on the menu!  Need to clarify its ""Kobe Style "" not real Kobe!

A group of us came here for a birthday. We called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.

The decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. 

The server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.

The star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.

Starting out with the artichoke ""guac"" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.

Now the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.",2,1,1

FYI: came here at night and they card you to get in. super loud music. if you come at night they only serve the late night menu which is a total bummer.

Ordered:

*we order shoe string fries. i have had them before many many times in my life time. yelpers even posted pictures of shoe string fries that they have ordered from here. however apparently the fries that came out looked like regular sized fries. when i asked the server stated yes they are shoe string fries. i must be born yesterday! for reals that was strike number one! 

*we ordered a holsteins beef $12. the menu said tiny bun. which makes us think its a small burger. comes to find out that what they meant by that is sliders. when asked. the waitress stated: it was all they had. seriously. thanks for the heads up! honestly, good service= please brief your customers on what they are ordering. especially when you have asked them if it was their first time and their answer was yes. lacked in flavor. nothing that made me go YUM or OoOoooo. mcdonald's have better burgers.

*bucket of buffalo wings $13. one of the worst wings i've had as well. tyson frozen buffalo wings are even better than this. this item was not even finished. if you order this ask for a side of buffalo sauce to dip it in. 

observation: 

saw staff standing around talking by the register thing. made me think of resturant stakeout. i wished he would've been recording the staff because that's totally unprofessional.

thoughts:
*love the unique decor. its really cool. 
*service was just poor. i even left a comment on their comment card.
*never coming back! 
*overly priced items.
*presentation wise was decent. 

tips:
*credit card and cash accepted.
*tons of seating area. they just might not have enough staff so they'll make you wait awhile.
*there's a bar area.
*located in the cosmopolitan hotel.",1,0,1

Holsteins is located inside the Cosmopolitan and easy to get to. We were seated within 20 minutes and served almost immediately.

I didn't try their bamBOOZLE shakes (although I plan to next time) but a friend got their regular shake and it was great. 

Each one of us got a different burger and were def not keen on sharing as it was tooooo good to not eat the whole thing. I got the Gold Standard burger with reg fries. It was cooked to a perfect medium and so juicy (that my mouth is watering as I type). The goat cheese and arugula really made it a tasty burger.

My beau got the Nom Nom burger. I'll never forget the way his face lit up when he took that first bite. He said it's one of the best burgers he's ever had. As a fellow burger connoisseur, he must mean business. It was cooked a little well for his taste but man that Kobe beef is bomb diggity. I highly recommend subbing your side for onion rings.

The spiked milkshakes will call out to you, what could be better than liquor in a milkshake, right? To me that just equals to a long night in Vegas, so I moved on.

We went with their Steakhouse burger and to try something I wouldn't expect on their menu we shared a Kalbi Beef quesadilla. The burger was good, not great, with a nice layer of black pepper on the beef, steak sauce, and choice of cheese.

The staff and managers had absolutely no knowledge about food allergies. Our party had two serious food allergies to be concerned with, not just diet choices, but actual allergies. We let our server know ahead of time what those allergies were - gluten\/wheat (for a celiac person) and shellfish. The server said the sweet potato fries were gluten free and not fried in the same oil as anything with fish or shellfish. The calamity of events that happened after this was not only frustrating and annoying, but could have been downright dangerous and life-threatening. Three different servers and two managers told us multiple conflicting things about what menu items contained what, then argued and disagreed with each other in front of us. They had to pull out packages to check what the ingredients were and show us the boxes at the table because nobody had any idea - not even the chef. They had no knowledge of what gluten is. One server argued that all potatoes inherently contain gluten. I told him that is false. He replied that potatoes have starch and anything with starch has gluten. I was shocked. We were told there were separate areas in the kitchen for seafood, and then another server said the same utensils were used for everything. We had already eaten the sweet potato fries when a second server said they had gluten. It turns out, according to the package because they were frozen, they do not. But this was after an initial panic and upset about what that could mean. The first manager was indignant and never once apologized. We were never seeking any consolidations (which they never offered or provided), but rather just for them to know if they are in the restaurant industry they can't have staff making definitive declarations about food allergies if they aren't absolutely sure. There should be training on this for all employees about what menu items contain what allergens. That is a common question for diners and can have serious consequences if someone is uninformed or uneducated. We never received an apology. Only excuses and blame on others. Then we asked to speak to the general manager because the situation was ridiculous. He was drunk. He was actually sitting at the bar drinking and when he spoke to us appeared and smelled visibly drunk. He didn't apologize either, just told us that the situation was noted and that he was busy with other things. The entire experience was shocking and miserable. Never again.

I was going to get the brisket topped Longhorn burger, but I thought I'd go easy and ended up with the Urth Burger and a Arrogant Bastard Ale by Stone Brewing. The milkshakes were definitely as good as the reputation preceded it. We tried the drunken monkey and the Oreo with Irish Cream.

I've heard a few regular Vegas visitors rave about them. So I was on a quest to find out just how special they could possibly be. 

Located inside the new and hip Cosmopolitan, Holstein's contains a bar area as well as a fair amount of table seating. Grabbing a quick lunch before a meeting, I headed towards a bar space where I noticed the server cleaning up after someone who had just left. After I sat down, another server came up to me and said ""Oh no, sir, there's someone sitting there and he'll be right back.""

Looking at the clear space, I asked ""Then why did they just clear all his stuff away?""

Before he could answer, I moved farther down the bar and picked another spot. During the rest of my visit, that ""man"" never came back to his ""spot."" No apologies or anything. So that was a little rude.  

I spied the rolls on the menu and ordered them. When they arrived I knew right away that these were not your average spring rolls. They were quite large. And very good, too. Just picture the best Philly cheese steak you ever had all wrapped up into a perfectly fried spring roll. Then triple that in size. Now you have it. 

They were outstanding and I'll be back again someday for more. They are also very filling, even though they're on the appetizer menu. So you could easily make this a meal. 

This place has a little to learn about customer service, but the food lives up to expectations. And after you're done, step outside to your left and get your shoes shined. It's totally worth it. Just trust me.",2,0,0

I actually got a turkey burger, i think it was called the california turkey burger.  I never eat turkey burgers but it sounded so good.  It was delicious! 

First off, this burger was huge! The bun was so perfect.  It was light, crispy and had a little bit of a sweet taste to it.  Delish! Everything was super fresh! The fries, I could have eaten at least 3 servings of them! The onion rings were super good also.  I wish i would have had a milkshake from there, they all sounded so good! 

My cousin got the El Machete (sp?) burger.  it was cooked perfectly!!!!After seeing that burger and how it was cooked, made me wish i would have gotten a beef burger, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from getting the turkey burger. 

we also had fried pickles which were delicious! The aioli sauce they came with was really good and creamy.  It had a different taste to it.  The pickles were super crispy and the batter was seasoned so well! Some times friend pickles can be super salty, but these ones were perfect and the batter didn't come off of them after you took a bite! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, but delicious place to eat on the strip.",1,0,0

From the creatively named menu items, to the overly fake-eyelashed waitresses, Holsteins really tries to grab your attention.

As for the food and service at this place... Meh. I had ordered the turkey burger and a side salad with dressing on the side. When I started eating my burger, I noticed that there was a small white square on my lettuce. The little white square was an expiration sticker that the chef had forgotten to take-off my lettuce leaf before sending the food out. The waitress was unapologetic, but the manager did come over to say he was sorry. Once the food was re-prepared and delivered to my table, the chef had drenched my salad in dressing. I hate being 'one of those customers', but I had to send my salad back to the kitchen. Again, no apology from the waitress.

The burger itself was just okay. There was nothing to write home about on the flavor of the meat, bun, or side salad. I've had better elsewhere.

While I don't expect my meal to be comped, I did expect something more once I informed the waitress that there was a sticker on my food. Nope, I paid full price for my disappointing meal.

Being a local in Vegas, I have my pick of the litter when it comes to burger joints. Holsteins is a place I don't believe I would visit again.",1,2,2

From the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, Holstein 's is hard to miss. We made it there around 7:30pm on a Saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. When your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. The place is vibrant, loud, and hip. Just like in a NYC subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.
 
Many items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. We ordered the Frozen Grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, crème de menthe, Van Gogh chocolate vodka. If you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. There's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. That distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. We also got the Oreo with Bailey's Irish Cream. This is what I considered a ""safe"" shake to order. If you enjoy Oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. Again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. Warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. I really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.
 
Seems like The Rising Sun $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. Seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? If it was truly an Asian inspired burger, then a fried egg would finish the job. You can add it though for a buck more. I was a little sad that I didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.
 
I ended up with The Steakhouse Burger $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, Holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms, swiss cheese. Oh you fancy huh? Because it sure did sound fancy. Although the burger was good, my mind was set on The Rising Sun as the unanimous winner this night. The pepper was probably what I remember most about this burger. I did finish it but I most likely wouldn't care to order it again.
 
The Maine Lobster Roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. The price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a Mike Tyson uppercut. Why oh why do you tease us like that Holstein 's? Gimme more!
 
The Steak Cut Fries and the Sweet Potato Fries were decent but can be better.
 
Overall, Holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. The meal was quite enjoyable but I'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. I can probably live with or without it. For sure, give it a shot. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. However, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu.

Got the shoestring fries - which were awesome.

Sampled the Holsteins Special Lager - which the waitress said was like ""Bud Light"". Personally, I think that description does it no justice. Nice crisp, lager with a fairly low alcohol content.  Good beer for washing down a heavy meal with a drive home ahead of you.

Located inside of The Cosmopolitan, this is THE place to sip on the greatest boozy milkshake you can find on the strip and probably all of Nevada.

Based on the Yelp reviews talking about how ""HUGE"" the milkshakes are, my mom and I arrived at Holsteins with the intentions of sharing a milkshake for a ""light"" lunch---well, you know... as light as having a milkshake for lunch can be! When our Bailey's infused Oreo milkshake arrived, we both started laughing and ordered another one. Unless you're having a burger and fries with a milkshake, DON'T SHARE. Why?

A) They're not THAAAAT big. 
B) They're too flippin' delicious to share. 

The Oreo milkshake is rich, creamy, and the flavor is about 1600 stories above what you're used to getting from an Oreo milkshake. Even if you get full, you won't want to stop drinking this thing. It's not excessively sweet as some milkshakes can be, so you won't get sick or tired of slurping and sipping the whole thing.

Without planning in advance we ended up here. Didn't have a burger! Instead, had drinks, ""appetizers"" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. The classic martini was terrific, I got the GIN variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which I had never heard (""Nolet Silver""?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (Expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in the bottom of the glass!) Another had a""bloody mary"", which came ""up"", containing pepper\/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! Food was ""fried pickles"" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w\/ herb-caper mayo), ""street tacos"" (crispy shells filled w\/ shreds of duck confit, foie gras, trufle crema & cranberry relish), ""truffle lobster mac n cheese"" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and ""Bull's Balls"" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with ""tomato fondue"" and a slice of lardo). A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The ""Bulls' Balls"" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the ""tomato foudue"", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The ""street tacos"" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the ""fried pickles"" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a ""stout float"" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: ""Johnny Apple Seed"", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what ""hard cider"" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO.

Right out of the gate, things were looking good....we found the place in the Cosmopolitan hotel easily, we were seated without a wait (it was a late Tuesday afternoon), and our waiter looked like Jared Leto. I like Jared Leto. Sweet. 

I decided to go with a Black and White Shake (like Jerry Seinfeld's black and white cookie, but in milkshake form, and it didn't make me puke) and the Rising Sun Burger. If I ever go back to Holstein's, I might have to get the same thing...I loved both. I particularly got into the tempura avocado on the burger. My pal got the Steakhouse Burger and the Birthday Cake shake, which had cake flavored vodka in it. Let me just say this....the person who invented cake flavored vodka deserves some sort of a Nobel Prize, and my friend who decided her life's problems could be washed away with a combination of ice cream and booze deserves some sort of a prize as well....because that's just awesome. And surely explains in part why we have been pals since 1975. Anyway, she enjoyed her burger and shake as much as I enjoyed mine. 

Burgers come with fries....nice that you don't have to order them (and pay for them) separately. We were both disappointed in the fries at BurGR, so the fry test here was paramount....alas, great fries. Big Sigh Of Relief. 

To top it off, Jared Leto was the perfect server and took good care of us. Oh hell, give him a prize, too...maybe an Oscar.

This thing was fully loaded with bacon, arugala, tomato confit, and a garlic sauce. I went a little bit out of bounds and got the RISING SUN BURGER...kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, and a piece of avocado tempura!

Not the best burger I EVER had, but it was super solid and tasty. My only complaint were that the fries and onion rings tasted like generic frozen ones...but they were included with the burger, while most places charge for fries separately.

I'd come back...especially if I'm staying at Cosmo!",3,0,4

Nom Nom Burger ($17.50)
Chips inside a burger just reminds me of my childhood days when I used to do that with french fries. Throw in a fried egg for another dollar or two and this burger is golden. I get my burger medium-rare, and I'm in heaven when I'm devouring the Nom Nom.

Vanilla Milkshake ($9)
A little pricey, but you can share a milkshake with someone else. They give you a glass filled with the milkshake, and they give you the rest in a stainless steel cup, so it's like TWO millshakes. I don't like whip, so it's all milkshake and nothing else for me.

I was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and the burgers here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.

We started with Radicchio Salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  We split a Korean Bullgogi Burger and a Gold Standard Burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between Mary-Kate and Ashley.  The Gold Standard was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  And then the Bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish ""Korean"" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  I would urge anyone to order either of these but all of the burgers looked appetizing on the menu.

My only regret (due to an impending drive back to LA) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.

I explain to her that the sign says they close at 12am, it is 11:55pm, we made it all the way from the Ferris wheel in 10 minutes to buy our 11 year old a $10 vanilla milkshake to go, but she didn't care. She told us again, without looking up from the register, that they are closed.   This place could have sold a vanilla milkshake to an 11 yr old if they wanted, but they didn't want to.  

   The food we had here was good, but obviously overpriced. They just don't care, and that was our experience at this hotel throughout our stay.  It is a pretty hotel, but they just don't care.  There are too many choices in Vegas to get a $15 hamburger without coming to a place that just doesn't care.

The place is so adorable you just want to snap pictures all around the restaurant. The shakes are nothing special...even with alcohol you won't get any sort of buzz. As for the burgers...there is something special in their sauce that makes their burgers extraordinary. 

Billionaire burger: I wanted to try this because of the foie gras which mind you does not cover the whole burger. It is just a couple of bites before it's all gone with over half the burger left. The sauce is good but I don't think the burger is worth the price 

The fries are average  

Lobster Mac n' Cheese: I'd say this dish is poorly executed given that I could not taste the lobster  

The Gold Standard is delicious...if you're going to order a burger that's the one. The flavors meld together perfectly. This is how a burger should be done.

THE BURGER IS HUGE THOUGH. AND AS GOOD AS EVERYONE ELSE SAYS.

We weren't very hungry so we shared the -
Gold Standard Burger - oh lord. Everything about the burger is perfect - savory, seasoned, juicy, HUGE, and perfect bread to filling ratio. The bun itself was good as well. Actually (surprisingly) it could use a little less bacon since I felt like it overtook the 'burger' flavor a bit. Me and the man shared, and we were more than full.
It came with a huge portion of fries as well.

Red Velvet Shake -
Using the words 'red velvet' is usually a hype thing, and I feel like I get disappointed half the time. BUT THIS SHAKE REALLY HAD THE PERFECT RED VELVET FLAVOR! It was $9 (non-alcholic) but the portion is pretty much 2 shakes so it's totally worth it (since they give you the leftover in the metal cup they blend it in - and it's about as much as in the glass cup they serve you!). The macaron on top of the shake was pretty whatever though. It was rich in red velvet flavor, and wasn't too thick or sweet.

Service was on-point, fast and friendly - and constantly checked up on us. You also get this yummy cheesey popcorn as they hand you the menus. Nommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.",0,0,0

I had the steakhouse burger with a fried egg and it was deeeeelish!!! Everyone that had food enjoyed every morsel of their food :)

Lobster mac & cheese was amazing too!!

Some guy came by and gave us liquid nitrogen frozen mints afterwards which was soooo cool!!!

Edit: so we came back the today to have dinner AGAIN because it was so good yesterday. I had the ""rising sun"" burger with jalapeños (per recommendation of waiter Justin) and it was awesome. Considering the size of the burger, it was very light on your palate. The teriyaki sauce adds the perfect touch to the tempura avocado. 

Also, customer service is great. We had Justin as our server twice in a row and he totally remembered us, down to the drinks we ordered last night.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the second floor was packed with people waiting to get in Marquee dayclub. So right away I was put off by the drunk and obnoxious, fist pumpers. Now I know that has nothing to do with the restaurant but I think the commotion rubbed off on our hostess because she had a slight attitude. We were seated fairly quickly, and I was hoping that it wouldn't be so loud inside the restaurant.....I was wrong. It was so loud I truly couldn't talk to people sitting next to me. Frustrating. Onto the food....for starters we ordered the lobster Mac & Cheese, pretty tasty, would order again, perfect amount of flavor and not too salty. Fried pickles, I liked the pickles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the herb-caper mayo, would've been better with ranch. I split the Gold Standard burger, ordered medium well, they actually got the medium well perfect which I appreciate, I couldn't decide if I loved the burger. I don't like meat on meat (i.e bacon on my burger) but the description of the burger sounded delicious, so I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the aioli dressing that threw me off.

I was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. 

We made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. 

Soon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. 

Our burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. 

Another plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! 

A third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!

A fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene.

We tried this place out for the first time last week and am I ever glad we did. It is located DIRECTLY across from the Marquee Beach\/Night Club inside the Cosmopolitan. 

We went for lunch around 230 pm. There was no wait, yet there were tons of patrons.
Before they came out, the server brought out a bucket of popcorn while we waited for our food.
I ordered the Risining Sun $18 with sweet potato fries upgrade exta $2.
My bf ordered El Machete, I believe $16.

Once the food came out it was like heaven on Earth! Such fresh, good qulaity meat and toppings were very delicious as well. 
The bun was super fresh, THEY WERE LITERALLY MADE SAME DAY ( I asked). They definatly helped the burger score some points!

The rising sun had a sweeter taste to it, almost asian sweet. While El Machete had a little more spicer taste. Both were absolutly amazing.

We actually came back a couple other times during our stay in Vegas because it was just that good!

My bf tried the chocolate milkshake which runs about $9. He loved it. Possibly the best milkshake.

The service also scored a 5 star rating, everyone from the host that seats you to the server is well educated on the products and is courtous and well mannored, very prossessional.

Bam Boozled Shakes- Not a huge fan of booze-cream but some of these are pretty spectacular

Birthday cake- yea it pretty much tastes like a birthday cake 

Cereal bowl- captain crunch FTW

Black Cow- even comes with pop rocks on top


Not great
Drunken monkey- sounds great in theory, but in practice is pretty awful

Creme Brule- custard and booze do not mix 

Red Velvet- bleh


Big Buns

Meat ball burger- some purists would probably not like this but it is delicious- it has a tasty focacia bun and pesto on it

Gold Standard- Bacon, Goat cheese, Garlic aoli- this is definitely not for the faint of heart- but those man enough to stare death from heart disease in the face will be rewarded with sensuous delights. 

Rising Sun- tempura avocado. Thats fried avacado. If you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak I don't know what else to say to you.


What to Avoid
Nom Nom- this is pretty meh. Kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment

California Turkey- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this",5,2,3

This place pretty much has only burgers and shakes. I got the original burger and it was very good and very juicy my complaint was not with the food, it was all about the service.  I personally drink a lot of water when I done out like 3-4-5 cups.  I don't know why but I do haha.  Our waiter kept ignoring our table during out ENTIRE MEAL!  He kept on flirting with the bartender the whole time.  I'm a very patient man but this was ridiculous.  If the service wasn't this bad I would have given this place 4 stars easy.

All of their shakes sounded amazing so deciding on just one was not easy.  The wife and I finally agreed on their drunken monkey. As far as shakes go it was delicious, beautiful, and a lot of fun to eat\/drink. I would certainly return to try their other shakes. 
       Now for some friendly advice to potential customers. The shakes are expensive, and ""boozy"" they are not. We were hoping for a closer reflection of the ice cream drinks commonly found in Key West that combined Great flavor with grain alcohols. Which made the prices seem more reasonable and gave the drinks more of a purpose. When you add a shot of hazelnut liqueur to a huge milk shake. Calling it ""boozy"" is very misrepresentative.  I'm sure we would have been able to add more alcohol that would have shot the price of our milkshake well above $20. 
          Sorry for the mixed review, lol. My intentions weren't to confuse you. I think this place is absolutely worth trying. Their food looked and sounded amazing, I simply meant to give people a heads up.",0,2,0

We made a reservation, but we were running a little late so I called and let the restaurant know. When we finally got there, they quickly seated us and got us water. 

Our waitress was super nice, and when she realized it was his birthday she joked around with us and made us feel like we were the most important people there. He got a a blackberry crush cocktail to drink - I stuck to water since I was the DD for the night, haha. To eat, I got the Urth Burger with regular fries, and he got the Rising Sun Burger. Mine was super delicious, and the garlic mayo I got on the side was to DIE FOR. Fiance said his burger was awesome, and ate the entire thing. To finish the meal, we ordered him a cookies and cream bamboozled shake. He really loved it, and the giant cookie on top, but the only bad part was that the cookie came out frozen and even though we let it defrost the entire meal, it was still pretty cold when we went to leave, so he didn't get to really eat it.

Our waitress helped us celebrate by bringing us macaroons in liquid nitrogen. It was so much fun, and so good! I was super appreciative she did that, since not all restaurants on the strip celebrate birthdays. 

Overall, my first impression of Holstein's was super positive. My main issue with it, is that they offer a vegan patty - the burger I got - but their buns have powdered milk in them. For me, powdered milk isn't *too much* of a big deal, but for anyone else it might seem misleading to offer a vegan patty without a vegan bun. The waitress did offer to wrap mine in lettuce instead, but I really wanted the satisfying taste of a patty and a bun.",2,2,1

Holstein's is on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan.  You can't miss the place with all the cartoon cows on the walls.

I walked in with my sister and we sat ourselves at the bar.  The bartender was super sweet and when I told her we were just here for a shake, she recommended their fall special, the Smashing Pumpkin ($15) and I was sold.

It was a sweet blend of vanilla ice cream, Crown Royal maple, salted caramel, pumpkin pie filling and graham crumble.  It tasted exactly like pumpkin pie.  The presentation was also amazing with a mini slice of pumpkin pie on top along with candy corn and an orange lollipop.  

The shake was delicious, but next time I would spring for the extra shot of alcohol for $3 more.  I could taste that there was booze in the shake, but it needed a little more to really be called a boozy shake.

PRO: 
+Amazing burgers.  Try the ""Gold Standard"" burger (aged sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic chive aioli) with a fried egg on top.
+Amazing bam-boozled shakes (with alcohol).  Try the ""Drunken Money"" (Reeses, Banana, Malt, Frangelico) or the ""Red Velvet Cake Shake"" (Zing red velvet vodka, red velvet cake, cream cheese mousse, mini whoopee pie). 
+Beautiful waitresses.  The outfits are completely appropriate, but are reminiscent of Hooters.
+When you're table is ready they'll text you instead of forcing you to carry around a buzzer

-Limited cooking options.  I tried to order my burger medium and I could only get medium well.  Ultimately, it didn't matter because the burger was delicious.

I order medium rare and I end up with a medium done burger and my wife gets the medium rare burger when she wanted medium. Obviously, they don't pay too much attention to the fine details and got the orders swapped.The wedge cut fries did turn out pretty good, but the string cut fries were way too overcooked. 

As a appetizer, we ordered the IPswitch clams and they pretty horrible. The batter was hard and it took some serious chomping just to bite through it. Geez, where these yesterday's leftovers and re-cooked today?

One of the best things is that I received a free draft lager with a Foursquare checkin.

One of the reasons we were there was because of a groupon deal.

Maybe a partition to help with the noise is needed? 
I try not to eat much meat and luckily they offer veggie sliders. They were pretty dry and fell apart so it was difficult to eat them. 
Service was just ok for me. The more busy they became, the less we were checked on.  
Now for the best part- the Shakes! So many to chose from. Be nice and share with your table mates. :) They were so flavorful. Just like the menu described them to be.

Though I was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if I had gone to a buffet, I left wondering how I ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. Oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. But why couldn't I taste the whiskey? Seriously, I'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. That $13 Pumpkin Pie Shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.

Like a studious Yelper, I did my homework and listened to Steph C.'s rec and opted for THE RISING SUN (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado). I've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! The crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that Kobe beef patty delicious. Medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory Terikayi Glaze. For those who don't know, Nori Furikake is a popular Japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. It usually has sesame seeds, dried\/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, MSG. While I can't be sure Holstein's furikake had MSG, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. It was not missing any flavor, and I couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. The fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. It definitely doesn't come close to the best burger I've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. Next time, it might have to be the BIG FAT GREEK (Greek Spiced Lamb With Feta Cream, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion & Olive Relish, W\/Tatziki Sauce) or the BILLIONAIRE BURGER (Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo).

I stayed at the Cosmo last weekend and decided to try this place out with a friend.  
We were seated very quickly even though they said the wait was around 10-15 minutes.  
I ordered the Korean ""bull"" gogi burger and was a little skeptical because it said it had a poached egg, and kimchi in it.  I actually don't like either of those but I thought this weekend was a good time to try something different.  
It turned out DELICIOUS! It was a perfect\/strange combination that REALLY worked!  The spiciness of the kimchi is very mild but hits you at the end.  And the poached egg (I think it was poached?? or maybe it was sunnyside up? I don't know, I don't know eggs very well...lol) just went really well with the burger.  I recommend EVERYONE try that one!  
It came with shoestring fries which was also perfect.

I tried my friends Duck fat fries but I didn't see anything special in them. 
But I also tried her strawberry milkshake and that was SO GOOD! I don't think any other shakes will taste as good as that one.  

My only concern was their service.  When our waitress took our order, we must have waited 45 minutes before we even got our shake... Our waitress even asked us like 30 minutes in if we ordered the shake.  When we said yes, she said it was coming right out.  Liar. 
I was just a little irked because the people who sat next to us, came in AFTER us and got their food BEFORE us! WTF? 

But whatever, the food TOTALLY made up for it. =)

All in all, great place! Just needs to get their service upgraded.

Instead, I prefer crispier, thinner fries. I  wish there had been a second option. But, if you are a fan of soggier fries, you will probably like these.

The service was actually quite good. I was drinking water like crazy, and my glass was always refilled promptly before I could even ask. My only regret is that I did not take the waiter's recommendations, since my meal was somewhat lackluster.

I'd give this place another chance. My bad for trying to opt for something healthier at a burger joint, I suppose.

Because it was that late, service was speedy and attentive. The in-house DJ was a little loud though which made conversations a little tough. I really only needed a snack so I ordered a crispy pork belly slider (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=iFmsSniZf-3AgCH-ZYZakA), or tiny buns as they call them here.

My friend had the carbonara chicken burger (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=VQxHmfVC8yd988No1srqUw) and he thought it was alright. 

They do have a good selection of beers here though. I started with the Tripel Karmeliet from Brouwerij Bosteels on tap and it was a crisp triple with hints of citrus, florals, and ummm banana (to me at least). Next I had a Leffe, also on tap. I thought the Leffe tasted a little off... as though it was slightly diluted but it might have been a result of the Karmeliet before.

The Gold Standard burger was exactly cooked like I requested (medium rare, which often restaurants translate to medium) and was tasty, the fries were just a-ok, nothing special really. We also had onion rings on the side, I thought they were very good: crispy and just the right amount of batter. Next time I will just go for the onion rings instead of fries.

The bam-boozled shakes, which are basically spiked shakes, were very good too. I had a grasshopper shake: the shake itself was yummy and all the toppings took it to the next level.

It's conveniently located inside Cosmo and takes reservations. Our party of 6 was able to call in that morning and have our table ready in 15 mins! Bright and spacious restaurant that can fit a variety of groups.

They offer complimentary butter and vinegar popcorn, (pretty darn good) while you look through their menu. Holstein's is popular for their alcoholic milkshakes, so naturally, we spent longer picking a milkshake than a burger.

My bf and I each ordered their most popular burgers along with the Campfire Smores milkshake to share.

The Rising Sun ($18) -- Kobe beef covered in a teriyaki glaze with tempura avocado. I enjoyed the first few bites but was over the glaze, I don't usually prefer sweet sauces. Fairly large sized burger that will certainly make you feel guilty.

Gold Standard ($18.50) -- This dry aged beef sirloin burger is similar to others you will find, with bacon, arugula, and garlic-chive aoili. We both enjoyed this more and agreed you can't go wrong with it. Their natural cut fries are also better than the sweet potato fries, which are nothing special.

Campfire Smores Milkshake ($13) -- They have a great selection of milkshakes and it was really hard to choose! The waiter recommended this and you can't really go wrong with graham cracker crumbles. Very tasty and sweet but you couldn't taste any of the Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka. Presentation was also nice with the toasted marshmallow.

Out of the two burger joints we tried this weekend, we prefer BurGR more. This was the most I have ever paid for a burger and have had better. If I come back, it would have to be for a milkshake, I don't think I can throw down $15+ for another burger.",2,0,1

I tried their sister burger place (LBS in the Red Rock Casino) and that was a pretty solid burger.  I came here with only the intention of critiquing their burger.  I was thinking of getting the billionaire burger since foie gras is now illegal in Cali, but couldn't bring myself to fork out $30 for a burger.

I was going to go with the nom nom burger, but my waiter sold me on the Gold Standard which he said was voted the best burger in Las Vegas.  How could I not try it now?  It came out pretty fast.  It did not look messy and presentation was done well.

The burger itself was above average and I give it a solid 4 stars.  However, I disagree that it is the best burger in Las Vegas and definitely disagree with the $17 price tag.  So if you're curious, to try, you will be getting a good tasting high quality burger, but you're going to pay for it.  I liked it, but I think it's a one and done for me.

Holstein's was a great find last night, after countless hours of scouring the Yelp site for something other than sushi.  I was ready for a change, for a new spot to grab a burger, and when I saw the reviews for Holsteins and it's location, I had to give it a try.  

Let me start by saying that the Cosmo itself is beautiful, and this place makes it even better with a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar.  

I made reservations through their website (highly recommended) for dinner at 9pm.  Late?-Sure, but it prevents us from eating with the regular dinner crowd.  We arrived and were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us immediately a corner half booth.

The ambiance is really comforting and chic, which I love.  With the chocolate leather seating to the bright colored tiles aligning one wall and picture-framed tv's, it's metrosexual.  The menu is interesting, too, boasting unique sodas, shakes, and burgers.  Obviously, the menu was in the higher dollar range for a burger considering it is in the Cosmo, but I went all out and ordered what I wanted.  

I ordered their newest shake--the cereal bowl--which tasted like breakfast in the morning but in a really fantastic way.  With vanilla ice cream mixed with crushed Cap'n Crunch and Fruity Pebble cereal, it was quite a treat to have, almost like dessert before dinner.  I LOVE IT.  I'm a big cereal person, so this was perfect for me (and it was suggested by the server).

Frank picked up this crazy strawberry soda that was really really good.  I'm going to try and find it at the soda shop on Trop and the 215.

We had the philly spring rolls with tempura pepper slices and ketchup.  It was freakin' great.  The flavors and textures were all on point.  When you combine a philly with a spring roll, magic happens.  Squishy, creamy, gooey cheese oozes out of the end and the ketchup makes it all the better.

We ordered their kettle chips, which had this great bleu cheese salt on them, and the french dip was awesome, too.  Unfortunately, the spring rolls trumped the chips, but they would go great with a beer at the bar, for sure.

I ordered the Rising Sun burger: Kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, crispy yam strings, teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo.  Wow. Just the right amount of sauce and the yams gave it this nice, sweet, spicy flavor and texture.  The meat itself was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  With that soft, white bun that didn't overpower the meal (it was really light), I believe that I found my favorite burger in Vegas.

Frank ordered the Gold Standard: aged beef patty with guyere (substituted for the aged goat cheese), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  He added lobster, which made it decadent and very flavorful. The sweetness of the lobster accentuated the patty's aged flavor.  It's a winner, for sure.

With no room for dessert, we tapped out with an 81.00 bill, which was expected.  I would definitely eat here again. And again. And again.

Both burgers were huge! I really liked my burger, I wasn't too sure about the fried egg on a burger but that shit was amazing! The yolk cracked and the bun soaked it all up and it was delicious :) and the you can't go wrong with bacon - it was the perfect breakfast\/lunch\/hangover burger ever! The boyfriend wasn't fond of his though - he said that brisket that came on top was really fatty and the brisket was the reason he ordered the burger.

I was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem, that's not unusual. By the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. We were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. Because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. They attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. We quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. 

Lobster corn dogs: good, but not great 
Fried pickles: extremely tasty! 
Lobster mac n cheese: I only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! 
Philly steak egg rolls (I think): ehhh 

So far so good...I was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! I kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. I can't complain. I had it with steak fries which were also good. The overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. 

So why the 2 stars? While the food was good, maybe even great, the service was TERRIBLE. Wait, I have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. While Pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, Nicole's side of the table had several problems... 

1. the birthday girl ordered a classic burger with Cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, wild mushrooms and NO TOMATOES. What she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. While I acknowledge this was not Nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! And throughout the whole time Nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. 

2. Someone else ordered a burger (I honestly can't remember which one) with brie and grilled onions. When she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for Cheddar instead. This also took a ridiculous amount of time. 

3. Someone ordered a beer that never came 

During this time another one of our party decided to say something to the Manager, Steve. As soon as we said something to him, he brought the burgers out. He was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. The second burger was supposed to have grilled onions and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let Steve now, he immediately said ""Oh no, there are grilled onions on there, I saw them put them on"" Then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on the burger. Obviously Steve was left a little red in the face. To his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. The birthday girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. 

The duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. 

Oh and the server (who's name I didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then ""tying his shoes"" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  We know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.

What is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.",2,1,2

I like the decor with the weird art and they also have a bunch of growlers on display which they sale too. It's a lot smaller inside then I thought and for some reason, I thought the seats were super uncomfortable. 

Anyway, I went with the Rising Sun and my wife went with an Urth burger substituted with beef instead of a veggie patty. That's one cool thing...they will let you do pretty much anything you want with the burgers, mix & match or whatever. The burger itself is juicy but pretty plain in flavor. Both burgers had a good amount of toppings but since the meat is so plain, it's all you can taste. My burger did have a tempura avocado on it though and that on it's own was killer!

For the price, I really expected more. They up-charge $2 to swap your fries for onion rings or sweet potato fries and neither of those were worth that. We also got a Drunken Monkey shake that seems to be really popular...it was ok but $11 is crazy especially since we ordered it ""virgin"".

Holsteins is fantastic. I read that they specifically created the restaurant for the Cosmopolitan, which I'm assuming is true because they both have a very cool, similar vibe.

My only complaint (and not even that) was that there are flat screens everywhere showing football games. My boyfriend was glued to the screen, which was great for him, but made me slightly annoyed since I don't care for sports. 

There are also endless options for how you want your burger. Being a cheese snob, I had to go with the stinkiest ones possible - it takes burgers to the next level.

we wait for her to come back to get our card and she disappears AGAIN. finally some random employee comes and grabs our check and we leave... we literally ate in like 20 minutes and waited 45min-1hour just to pay and leave.

esp its located in my fav hotel! cosmo!
i tried the drunken monkey shake and it was soooo good!!
even though i could barely taste the alcohol in it.
as for the burger i tried the golden standard, and was mildly disappointed.
the burger was decent but it wasn't really warm when it came out.
compared to the other burgers i had...it wasn't as flavorful as i hope it'd be.
the sweet potato fries that came with it wasn't warm as well. 
the girl that served us wasn't as attentive as she should be.
even forgot to give us our check and kept on saying:"" you're lying!"" lol...
i was kinda speechless hahahaha. i dont think i'll go back considered the food also took forever when the restaurant wasn't even busy at all.",1,1,1

We ordered a Spark and Oreo Milkshake to go with our burgers.  Burgers were cooked perfectly and were outstanding.  The Sparks were so good we had three.

Went back to Holsteins a couple of days later for dessert.  Lollipops were to die for. The Strawberry Shortcake Slider & Fries were just okay.

Third visit to Holsteins on the last day.  Ordered two Sparks this time.  The waitress asked how they were and we said they didn't taste as good as the ones on the first day.  She said it might be a different bartender but took our drinks back.  We were surprised when she came back and said that we were right and the bartender realized he had forgotten the agave nectar and was remaking our drinks.  Second try was better but definitely a different bartender makes a difference!

We didn't realize how much time had passed until the manager came up to our table and said, ""I'm sorry you are waiting so long for your food. We lost your ticket.  I'm sending over some Artichoke Guac so you don't starve.""  He offered us two more complimentary cocktails but we said we were good with the water.

They didn't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays but we were heading over for an early dinner anyways, so we beat the crowds easy.

I did think it odd, however, that they placed us right beside a rather rowdy table in a basically otherwise empty room, particularly since we had a young child in our party.  While the adults selected a couple of burgers to share and one of their intoxicating BAM-BOOZLED SHAKES, the Drunken Monkey $13 Reese's, Banana, Malt, Frangelico, the toddler got the Mac & Cheese $9 off the kiddie menu, which comes with a mini vanilla ice cream sundae.

The Mac & Cheese was appetizer sized and consisted of a pool of a strongly cheesey sauce with some noodles swimming in it.  The sundae, however, had two scoops of vanilla bean flecked ice cream topped with whipped cream and a scattering of candies.

The burgers were not particularly oversized, though they were on the tall side.  While I somewhat preferred the The Rising Sun $18 Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado with its sweet sauce, my DC preferred the saltier Gold Standard $18.50 Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli.  We upgraded one of the accompanying fries to sweet potato for $2, which I enjoyed a lot more than their relatively wimpy plain potato cousins.

Well, maybe not just ""cute"" - it is also very well designed, spacious, and modern in addition to having a cute little cow as its mascot. But we don't go to places because they're cute, we go for the food, right? My boyfriend and I both ordered the ahi tuna sliders with the fries on the side, and he loved them. I did not like the sliders. They were creatively prepared and looked delicious, however, something about the tuna was off-putting for me. That is just me, though - he gives them rave reviews. Seeing that I had enjoyed a (huge) burger at a different restaurant in Vegas our first night, and ended up at Holstein's because our first choice had a much longer wait, I figured that ahi tuna sliders would give me enough variety and not make me feel like ""ugh, burgers again?"". Enough about my slight dislike of the sliders, though. The fries were amazing, and so was the chili mayo that they came with! Mmmmmmm....such a good combination, just the right mix of sweet and spicy (for the mayo).

I also tried the Fun-ghi, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  The flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  The burgers come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  I recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.

Complimentary popcorn in a bucket really hit the spot! This popcorn had a salty and tangy seasoning similar to corn nuts, ranch flavor. 

Ahi poke tostadas starter consisted of perfect bite sized portions of poke over 6 round corn tortilla chips. Reminded me of tuna tartare. Would recommend this for anyone that is looking for a light healthier option.

I came here for my 23rd birthday with some friends. They definitely need to organize their waiting lines better though.

I waited for 15 min behind these people, thinking it was a line, but no, they were just crowding and didn't bother to say anything though they all saw us standing there. 

Anyway, food was great! I ordered the gold standard burger and the birthday cake bamboozle shake. I'm not a big fan of bacon on my burgers, but damn, that burger was \/amazing\/. It was juicy and cooked to by perfection. The buns were soft, warm, and buttered generously. My friend ordered The Rising Sun. He doesn't even like burgers much (and came for the alcoholic shakes haha), but he just ate everything and proclaimed it all delicious. 

The shake actually tasted like birthday cake and gave me a mild buzz. They also give you the shaker it was made in, so it's pretty much two shakes for the price of one. Friends ordered maple bacon shake and smores shake. The maple bacon had pieces of chocolate-covered bacon in it, which was strangely delicious. Smores tasted exactly like smores.

In contrast to the sharp trendiness of the Cosmopolitan Hotel itself is Holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word ""indulgence."" 

Our wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a Monday lunchtime visit - so I wouldn't be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.

According to the restaurant's website, Holsteins no longer offers its Crispy Calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. The calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. The Tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. I hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that I've had in recent memory!

For our burger selection, we shared a ""Fun-Ghi"" Burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. Indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave the burger an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. The patty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.

We also split an order of Truffle Lobster Mac-N-Cheese (might as well go all in if you're indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). In contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn't overly rich or oily. Its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented the burger quite well. 

In sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and I were pretty much stuffed. The portion sizes were bigger than what we're accustomed to getting for the price (cough, Umami, cough). This being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is Sin City after all.

We didn't get a chance to try any of the famed Holstein's ""adult"" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. In particular, the ""Red Velvet Cake Shake"" really jumps off of the page!

**the steakhouse burger- Beef Patty Crusted With Black Pepper, Holsteins Creamy Steak Sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, Wild Mushrooms, Swiss Cheese. When they say ""crusted with black pepper"" they were not kidding. this ""black pepper"" was like crushed pepper corn covering every inch of the cheese slice. you must love black pepper to be able to enjoy this burger. it was quit yummy

**the fun-ghi- Beef Patty, Roasted Portabello, Carmelized Onion, Truffle Oil, Gruyere, Frisee, Aioli. nothing special to note about this burger. you could smell the fragrance of the truffle oil which i love, but the flavor wasn't strong. i love black pepper so i liked the steakhouse burger better and it seemed more juicy.

of note. they don't take reservations on the weekend. but the plus side is that when you put your name down they will text\/call you when your table is ready and give you about 10 minutes to respond before they give it away.

i've been here two times and both times the food didn't live up to the hype. the burgers are quite expensive. coming out to around ~$23 per person with tax and tip for just the burger entree, nothing extra, no drinks etc. that is QUITE expensive for a burger and fries in my book. and this isn't anything fancy. to my knowledge (i could be wrong) its not grass fed organic meat or anything. i probably won't be back due to the cost but might stop by to try a milkshake.",1,0,0

We decided to walk in because it was just before lunch time and figured it would be easy to get a table. Place was pretty empty when we got there, but the hostess gave us the impression that we were somewhat intruding. The interior design of the restaurant quickly helped get past the awkward arrival. In terms of food, as the title suggests you have a pretty large variety of burgers, shakes and beer - make sure you try their signature lager, I loved it. A really nice touch was that we received a small complimentary bucket of popcorn.

As a starter we went with the Poutine. Canadians would have lost their mind (in case you don't know, they are defensive of this dish): thinly cut fries and crunchy all the way, gravy on the side & some tasteless shredded short rib. I don't mind the gravy on the side bit but I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known I would be getting regular fries with cheese and some poorly seasoned meat on top.

For the main dish I decided to go with the signature Gold Standard and my wife went with The Classic. We asked both the burgers to be medium but we were in for a surprise. In a city like Vegas you can't ask a person how they would like their meat to be cooked and then get it wrong. My burger was medium-well (emphasis on the well) which I can accept. But the fact that my wife's one was rare all the way I can't. I'm surprised she didn't want to send it back. I cannot complain about the overall taste of the burger - the bacon and smoked goat cheddar really bring it to the Gold Standard.

There was another small incident that bugged me. The waiter that was responsible for collecting empty glassware was a bit over zealous. He first came to our table and reached for the popcorn bucket which was still half full and my wife was still enjoying it. He did ask if he could take it but with the hand already onto it. Because of the noise he understood that we were ok with him taking it. That really wasn't a problem because it can happen to any of us, but what came next really annoyed me. I still had 2 fingers worth of beer in my glass and in a slight moment in which I wasn't paying attention he came again and took the glass without asking. By the time I realized that he had taken it he was already too far. I found this to be impolite and unprofessional. The devil is in the details guys and unfortunately I was expecting both the food and the quality of service to excel.

I'm not trying to discourage anyone from having a meal here. The interior design is really nice and the food was tasty. It's just the small details I outlined which shaved off 2 stars off my review.

Had I not had my heart set on a burger, I would have turned on my heal and gone next door (who had a friendly greeting just viewing the menu).  I overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  These girls had a ""what are you doing here?"" attitude. I imagine one of them answering the phone: ""Holsteins, you're welcome.""  Perhaps Smiling 101 could be a start?

That being said:  Server (Kyle) recommended the Rising Sun burger and it was THE best burger I've had EVER.  Tempura avocado, nori furikaki, crispy sweet potatoes...give me one right this second.  Service was cool, friendly, and professional.  Nicely done.

Atmosphere was fun and lively, but the stupid bass from the DJ was literally vibrating the booth I was sitting in.  Let's go for quality over quantity here, Holsteins.

The prices are what you'd expect for a hotel restaurant on the strip, burgers around $15-$20. I was blown away by my burger, the Gold Standard, which had aged everything, including dry aged sirloin beef, aged goat cheese and bacon. The subtle flavors of the tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aoili all shone through to compliment this. These guys also cooked my burger truly medium rare, exactly as I wanted it cooked. The fries were hot and crispy. No complaints whatsoever on the food. My buddy had the Captain Hook, a salmon filet with smoked salmon on top and other savory flavors. He loved it, and the sweet potato fries were also crispy. 

Holsteins gets points off for a couple things, both beer-related. We had a waiter in training. With of our waiters were friendly and kind. However, the experienced server didn't know any of the beers on their rotating tap list (6 breweries) and didn't offer to find out when I questioned her. Instead, she pointed to their standard tappers and directed me to a dark beer, my stated preference. If you're going to feature something like 40 different bottled beers, you should know what's on tap, too. This goes double if you're training someone. I ended up ordering a Left Hand Porter which came to me warm. Like room temp warm. I know this is how it's served abroad, but even the bottle says ""keep refrigerated"". I didn't say anything since we needed to get back to our conference.

I'd say Holsteins gets 4 stars if their staff can stay on top of their beer selection and service. Eat the grub! I might give them another try soon for a boozy shake.",1,0,1

So i ordered a bull's balls (fried risotto balls), holstein sliders, and duck duck goose burger with duck fat fries. 

The risotto balls stuffed with veal was delicious but could have had creamier risotto on the inside. The lardo on top was amazing but lardo tastes good no matter what. Theres no skill involved to make pig fat taste good.

holstein sliders were okay sliders but i've had better.

My DUck duck goose burger was a huge disappointment. Its a beef patty stuffed with duck and foie gras sounds awesome right?! and i ordered it medium rare.

The food is just ok. I guess I was expecting an amazing hamburger and it was just very regular. I didn't enjoy the bun at all and felt the toppings were a bit lacking. I ordered the ""Bull-gogi Burger"" and was expecting a flavor explosion, but it just wasn't. Just a little blander than I was expecting. Still a pretty tasty burger cooked well, but nothing I'm dying to go back and try again. My black cow alcoholic float was pretty good, but honestly I think I would have preferred it without alcohol. The fries were so-so. I got the steak fries, but they were really more like wedges and I wasn't really a fan of the seasoning. I tried my fella's skinny fries and preferred them. 

It was my friend Ryan B's birthday, so we received a free round of jell-o shots and a plethora of outrageous desserts that none of us had room to eat. I tried the carrot cake and the funnel cake and they left a lot to be desired. They just didn't pack the punch I had been hoping. There were interesting, but if you're going to be interesting at least try to make them tasty. The carrot cake was shaped like a carrot and was a super cute concept albeit somewhat phallic. It was paired with carrot ice cream, but I really wasn't feeling it. The funnel cakes were topped with ground up cereal, but I would have preferred a fruit or creamy topping.

The restaurant was located a few steps from the elevators which also provided a visual reminder for us every time we passed it.

Our party started off lunch with some spicy Bloody Mary's.  They were actually a little WAY too spicy it felt like you drank some fire - the heat crazy lingered.  They also have a pretty amazing beer selection. The server cracked me up when I asked him for an IPA suggestion - this guy said their Sierra Nevada ""Holiday Blend"" was what he'd recommend.  Uhmmmm....So I went with the Green Flash IPA instead.  I also had a taste of the Tenaya Creek Hop Ride IPA - both VERY tasty ales.  MmmHmmm.  The server also brought out some Salt and vinegar popcorn for us to munch on. I haven't ever had these and gobbled them up to say the least.  

I didn't eat any burgers this time around but had their Crispy Pork Belly Buns.  These were tasty and hit the spot.  Other members of our party had burgers though: the Big Fat Greek for one.  It was big AND fat - looked tasty too. If only I ate lamb *sigh*

Definitely coming back to check out their burgers - prob settle for a turkey burger.  The service was good and prices adequate for a Vegas restaurant.

I got the chocolate malt milkshake and it was heavenly. Two people can share one as it makes two large milkshakes for the amount that they give you. So why three stars? Unlike my friends, who had their sirloin beef burgers with bacon and cheese that were apparently out of this world, I ordered the big fat Greek Lamb burger, as it is called. It was terrible! Seriously gross. I love Greek food and I love lamb, but this just wasn't right. The sour cream and yogurt and the lamb Patty that they put together just did not work. There was an odd taste to it that was just foul. I am really disappointed by this because a burger joint should be phenomenal and any burger that it offers. This burger would disappear from the menu if I had my way.
The ambience is very nice and the service is very friendly. Realize that it is not cheap. It is not overly expensive either, but for two burgers and two milkshakes, the price came out to about $60. There was no alcohol involved in this price.

Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef\/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!  

Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..

No idea. Those tables were still empty when we left the restaurant after our meal an hour later, so maybe they're reserving them for the POTUS. Yeah right.

Let's get down to the real stuff:
- Milkshakes are gooood. The oreo one especially hit the spot as a nice malt\/bailey's shake. Noted that it wasn't as alcoholic as Black Cow or Brown Cow.
- Burgers... oh burgers - where do I even begin? Should I start with the fact that I had to send the burger back because it was well done, dry and gritty instead of medium-rare and juicy? The replacement was barely better (came medium-well) but at that point I was so disappointed that a burger place can't get the temperature right that I ate it as sustenance rather than something to be enjoyed and savored.

I originally wanted to check out Holstein's after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!

Although some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean ""Bull""gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ).

The patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.

All things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than ""shoestring"").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.

The burgers here we A-OK. The patty itself was fairly pitiful and not very flavorful. I got their signature  burger that has been on a bunch of shows, etc. It was good, not mind blowing, but just good. I would definitely say not worth $18.50. But it is a hotel in vegas so I get it. The toppings were all good but was really where the flavor lived. The bun was good. The fries were very good, I'll give them that.

My wife got the burger with the avocado and jalapenos. It too was just AOK, good and serviceable but not an outstanding burger. 

The service was outstanding, I will definitely give them that. They have a decent beer selection too. If you use your help app you get a free 12oz. house beer. It wasn't bad at all, tasted like a cross between bud light and stella (yeah weird mix I know, but that's what it is). And it certainly was the right price.

I may come back, but I may try another place first.",2,0,0

My kids were happy but at the end I was wanting more.  When you are first seated you are given a bucket of popcorn.  The seasoning on it was amazing, full of flavor.  The corn they delivered us that night was a little on the burnt side.  

The meal arrived and while the burger was good, the fries were just ordinary.  I know you can upgrade your fries, I would suggest this if you go.  I ordered the Gold Standard, no complaints, but I have had better.    My kids ordered the chicken fingers and mini burgers off of the kids menu.  They were all overcooked, chicken fingers were burnt on the ends, hard and dark brown.  Mimi burger was too over done for my 6 year old.  

The most amazing part of the meal was the shake which is the only reason this restaurant got three stars instead of two.  We ordered the S'mores shake without alcohol.  The marshmallow on top of the shake was worth the trip alone.  The whipped cream on the shake was equally amazing. 

If you were anywhere except Las Vegas this would be way too expensive a meal for a hamburger and shake.  However, the high cost is just paying the rent at the trendy Cosmopolitan Hotel.

I would most definitely go back for a shake, but would pass on the rest of the meal.",0,0,0

I added a fried egg and I was happy about that. I ordered a caipirinha since they had a full bar and I was happy about that too.

They have booths and tables, but also a bar seating area to the left side of the restaurant. Reservations can be made through OpenTable.

Thursday night after our third day of CES we were famished and irritated how the day was ending so far. BTW, never go to HTC's promotional booth that isn't at the convention center. Horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place out for years and never got around to it. This trip I was determined that we were going and what a better way to end a pretty bad day than a nice juicy burger and a good shake?

Our Order:
++Truffle Mac & Cheese: ($16.50) Tellegio-Marscapone sauce w\/ Maine Lobster and Black Truffle
++Gold Standard: ($18.50) Sirloin Burger w\/ smoked bacon, Tomato Confit, Goat Cheddar Cheese, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli 
Add Fried Egg (+$1)
++Billionaire Burger: ($32) Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisse, Truffle Mayo
Add Lobster (+$10)
Add Sweet Potato Fries (+$2)
++Drunken Monkey: ($13) Reese's, Banana, Malt, Frangelico

Complimentary pizza popcorn came out in a little milk pail while we waited for our food to arrive. They change the flavor periodically but there's no schedule as to when it's changed. We inhaled the popcorn as we hadn't really eaten anything all day.

I've had the Rossini Burger at the Burger Bar (the $65 burger) and the Billionaire Burger isn't as juicy with a thinner patty. The Billionaire Burger also doesn't have the chunks of truffles that I liked. The truffle flavor is only in the truffle mayo. There was a nice chunk of foie gras but there was hardly any lobster on the burger. Kind of disappointing since you're paying $10 to add lobster. =\/ My friend absolutely loved his burger. He had actually ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese to add to his burger. He kept moaning with every bite he took of his burger. I'm not a fan of mac & cheese but I tried a bit anyways. The pasta was soft and there was plenty of gooey cheese. There were bits of something (possibly breadcrumbs) sprinkled on top that gave it a good texture contrast. There was more lobster in the Truffle Mac & Cheese than what was added on to my burger.

The Drunken Monkey wasn't too overly sweet and had real chunks of bananas. A bit lighter on the Reese's flavor though which was OK but I love chocolate and peanut butter and would've liked more. Couldn't taste the alcohol in it at all (which I prefer) but also pretty dangerous if you drink it too fast.

At the end of our meal our server brought out frozen mint meringues! They were in a tin milk pail and we just picked it up with our fingers from a spoon that scooped the meringues out. It was so amusing eating them because every time you breathed out, water vapors came out of your mouth that made it look like smoke.

Our server, Warren was amazing!! We vented about how bad our day was and he helped end our night on a great note. One point, we saw him & his co-worker dancing and rapping at the POS machine having a blast. He saw us watching and just commented, ""I love working here."" You could definitely tell that he did. :) We spoke with the manager about how he did a great job and found out that it was his first week as a waiter as a promotion from being a table server. They're definitely lucky to have him.

Overall, the food would be a 4 star but because of the service, I had to bump it up a star. Definitely would be coming back.",1,1,1

For $20 per burger, I expect it to be different somehow, but it was really just like going to Red Robin but paying twice as much for the same flavor and quality.  Using fancy ingredients only matters if it actually makes the burger taste better!  We got the Gold Standard, and the Fun-Ghi.  Both were tasty, but again not any better than an $8 burger from Red Robin, and not anywhere close to being as juicy and delicious as a $4 In N Out double double.  The fries were very average, but the onion rings were fresh and outstanding.  $6 for an orange cream soda that I can get for $1 at the grocery store is a little ridiculous too.  And after realizing how overpriced the burgers were, we decided to not pay $15 for an overpriced milkshake, and went to Sonic Drive Thru for a $2 half price happy hour milkshake which was probably just as good or better.  Overall, I would not ever eat here again, simply because I can get a burger that tastes just as good at half the price at Red Robin, in an atmosphere that is very similar.

February 2, 2016
 
Dear Sir\/Madam,
I am writing today to complain about the inexcusable treatment I received on Tuesday, January 19th at your Las Vegas location.
 
I entered the restaurant at about 8:30pm as I was meeting with friends who had already been seated and ordered for me.
When I arrived, I knew where my table was and I walked past the hostess who at no time stopped me, and a busser clearing a table, asked if my dog was a Service animal, to which I said yes and at not being questioned further made it to my table and sat.
 
As my meal was already waiting for me, I began to dine and I had not yet taken my second bite when the manager came over and asked me if I had Identification for my animal?
 
As per ADA Law: http:\/\/www.ada.gov\/service_animals_2010.htm
* When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed.
o Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform.
o Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.
 
 
I was then asked to provide any form of ID to show he was a service dog. I obliged the manager and provided his certification although I had already stated I did not need to.
Upon him seeing it, he said he needed an ASPCA card and some other form of ID. I explained that neither of them are covered by ADA and he then stated that His establishment (Holstein's) didn't recognize dogs for ""Stress Disorders.""
 
At this point, I had become highly agitated, not to mention embarrassed by the continuing debate and had some choice words with him about sacrifice and losing friends.
He had to step away for a moment and I took that moment to apologize to a couple at the table next to us and they felt I was in the right. Their daughter has a service animal as well and knew the rigors I was going through.  
 
The manager then returned with an email he was basing his reasons for having me leave the restaurant.  In trying to placate me he made mention that his father was in Vietnam and supports vets. Yet still I was being kicked out and had not in fact, broken any laws.
* A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless:
o (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it
or  

o (2) The dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal's presence.
* Establishments that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.
 
I left your establishment quite appalled and publically embarrassed, as were my friends. I apologized to the manager for yelling at him after my dog calmed me down and kept me from becoming too excited.
 
I trust this is not the way that Holstein's Shakes & Buns, wishes to conduct business with valued customers.  As a veteran, I have never encountered such treatment before.
 
I ask that you understand that service dogs are a protected entity and that your manager needs to recognize that as such. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn of how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.

The DJ was playing hot music and everyone was vibing and having a great time!  Me and my crew ate some yummy apps and had some good drinks.  I loved the philly egg rolls and the steak quesadillas with kimchi.  Our sever Britney was really cool.  She got us our food and drinks quickly and she had a great personality.  Some badly dressed, married dude wandered up to me and my girls and bought us a round of Patrone shots!  Nice!!  This spot was ideal for people watching as it was right next to the line for Marquee nightclub.  The line was packed and watching wasted, scantily clad people is very entertaining.",0,0,0

There were two concerts that night, plus the fact is was Saturday made it very crowded. The 20 minute wait wasn't a problem. The fact that the pager went off to tell us that they were ready to seat us when they weren't was the problem. We had to wait another 10 minutes.  

Be warned that the music is VERY LOUD. You have to yell at everyone which gets old. I'm use to loud music in a club but not when I'm eating.  The redeeming qualities of the music are that the bass is low so you can't feel it in your chest and the mix is arranged nicely.

The milkshakes are really tasty. They range from $11-14. You get two drinks for that price since you also get a completely filled shake container. My boyfriend liked his Korean Bull Gogi burger. I got the chicken and waffle appetizer. It wasn't anything special about it. I like that they gave us a small bucket of popcorn while waiting for our food. It didn't seem to take too long for the food to come out but they gave us popcorn anyway. 

A little annoyance for me that has nothing to do with the stars was the tie wearing. The waiters are suppose to wear ties, but they have to stick them in their shirts so they don't flop around. It looks weird, like they're wearing ascots. I think the restaurant should either give them shorter ties or supply tie clips.  

I would go back here for the milkshakes, just the milkshakes.",1,0,0

They give you spiced popcorn instead of bread with the meal; I got refills both times I went since it was so tasty! 

I highly recommend the shakes.  I had the Nutella crunch shake and it was amazing. Super thick and chocolaty, and the crunchy bits made it even more memorable.  You can add extra shots of alcohol too ;)  Although the shakes are pricey, they give you a large glass for the shake, plus the extras.  The first time I got the shake the extras were almost enough to refill the entire glass again!  Although the burgers are good, it's the shakes that made me want to go out of my way to go back to Holstein's.   

Thanks to my fellow yelpers, I decided to try the lobster mac & cheese.  It's a small portion, but since it is so rich I would not have wanted any more.  It's worth trying if you're a fan of lobster, mac & cheese, and truffle.  However, it wasn't amazing so you're not missing out if you give it a pass.

The burgers are good as well.  Again, I thought they were overpriced but it was very enjoyable.  The black pepper crusted burger was very peppery and the bold flavors were unique.  I think the choice of burgers comes down to a personal preference.

In the world of gourmet burgers whether on the strip or venture outside no shortage of quality spots get your burger on...Most part hit all of them exception of Umami or Guy Fieri. The thing that stood out the most for me is the atmosphere at Holsteins Shakes and Buns. It just screams good vibes, family atmosphere (between pasture and pastures of cows everywhere you look) cartoon characters interior decor, and far cry from all the other restaurants in the Cosmo. The prices are reasonable price or should say same like most of the other ""gourmet"" burger places $12-15. They do have the over the top foi gras burgers that not reasonable price. 

I came to Holsteins for recovery Volunteer meal after working the RnR Marathon with family. After seeing over 40,000 runners working hard that makes anyone hungry. Thankfully we had reservations cause anything on the strip on RnR day is madhouse. Just made even more impression that the service we had was awesome. The restaurant literally had no empty tables. Yet out waiter was very much on it! He did great job explaining the menu for couple first timers like me. Very attentive once we got our food making sure our glass never empty and checking see if everything was good. We even split the bill with different credit cards but never complain and still had smile at the end of the night.

I ordered the Steakhouse Burger. It was really good. I was leaning towards some of the main stay popular choices. The more keep looking at the Steakhouse Burger not get off it. Their steak house sauce combine with tomato confit, cheese, and more just working out in my head delicious. I got my burger first impression was looks like DAM good burger. Sorry about no picture. I was starving going full volunteer shift my choice no break. It was the perfect recovery meal. The size is nice. It not tiny nor over the top huge burger. All the burgers comes with choice of side. Free side that worth star by itself considering most of the other gourmet burgers spots just paying for the burger. The burger was cooked perfect medium just liked I ordered. The flavors was the perfect combination. Think of it as pepper crusted steak with creamy A1 sauce. Ok. It might not be doing it justice but just giving you idea. 

If not in the mood for burgers they got you covered from Salmon Burger (looking good also), veggie burger, or turkey burger. The shakes got to see the birthday cake (think that was it). I passed on the shakes. Talk about list! Am sure if shake fan they got you covered.

So when we arrived at Cosmo, we headed up to Holsteins on the 2nd floor on a Sunday evening and walked to the hostess desk at check in. 

From the get go I already had a predetermination that we weren't going to get the friendliest girls to check in with. I figure, put your tasks aside, and greet your f'in customer. At least acknowledge them immediately. Ok, so maybe it was that bad- she took my name, gave me the pager, and told me it will be just a few with a semi-courteous attitude. So we walked around out front a bit, I went over to the bar across the way and picked up a brew, went back to have a seat outside the restaurant. Then I noticed my pager was chirping. This wasn't the typical light up and vibrate situation we're all used to when they are paging us to check in. This was an intermittent chirp, no lights, as if it was possibly telling me the battery was running low. I don't know! So I got up, stopped inside to inquire about, or let the hostess know (she was the same one who helped me just like seven minutes prior) the pager, and she acted like if I was freshly coming in for the first time. (mind you I had the pager held up to the hostess desk... And my beer in my other hand) The first words out of her mouth, so directly were, ""I'm sorry! No outside drinks in here"". That tripped me out and I told her about the pager chirping... ""Well, it will light up when it's ready"". I was like, ya I knew that I decided she can go F herself, I'll just wait a bit more. 

So ok. We were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... She was a little more personable. So we sat, and sat... Well it was longer than it should have been. Got our popcorn :D, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... Told me the Rising Sun Burger I just placed my order for was the house favorite (Thanks Yelp!). It wasn't until she checked in on us, and at which I inquired about the plate I ordered when she got all defensive. I'm sorry, but I just couldn't recall if my burger had a fried egg on it or not. Thanks to all the photos on Yelp! Excuse me if I got confused. She proceeded to say things like, ""Well did you order one?"", ""Did you want one?"" As I explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. That is why you didn't receive a tip missy. Sorry if that ruined your day.

But with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... Holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude...

We were sitting in the lounge area by the bar doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the waitresses here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs. I'll get to the food in a second.

So we're sitting down and the waitress is right behind my friend Zach. She says, ""Would you guys like any drinks?"" Zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 F's. Like, an unintentional motorboat. Great life moment. Also, the little hostess with the tongue ring is highly attractive in that librarian kind of way, and you know she also owns thigh high boots... na'mean? I'd shake those buns. I'd let her hold my stein. With my eyes open and the lights on. Mmmmhmmm darlin'.

The shakes. The shakes are insanity in a glass. I ordered a Compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit. I mean that in the best way possible. Think of like - an excitement induced vomit. Like when you get married or something. Actually, that's probably not the best analogy. What I'm trying to say is the shakes are incredibly rich and tasty, and I would recommend the Compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness.

The burgers. The burger I ate was so delicious, there are no words to describe it. The best way to describe it would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies. I hadn't had anything like the kobe burger in a long time, and it's just what I wanted. My pants also wanted it, because I came home with the bad kind of stained pants. Messy burger.

The sweet potato fries were really good and I loved the truffle popcorn that they leave on the tables to snack on before your meal.

Don't come here if you're in a hurry to catch a show-- the service is sloooow even when the place isn't that busy.",0,0,0

The desk staff and bartenders are dressed more business like while the waitresses look like they came from Hooters. I was in the mood for a burger so I tried their Little Buns which were 3 slider sized burgers with onions ketchup and cheese. Great burger. Cooked just right and had nice hearty flavor. I also got a Frozen Grasshopper milk shake since I love mint. Got it non alcoholic which saved 3 bux but was still pricey at $8. Worth it tho. The bartender originally took it to the wrong table. The people there said it looked so good they decided to order it as well. I got there right after  they opened. By 12pm it was filling up so it's pretty popular. I definitely recommend this place.,0,0,0

It is like a banana milkshake with reeses cups. It is so good, that I ended up getting it again togo on my last day. I literally went out of my way and walked from the MGM to Holsteins just to get this lol.

I got the rising sun (their burger) which is really good. Very flavorful, rich, filling, and their fries are good too. I'd say a solid 8\/10 for the burger and a 9-10\/10 for the Drunken Monkey",1,0,0

Rising Sun ($18.50): Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado

--Wow! Unique burger that confused our taste buds. One minute we think we're eating Japanese food, and then reminded again that it's a burger! Kobe beef was juicy and cooked perfectly. I liked the crunchy textures provided by crispy yam and tempura avocado. There was a mixture of flavors but not overwhelming: sweet (teriyaki), savory (mayo) and salty (furikake).

Steakhouse Burger ($18.50): black pepper beef patty, mixed greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, Swiss cheese

--This one was closer to a classic tasting burger. It was like eating steak in burger form. The patty was thick! Bryan added pickles ($1).

Popcorn (free) made for a fun appetizer that's different from the norm. The fries (comes with each burger) were amazing, super crispy! We were too full from our huge burgers to finish the fries, sadly. I'd recommend the Rising Sun as it's one of a kind!",1,1,1

My friends and I were seated almost instantly. We pondered over the menu and struggled to pick our favorite burger because of all of the tasty options. I decided on the steakhouse burger and I also got a free Holsteins lager just for checking in on Yelp! The beer came out quickly and it was a nice light lager similar to a light Mexican beer. I tried not to finish it before the burger came out so I could enjoy them together. 

When my burger came out with the sweet potato fries, I took a bite and the flavors worked extremely well together. The burger was juicy and tasty, the cheese melted right on and the mushrooms and tomatoes topped it off. It took me a while to finish it as I tried to savor every bite. The sweet potato fries were large and soft but still had a nice crisp to them. They were tasty but not incredible. My friends onion rings were amazing and I would definitely get those when I eat here again.

Okay, now the good stuff...

And believe me, I've had my fair share of burgers. Okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  I must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that I had to ask for second!

For appetizer, we ordered the Surf and Turf Quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with Manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with Avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste

For main course, I ordered the Rising Sun burger (A must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. The juicy Kobe beef spread with the Teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. At the same time, the Spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. I also added a fried Egg which just kicks it up another notch. The steak fries that came with the burger just left me speechless as I could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs 

All in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at Vegas?

The environs and menu are creative and stylish, and yes, I appreciate an extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes. There's pretty much something for everyone, as long as everyone is up for some variation of a burger, including a vegan burger. All of this of course comes with Strip prices, so expect to spend around $18 a person for a burger and fries. Alcohol not included. 

First impression is a little bucket of popcorn they bring to the table. It's cute, but just some popcorn in a bucket. 

I had the turkey burger and onion rings. The turkey burger is a substantial creation, and it manages to be both big and juicy! Quite the accomplishment for a turkey patty. The toppings included sprouts and some tasty avocado spread. I will say that it definitely was not salty, but it didn't leave my taste buds poppin'. The cheese wasn't completely melted, and there wasn't a zing. I liked it, but I didn't love it.

And, then there were the onion rings. I paid $2 extra for these, and I was hoping for a good return on the investment. Alas, the onion rings were on the border of being burnt, and as a result, the onion was almost obliterated. I want more onion than breading. Varsity onion rings, anyone? (It's an Atlanta thang.)

we had the duck fat fries as well, which were not as good as i thought. the ketchup was actually mixed with relish or something so tasted ok but something like an aioli would have been better. we also split a regular strawberry milkshake, no alcohol. it was good but yea...

The hostess was an airhead, somehow she couldn't figure out we wanted to eat food when we said we'd like to E.A.T.  She pointed us in the direction of the bar and went proceeded to stand at the host station like Barbie.  We walked right by the bar and into the dining room and were stopped from self-seating ourselves by a busy server that spoke bimbo and was able to get through to the hostess to seat us properly.  

Our server wasn't much better.  We sat for a good while before we discovered who would be taking care of us.  He gave us water and then went MIA. for a good 10 minutes before he came back to take our order.  It started to seem like the food was taking a little longer than it should when our server stopped by our table confused and was like, ""where's your food""?  Um, shouldn't I be asking you that?

Aside from the airheads they had waiting on us, the food was actually pretty good.  For drinks, I had a Drunken Leprechaun.  However, by the time I got it, I wished it was more ""drunk"".  Two shots of Jameson were pretty undetectable in all that sweet, shakey goodness; lightly minty and sinfully rich.  Gotta love adult shakes tho, they had big ol' Bam-Boozled section on the menu just for em.  I just wish they'd triple up the boozled scale.

For food, El Machete; beef with chili, onions, pepperjack, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli.  Best damn burger I've ever eaten; big, complex flavors and a bad-ass juicy patty.  The fries, ala carte, were okay.

- Rising Sun: Kobe beef with a tempura avocado, genius. I ask for the teriyaki glaze on the side because it's too sweet for me and I also add a fried egg ($1). It's freaking awesome - just get it already. 
- Gold Standard: the aged goat cheddar cheese was too overpowering for me. It's good just not as good as Rising Sun.
- Korean Bullgogi: the kimchi was good. A little on the sweet side. 

Bottom line - just get The Rising Sun. I prefer the steak fries out of the shoestring fries, onion rings and steak fries but they're all really good. 

Shakes: don't make the mistake I did and get them to-go. You do not get as much as you would dining in and everyone knows the best part of a shake is that extra in the silver mixing cup.

For milkshakes, we were able to try the basic Strawberry and the alcohol infused Grasshopper.  I would definitely recommend trying at least one of the specialty alcohol milkshake.  The Grasshopper was definitely a hit among my friends.  Unfortunately for those who love tasting the danger in drinks, the alcohol amount is very light and you'll enjoy the unique mixture of sweet tastes rather than the intoxication.  

Like how the past reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the expensive side.  Each burger meal does come with a pint size-like bucket of fries but it's not worth puffing your stomach if you're planning to squeeze into a dress 2 hours later.

Service was wonderful and on point two out of the three times. On the other visit the server wasn't attentive and didn't check on us until we were finished. 

The food was excellent during the three visits. On the first visit I had the turkey burger it came with sprouts, tomato, onion, lettuce topped with pepper jack cheese. I stole a few of the hub's wedge cut fries and they were great with a good seasoning and not greasy. On the second visit I tried the house salad topped with salmon. It came with avocado, tomato and mixed greens with balsamic dressing. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the portion was just the right size. On the last visit I tried the vegan burger. It was a house made patty with veggies and had a crispy breaded outside. It came with lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best vegan burgers I have had. I don't know how they do it but the patty was juicy and was tasty. 

The drunken monkey adult shake is out of this world! A combo of banana, peanut butter cups, ice cream and liquor. It is a bit pricy for $11. bucks but they do fill a shake glass and give the metal cup with the extra shake. If you get a shake don't order a lot of food since this shake is almost a meal by itself or make sure to share. 

Price is average for a restaurant in Vegas $14-$18.00. Food is delish, ingredients are fresh, portions are large and for the most part service is good.

Their meat patties are just the right about of juicy (geez, salivating thinking about it). Not sure if its high fat content or what, but I really don't care, it's too good. Cheese is perfectly melted. If you are a mushroom fan, definitely check out the Funghi burger. Freakin' awesome. The fries are the right width and the right amount of crispy. 

Also, their shakes are great! Vegas is all about the booze. It's not too strong and you can't really taste the alcohol (I had the Drunkin' Monkey), but I could tell it was there. That's the sign of a good drink, haha. 

Prices are a bit high for a burger - but it's Vegas - what'd you expect?  Besides, win it all back at the tables. Good luck!

My fiancées burger on the other hand was pretty bland. We were expecting it to be super bbq as it had brisket on there but honestly it wasn't very impressive at all.

For dessert we ordered a campfire smores milkshake and that was probably the greatest milkshake ever. However, we were a bit disappointed bc it seemed like the portion you get for ordering it to go is less than the portion than if you were to order and drink it at the actual restaurant...

They start you off with a small bucket of pizza flavored popcorn and things only get even better from there. Hubby and I worked together for the whole meal, ordering different entrees and deserts so we could share. 

He got a burger that was covered in teriyaki sauce, little fried haystack sweet potatoes and a tempura avocado. The main flavor here was definitely the teriyaki. The sweet potatoes gave a nice crunch and the avocado provided a smooth, creamy texture. 

I ordered the current burger special - a Thanksgiving burger. It had a turkey patty, a patty of stuffing and was topped with cranberry sauce. The salty from the stuffing and sweet\/Tart from the cranberries complimented each other very nicely. 

For dessert, hubby got the cookies and cream shake. It was an Oreo shake topped with a cookie ice cream sandwich and the glass was rolled in cookie crumbs. The ice cream sandwich was decent - nothing life changing, but certainly yummy. The Shake was actually very well done, and this Is coming from someone who's pretty picky. It had a good amount of sweetness and was very creamy. I loved the cookie crumbs on the glass. They were stuck on using a thick, white icing that stupid sweet and delicious. 

I went for the Peanut Butter Crunch Brownie. Although it's much smaller than their epic shakes, this little thing really packs a punch! It had layers of dense brownie, chewy caramel and peanuts. This is definitely what I go for when it comes to dessert and I would absolutely order it again!

On a weekend trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stop by to get our fill of some burgers. We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and were told that a table of 3 would have a waiting period of approximately 30 minutes. They would take down our phone number, we would leave and actually get called back within 10 minutes. This is starting out to be a good experience, but.....

Our orders were taken fairly quickly and we were eager to begin our meal. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we started to get restless. Not only were we starving, but we had not heard from our waitress. We flagged her down and inquired about our order. When she returned, she said she wasn't sure why it was taking so long, so she offered us some cheese popcorn. 

We inhaled the 1st round of popcorn and a 2nd round was offered since our food was still being prepared. Our hunger for food continued to mount and with still no food in sight, our waitress offered to give us some steak fries. Again, another 2 rounds of fries came out and after an hour of waiting for our food, we finally received our order. 

Ahi Sliders, Korean ""Bull"" GoGi and the Rising sun were ordered. The Ahi sliders were served between 2 buns that appeared to have been chilled. I don't know about most, but cold bread to me is not edible. Both the Korean ""Bull"" GoGi and Rising Sun burgers were overly charred on the outside to the point that they had this burnt taste to them (both were ordered to be cooked Medium). This was quite disappointing and most of the meal was not even finished. 

After our meal, the waitress comes over and asks why we didn't finish the ahi sliders because she notices that most people don't. I am thinking Really?!? We told her the buns were a bit cold and it didn't go well with the ahi. She went on and asked how did we enjoy the burgers and we told her about the burnt taste. She said that's what Holstein's prides itself in cooking their burgers and that some customers like the charred taste on their burgers. I don't know where these customers reside from, but they should understand that burnt\/charred food is unhealthy. I do give her credit as she did whatever she could to keep our spirits up throughout the meal and tried to keep our dining experience a positive one, but....

When we were settling the bill, we wanted to use our Groupon to be applied to the bill. This was a headache as the fries from earlier that were supposed to have been comped by our waitress were included on the bill. Trying to apply the Groupon just confused the manager\/waitress even more. Overall, the dining experience did not live up to our expectations. I'd rather roll over to Burger Bar next time.",2,2,1

I had The Gold Standard with a fried egg both times. It was just so good, I didn't feel the need to order anything else. My burger was perfectly medium rare both times and all of the ingredients went together beautifully (including the bun, which can really make or break my enthusiasm towards a burger). Call me sheltered, but I don't think I've had a burger with arugula on it before. And I am a cheeseburger fiend.

My boyfriend and I split a Drunken Monkey milkshake the first time we went and while it wasn't exactly strong, it was still freaking delicious.

During meal time, they give you a side of popcorn to start with. This is no regular popcorn either.. It's spiked with some kind of seasoning I can't figure out. Either way, it's an explosion in your mouth and your taste buds will be a little confused.

Burgers are pretty massive. I got the Hen House. (Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup) no mustard and no onion for me. But wow, the bacon in this burger was some thick cut bacon. And the egg of course made the burger sooo much better. I got a side of sweet potato fries and yea.. I couldn't finish my meal. Ha. My friend and I split a strawberry milkshake as well. Typical American burger meal . It was my last meal in Vegas. It certainly hit the spot and sent me home right.

I ordered the Billionaire buger. It's a burger named after one of the owners (i'm assuming bill). it's priced accurately for a burger with foie gras and it comes with fries.

I got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. I ordered the classic medium rare with American cheese and onion rings. My burger came back and when I cut the burger in half.. blood came out of the patty.. Definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief.

Yes the décor is funky fresh. Artsy and trendy and the service was decent (the servers were not 100% in tune to what they were serving). But the overall visit was not what I hoped.

The breakdown: I was invited by The Light Group to dine in before the club. So, there were tables of beautiful women dressed to impress but not ready to chow down wearing their club attire (me included). Deep Fried everything, and not the best samples of their burgers. (the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). It was a pleasure to be hosted by them and I would have not discovered them otherwise.

But ....

Second ""chance"" Visit (Late May) I was in heaven ... even if for a moment.

The breakdown: It was recovery Sunday (from Saturday night gallivanting). We all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so I gave it a second try. It was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.

There was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. The way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.

I had: The Golden Standard (because I just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger ""Billionaire Burger"" though I was tempted). and it was delicious. Didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. It was made to perfection (medium) I chose a side of Sweet Potato Fries which were decent, but a little soggy at the end.
While I waited, I washed down a Brown Cow Float, which was basically a turnt up Rootbeer Float with ""pop rocks"" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. LOVED IT!!
I tried their Bucket of Buffalo Wings, and I liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. I enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal. 

I guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a HUGE difference.

Starting with my fav ciroc vodka...the bartenders are always happy to make me a fun, delicious martini before I go to my table.  I always have the spicy shrimp cocktail and then usually the longhorn burger because it reminds me of the south where I'm from!  Of course, with no bun or sauce!  :)  My friends LOVE their shakes with alcohol, especially the cereal one, lol.  The staff is very cool and friendly.  The atmosphere is perfect because it's in the middle of all the Cosmopolitan action.  You can see the lines forming outside marquee, the glamour of the Chandelier bar and right below is the action filled casino.  Good times are guaranteed at Holsteins!",1,0,0

Casual and funky vibe. Lots of seating and the interior decor is swanky with funky cows and Spider-Man pickles lining the wall. Love that you can also get an alcoholic milkshake....wuhhhhh that's so cool! I would have gotten it...but sadly I'm lactose intolerant and I was already taking a chance by getting a regular milkshake haha...
The burgers come out pretty fast, but the milkshakes take awhile to make. They give some pretty tasty complimentary popcorn, it has a sort of Cajun seasoning on it.

-cookies and cream milkshake \/\/ gets 10 stars! I loved the giant cookie ice cream sandwich and the quality of the milkshake was amazing!!!! It's huge and super filling so it's good if you have someone to share it with!

Wonder if I would have got better service if I was just seated. They have three different bartenders and I waited probably 15 minutes before my husband and I just walked out. The sad part is they are not even busy and these people just clean wine glasses, take in receipts but never want to take an order?? 
    My husband asked one women if she was able to change the channel to a specific game, her reply was to give him the dirtiest look and tell him something like it was not a job she was able to do at this time. It was beyond rude and I guess this really made her not want to take our order. My husband who is always pretty nice to all women had to stoop to her level and ask if she could find someone who can change the channel then. 15 minutes after zero acknowledgment we walked out.
            As we walk out we were glad the business was slow enough to tell both managers Ryan & Ryan how bad the staff behind the bar was. I would refer to them as bartenders but they don't seem to want to do that job.",0,0,0

We got the lobster mac 'n cheese, alcoholic tiramisu shake, funghi, and rising sun burger. 

The lobster mac 'n cheese was good, with nice chunks of lobster and a creamy but still liquid pasta sauce (and campanelle pasta! nice touch), but there was just so little of it. It came in the same small, shallow cast iron dish that their dips came in (as we saw at the other table), and for a price of $17, too steep for my mac 'n cheese wallet.

The alcoholic tiramisu shake was not very noticeably alcoholic. And the shakes themselves are pretty much the same price as their burgers, but we just figured go big or go home. It was pretty delicious and a bit too sweet when it melted and tasted like liquefied tiramisu, which was the closest thing to refreshing when I got sick of all the savory orders.

The funghi was moderately disappointing, the not-disappointed side mainly because I was hungry.. It consisted of a beef patty, roasted portabello mushroom, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere cheese, frisee as vegetation, and aioli...what type, I'm not completely sure. It was $16.50, pretty large and beefy, with a meaty portabello...but still, a bit bland for my palate...there wasn't much sha-zam in the burger, mushroom afficionado or not.

The rising sun burger was supposed to be the showstopper...the idea of it sounds absolutely ingenious, and I was initially very excited for it. Built of a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado, it sounds like someone took a delicious burger and prepared it with a Japanese pantry. And the individual points were all present with the burger, but I felt like the burger was overwhelming my salty and sweet taste buds. The teriyaki glaze was way too much, either too sweet and salty or too much sheer quantity for the burger. The nori furikake was actually kind of salty too, which disillusioned me from furikake for a while...the tempura avocado was soggy and the batter, too thick and not crispy. Which I guess happens when you deep fry and avocado and then stuff it between a huge slab of ground beef and a tower of toppings. After finishing it I felt the need to chug my glass of water...so the burger cost me $17 and an extra trip to the bathroom.

In foresight of these issues, we ordered two sides of raw onion...very nicely, thinly sliced, in a way that let it melt in your mouth so that you only tasted the sweetness of the onion, but yet it was a full indisputable bite of onion. Delectable. Those onions were a side dish to everything that night, they just seemed to make everything better.

Holstein's is alright, you know? It really has some great concepts with the creative gourmet burgers and alcoholic milk shakes, but a little better execution would be valued. I'd give it a 2.5 - 2.7 stars if I could, mostly due to the steep prices for what was a semi-disappointing meal.",2,1,0

The Rising Sun burger was definitely innovative and unique. The avocado was well fried and the medium-rare Kobe patty was cooked to perfection. The teriyaki glaze itself was too sweet for my liking.

We were in a large group (20 or so), but we had a reservation, and they could have given us more than one server. It took about 20 minutes every time we needed a drink refill.  We ended up ordering a tiny $11 plate of lettuce (I almost sent it back, because my salad was supposed to have 7 things in it.  I eventually found them hidden in the lettuce.  They were all about the size of a fourth of a corn kernel, and there were maybe 10 of them total.)  We also ordered a $9 lamb sausage that was about the size of my pinkie, and came in a bun 4 times its size.  It would have been good if the proportions were more reasonable.  We had some fries, and they were fine.  The rising sun burger ($16) we had was actually really good, and it's the only reason I'm adding a second star.

What annoyed me most about this evening (other than my crappy salad) is that when we got the check, the server brought us a copy of the total, and an itemized receipt...the itemized receipt was torn in a weird place.  We realized that it was actually torn just before the part where it would have said that gratuity was included, because of our large party.

The service was quite slow for 6 people and the food was underwhelming.  We each ordered burgers, but I didn't think anything was special about it.  I also had onion rings.   I was a bit annoyed when I asked if I could have half onion rings, and half fries.  The waiter replied ""We won't customize anything here.  Even if you wanted your burger cut in half, we would just give you a knife.""

That for me makes me give Holsteins 3 stars.  I had the grass hopper milk shake as well (with an extra shot).  The problem with service being so slow, was that by the time the food came, I had pretty much finished the milk shake and was quite full.

Overall, Holsteins is not very memorable, and I would rather go to BURGR or Burgar Bar.  There clearly was a reason why Hosteins had no wait, and the other burger places did.",0,0,0

That's an awesome feature. Who wants to stand in front of Holsteins for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sports book?! I received the text, although we snagged a spot at the bar before it came. 

Food:
Truffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w\/ Maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. Two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. It tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. That first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. Boo. We left half of it there and I refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not true

Nom Nom Burger ($16.50 - Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. On one hand, the beef was realllllly good. Flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. On the other hand, the toppings added 0. My theory is they need to triple what they put on top the burger. When you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. Conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.

Drinks:
Ginger Julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite.
 
Rhubarb Pie Bam-Boozled Shake ($11 - Absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. Should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? Probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!

We decided to drop by here for a quick lunch before Marquee Dayclub, since it's right outside Marquee's main entrance on the 2nd level. For some reason or another, we decided to sit in the bar and lounge area, instead of the dining area. The lounge had a few couches and chairs and we found a spot that fit seven of us. The rest of our group decided to sit at the bar.

Not all of us ate, and I honestly don't even remember if I had a burger or not. If I did, it was obviously pretty unmemorable. I do remember getting fries and those were pretty standard. I also remember the service being on the poor side, but it wasn't a big deal. At that time, if you checked in on Foursquare, you could get a free pint of beer. Our server said all 10 of us had to check in and show him the check-in for us to get it. Not all of us had Foursquare or cell service, so that was kind of irritating and inefficient. I mean, technically he didn't do anything wrong, but you know there are always those servers who are more lax and will get you the freebie without actually seeing the check-in. This guy was not one of those servers.

Every time I pass by Holsteins since then, I get bad vibes so I doubt I'd ever come back, unless it's for convenience. If I'm going to Dayclub, I'd rather get bottle service and food from Marquee, which is surprisingly tasty, than eat at Holsteins again.",4,2,2

The rising sun with a fried egg on top - really good. Their meat is juicy, got it medium. Bread is spongy and compliments the burger. The teriyaki was a little too sweet for my liking but the fried egg mellowed it out.

Ariel was very helpful when I called to make the reservation. When we got there, they wouldn't seat us until more than half of our party had arrived. Once we finally sat the service was just really bad. It took forever for anyone to come and greet us and take our drink orders. When they did I ordered a pitcher of sangria that was on the drink menu and the waiter told me that they don't do pitchers. I told him it was on the menu but if they stopped making pitchers then we would just have 2 glasses. He said he'd have to check on that. He had only taken half of the table's drink orders and rather than take the rest he left to figure out about the sangria situation. He finally came back and said they don't make sangria anymore, ok fine. So we ordered the Berry Fresh specialty cocktails and those were actually quite good. They put out popcorn which is a nice touch and tasted very good but it was only 2 small bowls for our group of 12 and they never refilled or asked if we wanted more. Most of us ended up ordering burgers, mine was a turkey burger and it was ok, nothing special although the fries were good. No one ever checked to make sure we were happy with our food. After eating we just payed our bill right away and left. We actually went and had a drink at the bar right outside of Holstein's before heading to Marquee, maybe we would have stayed for another drink there but we all just wanted to leave. Honestly the food was decent and I would maybe consider giving them another try to check out the spiked milkshakes which looked very good, but the service really made our impression of Holstein's pretty negative so I'm not sure if I'll be back.

So convincing that I changed my order from the California Turkey to the Rising Sun (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado - sub for Turkey Patty + Add Fried Egg). The terikyaki glaze isn't so much a glaze - it's goopy and way too sweet. Thus, I couldn't even drown it in ketchup. If you love the taste of beef jerky, you'll like this burger!

The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths\/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.

As for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international\/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese's, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio\/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.

As for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  

Overall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  ""That's a pretty f*cking good milkshake\/burger. I don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.",16,10,8

Food and Drinks: 
Ahi Sliders 
Steak Fries - comes in pail 
Miller Lite Beer - poured from can
Spicy Bloody Mary 
Bloody Orange Cosmo 

The Ahi Sliders comes in 3 and were presented just like any regular red meat sliders.  I thought it was fun to have Ahi Tuna in slider form.  The buns were sweet and easy to bite into (kind of reminded me of King's Hawaiian Bread) and inside the buns, there were Asian-styled pickled veggies (carrots, cucumbers, etc).  It also came with chilli mayo sauce if you like your food on the heavier side.  I did not find the sauce a bit spicy.  5 stars for just the steak fries!  I mean, how were each single fry perfectly seasoned, warm, and crispy?  I hope it wasn't just luck that we got the most perfect tasty fries.

I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary (peppered and cilantro infused).  It really was spicy and I do have an insane tolerance for spiciness compared to others.  As for the bloody mary part, it was okay.  The Bloody Orange Cosmo was a great way to cleanse my palate.  It tasted fresh just as it appeared.  I felt that they were generous with the amount of alcohol that came in both cocktails.  

Service:
I lose track of the date and time in Vegas but it must have not been during prime dinner time because we immediately sat ourselves but towards the end of our meal\/drinks, I noticed it does get really crowded.  Really friendly and prompt staff!  Our server would give us her personal input on our selection and because I liked everything I got, her comments felt genuine.  

Other notes: 
We sat in individual lounge seats - comfortable and roomy.  You can also view the game playing at Cosmo's Sports Book directly across if you get the exterior seats.  When we were ready to leave, I asked if we can take our drinks across in order for my fiance to finish his sports bet games ... our server was kind enough to pour them into plasticware.  Later during my stay at Cosmo, I learned that you can easily access this side of the casino right off the 2nd floor of the guest elevators.

My friend got the Rising sun and Maple Bacon shake. 

The burgers and fries came out faster than the shake which was kind of strange. Unfortunately, after taking the first bite out of the gold standard, the word ""MEH"" popped in my head immediately. I took a bite out of my friend's Rising sun, and felt EXTREME JEALOUSY. That burger had more flavor and deliciousness.

The hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. I am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through the bottom bun and makes the burger fall apart. Then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. Never good. 

Anyway, the hen house was tasty. They seem to skimp on the fries though. They were tasty, but the cup of fries you get seems a little small. 

As for drinks, they have quite a few wines and craft beers available, which was nice.

Holsteins is in the Cosmopolitan Casino on the 2nd floor shopping area. I was there a little after the lunch hour and had no problem getting a seat at the bar (I was flying solo until my peeps arrived in Vegas). 

The service was decent and I quickly ordered the ""Gold Standard"" burger with dry aged sirloin, goat cheese, bacon, arugula and a wheat bun. Let's just say the burger was OK and the bun was the highlight. 

Whatever taste of the sirloin was drowned out by the goat cheese. It was basically a goat cheese burger. The ingredients were fresh and the bun was the best hamburger bin I've ever had...but that isn't going to get it a 4-star rating.

The shoestring fries were cooked to perfection by extremely salty. Maybe it is to help you retain water in the desert climate. Or maybe the cook spent too much time on the Strip last night. Who knows?!

Bottom line. Holsteins was the typical flashy, overpriced midrange Vegas restaurant letdown. Good, but certainly not great...and not worth the price.",0,0,0

Definitely come by. My friends who ordered the regular burgers LOVED them. One of my friends got the banana cream pie shake and we all tried it. One word: WOW!

At first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti décor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar\/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! 

We decided to stop by and try this place out before we left Vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). The hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! 
We were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. The lounge\/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. 
We settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. This place has almost everything you could ask for:

Shakes (bam -boozled shakes)
IPA's
Beer
Wine
One of a kind cocktails

But what I liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. Who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!

All their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!

With so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. 

I decided on the Nom Nom Burger- No bun, Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing

I have to admit I was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. I use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! But screw that though I told myself I'm going in!

After ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! And believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  One guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. You would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in Vegas! He tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. Still the look on his face was priceless!

Our burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) I had to try some of Minh's onion rings (which were delicious) I could have ate them all except I was given the ""eye"" so I swiped two more and went back to my burger! 

It was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! The burger was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!

Be warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though I opted not to have the bun I got full half way through! I forced myself to finish this epic burger, which I am 50\/50 that I did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy!

They give this pizza seasoned popcorn for the table before you order\/before your food comes and honestly, I'm still thinking about that popcorn weeks later. It was so addicting and delicious. Their burgers were great and I am even curious to go back and try their vegan burger as well. I couldn't leave Holsteins without trying one of their alcoholic shakes. I got the s'mores one and I would suggest going for the extra shot of alcohol if you are looking for that. I didn't opt for the extra alcohol, and I feel like I might as well have had a normal non-alcoholic shake. Definitely still a delicious shake though!

Don't forget to check in for 50% off of a beer! 

Aside from the food, the service is great! Our server was so helpful with the menu and answered any questions we had while also providing his own opinions and suggestions. This is exactly what I hope for when visiting a new restaurant.

This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1\/3 of the price and 3 times better.

There were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch. 

My only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.

Many restaurants close around 10-10:30 and I love when something is open later so I can eat a second quality dinner aka not fast food when I get hungry. 

I decided on the mac and cheese because 1. I love love love cheese and pasta and 2. Their lobster is flown in fresh in everyday which is appealing. The macaroni was so cheesy and I devoured it in 5 minutes. It also came with a chip that had some kind of lobster dip on it. Yum yum! The only thing that would have been better would be a larger portion; I thought it was a tad small. 

I also ordered the upside down cake martini. It was the best martini I ever had and finished it in five minutes. It was more of a dessert martini so if you're not a fan of that then I wouldn't get it. If they were cheaper I would have ordered a second. I would recommend this drink to anyone who loves girly drinks! I also recommend their adult milkshakes. Its a milkshake with liquor mixed in. The first time I tried one was their cereal one.

The food was very good and delicious! My wife ordered the Blueberry Pie shake without the booze in it (we're pregnant) and it was just as good as eating the pie itself!

Milkshakes are delicious! Expensive, but delicious! Seriously, that was the first thing that flashes in my head when I think of that milkshake. We got the black and white malted, and unf, I would love to have it again. Don't know if it was worth the price though. 

So I like it. Got the Bulgogi burger because 1) I love bulgogi burgers and 2) I don't remember the last time I had one.

My verdict? You know, it was good, but there needs to be more kimchi (hello, I'm Korean), the marinade is weaksauce (seriously needs more), and I don't think I'm a fan of a bulgogi burger made with ground beef and no mayo. It's not a bad burger, just not for me. I would've liked it a little more like how my mom makes it, or how I'm used to in Korea: lots of thin slices of delicious, tender, fragrant marinated beef with some mayo.

Atmosphere was great. I like eating at a trendy place with a DJ spinning. It's nice and it gives it a club atmosphere. The wait staff was really friendly, and the food came out pretty fast. I love how things come out in little buckets. Cute!

Portions are... on the smaller side. Maybe I'm used to mountains of fries coming out with my burgers, but it was a little bit of a let down.

I also didn't realize that this place only serves burgers. I felt so bad for my boyfriend because he does NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES for reasons fuzzy eat burgers. There was almost nothing for him to eat, and so he barely ate anything. He got the Meatball Grinder, and it was a super tiny order on buns, which he didn't eat.

Also if you check-in on yelp you get a free 12oz draft. My daughter got a cheese sandwich meal which was decent but the mini fudge sundae made it worth 6$ (see pic). It was large, and yummy with a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Easily fed the 3 of us and we didn't even finish it. All said with tax, tip... It was worth paying 55$. I'd still prefer In\/Out but it was Thanksgiving and the only establishments open are on the strip. Only minus a star for the price.",0,0,0

There, I said it...  It seems like no matter what major city you are in, there's some strong competition on who has the best burger.  It isn't as if we see the same thing with who has the best beshbarmak (go ahead and look it up, edu-ma-cate yourselves), right?

But with that said, I must admit, I'm a bit of a burger fiend.  I do love me a good burger.  Always medium rare, and I also tend to look for interesting topping combinations to see how creative the kitchen is.

This is where I've been going wrong all this time.

You see, something needs to be said and credit needs to be given to the places that honor the burger for what it is SUPPOSED to be.  A patty made of ground beef served between two slices of bread, usually in bun form.  Toppings are typically added to compliment the meat and bread combination.  That's it.

It is with that in mind that I have to say Holstein's does a pretty mean burger.

Their meat is spectacular.  Maybe the best beef patty out there.  Assuming they use their namesake breed, I can tell you that the beef is very flavorful, and yet holds up in its patty form without being too greasy.

We split two orders with the notion of being able to taste a couple of their burgers.  Both were quite nice, and had pretty simple toppings.  The bun is notable since it has a lovely glaze on it and holds up well to all the juices that come off the patty and toppings.  The meat, as noted before, is the star.  Toppings, at least in our case, were more like condiments that complimented the beef rather than over powering the flavors.

In a way, very simple, but done correctly.

It also needs to be said that the Frozen Grasshopper is amazing.  Imagine a Shamrock Shake with booze in it, except it still just tastes like a better version of the Shamrock Shake.  Got it?  Yep- it's really good...

Beer selection is a'ight.  Prices are a bit steep compared to many ""gourmet"" burger joints, but PLEASE REMEMBER where the hell you are.  Does ANYTHING come at a ""reasonable"" price on the Strip?  When you consider that fact, I'd say Holstein's actually is a very reasonable place to grab a meal.",5,3,3

What we ordered:
Truffle lobster mac & cheese
Mini burger bites with steak, foie gras & arugula (2)
Mini lobster rolls (2)
Onion rings

My first impression when the food arrived at our table was how tiny the portions were for the hefty price tag. Then, I immediately thought to myself that it must be because the food tastes phenomenal. I was wrong. The steak in the burger bites was dry. There was not enough truffle flavor & lobster in the mac & cheese. The lobster rolls were sub par and bland tasting. However, the onion rings were delicious, probably the best I've had. It's kind of sad that the onion rings were the highlight of our meal. There's too many yummy places in Vegas to try...I won't be coming back.",1,0,0

We had two different burgers and both were great - meat was properly cooked (they recommend medium, which you can get away with at a quality high-end burger joint like this), toppings were great, and the bun was very fresh (tiny bit too large for my taste, but not massive like at some places).  We had both fries and rings.  The only reason I gave a 4 vs 5 star rating was the fries - they were lukewarm instead of hot.  The onion rings were great.

The hostesses were......not the most welcoming. I don't know why, but they were distracted and just not very nice. Not rude, just not nice.

We had multiple waiters but one in particular who was dressed differently than anyone else in all black was probably someone special like the manager or something. He was super nice and VERY helpful when it came to ordering our food. I wanted to leave him a bigger tip but we weren't sure who would get it so we just left a 15% tip. I would not have left that much though if it wasn't for him. Service was slow and needed repeating multiple times. By chance, one of my friends and his girlfriend were seated next to us. She asked for her food to go. She got it and then asked for her check. By the time she got her check (which she had to ask for again) she had finished the food she had gotten ""to go"".

The food was really good. I ordered the Duck Duck Goose because nice-waiter-guy said it was the most popular and very gourmet. Maybe so, but I didn't enjoy it that much. The taste was weird to me and it was kind of dry.

The Rising Sun on the other hand was completely excellent to me!!!! So much and many flavors. If you've read my other reviews, I'm all about many flavors!!! ----------get this!

I've been on a moderate diet cutting out the regular bad foods on a daily basis but since I was in town, I decided to fudgeittt! It's been 6 months since I've had a burger and fries.

Their menu is full of gourmet burgers which reminded me of Umami but a bit more on the high end with dry aged beef, kobe, and lamb.  I was tempted to try the Gold Standard which was supposedly voted best burger in Vegas, but instead, I opted for ""The Rising Sun"". It consist of kobe beef with nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and a tempura avocado.  Enjoyed every bite of this burger.

Burger came with shoestring fries or steakcut fries. I chose the steak cut fries and was a bit disappointed. It was cut in wedges and had a light coating of flour.  Didn't care for it. I was really hoping for thick cut fries with lots of ketchup and a dash of tabasco.

I was tempted to try their bam boozed shakes which are concoctions of different shakes paired with liquors. It would be too heavy for lunch so I opted not to. Plus, I had an 11 course dinner the prior night.

Holstein's is located on the strip inside the Cosmo.  

What does that mean?  It means that you'll probably have to wait a bit to be seated, a meal here is going to cost a grip, and you may be surrounded by that ""Vegas Baby"" crowd.   It would be very easy to hate on Holstein's.  But I understand what to expect on the strip in regards to the wait times and prices.  Besides, no one forced me to come here.  All that being said, the burgers here are pretty good and only quality beef is served here.  I got the Gold Standard on my first visit and amazed with the thickness, the juiciness, and taste.  It's basically a quality steak in a bun.  I recently got the Nom Nom Burger and it was good too, but lacked the thickness\/size of the Gold Standard.  One things for sure, I'll be having the Gold Standard the next time I come back.  I can't even tell you how good or bad the desserts are because I don't have a sweet tooth and honestly, I just don't remember.  But I suggest that you try them because Holstein's is also known for their desserts.

One of the best burgers I've ever had, actually.  I split this with my boyfriend along with an order of sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Everything was good and service was friendly.

The server came over and took our drink orders and told us the specials right away.

To start we ordered the pork sliders and pork belly buns.. Someone loves pork!  They were both pretty good.  The pork sliders had an Asian twist with cilantro and peanut sauce.  It was a good combination.  The pork belly buns were good and tasty, but a little too fatty for my tasting.  I took a bite and it was all fat. No meat at all.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't like the fat texture.  Overall the appetizers were good.  We also ordered amazing onion rings that were stacked really high.  They were so crispy and so good. 

I ordered the rising sun burger cooked medium.  It was delicious and I think I could've eaten it all myself, but I shared it.  It came with steak fried which were thick but crispy.  

Other people ordered a salad which looked good, but didn't taste good.  (But who orders a salad at a burger joint?) It was a waste if money because it costs doubled for the salad compared to my burger.  I'm sure they will never order a salad at a burger joint ever again. 

Service was good and they gave us popcorn as he delivered everyone water.  I wanted to ask when the movie started.  The popcorn was good.  

Some people in my group didn't like it, but i didn't order a salad at a burger joint so I really liked my burger.  Will definitely go back to try a shake with my burger.",0,0,0

HAVE AN AMAZING selection of BEERS. BEER. BURRRR. Probably the best i've seen in LV so far. Anytime you have a wide selection of San Diego beers I am in LOVE!!!! SO kudos for that. Double Kudos for the SHAKES. Shake. SHHHHaaaWHAAAA.

We sat in the lounge area because there isn't much of a wait compared to the table dining area. Our waitress wasn't very good though. She never really checked on us and took forever to give us our tab, but I rarely base my ratings on the service.

GOLD STANDARD* \/ 17.5
Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli

The goat cheese and tomato confit made this burger worth the price! Well almost worth the price. I either was super hungry or a Holstein Heifer! I ate the whole thing! yup! Don't be fooled by my 113lb ass! Oh and I added avocado and a fried egg!!! yup! I did that!

The various burger offerings and descriptions made it difficult to choose but I finally settled on the steakhouse burger.  

My burger was perfectly cooked\/seasoned and was topped off with an obscene amount of grilled onions and mushrooms.  The steakcut fries were good but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the orange dreamsicle shake which was awesome and not overly rich like the grasshopper shake my buddy ordered.

One of the best burgers I've had in a very long time, and the overall meal was exceptional and reasonably priced.  Went with a buddy of mine for a late lunch, expecting to pop in and out, but this was a meal worth savoring.  I got the Lobster Truffled Mac & Cheese to start, which was slightly runnier than I would have liked, due to what the waiter referred to as ""copious amounts of tellagio and mascarpone cheeses"", but the dish was flavorful and solid.

The real treat however was the burger.  My friend and I both had the Gold Standard, his without the goat cheddar in favor of regular cheddar, and mine with.  They were both cooked perfectly, which is hard to do when you get an order for ""Extremely Rare, and I mean mooing"", but they nailed it.  They nailed my medium rare as well, and the combination of the tomato confit in place of standard tomato (simply brilliant idea, why have I not seen that done before?) and the strong cheese combined with a thick, juicy, perfectly prepared piece of bacon and garlic-chive aoili made it the first burger I haven't put ketchup on in I can't even remember how long, and I'm so glad I did.  Ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation.

Despite the raving, I considered giving this review 4 starts rather than 5 due to the consistency of the appetizer and the over-saltiness of the steak fries that came with my burger, but ultimately, those trivial details pale in comparison to the awesome that was that burger.  If you're in Vegas, and you're looking for a meal that won't break your budget and will give you plenty to talk about, try out Holsteins.  You will not be sorry.  Also, if waitresses that are easy on the eyes are your thing, I suggest sitting at the bar and ordering from there.",3,0,0

Obviously recommend the Cookies and cream and they even serve you the rest in an other cup since it doesn't fit the whole cup. 
The burgers are okay. I got the longhorn burger and it was too heavy. The sauce was kinda drench making the buns a bit too drench. I had a bite of the Nom Nom Burger, I would recommend that a lot more. Still, bachi's burgers are a lot better and more fresh imo.",0,0,0

I wish I didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while the burgers here are pretty good, I wouldn't go wild over it. The manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 PM on a Saturday.  That's definitely a star well earned there.  

The service was very good.  Warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. I loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  There's another two star there.

I ordered the Gold Standard ($18) and added a fried egg ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for sweet potato fries ($2).  I ordered it Medium Rare because I love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  My expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall I say udder disappointment), my burger came out Medium Well.  Ewww.  Ground cardboard.  While the burger was still good, having it medium rare could have made it THAT much better and probably one of the best burgers.  So it was just good, not amazing.  I was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  At least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out Medium well to Well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  Um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  For $21 I was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.      

I didn't have any shakes because I'm not into shakes, but I had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.   

I would rule this place completely out, but I can't give it bragging rights either.  I still prefer Red Robin  burgers over my experience at Holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  Good burgers but poor execution.  I would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, I'd still with Cheeseburger in Paradise or Red Robin.  We'll try again later, Holstein's!",8,8,9

My SO and I came here because other yelp reviews said they had a gluten free bun for their burgers. However after I asked the waitress about it she said they didn't. She went to check anyways and found out they did indeed actually have them. I just got a plain basic burger with a gluten free bun as to not make it more complicated about which add ons are gluten free or not. And to be honest, I did not feel very reassured by the waitress who seemed to go back and forth about what I could eat or not eat. She said that none of the sides are gluten free but they could do a salad for me. Great. Except I found out later that the salad was an extra $3 that she hadn't mentioned. I would have just gotten no side. I also got their vegan adult shake, which I was told is gluten free. I also can't have dairy so it was fun to actually have a shake. 

Their burger was okay. My gluten free bun and my SO's regular bun both were falling apart as we were eating. I think they got too soggy. It also took us the longest time to get refills on our water and for my SO to get his beer. He ordered it first thing and he didn't get it till after the food arrived. The food took a long time too. The vegan shake was good (but get it without the soy whipped cream, that stuff is nasty). We won't be returning here.

You can self-park in the Cosmopolitan garage. It's usually packed, but it's free parking. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan near Marquee and Eggslut. Restaurant decor has the cow mascot plastered on the walls. The ambience is nice and noisy, as expected of Vegas.

FOOD
I got the Rising Sun burger ($18). It has a Kobe beef patty with teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. The Kobe beef was cooked well, I got it medium done. The burger was oozing with flavor and quite enjoyable. All burgers come with fries, but they were forgettable. Complementary popcorn is available and you can ask for free refills. The popcorn had a BBQ flavor to it. 

SERVICE
Good customer service by our server. We were frequently, but not overbearingly, checked to make sure everything was going good. Our server also allowed us to split the check individually, making it easier for us to pay for our meals. 

CONCLUSION
The burgers are expensive, similar to any gourmet burger place in Vegas. In my opinion, I'm not sure it's worth it, but it never hurts to try something new. My Kobe beef was cooked well, but my friend's beef didn't match the same quality. On the plus side, it was a filling meal. Complementary popcorn was also a good gesture on their part and left us satisfied. So while I probably won't be back, overall, they are an alright establishment for gourmet burgers.",1,2,2

Now, you would think that when he discovered they were out of one beer, he would have checked to see which others might not be available. Nope.

A few items on the menu were good, but I went there hoping for a great burger. I got the Rising Sun burger, which sounded outstanding. Kobe beef, avocado, and spicy mayo, doesn't that sound delicious? Well, sadly it was disappointing. The burger was not cooked the way we wanted and avocado overpowered the flavor of the whole burger. I thought Holsteins was known for their buns, but it was nothing special.

I also had the pork belly buns, which was the only good entree we had at Holsteins. I would of preferred the pork belly to be more tender, but it wasn't bad. 

Service was not the best either. If you are known to be open for late night dining, you have to be on top of the service too. It took us awhile to get our food and our waitress was not friendly.

I'm a bit bummed the pizza twinkies are no longer around, but the buffalo chicken dip is a nice addition. Honestly I make yummier buffalo chicken dip at home, but it's nice to have someone else make it for you :) 

Lastly, I urge you to try the delicious shakes! The birthday cake one is amazing, but my favorite is the first one on the menu (monkey something or other) with peanut butter and banana. YUM. With or without booze, these shakes are amazing!

We ordered the fried pickles which were decent. The insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. I am pretty sure these are frozen, though. My grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and I tried those. Pretty sure these were the exact same ones. 

My husband is a huge burger fan. I don't know if he loves anything more.
He got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter).
When I asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. I was shocked. He said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else. 

I had the blackened salmon po-boy. It was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. I had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. Overall, a good choice. The slaw on it was really good. I got sweet potato fries and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. Good, but nothing crazy amazing.

We didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah.

It's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  Once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; I'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.

I had the Gold Standard cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  The burger was quite good.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers I've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  The bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.

I upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  It was my first time trying duck fat fries, but I wasn't impressed.  I was hoping to taste some duck in there!  They were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and I would recommend those instead.  I also had the Campfire Smores spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  Very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.

Moove on up to the 2nd floor of The Cosmo & graze at Holsteins Shakes & Buns. It's a cutesy, cow-themed, casual Americana restaurant\/sports bar that serves a variety of gourmet burgers & sliders, fries, apps, salads & yes you can get an adult shake with those fries! 

I came here in the afternoon for a 'tween meal & just wanted something light but substantial enough to tide me over til dinner. Sorry, I didn't try a burger or shake but there is a good selection of burgers available in several different protein options & a variety of intoxicatingly, sweet shakes (with or without alcohol) that looked sinfully tasty! 

I opted for healthy & ordered the ""Greener Pastures Salad"" ($10) which includes house greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, shaved carrots & avocado, and I added grilled chicken breast for $8. So it was $18 total but was a generous-sized salad & the veggies were fresh & the chicken was tasty. I would recommend this salad if you want a healthy, filling lunch option. 

I also got a side o'sweet potato fries that came served in a cute lil, silver tin bucket for $6. They were straight-cut, soft, tasty & without any unwanted sugary-coating, 4 gems!

FYI: You can grab a seat at the bar or at a table in the bar area or wait & get a table in the dining room for full service. I sat at a first-come, first-serve table in the bar area. Service was friendly & efficient, and my food was brought out fairly fast. 

So if you're lookin' for a place to chill & grab a burger & fries, intoxicating shake, light lunch or late-night bar food, I udderly recommend grazing at Holsteins. My ""fast-casual"" lunch with a drink still cost nearly $40 with tip. So don't go here expecting a cheap, quickie. Prices for burgers here range from $13 to $18 & if you're feelin' fancy get the ""Billionaire Burger"" for $32 made with Kobe Beef & foie gras. Virgin shakes are $9, while spiked shakes are $13, regular fries are $5, SPF are $6, and salads & apps range from $10 to $18. Udder yelpers complained about the prices at Holsteins, yeah it's not Steak & Shake people! If you're here, there's really no udder choice! But really, ya can't beat convenience or mooey-gemlicious, Americana food when you're stayin' & playin' in The Cosmo!",44,35,39

The shakes are really good and I think taste a lot better than those at GR. But the ""spiked"" aspect is just a gimmick. There's virtually no alcohol. In fact id say that they can legally serve these shakes at an elementary school. Also should note that they are pricey at $13.

I was eyeing the turtle cheesecake shake, because who doesn't want to just drink a cheesecake with booze in it? My boyfriend and I were just in the mood for burgers so we ordered the Rising Sun, which had kobe beef with yam, teriyaki sauce, and tempura avocado and the Longhorn burger with brisket, BBQ sauce, and cole slaw.

The burger is one of the staples of American popular cuisine. The simple recipe allows for considerable creativity from the chef who's making it, and there are thousands of variations, from one end of the country to the other. And when done properly, there are few foods more delicious. 

Holsteins freshly made bad-ass burgers are made from the choicest cows (Kobe), organic toppings and freshest buns. 

This restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor near the escalators. The interior reminds of a new age diner with eager guests wanting to try these delicious alcoholic shakes and fancy exotic burgers. The restaurant seem very energetic and it was a full house. The waiters and waitress wore uniforms and all looked in sync. Our waitress Abigail payed close attention to us and we felt that her she went above and beyond for us. I had a yelp checking promo for a free beer and she took care of me right way. Nothing better then free beer. With service like that I can now see why that this place is always buzzing.

We started with an appetizer of Buffalo Chicken wings smothered in bright orange sauce. With each bite i could taste the strong flavor of the cayenne pepper and garlic. I don't prefer really hot wings but these were so good we couldn't stop until they were gone. 

For the main course, I decided to go with Gold Standard Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli for $18.50.  I order it medium rare and it came out looking and tasting amazing. The Sirloin was melt in your mouth good. With each and every bite getting the hints of the Goat cheese and the sweet organic greens the burger really was a work of art. My wife ordered The Rising Sun Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado for $18. This dish was made perfect. Such an intense flavor from the very expensive high quality Kobe beef and the Teriyaki glaze. It was mild and not to sweet like most American Teriyaki but just WOW! My wife made me try a little bite and after that one tiny little bite my tongue firing all the wonderful deep flavors to my brain. It was like I was mesmerized by that one bite. I wanted her burger so bad!!!  

It is true Chef Anthony Meidenbauer really knows how to build a burger fit for a King or a Queen.  We felt like King and Queen that night we had those fantastic exotic burger. I noticed on the menu they have whats called a Billionaire Burger which consists of Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo. Doesn't that just sound like amazing. I am imagining the wonderful flavor combos of my two favorite dishes combined into one. I didn't have the nerve to spend $35 but on my next visit I will for sure.

Overall its a great new burger concept and probably in the Top 10 Best Burger Restaurants. I will be returning soon and I will have my eye on that Billionaire Burger!

Hands down the best milkshake I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's Malted Banana Gelato, Peanut Butter Crisps, Frangelico and priced at $11. Whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. Genius. It is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by the booze. 

On to the grub. 
Starters: 
Philly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls with udder sauce $11 
They were alright, but could have used more seasoning. The meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. I did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. 

For the beef and fake beef selections we had: 
The Classic with Two Dollar Cheddar (ridiculous) $15 
Urth Burger with One Dollar Swiss $14 
New Delhi Chicken $14 
All served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. I ordered Ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the Monkey Shake. As far as the burgers go my burger was ordered Medium and came to me very well done. I ate one third of it. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. The veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. Pretty good. The Chicken burger could have been executed better. The chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. 

Overall I will absolutely be back because The Cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. The menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as Bull's Balls, Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Duck Confit Street Tacos. I will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!",6,3,5

Our hunger was ridiculous since we were being smart and didnt eat breakfast prior to going to the pool. 

Our main motivation to go was because it was close, and because after a night of bottle service, we were all craving GREASY food (i.e., burgers and fries). 

Upon being seated - we were given a bucket of popcorn with truffle salt on it ""compliments of the chef"". OH PUH-LEATHE!!! everyone gets em... it's like bread at other restaurants, only here its truffle popcorn. hahah. however, never having had ""truffle"" anything before - it was good. but i was also HELLA HUNGRY. so you coulda given me stale popcorn and i would probably still enjoyed it.

Two of us werent feeling adventurous and just ordered the regular burger and shoestring fries. I ordered provolone cheese on my burger, she ordered cheddar - but when the burgers came out, BOTH had a white cheese on em. I'm pretty sure BOTH were provolone, bc last i checked, cheddar cheese is orange and nowhere on the menu did it state ""white cheddar"". anyways, whatever, she let it go cuz we were starving. I have to say, though, the meat was really good and you can tell it was ""real meat"" - i mean it was ground beef, but still chunky... if that makes sense. anyways. the burgers are pretty big - served as 2 meals for me (i saved half for dinner) and i love super skinny crunchy shoestring fries. Overall - the burger was a burger nonetheless, and maybe it's my fault for not being adventurous and getting one of those special burgers, but i was too hungry to risk ordering something i wouldnt like. Nothing really to write home about other than the meat was of better quality than other burgers i've had. it's really hard to mess up a burger.

Another item my party ordered was the lobster mac and cheese. I only had a few bites but it was DELISH. however, for the price of the dish, i would have expected a slightly larger serving than what they gave. 

As for service - it could have been better. the girl only came by 4 times. once to take drink orders, once for our real order, once to check up on us, and once to give us our check. mind you, checking up on us once may be okay for some, but i hate ""hunting"" waiters\/waitresses down for refills. im a person who largely bases tips on refills because not having to ask for a refill to get one means that the waiter is being attentive and paying attention to you and your party. but maybe thats just me...",1,2,0

Desserts are creative too. I grabbed the Coffee and Donuts which sounds awfully normal. However, it was presented on a platter as a chocolate infused coffee with marshmallows served with gourmet donut holes filled with different flavored pastry cremes (like cardamom and cinnamon). SUPER tasty.

The Rising Sun burger was definitely a good start for me. The tangy teriyaki sauce contrasted well with the crispy yam and the deep fried tempura avocado.

The Rising Sun ($17) - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado

Of course I had to order a milkshake(the Black and White) and yes, then add my favorite ingredient to help elevate this shake to a whole new level: A Shot of Expresso. What makes this place better than Max Brenner, they give you the excess shake in the blender cup! The shake was so damn good! And they too have an oreo cookie shake!

Service was very attentive. But I'm not too happy about being charged an extra full drink for that expresso shot.

My mission was clearly a burger and a shake. But considering I only had a one sampling, I will definitely have to come back to try the other burgers and shakes ( hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). May have just found my milkshake spot alternative to Max Brenner. Definitely a great spot to meet for lunch or just watch the game in the lounge area or bar.

Server was very nice and attentive. She asked how we were doing couple times and she added avocado at last minute on my burger as requested. Very clean restaurant including bathroom.
I order a Rising Sun burger and Gold Standard burger. Both added avocado. Both burger were around $18 each, not bad price for a very upscale burger restaurant. My Rising Sun was delicious, crispy patty outside, tender and juicy inside. The sauce in the burger was AMAZING, a twist of Asian side and I loved it. I kept licking my fingers throughout the whole meal. My girlfriend's Gold Standard was good she said. Juicy and arugula on top makes it different.

I asked her which is more popular; the grasshopper shake or the banana monkey one (names might not be right) and she told me their both completely different....

The rising sun burger was alright. The teriyaki flavor was lost in the burger. The crispy yams, spicy mayo, tempura avocado, and spices on the burger overpowered the teriyaki sauce.

During the MLK weekend my friends and I entered a Dodgeball tournament in Sin City.  We rested and decided to go out to dinner. One of my friends heard and read great reviews of Holstein's and I am not to argue with a person that knows her food. When we finally arrive we are quickly seated to our table where our waitress (wish I knew her name) welcomed us and provided menus (like any restaurant would). What I enjoyed was the excellent customer service she provided and excellent knowledge of the preparation of the meals. 
I went for the Steakhouse burger because it looked simple, filling, and juicy (yes juicy). I do not remember what my friends orders, but let me continue. We ordered some onion rings which were very delicious. Crunchy, not burnt nor mushy. When our meal arrived I took some time to take in the smell and here is where I begin to drool over its scent. When I took a bite of that burger the follow filled my mouth. My palate were swimming with some much flavor of that first bite. Once I was finishing up that bite a burst of the crushed black peppers kicked in and I had to take another moment savoring that bite.  Most times we expect that first bite to be the only one that gives that satisfaction of a good meal, but not for me the taste continued and kept getting better and better. The bun held out quite well. I doubt it was because I was eating the food quick (which I was not), but it managed to hold its own and added to the steak.

Our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. He brought out free popcorn for us as starters. It tasted very interesting, like spicy BBQ...

I got the Rising Sun burger which was very delicious with the fried avocado inside! Every burger also comes with a side of fries. I had ordered sweet potato fries but they gave me the regular skinny fries instead. I didn't mind because they were nice and crispy but once I let them know about the mistake, they brought out the sweet potato fries immediately which was nice. I also ordered the Frozen Grasshopper which was one of their alcoholic milk shakes with peppermint and chocolate. It was also delicious and I could not taste the alcohol at all.

Tip: if you check-in on foursquare and show your server, they will give you a free pint of draft beer! (we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)

Overall it was a very nice experience. I loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant.

Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w\/ liquor at $11.

I ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w\/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.  

Unfortunately, the burger should have been called the ""Old Standard"", because it was a basic burger w\/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn't that big, didn't have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.

The ambiance was typical sports bar w\/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.

-hip environment. We only sat at the bar, as they were packed, but it seemed more fun there anyway.
-Unique\/bold ingredients on the menu. I love when a place isn't scared to try new things!
-Clear identity. It's good when you know what a place is about and they don't seem too schizophrenic when you open the menu.
-Tons of drinks to choose from!

We tried a few things and shared:
-Kalbi Beef Quesadilla: Not bad, but not blown away. Bear in mind, I had the filling only, so perhaps with the flavors of the tortilla, it'd be better.
-Shared the Steakhouse Burger: Crusted in black pepper with Holstein's creamy steak sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, WIld Mushrooms, and Swiss Cheese. Again, just ok. But, I think most burgers are 'just ok' to me now since I don't eat the bun.  The ingredients were good and put together well.  We also got a side of smoked bacon, which was nice.
-Jim G had two of the many, many, many beers and I tried their Spicy Bloody Mary with Pepper&CIlantro infused vodka. Pretty good.  

I wanted to try one of their many 'shakes,' full of sweet and alcohol-y goodness. But I felt the carbs were too much. I know one drunken night I'll stumble in there and order one. I'll report back =)

The food is intriguing and there's plenty more on the menu that I want to try; that factor makes me give a place a little more credit up front, since they've piqued my interest. They try to use organic products, and I'm a fan of that. And, lastly, Block 16 management group runs them; they're the same group that does Public House, which I really like too.

Burgers were tasty and offered a variety of toppings. I ordered the ""Hen House"", a burger topped with bacon and fried egg. Awesome.

Beer, beer, and more beer. There is a TON of craft beer available on tap and in bottles.

Located inside the Cosmo, Holstein serves some some burgers unlike anywhere else. To start off, the place looks awesome, I sure they spent alot of money here (as they did on everything in the Cosmo) and it shows. There is plenty of street art, anime style graphics, along that old-world leather feel in the dining area. Its definitely falls into the stylish chic category. Plus that giant cow by the entrance looks cool! 

Now for the food, its awesome. Everyone tries out the Gold Standard and for good reason - cheddar, arugula, garlic chive aoili all make for a awesome burger. My personal fave:  is the Rising Sun - juicy, perfectly cooked kobe beef burger with crispy yam, teriyaki glaze and spicy mayo, and tempura avocado!.

The shakes are delicious (they do have alcohol in em) with the best one being Drunken Monkey. All of the bamboozled shakes have alcohol but you can get virgin as well. Try one out, they are delicious!

But be warned ahead of time, its not cheap, nor quiet. For a burger, fries and shake you are easily going come out spending $30+. Come in on a monday or weekend and the place be packed and loud from everyone trying to get inside of Marquee.",7,4,6

My fellow Yelpers, you did not disappoint. My friend and I came here after reading reviews on Yelp. We always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. 

I had the Billionaire Burger, and yes, it is DEFINITELY worth the $28!! After California banned foie gras, I was heart broken. I didn't know when I will be able to eat it again, so when I saw the Billionaire Burger on the menu, I had to get it!

This burger is made with kobe beef, FOIE GRAS, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. This burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. I usually get cheese on my burgers, but I opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. If you absolutely need some cheese, I'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. 

When the burger was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. There was a HUGE piece of grilled foie gras on my burger. I was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, I was wrong. The foie gras was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. There was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! You definitely get the bang for your buck here. The burger came with a choice of shoestring fries (which I recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. 

Another tip. If you check in with Foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. I don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. 

For the service, it was just non existent. Our server took so long to take our orders. We sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. I think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. 

All in all, yes, I definitely felt like a Billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger I had in my life! I can't wait til I go to Vegas again.",3,0,0

So, during a much-needed trip to Las Vegas, I decided to stop in to Holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the City of Angels.

After winding my way through the Cosmopolitan Hotel past the Chandelier Bar, I spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the Holsteins logo. At the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. I opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because I felt like the seriousness with which I was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.

The cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but I knew that I wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. I chose the Tiramisu Milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. The milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. The tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, Patron Café, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. The shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. It was the perfect dessert.

I also ordered a Gold Standard Burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. My main complaint about the menu is that half of the burgers listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. So, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.

The burger I ordered was still great. It was cooked medium-rare when I requested medium, but I really don't care too much unless I catch salmonella and die. The patty was flavorful. The toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. I was delighted that the burger was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.

The waitress was fantastic. She helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. Both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which I appreciated very much because I could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.

The meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. You won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at Holsteins.

They even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. I could have cried. Oh, how I've missed Nevada, the land free from open container laws.",3,3,2

My burger was Kobe Beef glazed in Teriyaki sauce and topped with Furikake, and crispy yam that were shaved into long thin ribbons..I did take a picture but the photo turned out too dark. The burger was real lean, no dripping grease, but lacking in the seasonings for my taste.  I did like it but just the burger by itself was a just a bit bland for me. Mr.B  approved the Longhorn burger.  It was their beef burger with beef brisket.  

Also a winner was the Crispy Pork Belly Buns in the Little Buns (aka sliders) section.  The buns were pressed Chinese buns. The pork belly skin was crisp and the meat was tender.  I was very pleased with the hoisin sauce that topped it. Mildly sweet and a good complement for the pork belly. 

Servings were big..and so were the prices, but well worth the expense. Ambiance wise, casual although the front lobby area is really LOUD.  I couldn't hear even myself talk! Nor anyone else for that matter. I don't know how their hostesses handle repeating themselves all day long.  Our servers were did great for being super busy that evening.

There are so many restaurants on the strip, how do you choose?! Yelp of course! Do your research, bookmark a bunch of places, then try as many as you can! This is how I roll on vacations and it's turned out pretty good so far!

Looking at burger places in Las Vegas, this one immediately caught my eye because of their ""bamboozled shakes"" made with alcohol. Sign me up!  Their innovative takes on the classic burger and fries made this choice a no brainer. 

The restaurant is located on the second floor above the casino level neighboring their retail shops. We were immediately greeted and given a choice if he lounge or the dining room. The noise level in the lounge was a little too high for our liking, but this area would be great if you're coming off the casino floor just to have their shakes. 

FOOD: Everything we tried was foodgasmic!! The poutine had a soy sauce-tasting gravy that was made from a stout beer cooked down and reduced to perfection. My burger wasn't over cooked, the tempura avocado gave the burger the creaminess it needed to balance the spicy aoli and the teriyaki sauce. So good! The shakes are so decadent! I normally don't advise sharing, but this is the one exception.  Share! Check out my pictures and you'll see why. 

SERVICE: This is where I think Holsteins has some opportunities to better their business. Our server was nice, she gave her recommendations (fried pickles, fat boy shake) and was quick in giving us our drinks. After seeing other diners with their bucket of popcorn on their tables even before they ordered, we had to ask our server for ours after our appetizer came out. Towards the end of the meal she disappeared and some random bus boy with a broom and dustpan brought our check to our table. Wth?! After our shakes, our server only refilled one of our glasses of water, leaving the other three empty. What gives?! 

Overall the food outweighed the spotty service. We will definitely be back!",1,0,1

I ordered the Carbonara Chicken burger with Grilled Chicken Breast, Bacon, Mushrooms, Sweet Pea Aioli, Fried Egg, and Provolone Cheese.

We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry. 

After eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. 

Fast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I'm upset so I complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. 

The service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, ""Well, you guys sure got a late seat"". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's Miller Lite didn't come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn't inquire about our food. He didn't open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. 

The food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. As someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing.",2,0,0

I must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. 

First, the food: My trusty companion and I each had a burger. I had the flagship ""Gold Standard"" and she had the ""El Machete"". 

The Gold Standard is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar and arugula. This should be delicious, and I assume if seasoned properly it is. Unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... I LOVE SALT - which left the Gold Standard feeling merely Standard. 

My Tardis companion had the ""El Machete"" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. This was actually delicious from the two bites I had. If there was any seasoning issue with the burger itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!

Along with that we had regular fries and sweet potato fries. The fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. The sweet potato fries were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. 

We also had milkshakes. Hers being some fruit compote Fourth of July special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. Mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (I had asked for chocolate ice cream but I wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)

As we left, I thought ""unspectacular... but worth a second look"".  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I figured that I might try it again when next in town. 

Not long after my companion and I started feeling sour in our stomachs. Come dinner time, still sour... I have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. Even as I write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.

We tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. It literally went into the box the same way it came to the table. 

I really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. I would like to think this is an isolated incident in which I suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. 

I really wanted to like this place. The menu is creative.  The decor is attractive. There are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  Unfortunately, I went from ""looking forward to eating there"" to ""pondering a second chance"" to ""likely not looking forward to a future visit""... 

If not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way I feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. So in fairness, I decided to average the two opinions. 

All in all a very disappointing visit. Thank god for Pepto.",1,0,0

   I was told to try the buffalo chicken dip but couldn't really see myself eating it, so I opted for the ""Philly"" egg rolls and ahi poke tostadas. The egg rolls, although non-traditional, are my new favorite! If I am ever craving a Philly cheesesteak I would choose these over a messy sandwich any day! The ahi poke tostadas were good, nothing out of this world. The tostada was nice and crispy and the avocado aioli was perfectly portioned for each serving. I am used to fresh-off-the-boat Florida seafood so I guess I should give Vegas a little slack in that department considering you can't catch tuna in the middle of the desert.

   Since I wasn't incredibly hungry I ordered the dulce de leche swirl cheesecake to go. I ended up having this for breakfast the next morning so I most definitely enjoyed the corn flakes garnish. As an added touch, they put the caramel sauce and corn flakes in little side containers so my cheesecake would be fresh and not soggy.

+ The pork belly is PERFECTLY cooked. Crispy on the outside (a little bit of burnt so you can taste the smokiness!), and extremely tender inside.
+ Fresh cilantro and herb complements, with jalapenos on the side for those non-spicy eaters!
+ Hoisin sauce is a must! XOXO
+ LOVED the buns! Although it was thick, it complemented all the ingredients and didn't leave you feeling that you just ate too much dough
+ It was NOT dripping with oil!!! I'm in Vegas, so I don't want to feel more bloated from anything else (except from the alcohol of course), and surprisingly, this didn't make me feel disgusting afterwards!

House music was blasting.

The DJ was spinning.

Girls in stilettos and slinky dresses were dancing.

Boys in button-down shirts were standing and posing by the bar while sipping Manhattans.

You'd be forgiven for thinking that I had just wandered into some Vegas nightclub, but no.  This atmosphere is par for the course at Holsteins, which may be the most self-consciously hip burger joint in America.

Normally I'd be more cynical about the goings-on at Holsteins, but they're forgiven because they put out an excellent product.  Despite the crowds and clubby atmosphere, the hostess quickly found us a (relatively) quiet table in the corner, with a nice view of a staff artist making a new cow-themed painting to add to the dining room's already-extensive collection.  After we sat down, we knew we made the right decision by coming here, because absolutely everything on their menu is mouthwatering.  

Holsteins has a pretty extensive menu, but ordering anything other than the burgers would be silly here.  I ordered the nom nom burger, which is Kobe beef, cheddar, Thousand Island dressing, and potato chips.  My dinner companion had their California turkey burger, which comes with sprouts, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepper Jack cheese, and a dollop of Russian dressing.  All of the burgers come with your choice of shoestring or steak-cut fries.

I *loved* the flavors of both of these burgers.  They easily rank among the best in Vegas.

The only place where Holsteins slips is service.  I asked for my burger cooked medium, and it was definitely cooked beyond that.  Ultimately, though, the Thousand Island dressing provided more than enough the juiciness for the burger.  My dinner companion also ordered steak fries, but received shoestring fries instead.  Again, this was a tiny problem that didn't affect our experience much.

Holsteins definitely warrants a return visit.  I'll let their scattershot service slide, if it means tasting more of their meaty and mouthwatering creations in a sleek and stylish atmosphere.

This used to be my go-to burger place in town before BurGR. I really like the ambiance in this place as it's usually full and loud. My kind of place. I guess trendy environments appeal to me.

I am a creature of habit when it comes to food. Although I consider myself a foodie, I stick to what I like and hardly ever try anything else. When at Holsteins I always order their California Turkey Burger (sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepperjack cheese, Russian dressing) with a side of fries. At first I wasn't too sure about the Russian dressing, but I really liked how all the flavors came together once biting into it. I usually find places making my Turkey Burgers too dry, however, that wasn't the case here. It was cooked to perfection and very juicy even though I requested well-done. The only negative I find in their burgers is that they are messy. I personally prefer my food stay together and not having to finish my burgers with a fork. That would be the only reason I dropped them one-star. My wife usually gets their Fun-Ghi Burger (beef patty topped w\/ forest mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese, frissee, & truffle mayo). She's more adventurous than I am, but this is by far her favorite.

Although I think it's weird, I like that they serve you complimentary seasoned popcorn. I think they do this to make you thirsty so that you can order one of their many Shake selections. Regardless, the popcorn tastes very good and is a nice touch nonetheless.

You MUST also try their Liquid Nitrogen Desserts. This item isn't on the menu, but it is a rather neat experience if you've never tried it. We get this every time because it feels funny in your mouth. You know what doesn't feel funny in your mouth? Well, that's for you to figure out. Seriously though, I don't know how exactly to describe it other than a lot of smoke comes out of your mouth and nose and it's very, very cold.

I ordered the Urth burger- the patty itself wasn't the greatest. It was okay as far veggie patties go, but seasoning wise...meh. The toppings were amazing though. The Urtha burger came with avocado, sprouts, TWO slices of tomato, lettuce and cucumber. I added Provalone cheese, but the list if options was pretty good (read: egg, salmon,  brisket, cheeses etc). 

My husband ordered the Nom Nom Burger medium, seemed slightly rarer than medium, so order up of your usual. He added and over easy egg toping and found it quite delicious.

my husband got the SMORES shake & he couldnt stop talking about how good it was!

shakes were made with vodka that we couldnt taste at all. no after effect either so they must have used a minimal amount which was probably a good thing.

My friends and I had come to eat here as we were waiting to check in to our room yesterday. It took about 15 minutes to get our waters. I ordered the ahi poke tostadas as an appetizer. There was an overwhelming taste of lime and cilantro that took over each bite and they were served on stale chips. For my entree, I got the El Machete burger. It was honestly just okay... The bottom bun was a bit soggy which made it difficult to eat with my hands without everything falling out of the burger. The best part of my experience was the fries (which were pretty good, I'll give them that). We were all pretty fed up and wanted to leave rather quickly. then it took a while to get our check which I couldn't understand because I looked around the restaurant and the place wasn't even half full.

For us Angelinos who don't have anymore foie gras, this is just another reason to visit Vegas (though I did hear that a loophole is restaurants can serve it in Ca, they just can't charge for it - i.e., order of hamburger with a complementary slab of fg). It's $28 with a side order of fries and well worth it.  I got the shoestring fries and thought it was a good choice.

Then my friend said, you know, you should really go to Holsteins and try their Asian burger because it's friggin awesome.  Well, I just happened to be in the Cosmo without having eaten a meal all day.  And I love burgers, so why the hell not?

Three trips later, this spot has reached rare territory for me: mandatory trip every time I go to Vegas (which seems to happen at least once a month, so this is going to be a very fruitful partnership!).  On an overall basis, top 10 burgers lifetime.  Generally, the flavors of each burger and balanced very well.  Nothing is overpowering the meat, which is of excellent quality.  The ingredients they use are fresh.

As for the burgers themselves?  The aforementioned Asian burger, aka the Rising Sun, was definitely something quite unique.  Crispy yam, a massive tempura-fried avocado, and kobe beef?  I just want to eat it again, but I feel like I need to try all the other burgers on the menu too.  Well, that would have to be the Billionaire Burger.  And pretty much, you had me at foie gras on a burger.  Last burger I've had was the Steakhouse Burger.  While not on the same level as the previous two, I was not disappointed whatsoever.  Just look at the dripping cheese on that picture I posted on it, how can you not fall in love with it?

Other items...where else can I get country fried bacon?  Deep fried bacon?  Seriously, stop tempting my heart!  The fries are ok, certainly get the job done.  Onion rings are fried perfectly, it's worth it to get them as as sub.

Even for the standard Vegas premium for pricing, it's not obscenely outrageous.  In fact, it's almost impossible to find anything on the Strip that is even remotely good value for money.  Simply put, Holsteins is awesome food in an awesome hotel.  And it is perfectly placed...came here once after raging all day at Marquee Dayclub.

Another concept restaurant from Block 16 Hospitality that has generated raves since its inception at The Cosmopolitan I'd frequently entertained a visit to Holsteins but it was not until nearly three and a half years after first visiting the property that I finally sat down for lunch, a $130 meal for two at a casual 'shakes and buns' place rather absurd in retrospect even though much of the experience was admittedly quite good.  Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new ""Un-Birthday"" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.",7,1,5

I get it that these are some expensive burgers... but they are also very VERY delicious! This IS Vegas, and for Vegas I thought the price was pretty reasonable.

I had the Tenderloin Rossini under the Tiny Buns section.  They were two mini burgers of BEEF MEDALLION WITH FOIE GRAS, WILD MUSHROOM, ARUGULA AND TRUFFLE MAYO.  It was so good... It was a perfect portion too!

Other burgers that I recommend are the Rising Sun and Duck Duck Goose.

It's casual, its comfortable, and definitely a perfect place to go to if you want to avoid bougie and expensive restaurants on the strip.  I thought the service was great... I'm sure other people had different experience with the service depending on what server they got, but ours was very nice :)",4,3,3

I got the Nom Nom burger, and it was pretty plain, honestly.  The bun and beef were so darn good that I enjoyed it a lot though.  They had some good draft beers there and they honored the 50% Off on draft beers for checking in on Yelp.  So there is that!

The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.

I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w\/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.

There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalapeño, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.

The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.

I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.

Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table.\/  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  A note to the parents--leave the damn Webster's Elementary Dictionary in the room.  You don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.

A pleasant meal.",8,7,5

Leaving somewhat unfulfilled from our day at the Marquee Dayclub, my friends and I decided to roll over to Holstein's for some shakes.  In all honesty, the trip was mainly to satisfy our munchies and I am glad that the milkshakes, at least, were good.  It seems like a lot of other reviews rave about the burgers which may be a reason why I was underwhelmed.  Here are some of the things that we tried:

Ahi Poke Tostadas- Although beautifully presented, these bite size tostada pieces were just okay and I would not recommend.  Sure there is some avocado aioli that goes well with the ahi but for me it was on the bland side.  The only source of heat came from the piece of jalapeno which was a little too strong of a flavor profile to enjoy the meat.

Buffalo Chicken Dip - I can handle my spice, but it was slightly spicier than I would like and definitely required the dip to help with the heat.  If you are looking for something spicy, this would be it.

Natural Cut Fries\/Sweet Potato Fries - These were cooked well but were nothing special.

Buttermilk Onion Rings - Their buttermilk onion rings were probably one of the best I have had.  The coating was nice and crispy and inside was a hot well cooked piece of onion in the middle.  Of all the sides, I would recommend these.

Milkshakes - If there was another thing that I really enjoyed were the milkshakes  I had the Black and White which was rich and creamy with a nice balance of chocolate and vanilla.  What I was surprised was that that they not only have the nicely presented milkshake in one glass and another cup with the leftover.  My friend also got the alcoholic ones and they are deceptive!  He got a major hangover afterwards so beware!

Another plus here was the service.  My pretty big group of friends were seated pretty quickly and the waitress we had was super friendly and attentive even on a fairly busy day.  Holstein's is located on the floor with most of the restaurant.

Overall, Holstein's has okay food but has nice milkshakes that are worth trying if that's what you are in the mood for.  However, I am willing to come back to try their burgers.",3,1,2

What made this place PERFECT was that I had my birthday dinner here for a group of 31.  The staff accommodated every single one of us...including 2 children.  For being 2 weeks old, I was VERY impressed that the staff never missed a beat.
As far as food goes...I had the Lobster Roll and the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. The Lobster Roll was amazing...almost like I was in Boston.  The Lobster Mac n' Cheese was also very good, but the most impressive part about the dish was the tiny bite size Lobster BLT served to the side.  It has so much flavor you want more.
I was able to try some of the shakes, but one that stood out was the Campfire S'more.  I just remember the tastiness of the shake...then the warm sensation of the alcohol going down my throat.  What I like better was the malt.
Everyone in my group was too full for dessert, however, the staff brought out the Candy Shop item off the menu in celebration for my birthday.  The only way I can describe it is that it had an interesting array of flavors and textures.

Well, the hamburgers are good, assuming you get your servers attention  ever again after putting in a drink order.  Then you wait and other servers bring your food.

The wait time for the burger is quite long although we were sat down fairly quickly. Unfortunately, I was not pleased with the popcorn that they served us in the beginning. It is really to fill you up so that you don't expect too much out of the burger...

The sizes of the burgers are not generous at all. That is okay to me though, since I am all about the quality and I indeed ordered the Kobe Beef which SHOULD BE the best in the house. As I chowed down into the burger, I was not satisfied. For a burger, it was phenomenal, but for a KOBE BEEF burger, this wasn't that good. The size was not large, the quality for what it really should be was not up to par. 

Finally, we ended off with a tasty shake which really made the meal okay. Holstein's is not bad it is not great, but it is acceptable.

AMBIANCE: It's definitely casual, but feels a lot more like an upscale diner. The wall prints are colorful and interesting.

A few years back when the Cosmo opened, I went here and ordered a burger. OMG- it was delicious. Being a local, I always wanted to return here but it's such a bitch to park and navigate through City Center.  Yesterday however, I really had a craving for a Holstein's burger and took my wife there for a night out on the town.  I arrived at the host stand the girl was very friendly. She told me that the dining room wait time is about 45 minutes but there is a full menu at the bar  if we can find a seat. Well right in front of us there were 2 empty seats.   Mike at the bar, greeted us right away and reviewed the menu with us pointing out the signature burger. I had some specific requests for my burger and so did my wife. I reiterated to him to make sure that the burgers were prepared as I requested them.  Since my wife asked for her burger to be well-done, he said that the wait time for the burger would be 25 minutes.  Fifteen minutes later our burgers arrived.  They were prepared properly and Mike checked back in with us to refill our drinks and ask how things were.  The person next to me ordered a shake and I asked Mike about that drink. He described the drink and I ordered it.  The shake was delicious!! Too bad that the amount of alcohol in the shake was less than expected. I should have asked for another shot.

The adult shakes are incredible espicaly the orange creamsicle (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a root beer float with pop rocks and rum).  

The food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new American fusion.  You are rewarded for being adventurous.  

The ""Street Tacos"" are made from duck confit, foie gras cranberry relish.  They are incredible.  Other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. The crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  Served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.

Meat in a tube is well represented.  Try the Greek touri.  Different but very flavorful.

Finally, the burgers.  Although I'm still partial to the Burger Bar, Holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  Cooked perfectly to order.  The ""Rising Sun"" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.

Service is fast and efficient.

The burger that won the award is overrated. It's not bad, but I wouldn't get it again. The Korean Burger was great, and the Japanese Burger was equally as great. Sorry if this wasn't much help because of the gross lack of details. 

To be honest, if you don't have to sit down, I would recommend Secret Pizza over this place. But the burgers are good.",2,0,1

We came for lunch on a Saturday. There was about a 25 min wait, but given that it is a popular place, we expected that. We each ended up getting cocktails (not the milkshakes). My friend loved her Bloody Mary, and I thought that the XXX was fine, nothing to rave over. Drinks ranged from $10-$13. 

We split the lobster mac & cheese (I believe it was $16). It was a pretty small portion, and I found it to be underseasoned. You could see the lobster in there, so that was a good thing. 

I had the Chicken Carbonnera sandwich, while she had the Gold Standard burger. We were both pleased. My chicken was juicy, I loved the bun and the egg on top, as well as the bacon.  We both liked the steak fries (you have a choice of shoestring or steak cut) as well. Portions were about average- not tiny, but you won't leave feeling like you're bursting out of your pants, either.

From there I had the Captain hook (Grilled atlantic salmon w\/ frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax) which was excellent. I ordered the salmon medium and it came out a little closer to medium welll, yet it was still flaky and amazing. The combination of flavors in this sandwich are crazy! The house cured gravlax...WOW. Service was pretty quick considering the Final 4 was on and the place was packed. I'd actually recommend making reservations before coming because this place is always packed.

The good (not great):
Truffle lobster mac n cheese-God, I'm such a sucker, but who can seriously screw this up.  
Tom turkey mini burgers - good flavor, but better served as a whole burger to avoid the dry factor, as ours were. 

The bad:
Lobster ""corn dogs"" - again, we fell victim to fat kid food verbage and were duped into these $16 appetizers.  They were lobster tails (small ones at that, and maybe not even whole tails, but lobster meat) dipped in tempura batter and served as a pair.  Yup, those are a definite pass.
Duck fat fries - eh.  Regular old fries to me.  The kettle chips were way better. 

The ugly:
Ok, nothing was really that bad. Just not that great. The menu is a little busy and there are definitely a few things they could get rid of.

This place is situated inside the Comopolitan at City Center, it sits right across from the Chandelier room (?) and from Tao. The atmosphere is very modern, hip, trendy.  The server we had was awsome. She was very attentive to a larger group (we had 12 peeps) and patient with us.

On to the food: I had the fried pickles appetizer,  ""Rising sun"" burger with shoestring fries and ""Midas touch"" beer. The fried pickles were good, they bread and deep fried a regular size pickle that is sliced lengh-wise with the bomb ass dipping sauce (forgot what it was called). Burger = I had mine done medium, and it came out perfectly with T-L-O (tomato-lettuce-onions) you really can't describe in words how good this gourmet hamburger was other than to say, its on my list of top 3 hamburgers I've eaten. I really wanted to limit what other ingredients that made up the hamburger itself.  I wanted to taste the Kobe beef, and yes, please believe, all thats been said about Kobe beef.  The house made bread, I think, was the perfect ingredient to the hamburger, it was fresh, not too ""doughy"". The shoestring fries was ""eehh"" only thing that saved the fries was the dipping sauce I had leftover from the appetizer. It was more of an afterthought.

Beer = I could have gotten another one of these, Its made by Dogfish and it was really good. It really complimented my meal.

I got the golden standard, which is bacon cheeseburger. The twist being goat cheese, arugula and a tomato confit.  These additions take my favorite burger to a different level. 

The placed offered us a choice between table side and more informal ""lounge"" seating. Lounge seating is couch and chairs you pull up yourself. We had a table of 6 and This was definitely the quicker option. We had a genuinely a good time. A bit more difficult to eat at but unless you're using a knife and fork, it's pretty great spot to have a large group.  

Kenya was our server and she was very good to us. Especially dealing with the many changes we had in our initial drink order. 

A fully stocked bar. We had a round of Vegas bombs (new to all of us) and several beers and jäger bombs.  

The burgers were amazing. Such a great combo. Everyone was happy with their choices. Mine was a complete burger. The goat cheese and bacon played really well with the burger. I was pleasantly surprised. Burger came with fries. Pretty standard fries, I think double fried.

We had a good time, staff was very helpful. I'll definitely put this burger in my top 5 in Vegas.",0,0,0

There are so many places to get a good burger, but a great burger AND a shake?! Yeah, Holsteins Shakes & Buns at the Cosmopolitan is the spot. Located on the second floor right off the escalators, look for the cutest cows. The decor at Holsteins is really eye-catching and cute. According to one of the servers, they just changed the artwork last week. (Check some out, I took photos.) There's a bar in the front and the restaurant is located towards the back. 

Right after you are seated, you are treated to delish popcorn with cajun seasoning. Seriously, nom nom nom....I could've eaten it all and then some. But, I knew I had to save room for my shake and burger. Hubby and I decided to share a shake and a burger since we didn't want to be stuck with leftovers. That was a good choice because for $9, you get a quality size shake and the extras (that don't fit in the cup). We ordered a vanilla shake that just might have been the most delish shake I've ever had. It was topped with a lot of whipped cream and these tiny pearl balls that were so yummy. We decided on the FUN-ghi burger ($17) which is a beef patty topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, frisee, and truffle mayo. Every burger comes with fries and they were yummy! The burger was juicy, messy, and flavorful - but not sure it was worth the $17. (I figured it was hotel food so, hence, the jacked up price.)

Overall, service, atmosphere, and the food were awesome. I would give this place 4 and a half stars, but rounded it up for Yelp purposes. (Gotta take into consideration that it's a food place in a fancy hotel and on the Strip, so you know you are gonna have to pay a premium for food.)

When presented with a burger voted Vegas's best, it's hard to consider anything else.  I went with the Gold Standard Burger and wasn't disappointed.  Sweet Potato fries were another plus. To top things off I ordered one of the ""boozy milkshakes"", going with the Oreo and Bailey's version (I wasn't adventurous enough to go for the Captain Crunch).

For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.

Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.

Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean ""Bull""Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.

Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.

The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.

My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.",23,17,24

      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.

Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.

Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.

Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.

 *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? 
       Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.

Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.

*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
      Ah, hit the spot.

Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Créme Brûlée, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.

Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.

Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, Holsteins seems to be the place to eat here.  A friend and I stopped in before a show.  On the weekends they do not take reservations.  Good thing it wasn't too busy so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated.  While waiting in their lounge area, it was very very loud.  Almost too hard to carry on a conversation with someone sitting right next to me.  I was keeping my fingers a crossed for a quieter dining area.  

More quiet? Not so much.  Still a little loud but we powered through.  Service wasn't too shabby.  We were checked on frequently during our meal with drinks always refilled. 

I tried their California Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had a good flavor with avocado, cucumber slaw, spouts and a Russian dressing.  Pretty tasty.  The fries were also good but a little too much salt.  

Amazing shakes... Indeed.  I had the pecan turtle cheesecake shake.  Yum.  Cheesecake, pecans, dark chocolate pieces, caramel sauce and stoli salted caramel vodka.  I fell in love.  So good.

It looked great on the plate, burger was nice and thick, wasn't dry, condiments seemed fresh.  My guest really like the onion rings, but I found they had too much bread.   Crunchy and crisp, but the onion to bread ratio was off.  For only an extra $2, for the rings, that's not bad. There shakes are always good.

Our table was wobbly, so being a designer in for the Hospitality Expo, I was a little po'd at this since everything else in this hotel is exquisitely designed. But, won't knock off points for that.

The food: ordered the ""Nom nom"" burger...Kobe beef burger with cheese. It didn't come with lettuce, tomatoes, etc., but they're available for the asking. Overall, very good...not as melt-in-your-mouth as the kobe burger at one of Wolfgang Puck's restuarants, but tasty none the less. Got it with steak fries...again, good, but about the same as what you could get at say Fuddruckers or KFC; nothing special, but still good.

Service: Good. We could tell our server was either tired or just tired of working in Vegas, but at least she still made an effort to smile. Another server who accidentally poured water into my 1\/2 empty Sprite glass was better and more fun. We all laughed, she realized her ""super fail"" (as she exclaimed), apologized and provided me with extra soda and popcorn...which had me thinking, ""why didn't our main server give us popcorn when we first sat down??""  Again, neither here nor there.

For the guys(& maybe some of you ladies): the servers in the bar area...wow. Very hot asian ladies in tight red mini-dresses?! Take that, Hooters!

Overall, a nice casual place to eat amongst the swankier places in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely better than some of the other burger offerings in Vegas. Guys, if your girl doesn't wanna leave ""The Chandelier"" bar, just go up and have a burger & watch the game at Holsteins! You're welcome.",2,0,1

Our taxi driver suggested it when my girlfriend was craving chicken wings. We all did need a base layer before a hectic night out on the strip. Normally, if someome suggests a joint, I am left with limited things I tend to eat. I stood corrected in this case.
We found the restaurant easily and were greeted by several friendly hostesses. The decor is funky and modern with strange pictures of pickle-people and cows. We sat at an oversized booth and as I started to look at the menu, I found my savior: The Urth Burger. That's right folks, a vegan burger. 
My party got a few orders of chicken wings, a Caesar salad, Ahi tostadas and I ordered the Urth burger with sweet potato fries. 
Warren was our server and he was friendly and very hospitable. Thanks to Yelp! I found out flavored rums were $4. The girls ordered a few cocktails and C and I stuck with waters. 
We peppered Warren with questions about the area and tattoo parlors and he tried his best to help us. He did seem moderately overwhelmed so we were forgiving of his mild forgetfulness. 
Our food came out and the presentation was gorgeous! My burger was massive and absolutely amazing. The patty had a perfect blend of spices to be flavorful, yet not overpowering and it was popped with a generous portion of avocado, sprouts, tomato and lettuce. It is definitely a veg heads burger! The drinks came out shortly after the food, which was a little unopportunistic but that is okay.
I would love to give this place 5 stars, but the pace of dining is what killed it. I loved Warren as a server and it is not like we were in a massive hurry, but over 15 minutes for drinks from the time we ordered and about 8 minutes for our bill knocked it down a star.

This place is right in the ""stores"" area across from the day club. But once you get in, it doesn't feel that way. The wait for a table was about a half hour, so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. 

Ordered the Holsteins Special Lager, which is made right here in Las Vegas. Beers here are moderately priced... Served in either 16oz or 12oz. The tap list is pretty solid. I'd say about 20 beers on tap at once. I think they could make a killing if they do beer flights, but they do not offer that at this time. Also, maybe provide beer and burger pairings? The beer I got (which was the cheapest on tap besides Miller Lite) was not bad. Definitely a ""light craft beer"". But hey, beer is beer right? And I'm sure it will go nicely with the burger I got. 

Got the ""Nom Nom Burger"" which comes with cheese, potato chips, and 1000 islands dressing. Not a fan of the dressing, so I subbed that out for some bacon which was an extra 2 bucks. Also upgraded to the onion rings because I heard great things about those. Got the food. Looks great. Onion rings are nice and crispy, which is exactly what I was looking for.

We ate here last night (Sept 2015) and our burgers were really unimpressive. I ordered the Billionaire Burger, which is their priciest burger (double the price of the others) the Kobe beef patty i ordered medium rare but it was really dry and unimpressive, seemed like bland ground beef. My girlfriend ordered the Nom Nom which is also Kobe Beef, her's was cooked pink (as mine should have been) but was still pretty dry & unimpressive overall. I probably should have sent back my burger since it was clearly overcooked, but we were with another couple and I hate to be the guy who sends back food and then my food comes out like 15 min after everyone is already done eating. 

As a note, I still ate the entire burger, it wasn't inedible at all. My sentiment is when you're paying $32 for a hamburger you'd hope they'd nail it and impress. Maybe I had too high hopes for the restaurant after hearing that it was better than Umami Burger.

I recently went to visit this location on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino. They do accept OpenTable reservations, so i decided to make a reservation. I was fortunate that I did because the restaurant seating did fill up on a Wednesday. I decided to order the Urth (vegan) burger as it was the cheapest burger on the menu. I redeemed my free 10oz Holstein's lager check-in and enjoyed it while eating the complimentary spiced popcorn. I had about 1.5 buckets worth and really enjoyed it a little too much, but maybe I was hungry.

I did try my friends' alcoholic and non-alcoholic shakes. Unfortunately, their ""world-famous"" shakes haven't made it around to Las Vegas because I would settle for a Sonic or In-n-out shake compared to theirs. It was beautifully presented, and they did give you the extra remaining cup; however, it was just a-ok. Nothing special about it. I will mention that my friend did order the chocolate shake with double shots, and the alcohol taste was barely a semblance in the drink. I would recommend finding your alcohol elsewhere. 

The good thing about this location is that you can mix and match your burger with added cheeses and sauces, so you can order a Vegan burger on a different burger style in the menu. I did not opt for cheese, but I did opt for the aioli and spicy ranch with my fries. Without the sauces, the burger would not have been flavorful. I will compliment the vegan burger for not having any tree nuts or peanuts in the burger (as claimed by the waitress) and if there were any, then I didn't taste it.

The Gold Standard is a dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. The tomato confit was overpowering. Couldn't taste the garlic-chive aioli. It just tasted like tomato. Maybe I'm not a tomato fan? Maybe I'm a bit too harsh of a critic? The burger was good, but not a wow factor. Maybe next time I'll hold the tomato confit and add mushrooms instead. A plus for this place is that it is a large restaurant. Went on a really busy Vegas weekend and didn't have to wait for a table.

Preach.  So I've been wanting to try Holstein's for a while and on my most recent trip to Vegas, we popped in for dinner.  Although I was eyeing the adult milkshakes, being lactose intolerant had me looking the other way.  I didn't want the test my luck that night, even with a purse full of Lactaid.  You only live once but I rather not spend it in a day of agony.  TMI?  Too bad.  This is my review so suck it, Trebek.  

This gastropub is brightly lit and adorable with all the cow motifs.  The artwork is cute as heck and the food is amazing.  Upon being seated, they bring you free flavored popcorn.  I'm not a big popcorn person but it had me reaching for popcorn after popcorn!  I had me the Urth Burger [House Made Vegan Patty With Lettuce, Tomato, Cucumber, Sprouts & Avocado] and my dinner companion, the cutiepie Matt C., had the Nom Nom Burger [Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing].  Although I was hella craving for some vegetables, one bite of the Nom Nom Burger had me jealous.  It was juicy, cheesy, and so dang flavorful.  I also like the bite of the chips in the Nom Nom Burger.  As I passed Matt his burger back, I could only look down at my veggie burger with disappointment.  Dang it!  He got the fries and I got onion rings with our burgers and we shared them.  Both of these little munchies made for an excellent leftover midnight snack as well!

It was topped with Tempura Avocado, Spicy Mayo, Crispy Sweet Potatoes, Furikake & Teriyaki Glaze...can you say yum??! My burger was cooked to medium perfection and it came with a side of thick, seasoned wedge fries. 

I love the variety on the menu as well. This place boasts Spiked Milkshakes, DIY Burgers, Mini Hotdogs, Chicken & Waffles and many different burger creations. I was torn between my Kobe Beef Burger and the ""Big Fat Greek"" which was a Lamb Burger topped with Feta & Tzatziki sauce, mmmm!

I've been to the Holstein's in Costa Mesa, which is apparently the newer and fancier version of this one. The menu is much more different at this location, as is the food. The fries here were terrible, stale and under-seasoned.

I never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  Finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat ""short"" wait of 40 minutes, I got to try Holsteins.

It actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, I went with the Gold Standard, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  I ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  What really caught my attention about the Gold Standard was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  Out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the Kobe beef burgers!

The toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  You can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  The garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  Besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the Gold Standard is really a burger that's up there in the burger world.  It's just a very tasty burger and I can see why it is so popular!

I also tried a bit of the Rising Sun, as well as the Korean Bull-gogi.  The Rising Sun is more of an Asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of the burger.  It also has a Kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  I would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.

As for the Korean Bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  The best part is definitely the fried egg that sits on top.  Who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??

Out of all the fries, I liked the steak cut fries the most.  Crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  Onion rings were great as well.  The shoestring fries were a little stale to me.

Now, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the Black Cow Float and the Frozen Grasshopper.  Black Cow Float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a true shake.  It even comes with pop rocks!  The Frozen Grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  Smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  For both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!

They also have a bunch of beers on draft.  The Bosteels Triple Karmeliet is a good one!

Price-wise, it is pricey.  Our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  The price should reflect great service but I found the service a bit lacking.  Our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.

After our meal, I can see why so many people like the burgers at Holsteins.  Can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!",2,0,2

I had the chance to try the Korean burger as well as the Smokehouse burger.  The korean burger is freakin money.  It was juicy, flavorful, and satisfying.  I definitely licked my chops after eating a piece of this burger.  The smokehouse burger was good, however, the meat of the burger is a little bit too lean (I don't believe I've ever said that in my life about a burger).  I guess this is also a pro because it was one of the cleanest burgers I've ever eaten.  Not even a drop of meat juice dripped while I ate this burger.  It could come off dry to some, but it was still very tasty.  If you're going to be wearing all white like a player, get this burger.

 Tess was great, she was super friendly and made sure everything was going good when we got our food, after we had started eating and then before we left. She got our orders correct and got our shakes out to us quickly.
I had the Gold Standard burger & the Frozen Grasshopper shake. 
Tess explained the Gold Standard as 'basically a bacon cheeseburger but with better ingredients' which was a spot on comparison. The patty was thick and had plenty of melted goat cheddar cheese on top, they were also very generous with the baby arugula on the burger which I liked.

I was a little disappointed with the shake, only because I couldn't really taste the alcohol (I assume this is why they have an extra shot offer for $3 more). The shake had a variety of fun garnish and was very filling. The flavor stayed true to the mint theme of the drink without being over powering.

Food: Definitely had a great time eating some CRAZY good food :]

- BamBOOZEled Shakes: Shakes with Booze in them :]. I don't remember the names of them, but I really enjoyed the one with the Cereal in it. Sweet, Creamy, and still had the alcohol taste to it.
- BURGERS, OMG SUPER GOOD. My friends NOMed on the El Machete (they suggest you add an Egg in it too!). It has a good kick to it. I had the Rising Sun, and the Avocado Tempura was the part that simply made it spectacular. Shredded Fried Yam and Teriyaki Sauce were a great touch to make it look super lovely.
- Fries: NOOOOO This was a major downfall. Were pretty bland and tasteless. Wish they had more seasoning or something to it!

Service: Our table liked our waitress. One guy at our table was pretty much ""Well she's for sure getting a 20% tip at least"". She was super friendly, threw in some cool jokes, got us some more free popcorn, helped us take a picture, and all with a genuine smile. Definitely the made the night a whole lot better.

Atmosphere: This place has a strange, but great mix of cuteness and casualness. The cartoonish artwork creates a light and whimsical setting, but the lighting and decor definitely bump this place towards a lounge sort of feel. Our group enjoyed it and it fit perfectly into the Vegas atmosphere.

Price: I'm not complaining to be honest, since I feel like I got what I paid for. Though numerically I spent around $30-$40 (For a shake, and burger) it seemed well worth it to me.

Overall Opinion: There were a few things that just dropped this place from a 5. Lack of solid fries, a tinnnnnny bit pricey on the shakes, and just that ounce of ""THIS THING IS SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD TRY"" was missing.

When you are so tempted to steal your neighbors IG worth drink for a pic...

...but you don't! She was more than willing to share for my pic, but I felt weird posting something I didn't order, nor did my table.

This spot came recommended from a friend when I did a crowd sourcing for eateries in Vegas via FB (gees, this is a social media laden post)! On our way to Egg Slut a couple days prior, I noticed it and noted how close it was to our hotel.

That being said, they seriously know how to create their adult milk shakes here. They are so elaborate and look amazing! This isn't to say that their food isn't bad either, its pretty good.

To start we ordered the Poutine --french fries, cheese curds, shredded short rib, & stout gravy. The french fries were crispy and the shredded short rib was really, really good. Tender and flavorful, just lacking in quantity. The stout gravy came on the side and it wasn't my favorite, although I did use some to try it. I'm pretty sure I just wanted a more creamy gravy, this one was more like a thin liquid.

For my entree I ordered the Gold Standard -- Dry aged beef sirloin burger w\/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli. I asked for the tomato confit to be on the side and never even added it to the burger. Oh man, I'm glad I decided to try this place. This burger, just the patty alone, was so flavorful and ahhh-mazing! The bacon was tasty and delicious, but I really loved the bun. The aioli was good, but it didn't make or break my burger.

The burgers are pretty big. We all wished we would have shared between the three of us, in some magical way. The Parentals ordered their own, unfortunately I can't remember what they ordered. Everyone was happily devouring their burgers and had no complaints.

I wanted to order one of those fancy shakes, but didn't really like any of the flavors. However, I did order a Chocolate shake with no whip. The disappointment of how aesthetically pleasing it was in comparison the others was palpable. It tasted great, but it still left me craving the awesomeness of the others.

Our server was awesome the entire time, she was on top of everything. As was the bus boy\/dude that stopped by a few times. We chose to sit in the bar area, so we could watch one of their four TVs, because the Giants were playing in the NLDS. We decided to forgo a regular table and used a coffee table instead, which meant plates on our laps for our burgers. Momma Bear was such a trooper, she sat in this setting with her back to the game so we could watch.

The atmosphere is fun, kinda quirky, and the images along one wall remind me of Warhol-esque style. The prices are what you'd expect in Vegas for alcoholic milkshakes and quality burgers. As long as you know that before hand you'll enjoy your experience.

This place has to be one of the best burger places I've encountered. 

I had the crispy pork belly bun, the rising sun, the gold standard, onion rings and fried pickles. We all ordered this to share and I got a chance of trying everything, and honestly, nothing disappointed. 

The fried pickles exceeded my expectations by far. They were pickle spears battered and deep fried with an aioli dipping sauce. 

The crispy pork belly bun was full of flavor and the meat was so tender. 

The onion rings were fried just right and had the right texture and crunch without being overly oily. 

The burgers were on another level. Though each burger had many different components, it all worked so well together. I cannot wait to come back and try other burgers.

But you'll feel very satisfied you had a yummy meal. (Though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. More on that later.)

My husband and I went on a Sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. We got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners. 

Here's a rundown of what we ordered: All very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. Fun novelty items too. 

1. Fried Pickles: loved this preparation, because these fried pickles are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. This gives each bite a nice tang. Flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. Also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless. 

2. Crispy Pork Belly Bun : Steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. Very, very good,  I've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. Very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. Though. I'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat. 

3. Rising Sun Burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a fried egg...get your napkins! Just get is. That's all I have to say about this one. 

4. Tenderloin Rossini: pork tend loin sliders with foie gras (sp? I dunk, I dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. Came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings. 

5. Cake Lollypop, Nitrogen Merangues, (SP?) Push Pop: Strawberry cheesecake Lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. The nitro meringue (SP?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. Blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! For $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. The push pop...overrated. Nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. Cute concept though. 

Service rocked. Glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. Warm environment, creative menu items. Would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!",2,0,0

I love fine dining and have no problem dropping a good amount of money on a good meal, but I've never had a worse dining experience than at Holsteins. With that being said, let me explain myself.

I had been to Holsteins once before my nightmare of an experience with them, and had a decent experience, the food was good, but none of the visit was anything noteworthy. On my second visit we came to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday, her having chose the venue. We were all dressed up and went to Holsteins sparing no expense and had plans to go to Marquee Monday after dinner. We were seated promptly, and all was well. We then each ordered several drinks, burgers, appetizers, shakes, you name it, and we were all just getting into our meals when our waiter came to fill our water glasses. As he filled our water glasses he accidentally knocked one over, spilling water onto my meal as well as my friend next to me.  We jumped back, as the water was ice cold and we were surprised. He panicked and then promptly began to mop up the water. As he did so, he leaned heavily on our table and the table toppled over, knocking our drinks and food into my friends lap, as well as mine. My friend was wearing white pants, so their cranberry and vodka and my birthday cake cocktail made their white pants look like a menstrual accident. Our waiter went to retrieve some towels, and another staff member tried to bring towels as well. The pants were not salvageable, nor was my barely touched meal. I had ordered a burger and fries, a 13 or 14 dollar cocktail, and an appetizer, all of which were destroyed. I'd only had a sip of my cocktail, less than half of my burger, and just a mere fried pickle before my food was doused with cocktails and spilled into our laps. Our waiter apologized, but no solution was offered. No one asked if they could replace our soiled, inedible meals, or offered to cover our portion of the bill.

I work in a company that prides itself on flawless customer service, and was appalled at the response I received. We were handed our bills and nothing more was said. My friend and I were livid! Any half decent restaurant manager would have comped our entire party and apologized profusely, but he didn't even come to see our party and apologize when the waiter informed him of the situation. We payed our bill and I asked the hostess to see the manager. He came out to talk to me and was the epitome of a young, overly confident prick. I recanted the story of what happened at our table and he stared blanky at me until I finished speaking. His exact words were ""I am sorry about the inconvenience, but I saw the whole thing happen, and it was you guys moving the table that caused it."" 

At this point I was seething with rage. I told him that he wasn't even on the restaurant floor when it happened, and that we had completely leaned away from the table witht the initial spill. He just stared at me with glazed eyes, and nodded his head. I then told him that I knew he really didn't care what I was saying and I didn't appreciate him being patronizing rather than showing any form of empathy. Words cannot describe how horrific this manager was, and because of his lack of any sense I will never give any of my business to this restaurant ever again. I'm quite frankly floored that such an incredible establishment like the Cosmopolitan would allow such people to run one of their restaurants.

All I can say is don't waste your time, the service alone makes this establishment boycott worthy. Save your money and eat elsewhere on the strip. I've heard horror stories about strip eateries, but I've never heard or experienced one as ghastly nightmarish as this.  So again, DO NOT EAT HERE.",0,1,0

John Curtas claimed that Holsteins pork belly buns were almost as good as Momofuku's in NYC (http:\/\/www.eatinglv.com\/2010\/12\/holsteins-has-got-it-goin-on\/) so we had to try them out.  A lemon meringue shake and a Korean burger rounded out the order.  My husband and I were starving from driving around Mandalay Bay and Luxor for an hour trying to find parking and getting stuck in traffic.   Our very nice server quickly took our order.

The food came out very, very fast.  Which was great but also a little disconcerting.  They can cook that fast?  LBS, Holsteins sister restaurant at Red Rock Casino, takes forever!  And we weren't the only ones.  Our neighbors all got their food within 5 minutes of ordering.  Crazy.

The pork buns are NOT ""almost as good"" as Momofuku's.  Not even close.  Maybe because Holsteins can see John Curtas coming a mile a way in his all-white suit, he got a better version.  But these were just ok.

The Korean burger had a good flavor to it but there was too much liquid involved and the bottom bun was pretty soggy.

The lemon meringue shake stole the show.  It's sounds weird but salted caramel in a lemon shake with Grand Marnier - brilliant!

We figured our modest order and half-starved state would leave us enough room to try the infamous China Poblano next door. We were wrong.  The fat content of the food combined with the shake made us full very quickly.

'THE RISING SUN'  - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado

$17 - Tempura avocado was huge, bigger than the burger and it looked awkward and hard to eat.  Bun seems hard to balance on top of it.  Otherwise it was not a bad burger as well.

We once had a less than perfect experience which was immediately taken care of by the manager in a very timely, polite and caring way. This is why there are no stars missing from my review... The way our concerns were addressed and taken care of was highly notable and appreciated.",1,0,0

Made it during the Social Hour (like a happy hour with special menu). Limited to bar and lounge seating. 

Got a spot at the bar and met bartender Kenny. Business has a great selection of boozy milkshakes. Social Hour menu included sharable dishes like egg rolls, sliders and buffalo chicken dip.

Items are priced well.

Milkshakes were huge! Ordered a Drunken Money with candy and taffy decorating the outside. Easy to split this shake with a friend. 

Also ordered sliders and buffalo chicken dip. Kenny didn't steer us wrong. The dip is great! A must have!

I like the fact that they offer late night bites. However, there are just too many other great burger places to choose from. Holsteins falls flat.

The hamburgers were just good, nothing more or less. I really enjoyed the rising sun, but didn't care for the other two (the fun ghi & billionaire burger) that we got. French fries and sweet potatoes were okay, nothing spectacular at all. Though, the crispy onion rings were bomb!
Now, on to the decorated milkshakes! They were all delicious (banana split, the frozen grasshopper, campfire smores), though on the sweeter side (but I mean, it's milkshakes right?). The presentation was awesome, and I think that's what makes me like their milkshakes even more. I barely ate the toppings they included in the milkshake as it was just, so. much. sugar. But, I couldn't let the milkshake go to waste and drank it all the way back to LA.
In general, the restaurant is between a 3 and 4 because it's slightly pricey ($120 total) for these fancy hamburgers and shakes that felt like way too much carbs, sugar, salt, sauce, and candy for one sitting. But I would recommend friends to try, hence the 4 star.

Being on a business trip we had a budget to stick with so we had three separate checks with both credit and cash transactions. When we told the waiter we were met with ""No problem"". I definitely appreciated that!
Food- The burger patty you could tell was very fresh. I think I heard a ""Moo"" from the kitchen! Excellent meat to bun ratio. Probably 6+ ounces or better. They really have a nice variety of topping to please everyone. The fries were very good as well. I really liked that all the shakes listed on the menu you could order with or without the booze. We opted without to capture the true flavor and they did not disappoint. 
Overall I thought for the location and the setting the price point was spot on. I think I paid right around $20 bucks for the burger and fries. My brother added the shake so it came to around $27.

Their vegan patty is ""housemade"" which is what makes it so unique and delicious! Their vegan patty was so amazing! Definitely on my ""Best Vegan Foods to Try"" list! Any vegans, vegetarians, or maybe even meat lovers would love this burger! 

*Cookies & Cream (4\/5): A MILKSHAKE WITH AN ENTIRE ICE CREAM COOKIE SANDWICH ON TOP?! COUNT ME IN! When our waiter presented me with my Cookies & Cream milkshake, I was so excited (and I wasn't even sugar high yet). This milkshake was delicious, except it was too sweet for my taste. If you love sweets, then this you will probably love this very much. This is a bit too much for one person to finish, but it's great for sharing. You can get all the boozy milkshakes without the alcohol for $3 less than the regular price for the boozy milkshakes, so that's what my friends and I did. 

*Frozen Grass Hopper (5\/5): My friend got this milkshake and I was so jealous after I tasted it because it was so good! To me it was so much better than the Cookies & Cream milkshake because it was a lot less sweeter. I also happen to be a mint ice cream enthusiast, so it was a 5 star milkshake for me. Definitely going to get this milkshake next time I come back and I definitely recommend this milkshake to any mint ice cream lovers!

I came walking out of the restaurant very full and satisfied. The fries and onion rings, were all very good, especially the burgers. The milkshakes were very unique and tasty as well.

Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their ""Gold Standard"" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point. 

In general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. 

Overall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.",1,0,0

We ordered the duck fat fries, the baked smashed potatoes, the asian pork belly buns and a regular hamburger. The duck fat fries were OK; in retrospect not worth the price ($7?) because I could barely taste any difference. The pork belly buns were also just OK; they could have used more pork belly, less buns, and a lot more sauce. They were pretty tasteless considering how thick the buns were.

Poutine (French fries, cheese curds, shredded short rib, & stout gravy add fried egg) was ok.

Truffle Mac n' Cheese (creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce, w\/ Maine lobster, & black truffle) was good and served in a mini iron dish.

 

Burgers:

The Rising Sun (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado), Nom Nom (kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island dressing) and the Gold Standard (dry aged beef sirloin burger w\/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli) are the best on the menu served Medium Rare.

Since it's Vegas, there's no point in stressing about the price, since everything is at least 50-100% marked up than what it should be.

The Rising Sun was truly an innovative combo: Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado. Be warned, the Crispy Yam is merely just grated fried yams. The tempura avocado is extremely excellent though. But I mean, how do you go wrong with deep-fried fat? (For further reading: Fried Butter)

The Thai Steak Salad was barely average: Grilled Steak, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Romaine Lettuce, Green Papaya, Mint, Cilantro, Roasted Peanuts, tossed in a Sweet-chili Vinaigrette. The steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and I usually expect a sweeter sauce with my ""Asian"" salads, but the Sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.

The regular fries & the sweet potato fries were mediocre at best, but the Onion rings were crisp, firm, and delicious.

USEFUL: EVERYTHING IS SUPER SALTY. EVERYTHING. Water will get you nowhere. My lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what I was eating. I was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air I breathe. I may try to ask for ""Less salt"" if I ever go back!",2,1,0

That being said, there's a lot of good stuff at Holstein's and I'd proudly give it a 3.5 if that were possible. 

Let's start with their best: the boozy milkshakes (also available in non-boozy versions). I ordered the Fat Boy. It was awesome. Everything you want in a milkshake: candy, delicious vanilla milkshake PLUS booze! 

The service: pretty good. They were very attentive and helpful with the baby . . . even when he spilled all the milk they very nicely brought for him. They were great to the adults too. 

As for the food, as I said, the burgers were a 3.5. The fries were good, not great. I ordered the Gold Standard. I expected better. Not that it was bad, I was just expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. It is a hefty burger . . . split-able if you don't want to stuff yourself, especially if you get a milkshake.

It's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.  Quite possibly some of the best shakes I ever had.  So why just one star?

Well...  When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...  I would have even settled for mediocre...  Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...  I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.  

So how bad was it?  Well...  Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  Well... this was worse.  This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?  No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.  At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.

I really wanted to like this burger.  Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.  The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.

The waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that.

Food: 4, atmosphere: 4, service: 2
Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (my burger with additions was almost $20)
Return worthiness: yes

Highlights:
- Steakhouse burger: loved the pepper-crusted patty as it was no joke--you could see the full peppercorns. The onions were sweet and really good. I added an egg which was cooked perfectly so it ran to create it's own sauce from its yolk. Only con was the bun wasn't anything special or worth it.
- Bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños: spicy! Liked the crispy bacon. There was cheese inside but not too much which my partially Asian stomach appreciated.
- Fried pickle spears: had the bumpy kind of breading which I liked
- Milkshakes: my friends loved these fun combos like smores or banana peanut butter cup (drunken monkey). See above comment for why I couldn't enjoy one, but I would've loved to. They do have fun vodka flavors on hand to make these like chocolate coconut which I do want to try.
- Fried bacon: never seen this outside of a county fair, but was pretty good in a smooth crispy batter
- Longhorn burger: the hub got this with BBQ brisket on the burger which seems crazy, but as a meat lover pizza type, he liked it
- Sweet potato fries: crispy and the right level of sweetness. I couldn't stop eating them.
- Decor: liked the fun art on the walls with toki doki-like characters

Midlights:
- Philly cheese steak egg roll: they looked like the Jack in the Box ones--which I love by the way--but with a tough exterior  that didn't work for me

Lowlights:

The environment, food & service was good, but I do not understand what the buzz & rave reviews are about!

We arrived at about 9PM on a Wednesday & were promptly seated in the restaurant section (we could have sat in the bar or lounge area, but both were a little too noisy for us).    

I ordered a chocolate milkshake ($9) the ""Urth"" burger ($13) plus cheddar cheese ($2), mushrooms ($2) & grilled onions ($2) and for an extra $2 I could upgrade from fries to onion rings, so I did that as well.

My friend ordered the Executive burger, cooked medium, and a water.

Service was good -- not great, not bad, but OK\/good.

Ambiance -- casual attire by both guests as well as waitstaff, a little artsy architecture, numerous TVs on the walls.  Nothing pretentious, nor elegant.

Food -- My $9 chocolate shake didn't taste any different than a McDonalds chocolate shake, other than that it came with some whipped cream on the top (sorry, no cherry) & a little extra in a metal cup, old-school style.
My burger was great, but $19 great? Absolutely not.  I could have loaded-up at 5 Guys or In & Out burger and been just as happy with my burger, for a lot less $.   As for the onion rings, they were good, but not great, and on-par with a fresh order of onion rings you might get from Burger King!

My friend said his burger was good (not great...) despite it clearly being medium-rare, not the medium he ordered.

Total bill came to $50, + $10 tip = $60 for two, no alcohol & my friend just drinking water.

I realize Holstein's is in the Cosmopolitan & probably pays a lot of rent, but to the customer, that fact alone shouldn't justify the high prices -- better quality, better service, better interior design are needed there.

Am I glad I finally got around to trying Holstein's?  Sure!  Will I go back? Only if friends want to try it, but I'll try steering them elsewhere first.   We will certainly wander around the Cosmo and be awed by the high-class, sometimes ostentatious scenery, but if we're not on some sort of expense account, we'll go elsewhere for dinner.

They had a tiny what they called ""lounge"" consisting of 4 tables and two chairs each so we took that.

Only for those who are in love and have no problem getting a little messy for your partner.... or if you're just going out with friends. Besides the mess... wow its a good burger.

I see this place all the time when I'm at The Cosmopolitan but never took it seriously because it looks a little cartoon-ey with the cartoon cow images hanging outside of the restaurant. But OMG I am a huge fan and cannot wait to come back! Here's why:

- Once you sit down, they give you a bucket of popcorn which is basically like crack. Freaking addicting. I don't know what kind of seasoning is on it, but we loved it so much that we bought 2 boxes of it to take with us!
- Boozy milkshakes. And they are amazingly obnoxious! We ordered a boozy milkshake that had candy corn stuck to the rim, a candy cane sticking out, and a SLICE OF PUMPKIN PIE on top! So insane and so good and so genius!
- French fries are crucial. They have regular and sweet potato, so we ordered both. They were perfectly crunchy and that's exactly how they should be. The portions were also very generous! And I think they make their own ketchup which means they take french fries seriously. They also have onion rings if you're not a french fry person.
- Saved the best for last. THE BILLIONAIRE BURGER. Here are the deets: Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, & truffle mayo. I took a bite of my burger and thought ""holy crap!"" The burger was so rich and so full of flavor! The bun was fluffy which is always a plus. The beef was delicious and perfectly cooked. Foie gras was fatty and tasty.

There's a DJ in the restaurant, so if you are not here for the LOUD music - come here before 9 ~ 10 PM.

Good service and free complimentary popcorn - unfortunately, it tasted like a regular popcorn (I like kettle corn better than plain popcorn).

Truffle lobster mac n cheese (creamy Tallegio-mascarpone Sauce, with Maine lobster and black truffle - $16.5) - Wow, what an amazing appetizer. Not too creamy with a hint of lobster flavor. Definitely one of the top mac n cheese in my book.

The Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado - $17, medium rare) - I love it! I really liked the tempura-fried avocado and the Kobe beef patty. The only downside? Teriyaki sauce was a bit too strong. 

Excellent burger and mac n cheese, enough said.

* Hen House ($15) - 4.5 STARS: Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup. This was probably my favorite burger, even though it is so simple. Ordered medium rare, ofcourse.

Our waitress was super helpful and gave some great suggestions. She couldn't convince us to get the milkshakes, but mostly because we had a night of partying and milkshakes just didn't seem like the right way to start out.

For appetizers we tried: - (numbers\/in relation to Yelp stars)
Lobster Corn Dogs (4\/5) - Crispy, fried, and corn dogs! YUM
Street Tacos (5\/5) - AMAZING, duck meat wasn't over cooked, was very juicy.
Truffle Lobster Mac & Cheese (4\/5) - Truffle Oil was everywhere in Vegas and this was a great place to find it.
Bull's Balls (1\/5) - Dry, grainy, and should have been returned to the kitchen.

All the burgers were amazing so I won't go into breaking them down. The fries all came out very hot and done well. Probably wouldn't order duck fat ones next time, but that's because the sweet potato ones were great.

First off, we were greeted by enthusiastic and energetic table staff who proceeded to tell us about the menu and why Holsteins is a step above the rest.

He never brought the promised samples of beer, proclaimed Boddingtons (an English bitter) was a white\/wit beer and took so long to bring extra cranberry sauce for the sawdust-dry turkey burger I ate, it was long choked down before he reappeared.

Beyond service, the food wasn't substantial, but some in our party loved their burgers.

Kettle Chips - like any other kettle chip.
Southern Fried Chicken Fingers-n-Waffles - Nice crisp to the chicken, syrup was warm and the waffle was.... well, a waffle.
New England Turkey - Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Dry like the dessert we were sitting in.
The Classic - Juicy and medium-rare.
The Longhorn - Meat-lovers delight.
Duck, Duck, Goose - Rich and hearty.
Korean 'Bull' Gogi - The egg was unnecessary and added nothing extra.
'Big Fat Greek' - Creamy and dreamy.

Duck Fat Fries - Didn't taste any different than the shoestring fries that came with our burgers.
Truffle Popcorn - Tasted like butter with no hint of truffle.

We ordered the fried pickles to start and I then got the Fun-ghi. This is a burger I would typically get. My husband guessed that's what I'd order. It just missed the mark for me. It was a little too well done and lacked flavor.

2. I had the Big Fat Greek (lamb burger). It was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty. The olive relish was almost as thick as the burger, wtheck!
3. Male friend ordered the Rising Sun(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal. Soo yummy, but I think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it. :\
4. My 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice. Maine lobster roll for $16.50. The two rolls were COLD, and they were not rolls, at least not where I came from haha.Those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks. Two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'. Wtheck!

Pizza Twinkies:  Looked like a twinkie...tasted like a pizza.  Yum!  

Crispy Pork Belly Sliders:  Kind of like peking duck, but with crispy fried pork belly.  The bun was made from scratch.  It was chewy, fluffy, just sheer perfect!

The 2nd time we came and just grabbed a drink...The Funky Monkey or something...a banana milk shake with alcohol in it.  Yum!!!!

Third time we came was before leaving for the airport, and almost ended up missing our flight, but it was worth it.  

Fried Green Tomatoes with popcorn shrimp togo!  It stayed crispy the whole way to the airport!

Reminiscent of cartoons or tatoos, the pigs encourage the eating of beef although I'm not sure why they would be dressed up like the cows. A local tattoo artist did all the art giving the restaurant a casual gallery feel. Arrived at 11 opening on a Saturday and were seated right away.

Popcorn in a metal pail was on the table. The server immediately offered and brought waters for the table on the 115 degree day. The Classic Burger was very good, juicy and served with a metal pail of fries and a requested side of fresh jalapenos. The Gold Standard Burger for a few more dollars had upgraded toppings - smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar making a big difference in taste between the two - as well as a slightly better advantage from the dry aged sirloin. The burgers and fries were very good. Serious Eats lists this as the best burger in Vegas and it may be as I've not tried others. The sliders looked a bit drier than the bigger burgers as usual. The fries were fine. I would have liked to try more items including the sweet potato fries. The prices are resort-like as you might expect - $14 for classic burger and fries.

The decor doesn't seem to fit the upscale flashy decor of Cosmo but it's not ugly or anything & is definitely more casual.  Anywhoo, after much deliberation with their attractive menu, I finally decided on the Rising Sun burger ($16.50) with the shoestring fries.  The Rising Sun is a big kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, crispy yam strings, spicy mayo & nori furikake.  He chose the Gold Standard ($17.50) which is dry-aged sirlion with crispy bacon, tomato confit, baby arugla, garlic chive aoli & goat cheese (he substitued swiss though).  The prices are up there, but it's in the plush Cosmo & at least they came with fries (which some burgers at First Food & Bar at Palazzo don't for around the same price).  He chose the seasoned steak fries.  

Next time I'm going to go for their thick seasoned steak fries!  While shoestring is always good because their so crispy, these fries were still crispy on the edges & seasoned so well!  Everything worked so well with my burger!  Loved the tempura avocado & the sauces worked well & wasn't really messy.  The mayo wasn't spicy but maybe that's a good thing so it wouldn't overpower the burger.  The only thing I didn't like & this is always a pet peeve of mine..is the temperature was off!  I requested medium & it was at least medium well.  It wasn't really dried out but I wanted some juice!  I had a nibble of his burger too & it was pretty damn good, but I loved my Asian inspired burger lots more!  I was so stuffed at these massive burgers & the fries that I couldn't finish & had to leave some fries behind & give him the last few nibbles of my burger.

Dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, aragula, and garlic-chive aioli. Oh Em Gee!! Flavor overload! The burger was so juicy, it was dripping (I get mine medium). The sweet potato fries is the best I've had. I love that it's perfectly crispy on the outside and comes sprinkled with salt. Yum!
Another favorite? The shakes! I don't always drink shakes, but when I do... I like them to have a double shot :) The drunken monkey, the campfire smores, and cookies n cream. All shakes are delicious. The cookies and cream has a huge ice-cream sandwich on top. 
I don't think there is anything you can order here and go wrong. You really don't need an appetizer, a burger, fries, AND shake will stuff you. I took half my burger and fries home.

My husband had a beer of some kind, which he really liked, and I had an Oreo and bailey's milkshake, which was excellent. 

For dinner my husband ordered the Big Fat Greek - a spicy lamb burger. The burger was excellent. The feta cheese and tatziki sauce paired with the flavors of the meat very well. It was a great burger all-in-all. 

I ordered the Radicchio Steak Salad, and it was quite a disappointment. First off, I've ordered a Radicchio salad before, but the radicchio in this one was extremely bitter, so bitter I couldn't eat it. So I called the waiter back and told him it was extremely bitter. He was very obliging and offered to change the radicchio out for some regular greens, which I decided to take him up on. He also mentioned that a lot of patrons do this with the Radicchio Salad, which made me wonder why he hadn't offered to do this when we ordered, or warned me that the Radicchio would be bitter. Either way, they changed out my salad for no charge and brought back my steak on a bed of greens. The second thing I did not like in the salad was that the steak was done medium rare, and I like mine well done. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and when I asked to have it cooked a little more the waiter apologized and said it would not be possible due to safety regulations. Once a dish is plated and brought out to a customer, it cannot be put back in a pan. So I just ate a few bits of the steak. The rest of the salad was ok. The Dressing it came with was pretty tasty, but if I go back to Holsteins Shakes and Buns, I'll be sticking to a burger.",0,0,0

The gourmet burger craze is sweeping the industry right now, and of course it landed at the new Cosmo hotel. We had some time to kill in between lunch and dinner, so we dropped by for a relatively small snack. The 3-stars is strictly just for the few items we ordered.

Walking through the bar, there was a strong ""wet rag"" stench that permeated throughout the area. It was weird. Then my eyes moved over to see people sucking down on shakes. I have to admit, those ""bamboozled"" shakes looked intriguing, even if they were $11. Plus, they had alcohol in them. They need to do a shake challenge here, pronto.

My wife and I decided to split an appetizer and a burger. On the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered the philly cheese steak spring rolls and the ""Hook"" burger. The inside of the spring rolls were still raw and doughy, and you could still see some of the flour from the egg roll wrapper. The filling inside was nasty. Little brown bits of meat drenched in a cheese whiz like gooey sauce. $12 for 3!

We told the waiter, and he was nice enough to take it away, and we could order something else. We opted for the fried dill spear pickles, which were delicious. The tart and tangy, crisp crunch of the pickles combined with a side of prosciutto and salami was a fantastic combination.

As for the burger, there was nothing terribly complex about it, but it was executed well. Whereas others grind their salmon to make a patty, here it was left untouched. Just lightly seared and cooked to a medium, topped with house cured gravlax (fancy term for lox). Coupled with the caper herb mayo, It was a tasty burger.",6,5,4

The restaurant was not accepting open table reservations for the day we were wanting to go. 

We entered the restaurant and the bar area was packed, but the dining room was fairly empty. The hostess said there was a 40 minute wait for a party of two. I respectfully declined the wait for a table and proceeded to look for bar seating. It appeared to be full, but then noticed an empty table near the dj booth at the second entry. It took a few minutes for a waitress to get to us but wasn't too excessive of a wait. I asked to be moved to one of the many empty four tops in the dining room, but the waitress said that we couldn't move to one of the open tables and it needed to be setup with the hostess. I think this was a crowd control tactic, but who knows.. Food came out fairly quick, we got the rising sun and turkey burger, both were pretty good and reasonably priced. Fries were included and were a tad bit too greasy. Drinks were reasonably priced, around $12-15 each. I'd probably go back if I'm back and could get a reservation.

The first two times I had a great experience, and so I will tell you about my 3rd. 

My two friends and I got there about 2pm on Saturday and the place was pretty jumping. Almost every time we have come it's been jumping so expect a 10-15 minute wait to get seated. We left our name with the cute hostess and  they took our phone number. Instead of using those little beeper things, they just text someone's phone in the group when your table is ready. I love technology. 

We waited in the Chandelier lounge and had a Fire-Breathing Dragon cocktail while we waited. It was a little pricey, but fun none the less. 

We got seated, and boom-got the complimentary Salt & Vinegar popcorn to start off and some chilled waters as soon as we sat down. 

After perusing the menu, which seems to get new items every few months, I chose the Portabello Mushroom burger and the Cereal Shake (made with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream,1 oz. vanilla vodka,  1\/2 cup Cap'n Crunch cereal (dry),milk, as needed to get desired consistency,whipped cream (for garnish) and a shot of Whipped cream Vodka I think?) which tasted delicious! The shakes come in standard shake glass and make room for the extra they bring out in the silver shaker-bonus! My friends ordered the Billionaire burger ($28 -OUCH!) and the Tiramisu shake-and my other friend ordered the Gold Medallion burger I think it was? 

If your on a budget, the burgers and shakes are just big enough meal
to split between two people or a couple, in addition to the free Salt & Vinegar popcorn.

Shakes came our first, which are almost a meal in themselves. The last two times I ordered the campfire smores and Almondy Joy (Cause I love chocolate) but decided to try the Cereal shake because I love cap'n crunch. I have to say I like the Tiramisu over my Cereal Shake which was super sweet. 

We ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese which is always good (wish they gave us a larger serving!) and we gobbled that dish down in no time between the 3 of us. 

Burgers showed up shortly after without a beat. I also ordered a fried egg  on mine. My meat was moist, the portobello succulent, the avocado delish, and the fried egg cooked just enough not to run all over the place. This burger is way too big to eat without spilling everywhere so I cut it in half to make it easier. The fries here are not my favorite, but come with meal, the onion rings were pretty good though.

Though my burger was good, I tasted my friends billionaire burger and the aged-Kobe beef topped with Goose liver (which is why it was expensive) and I have to say her burger was better than mine. Don't know if I could justify the extra $12 for it. My other friend who is a big foodie, said his Medallion burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a restaurant, and he's a very picky foodie. 

All in all another great experience,  I like the hustle and bustle of the place, and all the good looking people in Cosmopolitan is never a let down. Thought he place is not cheap if your looking for an inexpensive place to eat, it's a fun experience overall and great to get a slight buzz from from a shake!

*note* I went hope and napped after my amazing meal. 

Hope this helps!

Cheers!

I went late night and expected a full menu, but was told instead it was their late night menu so that was a nice segway to drink and have ""finger food"" as I called it. That would've been nice to know over the phone prior to making the trek over there.

I decided to drain my frustrations in a spicy bloody mary and I'll be damned if it wasn't as advertised. Clamato with jock itch is more like it, but either way it did tickle the taste buds quite well and I HATE spicy! We also had ordered the lobster mac n cheese (2 by accident) and it was hit or miss. The first one was beyond salty and the 2nd one was spot on and the bread crumb crust was a delight down the pipes! We also did try the surf n turf quesadilla which was small, but delectable!

Disappointed with things we decided to go the day after for lunch. As a ""preflight"" meal, they gave us salt and vinegar popcorn which I wolfed down! I really thought to myself GROSS, but upon chomping away all I could say was YES YES YES! I felt Rockafeller so I dove into the billionaire burger and that was by far the best burger I have ever had. I ordered it medium rare after watching the food channel and from bun to bun the taste was nothing but fun! It was juicy, the foie gras and truffle mayo was a true jackpot! 

To top it off you must must get an alcoholic milkshake as well to wash down the meal. I had the campfire smore and it's one of the many things in life that make you go hmm. If you don't make this a stop on your Vegas outing you forever will be square and not there!",0,0,0

The decor is somewhat surreal but it adds to the quirky feel of the place which is topped off by a huge pink cow.

By this point of my Vegas excursion I was sick of eating burgers, steaks and hugely calorific meals so I opted for the Cobb salad. I also had a milkshake which was pretty good as milkshakes go but come on, it's pretty difficult to screw up a milkshake.

I brought my husband, baby and father in law here for lunch. It is definitely a swanky burger place in Cosmo. I definitely was a bit annoyed that they did not validate and we had to pay $7 bucks for parking just to eat here.

It is located by ""the chandelier"" area. The restaurant layout is pretty open. No solid walls separating you from the outside window shoppers. The design of the cows are cute and the wall tile things are flip arounds.

There was no wait when you went and was promptly seated.

My husband got the classic burger but modified to be a simple bacon burger. My father in law got the captain hook and I got the chicken burger. My husband also ordered a modified virgin oreo shake and I got a strawberry shake for the babes.

They give you popcorn while you wait for your food (fun).

We ordered the buttermilk onion rings as an app and that came out the same time as our shakes. The onion rings were fried to a golden crisp and tasted good with their chipotle dipping sauce but comparable to other places with the same item.

Strawberry shake tasted like they used real, fresh strawberrys and not the ones soaked in red sauce. 

The ""oreo shake"" came with a ginormous cookie sandwich on top which filled half of my husband's stomach prior to receiving his actual meal. He also liked the flavor.

bacon burger: decent sized and good in taste. Nothing special.

captain hook: the salmon was beautifully grilled and topped with a piece of smoked salmon which my father in law liked. definitely a fancy smancy burger.

chicken burger: chicken was nicely grilled. juicy and not dry. sauce on the buns blended well together. 

*all burgers came with fries

I didn't feel this place was worth all the hype. I can definitely get the chicken and beef burger somewhere else for cheaper (like Stacked in California). The salmon burger was fresh and delicious (worth the price). A lunch that consists of burger, fries, onion rings and shakes that comes out to well over $100 is a bit excessive.

We came a little after noon and were seated promptly, though it started filling up quite a bit after that.  I ordered the classic burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and split the Campfire S'mores milkshake with my dining companion.  The shake was delicious and the alcohol taste was very subtle which I did not mind.  It comes with some extra in a tin container and was more than enough for the two of us to share.  I was disappointed though that some of the other shakes I wanted to try were only seasonal.   

As we were waiting I noticed popcorn being brought out to another table twice.  I had to ask for some after seeing that and our server acted surprised that none had been brought out.  Hmm, wasn't it his job to do it or at least see to it that we got some and didn't he look at our table and see that we had none?  By the time our popcorn was brought out our burgers came out a minute later, so we didn't get to enjoy too much of the popcorn. 

We were debating as to whether we should split a burger or get our own and in the end we each got our own because from what we could see they looked pretty small.  Turned out we actually could have split one and it would have been enough for the two of us.  Personally that would have been fine for me because I wasn't too thrilled with the burger and have definitely had better.  I usually do not mind pickles in my burger but theirs just did not taste good and I had to pick them out.  The other greens in my burger did not taste good either.  To top it all off I asked for my burger to be cooked well done and it came out pink inside.  My burger came with shoestring fries which were ok.  They were super skinny so at the end of the meal it looked like I hadn't even touched them.  

If you are looking for a good burger and fries at the Cosmopolitan I highly recommend the burger at Commes Ca, truly some of the best burgers and fries I've had and for about the same price as what you'd get at Holstein's.

I've heard great things of Holsteins from a source that winds up in Vegas a lot for business and this also made their list of must eats when they're in town. What is more comforting than shakes and buns in your belly..that came out strange..it sounded a lot sweeter in my head. On to Holsteins goodness!

Luckily when we came down from our room there was no wait when we walked over to Holstein's and it was already poppin' at the bar lounge area. Once we got sat down we were greeted with a bucket of spicy, cheesy popcorn which was a yummy introduction. I had the Cereal Bowl 2.0 shake that had 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Vanilla Ice Cream, Fruit Loops, and Cap'n Crunch blended into a beautiful oblivion (yeah I dropped a Eve 6 line..please be friends with me still! haha) My Bam-Boozled Shake was delightful. Usually Vodka is my kryptonite, apparently when you add ice cream and cereal it's the perfect combo for a non-Asian inferno. 

For starters we got an order of Fried Pickle Spears. They were golden, delicious, and chock full of hot dill juice. Just couldn't wait to dive in and wound up with dripping pickle juice everywhere. It was worth it though because they were tasty as heck!

My burger decision was pretty easy. I got The Rising Sun Burger to commemorate planning our trip to Japan in December (which I am super excite to Yelp from as well! Fingers crossed I learn enough Japanese by then! ^__^) The Rising Sun had a slew of delicious including kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. The burger was perfectly medium and the crunch from the furikake and crispy yam blended into the slight crispy and buttery smooth tempura avocado.

Since my Cereal Bowl 2.0 was basically dessert I passed on dessert time. I will gladly drop in to Holstein's Shakes & Buns for another round of amazing Shakes & Buns which is what my buns did as I giddily bounced in my chair with every tasty sip and bite.",2,1,2

The staff greeted us as soon as we walked into the establishment. We got a booth right away, probably because we went before the dinner rush.

Both my wife and I ordered a hamburger and a shake. The burger was heavenly; the bun toasted just right, the meat melted in my mouth. Easily the best hamburger I have ever eaten. I just got a vanilla shake (without alcohol), but it was still one of the most delicious shakes I've had.

So round two...Came in on a Tuesday night with a reservation...not needed. Sat down and ordered fairly quickly. Never received the comp popcorn. Got the food, perfectly cooked, but never checked on. Had to request for refills twice. I was given the bill WITHOUT being asked if we wanted dessert (we did)....not even sure if I got a thank you.  

I asked the server for a milkshake recommendation, (they make all shakes virgin if requested), and was told about the twinkie cake.

This was a great hamburger, with a nice and thick slice of foie gras! The onions added a nice consistency and taste, but I didn't really notice the truffle mayo. The burgers here were coming apart as well, and it didn't pack the punch I've had elsewhere in town, but good overall! I'd say it might be a #5-6 on my scale!  4 stars!

It ended up being a burger weekend for me in Vegas. After having my usual In-n-Out, Carl's Jr and Jacks, I decided I'd treat myself to a really good one. I didn't get to have dinner until 11pm and this was one of the few places in the hotel still open.

Boy it didn't disappoint! I had the Steakhouse Burger and some hand cut fries. Decided to skip the milkshakes and have a beer instead. Brooklyn Pale Ale did the job.

My coworker opted for the Classic and had no complaints.

Service was fast and friendly. Besides, it was 11pm on a Monday night and the place was practically empty. Ask for Justin!

Like most things in The Cosmopolitan, it's a bit on the pricier side. The bill for two can easily hit $50 and that's even before the booze. It's ok though because it was well worth it.

I honestly wasn't sure what to expect but this restaurant blew me and my tastebuds away!

After a long (and sober) day at the Encore Beach Club my girls and I needed a stiff drink and some hearty food, what better place than Holsteins Shakes and Buns?! I really didn't know what to expect, my friend had found the restaurant through Yelp and I'd seen a few signs so wasn't prepared for the sheer awesome that was this restaurant. It wasn't crazy busy yet (5.00pm-ish so we'd beat the dinner crowd) so we were given a nice booth-style table in the back with no wait time whatsoever. Holsteins decor is chic meets cute- murals of cartoon cows interacting various foodstuffs like sexy pickle ladies and meat patties with eyes and limbs line the walls, sounds weird but its really cute!

The menu is pretty vast but honestly don't even try and go healthy while you're here. They are famous for their burgers and shakes so you need to order at least one (or both if you have the stomach) of these items! I could not physically stomach a huge milkshake at this point in the day but the ones coming past our table looked RIDICULOUS in the best possible way so I lived vicariously through the other tables.

To start, my table ordered Mexican Car Bombs and the Lobster Mac & Cheese for appetisers. Sadly, I could not have the latter as I am highly allergic but the Mexican Car Bombs were the absolute BEST jalapeno poppers I have ever taste in my life. I wished there were more of them as they serving they gave just didn't seem like enough deliciousness!
Both my friends got the Gold Standard Burger (one with a side of Onion Rings) and I ordered the Al Pastor. My burger was incredible! Juicy, flavourful and tender it was all the good things a burger should be. I couldn't stop eating even though I was getting incredibly full very quickly and I totally had to roll myself out of the restaurant. Also shoutout to the cocktail menu- I grabbed a 'Couples Retreat' which was super refreshing and very much what I needed after a long day at a pool party.

Holsteins is located at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino directly across the entrance to the Marquee Pool and Day club. Because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  We did have a reservation and were seated on time. The decor at Holsteins is eighties cool. Cartoon Artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. After looking over the menu, my wife Simone ordered the Meatball Parm sliders and I ordered the Nom-Nom burger topped with melted cheese, Potato Chips and House made thousand Island dressing. The food came out fairly quickly, and on the side I had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin french fries. My burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). An overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. The burger could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. The Chips on top were the best part of the burger. Medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to the burger, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. Simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. The meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. They were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. I so wanted to steal them from her and I had total meat envy.  We finished off the meal with a Reese PB adult shake spiked with Frangelico called the Drunken Monkey.  Any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because I could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. It was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  So in the end I would have given Holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however Simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall Holsteins gets a three stars from me.",1,0,0

Burgers were good. Very good.

This place typifies the Las Vegas burger, minus the In-and-Out down the street (which we traveled to twice, didn't come back to Holsteins).

I get it, arugula is fancy, it's not worth a $15 burger though. Service was terrible, waited about 20 minutes for a table, being the first party on a non-existent, no-names last. Then, hostess: ""oh, someone just took that table that opened up. Sorry!"" ... wait, what exactly is your job here? Anyhow... sat at the bar due to hungry, takes forever to get anything ordered, and bartender literally stops attending to respond to someone else's commentary on something or other. Worthless service.

I dunno. I mean. Burgers people. Not $20, not $30. You'll probably spend like $50 for 2 burgers and a beer. I can't do it. I'm in the wrong city. But, In-and-Out is down the street! Under $10 for two to eat, and way better service than Holsteins. Fail.

Good food though.

I had the Birthday Cake milkshake I can't seem to find a menu online, so I can't tell you what was in it - but it was good. And definitely had a nice kick of booze. 

Because there were multiple shakes I liked - I went back. Same drill - order my milkshake at the bar - sit and wait - and wait.

Cons: My burger was not quite what I had expected. I got the Korean Bulgogi burger that comes with a fried egg and kim chi. Sounds epic right? Turns out that the patty was drenched in some type of sweet teriyaki sauce, which I was not particularly fond of. Also, the prospect of Duck Fat Fries was presented to us. Sounds epic too right?

Solid, solid burger spot. First of all, the artwork. They have a pig for a mascot and the artwork depicts said pig experiencing various culinary delights. Very very good stuff. 

On to the food. We started the meal with Mexican Car Bombs. No, no, this isn't a play on the Irish bombs. No Dos Equis Patron shots. They are jalapenos stuffed with cheese, black beans and corn then wrapped in bacon!!! Holy bacon fat batman! Excellent creation and a must order. 

Burgers: 

Gold Standard was delicious. Bacon and aged goat cheddar with their udder sauce. The sauce is tangy and could use an addition of spice. 

The Classic was pretty good. Basic burger dressed with tomato, onion, lettuce and of course, we added some swine and queso. 

Shakes:

I went for the peppermint choco shake, no alcoholic cause I don't drink anymore. It tastes a bit like a girl scout cookie that may have found it's way to your doorstep in months past. 
Strawberry was solid, with some gummy candies added to the top .Whipped cream is fresh and made in house, excellent touch there.

There are a few drawbacks though, price is one. Pretty expensive, but its what you expect for being in one of the upper class casinos. My GF got the Ahi tuna sliders and they were a JOKE, not good and cost something like $15. Also it has a very club like atmosphere, don't come here expecting a romantic dinner or anything, this is a bar scene more than a restaurant.

Located right across the entrance to Marquee, it's an all too familiar location, but unfortunately a location I probably won't return to.

Upon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. The hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would ""have to"" walk us over. She made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. Rude. We still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. A horrible system.

It took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. Another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. Two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. After a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.

- ""Meat Ball"" Burger ($15): Beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provolone cheese, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. The meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. Of course, I loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. It could use some marinara sauce. Not the best choice here.

- The Fun-Ghi ($17): Beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  This one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. There was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. A superb burger indeed. 

Fries with one burger, onion rings with the other. Both were good quality. The onion rings weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.

- Banana Cream Pie Shake ($13): Bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. Absolutely delicious. Although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. Also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. Despite this, I sipped it down to the last delicious drop.

After finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. The restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. Even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking.

I ordered the Urth Burger, which is their vegan burger. It was fine. The patty was thick and moist. My only complaint is that the burger itself was a bit dry. It was supposed to come with avocado, but there was only a light green schmear on one of the buns. 

The boy ordered the traditional burger. He seemed to love it. He pretty much devoured the whole thing. 

Both the orders came with fries. He got the natural cut fries and I ordered the sweet potato fries. When the fries first came out, there were cold and soggy. We sent them back to the kitchen and got a new batch. 

His natural cut fries were way better than the sweet potato fries. My sweet potato fries were cut too thin, so most of the fries were overcooked and burnt.

We showed up about 30 minutes after they opened on a Saturday and there was no wait which was great. Our server was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. If you haven't worked up an appetite, I'd highly recommend sharing. The spiked shakes are whimsical, delicious, and just over the top. I loved the cookies n' cream shake; you can't really taste any of the booze in it so don't expect it to give you a buzz or anything. I also tried their turkey burger which was flavorful and it comes with a great thousand island-ish sauce which is perfect for dipping your fries in (ask for it on the side!).  Our table also shared the truffle mac n' cheese which is a good portion for one person if you're craving something cheesy and aren't feeling burgers. Mac n' cheese was pretty good too but I couldn't appreciate it since I was stuffed with fries, a creamy milkshake, and bites of the giant ice cream sandwich on top of the shake. 

I also like the casual vibes of the place-- great spot to just have a chill meal with your group. Don't be surprised if your dress for the cluuuurb later that night seems to be a bit snug :)",0,1,2

We luckily snagged a dining area right up front from the hostess stand while the other current diners were just leaving. Apparently the restaurant was packed and quite eventful despite our feelings otherwise.

The table was still full of food, given the fact we were offered the only available seating at the time, but service was very quick to remove and set up for us promptly. 

We decided on the Fun-Ghi burger & the crispy pork belly buns. For desert, we were recommend the Tiramisu shake based on our preference of chocolate. We even got it to go and non-alcoholic. Everything came out surprisingly fast. *The menu is quite extensive so there are many choices for everything. Look online in advance or take a look on the menu outside.

The Fun-ghi was delicious, but I really was expecting more from a 17$ burger. Truffle marinated Portabella mushroom, caramelized onions, frisee, and mayo with a beef patty. Rich and pleasantly mild despite the idea of alluring funky-nees from the truffle and gruyere. Ordered with sweet potatoes fries that were executed perfectly, although they only came with your normal and boring grocery ketchup rather than a unique dipping sauce or aioli that most burger places in its caliber of category offer.

The Crispy Pork Belly buns were such a disappointment. So unpleasantly sweet, as if the pork itself were candied. And to add insult to the matter, the herbs or greens accompanied did not compliment the dish what so ever and gave it a medicinal and rather off putting taste. Terrible really.

Shake was great but not anything special, and again, for the price of 13+?

The service from our waitress could not have been any better. So polite and friendly and frequently checked back on us despite a full house; Impressive. I also believe the owner stopped by at one point and asked us how we were and carried on by removing some trash from our table.

It's the questionable prices and the food quality that contributed to the 3 stars. I understand the atmosphere is apart of the experience (beautiful artsy and urban decor, obviously located in the upscale  and modern cosmopolitan) and leads way into the pricing, but it's quite unnecessary and confusing when the food isn't as up to par.

I finally got there last night, and boy was I excited. I'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so I knew exactly what I wanted. To my surprise, it was dinnertime on Friday and we got seated right away. There were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. My husband ordered a $6 root beer and I got the $11 cereal bowl shake. My husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. My shake was good, but I couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. I ordered the rising sun burger medium-well and my husband got the gold standard medium-rare, both with steakfries. When the burgers arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as ""pretty"" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. I tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? Both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. And my beef patty was a lot thinner than I anticipated. I think the burgers are called ""big buns"" because the bun's bigger than the burger and fixin's! The waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why I wanted to try the place! I told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, ""Oh, since you ordered the shake, I just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. Most people don't get both."" It might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! The dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on the bottom. It was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! It was adorable! But I wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. I probably won't return to Holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts.

I like their happy hour--it's reasonable prices for beer! As for food, I'm not too dazzled by it. The lobster mac & cheese didn't have enough flavoring. The salad wasn't bad--but the tuna was alright. It didn't amaze me. Just a regular salad really. As for the Surf 'N Turf quesadilla.. It was.. interesting.. I'm not sure I like it. It had lobster and grilled steak in it and I guess I figured out that I don't really like that combo--wasn't for me. And it was such a small portion so I was very surprised. I also didn't really like the fact that there wasn't much cheese inside the quesadilla so I guess that's also why I didn't like it too much.

I went with the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, my gf had the Meat Ball Grinder. We also got an order or shoestring fries. I contemplated getting an alcoholic milkshake, but I figured it would be a waste since the food & shake itself would likely counteract the effects of the alcohol, and I also assume the amount of booze in each shake is equivalent to one conservative shot. 

The Meat Ball Grinder was good, but I also have yet to find a meatball anywhere on Earth as good as my Dad's, so I'm going to be biased eternally. The Pork Belly, however, was so goddamn good.

I always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino I'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the Cosmo I include Aria's options).   Since I splurged a little with Julian Serrano a few weeks back, I thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with Holsteins.  This wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because I'd been wanting to try their Gold Standard Burger ever since I'd read John Curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in Las Vegas.

Given the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection\/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture\/buried alive death) I passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  I instead opted for my usual Jack and Coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as I normally prefer.

For food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (I know, it's a burger joint) and I just didn't feel like I needed any of that before I gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  I ordered the Gold Standard with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.

Shortly thereafter the burger arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a Dry Aged Sirloin patty, nice smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (I had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   I already forgot.  Roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   The burger was perfectly cooked, and I really enjoyed every bite of it.   I do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  I'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but I felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  I'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as Sam Jackson would say, but all in all I still prefer almost any I've had at Bachi or Fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   The fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   Service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  I can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.",2,1,1

Our table shared everything.  We started with the Artichoke ""guac,"" which was hummus mixed with artichokes and served with spicy pita chips.  It was awesome, would definitely order it again.  We also had the kettle chips, which come with french onion dip.  Although the rest of my party enjoyed them, I am not sure I would order them again.

For entrees we ordered the truffled lobster mac 'n cheese, which was absoulutely AMAZING!!  It was so delicious! We also had the Gold Standard Burger, which we also really enjoyed.  I think it could do without the bacon, which I didn't even notice, but the aged goat cheddar is a great touch.

I have had a few burgers from Holstein's, and each burger is beyond phenomenal. This is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when I found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. Add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and I am all set to go.

The three burgers I've had at Holstein's are:

Burger of the Day: Short Rib Burger
This burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.

Gold Standard Burger: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli 

This burger should be the first burger you eat at Holstein's. Everything about it is right. You'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. No wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. Everyone we know that has come to Holstein's with us has loved this burger.

Captain Hook Burger:
Grilled Atlantic Salmon w\/Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Herb-Caper Mayo & House Cured Gravlax 

To be quite honest, I don't know what Gravlax is, but whatever it is I love it and will go back to Holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. The salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. If you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.

Go here. You will love every bite. If you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular french fries (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their sweet potato fries which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets sweet potato fries right. If you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. So, so good. Eat up and enjoy!",2,1,1

They don't even have their spiked milkshakes on the late night menu which was what I wanted to try the most after hearing so many good things about it. :( Booo. 

My bf and I reluctantly ordered the tiny burgers which are really really tiny! Tinier than your average sliders. The meat was super dry too. I really do not recommend them. Their homemade potato chips that came on the side were tasty though. But overall, NOT worth the money!

There was a DJ inside near the entrance which was pretty odd\/interesting... since nobody dances in there and it's not even really a lounge.. and it's right across from Marquee where you can go dance to a DJ if you wanted to.

The main gripe I have about my meal is that my meat was overcooked- even though I asked for medium rare (no pink to be found). Luckily, I split this burger so I only had to deal with half of it. Both times, I have tried the rising sun burger and that was a good choice. The onion rings and the shake (birthday shake) were both excellent- maybe you should just go to snack and get a shake... but the burger, I'm sure you can shop elsewhere. 

Service was good as they comped our shakes due to some trouble with our reservation. The decor is pretty interesting in here and sure to start some conversations.

Fresh from a Cosmopolitan Event at the Yard, their fourth floor pool, with ThreeKindsOfRumAndMangoPuree powerhouse drink in hand, my husband and I descended from up above for a burger at Holstein's.  Having attended a lot of beautiful, upscale, free functions at the Cosmopolitan, making it my favorite casino hotel, it was time to give back and actually patronize and pay for a meal there. 

Now I've traveled a good part of the world and most of the United States, and almost always have something drinkable in my hand, usually a Starbucks cup but, in a casino it's more likely a glass of wine after I've been gambling for a while.  Never, ever, ANYWHERE, have I been told that I can't bring an outside drink in.  This forced me either to leave the drink or chug-a-lug it.  Guess what I did?  But I wasn't happy.  The manager, when asked about their policy, was completely lame.  ""We don't want anyone to get drunk.""  Duh, is that why they have a full bar, complete with multiple flat screen TVs showing all manner of sports programs???  

Bad beginning.  But I have to tell you that my burger - the California Turkey burger - may have been the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Moist.  Perfectly seasoned.  On a bun that was dense, so it didn't turn to mush like at all the other burger joints.  With all the other good stuff, too:  guacamole, pepper jack cheese, a huge tomato slice that was actually red and ripe, and a bit of slaw.  The steak fries were crisp, hot, and stayed hot, probably due to the little metal pail they're served in.

My husband had Brisket Burger, a beef burger with a topping of juicy brisket in barbecue sauce.   He loved it.  He also loved his sweet potato fries, which were presented as one of the four potato options to accompany the burger.  But he wasn't told that there was a two-buck upcharge for them, which is a no-no in my book.

We didn't try the shakes, because we were too full from all the drinks and chips we stuffed ourselves with upstairs, but they look great.  

Our waitress was efficient, but not all that friendly, until she delivered the check.  Then it was all smiles and profuse thanks.  And we did appreciate the 15% discount for locals, though I'm not sure if it's a regular policy or because we bitched about the drinks.

Pretty cool that they have two openings, one with a host stand and the other used as an exit.  Definitely helps with the flow of traffic.

The four of us asked for a table and were seated immediately.  It's a bit loud and probably not a place you would want to go to if you're looking to have a meaningful conversation.

But to keep you entertained, you just need to look around and get a good laugh from awesome cartoons of cows and sexy pickles and sexy burger buns.

Checking into Yelp you get 50% off on all draft beers!  Making them about $5-6 each, probably one of the best deals you could get around the strip.  Just note that they require each person who is ordering beer to check in.

After placing our drink orders we were given a bucket of seasoned popcorn.  I've never seen popcorn be eaten so quickly before...  We placed out dinner orders and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The burgers were a decent size and come with a small bucket of fries.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious.

Our server was attentive but not overbearing.

The poké was $15 and had small cuts of fresh fish on top of mini round tortilla chips. Both burgers were about $20 and they were not as tender and juicy as we anticipated.

Holsteins is pretty pricey for what they are plating. I spent the same amount I would have spent if I had gone to Wicked Spoon.

I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.

What that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.

The Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).

My wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.

Each burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.

Our son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.

Even after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.

Despite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast.

I really have issues with places that seat people at awkward tables when they have other tables available, this is such a peeve of mine.

Patrons take their experiences and they way they feel treated seriously and restaurants should treat it as such, it's a package deal.

We ordered the Buffalo chicken dip and it was good but I wasn't crazy about the chips that came with it, but it was still good.

Okay so I do remember this place being mentioned on a TV show and the ""Billionaire Burger with 100% Kobe Beef,  Foie Gras, and Truffle mayo"" was ranted and raved about.  Fine.  I love Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, and am a Truffle man so I ordered it.  At $32 for a burger, this thing better be good.  Went for the Onion Rings for $2 more, $16.50 for the Lobster Mac and Cheese, $16 for Fried Pickles (not my choice), $16.50 for the Country fried Bacon, and my colleges ordered spiked shakes while I passed.

Lobster Mac and Cheese was, well, watery and just so so.  One of my friends loved the stuff.  The fried pickles reminded me of deep fried zucchini but crispy and salty. Another one of my friends lectured me about pickles and how good they were.  Okay.  The Country Fried Bacon stole the show for the appetizers.  This was a thick slice of pork belly and was oh so good.  4 total pieces were gone in seconds.

Now one friend ordered the Memphis Burger that had pulled pork on top of kobe beef and bbq sauce.  He was digging his burger.  Another guy had the Big Fat Greek which is Lamb and reminded him of the best gyro he's ever had.  The dude ordered lamb in a hamburger place.  Whatever.

My other buddy and I ordered the Billionaire Burger.  Okay so mind you, this friend frequents 3 Star Michelin Restaurants and runs bills over $400 for dinner.  I also enjoy fine dining so when he mention this restaurant...Anyway.  This quite possibly was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Yes I know it's a burger, yes I realize half the food on the table were deep fried, and again yes I know we were drinking milk shakes (they were not me) with our meals but WOW!

This Billionaire Burger was ridiculously stupid good.  It took me 25 minutes to finish it because I savored every bite, seriously.  I refused to drink anything so that the tastes can blend and linger in my mouth it was so good.  I couldn't believe I was eating a freaking hamburger that put a smile on my face so big my cheeks hurt.  I loved this burger so much I left a $20 tip.  

Not for the faint of heart when it comes to $$$, granted we drank, one of us heavily (again not me) with hard drinks and tried 1\/2 the menu but still a bit of sticker shock running up a $275 bill for 4 burgers, 10 mixed drinks, 2 shakes, and 3 appetizers.",1,1,1

We were quickly seated around 6 pm on a Thursday night and were immediately given a nice bucket of popcorn (which means I will have to break out the floss later). Service was very friendly and our waiter was spot on with recommendations. I had the Steakhouse Burger which was cooked to absolute perfection. Cooking a burger correctly isn't that easy but Holstein's seems to have to process down pat. The steak fries are highly recommended. They also have an impressive beer collection if you need something to accompany your burger.

Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don't get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can't stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, ""the best burgers in Vegas,"" and ""I Love Love Love Hoslteins"" were some of many glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.

The lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.

Upon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.

Quite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.

And now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn't have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a ""Kobe"" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.

If anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. ""You are in Vegas. Live a little!"", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.

Pretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can't associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn't think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.",0,1,0

I was pretty full and didn't try the drunken monkey but went for a strawberry shake at around $9.00 - probably due to the great people watching included. The service was a bit on the slower side but my friendly waitress said they only had one gal making shakes and she gets overwhelmed when it backs up - lol.  You wouldn't know it by the taste of this shake, thick and rich tasting and I like the fact that they gave me  the metal  container which was another half shake! So filling but one of the best shakes ever I've encountered

I'm looking forward to returning and checking out the lamb burger!",3,3,4

As soon as we were seated, we were asked about drinks.  Two people in our party ordered beer and the other two ordered water.  The beer came within 10 minutes.  The waters were served to us about 20 minutes later.  We asked 4 other staff members who WEREN'T our server (couldn't find him) for water and nothing.  Finally we thought if we order beer then maybe we'll get it before the water too?  Our beers came out WITH our water.  Now 30 minutes past being seated.

We managed to place our order when the beer came out.  Ordered a veggie patty, a Caesar salad and a well-done classic burger.

Our food didn't take nearly as long as our water to arrive and I understand why. When the ""well-done"" burger was but into,  it was more like cool blue and dripping with blood.  Not pinkish meat juice, it was dark red beef blood.  We flagged our waiter down and told him about it and he took the plate.  Our guest however was turned off from eating a burger like that and asked if she could order the sliders.  We were told no because it's for kids only.  Our server had his manager come over to explain that despite the raw ground beef our friend was just served he wasn't going to bend company policy and serve her sliders.  

We received no apologies from anyone, especially the manager who seemed to enjoy being as rude as he could over his kitchens failure.  

Between the service and the raw burger,  I can say this place was the skid mark of our vacation.

I gave this place 2 stars for the veggie patty and Caesar.  Those were pretty standard tasting.",4,2,2

The bill (comes with gratuity for 6 people) with a little extra was $114.

GOOD:
+ Food: Everything was tasty, juicy, flavorful, delicious. Everything looked beautiful as well, and the table comes with (instead of a basket of bread) a bucket of bbq popcorn. How fun! It was a great non-filling munching snack too (because you'll definitely want to save room for the delicious food).
+ Atmosphere: Very energetic, fun, a little colorful with a life-size hot pink cow statue... and very warm.  A good place to come with a group of people.
+ Service: Our server, Chaz, was super nice and shared a great story of how he was carded even though he's a super-tall guy.  He was quick, friendly, and very attentive.  Also, other servers we didn't know came by and picked up the empty plates fairly quickly.

BAD:
- Price: I would come here to try it once, which I did and I am glad I got to taste such a high-end delicious burger! But, really, a $16-$20 burger is craziness. Worth trying, once or twice! But craziness.  This is not a place for the kids (unless you're ready to spend more) because they probably won't even appreciate the high-quality burgers--I was a kid once, and honestly, a burger's a burger when I was little!! (And if you're not willing to spend a bit more at this joint, they'll probably go hungry.)

I have eaten burgers here on three different occasions.  It is convenient since I often stay at the Cosmo while in Vegas.

My first two times I was here, I was not impressed by their burgers.  This 3rd time, I ordered again their Rising Sun burger (Kobe beef, teriyaki sauce, yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado).  The combination of different flavors worked really well together and this burger is definitely a hit with me.  The bun, a standard burger bun, was a bit stiffer than I prefer but the overall goodness of the burger makes me overlook this minor shortcoming.  I strongly recommend trying this burger.

The fries were ordinary and need salt, imo.

Holsteins offers a good range of exotic beers which I always like to taste-test when I am out.  Perhaps about 15 beers on tap of non-standard-fare beers.

I'll admit, what drew me to Holstein's wasn't really the food...it was the boozy shakes. Drunken Monkey? Yes, please. And that's what I ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. Whoever thought to mix banana gelato and Frangelico deserves to be worshipped.

The food was equally as outstanding. When I ordered my Rising Sun burger ""medium rare to rare,"" my server warned, ""The rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. Would you prefer it warm or cold?"" And so I ordered it medium rare. And out it came, warm and red and juicy Kobe beef. I was shocked that for once I didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. The toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which I was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. The shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.

On top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in Vegas restaurants. Holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, IS good food to be found on the Strip, and I will certainly be returning here on my next trip.

Update: I FINALLY got back here and had the Gold Standard burger this time. A little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as the Rising Sun. Also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! I'm not as in love with Holsteins as I used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the Strip.

I can't deny that their burgers are delicious but depending on what time and server you get, your experience will depend on service.

I came to Holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great. Good service, good waiters and good food. The second time I came, it was horrrrrrrible!! The food was good as always. But the service was just terrible! The thing that angered me the most is that it was only our table receiving such bad service. We see others receiving their food promptly and watching the managers check up on them but when the manager came across our table, he straight turned away and ignored us!!! Didn't even ask if we were doing alright. Which we weren't! We waited forever to get our food and the waiter was pretty much non-existent to us! It took forever to get his attention and we even waited forever for our check even when we asked for it.

The third time, we learned better so we decided to order togo and eat in our rooms. That way, we don't have to deal with inconsistent service.

Anyways, as for the food. Definitely try the billionaire burger. Hey, you're in Vegas so go big or go home! The foie gras is perfectly seared and so flavorful and the combination of the onions and truffle sauce is sooo good! So worth the price! Only $28! If you want something a little bit reasonable, the rising sun, the fun-ghi and el machete are all delicious as well!

I was really craving a milkshake, and after eating at Jaleo in the Cosmopolitan, Holsteins was an easy choice! I have to have my drinks non-alcoholic these days, so I opted for a plain jane chocolate shake. I was expecting pedestrian and boring-they didn't really have any fun choices for non-alcoholic shakes, but my choco shake was anything but! It was creamy and decadent with gooey chocolate sauce on the bottom. The depth of flavor was surprising! 

Other friends had the frozen grasshopper, the campfire s'mores, and the vegan maple pecan shake. Everyone was very satisfied, and the table favorite seemed to be the campfire s'mores. Hands down.

Even though we had just eaten lunch at Jaleo, we did order some fries and fried pickles to go with the shakes. Both were delicious, and after having lukewarm, squirmy fries at Gordon Ramsey PUB, these fries were a welcome change of pace!

Holsteins is located right smack in the middle of the Cosmopolitan. There's really no signs leading to this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a dim little restaurant in the corner of the floor. It was around dinner time on a Saturday night and the wait was only 15 minutes. When our name was called we were told by the hostess to walk down to the dining room to be seated. I found this a bit STRANGE considering there were so many servers walking around- I didn't know which one would be seating us. After a few awkward eye contacts, we were greeted by a nice young lady and shown to our table. 

Food ordered:
Billionaire Burger (Kobe Beef and Foie Gras) - I didn't like how the Kobe Beef masked the flavor of the Foie Gras, but it was still delicious. The Foie Gras was truly something special. I would pay $28 for the piece alone (Yes, this burger was $28).
Urth Burger (House made veggie patty) - The veggie patty was a bit too mushy for my liking. I wanted a bit of a crunch, at least on the outer part of the patty. NOPE. The avocado didn't help the mushy theme either. The texture  wasn't pleasant at all. Don't get be wrong though, the flavors were definitely there. This burger went for $12-$15, I forgot. Not worth it.
Shoestring Fries - SO GOOD. I love crispy, semi-burnt things, so these fries were PERFECT for me. Not that I'm saying it was burnt... but it was VERY crunchy. These fries were very, VERY thinly sliced. For those who want to taste to potato, go for the steak cut fries.
Steak Cut Fries - Nothing too special about these fries. Very mediocre. Too much potato in my mouth!

The service was good. Dining was casual. Place is a bit dark, but it gives this place a nice vibe for a burger joint. In all, it was a good experience. Will come here again for the Billionaire Burger, nothing else. :)

Actually, I do remember a 45-minute wait for lunch, generally slow service and some very mediocre food.  My Rising Sun Burger (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo and Tempura Avocado) sounded amazing on paper but was super dry, and surprisingly bland.

If you do get a burger, their skinny fries are better than the steak fries.  Pass on the Lobster Truffle Mac & Cheese.  Not worth the price, no truffle flavor and the cheese was runny.  At least the Black & White Milk Shake was good.

The shakes here are spiked with liquor and they are so delicious! They've got 10+ different shakes to chose from, which makes it difficult, but we finally narrowed it down to the birthday cake shake and the creme brulee shake. Both were amazingly yummy. The birthday cake has bits of cake in it to give it great texture. They both tasted great and the alcohol was just the right amount - not too overpowering. And the whipped cream on top was delicious too. 

The food was excellent too. I loved the lobster mac and cheese. We also got the Fun-ghi burger - which came with mushrooms and gruyere cheese - and it was very tasty. We also tried the pork belly sliders, which came on the white buns that baos come in and those were good too.

The hostess told us that we could sit at the bar or the dining area, both of which have tvs. I had the Gold Standard burger ($18.50) and my friend had the big fat greek burger($18) with $2 sub sweet potato fries. We also shared the Tiramisu shake ($13). When the shake came out, our waiter gave us a steel mixing cup and a glass cup with the shake. I was wondering what that steel cup was and when I looked inside it was more of the shake. I guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us. The shake was pretty good and less sweet (thank God) than the shakes at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. The burgers came out pretty quick (maybe in 10-15 minutes). It wasn't that busy so that helped. The fries come out in a small, aluminum bucket which is kinda unique. The Gold Standard burger was great. I liked especially the arugula and the tomato confit. Those veges balanced the heavy flavors of the bacon, cheese, and burger. Unfortunately, I noticed the fries at the middle and bottom of my bucket were a little soggy and oily. I tried my friend's greek burger which had greek spiced lamb. She had the tsaziki sauce on the side and I thought that was a good decision especially for this burger. The sauce had mint in it and my friend didn't like it. I, on the other hand, thought it worked bc I've hand lamb with mint jelly before. My friend told the waiter she didn't like the tsaziki sauce and the waiter was kind enough to bring out a cajun remoulade sauce instead. That cajun remoulade sauce was pretty good and tasted like thousand island with some cajun seasoning. My friend's sweet potato fries were great as they were crispy and did not taste oily at all.

Third awesome thing about this place is literally everything on the menu. 
Alcoholic milkshakes? Yes. Crazy flavors that actually work together and just in case you couldn't find enough things on the strip with alcohol in them, here are some more.
Gourmet burgers? Yes. Fusion burgers of many kinds, as well as more traditional.
Above average fries? Very much above average but not stellar. 
I ordered the funky monkey milkshake, or whichever one has peanut butter, banana, and chocolate. I love banana, but I was feeling the peanut butter mood this night, so I compromised. You can hardly taste the alcohol though, because of the chocolate. Still delicious.
I also ordered the bacon cheeseburger with arugula. Though basic, it was definitely a memorable burger. Thick bacon, good cheese, well-cooked patty, fresh arugula. 100%.
My boyfriend ordered the bananas foster milkshake, which was good but the alcohol in that milkshake is too noticeable. He also ordered the kobe burger with fried avocado. It was an interesting combination of flavors, which were good, but I wouldn't ever order it and I'm glad I only had a taste.

The Rising Sun burger with the Kobe beef is tremendous. It is juicy and flavorful. My only knock on it is I wish it had something sweet to go along with it like a tomato. The avocado adds a nice touch to it though.  The fries were good but nothing exceptional. Definitely come here for the burgers. I didn't get a shake but I assume it's good if it's in the name. 

Would definitely come back if in Vegas.

To our disappointment though, we had requested no mayo, but both burgers had mayo on them. We waited to see our server, but it was apparent that it would be faster to go ahead and just scrape it off ourselves. I took a bite of my burger and the meat was very tough. I asked my friend and she thought the same thing. The bread looked fantastic, but it was a bit too chewy and hard to eat. We both ended up only eating half of our burgers. Our server was very nice, but he only checked on us the minute our food came before we even tasted it and we didn't see him for another 20 minutes when we were already finished for our meal.

Based on many recommendations, I decided to try Holstein's.  Sadly, Holstein's was another over hyped place for me.  I got the rising sun - the burger with avocado tempura, sweet potato shavings, and a teriyaki-like sauce. I tend to stay away from Asian fusion stuff, but this burger seemed to be quite popular per my friends and Yelp.  

The burger was decent, but I had a few problems with it.  1) The avocado tempura was tiny - it only covered about half of the patty, so I only was able to taste avocado with half of my burger.  2) The patty is pretty flimsy.  Not meaty enough for me.  Definitely overcooked for medium rare.  3) The bun was nothing to write home about.  In a perfect burger, the bun adds texture, balance, and cohesion.  But, in this burger, it  didn't add any of that for me.  I wish that the bun were warmer or better toasted.  4) The fries were not good.  They came with the burger, so I'm glad that I didn't need to pay extra or else I would have been more disappointed.  They were not crisp enough, so I actually left some of them behind.  Anyone who knows me knows that I never leave fries behind.  

All in all, the taste of the burger was fine, but definitely overpriced for what you get.  This is to be expected as we are talking about a meal on the Strip.  I have had far more delicious burgers in LA.  I was definitely not impressed with the service either.  A little too pretentious for  my taste.",3,2,2

I was lucky enough to come here a second time with my BESTEST FOODIE FRIEND, Rob M. (LL Cool Mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (I told you I was a busy girl). It wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. On our way back to our table I spotted the server we had last time...The lovely NOELLE. Noelle is what every server should aspire to be. She is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. If you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). We had the most amazing food:
-New Belgium Hoptober beer
-Lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a MUST...you will be licking the plate clean)
-Mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a wild mushroom demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor)
-The Gold Standard burger (what they are famous for...I can see why)
-The Drunken Monkey adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. They loved it)
-Maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow I died and went to heaven).

Now the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. Good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. I appreciated the wait time in between courses so I could digest and really enjoy all my food. If you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. Also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. You are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. If you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that. 

I will be back soon and hopefully Miss Noelle will be our girl again.",8,2,3

In fairness, I didn't get a burger because I was stuffed so I probably suffered from a case of ordering the wrong thing. Lesson learned: don't order a salad at a burger joint. My boyfriend loved his burger, on the other hand, and had the option to add a fried egg. I did notice that the burgers are a little bit on the small side for the price. 

There are TONS of beer choices as well. Love that they served pizza-flavored popcorn as a free appetizer. The buffalo chicken dip was amazing and a must-order appetizer (ask for extra chips if you need them).

We waited a while before being seated, despite the fact that there were numerous open tables and TONS of staff just STANDING AROUND.

It took about 15 minutes before anyone approached us. Staff was EXTREMELY disorganized, but I'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.

Our food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right. My medium well burger was pretty charred and extremely overcooked (well done).

THEN, MY FRIEND PULLED OUT A HAIR FROM HER BURGER!!!!!

We told one of our waiters (won't even get into the confusion with this), who informed the manager and told us he would speak to us. The manager never approached us. At this point, we were extremely fed up. After the waiter spoke to him again, the manager came to our table, apologized and asked to replace the meal. We ordered our friend a chicken caesar salad salad and a shake since the poor thing hardly had a quarter of her burger.

Our waiter brought out the salad and shake to go along with our bill and informed us that the manager would not exclude the shake from our bill. Considering the above events, this was pretty ridiculous. 

On top of it all, there was no chicken on the salad.

The restaurant was brightly lit and loud.  There was a game on the televisions in the bar, and as a result, the bar was packed.  After waiting ten minutes for a table, we were seated at a comfortable table.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  She acknowledged us promptly and took our drink orders.  She provided several suggestions, and when I asked about the Nom Nom burger, she informed me that it was done as a charity promotion but was so popular, they kept it on the menu.  

After serving us drinks, she provided us with a small bucket of popcorn.  Cute. And tasty.  I am sort of a popcorn kind of guy.  You probably didn't know that about me, and probably didn't want to know that about me. There are more things I can share, but I won't.  The popcorn was fresh and warm.  It also had a distinct flavor that was hard to place.  I thought it could have been a pickle flavor seasoning.  Hey, I am at a burger place, right?  It was salt and vinegar.  Tasty.

The burgers came out quickly, and cooked to specification.  I asked for a little bit of pink, and that is what I got.  I had the Nom Nom burger.  It was tasty.  It could have been better.  The menu billed it as Kobe Beef.  At $16.50 for an 8 ounce burger, I can assure you this is not authentic Kobe Beef.  The first Kobe Beef in the last two years in Vegas is at City Center.  They are charging $35 an ounce.  So, maybe they are billing the Wagyu as Kobe Beef.  Or maybe it is the Kobe style beef.  Who knows.  I just know it wasn't what was billed.  

We skipped the booze because we were trying to eat on the cheap.  A diet Coke, an iced tea, and two sandwiches came out to $42.  A little pricey in my opinion.  But, considering where I am, I don't mind paying for it.

The burger, as I mentioned was cooked perfectly.  The bun was firm, but a little on the plain and boring side.  The fries, I got the shoe string, my companion got the thick fries, were hot, salted and well seasoned.  I preferred the shoe string fries over the thick fries.  So did my friend.  The burger was topped with white cheddar, potato chips and Thousand Island.  There was barely any sauce.  The chips covered the perfectly melted cheese.  I was surprised that there was no additional garnish present.  No pickle, tomato, onion or lettuce on the plate.  Not even a sprig of parsley.  At these prices, surely they could toss something in.  Applebee's even garnishes their plates with a sprig of inedible, icky kale.

I didn't get a chance to sample the liquor malts, but rest assured, next time I go, I won't be driving, so I will definitely take a taste.",0,0,0

I headed to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Located on the second level, it fits right in with the other contemporary dining options there.

I ordered the Gold Standard ($18), a dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and a garlic-chive aioli which I got on the side. The burger was thick, juicy, and flavorful. The bacon and goat cheese complimented the meat well, although a standard cheddar or american cheese would've worked probably even better in my opinion. I added some of the aioli which created a unique taste on the burger that I hadn't had before while the arugula added a little freshness to the sandwich.

It was nice that the burger was served with fries but they weren't very good. For the most part, they were overly crispy on the outside and some of the fries were clumped and mushy on the inside. But, I guess the name of the place boasts what they do best and that doesn't include fries. 

The burger and shake were really good. I actually wanted a cookies and cream shake but it was only available on the ""bam-boozled shakes"" menu so I settled on a banana split shake ($9). Most times, these taste like either banana or strawberry or chocolate shakes. Holsteins did a nice job actually combining the flavors in the thick and creamy shake. There were pieces of banana in the shake, chocolate was drizzled in the glass, and the strawberry flavor came through in the shake as well. It was all topped with whipped cream, candy confetti, and a cherry. They also brought me the ""extra"" shake in the mixing cup...awesome!

I sat at the bar and service was efficient and very pleasant. They checked on me multiple times to ensure that I had everything that I needed and that the food was to my liking. This was a pricey burger, fries, and shake but it was worth it.",16,6,15

First off, the decor is really modern with colorful drawings of the astronaut cows. Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:

Gold standard- 4\/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.

Rising Sun- 4.5\/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.

Smores milk shake- 4\/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.

We showed up around 7pm on a Saturday, and there wasn't a wait. We should have taken this as a bad sign... 

The FOOD: Since we weren't that hunger, we just ordered the guacamole with pita chips for an appetizer and the hen house burger for an entree. The guacamole and pita chips were good, but nothing special. Also, there were way more chips than guacamole.. wasn't impressed. Then theres the burger. My first impression was that it was TINY for a $14 burger, but I thought the taste would make up for it. I take my first bite and...... BLAND! The flavor of the meat was nothing special and you could hardly even taste the egg in the burger. I have tried burgers from many different burger joints, and this burger does NOT even come close to being considered one of the best!

The SERVICE: Other reviews say they received popcorn once they were seated, we did not; I guess their popcorn machine was broken that night! The servers were nice, but the service itself wasn't that great. After we were almost done with our food, our server did not come by once to ask if we'd like a refill. I didn't even get my water refill until AFTER the she brought us the check; I had been running on empty for about 10 minutes. Also, it took a while for her to get our bill straightened out (probably about 15 minutes), and the place wasn't even fully busy.

Offerings such as the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, Maine Lobster Roll, Tenderloin Rossini, and Maine Lobster Roll tantalize the taste buds.  I would recommend the Crispy Pork Belly Bun.

One thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.

I ordered the Longhorn Burger, which comes with beef brisket on top. This was $17, but it also came with fries (Although if you wanted to substitute for sweet potato fries it's an extra $2.50). Now for a place that specializes in meat quality, this actually isn't that bad. And the fries are tasty too!

As good as Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is, this would only be about $2-$3 more for way more food. And the patty is actually a little bigger. My recommendation is to get it medium-rare.

However, the burger isn't quite as good. Although the meat quality is exceptional, it lacked the flavor that many other gourmet burger spots would have. All the taste came from the brisket and the barbecue sauce. 

There were too many ingredients on the burger itself. But I took the coleslaw and pickles out and it was perfect--one of the best barbecue burgers I've had.

I ordered the Gold Standard--a beef sirloin burger with bacon, goat cheddar, tomato, arugula, and garlic aioli. The burger was pretty good, and it was EXTREMELY filling. I couldn't finish it! The fries that came with the entrée were also bomb! I also ordered a Campfire S'mores milkshake; to be honest, I thought the shake tasted better than the burger. On top of that, the shake was infused with some alcohol, so great if you're looking for a dangerous turn-up desse

Our server, Dean, was extremely hospitable and accommodating. Our group had to temporarily leave the restaurant because we wanted to needed to get into Marquee before a certain time if we wanted to get in for free. We got the call to get in line for Marquee right when our food arrived, so imagine how chaotic we were figuring out what to do. Dean was extremely understanding and made sure our table of food was not cleaned up, so props to him for demonstrating great service to a bunch of drunk kids! We made it back to our table to continue eating 15 minutes later...",0,0,0

That said I've tried the Gold Standard, The Steakhouse and the Nom Nom burgers here and all have great flavor combinations that still allow the flavor of the beef to be savored. The rest of the menu has some interesting looking items I hope to try if I ever  can resist ordering another burger, the Cuban Street Tacos and Truffle Lobster Mac N Cheese are very tempting. And of course don't forget to try a shake, yummy yummy goodness in a glass.

My friend made reservations in advance for a party of six people. Our hostess led us to the back of the restaurant to a cozy booth with additional chairs on the outskirts, which accommodated our party nicely. There weren't many people dining there at 7:00pm on a Wednesday, which was nice because we did receive a lot of attentive service from the waitstaff. 


FOOD
+ Oreo Milkshake: Started the evening off with a tall glass of this shake made from crushed Oreos and Bailey's Irish Cream. If you're concerned that you're going to receive a mouthful of booze, you won't. There was only a hint of Bailey's that I could detect. Rather than one ingredient dominating over the other, both blended nicely to create a creamy, concoction. 

+ Rising Sun Burger: Order the optional egg with this burger. Trust me. It's what makes it bomb. But even if you don't like eggs, this burger is solid. A little on the dense side. I wasn't sure if that was due to the thickness of the meat patty or the tempura avocado and yam toppings, but I had a tough time taking bites. I can't say if I enjoyed the sweetness of the teriyaki glaze. I think there was too much of it slathered onto my Kobe beef patty. Just a light amount brushed over the patty would've been perfect for my tastes. Other than that criticism, that didn't stop me from eating the entire burger and the side of fries.

SERVICE
Great service. Our server was friendly and patient, and she even placed a birthday candle on top of my friend's Drunken Monkey shake. Nice touch. 

OVERALL
Food and service were on the spot. There's no doubt that I'll be making a return trip to try more of their burgers and shakes.",5,2,3

Food yet again great. Service was fair. 

Food:
- Kobe beef with teriyaki and tempura avocado: had to get this again and again it was great. Sweet potato fries were not burnt this time!
- Drunken Monkey shake: very tasty, fresh like banana, but barely tasted the alcohol
- Tomato & Feta Salad: if you don't like olives, don't get this. I personally am not a fan of olives, so while everything was fresh tasting , the olives overpowered everything. 
- Lobster Mac & Cheese with Truffle Oil: Yummy!!! The lobster flavor was a little muted, but overall very tasty dish. Didn't have that heavy taste to it. Came with a cute little mini lobster BLT.

We got seated pretty fast and saw the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The waiter came around and was friendly. We all asked for waters. Twenty minutes later, we get three waters. He says, ""I'm sorry, I can't count. I'll bring out another right away."" After fifteen minutes have past, we had to ask someone, who appeared to be the manager, for another water. He quickly brought out another water which we were thankful for. Anyways, it took us another ten minutes to order. Now once we did, we did not get our food until probably 30-40 minutes. Our waiter was seen talking to another server against the wall. We couldn't tell if he was flirting as it appeared but either way he never came by our table once. My friend's water spilled and everyone except our server were at our table helping us. It was so kind of this one man to dry off our table. I'm sure it happens often but again we were grateful for this man. Our waiter finally comes out with our food and says, ""I'll be back to fill those waters."" He never comes back until we are absolutely finished we our food. The fries were great but the Kobe beef was so dry we completely finished our waters. We had to ask another server for our server to refill our waters. Seriously? Mind you, the restaurant was not busy at all. We were so irritated by our server. The only time he asked us if we needed anything was when we were absolutely done with our food. Our waiter later has the audacity to ask my friend, who's check was $6 if we wanted change back since he gave the waiter a $20. Seriously again? A $14 tip when you never came by our table, was flirting with your co worker, AND never was to be seen in a not so busy restaurant. He was so instant we give him a large tip. Of course, we were going to tip him. I'm assuming he thought since we aren't older looking, that we wouldn't tip. What we should've done was tip him before and ask to be taken care of. Lesson learned, always tip first. Thanks Carlo, you seriously was amazing.",1,1,0

We stopped in for lunch after reading the rave reviews -- the burgers intrigued the boyfriend, and I was sold on the boozy shakes. There is cute cow decor everywhere, which makes you feel almost a little bit guilty about devouring its friend in burger form.

We sat down at a table by the bar and ordered the Rising Sun burger, poutine with a fried egg, and a Campfire S'mores shake, bam-boozled of course. The Rising Sun is SO on point -- perfectly cooked kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Is there anything more that you need for a burger? The perfect side of fries? Yes, that's there, too. The poutine was also jam-packed with flavor, but it got to be a bit too salty by the end.

That boozy shake though? The BEST. The magic inside the Campfire S'mores shake includes marshmallow vodka, graham cracker, chocolate sauce, toasted marshmallow, s'mores candy stick, s'mores chocolate balls, chocolate covered graham crackers, vanilla frosting, graham crumble. Oh yes. ALL of that. If there was any time that you wanted to treat yo'self to something sweet, this would be the time to do it. There's just enough alcohol to taste it in the background, but the sugar overload will have you wired regardless. All of their shakes are massive so I definitely recommend grabbing a friend or two to share.",2,2,2

One of the great miracles of Las Vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like ""Sexy And I Know It"", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. Holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as Public House, where I had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. The décor here is also just dope. I love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. If you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so I suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.

But, since it's Vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). Brian and I both took the luxury route on the menu here, although I passed on the Billionaire Burger with Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because I've already had half a dozen burgers like this across America and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. It was honestly more difficult passing up the Rising Sun burger, a truly unique combination of Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if I had been dining with someone I was dating I likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. Somehow I managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.

I finally wound up deciding on the Gold Standard burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with foie gras. The result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers I've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done sweet potato fries (for a supplemental charge). My biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer the burgers with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. Eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a fried egg as I do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.

Just make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.",14,14,11

It was a Sunday on a holiday weekend so it was fairly busy, we put our name in and they take your phone number so they can send a text when your table is ready. Went and played some slots for a half hour and BOOM, got a text, awesome.

I ordered a Pretty simple burger, bacon cheese and a very good garlic sauce. I love that their burgers come with fries, so much easier to pay the ""Burger bar"" prices when it comes with a side. The burger was very good, perfectly cooked and great accompaniments.

Either way, it definitely seems like the place gets a lot of action. Gotta love the decor of the place: cartoon cows 

We had the Thai Beef Salad, the Gold Standard, and the Oreo shake. Watch out for the Thai Beef Salad! It's good but it has a sweet\/super spicy sauce mixed into it... it tasted a lot like Korean gochujang. The Gold Standard lived exactly to its expectations, but what else would expect from a $20 burger? And the Oreo shake was the perfect mix of thick consistency: not too watery but not thick enough that you feel like you need to suck your brains out through the straw.

Burgers are large, and the bottom bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. Fries were similarly salty.

- Bachi Burger is a bit better. But they're pretty close!
- This is better than Gordon Ramsay's BURGR.

Positives:
+Amazing burgers! Lots of variety, juicy meat, awesome ingredients and toppings that you can add, etc. 
+ Amazing milkshakes. Both alcoholic and non alcoholic. We had the tiramisu and the cookies and cream alcoholic ones. Super yummy.
+ The Mac and cheese was frickin' delicious! Omg I could eat that stuff forever. Bonus: it had lobster in it!
+ Cool atmosphere. 
+ Our waitress once we got seated at an actual table was really attentive, nice, and she was great. Definitely helped make up for the bad things at the beginning of our experience 

Negatives, kinda went over it but I'll go over it again:
- hostess lost our place in line, or didn't bother putting our names down to begin with.
- We were offered a table in the lounge area. Sat there for about fifteen minutes and no one paid us any attention.

People often get hung up on the new trend of gourmet burgers, and they can be great, but one thing you have to remember is that it has to be knock you off your feet good if you're going to charge more than the average burger.  I think there is a special place burger fans keep in their heart for a good burger.  Maybe it's because we love them so much we're always searching for a better burger experience.  I just want a burger that scratches that itch and is savory, juicy, and good.  I've had upscale burgers that do that for me and I am no stranger to a good In-N-out.  It just has to be good, it doesn't have to be expensive.  I honestly love burgers so much I would eat one out of the back of somebodies trunk if it was damn good.  Holsteins has disappointing me twice with different burgers, and each time has giving me the weirdest stomach pains.  I'm just not a fan of this place.  Each time I leave I just wish I went to one of the other great burger places in Vegas.  Maybe I'm not who they are trying to get with their brand of food, because I do like some of their other items that aren't burgers.  Do you come to a place that touts burgers and shakes for their side dishes though?  No you come for that slab of meat in between two buns.  I don't care how much kitschy items you pile on to it it still has to be good at its core.  So hold the aioli sauce, take off the shiitake mushrooms, and 86 the truffles or whatever you want to try to spruce up the burger.  Make your burgers something I crave and I'll be back in, meanwhile you can find me at one of the great burger  food trucks or in-N-out with grease all over my fingers.",2,0,0

--

Ok well they only kind of suck because I did enjoy my milkshake and the awesome steak fries, but everything else was a HUGE disappointment especially my burger.  I guess my beef with Holsteins (pun intended) was that my burger came out almost well done when I ordered it medium rare.  Yeah I should have sent it back but I was STARVING and didn't want to get an extra topping in my burger if you know what I mean.  So I scarfed it down and here I am now on Yelp LOL!  

And it doesn't stop there. I also had the absolute WORST lobster roll of my life here.  In fact, I wouldn't even consider it a lobster roll, more like a little bit of lobster inside a huge untoasted unbuttered cold stale roll with bbq marks as if it was on the grill trying to pass itself off as a lobster roll, so do me a favor y'all actually do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER this unless of course you want a little more disappointment in your life, because if that's what you need then by all means have at it...

Yeah it looks nice and they have cool art an shit to confuse your taste buds, but the truth of the matter is I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, even someone I didn't like.  You're better off gambling your money away or spending it on booze or strippers or giant guitar shaped margaritas or ziplining on Fremont Street.  Hell for the price I paid here I think I could have gotten a day pass for ziplining, which I promise you would have been a whole helluva lot more enjoyable than anything here (except for the milkshakes).",5,6,6

I couldn't not get a shake. Seriously, even after a day of drinking. Even though I knew it could potentially be a bad idea later. I had to get a shake! I mean, it's in the name! So I settled on the Campfire S'Mores shake (Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow, Graham Crumble). It was not an easy choice, but i was very happy after the first sip. I sampled the Birthday Cake one (which I wavered between) and felt that the S'Mores one definitely had more flavor. At $11 a pop, it's not cheap, but I do appreciate they give you a tin with extra shake in it!

For dinner I knew right away I wanted The Fun-Ghi (Beef Patty, Roasted Portabello, Carmelized Onion, Truffle Oil, Gruyere, Frisee, Aioli). It was pretty awesome! I hate when you order a mushroom burger and there's barely any mushrooms. Thankfully there were plenty, and it was marinated to perfection. Plus, the fries weren't too shabby either. For $16.5, it's a pricey burger, but hey, it's Vegas baby!

Instead of being seated at a table set for five with plenty of room we were placed at a cramped set of two tables for two with a spare chair assigned for the fifth individual. Most distressing was that she readily admitted this, told us that we would not be given the originally designated table and did it directly in front of us, and apparently because their staff spilled an drink on one of our party. This reeks of insufficient, inadequate, or uncaring trading and goes beyond the pale. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the food is quite good. The service needs severe revision.",0,0,0

We arrived around 630 and had no wait at all to be seated as a party of 4. Loved the funky feel of the decor it stood amongst the rest of the trendy burger place popped up all over Vegas lately. 

For starters we got the chicken buffalo dip (must try!), the lobster mac n cheese (I'm not much a seafood person and I still enjoyed it), and the fried pickles (who doesn't like fried pickles). The GM (Sergio) came over and greeted us and was very helpful giving his suggestions as to what to order. For entrees the other 3 in the group all ordered the ""rising sun"" and per Sergio's suggestion my hubby added a fried egg. I went against the stream and ordered the ""korean bullgogi"". All of us were speachless when the food arrived and all agreed it would be awhile before we could ever eat a burger from anywhere else cause we didnt want to tarnish the taste of these burgers!

Before heading out my girlfriend and I ordered some of the adult shakes to go. She got the grasshopper and I ordered the guava float. Both again were well worth the cost of $11 (really a steal considering you'll pay about $15 for a red bull\/ vodka at a casino floor bar). 

Yes the prices may be a bit much for burgers but really wasn't isn't pricey about Vegas anymore! And for the freshness and quality you get at Holsteins its well worth every penny.

I ordered the Golden Standard and of course I had to add an egg. With all the unique ingredients, I thought this burger was going to be awesome; but surprisingly it lacked the flavor I was looking for. I honestly think they need to season their meat a little more because I ordered the meat medium rare and it was dry. The burger just didn't ""wow"" me. 

I also up charged for the onion rings, and those weren't impressive at all. They taste like regular onion rings that you would get at a typical burger place. I unfortunately didn't have room to order their famous alcoholic shakes.

I did like The Gold Standard, but I don't eat bacon so I ate my half without it. I'm sure that took away from the flavor because although I did enjoy it, I didn't think it was mindblowingly delicious or that flavorful.
Something that kinda threw me off was the patties. We ordered medium rare, but they were cooked pretty medium. I think they would have been all the more juicy and delicious had they been cooked a bit less!

The Cosmopolitan hotel is an upscale establishment located in the new City Center development.  We were staying at the Belllagio, and the Cosmpolitan was right next door.

The restaurant is located on the second floor.  It was a bit loud and chaotic when we got there--which is probably to be expected on a busy Friday in Vegas.

I started with the Cereal Bowl--an incredible vanilla milkshake with vanilla vodka and CAPTAIN CRUNCH mixed in--awesome--though not super potent from an alcohol standpoint.

I had the Hen House burger--which is a burger with bacon and fried egg on top, and I added American cheese.  The burger was fantastic, cooked to order, and served with seasoned steak fries which were a bit dull compared with the rest of the food (you can order shoestring fries instead).  As said in another review--the juiciness of the burger definitely soaked the bottom bun making it a bit unappetizing.

From a service standpoint we were seated immediately, and then there was some confusion as one server took our drink order--which took about 10 minutes to fill, and another server then took over.   After that the server was quite attentive despite being very busy.

There was a baseball game and football game going on, so the bar\/lounge area (which is right up front) was loud and rowdy.

The Rising Sun has a Kobe beef patty, tempura avocado (love it!), nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and teriyaki glaze. It also comes with a side of fries.

This conclusion didn't arise until a particularly high volume of repeated similar questions.  That strong indicator surmised each time a ""How was Vegas?"" came up.   

One of my favorite landing spots was Holsteins.  Who doesn't like a good burger?  A vegetarian may raise their hand.  Even then, these burgers may sway the opinion of the strongest vegetarian for one meal.  

We moseyed on in around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch.  

Opening up the menu, besides the fascinating selection of shakes were the prices.  Expect price ranges to reach double digits.  I was really tuned into the Rising Sun so I got that.  Our waiter persuaded Bun into ordering their award winning burger.  I'm sure the fact the waiter was good looking had nothing to do with her decision either.  I just want to throw that out there for giggles.
  
Generally, I dislike teriyaki sauce.  The Rising Sun I ordered really shed a new light on my view of it.  Glazed with a teriyaki sauce, it meshed amazingly with the spicy mayo.  ""Kobe beef"", honestly labeled or not, was cooked medium on request.  Biting down to notice a dash of furikake was probably the biggest glowing surprise.  Lastly, the best part of the burger was certainly the tempura avocado.  Not only adding a different layer of texture, it added a good combined taste.  Come on.  Who doesn't like tempura?  

Add all that up produces an ultra surreal burger experience.  

As a side note since note, Bun's Gold Standard was a big thumbs up.  In her case, you could say little thumbs up.  Speechless through the first few bites, she almost finished the burger.  I'll have to try it next time.  Knowing me, I'd end up getting the Rising Sun again since it was so good.
 
Bright graphics on the wall are very energetic and lively.  Service was cordial.  It conveyed a vibe of a high class Hooter's.  That is with 10,000% better food, minus the Hooter's girls of course.

They served a really light beer, I really enjoyed it, it was refreshing, luckily I had this to wash down my burger.

I ordered the Gold Standard. I like how the burger was well-intact when I cut it and half and ate it. Cleaniness makes a world of difference. I ordered the burger medium, and it looked pink and medium (while my friend also ordered medium, but her's looked more well done), but it was extremely dry. It was too dry to taste the quality of the patty. Perhaps, it was because the patty was aged, so the flavors were more definitive, but I wonder that's why it made the patty way too dry. Don't get me wrong, the flavors of the burger were bold and tasted pretty good. It came well together, and the goat cheese cheddar stood out in a good way. Pretty delicious burger, except for the fact the patty was really dry and it's overpriced.

The fries were cold and also tasted old.

I did however try my friend's Rising Sun burger, that tasted good. The flavors were once again bold, and it had a pretty unique taste that stands out. I liked that one more.

Comparing this burger with like a Father's Office or Umami (I do not like Umami), it tastes about the same (although I like Father's Office the best), quality and unique taste-wise, they're all about equilavent, except those other burgers costs $13-14, while here it costs $17. Not sure if it's worth it. At least it made me not feel as bad paying $13-14 for the burgers at the other places now.

We browsed yelp reviews and looked through the menu prior to getting here, and were really excited to try the selection, but most of us left disappointed.  Luckily, I think I got the best burger of the bunch (The Rising Sun Burger!).

The Rising Sun Burger is an Asian-inspired burger so I loved the sweet, salty flavors.  The fried avocado and addition of tempura added a wonderful element to it.  I also added an additional egg on mine.  However, I think the key to a GREAT burger is the meat patty, and this is where Holsteins fell short with ALL our burgers.  Mine ""supposedly"" had a kobe beef patty, but I would've never known the difference because in-n-out serves a better patty.  They asked us how we wanted our patties cooked, and all of us went with medium-rare, but they were all overcooked.  Our patties tasted dry and flavorless.

Our group shared two appetizers - the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese and the Wings.  Both were mediocre.  The mac 'n cheese was runny, there was barely any lobster in it, and the portion was tiny.  Not worth the high price tag.  The wings were your standard wings - I think Wingstop wings are just as good.

If you use foursquare, you can check in for a free beer or margarita with signature burger purchase, and that works for every member of the party- pretty cool. My group of 6 took advantage of that. 

The free margarita is pretty dang small, and you get no choice in flavor, so I would go with a beer.

The bar and lounge area are extremely loud. There is no way you could have a conversation. The restaurant is quieter, but it's still hard to hear at times. 

The Strip pricing is the killer here. You should not have to pay this much for a burger and fries. I wouldn't come back specifically for that reason.",0,0,0

After a long hiatus from Vegas, it definitely feels good to finally grab a bite at this place with some good food and company.

For my most recent visit, I came with a party of 8 on a Saturday at 2pm and we were all seated right away. It was clear that we all just got out of the pool and were semi-dry so it was nice that they were willing to seat us (but I still recommend to clean up as much as you can for any business!). The place is more on the casual side but does have some hints of elegance (because it's Vegas!). There's bright color cartoon pictures and paintings along the walls, making this place lots of fun to look at. Once you're seated, you are greeted with a small tin of popcorn, which is jam-packed with flavor from all the spices and herbs they use.

I usually get their beef burgers (super delicious and juicy btw!) but this time wanted to try something different. This time I decided to split their Crazy Bird burger (Chicken) and Urth burger (Vegan) with a friend. The Crazy Bird had a decent amount of chicken to it but did lack a little bit of seasoning for my liking. The Urth burger, on the other hand, had an intriguing flavor to it and the consistently of the patty had a great mushy consistency to it (don't know how else to describe it but if you're Vegan, you will definitely enjoy this burger!). Also warning: fries that come with the burgers are super addicting and made fresh. 

It's also a must to try one of the ""Bam-Boozled"" milkshake at this place! They're known for their strategic use of booze (it really sneaks up on you hint hint) but you can also get any milkshake alcohol-free. Their milkshakes are pretty top-notch and I've tried most of them with and without the booze. One thing that impressed me during this visit was how they elevated the look of their milkshakes with all the sweet decorations but it's definitely more for pics than it is for taste. Their milkshakes are pretty big and can feel heavy with your meal so highly recommend sharing all the sweetness with someone.

I usually spend around $25-$30 including for a burger and milkshake depending on whether if I decide to sub for Sweet Potato fries and which burger I order. Will be looking forward to coming back to this place during my next Vegas trip.",8,5,6

My boss ordered them and I ate three of the five because he is annoying. My Green Pasture salad was pretty boring as one would expect and the Pork Street taco apps and Onion Rings (huge) were phenomenal. I ended up going with a vodka soda fas mentioned and they were pouring those suckers stiff! I'd like to say thank you for that.  My only regret is I did not get the spiked Grasshopper Milkshake.

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!

I had the Gold Standard burger which was EXCELLENT even though overpriced but I can not give this place more than 1 star due to the horrible service.

After sitting down our server took about 5 minutes to come greet us, which is understandable being it was busy. In a rush, we had our order ready and she walked away with our order. 10 minutes go by and we are not yet served our drinks. Finally our drinks come and the burger hits the table. But, we didn't have our silverware yet! So the food runner brought us silverware since our waitress was no where to be found. During our meal the waitress never came to check if our burger was good. Not once! 

After we were finished eating we sat around for about 10-15 minutes waiting with empty water glasses to ask for the check. Our waitress was no where to be found!  We asked the host to grab our waitress for the check and we saw him walk over to the center of the restaurant to look for her. Another 10 minutes go by and he couldn't find her. At this point, I walked up to the bar and asked if I could pay my bill there but unfortunately I couldn't. 

Another 10 minutes go by and we see the host finally find our waitress. She drops the check off after 5 minutes and I hand it right back to her with a card. We watch her go take a drink order from another table and come back with the drinks for that table.. But, she didn't have our check ready! Another 5 minutes go by and the waitress is no where to be seen. At this point we are extremely frustrated and demand to see a manager. After speaking with the manager, she brings us the check and does not even apologize. 

All in all the experience took over an hour and we only saw our server twice. Once to take our order and another after we requested our check through the host. Will never visit this place again.",5,0,0

Food:
Tiramisu shake was rich and yummy.  
Oreo shake was good too, but it didn't really have enough alcohol.  People at the table agreed that it was a waste to pay extra for an alcoholic shake.

I went with the the steakhouse burger, which was a Beef Patty Crusted With Black Pepper, Holsteins Creamy Steak Sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, Wild Mushrooms, Swiss Cheese, for $17.50.  The burger arrived, and biting into it, it was cooked medium rare, and just beyond juicy.  As wonderful and flavourful the patty was, i felt that the toppings got muddled together.  I wish that they omitted one or two components, that way the selected ingredients could be shown off, instead of hidden in the background.

The ambiance surely is nice, as you would expect in one of the new city center hotels.  The waiters are friendly and accommodating.  The burgers were delish, though I wouldn't say they were anything beyond what you would expect from a $20 burger kind of place.

The thing that makes me want to come back are the shakes.  As people have said before, the variety of innovative flavors they have here is phenomenal but can be daunting.  Get everyone in your group to get a different one so you can try out lots of flavors!  I had a s'mores one that was incredible!  Not to mention the presentation of the shakes is a pleasure to the eyes and tastebuds.  The marshmallow garnish I think was a homemade marshmallow and was delicious.

First Impression....Ambiance, music, decor were all spectacularly modern. Place seemed like the spot to be for a Friday night bite. We were seated immediately (arrived at 7ish). The beer list is top notch and that is a huge deal for me when I am getting the evening started. Took us a while to all decide on what we should eat. Seemed like the server got a bit frustrated with our inability to make decisions.

I went with the GOLD STANDARD, based on the servers recommendation. I have never had a dry aged burger, but boy am I craving one now holy smokes. Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli....I usually like to dry dog my meat....not one for lubrication as far as condiments and such go. But they did a fantastic job focusing on not slopping up such a delightful cut... er uh grind of beef. Pretty close to the best burger I have ever sunk my teeth into. Didnt even get around to polishing off the sweet potato fries....first ones I have ever had that were actually crispy...I understand how dificult it is to crispify a sweet potato fry.

Server really pushed the spiked shakes...but I was so full....he said ""Dude I can put it in a to-go cup for you""....I caved into the Raspberry Cheesecake Shake it was damn good....even after a night in the freezer...Vodka shake is good for breakfast boys and girls.

The burger came with a side of fries. The burger was large and the medium beef patty was perfect. It was a great burger overall, however it wasn't the best Japanese infused burger I've had. So I cannot agree that this is the best burger in Vegas. Maybe top 3.

The service was excellent. The server made a mistake on the order, when I notified her, she promptly corrected the receipt with a smile.",5,5,5

I would recommend the milkshakes. They have a special set of milkshakes on the menu that come with alcohol for about $13. If you choose to not include any alcohol in your shake, it will cost you a mere $9 like the other standard non-alcoholic shakes.

For the burger, I ordered the billionaire burger with foie gras and added lobster. Of course I would order the most expensive burger and make it even more expensive by adding lobster LOL. Regardless of the price, the burger was very flavorful and the foie gras made the burger juicier than it already was. The burgers are a nice size as well so prepare to be stuffed.

We tried the ahi sliders and fried pickles. The pickles come as spears. All of this proved to be too much food and I wish I would have known about the to-go cups for the milkshakes.

I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the food.  Thankfully, some good craft beer made up for this.  

We started with a bucket of popcorn, which seems to be a gastropub sort of trend these days in Vegas.  Popcorn is popcorn, and by that measure I guess it was good.  I ordered the bulgolgi burger ($16.50).  I expected an interesting flavored ala Bachi burger.  What I got was a mediocre burger, unfortunately. Although I ordered it medium rare, it came medium well.  The patty was dry, and the buns seemed a little hard as well.  I ordered the steak fries, which were drenched in saltiness.  I was thankful for this though because I tasted a skinny fry, and it was crunchy and over fried.  

While Holstein's burgers were a let down for the price, the beer selection for me was redeeming. While not the best beer offering in Vegas (or The Strip for that matter), they did have Lagunitas IPA and Firestone Walker Pale Ale on draft.  The bottle selection was pretty decent.

Pretty impressed considering this is a Millennial restaurant. My friend and I arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. The restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. Our waiter have us some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was ""addicting."" We caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! Way too much for me. Our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. When we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. We took his digestion and decided to split a Rising Sun burger with sweet potato fries and a lobster roll with regular fries. We also ordered the Philly egg rolls. In case you hadn't heard, Holsteins is known for their milkshakes. I ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. Both were amazing. The Philly egg rolls were delicious. The burger was tasty. Tempura avocado won me over. The only disappointment was the lobster roll. It was just ok. Not worth the price or the calories.

crispy pork belly bun and that shit sooo good, unless you don't like fat, cus i bit into a fatty ass piece and just about died

I enjoyed the Candy Cane boozy shake which was very yummy and almost a meal in itself...but the winner was the burger. I had the Gold Standard burger and it definitely lived up to its name. Perfectly cooked to medium; bacon had a good bite to it, not too much lettuce and tomato so that it complimented instead of overwhelmed the burger. The aioli was super yum too. The seasoning on the burger enhanced the meat but the star was the meat itself. The burger was tender, juicy, and was as it should be if you were making it on your own grill at home. I had the shoestring fries which were clearly hand cut and cooked to order. They were crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.
My husband had the Nom-Nom burger. He initially took the chips off the burger but put them back on when he saw how much they complimented his burger and added the perfect crunch. He orders his burgers well done and the waitress didn't even flinch as some often do. It was done perfectly...and still had that juiciness that a good burger should have without the redness.

There are burgers, and then there are BURGERS.  Holsteins serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. and overall I had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.

LOCATION:  Second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

On my recent trip, I visited Holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  We decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  Thank goodness for being early.  In this case, the early diner gets the burger.

FOOD:  There were three of us and collectively we ordered the Gold standard burger, the California turkey, and the Big Fat Greek.  All burgers\/sandwiches were served with fries.  I was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, I decided on their award winning Gold Standard Burger.  

The Gold Standard Burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  This has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  This dry aged beef sirloin (smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  I thought all the condiments served complemented the burger well.  My taste buds were quite happy indeed.  The fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  The burger was the true shining (gold) star at lunch.

As for my two friends, I believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    Overall, we all enjoyed our meal\/food.

SERVICE:  The hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  The server was a friendly and polite young woman.  She greeted us and took our drink orders.  She also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  As previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the Gold Standard Burger, and I thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  She  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  

BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and great company.  I strongly recommend the Gold Standard Burger.",12,11,13

Typically, when I go to Vegas, I like to have at least one meal that isn't quite as formal (and we typically pick something fun like Burger Bar, BLT Burger, Pink Taco, etc).  This time we decided to try Holsteins mostly because the Cosmopolitan is such a nice hotel.  Unfortunately Holsteins wasn't up to par with the service level in the rest of the hotel.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food and they got the order wrong.  They corrected the food part but never gave us our drinks.  About halfway through our meal, the waitress informed us that they weren't making the drink my wife ordered that night (very strange) and they still hadn't got my strawberry milkshake.  We finished our meal and one of the managers came by to clear our plates.  He asked how our meal was and I informed him that I still hadn't gotten my strawberry shake (had mentioned it to the waitress when she was by earlier).  It finally arrived about 15 minutes later (in fairness, the manager did apologize and took the shake off our bill).  We noticed 2 other tables complaining also about the time it was taking to get their food.  All throughout this process they typically had 6 people on the floor (2 cocktail servers in bright red dresses who the bus boys were just hanging around and flirting with, a couple of hostesses...one that was just standing in the middle of the floor and doing nothing, and a couple of managers that weren't doing much of anything).  Although they couldn't just go to the back and flip burgers, my thought process throughout was that they should have had less front end people and more in the kitchen.  If this is typical of this restaurant, we will just frequent the other burger restaurants the next time we're in town Honestly, they're a dime a dozen in Vegas and the service at the other places I mentioned is far superior to Holsteins.",0,0,0

Our friends had recommended Holsteins, and as fans of Burger Bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  Spicy and delicious!  Our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu

This place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  We wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the ""Sausage and Peppers"" Potsickers and the Mexican Car Bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  The potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... O.M.G.  Sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  These things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  But we absolutely loved them.

For our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (I know I know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  I had the Surf and Turf Quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, Manchego Cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  Very yummy.  For our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the El Machete, described on the menu as ""Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli"".  The beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  The burger overall wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  Either way, it was good good beef.

We finished with a ""grown up"" milkshake... the Campfire S'mores, which I only had a few sips of because I was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  They will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  Overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at Holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in Las Vegas.  Oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  We will definitely be back!",0,0,0

The milkshakes themselves were fantastic. I, personally, had the Almond Joy (with coconut rum)...SO SO GOOD!! Food was good, but nothing to rush out and try.

My only, and biggest, complaint was the volume. It was busy, but we literally had to yell to the person next to us just to have a regular conversation. This is one of my big pet peeves in a restaurant, and it would make me not want to return. I know it isn't the restaurants fault, really, but it makes me crazy.

I would say check them out if you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan (or if it is National Milkshake Day).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shakes are fabulous. They are delicious, huge, and beautiful. A feast for the eyes just as much as for your taste buds. They are over the top and impressive if you have guests from out of town. They really do belong in Vegas.

My problem with this place is the food is just average, and of course, you pay Strip prices for it.

On my last trip here, we had 2 shakes (The S'mores & Grasshopper) & 2 orders of fries and I paid $60 with the tip. I feel like that's a little ridiculous.",0,0,0

I had the tenderloin rossini which comes with foie gras. I wasn't that hungry, so 2 tiny buns sounded great and I couldn't resist the foie gras. It comes with some chips on the side, but I also got a side of sweet potato fries so left the chips. The fries were okay, a little too fried. My friend got the rising sun burger and said it was the best burger he'd ever had in his life, no joke! Our waitress had also told us that at least once a day, someone orders that one and says the same thing. The skinny fries that came with were indeed skinny, so very crunchy and tasty. I liked them more than the sweet potato fries, which is something I never say! My other friend was even less hungry than I was, so he got the tacos & tequila appetizer, and wasn't that impressed, unfortunately. I guess you can't go to a burgers & shakes place and expect super good seafood :\ Oh, we also got the frozen grasshopper shake to share and it was delicious -- tiny, crunchy chocolate balls in every sip, and though there was alcohol in it, you couldn't taste it at all and didn't feel any effects from it either. You can also order all the shakes without alcohol. Overall, great service and great food, but stick with the burgers!",0,0,0

There are plenty of toppings available for your burger, and they include cheeses, and all sorts of things. If you can think of it, it's probably available to put on your burger. However, I was so disappointed that my mom's food was not to her liking that it made me not even want mine. She opted to order the lobster roll as her salad tasted pretty rancid (you could argue that who goes to a place with Buns in the name and orders a salad, but hey....if you just bought me a pair of Louboutins for Christmas, you can order whatever the hell you want!)...and it served as our late night snack. 

Lobster Mac and Cheese was passable...not enough lobster, weird kind of noodles and extremely salty.

The burger patty was cooked medium, and all the fix-ins complimented the burger well...but I can't get over the fact that the bun was so terrible.   The burger bun was dry, cold, and slightly stale...it was so terrible that I could not enjoy my burger.  I almost had to eat the burger patty by itself and toss the bun.   Everyone else in my group agreed, the burger bun was stale and dry.  If it wasn't for the dry bun, I might be able to give it 4-stars, but I just could not enjoy my burger on a stale dry bun!

Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers\/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!

The decor is so cute here w\/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w\/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w\/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt\/sweet popcorn. My bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies

Bamboozled Shakes:
Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description\/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes. 

Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso\/coffee flavor. 

Banana Creme Pie - My bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w\/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w\/ white chocolate covered bananas.

The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w\/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!

Apps:
Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w\/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!

Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing

Crispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari rings

Maine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. 

Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on

Burgers:
Rising Sun w\/ onion rings(normally comes w\/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divine

Fun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w\/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over Rising sun because he prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w\/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w\/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(

Gold Standard w\/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!

I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w\/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!

Note: Try and get a girl server. The first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. The 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed",14,10,12

I don't know if it was the alcohol, but this burger was one of the best I've ever had. All the flavors just meshed so well. The delicious dry aged beef sirloin was so savory and perfectly medium rare. The fries were fantastic as well.

We went there around 3-4ish during a football game so it was relatively busy. We had to wait a short time and were immediately seated. The first thing is that we were sitting there for about 15-20 minutes of absolutely no service. I flagged down one waitress to address the issue which she said she would resolve. Another 10 minutes pass and I had to flag down another bus boy which he actually went to our waiter and had him take our order. I understand that the restaurant was busy but 30 minutes without any attention to a table is quite absurd, especially for Vegas status!

When the waiter finally arrived, we ordered the Smoking Passion float and a Artichoke Guac to start. Holsteins is known to have their spiked shakes and we had to try one. The smoking passion float came with 2 mango meringues that were made in front of us with liquid nitrogen hence the name ""Smoking"" Passion float. The shake itself was so sweet that the taste of any alcohol was absent from our taste buds. The Artichoke Guac was a meaty starter with some nice spiced pita chips. It was a great way to start off our meal with some sweetness from the shake and some savoriness from the dip.

For our entree, the GF and I split a nomnom burger with a side of steak fries. The nomnom burger was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the steak fries were great. Although the steak fries did remind of a better quality version of potato wedges from KFC. 

Overall my eating experience was great, the initial waiting experience did turn me off about this place and my friend assured me that this was the first time that this kind of service happened. I'm sure I will come here again but I'm hoping that this waiting game doesn't having again.",1,1,1

Enter the Gold Standard which I'm still digesting. Thank you for helping me cross that off the list, Gold Standard Burger! The arugula and the goat cheese made this burger over and over, though you would have caught me dipping it in ketchup bc it did get a bit dry without any traditional condiments.

I was supposed to wake up and go to Bouchon in the morning to get a fancy breakfast, but somehow that didn't happen.  I even told my friends I would meet them there.  Sleep prevailed for a few more hours.  When my friends got back from their breakfast, I was hungry for lunch.  As we ventured to explore the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins immediately caught my eye... well the pink cow in front sure did.  The modern feel and fun music drew us in. 

The menu has a bunch of fun items to choose from.  Their list of burgers is amazing.  Delicious meaty burgers.  They also had a great selection of alcoholic shakes (Bam-Boozled Shakes) and some cute flavored shots.  They also have plenty of beer and wine.  The ultimate burger spot I'd say.

I decided to get the Rising Sun.  It was a Kobe beef burger with Teriyaki glaze, furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  This was recommended from the waitress as her favorite burger.  It was honestly quite salty but it was really good.  The best part was the tempura avocado.  We also tried the Korean Bull-gogi.  That came with an over easy egg, kim chee, and kalbi glaze.  This burger was not as salty and also very good.  The Kobe beef of the Rising Sun made that burger super moist though.

To drink we shared the Oreo shake, which had Bailey's Irish Cream in it.  Make sure that you finish it cold because a luke-warm alcoholic shake is not so good.  The Bailey's was really good and just barely noticeable, except when I felt my the heat in my face.  It is kinda pricey for a shake though $11.

I ended up splitting this with my buddy and also sharing the ""gols standard"" with the dry aged beef and goat cheese.

I msut say, they were both delicious but very very different:
Billionaire:  The patty itself was made from Kobe and foie gras, then it was topped of with a seared slab of foie.  Taking a bite into it is sensory richness overload, effin delicious!  I immediately grabbed the Stella and washed it down and it was just heaven.  But pretty much, all yo get form this burger is the richness of fat.  I am glad I split it because I would not feel good after eating this one alone.  Great burger, would be willing to split it again with someone.
Gold Standard:  Now this is a burgerthat I thought had great balance and flavor.  The patty was delicious, definitely a great pronounced beef flavor.  The goat cheese and tomato confit was absolutely perfect in the burger.  This is a burger I would order again and eat on my own.

Their fries, onion rings and wings are nothing to rave about.  They have a great beer selection, and the service we got was spot on excellent.

The space and menu are creative and stylish.  Holstein's is a restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes. 

There's pretty much something for everyone including bar food and different variations of your popular burgers.  Come prepared to pay strip prices though.  Burger and fries will set you back $15 - $20 with no alcohol not included. 

I've been here a few times and have had the following:
-  Caesar Salad:  Delicious
-  Bucket of Buffalo Wings:  Best I've ever had
-  California Turkey:  The patty was good and juicy; however, bland in flavors with a greasy bun.
-  The Gold Standard:  Again, the patty was cooked very well and was juicy.  The overall burger was way to greasy.
-  Key Lime Pie Shake:  Delicious
-  Creamsicle Float:  Not a fan
-  Oreo Shake:  Not enough Oreo's!
-  Fries:  Good, not great.

So far, the food has been hit and miss for me.  The service isn't anything to write about either.  Especially at the bar... in fact, don't expect good service there.

The hostess said there were no tables available and the only one she could move us to was a table that was behind the group of guys  ....(Really?!?!). We said never mind and sat at the same table.  A few minutes went by and I couldn't stand it anymore. When John checked on us, I told him that I was not happy about sitting at this table because the guys next to us were so loud that my friend and I can't even enjoy each others company AND it was ruining our dining experience. I also told John that we asked the hostess if we can sit somewhere else and she said the tables were taken. I politely pointed out that there was obviously several open tables available.  With no hesitation John rescued us and moved us to another table.  My friend and I could now actually hear each other and feel comfortable eating our food.  Sam was also great who was our waiter, he checked on us often to see if we needed anything.

It wasn't enough that I had the best burger of my life here, it had to change my whole thought process on burgers. I mean how gourmet can you make a burger? You can only do so much to elevate a burger, what can you possibly do? 

Well let me introduce you to the ""Rising Sun""
-Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furiki, crispy yam, and a tempura avocado and don't forgot the egg, its part of of every perfect burger. 
The Kobe beef has so much flavor. The beef is delicious and sweet, but not overpowering. 
I loved the touch with tempura avocado because I've never seen nor heard of it, but its good! 
The crispy yam makes a play with the avocado to give your burger the crispy texture along with the nori.
Then the egg to top it off to make a monster burger even more messy.
All these components together create a sweet and savory party in your mouth.
How can I enjoy a burger so much and not cry that bacon isn't apart of it? 
I'm beyond impressed at this point. The day before I was at Ramsays Burger thinking I had a good burger. There is no competition for this burger heaven, hands down. 

Everyone one knows the perfect combo with a burger and fry is a shake!
And we're in vegas so why not some alcohol!?
Can I get a ""RED VELVET CAKE SHAKE""?
This shake is on point and a great way to cool off and get Turnt!(Drunk) and ready for Marquee!
Vodka is hard to pair with desserts, if its too strong it just destroys. 
Well It isn't strong but you'll know it was there later. The shake finishes off nicely with a mini whoopie pie on top.

It does sit in a convenient location, since it's across from Marquee's entrance.

I guess it might just be that I've had more than enough of my share of burgers the past week, but the classic burger didn't have any real stand out flavor to it.  The steak fries were okay, but not much different from something  you'd get from Red Robin. 

The only thing that got me interested in the place was their selection of beers. I actually spent more time deciding on what beer I wanted to drink the on what I wanted to eat, probably if I spent more time on deciding what to eat I might've enjoyed it more.  Anyway I ordered the Red Fox Stout, and it had someone of a similar taste to Guiness but with interesting flavors of what seemed similar to wine.

From the other reviews, it's seems like the place has better things to offer, so it's possible that I'd give this place a shot again. But there are other great restaurants in the area, so I wouldn't force myself to eat here if I couldn't decide on anything to eat.",1,0,1

Nothing really to rant and rave about in my opinion.  A couple of people that are local to Vegas that know my friend took us here for dinner.  It was one of the cheaper places that was close enough so we could bounce right over to Marquee afterwards.  I just had the truffle lobster mac and cheese - good, satisfying but, I've had better, bigger and cheaper. Muahaha, haven't we all? Anyways I know it's Vegas (I've always hated that excuse as being o-kay to rape people of their money..) and all but $15 for a large spatula scoop of mac and cheese? Pa-leze. They did have a pretty interesting drink menu.  Again, on recommendation of these local folks I tried their dragon fruit vitamin cocktail - really good.

Other than that.... I would have rather throw down an extra $50 for a better meal, and atmosphere.  I felt like I was in a Fuddruckers turned club.  Eh there's always tomorrow!

Because it was late, they had turned the music up significantly and had a DJ spinning the beats, and let's say it was loud. Not that you're walking in not knowing that but by this time our choices were limited. After only a few moments, our waiter Sam greeted us, and we explained the music level was loud enough we were not even sure we'd be staying. Sam offered an inviting and also understanding smile and offered to check in with us again in a few more minutes.

I think if I rate the restaurant on my standard scale of taste, ambience and a memorable experience, I'd say that the milkshakes are certainly memorable. Specifically their tiramisu shake with a shot of petron. Quite delicious and presentation is excellent. This is a restaurant that understands that they need to stand out and not just do the same boring shakes. Really impressed really overall with their attempts to be creative. The burgers are also inventive and creative. 

The ambience works for what they are trying to achieve, which is a more casual bar-type setting with TVs and comfortable places to sit. Designed really more like a late night place after a night of drinking and clubbing (or maybe before). So on that note I'm fine with the ambience. It works for this type of place. 

I think my only major disappointment (not a complaint really) is that the burgers just aren't that special. They look special and the sound special but when you actually eat them, they are just ""meh"". Not earth shattering. Maybe I'm of the mindset that the best burgers focus on the meat and the preparation and then are minimal beyond that. Sometimes when you put too much on a sandwich (even high end ingredients), it can actually lessen the burger.

I came with a my Vegas local friend to grab a bite before watching our show Zarkana and decided to eat here since it wasn't too far from the Aria. Like all the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan are trendy just like the hotel, the music was loud and the decor around the restaurant was fun to look at especially the Holstein's Bull right across from the bar. 

I ordered the Captain Hook that had raw and grilled salmon all on one burger and I thought was very unique and my friend ordered the Rising Sun Burger that included Kobe beef and tempura avocado. We both shared each others burgers to get a taste and we loved it but it was pricey just like everything  else inside the Cosmopolitan but who cares if you just want to relax with friends and family and have a great time. Our meals included strong fries and for the appetizer we got the lobster quesadilla and complimentary popcorn.

Burgers were alright though my Hen House did come with a fried over easy egg that was cooked through.

Being a HUGE fan of burgers, I've been to many burger joints and restaurants, and have been searching for the perfect burger. Holsteins was pretty damn good, but not the top of the top. 

I ordered the campfire s'mores shake, which is the most amazing shake I have ever had. The alcohol in the shake was very subtle, and the shake was just.. perfect. no other words.

The lobster mac and cheese- pieces of lobster with mac and cheese and truffle oil. As a big fan of truffle oil, this dish was perfect for me. So far, so good.

Then the burgers- the gold standard and the billionaire.
I hate blue cheese, so had only regular cheddar cheese with the gold standard. It was a good burger, the ingredients were paired well and I was satisfied.
The billionaire burger- wgayu and foie gras- was ok. Because foie gras was banned in California, it was a must that we got that burger. However, the burger was a bit dry, and did not meet up to par.

Our meal before flying home consisted of:
-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating.
-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy! 
-- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right.

The spicy aioli and fire roasted chilis added the extra kick that I love, and the pepperjack cheese was melting perfectly onto the nicely toasted bun.

They are pretty creative with the burgers, I'll give them that. The burger patties themselves aren't that flavorful, but it's all the different toppings and condiments on each burger that make each burger tasty.

I've eaten here twice with friends and these are the burgers we've tried that have been consistently good:

The Billionaire - foie gras! Not a huge piece of it, but you can certainly taste that it's there.
The Rising Sun - essentially a teriyaki burger, but it's got a good rich but sweet taste to it.
The Golden Standard - can't pinpoint any one thing inside this burger that made it taste really good, but the moment you take a bite of the whole thing it comes together wonderfully!
The Nom Nom - texture with potato chips inside and tasty special mayo sauce!

MILK SHAKES (alcoholic ones!):

Red Velvet - my fav, really delicious can't taste the alcohol at all. Little cookie bits inside for texture.
Tiramisu - strong but tasty. Lots of cookie and chocolate toppings, chocolate syrup and cookie bits inside!
Mint chocolate chip - only alright. Didn't mask the alcohol that well, tastes pretty simple, like melted mint ice cream with cookie bits inside.

AND OMG GET THE LOBSTER MAC 'N CHEESE. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. But it is so damn small for how much you pay for it ($18). It comes out in a small...I'd say 5""x4"" cast iron tray. If it weren't for the price, I would just eat three orders of the lobster mac and cheese for the entire meal.

Service was only O-K. The waitresses usually seem distracted because the place is so busy, and the food didn't come out very fast. They refused to seat 10 of us at a table and split us up 7 and 3 and told 3 of us to sit at the bar, but there were no seats available at the bar because it was a dinner rush... so we just pulled up three chairs at the table and everyone fit just fine.",2,2,2

Perfect size, filled me up and tasted light and fresh. 

Must try: the Cereal Bowl - you can't go wrong with cap n' crunch & vodka - it was like childhood memories mixed with an amazing giddy buzz

The billionaire burger was definitely the better of the two... which I expected since its almost a whopping $10 more. The foie gras and truffle aioli is what made it good though but for $27... I could just get 2 truffle burgers from Umami and be full as hell and be twice as truffled-out.

Gold standard was underwhelming. First, it was cooked well--no pink in the center whatsoever... when I ordered medium rare. Meat itself wasn't that flavorful for being dry aged sirloin.... bacon was pretty lame, and the ""goat cheddar"" was kind of lackluster. Tomato confit and garlic aioli must have been pretty skimpy since my burger was overall pretty dry.

Otherwise, service was alright and decor is cute and finding a table was a breeze during mid-saturday lunch. 

So while the billionaire burger was good and the gold standard wasn't BAD, they still are pumped with vegas hype so I can't justify spending that much on a burger that I could top for even less $$ somewhere closer to home. For the price of the gold standard, I could basically get 3 sammies at Earl of Sandwich.. which sounds a lot tastier as well.

Although close, I still vote for BurGR simply because Holsteins is a good $5 more expensive per burger with comparable quality in my opinion. My friend begs to differ but this is my review.

Drinks here are overpriced and very average, so I wouldn't recommend spending your money on them.

Burgers range from like $18-20 on average, and it's a very average sized patty, maybe 1\/3lb. They are cooked well though, as you would expect. 

As everyone says, I tried the Gold Standard burger with an egg and I finished that in like 2 minutes.

One thing for this place is that the place is pretty big and the we didn't have to wait very long, compared to a 30-45min wait at BurGR. Either way, I'd suggest coming here to try it if you haven't, since it's a decent place.

Taylor added grilled onions to his ""Nom Nom Burger"" and he acted like he was satisfied. Andrew killed his obviously. Willy was a little under the weather due to the alcohol he consumed the night before but nonetheless he said his was also awesome.

These type of restaurants are usually my favorite.  I love great burgers, and anything spun off in the form of an upscale burger joint.

The appetizer, which was chicken queso with chips that was pretty nice.

The burger I ordered was perfectly cooked and the beef was great, but the bun was a really weird consistency, not crispy\/toasted, and not soft.  It was kinda like a soft bagel.  Too tough for a burger with a lot of toppings, and everything wanted to slide out of the burger.  

The lettuce on the burger was like butter lettuce or something really soft and not crisp, and had a bitterness not adding to the burger.

Also the steak fries are a misnomer, they are actually wedges, there is a big difference.

Not a remarkable restaurant of this type, I would much rather go to le burger brasserie in the paris, BLT burgers in the mirage, or the burger bar in the mandalay shops.

The ambience was nothing special either.

Go to the hidden\/secret pizza place upstairs from this for a better meal in a cooler place.",0,0,0

1. Total a-hole a the next table--can't be helped.

First off, I've been comin' to the Cosmopolitan since it opened. Love the place! 

Grabbed a drink at the bar, Marcell (I think that's his name) made me the best Woodford Reserve Old Fashion since I don't know when! 

Then we got seated by Maria in a great booth, with really cool paintings.

Our server Sam came up and greeted us and told all the cool things we should try. I had the Rising Sun, likely due to me being asian, so it was kind of a default choice. Haha, amazing burger though! My date had a Thai salad, she's asian and on a diet. So it was very fitting. She said it was great! 

Food was promptly delivered by what looked to be conjoined twins. Mardan & Edwin (not sure if that's their names) but they were nice and made sure we had all the things we needed to enjoy our meal. 

Sam checked on us quickly and made sure our food was good. It was! 

When it came time to get a desert a lady named Jade told us about this thing that looked like a burger, but was really ice cream. Good times! 
The conjoined twins came and delivered our food again. Such good times around here. 

Bussers on point, one even asked me how I kept so fit while eating burgers and deserts. Had a sweet mustache.

Holstein's charges $3.00 to sub out the fries for a salad.  This was a very small salad in a small cereal bowl.  Really?  That's ridiculous!  Also the salad consisted of mostly arugula, a few very thin slices of cucumber and maybe two cherry tomatoes.

The burgers were ridiculously large and kinda dry, so our beagle was burdened the task of eating those. I ordered the Big Fat Greek (obv a Greek ingredient inspired burger) and the lamb burger was massive and juicy yet overwhelmingly onion-y. My mom split the Steakhouse Burger with my grandma, and she said it was pretty decent. My sister got some random burger. Buns were lame and plain. 
Ordered onion rings on the side for an extra $2.50-- super dry and mostly breading. 
The shakes were good, but not $9-$13 good. 
We also tried the lobster\/truffle mac n cheese, which was one of the more delicious parts of the meal. 
For 3 burgers, an appetizer, 2 milkshakes, and a coke, we paid approx. $120. Just no. The food was decent, and the shakes were really delicious, but it is kinda way too expensive in my opinion. 
Our waitress was really sweet, and the place had wonderful decor and mood. Just wish the food kept up with all of that.",1,1,0

I went here because they make a delicious Bloody Mary. Nothing fancy but it tastes spicy and made the way I like it. They have two kinds of bloody Mary's and one I believe has bacon. I get the regular one. 

First visit, I had the classic hamburger which was good but I wouldn't say it was ""amazing!""  But it was just a typical burger. (Im glad I went back to see my friends burgers) 

I sat at the bar first night and service was fine. Again, nothing spectacular and they were semi-busy meaning that the bar wasn't packed but there were people there and in the restaurant. 

The next day my friends went back with me and we got a table. The waitress we had that day which was July 6th was sweet and helpful. I had the chicken sandwich this time and it was delicious. It had two good size pieces of chicken. (Yummy, more chicken then bread) They were indecisive on their burgers and she said ""you can get a classic burger anywhere"". I was like ""darn, that's true! Go with a good one"". They both ordered Gold Standards and they said it was delicious. One said its been awhile since she had a burger that good. I was thinking next time I'll have to try it. 

We went back before we left to get a Bloody Mary for me and shakes which have liquor for them.  They looked very fulfilling. We asked for everything to go since we were leaving. I'm not much on milk shakes but they said they tasted great. They finished them before we got in taxi. 

I def need to go back to try another one of their burgers out. ;)",3,0,4

I checked in at the hostess stand and was offered a bar seat or table. I'm not huge on dinning at the bar so I asked for a table. I was given a pager and told would be about 5-10 minutes. No problem, I'll go check out their gift shop. 5 minutes later the pager went off and I was seated in a near empty restaurant. next to a romantic couple. Nice! They couldn't have sat me next to ummm well let's see? Nobody else.

Chaz was my server. The restaurant has a DJ spinning in the front and the music blasts through the restaurant. He was mixing christmas songs with popular songs. Very interesting. I was sitting low and back to the music. and Chaz was standing tall. I could not hear him. Chaz was adequate though. Brought me an ice water while I looked over the menu.

Chaz showed me the extensive beer list but I did not want a beer tonight. Good selection though. They have about a dozen adult milkshakes on the menu. I chose the grasshopper made with vanilla ice cream, mint and chocolate vodka. It was just ok. They give you the excess shake in the metal mixer. The food menu is extensive for a burger place. A few salads, some mini burgers, and some starters. The stars are the burgers, done with different ingredients and combinations. 

I wanted to try so many of the appetizers. But dining solo I only chose one. The chicken and waffles. It was lame. One tiny little waffle. It was dry. And 3 chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were good. Hot and crispy. Some ranch dressing and some maple syrup on the side. I'll try something different next time for sure.

For my burger, I tried the Longhorn. It came out medium like the way I asked. Toppings on it were cole slaw, beef brisket, and BBQ sauce. Very tasty but messy. I ate it with a knife and fork. I Beef in the burger was lean and flavorful. The bun was getting stale. It comes with shoestring or steak fries and for $2 extra you can get duck fat fries. These were possibly the biggest let down. Mine were cold and dry. The flavor on them was ok but I was expecting them to be tastier and more seasoned. I think I will just go with the steak fries next time.

Holsteins is not In-N-Out burger. Expect to spend a few extra dollars here. A $10 shake and app and a $15(+$2) burger, It is not cheap. The quality of the food is very good and I can only see this place getting better over the next few weeks.",1,0,1

That is how Holsteins shakes made me feel, and their grown up version added a tinge of a twist to remind me that I am not 5 anymore, and I am okay with that.

Holsteins is known for their milkshakes so I was curious to know if they met up to that prominent expectation. We sat at the bar and were greeted instantly; it was nice that the bartender gave us his full attention even though we were only looking for a taste of a milkshake. I'm not an ice cream or milkshake devotee, but I was taken away by the intriguing menu of unusual paired milkshakes, such as the Frozen Grasshopper (Peppermint, Chocolate, Crème De Menthe, Pinnacle Chocolate Vodka), Cereal Bowl (3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch), Red Velvet Cake Shake (Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie), and even an all year around Pumpkin Pie (Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, Pepitas Brittle) shake! Although I was hesitant at first at the idea of an alcohol infused milkshake, they prepare virgin ones as well. I stay far away from hard liquor unless the social gathering is right, and this night was one of them. The bartender assured me that I would hardly taste the alcohol anyway, is this a good sign? 

C E R E A L  B O W L  [ $ 13 ]
We decided on the Cereal Bowl; 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch in a vanilla ice cream base, yum! This milky concoction masked the alcohol so well that I didn't taste anything but the abundance of one of my childhood favourite cereals, Cap'N Crunch! So light yet sweet with a just-right cereal texture, this treat was more than the best milkshake I've ever tasted.

I certainly see myself visiting Holsteins again, perhaps to try the Red Velvet Cake Shake or the Moscow Moo; it's difficult to say no when these milkshakes are completely inspired by cake ingredients to childhood inspired creations x",16,16,16

All I knew was that I REALLY wanted a burger so I couldn't think of better place to go than a place that specializes in burgers. The best part about this being a whim is that I went in having no expectations beforehand which is always great when experiencing something for the first time. 

At first impressions, the restaurant is nothing particularly special. In fact, I found the images of the animals labeled by their ""food parts"" a bit disturbing. The service was average. Nothing to write home about. 

I ordered the fries and burger, nothing outrageous. As I mentioned previously, I just wanted a burger. 

They started off by giving out a little bucket of popcorn. I LOVED that popcorn and I'm not a popcorn eater. It had an odd taste to it, but odd in a good way. Also, it was BUTTERY and I love popcorn that has a lot of butter. That's the problem with popcorn now-a-days...they don't put enough butter on it. 

Shortly after that, the burger and fries came out. Someone else mentioned how the fries taste like the fries one can buy in a bag at the supermarket and that is true. However, they taste like the good, expensive bag of fries that one can buy at the supermarket so I wasn't complaining. The burger was not bad. It was just okay. I've had better burgers.

Something cool though: apparently, the guy who played the brother on Seinfeld was sitting at the table next to mine.  It wasn't a big deal to me since I don't watch the show, but my mother, who I was with at the time, was starstruck.",1,1,0

Unfortunately, after living in the city for a few years and trying a lot of wonderful food that this city has to offer, we returned for a visit and I was less than impressed. 

Previously their burgers came sans fries and there were a few different fries that were offered. We tried truffle fries (I think...) and I was excited to try them again when we returned last night! Unfortunately now the fries come on the side of your burger, and they don't offer anything other than regular, sweet potato and onion rings (which are just some lamely pedestrian offerings for a burger place on the strip). I tried the regular fries with my burger and was pretty unimpressed. In my opinion, if you are serving 15$ burgers you better be offering some pretty amazing fries to go with them. Sadly, this was not the case.

I tried the Nom Nom burger and it was really good. The meat was actually cooked the medium rare that I asked for, which I always appreciate. The cheddar was good, the 1000 island was a nice flavor, and the chips were fantastic. I would have much rather preferred a side of the chips (which tasted like they may have been made in house?) rather than the fries that I got with my burger! The burger was huge, while the portion of fries wasn't insane, the size of the burger was! I couldn't even finish half of the burger. 

If you check in and order a burger they give you a free 12 oz of their house lager, which wasn't spectacular, but it's always nice to get something free for a yelp check in! It looked like they had a few rotating taps with craft brews, and they had a nice selection of bottled beer to offer! I really liked looking at their hard cider offerings, they even had a few that I hadn't tried before!

The service was very good, and it was incredibly fast. It was almost too fast, we probably could have sat and chatted a bit more. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, though.

So what is Holsteins? Holsteins is a casual, semi-gourmet burger joint with great late night hours, incredible appetizers, and cocktails and drunken shakes that meet and exceed exactly what they are out to accomplish. And as far as price? Extremely friendly for what you get and the fact that it is in Las Vegas in one of the pricier Hotel and Casinos.

I ended up going in twice on our trip - and both times I had the Gold Standard burger. Sharp cheddar goat cheese? To die for. The burger was so rich and flavorful I couldn't finish it either time.

The shakes? Leave room for one because these are some of the best and most creative shakes out there - and you better get the extra shot. This is Vegas after all.

A couple of suggestions: get the onion rings. The fries are decent but nothing special. However, the hand battered onion rings are in the upper echelon of onion rings I have tried in my lifetime (with the rings at Hodad's in San Diego the undisputed #1). 

Lastly, everyone seems to talk about the buffalo dip, but don't shy away from the cheese steak eggrolls - because they are otherworldly. Make sure you set aside time and room in your stomach to go through appetizer, a burger and a shake, because you don't want to miss out on any of it.",3,0,4

We had a couple of drinks at The Chandelier Bar directly across the way.  It was our wedding anniversary and we were out with a couple of friends.  We decided to go with Holsteins instead of China Poblano based on Yelp reviews.  As we left the bar the music in the area went from background dance music for the night club on the other side of the room, to deafening.  We were greeted by the hostess who offered to seat us once we finished our drinks from the other bar.  That didn't sit so well with members of our group.  We walked around and debated skipping and going across the road to any of the dozens of places to eat, but my lazy kicked in and we decided to give it ago.

Back to Holsteins, sans our cocktails, greeted by the same hostess.  I mentioned it was a bummer of a policy, to which she stated don't shoot the messenger.  Again, almost sent my friends into a tailspin, but we trudged on!

Once seated, the music got louder. So loud we had to literally yell across the table to each other.  At this point we were all ready to leave, until Sam greeted us.  He was so genuine and polite, I felt bad for him having to work right then!    We expressed the fact we were deciding to stay or go.  He completely understood and even offered to mention it to his manager, knowing full well nothing could be done.

We stuck it out.... The food was average.  We got 4 different full sized burgers and fries; classic, gold standard, el caliente, and the rising sun (mine).

I got the $15 Longhorn burger (medium-well patty, smoked beef brisket, bbq sauce and pickle...it also comes with coleslaw but I'm not a big fan. :] ) , steak-cut fries, and a $11 Frozen Grasshopper shake (peppermint meringue, crunchy chocolate chip balls, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka).

Our food came out rather quickly, which was awesome because we were all starving. I took one bite of my burger and felt instant gratification! WOW! Being the carnivore that I am, I was all about the meat and it went above and BEYOND my expectations! I am also usually weary of BBQ sauces but this one was ON POINT. Not too sweet, not too spicy, just tangy enough! I was only disappointed in that they forgot to give me my dill pickle. It's okay though...the rest of the burger was so good that I'll let it slide. :D

The fries were great, and seasoned perfectly..I only wish they would have given me MOOOORE! :(

The Truffle mac and cheese was delicious and the truffle at times was overpowering, it was still lighter than other truffle mac and cheeses that we had tried. There was this one time where our truffle mac and cheese tasted like we were biting into a truffle and there was no other flavors. With that said, this one wasn't all that bad.

It was greasy, but not too greasy and they were healthier than regular fries. What could go wrong. We ordered extra.... and another extra of the sweet potato fries. Loved it that much. I do like the decor here as it was on the darker side as if you were in a higher end restaurant, but at the same time, a colorful cow mascot, which makes you think you walked into a family restaurant. A bit confusing from time to time, but as long as the food kept our stomachs happy, this was still a good choice for a quick bite.",0,0,0

These things are huge, and can easily be split amongst 2 or even 3 people.

The burgers here are divine. Excellent in flavor. Gourmet, simple, call it whatever you want,  the burgers are definitely worth it. I ordered the Captain Hook and the salmon was grilled perfectly. Not at all overcooked. The Herb Caper Mayonnaise is good, but if you are not a mayonnaise person ask for it on the side. The fries are just as delicious, you can choose between steak fries or shoestring. The steak fries are fatty. I ended up cutting off the ends and squeezing the potatoes out. Mmm, just like mash potatoes. 

The seasoned popcorn is what they give you as appetizer. I believe it is tossed with vinegar and cheese. Different, but tasty.

I can't believe it's been over four months since my last burger review, sorry for slacking but this pace won't pick up soon. Anyhoot, Vegas, burgers, cheat weekend, let's go. 

Holsteins was my pick for the start of my carb filled weekend, and what better way to indulge in all things anti-paleo than lobster mac and cheese;
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg#F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg

Flavor was spot on, noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, there was a nice crispy layer on top, and loads of lobster. But of course there was a ""but,"" a very big butt; the sauce was like water. No creamy gooey goodness to be found here, just a soupy base to the above perfection. So close this was to being a perfect mac, but someone forgot to reduce the sauce or add some flour? 

To wash all that down, what could be better than a nice refreshing milk shake, the fat boy;

Named after my favorite Harley style, this obese child contained no less than the following; Stoli Salted Karamel Veodka, Reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. All I tasted was ice cream and a hint of caramel, it was damn tasty though.

And lastly was my first bite of bread in a month, the gold standard burger; dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli, to which I felt it imperative to add a fried egg;

Overall, meh+. The sum of the parts was better than okay, not quite great, but somewhere around good. Once I began my dissection, I found the beef patty itself to be under-seasoned and without a nice crust. The bun could have used a few minutes on the grill to get a nice crust as well to protect itself from the toppings. Flavor-wise the meat was beefy, but it completely depended on the bacon for salt. I am happy to report that it was cooked to my order of med-rare;

While I don't believe it's at the same level as BurGR by Gordon Ramsey in Planet Hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!

The Place -
As I mentioned, Holstein's is located in The Cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. It's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. Casino's in Vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but Holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. At first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. The decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. The lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, I'm sure it would be fine for most haha. Because I sat at the bar, I didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. Not too bad, Holstein's.
**** 4\/5 Stars ****

The Service -
I was in Vegas for a conference and I came to Holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a Thursday. There, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, I chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. No biggie on my end as I was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which I did; however, if I was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. I found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces I've seen during my visit in Vegas. She was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which I didn't mind at all. The great service continued throughout with her making sure I was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure I was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. Great service, Holstein's and shout out to Bridgot for making my trip to Holstein's wonderful!!
***** 5\/5 Stars *****

The Food -
Just like any other of the burger joints located in Vegas, there are many different options to choose from. Each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. With that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to NOT find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. I settled for the Nom Nom Burger (See Picture) and decided to have that served with some onion rings instead of fries. First, the onion rings. Definitely not the best onion rings I've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. The Nom Nom Burger, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 Island Dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....I don't care who you are, EVERYONE did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! Haha). The burger was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 Island Dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. The only gripe I have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, I wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. Other than that, I was fairly satisfied with my selection. Good job, Holstein's.
**** 4\/5 Stars ****

Overall -
Like I said, after comparing the burgers that I've had from BurGR to Holstein's, I would definitely choose BurGR; however, if you happen to be in The Cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. I look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like The Gold Standard Burger, but all in all, not too shabby Holstein's! Thanks!",0,0,0
